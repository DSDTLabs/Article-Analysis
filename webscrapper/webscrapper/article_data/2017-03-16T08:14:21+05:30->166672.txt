LUCKNOW: Despite winning a staggering 325 seats, if   is not in a hurry to announce its   and there is a reason for it. Highly placed sources in Delhi say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants a person in the seat who can deliver up to his expectations and implement his development agenda.

 “Even if the new CM has to be remote-controlled from the PM Office, he would not mind, but his priority is implementing his vision of development in letter and spirit,” said a Union minister who visited the state frequently during the elections.
 
 We expect a totally new work culture in the state with a new-look bureaucracy, he said. Three UP cadre officers in Delhi—cabinet secretary PK Sinha, principal secretary to CM Nripendra Mishra and deputy secretary in PMO Mayur Maheshwari—are likely to give vital inputs for the selection of officers to run the PM’s development programmes.
 
 The new CM, therefore, is not only supposed to be a doer, but also a leader who could hold a firm grip on the 1,000-strong bureaucracy. The BJP brass feels that chief ministers in UP generally get surrounded by a handful of bureaucrats who don’t allow him to work independently. “This will not be repeated. The new candidate, even if inexperienced for the top post, would not be a captive in bureaucrats’ hands,” said another minister.
 
 BJP leaders feel that in the past 15 years of SP-BSP rule, there has been a set pattern of functioning and an identified group of bureaucrats who worked only on political agenda of the ruling establishment while largely ignoring the general welfare of the state. All this is going end, they said.
 
 The PM has been saying in his rallies that India can’t progress without development of UP. Now that his party is firmly in the saddle after 15 years, his priority would be to implement his development agenda. The new CM and group of top bureaucrats would be selected with this goal in mind.
