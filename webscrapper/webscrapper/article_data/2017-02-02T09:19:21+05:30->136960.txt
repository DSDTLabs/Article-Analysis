 Field officers working to motivate villagers to build toilets in their homes and use them say that many gram sabhas were close to achieving the target. 
 
 “Safe drinking water is a big issue in rural areas and this can serve as an effective incentive,” said a WASH specialist working with  . According to Census data, only 11.4% households in rural UP have access to piped drinking water. 
 
 A consultant in Hardoi said that most people banked on hand-pumps but a large number in remote villages depended on ponds, rivers and unsafe devices like khichwas (used in encephalitis-affected eastern UP). 
 
 Public health activist Dr PK Gupta stated that this is a source of diseases. “Piped drinking water will act as a second-layer attack on infections. checking open defecation being the first,” he said. 
 
 District programme communication consultant in Mirzapur Bhanu Priya said, “Lack of drinking water affects everyone. The incentive of getting water at the doorstep will allow us to convince women in villages, who will become instruments of change.”
