 GRMC was inaugurated by   on August 1, 1946, and it's the first time that it faces derecognition of seats. College authorities are hopeful of regaining the seats, though.

 MCI's PG   took the decision on November 15, 2016, on the basis of the council assessor's report. The career of at least 48 students is now in uncertainty. "Admissions done (if any) against these seats till renewal of their recognition will be irregular/illegal and not in accordance with  . Failure to seek timely renewal of recognition shall result in stoppage of admissions to the course concerned," reads the MCI letter to GRMC, a copy of which is with TOI.
 
 MCI has said that the college has to submit a compliance report within four weeks.
