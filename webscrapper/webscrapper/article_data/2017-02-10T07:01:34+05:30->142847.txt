HYDERABAD: In an attempt to prevent admissions being secured using   (SCSTOBC), the  , Hyderabad has initiated the process of creating a database with names of suspect candidates.

 Following instructions issued by the   (UGC), the JNTUH has sent out notices to all affiliated and constituent colleges to furnish details for the academic years from 2012 to 16. It wants to crack down on cases where fake caste certificates may have been used to secure admissions.
 
 With the   (MHRD) taking a serious note of such fraudulent cases, the UGC circular states that the ministry is “pressing hard“ for colleges and universities to furnish the information in a prescribed format.
 
 As per the format, all colleges have to declare standard procedure adopted to receive complaints regarding fake SCSTOBC certificates to secure admission, number of such cases recorded during the past four years, number of cases in which certificates were found to be fictitious, ac tion taken by the colleges against such students adopt ing fraudulent methods to seek admissions.
 
 “Since the verification of caste certificates is conduct ed by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education during the counselling proc ess of entrance examin ations, the university has hardly any role to play in the same. However, once we receive details from all the colleges, we will compile the consolidated data and submit it to the UGC,“ said BN Bhandari, director of academic and planning at JNTUH.
 
 'Rohith case may be trigger for scrutiny'
 
 Observers suspect the sudden scrutiny by the MHRD of fake caste certificates is following AK Roopanwal's report on death of Rohith Vemula, the Dalit scholar who committed suicide at UoH in 2016. The commission stated in its report that Vemula's mother “faked“ his caste certificate.“It might be because of Rohith.but will affect many others,“ said an expert. TNN
