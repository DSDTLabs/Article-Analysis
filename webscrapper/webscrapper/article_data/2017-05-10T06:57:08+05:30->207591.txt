Thane: A 20-year-old Mumbra woman was arrested for allegedly strangling her husband, Mehndi   (26). The accused,  , a housewife, has been granted police custody till May 15. Sayyed was found dead at his   house on Monday. 

 “When we questioned her, she fumbled for a coherent reply. She told us that when she woke up, she saw her dupatta wrapped tightly around her husband’s neck. After she failed to untie the knot, she cut the cloth with scissors and threw it in the dustbin,” said a police officer.
 
 But the mother of a 13-month-old had a different version to tell relatives. “Sayyed’s uncle told us he had rushed his nephew to a hospital after Zahra called him to inform that her husband was unconscious. When they took him to a private hospital, the doctors declared him dead before arrival,” said the police officer.
 
 Zahra’s insistence on speeding up her husband’s cremation aroused her relatives’ suspicion. “When Sayyed was to be buried, his uncle spotted marks around his neck and suspected foul play. More so, because his wife seemed eager to speed up the burial without waiting to complete medical and police formalities. He immediately called the police,” said an officer.
 
 Another police officer said, “There could have been some domestic issues. She is not cooperating so we have sought her police custody.” Two days before his death, Sayyed had shared the PINs of his   with his wife.
