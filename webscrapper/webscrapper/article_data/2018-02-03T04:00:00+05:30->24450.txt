Surat: Twenty Congress councillors of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) were among the many party workers detained by Surat police at Mugalsarai while holding a demonstration against the tax hikes proposed in the SMC’s draft budget for 2018-19 on Friday. 

 A couple of Congress councillors had even managed to reach mayor Asmita Shiroya’s house in Karanj to sever drain and water connections of her house, but were held. The detained Congress leaders, including city unit party president Hasmukh Desai and leader of opposition in SMC Papan Togadia, were later released by the police. 
 
 The Congress councillors led a rally of party workers from Gandhi Pratima in Chowk Bazaar to SMC headquarters at Mugalsarai. They shouted slogans against BJP, which is controlling SMC, and later submitted a memorandum to municipal commissioner flaying the proposed tax hikes in the budget.
 
 “We would continue with our agitation until the tax hikes in the budget are withdrawn. People can’t afford a hike of Rs 543 crore in a single year,” Togadia said.
