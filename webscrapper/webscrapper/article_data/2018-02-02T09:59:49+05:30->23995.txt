MUMBAI: Buoyed by a six-race winning streak, Bangalore challenger   is likely to start this Sunday's Indian Derby at the   as the favourite.

 Multi-classic winner Prevalent Force will be up against two fillies with an impressive track record - local star Manifold and Hyderabad queen Lady In Lace.
 
 "He has taken the travel well,"  , the trainer of Prevalent Force, told 
 on Tuesday.
 
 "He has been travelling all over and he is used it now," added the 44-year-old who has won the Indian Derby twice before with Supervite (1999) and Psychic Flame (2004).
 
 Prevalent Force, the son of Multidimensional, arrived last Sunday, just a week before the big race, but Byramji was confident that it would make no difference. "He is a great competitor. Once he takes to the track, he knows what he has to do. Even the pace of the race doesn't affect him. Whether he is coming off the pace or otherwise, he is ready to do his best whenever asked," said the son of legendary trainer  .
 
 Barring his debut run in Bengaluru last March, Prevalent Force has never been beaten since in six starts. "He had accidently banged his head at the gates at the start of his debut run. He then kept on running in a daze and finished fifth. Even after returning to the paddock, he was still in shock and his head was swollen," revealed Byramji.
 
 Sounding confident that his horse would rise to the occasion on Sunday, Byramji said: "Among the two main fillies, my horse has easily beaten Lady In Lace in Deccan Derby last October but he is yet to match strides with Manifold. We will see Manifold in the race on Sunday."
 
 Byramji believed Prevalent Force would come into his own by next year as he was still maturing. "He has still not filled his frame and still mentally maturing. "As a baby, he had a big setback when he had a bout of uncontrollable loose motions for over eight days which had left him battling for his life. He took many months to recover," Byramji revealed.
