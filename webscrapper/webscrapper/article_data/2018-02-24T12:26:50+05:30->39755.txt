PUNE: Closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras will be installed on three trains originating from the Pune division in the first phase of the railways’ plan to install   cameras on all trains and at stations.

With the railways having taken a decision to install around 19,000 cameras at 983 stations at an approved cost of Rs 500 crore, sources in the Pune division said that the requisition to install cameras under the same scheme had been sent to the railway board.
