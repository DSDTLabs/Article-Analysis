Hubballi: A video of a police sub-inspector assaulting 2 youth with a belt at Koppal town police station, went viral on social media on Friday.

 The clip shows 2 youth, who allegedly jumped a traffic signal, being beaten by the sub-inspector.
 
 Sources said the police let the youth off after giving them a warning, and didn’t book any case against them.
 
 A group of devotees attending the Gavisiddeshwar Jatra, alleged that police personnel deployed to manage the crowd at the Gavisiddeshwar mutt premises, used obscene language against the public, and misbehaved with them. “The police unnecessarily took 2 youth to the police station in the morning, and assaulted them,” they alleged.
 
 Town police station inspector Ravi Ukkund alleged that the motorbike was being driven rashly by the youth, and that they had jumped a traffic signal. “Our personnel brought them to the police station and warned them not to repeat such acts in the future,” he added.
 
 However, sources said after the video went viral, the police started mulling, by evening, whether to file an FIR against the youth or not.
 
 Koppal superintendent of police Anoop Shetty did not respond when TOI called him over phone.
