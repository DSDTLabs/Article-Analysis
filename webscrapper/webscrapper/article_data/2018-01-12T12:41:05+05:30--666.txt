NEW DELHI: Calling the "mysterious death" of CBI judge Brijgopal Loya a "serious issue", the   today asked the Maharashtra government to produce all the documents related to the case by Monday.

 
 Supreme Court was hearing a plea seeking an independent probe into the death of special CBI judge Loya, who was hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case.
 
 When senior advocates Dushyant Dave and Indira Jaising pleaded the SC bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra not to hear the case on Loya's mysterious death as matter is pending in Bombay HC, the bench said that it will examine the case.
 
 The plea was filed by Maharashtra-based journalist B R Lone. He submitted that a fair probe was needed into the mysterious death of Loya, who was hearing the sensitive Sohrabuddin encounter case in which various police officers and BJP president Amit Shah were named as parties.
 
 Loya died of a cardiac arrest in Nagpur on December 1, 2014, when he had gone to attend the wedding of a colleague's daughter.
 
 The issue came under the spotlight in November last year after media reports quoting his sister fuelled suspicion about the circumstances surrounding his death and its link to the Sohrabuddin case.
