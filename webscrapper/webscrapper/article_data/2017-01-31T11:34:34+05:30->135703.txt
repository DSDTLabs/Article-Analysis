 Another PMDS official said, “People prefer going to the temple over the weekends. On an average, we receive lakhs of devotees on weekends, but the number of devotees had dropped post demonetisation. Now, however, the daily visitors’ number has gone back to how it was before demonetisation. The livelihood of vendors in the temple premises also depends on the number of devotees as they get good business when the footfall in the temple rises.”
 
 Senior inspector of   of the city police  , said, “We had demarcated separate parking slots for two-wheelers, cars, and buses. This prevented traffic chaos during the extended four-day weekend. The turnout was high on Republic Day. Most of the vehicles were from Pune, Mumbai, Solapur, Osmanabad and Karnataka.”
