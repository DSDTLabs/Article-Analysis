MUMBAI: Yet another senior citizen from the city has become a victim of the civic corporation’s apathy.

 
  (71), a resident of   in  , was injured after she tripped over rubble strewn over a footpath. The elderly woman has fractured her fingers and also suffered bruises on her face and legs. Speaking to 
  on Tuesday, she said that the incident took place on May 4.
 
 “My husband and I were out on our morning walk. We left home around 7am to go to the nearby ground and started walking back around 7.45am. My husband was walking ahead of me when I noticed rubble strewn on the footpath. In order to avoid the stones, I stepped a little ahead and within no time, I was bang on the ground,” she said.
 
 Her husband, Narayanan, said that when he turned back to see what had happened, he found his wife on the ground and her face was bleeding. “We avoided taking the road adjoining the footpath as it was uneven, but we didn’t think something like this would happen,” he said.
 
 Narayanan then rushed his wife back home, wiped his wife’s wound and applied an ointment to stop the bleeding. The couple then visited a doctor in the afternoon. The doctor advised the woman to get an X-ray, which revealed that two of her fingers had been fractured due to the fall.
 
 “For the next few days after the incident, I needed help even to go to the washroom,” she said.
 
 Her husband, who has written to the local municipal ward office about the incident, said that the area is home to several elderly couples. “If the   officials are genuinely interested in doing something and improving the area, it can surely be done. It’s important that some corrective measures are taken so that such an incident does not happen again,” he said.
 
 S Ghag, who is in-charge of the M West ward, told 
  the road repair work is in progress by a ‘central agency’. “We have received a complaint about a woman falling. I have forwarded the concerns to the central road work department,” he said.
