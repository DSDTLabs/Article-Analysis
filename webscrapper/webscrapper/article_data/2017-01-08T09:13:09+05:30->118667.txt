CHENNAI: Records and titles speak volumes about the greatness of  , the leader, at least in limited-overs cricket. But there is more to Dhoni than captaincy and cricket. In an interview post the 2011 World Cup triumph, Dhoni had said: "I have three dogs at home. Even after losing a series or winning a series, they treat me the same way. Getting up quite late in the morning, going to clean my bikes, spending some time with my family and friends, going out for rides with my friends and having lunch or dinner at a roadside hotel - that's my favourite time-pass."

 Australian legend  , who has played under the leadership of Dhoni in  , said one of Dhoni's greatest qualities as a skipper was that he made his players "realise" that cricket was "not the most important thing" in a person's life.
 
 "Dhoni was an inspirational leader and I loved playing under him. He gave the players perspective and made them realise that though cricket is important, it is not the most important thing in a person's life," Hussey told TOI on Saturday.
 
 'Mr Cricket' Hussey added: "He has helped the Indian team to so much success in all forms of the game, but an even better person with a great family. His calmness...he had this amazing ability to help players relax, enjoy the game and not put too much pressure on themselves, which is not that easy in a place like India where cricket is a religion." The 41-year-old Hussey has played under three very successful captains -  ,   and Dhoni - for different teams. "They all led according to their personalities and were all very good in their own ways," Hussey said.
 
 The Aussie mentioned that Dhoni has stepped down from captaincy only after leaving Indian cricket in a strong position. "He obviously thinks this is the best time for the team and for Indian cricket to move on."
