MUMBAI: An early lead for the   in   state election's results took the   on Tuesday to an over three-month high of nearly 36,000. But the initial euphoria among   traders faded as talk of a Congress-JD(S) alliance gained momentum, pulling the index down to close in the red. The sensex hit an intra-day high of 35,994, up about 440 points, before sinking to a low of 35,498 and finally closing 13 points lower at 35,544.

 
 The market's disappointment came from the fact that, in the closing days of the Karnataka poll process, traders were expecting a BJP win, which was reflected in the late rally on Friday. According to Motilal Oswal Securities head (retail research) Siddharth Khemka, investors usually prefer a stable government and a decisive mandate is something the markets always take positively.
 
 "Going by last few weeks' trends, markets were factoring in a decisive win for the BJP. While they may be short of the majority mark, the BJP has emerged as the single largest party and that trend is something that could help them in the upcoming general elections," Khemka said.
 
 With a series of state elections scheduled before the Lok Sabha elections in less than a year, market players now see volatility as the rule. In addition, the weakness of the rupee, geopolitical developments, domestic corporate results over the next few quarters and also the health of the economy would play a major role in deciding market trend, they said.
