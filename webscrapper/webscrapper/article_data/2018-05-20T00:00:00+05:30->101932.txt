If there’s one shoe that you’ll buy this year, make sure it’s the  . And not just the garden-variety in plain leather – that’s old news. The new   is a pop piece with zari, fabric, in catchy neon colours and even in denim. You can don one with a smart white top and jeans, for office wear and with shorts and shirt too. It’s the current DIY darling with young college girls who are designing their own juttis and giving it a makeover with ghungroos and zardozi. 

 Footwear designer and entrepreneur   designed her own juttis for her wedding day. The shoes were a big hit, enough to give her an idea to start a jutti company. “Juttis are ‘the’ Indian ballerina shoes. They are gaining immense popularity with each passing year,” she says. 
 
 
 Juttis have a fascinating history. Maharajas and maharanis in the Mughal era wore it for comfort and elegance. While crafting these shoes, shoemakers made sure that the toe cleavage was visible as it made the feet look sexy. Designers are now experimenting with the form with new necklines for the shoes, modern patterns, contemporary embroideries and surface techniques. Sangha says, “Fluid shapes, 3D embroideries in Chantilly lace, glass crystals, translucent thread work are popular accents.”
 Footwear designer Laksheeta Govil has experimented with the traditional form of the jutti. Result: the broguesters that combines the sensibility of a jutti with the style of a brogue. “It’s good to experiment to make it a part of your everyday wardrobe. We’ve jutti sneakers, brogues, loafer juttis, slip on juttis,” she says. 
 
 
 Celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Kangana Ranaut, among others are recent jutti converts. Kapoor, in fact, had juttis as favours for her sangeet ceremony! Govil says what works in juttis’ favour is that you can wear them for hours without any pain. “They are super versatile and easy to pair. Customers send us pictures of the juttis they’ve worn on their holidays from the temples and beaches of Bali to the chic streets of Paris,” she adds. So, looking for a new shoe? Go back in time to the jutti – only now it has got a sassy makeover.
 
 
 - Store them wrapped in a cloth – preferably muslin. It’s best to store them in a closed box or bag.
 - Once in a while, clean them with a damp towel or cotton cloth. Leave it out in the sun for some time.
 - If they are very dirty use a mild cleanser.
 - If your jutti uses silk, dry clean only.
 - If the shoe is pinching, line the inside with mustard oil and leave for a day – it helps to soften the leather.
