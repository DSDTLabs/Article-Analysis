NEW DELHI: A Hyderabad-bound Vistara aircraft had to return to   soon after taxiing out on Wednesday as a passenger belatedly remembered he had kept a   in his checked-in bag.

 Till the time the bag with powerbank was offloaded, the maximum duty time of the crew had exceeded when the aircraft reached Hyderabad. So the flight, UK-879, which had a schedule departure of 5.40pm, finally took off after three hours of delay and with a fresh crew. 
 
 E-cigarettes, powerbanks and loose lithium batteries are strictly prohibited in check-in luggage due to fears of them catching fire. While the CISF is responsible for hand bag and passenger screening, check-in bags are screened by airport security teams. Vistara has taken up the issue with   ( ) as to how did the security miss the powerbank in the luggage.
 
 “The aircraft (had) to return after a passenger told us he had accidentally put a powerbank in his checked luggage. We… regret there is nothing we could have done to avoid this delay as safety is our first priority. We could not depart with powerbank in the luggage hold,” Vistara said in a series of tweets.
 
 While powerbanks are banned in check-in bags, airlines are now recommending even large personal electronic devices (PED) like laptops and batteries be carried in hand bags and not be checked in.
