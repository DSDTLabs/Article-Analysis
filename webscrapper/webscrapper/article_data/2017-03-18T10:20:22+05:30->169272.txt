BHUBANESWAR: As if raw material shortage in the state is not enough to paralyse industries, rubbing salt into the wound the   (OMC) could start production of only seven of the   to it. 

 The OMC, a state PSU, has 11 chromite and iron ore mines each, five iron and manganese, three manganese, two gemstone and one bauxite, limestone and coal mine each, official sources said. Though the OMC got the bauxite and coal mines recently, it has possessed the other blocks for several decades. 
 
 Steel and mines minister   said the mining blocks are not operating due to want of different statutory clearances like environment clearance, forest clearance, consent to operate, consent to establish and lack of mining plan and mining scheme. Kolha-Roida, Gandhamardhan-B, Daitari, Kurmitar, South Kaliapani, Sukurangi and Bangur are the seven blocks which are in operation.
 
 In 2016-17, the state PSU produced more than 65 lakh tonne of ore by February-end. It aims to enhance its production to 200 lakh tonne by 2020. Shortage of bauxite has forced Vedanta's Lanjigarh refinery in Kalahandi district to cut down on production against its capacity. Only 60% of the refinery is operational.
 
 Lack of raw material had forced the company to shut its refinery in December, 2012. The plant was reopened in July 2013.
 
 When Vedanta chairman   had met chief minister   in August last year, the state government had assured Vedanta to ensure bauxite through the OMC. Similarly, of nearly 108 sponge iron units in Odisha, more than 30 units have faced closure due to acute shortage of raw materials and recurring losses.
 
 But, the OMC is producing adequate raw material required by the plants within Odisha. "We are even selling ore outside the state," Mallik told TOI.
 
 He said the OMC has been instructed to expedite the process of clearances to ramp up its production.
