New Delhi: Days after the   pulled up   for failing to remove blockade from its administrative building, the varsity on Tuesday moved court seeking police intervention.

 In a petition that is likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday, JNU sought directions from police to remove the blockade permanently and also to set up a perimeter around the administrative block which will be out of bounds for dharnas and demonstrations.
 
 Seeking HC’s intervention, the university stated that it was unable to pay its staff this month’s salary due to the 20-day-old blockade. It also pleaded helplessness in distributing certificates, degrees and other official documents to other students since access to the vice chancellor’s office and the administrative office was restricted.
 
 JNU informed   that it has lodged FIRs against agitating students with the local police station and wanted normalcy restored at the earliest.
 
 Earlier this month, HC had wondered why JNU had not yet sought legal remedy if access to the administrative block of the varsity was being blocked by students since February 9. HC’s poser had come while hearing a plea by five students of the varsity that they be provided with their mark-sheets and certificates as they had to apply for various courses and jobs.
 
 When the court asked JNU to provide documents, central government standing counsel  , appearing for JNU, informed that police assistance would be required to enter administrative block adding that “Even the VC was not able to enter his office.” 
 
 The students also sought removal of the protesters and restoration of functioning of the varsity’s administrative block. They pointed out that no protest could be staged within 20 metres of the administrative and academic complexes as per JNU’s Academic Rules and Regulations.
