AHMEDABAD: While   claim having intensified efforts to curb vector-borne diseases, data of AMC’s health department shows that in   alone, 9,277 people in the city suffered from malaria. These are only conservative estimates and the actual numbers may be higher because   only seeks data from civic body-run hospitals, urban health centres and select private hospitals.

 Interestingly, at 10,094 cases in 2016, the number of malaria cases were at an eight-year high. Even though the cases have declined, it is merely by 8.09%, with intensive efforts. It may be worthy to note that earlier in 2017, the state government had launched an ambitious project ‘Malaria-free   by 2022’.
 
 In fact, it was the same year when the   (WHO) confirmed three cases of zika virus infections. Zika infection is usually caused by Aedes aegypti mosquito which also causes dengue and chikungunya. On that note, some 253 cases of chikungunya and 1,059 cases of dengue were reported in Ahmedabad in 2017 in addition to 1,309 cases of falciparum malaria.
 
 According to the figures by National Vector-Borne Disease Control programme, some six people in Gujarat died of dengue and malaria in 2017. Of these, two died of malaria while four died from dengue.
