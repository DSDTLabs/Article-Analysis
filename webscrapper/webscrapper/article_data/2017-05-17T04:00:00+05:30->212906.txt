Chennai: Mumbai-based   startup   has bagged Series-B   of $3 million from Innovations East, a fund managed by people with experience in marketplaces and online payments.

 Founded in 2014, Telr is a payment gateway aggregator of multiple payment methods like cards and online banking, offering a set of unified APIs and tools that enable businesses to accept and manage online payments via web, mobile and social media. 
 
 With growth of over $500 million worth transactions annually, Telr anticipates reaching transactions worth $1 billion transactions per year by the end of 2017. Telr has raised funds from investors in Singapore and the Middle East, including Hatcher and iMena Holdings earlier.
 
 Sirish Kumar, CEO and co-founder, Telr said, “Our plan is to focus on particular sectors and customise solutions for them. We are now serving companies in sectors including hotels, cabling companies, gifting solutions, yachts, society management and government entities. With our anti-fraud and risk management solutions, we are able to offer a full stack payment platform.” The investment will be used to enhance Telr’s core product proposition, roll out new payment methods and scale up operations in focus markets, especially India and other emerging markets. Funds will also be deployed, through selective partnerships, in creating an ecosystem for SMEs seeking to take their businesses online — with initiatives such as a web store.
 
 They are also planning to license technology to large enterprise players.
