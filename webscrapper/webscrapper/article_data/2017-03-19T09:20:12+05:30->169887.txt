HYDERABAD: Higher education institutions in the country have become 'over-regulated' and 'under-governed', said member of parliament   on Saturday, expressing concern over educational policies. 

 Addressing students at the   (UoH) , Tharoor said that universities across India are controlled by regulating bodies such as University Grants Commission and  . "There is too much control from the top. Right from the curriculum to size of the classrooms is fixed by the regulating bodies," said Tharoor, adding how there is no autonomy for the educational institutions in the country. 
 
 Raising concerns over lack of equality in educational institutions, he paid tribute to  , the Dalit scholar who committed suicide in UoH in January last year.
 
 While the ministry of human resource development is planning to revamp India's technical education, Tharoor spoke of how information technology firms are acting as universities to train students. "Too many students are not ready for the prime-time in the industry. Students come out of institutions ill-equipped, as a result of which several big IT companies have set-up campuses where they train students skills that they are supposed to be taught in universities," said Tharoor. 
 
 He also stressed the need to have higher interaction between academia and industry. He raised concerns over the lack of research and innovation in the country. "In the US, several companies come forward and offer research projects to university-students. They offer grants to research scholars and also profit if the product is launched in the market. This is something unheard of in India," said Tharoor, adding how majority rankings of universities rely on research papers, citations and journals filed by the university.
