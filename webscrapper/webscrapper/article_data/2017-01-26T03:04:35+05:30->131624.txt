THANE: City   are celebrating   by organizing   based on themes revolving around initiatives set off by the government. 

 Father Michael Pinto, principal, St. John the Baptist School, said, “We have planned activities ranging from a tribute to our army and defence to skits, dances, street plays and other activities on topics of digital India, inclusive India and Swachh Bharat. There is a lot of negativity in the society, but there are also a number of positive and growing trends. Through these events, our teachers, students and their parents will remember these events.
 
 Many schools have extended the activities for Republic Day celebrations and marked it as a patriotic week.
 
 Simmi Juneja, principal of DAV public school, said, “Topics like Republic Day, Indian history and importance of the preamble are only limited to history textbooks. On this day, we decided to change that trend and organise a week-long celebration filled with debates on these topics, discussions on Swachh Bharat, technology and so on.”
