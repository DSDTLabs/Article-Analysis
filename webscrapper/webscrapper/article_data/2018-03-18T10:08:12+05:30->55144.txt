MUMBAI: The   (WR) is likely to demolish the   outside the   to create space for wider circulating area as there has been a steady increase in footfall on the former mill land.

 The station has been a focus of attention of the authorities after 23 people were killed in a  , 2017.
  
  
 A WR official said, "A wider circulating area can be created only by relocating the staff quarters in three buildings. We have additional space in the adjoining land parcels where the occupants can be shifted. The plan is still in a preliminary stage and we are undertaking the cost benefit analysis of such a move.” The railway quarters are on 1000 sq m of land.
 
 Around 3-3.5 lakh people use the Elphinstone Road-Parel stations to visit not only corporate offices in the region but also KEM and Tata Cancel hospitals. 
 
 To handle the rush,   (CR) has begun work on Parel Terminal by building additional platform between Elphinstone Road and Parel. The platform, which is likely to open in May, will handle Parel-originating trains.
 
 The WR official said, “The opening of a new platform will lead to further increase in passengers as there will more trains terminating and originating at Parel. Some load will be taken off Dadar, but Parel will become more busier."
 
 The officer said, "At present, the access road to the FOB, where the stampede occurred, is 4.6 metres wide. This is sufficient but the additional space created will help wider circulating area." The space will also be used for building a booking office and emergency medical room, besides other passenger amenities. "The stalls on the platform too can be cleared and relocated here,” he added.
 
 Once the proposal is finalised, estimates will be prepared for approval of the WR headquarters. 
 
 To ensure faster dispersal of commuters, the railways had roped in the Army to built an FOB. WR also relocated the booking office on this FOB to build additional staircase facing Dadar-end.
