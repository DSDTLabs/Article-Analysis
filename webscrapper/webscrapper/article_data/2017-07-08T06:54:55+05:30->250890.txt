LUCKNOW: Following the central government’s recent exercise to gear up for dismissing nearly a dozen   officers for poor performance and corruption, besides initiating the process for   of another 150, the Uttar Pradesh government too has issued directives to clear government departments of deadwood after a time-bound performance appraisal of those having crossed 50 years.

 The order, issued by chief secretary Rajive Kumar, is aimed at improving the work culture and efficiency of the state apparatus.   Aditya Nath Yogi is apparently trying to lead by example by sitting in his office as late as midnight to review the presentations and performance of the departments. In order to make the state machinery more responsive and sensitive to the grievances of the people, Yogi is also holding videoconferences and warning district level officers if petty grievances reach the state headquarters or if people had to approach him with their problems. 
 
 In pursuance of the CM’s determination, the chief secretary refreshed a 1985 order of the state government on Thursday, which empowers the state to sack anyone without mentioning any reason after serving a notice, by issuing it to all the additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and department heads, stating that this exercise of appraisal of employees over 50 years should be completed by July 31.
 
 The department of personnel and training uploaded the orders of the chief secretary on its official website on Thursday night, sending the state bureaucracy into a tizzy. Governments in the past have tried to implement the order in 1989, 2001 and 2007, but had to step back due to mass protests.
 
 In his renewed orders, quoting the past GOs, the chief secretary has clarified that the exercise of compulsory   has to be undertaken at a large-scale and all the department heads are directed to complete it within the stipulated period.
 
 To review the performance, the state government has also declared the cut off date as March 31, 2017 of those having crossed 50 years.
