Coimbatore: The rural police on Friday flagged off several Alpha bike squads to bring down casualties in road accidents and prevent crimes including chain snatching. Inspector general of police (west zone) A Pari handed over 20 motorcycles to the squad at the police recruitment school (PRS) campus. District superintendent of police Pa Moorthy said that four police personnel will be allotted to a squad, who will work in three shifts. “Two personnel will ride on the vehicles, fitted with a siren to patrol respective areas. They have been provided with helmets, first-aid-kits and a flashlight,” he said. The squad will help those who meet with road accidents, Moorthy told TOI. “They will send the victims to the nearby hospital. They will also check chain snatching incidents. We plan to train them in tactics riding so that they can nab chain snatchers on two-wheelers,” he said. Many chain snatching cases were reported from Sulur, Thudiyalur and Pollachi East police stations last year. The three stations got two alpha motorcycles each. Rest of the 17 vehicles were handed over to Mettupalayam, Karamadai, Periyanaickenpalayam, Kinathukadavu, Madukkarai, Perur, Vadavalli, Negamam, Mahalingapuram, Anaimalai, Kottur, Karumathampatti, Annur and Kovilpalayam police stations. “We plan to fix GPS devices on the motorcycles. That would help us to monitor the movements of the squads from the control room. Thus, senior officer will be able to instruct them from the control room,” said Moorthy. As many as 680 fatal road accidents were reported from rural Coimbatore in 2017, which killed 720 people. While eight people were killed during January 1-January 04 in 2017, only five people lost lives this year during the same period. As many as 51 chain snatching incidents were reported from various parts of the district last year.
