CHENNAI: Opposition parties in   - including the DMK, Congress, CPM and DMDK - on Sunday blamed the state and central governments for the troubles that students appearing for the NEET entrance exam had to endure. However, state BJP president blamed the CBSE for the whole muddle. 

 "It is high time we put an end to the NEET, which is taking a death toll year after year. We should all fight with all legal might to bring this to an end," DMK working president M K Stalin said, while condoling the death of S   - father of NEET aspirant Kasthuri Mahalingam - in Ernakulam.
 
 CPM state general secretary,   said the state government should have prevented students from the trouble that they had to endure to travel to other states to write the exam. He squarely blamed the death of Krishnasamy on the state and the central governments.
 
 DMDK general secretary,   questioned the state government for agreeing to everything that the Centre brings forth. "If the exams had been held only within the state for all the students, such a death and troubles to students could have been avoided," he said in a statement.
