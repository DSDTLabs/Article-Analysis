JAIPUR: A survey conducted by a social organisation on e-cigarettes has highlighted how e-cigarettes are now widely available in shops. The survey shows e-cigarettes were found available at 18 per cent out of the 687 shops surveyed in Kota and at 8 per cent of 450 shops surveyed in Jaipur. 

 
 Organisation’s secretary   said, that the most important need for tobacco control in the state is to reduce the availability of tobacco which can be done only to control the sale of tobacco. In such a situation, the recent announcement by department of local bodies, to make licences necessary for the tobacco vendors, need to be executed soon.
 
 He was speaking at a media sensitization workshop held in Jaipur on Tuesday, prior to the ‘World No Tobacco Day’ (May 31). Dr Rakesh Gupta, consultant, Tobacco Cessation at a private hospital, said that the   is the biggest obstacle in tobacco control in terms of new consumers, existing consumers and tobacco-quitters. 
 
 Gupta said that according to established figures, 3,000 new people start tobacco consumption every day in Rajasthan, which is likely to go from e-cigarette to active smoking. He said that since the e-cigarette is being propagated by the companies as helpful in quitting smoking, those people who are likely to quit smoking can start using e-cigarettes. 
 
 He said in such a situation, the number of people who quit smoking will be reduced. It will be quite disappointing because according to   -2, the data of those who quit smoking in the state are not encouraging. Apart from those who have quit smoking, they may start smoking again after the use of e-cigarettes. 
 
 Dr Gupta said that nicotine is present in liquid form in e-cigarette. Apart from this, glycon, glycerol and heavy metal are also found to be harmful to health.
 
  MLA from Nohar, Abhishek Mutoria said as part of the government, he will advocate this to the government so that the e-cigarette is also banned in Rajasthan.
