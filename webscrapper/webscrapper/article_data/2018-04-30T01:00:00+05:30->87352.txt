PATNA: CPI (ML) state secretary Kunal on Sunday flayed the Centre for “handing over the Red Fort to a private entity” and said it was similar to “selling the national heritage site”.

 “This decision shows the pro-corporate stance of the BJP-led Union government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Kunal said while interacting with mediapersons in Patna two days before the ‘Janadhikar Mahasammelan’ that the CPI (ML) has planned to hold at Gandhi Maidan on May 1.
 
 Other Left parties active in the state — CPI, CPM, Socialist Unity Centre of India, Revolutionary Socialist Party and Forward Bloc — have been requested to send representatives to participate in the ‘Mahasammelan’. Party general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya will be the main speaker on the occasion.
 
 Kunal was accompanied by party functionaries Amar and Santosh Sahar.
