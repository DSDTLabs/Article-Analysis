A certain section of viewers revealing the thrills and suspense of films through social media, uploading videos of the same and the like is not new in Mollywood or any industry. However, gone are the days when actors and the film crew keep quiet about such disruptive trends.

 Recently, messages and trolls about the suspense of the latest Malayalam release 'Ezra' have been circulating on various instant messaging platforms. After Ezra's lead actor Prithviraj came out with a strong reaction against the same, his co-star   has also taken to his social media page to express angst and anger. "What would you call those selfish people who watch movies filled with suspense and twist, right on the first day of the release, only to reveal them on social media? What would you call those who go to theaters only to pass comments and disturb the viewers?" he asks on his page. 
 
 Ezra has Prithviraj and   as a young couple who move to a house in Fort Kochi, only to be troulbled by supernatural experiences.
