BENGALURU: Two armed miscreants murdered a   at a   on   during a   in the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. 

 Hebbagodi police said the incident took place after midnight and was recorded by the CCTV cameras installed in the eatery. The victim, Samir, 26, from Odisha, used to live at the pizza outlet where he had been working for the past year.
 
 “Two   entered the outlet around 12.20am when there were only two persons inside. They approached Samir and asked him for money. One of them stabbed him in the left thigh and rushed towards his colleague Manjunath. They demanded money (speaking in English) and Manjunath handed over Rs 20,000 to the duo before they fled the scene,” police said, adding that it all transpired in five minutes.
 
 Police said Manjunath began to chase the robbers and his colleague Chinnu joined him. “However, they couldn’t catch the duo. When Manjunath returned to the outlet, he found that Samir had collapsed on the floor. The   was rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival,” cops added.
 
 A senior police officer said Samir’s parents haven’t been able to come to Bengaluru to claim his body due to poor finances. It has been handed over to his cousin. “We have analysed the CCTV footage and have some clues about the killers. We will arrest them soon,” said SK Umesh, deputy superintendent of police (Bengaluru sub-division).
 
 ‘He may have died due to shock’
 
 Although the stab wound was about half-an-inch deep, police said there wasn’t too much bleeding. Quoting doctors, they said Samir may have died due to shock rather than the impact of the injury. Samir’s colleague Manjunath told police that Chinnu and he also lived with Samir at the outlet and that the door was half open when the robbers entered as Chinnu had gone out to park his bike. Manjunath said he hadn’t noticed the stab wound when he began chasing the miscreants and only learnt about it upon his return.
