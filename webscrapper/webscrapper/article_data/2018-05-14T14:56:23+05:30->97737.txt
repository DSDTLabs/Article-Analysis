MARGAO:   villagers opposed the central government’s proposed ‘Adopt a Heritage’ scheme, as well as the notified Regional Plan (RP) 2021, during the gram sabha meeting held on Sunday.

 The gram sabha passed unanimous resolutions demanding the immediate scrapping of the RP 2021, and firmly opposing the ‘Adopt a Heritage’ scheme. 
 
 A Nuvem villager,   proposed these resolutions. “RP 2021 is in force without considering any planning and suggestions from the local village level committee appointed by the panchayat during the gram sabha. All eco-sensitive areas should be excluded from settlement zones, and there is a need for a new pro-Goa plan to be drafted for the sustainable development of the state,” Andrade said. 
 
 Nuvem panchayat secretary   told TOI that the revised annual budget of Rs 3 crore, administrative reports and annual accounts were approved at the gram sabha that was attended by eight panch members of the 11-member panchayat.
