NASHIK: Nationalist Congress Party chief   on Thursday said he opposed the govenment’s decision to present   on February 1.

  Pawar said, “Government should not present budget before the   to five states are over. We will soon meet the President   on the issue.” 
 
 Several opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the DMK and the JD (U), today met with   (EC) officials to demand the postponement of the Union Budget to after elections are over in the five states.
 
 The Union budget is expected to be presented on February 1 and polls in five states are scheduled to start on February 4. Opposition parties fear the BJP will announce sops and other programs to sway voters towards them. This would be a violation of the Model Code of Conduct, they said.
 
 An 11-member delegation of opposition party members met with EC officials on Thursday.
