BATHINDA: Punjab finance minister   has accused the previous SAD-BJP government of patronizing   leading to losses for liquor contractors in the 2016-17 financial year. 

 This was the reason for initial hesitation seen in bidding for the liquor vends for the current fiscal year, he claimed.
 
 Interestingly, SAD leader and liquor contractor Deep Malhotra, who was elected as an MLA from Faridkot in 2012, met Manpreet Badal on Friday at the Bathinda circuit house. Malhotra's family on Wednesday night had got two groups of liquor vends in Bathinda.
 
 Manpreet said, "As per our information, the previous government patronized the liquor smugglers. Deep Malhotra came to me to tell that he suffered lot of losses in the previous year in liquor business due to illegal sale of liquor. He wanted an assurance from us that liquor smugglers would not be allowed to operate.
 
 "I assured that the Congress government was completely with those who did their business honestly and no one would be allowed to sell liquor illegally."
 
 Gaurav Wines, controlled by Deep and his son Dimpy Malhotra, got liquor vends in two groups in Bathinda through auction on Wednesday.
 
  While there have been reports that some other firm controlled by Deep's family owed crores to the state government in licence fee for the previous year in Faridkot, he denied that any of his companies had defaulted.
