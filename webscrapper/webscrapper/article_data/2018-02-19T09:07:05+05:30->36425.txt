VADODARA: After a gap of over two decades, a   for health and sanitation of workers employed at   (ESIS) Hospital at Gotri Road was organized in the city on Sunday. 

 The workshop was conducted by   - an organization based out of Switzerland, the Medical Students Association of India and Worker on Demand (WOD). A mobile app developed by a city-based doctor targeted 120 staffers of ESIS Hospital. 
 
 “We had conducted the workshop ‘Aid for Unwaged’ to impart education and spread awareness among the workers regarding health and hygiene as they are the ones who are daily exposed to number of patients suffering from diseases like HIV, TB and malaria among others,” said Dr Anuj Kodnani, who along with two other city-based doctors - Pankti Shah and Deval Patel conducted the workshop. 
 
 The workers were also provided tips to polish their skill set and achieve better wages. Kodnani has developed WOD, a mobile app through which such workers can get part-time or full-time work when they are not working at the hospital. 
 
 “WOD is an employment platform for such blue-collar workers and it acts as a bridge between the customers and the workers,” he said, adding that through the app, the workers can get daily surplus income.
