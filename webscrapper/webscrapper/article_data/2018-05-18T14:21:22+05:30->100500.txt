MADURAI: A new allegation has been raised against   temple by   founder president A  . He has alleged that the 50 acres of land opposite   bus stand had been encroached upon and steps should to be taken to retrieve it. He also said that the land which was given to the temple by Sooravali Suppaiyar Trust decades ago could be worth several crores of rupees.

 Radhakrishnan said that the land was donated to earn revenue from it and use the same to conduct rituals and special poojas to the deities. If the temple decides to lease out these land parcels, it had to be properly publicised in the surrounding areas and the lease amount obtained in advance. Fifteen per cent of the revenue should be used for the temple and the rest must be deposited in the account of the trust which donated the land. The accounts had to be audited annually and placed for public viewing and also for the decedents of Sooravali Suppaiyar. The detailed account has to be published in the Madurai districtâ€™s government records and a copy has to be submitted in court, he said. tnn
