CHENNAI: A   in   has been lying locked for four months as the   is waiting for a nod from the state government to inaugurate the facility. 

 Residents of the neighbourhood, located off the OMR-Pallavaram road, have made several appeals to the officials to let them use the park, but in vain. A few people used to go for walks in the park, when it was still being. But corporation officials locked it up and posted a security guard as it was not formally inaugurated. More than 4,000 residents will benefit from the facility which has a play area and a walking path.
 
  mostly has two to three storeyed flats and a good number of senior citizens. K R Surendran, president of Mars Welfare Association, said, “There is a small park nearby in R E Nagar, but it gets overcrowded. Youngsters and children need this open space to spend their vacation.”
 
 He also said that “if the park is kept unused, the money invested to build it will go waste. The government will have to spend more to maintain it. The work to build the park was on for one and a half years.”
 
 Chandra Sekar S, another resident said, “We feel that if the park is not utilised, it will be a waste of public money. There is no point in waiting for appointment of a senior officer or a politician to open a public facility.” 
 
 Six parks in the city were listed for inauguration in March. Five of them — in North C hennai — were inaugurated, whereas the Ananda Nagar Park, in south Chennai, is yet to be opened. Almost Rs 1 core has been invested in this park, sources said. 
 
 Senior official of Chennai corporation said: “The work has been completed and we have informed the state government. We are planning to open the park soon, mostly on the first week of June.”
