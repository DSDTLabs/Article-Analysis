The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) appellate   in New Delhi has set aside the 34 crore attachment order issued by the   (ED) in the Jagathi Publications aspect of the Disproportionate Assets case registered against YSR Congress president YS Jaganmohan  .

 In the Penna Cements case, the ED had modified the orders and in the Aurobindo case, it released the attachment amount subject to depositing of the secured amount.
 
 In the case against Jagathi Publications, the apellate tribunal observed, “After having gone through the chargesheet, even if the allegations are taken as correct in the predicate charge, no ‘schedule offence’ was prima facie committed for the purposes of PMLA. Therefore, the attachment is not sustainable in law.”
 
 In the Penna Cements case, it was alleged by the CBI and ED that the mining lease renewals, new leases and alienation of government land were allegedly granted to the group companies of P   and, as a quid pro quo, the industrialist had invested 45 crore in the Jagan companies. In 2015, the adjudicating authority confirmed the attachment order of 47 crore.
 
 But in this case, Jagan-owned Jagathi Publications, Janani Infrastructure, Carmel Asia Holdings and   appealed against the attachment orders. The ED then modified the orders and said that ?2.5 crore of Indira Television and ?6.9 crore of Janani Infrastructure were erroneous as the investments were made prior to 2006. Other attachments would continue, it said.
 
 In the Aurobindo case, the tribunal said: “Prima facie, it appears that if the allegations are taken as correct, it would be a case where the appellants paid a bribe of Rs 29.5 crore to obtain a benefit of Rs 21.5 crore, which is not practical.”
