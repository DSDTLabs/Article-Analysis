  According to documents from the Foreigners Regional Registration Office( ), Ifeayani was born in 1981 and came to Bengaluru in 2009 on a student visa. "His visa expired in 2012; documents recovered from his house show no proof of renewal," police said. 
 
  Even though there have been several controversies surrounding his death, the postmortem is yet to be done. Police said a letter has been sent to the Nigerian embassy to track down his family members in Africa and get a no-objection certificate and subsequent transfer of his body.
