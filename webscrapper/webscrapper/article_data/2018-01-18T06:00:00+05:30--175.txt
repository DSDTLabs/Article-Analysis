The two big   releases of the year,   and  , came under the   scanner on Wednesday. As the officials landed up at the office of producer   the rest of Tollywood went into a tizzy. Names started flying thick and fast as to who would be on the list next. It has emerged that offices of eight major Tollywood production houses were also searched. The officials however refused to comment on anything (till the time of going to press). “This is a routine IT search to check if the producers have complied with all the rules of TDS (Tax Deducted at Source). The search is still on so it’s early to comment whether we found anyone defaulting,” said a source from the department.
