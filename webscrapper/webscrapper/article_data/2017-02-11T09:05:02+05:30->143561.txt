 A second circular issued by the department of higher education to government, unaided and private colleges, directs all colleges to record an hour-long lecture of each professor, and to send the same to the department by February 15. The status of this order is still in question. “It’s unclear if this order is being implemented. We will have to check our records,” said Kusuma.
 
 According to the circular issued by the department, lecturers were to follow a uniform dress code and have identity badges. The circular triggered a series of meetings,even as professors and faculty members protested the dress code, citing gross violation of their rights.
 
 With the objective being to evaluate the quality of teaching, lecturers were shocked at the government’s decision to invest in video cameras, when many college buildings are devoid of even basic amenities.
