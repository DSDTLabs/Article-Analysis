DAVOS: Petroleum minister   has said that the Centre has done its bit to contain the rise in retail price of petrol and diesel, suggesting that states need to do their bit now, while seeking help from energy cartel   to keep global prices under check. “We have done our share,” Pradhan told TOI, adding that during his meetings with Saudi energy minister   and Russian energy minister   he will flag the issue of high global prices. “India is a consuming country and our consistent view is that global prices must be reasonable and responsible. Opec should look into it,” the minister said ahead of his meetings.

 Pradhan’s comments came amid reports that his ministry is seeking a further reduction in excise duty as on Wednesday, in Delhi, petrol and diesel prices touched a record high of 72.43 a litre and 63.38, respectively. Government officials indicated that the Centre was keen to ensure that its revenue was not impacted although it is under increasing pressure to lower pump prices of auto fuels.
 
 In October, the Centre had reduced excise duty by Rs 2 a litre but only a handful of states responded through a matching reduction in VAT.
 
 The minister also debunked criticism over adding 50% to the 247 million metric tonne refining capacity amid plans to shift to electric vehicles over the next few years. “This is a useless argument. It is complementary to electric vehicles. We need petroleum products too as the demand for aviation fuel will rise. We will have trucks and mining equipment, which will need fuel. Refining has a much bigger dimension, including exports, and it is complimentary to EVs,” Pradhan said. He said that capacity addition plan had been cleared and implementation had begun.
