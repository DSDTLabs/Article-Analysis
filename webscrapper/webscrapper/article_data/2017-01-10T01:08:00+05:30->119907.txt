 Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday postponed indefinitely the   of the party, which he had called on Sunday . 

 Reports said the decision was taken to avoid further embarrassment in case there was poor turnout to weaken Mulayam's claim that he continues to be the party's national president.
 
 Another reason cited for the cancellation was speculation that the move might be challenged by Akhilesh camp in the court. Sources said the Mulayam camp was already struggling to counter the embarrassment that came pout of poor attendance at the meeting of the national executive held on Sunday at MSY's residence, while the largely attended special   called by the Akhilesh camp was underway at the Janeshwar Misra park.
