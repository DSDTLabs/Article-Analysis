CHENNAI: Is the   hesitant about holding the   after the split in AIADMK, asked   working president   on Wednesday. Criticising the   government as well as the state election commission for "not honouring" the Madras high court order on holding local body elections before May 14, Stalin said doubts are being raised as to whether the AIADMK government is now afraid of holding the civic polls in the state. 

 "The state government extended the terms of special officers by citing Class 12 and Class 10 exams. But the high court asked the government to hold the elections before May 14. Still no preparatory work has been undertaken," said Stalin in a statement. "The SEC has to function in a free and fair manner. But the delay in holding of elections shows that its actions are illegal," Stalin said. "Is the SEC confused about allocation of the AIADMK symbol since there are two factions in that party? Is it the reason for the delay," he asked.
