BHUBANESWAR: BJD president and chief minister  's decision to support the NDA's presidential candidate   had many wondering whether an old political equation was getting a new makeover. But on Saturday, Naveen poured cold water to such speculations as he directed his MPs to aggressively counter the BJP-led central government in Parliament on matters which could be detrimental to the state's interests. 

 The BJD chief met the party MPs from both   and   to discuss the strategy for the monsoon session of Parliament scheduled to start from Monday and run till August 11.
 
 "Most of the MPs were confused about the BJD's political stand vis-Ã -vis the BJP on several issues. So, when an MP asked the chief minister about it, Naveen directed them to go on the offensive regarding all issues that could go against Odisha's interest," one of the parliamentarians, who attended the meeting, said on condition of anonymity.
 
 On June 20, the BJD's Dhenkanal MP,  , had taken potshots at the party in an editorial, saying that it doesn't have a political vision. This was after Naveen had given his support to Kovind's candidacy for the president's post. 
 
 On Saturday, the meeting lasted for nearly 45 minutes, where among others discussions were held on the recent newspaper articles, social media posts and media statements made by certain MPs on the BJD's internal matters, and which had created an embarrassment for the party.
