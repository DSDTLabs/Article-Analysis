NAGPUR: The new vice-chairman-cum-managing director (VC-MD) of   ( ),   plans to make   a livelier place. At present the SEZ and non-SEZ areas bear a rather desolate look, as only a handful of companies have started operations. 

 Interacting with newspersons during his visit to the MADC office here, Kakani said he plans to develop the two lakes in the area as recreational zones. The SEZ part of Mihan project has two lakes spread in an area of around 100 acres. Built as irrigation reservoirs, one of it is surrounded by the land allotted to erstwhile Satyam Computers, now Mahindra Satyam. Kakani said there are plans to have small eateries in the area too. This will help in bringing people to Mihan purely for visit and recreation. 
 
 The MADC is also focusing in bringing agro-based industries to the Mihan-SEZ. Units which may have warehouses to store semi-processed agricultural produce for exports will also be invited to Mihan, said Kakani. A proposal to reduce the minimum requirement of land in the non-SEZ part of the project is also being considered. It is planned to half the threshold limit to 2 acres. This is aimed to attract small investors to the area. Investors can already buy one acre plots within the SEZ.
 
 Kakani said apart from promoting business within the Mihan area, MADC is ready to facilitate projects outside too. This will help in creating a brand image of the region which needs an industrial push, he said.
 
 “We had promoted this model in Nanded where I was the collector, by bringing farmers together to form an association. MADC is ready to facilitate such ventures promoted by a group of people,” said Kakani. It will help in development of the region even outside the Mihan complex ultimately bringing progress to the region.
