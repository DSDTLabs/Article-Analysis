NEW DELHI: Days after chief minister   wrote to lieutenant governor   questioning his decision to get retired employees for the vacant posts in the state-run hospitals, the LG’s office has hit back saying it was the   that had proposed the move.

 Kejriwal had said that there were not enough retired personnel to fill up 2,169 posts lying vacant in the government-run hospitals. The chief minister had also said the decision to use the service of retired personnel was taken with Baijal’s approval while the elected government was kept in the dark about the decision.
 
 Reacting to the allegation, the LG’s office wrote on Thursday, “It is surprising that the Hon’ble   is questioning the decision to appoint retired employees against vacant posts as the proposal was moved by the health department in pursuance of directions of the Hon’ble CM only.” 
 
 The statement also pointed out the engagement of retired personnel was purely an interim measure to meet the shortage. “Regular recruitment alone is a sustainable solution for provision of quality healthcare services to the residents of Delhi. The vacancies in the government hospitals have been pending for a long time and he (the  ) had already got an action plan prepared to fill up vacancies not only in the health department but also in the entire Delhi government.” 
 
 According to the LG’s office, the chief secretary and the principal secretary (health and family welfare) have been instructed to personally monitor on a fortnightly basis the progress of filling up the vacancies.
 
 Government officials said the staff shortage was a major crisis faced by the state-run hospitals. “It is causing difficulty in running pharmacies, diagnostic services and even ICUs,” said a source.
