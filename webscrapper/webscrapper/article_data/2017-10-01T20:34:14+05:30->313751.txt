SEPANG:   finished a creditable sixth while   grabbed the last spot in the points bracket as   consolidated its fourth position following a good show at the  , on Sunday.

 The Indian team, by pocketing nine points from the race, now has 133 points with closest rival Williams at a distant 65.
 
 "It was probably the hardest race of my career, on a weekend in which I feared I would need to give up. It is an amazing result just to make it to the finish," Perez said after the race.
 
 "I just kept going out of willingness to do it and I have to thank the doctors for helping me out. Having a good start was the key to my race and so was passing Vandoorne during the first few laps. After that, I was able to manage my race and it was all pretty uneventful. We were able to extend the first stint and manage our tyres well."
 
 However, Ocon was not a happy man after the race.
 
 "It was a disappointing race. The contact on lap one [in turn two] with Massa gave me a puncture and ruined my race. I had to pit on lap two and drive almost the entire race on one set of soft tyres. When you consider the condition of the tyres at the end of the race, we did well to score the final point," he said.
