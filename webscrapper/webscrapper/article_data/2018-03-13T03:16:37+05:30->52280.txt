MUMBAI: A   on Monday directed that   politician  , who is in jail pending trial, be allowed to undergo some   at the GS Sheth Medical College. 

 Bhujbal has been in jail since March 2016 after his arrest in the Rs 870 crore Maharashtra Sadan scam. He was taken to the JJ   after it was suspected that he was suffering from an acute attack of pancreatitis. Doctors at JJ said Bhujbal would be discharged on Tuesday morning.
 
 “JJ doesn’t have a hepatobiliary department and hence needs to consult doctors at KEM Hospital that have the specialization. His condition is stable now,” said a senior doctor, adding that the former deputy chief minister was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. tnn
