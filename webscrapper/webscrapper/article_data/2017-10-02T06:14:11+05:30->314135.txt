New Delhi: A 60-year-old   was found   in a godown in outer Delhi’s   on Sunday. The body was found by a nearby shop owner. Police said the man was smothered in what appeared to be a robbery attempt gone wrong.

 “Prima facie, it appears that the man was smothered. We have not ruled out the possibility of this being a case of robbery,” said Pankaj Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police. They suspect the involvement of a gang involved in several burglaries in the area. 
 
 The victim, Bajran Singh, hailed from Rajasthan. Police said while there were no visible injury marks on the body, they were waiting for the autopsy report. “The post-mortem will be conducted on Monday,” Singh said.
 
 A man who runs a paan kiosk near the godown found the guard lying unconscious and informed the police. The guard was rushed to hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. A case of murder was registered at Mundka police station. The pan seller said when Singh, a regular to his shop, didn’t turn up on Sunday morning, he decided to check on him. He found him tied with a rope.
 
 Police said they were analysing   footage for clues. They haven’t ruled out personal enmity as a motive. Singh had been working at the godown for 11 months.
