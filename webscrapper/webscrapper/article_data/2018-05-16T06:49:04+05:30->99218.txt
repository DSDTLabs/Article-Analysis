 The Congress accused the   of a working with a skewed sense of inclusive development. The Congress questioned why the AMC turned a blind eye to the construction of a six-storey illegal building at Pakwan Crossroads on SG Road that was being built without parking or margin space.
 
 “The AMC town planning and estate departments clearly buckled under political pressure to allow such blatant violation,” said opposition leader  .
 
 “A show-cause and then a demolition order were issued. Yet no action was taken for two months. It was brought to the notice of the high court last week.”
 
 He asked why the town planning officer was not being questioned for not producing progress report on the illegal construction. Sharma went on to say: “It does not take AMC a second to pull down buildings of poor people. Why this partisan attitude?”
