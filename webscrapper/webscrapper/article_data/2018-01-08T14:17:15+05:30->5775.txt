KOCHI: Doctors of Government Medical College, Ernakulam, are taking a mass casual leave on January 9 demanding implementation of the integration process, which started almost four years ago. 

 "We have given notice to the principal stating that only   will be on duty and the rest are taking casual leave," said Dr   G, secretary, cooperative medical college teachers association ( ).
 
 In a letter issued to the college authorities, they said that the association had withdrawn a strike notice issued on October 5, 2017 following an intervention from the health minister's office. "Unfortunately nothing positive had come out since then as regards our present status and terms of integration into directorate of medical education (DME). Therefore, the general body of CMCTA have decided to go on a one-day strike on Januray 9. All academic and clinical works except emergencies will be suspended on that day," they said in the notice.
 
 Dr Unnikrishnan said that at present the government is proposing that all assistant professors, lecturers and those below that cadre in teaching circles will be integrated into DME by counting 2013 as the year of joining. "There are several people who have been teaching for the past 10 years and they would end up losing all that experience. Imagine they would be getting into the same scale as their students, some of whom have joined as teachers after studying here itself," he said.
 
 As for the status of the associate professor and above, the government said that they won't be taken into the mainstream jobs but would not lose their jobs. "What it means will have to be seen," he said.
 
 "At present, the financial implications indicate that they would be   than what they are earning now," the association said.
