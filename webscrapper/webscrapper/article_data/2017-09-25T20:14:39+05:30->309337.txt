Bijnor: At least 2,600 veterinarians across Uttar Pradesh on Monday went on a statewide strike to press for non-practice allowance (NPA) like their counterparts in neighbouring states like Uttarakhand. Before the BJP came to power in UP, these veterinary doctors were allowed private practice but after the formation of the new government in March, the practice is being discouraged       On Monday, some 2,000 of the 2,600 government vets assembled in Lucknow at Laxman Ground and staged a dharna there to press for their demand for NPA. They said they would boycott work for an indefinite period till their demand is met.        Explaining the plight of vets, UP Veterinary Association’s general secretary Anil Kumar said they too want NPA like their counterparts in Uttarakhand, Haryana, Himachal, Punjab, Delhi and other states who get NPA ranging from 20 to 25% of their salary. “We have been raising our demands for the past 25 years here in the state and talks in this regard have also taken place. In 2016, the central government had instructed states to pay NPA to all vets where NPA is not given. The previous government had started the process of allowing NPA for us but unfortunately, it could not move forward.”        Earlier, UP Veterinary Association had boycotted a vaccination drive of 4.76 crore livestock in the state for foot and mouth (FMD) disease that was to be launched from September 16. Now, they have decided to completely stop treating all livestock. The decision has not only affected dairy farming in the state but the entire business of slaughtering animals. Now, slaughter houses will not be able to carry out any slaughtering of cattle, goat or sheep as vets will not issue any medical reports.        This is the first time that vets have boycotted not only the vaccination drive but also refused to treat livestock till their demands are met.        Citing the provision that allows vets not getting NPA to undertake private practice after discharging their official duties, Kumar pointed out that even this is not very useful. He said when vets make house calls in farms post-duty hours to tend to sick cattle, farmers ask why they are being charged for treatment of cattle and medicine by government doctors. Besides, vets sometimes have to bear conveyance expenses and shell out money for medicines from their own pocket.    Kumar admitted that meat exports will be hit because of “our strike as no cattle can be slaughtered without getting our certificate”.    When contacted, owner of Umar International meat plant at Sahaspur Haji Idrish said, “ I am not aware about the strike. Its impact will surface on Tuesday. It is right that if vets do not issue health certificate of cattle to us, it will affect slaughtering in the district.”    Farmers and livestock owners are worried because in the absence of vaccination of their animals, they may fall prey to foot and mouth disease and other diseases.    Nrapendra Deshwal, a farmer of Nawad village, said, “Farmers are in a dilemma. They do not know what to do as the vets have refused to vaccinate or treat our cattle. It is the prime time for the vaccination of the cattle as winter is round the corner. If our cattle are not vaccinated, they can fall sick.”
