Chandigarh: Yet another inspection has called for better facilities at Chandigarh  . In a check carried out on Friday, a team headed by Northern Railways chief commercial manager (freight marketing) Om Parkash Chaudhary said the station required better facilities on all platforms and inside waiting rooms.

 The team, a station improvement group (SIG), instructed officials of the railways’ Ambala division, which manages the station here, to have better managed parking lots on the Panchkula side, to speed up the installation of high-resolution CCTV cameras and ceiling fans at platforms, and to ensure cleanliness near escalators. The only saving grace for the station, which aspires to be a world-class facility, was that drinking water supplied on all platforms and food at snack shops were found to be of “satisfactory quality”. Chaudhary said the samples were found to be fit for consumption.
 
 The inspection lasted two hours. 
 
 Chaudhary said they had issued instructions to officials to upgrade amenities at the station. The team also inspected the Panchkula side of the station. 
 
 The team suggested that instead of ceiling fans, the division should install fans on the pillars of platforms for passengers. It also found ceiling fans in the upper-class waiting room and for staff near the tick counter insufficient.
 
 The team also suggested to the division to hire a new contractor for cleaning up areas near escalators at the station. 
 
 The team also directed officials of the division to check the railways’ policy on installing air-conditioners and have the facility for staff at the counter. Till time the ACs are not installed, the division has been asked to install “big fans”. Chaudhary said they would soon hold a review meeting to know the progress of works. 
 
 As per railway norms, the station improvement group, a team of which visited Chandigarh railway station on Friday, has to carry out inspections at a location after every three months.
