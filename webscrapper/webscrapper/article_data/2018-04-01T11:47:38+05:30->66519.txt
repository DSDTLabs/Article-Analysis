CHARMINAR:  , 70, was abandoned by his family 18 years ago. For years he wandered the streets before taking refuge in a mosque. He was only able to relax when he was shifted to  , a home for the destitute near Shivrampally.

 “I was abandoned by my own children. My life was terrible before I was shifted here,” said Khaisar, who slowly overcame depression with the help of caretakers and medical experts at Aramghar.
 
 Khaisar’s story is echoed in almost all the inmates of the home. And while Aramghar has succeeded in providing succour to many abandoned people, the home itself is in need of help.
 
 The state government used to give a grant of ?1 lakh every year, but they stopped since 2004-05, said officials. “Though we have donors coming forward to support us, regular funding from the government is the need of the hour,” said B S  , executive officer of Aramghar.
 
 Established in 1954 and managed by the Indian Council for Social Welfare, Aramghar has around 50 inmates in the women’s ward and 45 in the men’s ward. Many of them are mentally ill. The funds from donors only cover the cost of food and medical care.
 
 “The building is in dilapidated state and cracks are visible in the walls. We need funds to fix these problems,” Raju said. The government seems to have turned a blind eye to the home even as the police continue to bring the destitute men and women they find on the streets to the shelter.
