NEW DELHI: In a reversal of stand, the   on Thursday told Delhi high court it has no plans to   begging in the capital.

 The government, which had earlier informed the court that the   had drafted a bill to decriminalise begging and rehabilitate beggars and homeless people, said that government has now dropped the proposal to amend the legislation.
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar noted termed the changed stand “unfortunate” and noted that the Centre took “one year time to produce this draft bill. We are only concerned with Delhi and not the legislation as a whole.”
 
 Centre maintained it has no Act on begging, adding states are free to frame their own laws.
 
 But the bench pointed out that the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act was extended to Delhi by a central government amendment and Delhi government cannot bring any notification on its own to remove it.
 
 The court noted in its order that while the Centre had earlier said it was proposing an Act to decriminalise begging, the Union of India has now taken a view that it will not decriminalise begging.
 
 “In fact that day, the Centre's counsel had given an undertaking to bring the draft proposal,” the bench said and listed the matter for hearing arguments on November 14.
 
 The court is hearing two PILs seeking basic human and fundamental rights for beggars in the capital and for decriminalising begging.
 
 The Centre and the AAP government had in October last year informed the court that the Ministry of Social Justice had drafted a bill to decriminalise begging and rehabilitate beggars and homeless people.
 
 The court had directed the ministry to place on record a copy of the draft legislation - The Persons in Destitution (Protection, Care and Rehabilitation) Model Bill, 2016.
