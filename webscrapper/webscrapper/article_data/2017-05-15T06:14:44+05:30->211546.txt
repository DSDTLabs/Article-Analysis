DEHRADUN: A former   was caught on Sunday with 18 kg of explosives in Chamoli district of Garhwal. Police officials said the recovered substance is a ‘class II explosive’ containing gelatin and is generally used in road construction activities in the hills. The accused is believed to have been involved in smuggling the explosives and was intending to sell it to someone.
 
  Satyapal Singh, an ex-Armyman of the rank of subedar and a resident of Gopeshwar, was arrested with 45 sticks of gelatin. According to the superintendent of police (SP), Chamoli, Tripti Bhatt, more arrests in the matter may also be made. The role of officials involved in road construction activities in border areas is also being investigated. A case was filed against   in the   police station under the Explosives Act.
  
  “We had intelligence inputs about a person planning to smuggle explosives in the area. We are interrogating him for further leads in the incident,” said Bhatt.
  
  While ruling out any terror angle in the matter, especially when the   yatra is going on, Bhatt said, “The explosives were not meant for any anti-national activity. Gelatin rods are generally used to blast stones and quarrying activities at construction sites.”
  
  More than one lakh pilgrims have visited the Badrinath shrine in Chamoli district since portals of the temple opened on May 6.
  
  Cops also suspect that the highly-volatile explosive material was either stolen from agencies involved in construction activities or systematically leaked in connivance with those undergoing road-building in the area.
  
  Ram  , additional director general of police (law and order) said, “The accused said that another person had given him the gelatin rods for storage. We are now trying to ascertain the identity of this man.”
