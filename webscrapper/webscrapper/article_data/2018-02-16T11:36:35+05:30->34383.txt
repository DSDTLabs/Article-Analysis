HYDERABAD: A fatwa by the 134-year-old Daful  , an Islamic seminary in Hyderabad, says the song 'Manikya malarayi poovi' from the Malayalam film 'Oru Adaar Love' should be removed and the government should ensure that the film does not get released without removing it. 

 The song features 18-year-old Priya Varrier, who has become a national rage after a teaser was released. The film is directed by  , who has defended the use of the song in the film, saying there was no scope in it to hurt religious sentiments.
 
 Zaheer Ali Khan, a local resident of   approached the seminary with a question to which the seminary gave a reply on Thursday. He brought to the notice of scholars about the song which has references to the Prophet and his wife Khadeeja Bibi.
 
 While this song is being played in the background, Priya Prakash Varrier gives out several expressions, including winking and raising her eyebrows - which caught the fancy of the nation but landed the film in a controversy. 
 
 A police complaint was lodged with the Falaknuma police on February 14 and is being investigated, if the song hurts the sentiments of the Muslim community, as alleged. The Jamia Nizamia, which gave a reply to Khan on the song, said it should be removed from the film. The objection is on the use of the song's lyrics itself. From the fatwa, it is clear that the objection is not about the picturisation of the song but the very use of the song and the lyrics.
 
 The filmmakers have maintained that the song is sung by the Muslim community in traditional functions in Kerala and have expressed surprise over the controversy that it has landed in. "Since this is the fatwa from the seminary, it should be honoured by the filmmaker," said  , who earlier lodged a police complaint, taking strong exception to the picturisation of the song.
