CHANDIGARH: The Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) of India has pointed out that jails in   are short of over 50% arms and ammunition than their requirements.

 In its recent report, tabled in the state assembly, CAG observed that shortage of weapons in jails was bound to have an adverse impact on the security. It has also found that most of the walkie-talkie systems purchased by jail authorities for better internal communication and monitoring have become non-functional.
 
 
  
 
 These findings of CAG are based on appraisal of security arrangements in selected eight jails of the state. The report has stated that the   prescribes that every warder shall be provided with military breach loading firearms and buckshot ammunition. According to the manual, 50 rounds blank and 30 round of buckshot were to be allotted to individual officials.
 
 “Ammunition for deputy superintendents, senior assistant superintendents, assistant superintendents of jail was to be provided on the scale allowed for warders. But during checking, huge shortage of pistols, revolvers, guns, rifles and ammunition was found as on April 30, 2017. Jail administration has only 21 pistols/revolvers as against the required 72. Similarly rifles/ guns were also found to be 841 against the requirement of 1,368,” CAG has reported.
 
 In its defence, Haryana DGP (jails) claimed that norms of arms and ammunition were on higher side in the Punjab Jail Manual. CAG, however, refused to accept DGP’s explanation on the ground that norms prescribed by the jail manual have to be followed till they are not amended or replaced by new manual.
 
 CAG has also found that out of 220 existing security equipment, including mobile phone jammers, door framed metal detectors, hand held metal detector and search lights, 151were non-functional.
