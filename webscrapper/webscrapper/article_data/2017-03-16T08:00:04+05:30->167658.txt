AMRITSAR: An unclaimed briefcase found in the parking area of   here on Wednesday, apparently forgotten behind by a passenger, triggered a security scare. A Punjab Police team, CISF sleuths and a bomb disposal squad cordoned off the area and worked for nearly five hours to ‘difuse’ the bomb. 

 The scare came barely hours after an intelligence input about terror attack at the Pathankot Air Force base had led to a search operation of the airbase and its vicinity.
 
 Amritsar airport director Venkateshwar Rao told TOI that an unidentified briefcase was spotted by the security staff at 9am. When no one picked it up for some time, CISF personnel cordoned off the area and called in a sniffer dogs team and bomb detection and disposal squad. Amritsar commissioner of police Nageshwar Rao said when one of the three dogs on the job acted as if the briefcase containing some explosive, the whole area was cordoned off. He said that on opening it, nothing objectionable was found inside. The case contained personal belongings only.
 
 According to sources, a passenger (name not disclosed) had arrived from Birmingham on board a Turkmenistan Airlines flight and left for another destination after ‘accidentally’ leaving his briefcase at the parking area of the airport.
 
 Stating that it was a case of carelessness, Rao said police verified his antecedents and the contents of the bag before letting him off. The airport director stated that during the entire episode the daily operations were not suspended. “Not even a single flight was delayed or diverted or any operation suspended,” he maintained.
 
 Meanwhile, Pathankot SSP Nilambari Jagdalay said that the police didn’t find anything suspicious or any person during the search of the IAF station and its surrounding areas. “After receiving the intelligence input, the search operation was carried out as a preventive measure,” she added.
