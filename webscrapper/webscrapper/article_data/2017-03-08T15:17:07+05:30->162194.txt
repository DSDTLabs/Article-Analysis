 is producing her upcoming film ‘Phillauri’ with her brother   and the two are now setting new benchmarks in filmmaking. Looks like the brother-sister duo who hit the bull’s eye with their maiden venture ‘NH10’ are on a roll. They got a beautiful surprise on the sets of the film before the wrap-up when their parents arrived on the last day to hang out with them. Anushka’s father is from the defence background and he and his wife have never been associated with the glamour world. However, it was definitely a proud moment for the Sharmas to see their kids working together. 

 The actress who plays a ghost in her home production, is making all the right noise ahead of its release on March 24.
