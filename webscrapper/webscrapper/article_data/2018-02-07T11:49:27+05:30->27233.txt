Trichy: Functionaries of farming bodies have decided to besiege   in Delhi on February 23, demanding to write off entire crop loan and other related debts of the farming community borrowed from both nationalised banks as well as cooperative banks. Meanwhile, members of   staged a protest pressing the state and   to fix profitable price for agricultural produce.

 At a consultation meeting held here on Tuesday, members of the federations of 69 farmer’s bodies from across the country participated, where various resolutions were adopted. They have also decided to mobilise thousands of farmers from across the country and stage a protest in Delhi on February 23.
 
 While elaborating on the protest, state president of Desiya Thenninthiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam P Ayyakannu said that the much-expected announcement on writing off of farmers’ debt did not exist. Nothing was favourable for the farmers in the   budget too, he alleged.
 
 Meanwhile, at the protest held at   near Anna statue in the city, members of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam raised slogans of their demands. As farming activities are largely dependent on pump sets, it is the need of the hour to provide power connection to all the farmers, who are in waiting list for years to get power connection across the state, another resolution stated. The Tangedco should work accordingly so that all waiting farmers get the connection before March 31 of this year.
 
 All loans of the farming community should be written off by both the state and the central government immediately. Required action should be taken to ensure farmers get profitable price for their produce, based on market fluctuations, they urged. N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharathiya Kisan Sangam and other functionaries participated.
