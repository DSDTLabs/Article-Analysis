HYDERABAD: If everything goes as per plan, about 10 new municipalities will come up around Hyderabad including Pragathinagar, Poppalguda, Komapally, Bollaram, Ameenpur, Tellapur, Kollur and Turkayamjal. Municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao held a meeting with collectors of Ranga Reddy, Medchal and   districts, the municipal administration and panchayat raj departments along with people’s representatives of the districts on Monday and discussed the issue.

 The state government has already decided to upgrade major gram panchayats to municipalities especially within the   (ORR). Some panchayats will be merged with   (GHMC) to enable regulated and planned growth in Hyderabad Metropolitan Region.
 
 Some MLAs and MPs who took part in the meeting expressed concern that people may oppose either conversion into new municipalities or merger with GHMC as this may lead to increase in property taxes and other taxes. They even reminded how when there was a proposal to merge 36 panchayats, people opposed the move and government had to withdraw the proposal.
 
 The state government has taken the decision to convert panchayats with a population above 15,000. “There will be no hike in taxes for two years after formation of new municipalities and government would provide adequate funds for civic bodies,” the minister said.
 
 Officials said there are 167 villages within ORR. KTR asked collectors to coordinate with local MLAs and MPs on new municipalities.
