SHIMLA: Hundreds of patients across Himachal Pradesh were left lurching and annoyed on Monday as there were no doctors to attend them. Around 2,000 doctors from across the state have gone on indefinite period strike, following their sullenness with the state government after death of a doctor.

 Patients were seen roaming in the premises of government hospitals on Monday and many serious patients had to suffer in the absence of doctors. Shimla resident doctors’ association too has joined the protest and around 300 doctors of   and Hospital (IGMCH) too were on leave. The situation will get worse if the strike is not rolled back at the earliest.
 
 Panthaghati resident   said he got sudden problem in stomach on Saturday evening but had to wait till Monday to meet doctor, but now there are no doctors at IGMCH. Kullu resident Meena said she brought her daughter to Shimla on Friday expecting better treatment and got appointment for Monday. “But, my daughter is miserable as her treatment has delayed now and nobody knows when the doctors will be available again,” she added. Another patient from Malyana, Reenu Mahajan, said being poor she cannot afford to go in a private hospital but now her treatment has stopped due to the strike.
 
 Doctors have gone on collective strike due to a doctor’s death in Una few days after he was humiliated by some influential people in the hospital, for which they have demanded enquiry and justice. The doctors have even demanded state health minister Kaul Singh Thakur’s resignation after he stated that small incidences keep occurring.
 
 IGMCH senior medical superintendent Dr Ramesh Chand said they faced problem as there were no doctors in OPD. Though, senior doctors handled emergency cases on Monday and many operations too were conducted. “As people were already aware about the strike, comparatively less patients arrived on Monday,” he added.
