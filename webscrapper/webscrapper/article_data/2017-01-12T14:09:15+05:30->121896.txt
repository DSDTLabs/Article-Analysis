  Dheeraj's friends and family who have seen the film have also appreciated Dheeraj's performance a lot. It is very unlike what people are used to seeing of him.
  
  Dheeraj said, "Amber( director ) is a dear friend & when he discussed the plot of the film with me I was excited to be a part of it because I loved the story and there is a social message in it. It's been shot very well & I hope it sends out a powerful message. I respect women with all my heart but at the same time I do believe that it's not just the men who are bad and also share the other side of the story. Waiting for reviews have my fingers crossed".
