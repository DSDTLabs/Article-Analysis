Bicholim: Residents of Bicholim and Sakhali have demanded that the government repair the Bicholim-Sakhali stretch of National Highway 17. They claim that the innumerable potholes have made it difficult for motorists to navigate the area. The left portion of the Bicholim-Sakhali NH 17 was totally washed away following the onset of the monsoon. Large potholes in the middle of the road, and especially towards the left side, have resulted in most vehicles travelling in the wrong lane bid to avoid the bumps. This, in turn, has increased the possibility of serious accidents.  Villagers have now demanded that the stretch of road be repaired immediately, on a temporary basis. “The contractor must have not used a second coating of tar while carpeting the road. As a result of this, a part of it has been totally washed away,” said Praveen Teli, a local resident. “Most vehicles use the wrong lane in order to avoid potholes, consequently leading to accidents,” said Nandu Naik, an office-goer who regularly uses the route to travel to work.
