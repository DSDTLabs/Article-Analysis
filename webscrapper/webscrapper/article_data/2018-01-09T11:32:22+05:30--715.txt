GUWAHATI:  , a woman who runs a children's shelter in  , is now in a race against time to include the children under her care in the second draft of the   (NRC). There are 21 inmates at Pradhan's 'Mission Concern' - who have been orphaned or abandoned. Pradhan says she could not grasp the technicalities as to how to go about registering orphans in the first draft of the   but has now set target on passing on her legacy to six children at her shelter who have no parents. 

 Speaking to TOI, an NRC official from Diphu said the updating process has an institutional category that allows orphaned children to be given the legacy of the head of the institution where they stay, provided that the institution is recognized. In November last year, Pradhan's 'Mission Concern' was registered as a childcare institute under the   Justice Act. 
 
 The NRC official said, "In the first NRC, she didn't apply the names of her adopted children. We have spoken to her and she has said she will apply for inclusion of the names of her adopted children in the second draft of the NRC. The children will get the legacy of Pradhan since she is the head of the adopted home."
 
 As per locals, Pradhan's 'Mission Concern' is the only childcare institute in Karbi Anglong.
 
 "I want to include as many names as possible. But I am particularly focused on the six children who are fully orphaned. As for the others who were abandoned or given up by their single parent, I will try to find if there are any existing relatives. Let's see what happens but I want to put in all the names," said Pradhan.
