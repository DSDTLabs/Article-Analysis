 “Arpit was the first choice for this role. However, the role required an actor with a height crossing 6 feet 2 inches. Though Arpit sailed through audition and look test, this last minute requirement made him lose the role. Nirbhay Wadhwa, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall, got the role after the last minute audition. The decision was taken by Ekta,” said a source associated with the show on the condition of anonymity.
 The show will also feature   and   in lead roles.
