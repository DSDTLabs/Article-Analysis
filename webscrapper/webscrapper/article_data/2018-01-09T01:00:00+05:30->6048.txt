PATNA: Union minister of state for human resource department (HRD) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) national president   on Monday upped the ante on the Centre by demanding the details of the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC 2011), including that related to Bihar.

 Addressing his party’s function here, Kushwaha said the Centre should put the SECC details in public domain as people of the state have been making the demand in this regard for some time past.
 
 Incidentally, before the 2014 parliamentary elections and also on the eve of the assembly elections next year, RJD president Lalu Prasad had raked up the issue and also demanded that its details should be made public.
 
 Incidentally, in the backdrop of Lalu’s conviction by the CBI court in the fodder scam, Kushwaha said, “Lalu has now become a history.” 
 
 Kushwaha said media persons had always wanted to know his opinion and stand on Lalu. “Today, I say that he (Lalu) has become history,” he reiterated.
 
 However, Kushwaha mourned Lalu’s only sister Gangotri Devi (73) who died on Sunday after hearing that her brother had been awarded a long jail term. 
 
 However, he advised Lalu’s younger son and leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, to prepare for the legal battle properly. Tejashwi would have a long round of legal battle, even in the future, he said.
 
 Kushwaha, at the same time, demanded reservation in the judiciary for the scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), other backward classes (OBC) and women. Incidentally, the JD(U) has also been demanding it and, in fact, reiterated it on Sunday.
 
 Kushwaha said the country had 17,000 judges of whom 4,500 were women. However, the presence of the judges from the SC, ST and OBC categories was minuscule, he added.
