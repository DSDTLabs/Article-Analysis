CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu Electricity Board ( ) has cancelled the contract given to   Infratech Ltd for setting up a 660MW thermal unit in Ennore. The work order was issued to Lanco in 2014 by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa after the company won the bid. The project was to be commissioned in January this year. The project was stuck because of Lanco’s financial problems. Since August last year, Lanco’s insolvency case is pending with the   (NCLT). 

 
  
 
 “The board has cancelled the contract worth Rs 3,960cr as the company is in a financial mess and the work has not progressed beyond 20%. About 85% of the foundation, construction of power house building and seawater intake pump house have been completed,” a senior   official told TOI.
 
 Once a new contractor is identified through a re-tender, it would take three more years for the project to be completed.
 
 Unlike other thermal units which got stuck in court cases, Ennore expansion project was allotted to Lanco soon after the bids were opened for the project. “The company was given the EPC contract and we received loan from   to fund the thermal unit,” said the official.
 
 Other thermal projects like Ennore special economic zone (SEZ) and North Thermal 800MW unit are also likely to be delayed by at least two more years.
 
 “Unlike 2012-13, when the state was dependent on new thermal units for managing power shortage, the situation is better now. In the next one month, we will have wind power generation and that will take care of power supply till September. But if demand increases beyond 15,500MW, we would need all these new projects to generate power,” said the official.
