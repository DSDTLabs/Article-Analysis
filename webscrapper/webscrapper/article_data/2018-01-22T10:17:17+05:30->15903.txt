BENGALURU: A 48-year-old businessman was found murdered at his residence in Panchasheelanagar, Moodalapalya, near Vijayanagar, west Bengaluru, on Saturday night. 

 Vijayanagar police suspect Ganesh, a used vehicle dealer and real estate agent, was killed on Thursday night as the body had decomposed. M N Anucheth, deputy commissioner of police (west division) said the incident came to light when Ganesh's wife Uma returned from   on Saturday night. "We have taken up a   based on the complaint lodged by his wife. We have collected   footage from areas nearby and are verifying them for clues about the killers," he said. 
 
 "At 6pm on Thursday, my husband dropped me and my son, an undergraduate student, at the bus stand. On reaching my parents' home in Shivamogga, I called my  , but he did not take the call," she said in her statement to police.
 
 Vijaynagar cops said Ganesh had told his wife that he'd be visiting Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh for a property deal. 
 
  Uma thought her husband might be busy and, hence, wasn't responding to her calls. However, Ganesh remained unreachable on Saturday too. When Uma reached home, she found the door was locked from outside. She opened it only to find the decomposed body of her husband. 
 
  Police said Ganesh had at least eight injuries on his chest,   and suspect the assailants might have used a machete to attack him. They suspect business rivalry or financial disputes could have led to the brutal murder.
