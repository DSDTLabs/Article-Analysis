PANAJI: The   is awaiting reports from   on the location of  , after which it will commence issuing notices to those located within 500 m of the outer edge of national and state highways, as per the Supreme Court’s order.

 The committees deadline to complete the survey and submit their reports ends on Tuesday.
 
 As per a rough estimate, 2,500-3,000 alcohol shops are likely to be affected.
 
 “We expect to receive the reports on Tuesday,” said excise commissioner Menino D’Sousa, and added that notices will intimate that the licence of the respective outlets will not be renewed as per the apex court’s directive.
 
 Liquor licences are renewed annually and those who fail to renew them before April 1 do so at a later date by paying a late fee. “We don’t want that to happen,” said D’Souza explaining that, anyway, as per the order, licenses of all outlets within 500m of highways will be cancelled.
 
 As per the apex court directive, states and Union territories have to also remove all hoardings and advertisements for sale of liquor installed within 500m of national and state highways.
 
 In this regard, D’Souza said the department has already asked the directorate of municipal administration and directorate of panchayats to submit reports. Action will be taken once the reports are received, he added.
 
 D’Souza said they are yet to hear from the government as to whether the apex court could be approached seeking review of the order, as many families will be affected by the order.
 
 Opposition leader   said his party will raise the issue on the floor of the assembly on Tuesday.
