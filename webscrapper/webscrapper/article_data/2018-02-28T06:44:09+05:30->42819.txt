AHMEDABAD: Breaking his silence after the Gujarat assembly polls, Patidar quota leader   on Tuesday said that the ruling   and the opposition   are the same when it comes to injustice to Patidars. In a statement, Hardik said that the Patel community had made the Congress a strong opposition, but the leader of the opposition in the state assembly,  , has not spoken a single word on the atrocities against Patidars during the quota agitation in August 2015.

 “Dhanani speaks a lot about other issues but why is he silent about the death of 14 Patidars, and about reservations?” Hardik told TOI. “What does it mean if they (BJP and Congress) have come together? Should we fight against both the forces now?”
 
 Hardik also circulated a message questioning the Congress’ intention. “The state assembly has been in session for the past five days. The self-immolation by a Dalit activist is being raised aggressively and repeatedly,” the message read. “The issue of a Dalit man’s self-immolation must be raised. But not a single   is saying anything about the atrocities against Patidars or about the false cases of sedition slapped on Patel leaders. Even Dhanani is silent.”
 
 Hardik’s message goes on to say: “If the Congress wants to remain silent over these issues, I feel that both the Congress and the BJP are on the same pedestal. Our community had felt that a young leader like Dhanani would speak on public issues, but it seems that people’s trust on him will vanish soon.” 
 
 When asked if he would join politics, he said, “Let me attain the minimum age of 25, then I will decide further course of action.” Earlier on Tuesday, he had told reporters that he would join electoral politics to champion the causes of common people.
