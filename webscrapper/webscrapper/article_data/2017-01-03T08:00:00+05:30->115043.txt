JAIPUR: The long serpentine queues outside the bank counters may have reduced, but bank officials believe that   situation is unlikely to improve any time soon.

 “A branch that needs Rs 1 crore is getting around Rs 40 to 50 lakh for one week, this discrepancy is leading to another kind of demand-supply problems for banks. We have to cater to huge number of salary class and pensioners from a limited pool of money,” added a bank manager on the condition of anonymity.
 
 Officials also blamed   crunch on lack of small denominations notes of Rs 500 and Rs 100. “Notes of Rs 2,000 are in glut, but there are hardly any notes of Rs 500 or Rs 100 in banks. People withdraw Rs 2,000 from ATMs and rush to bank counters to convert the high currency note into coins,” official said.
 
 GL Manawat, a senior bank official told TOI that ‘banking rotations’ at big branches have improved the cash problem at least for big branches. “We have accounts of big customers who deposit sufficient amount in our bank on regular basis, thus, banks like ours have been largely immune to the problem as we distribute the deposited amount among our customers,” he added.
 
 Several officials like Manawat told TOI that importance should be given on the distribution of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 100. “The currency notes of Rs 2,000 are not getting circulated and are least popular among people. Rather than spending it, people are hoarding the notes of Rs 2,000. The notes of these denominations are returning back to the banks,” added another official. 
 
 The bank managers added that the situation is expected to return to normalcy in next two to three months. “If the limit to withdraw cash from credit account is increased, then we would see significant improvement in the situation, also the cash withdraw limit of Rs 4,500 should also be increased,” an official said.
