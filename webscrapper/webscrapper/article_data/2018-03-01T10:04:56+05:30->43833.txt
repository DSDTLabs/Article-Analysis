HYDERABAD: In spite of   announcing a ban on all private vehicles on its arterial road from Tuesday, and placing banners at various points,   members on Wednesday said that this was not enough and demanded that the varsity immediately appoints security guards so that no outside vehicles enter campus. 

 They claimed that on average about 10-12 accidents a month take place inside the campus because of rash driving and said that ban on the entry of private vehicles is the only way to protect students.
 
 "Lately, varsity roads are turning into race tracks for bikers and their rash driving is in turn injuring students. Also the movement of private vehicles has been upsetting the environment in the varsity. We want authorities to immediately erect gates and put guards permanently near the gates," said P Srihari, in charge of ABVP-OU unit, adding that the guards should check identity cards and should only send students with valid IDs inside the campus.
 
 However, the decision to close down arterial road to private vehicles has not gone down well with daily commuters. They said that the varsity has no business to close down roads, which people have been using for years now.
 
 "First, the Army and now the Osmania University. They can't just close down the roads which are built with public money. There is no problem if they ban the movement of heavy vehicles, but they should not be blocking two-wheelers and cars," said   P, a daily commuter.
 
 "The Osmania University has decided to ban the entry of all private vehicles round the clock on the main arterial road running through the campus following a spate of fatal accidents and near misses," read the statement issued on behalf of registrar Ch Gopal Reddy.
