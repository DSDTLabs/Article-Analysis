CHENNAI: Former Union minister   and his brother   on Saturday said the entire ‘telephone exchange’ case had been foisted against them due to lack of basic technical understanding by   officials.

 “The allegation that there were 700 telephone lines was wrong. As telecom minister, only 10 lines were provided to Dayanidhi Maran’s residence, originally at  , later in Boat Club area. The CBI had failed to understand the latest technology. If they had understood, they would not have pursued this case,” they said while seeking the court to discharge them from the case.
 
 Senior counsel Kapil Sibal and A R L Sundresh represented the Maran brothers and other accused in the case.
 
 Recording the submissions, the special CBI court posted the plea to February 8 for the CBI to submit their contentions. According to the CBI, Dayanidhi Maran, during the check period from June 2004 to December 2006 when he was the Union minister for communications and information technology, misused his office and installed a private telephone exchange at his residences in Chennai and utilised the facility for business transactions involving Sun Network.
 
 It said he had caused a loss of Rs 1.78 crore to the exchequer. More than 700 telecom lines had been installed at their residences in Boat Club and Gopalapuram in Chennai, the agency charged.
