SRINAGAR: The family of  's research scholar   on Tuesday urged him to give up arms and return to the mainstream. 

 Mannan's father,  , told reporters that his son's decision to join Hizbul Mujahideen was "shocking" for the family.
 
 "He has taken this decision (of joining militancy) himself and without my knowledge. He has pained his 'papa' and saddened his mom with his step; he has upset his lone sister," Ahmad said at his residence in Takipora village in north Kashmir's   district. "He (Manan) is a mature person. I never expected this from him. If he had any issues, he could have addressed it some other way."
 
 Mannan was pursuing a doctorate degree in Geology at AMU and was scheduled to return home three days ago but failed to turn up. Instead, a photo of him went viral on social media, showing him posing calmly with what looked like a grenade launcher-cum-assault rifle, soon after his family lodged a missing person complaint with Jammu & Kashmir police.
 
 Asking his 26-year-old son to give up militancy come back, his mother said, "We are ready to live in penury. Please get him back." 
 
 People who know Mannan expressed their concern over his decision to join the militant ranks.
 
 "Research scholar joins militancy, yi gov gatakar (this is unbelievable). Who would tell us why he decided to do this? There must be some reason; radicalisation can't apply in this case (sic)," Prof  , former HoD of Kashmir University's English Department wrote on his Facebook wall.
