Chandigarh: Manimajra is going to have   centres in various areas to bring citizen-centric public services to the masses. The proposal came up on Monday during a meeting between the municipal corporation chief engineer and members of the Modern Housing Complex resident welfare association (RWA).

 The space for these centres was proposed to be created in the community centres of Manimajra. Municipal commissioner Jitender Yadav, who is in charge of information technology, agreed to open e-Sampark centres in the proposed areas and asked for a room for it in each community centre for the installation of computers.
 
 RWA president Colonel Gursewak Singh said the authorities concerned had accepted a long-pending demand of the residents, who were hoping for these centres to be opened soon. “The space is available,” he said. “Only equipment need to be fitted. The MC has agreed to write to the Chandigarh Administration about our demand.”
 
 On November 12, 2017, the residents had raised the issue with local Member of Parliament Kirron Kher during her visit to Manimajra. The residents complained had complained to her that for depositing their electricity and water supply bills, they had to travel a long distance, as there was no Sampark centre nearby. The MP had agreed to take up the matter with the authority concerned and get Manimajra its much-awaited Sampark centres.
