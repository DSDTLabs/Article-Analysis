RAJKOT: Powerful Patel leader and BJP MP from Porbandar, Vitthal Radadia, ruffled a few feathers in the   (PAAS) camp when he said that quota stir leader   had nothing to do with Leuva Patidars.

 Radadia was speaking to mediapersons at Khodaldham in Kagvad when he was asked about Hardik’s efforts to unite Leuva and   in their fight for reservation. 
 
 The BJP strongman’s comment has not gone down well with PAAS. “Radadia’s statement has exposed the BJP’s real face. It shows how the BJP is trying to create a rift between Kadvas and Leuvas for votebank politics. Hardik has managed to unite the factions and the government is rattled by our unity,” said Hemang Patel, the Rajkot convenor of PAAS.
 
 “Such statements from BJP leaders will not dent Patidar unity and Radadia should understand this at the earlier, lest he face the ire of Patidars,” Patel said.
 
 PAAS’s Saurashtra convener, Lalit Vasoya, said Radadia’s comment was personal and should not be related to the  . The trust has invited Umiyadham-Sidsar and Umiyadham-Unjha for the idol installation ceremony and their leaders have visited Kagvad. “I request all Patidars to ensure that the ceremony at Kagvad remains peaceful,” Vasoya said in a statement.
 
 Former CM Keshubhai Patel, a Leuva Patel, had praised ‘this boy’ (Hardik) for bringing Leuvas and Kadvas together.
