MUMBAI: The   has granted divorce to a   who endured  , arrests, assault on his mother suffering from cancer, his brother being dragged in a molestation case, detention and litigation in courts at the hands of his wife. She has been told to pay him Rs 50,000 as costs.

 
 A division bench of Justice Kamalkishor Tated and Justice Burgess Colabawalla held that the man was entitled to divorce on the grounds of cruelty under the Hindu Marriage Act. The man said the harassment at the hands of his wife during their decade-old relationship had tarnished his and his family’s reputation.
 
 
  
 
  
 One of the major incidents was when she accused her husband’s brother, a medical practitioner, of sending goons to molest her. The case had been quashed when it was revealed that at the time of the incident, the brother-in-law was in the sessions court applying for anticipatory bail in another case that she had lodged.
 
 “There was no real substance in the FIR. We clearly find that this complaint would certainly amount to cruelty as it tarnished the image of the husband and his family and would certainly amount to cruelty,” the bench ruled.
 
 The HC struck down the family court’s order refusing to grant divorce and asking him to pay her Rs 15,000 maintenance. It, however, upheld an order asking him to pay monthly maintenance for the couple’s son, who lives with his wife. “The trial court had completely gone wrong in not granting a decree of divorce in favour of the husband. The mistake that the trial court has made is that it has wrongly examined each incident independently rather than looking at the case in its totality,” said the HC.
 
 The family court refused to believe that the man’s mother had been assaulted by his fourmonth pregnant wife. “It is not a reason to hold that she would not be able give a blow to her mother-in-law,” said the HC.
