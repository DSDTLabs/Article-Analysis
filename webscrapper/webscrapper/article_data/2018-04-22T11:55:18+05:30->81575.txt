 (GUNTUR DISTRICT): A 42-year-old man allegedly throttled to death his two differently abled sons at his residence at   in Macherla in the early hours of Saturday.

 The deceased were identified as 10-year-old P Shashank Reddy and eight-year-old P  , both mentally and physically challenged. 
 
 The boys’ grandmother woke up to a rude shock to find both the kids lying limp in the bed, Macherla circle inspector   said. After she raised an alarm, the family members discovered that the boys’ father  , a clerk with a realtor, was missing. 
 
 On receiving information, a police team reached the spot and examined the crime scene. Police suspect that the boys could have been throttled to death or even poisoned. The inspector said they suspect Brahma Reddy murdered the children, but were awaiting post-mortem reports to ascertain the cause of death. Police sources said Brahma Reddy had been suffering from a chronic disease for the past one year and slipped into depression. 
 
 Cops also suspect it could be a suicide pact, where he might have chosen to kill his children first and then killed himself somewhere else.
 
 Meanwhile, a pall of gloom descended on the household as the kids’ mother   remained in a state of shock and refused to move away from the bodies. 
 
 Anitha and Brahma Reddy have three children, incidentally all of them are  . Cops said the youngest child, a six-year-old, was sleeping next to Anitha on the bed, while the other kids were sleeping near their grandmother’s room. 
 
 “We are yet to ascertain the motive behind the crime. On one hand, Brahma Reddy is reportedly in depression. On the other, we learnt that he often expressed his anger about the fact that his children were differently abled,” Dileep told TOI. 
 
 However, as of now, police have registered a case under Section 174 (suspicious death) of the CrPC and sent their bodies for post-mortem examination. They have launched a manhunt to trace Brahma Reddy.
