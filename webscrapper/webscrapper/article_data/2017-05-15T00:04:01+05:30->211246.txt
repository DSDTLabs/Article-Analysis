JAIPUR: The bitter but homely ‘karela’ ( ) fuelled a family feud in  , resulting in a 30-year-old man climbing up a several feet-high   after he got fed up with daily fights in the house over the vegetable.

 The ‘high drama’ was enacted in the middle of the village by   who climbed up the tower to settle the   in the family once and for all.
 
 Here goes the story: “Papu’s father Rekha Ram had returned from Nokha town in Bikaner on Saturday to find Papu’s wife had prepared bitter gourd dish for lunch. This infuriated Rekha who alleged that his daughter-in-law had prepared bitter gourd deliberately to irritate him,” said deputy SP and Sujangarh circle officer Shukhvinder Pal Singh.
 
 Rekha had a verbal spat with his daughter-in-law over this and when Papu came home he found the two having a bitter fight.
 
 An angry Papu walked out and a few hours later at 2.30pm was spotted atop a mobile tower in Kanuta village under the limits of Bidasar police station.
 
 “He was heard shouting at the top of his voice about the constant fight in the family over the choice of vegetables. He claimed that he would not climb down until the family found a solution to this everyday bickering,” Singh said.
 
 Soon the entire village gathered at the scene, with some younger members taking pictures of Papu on the mobile tower.
 
 His father also reached the spot and told the police that he had asked his daughter-in-law not to cook any gourd-related dish on several occasions, but she never listened to him.
 
 With Papu in mood to budge even after several pleas from the police and the family, his cousin climbed up the tower after about four hours on the pretext of giving him a bottle of water and persuaded him. “He finally came down. He was detained and later released,” Singh said.
