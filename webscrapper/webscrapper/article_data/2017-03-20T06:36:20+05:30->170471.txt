AGARTALA:   Radha Mohan Singh on Sunday criticized the Left Front government in   for not utilizing funds released by the Centre. 

 The minister said the state government never tired of blaming the Centre for not sanctioning enough funds for the development of the state.
 
 "But what we want to say is that despite getting enough funds, this government is not utilizing them properly and is not interested in helping the poor," he said.
 
 Quoting statistics, he said that in the last three years, from 2010-11 to 2014-15, the   government had sanctioned funds three times more than the previous government did in the last five years.
 
 "While the previous government had sanctioned Rs 7,646 crore, the Modi government, after coming to power in 2014, sanctioned Rs 23,655 crore for the agriculture sector in the state." he said.
