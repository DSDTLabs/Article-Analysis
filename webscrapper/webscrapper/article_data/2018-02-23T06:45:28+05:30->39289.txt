KOLKATA: Good old ropes were back at the   crossing on Thursday, after three days of trial with one of the most technologically advanced tools to control pedestrian crossover on the city roads. The city’s first pair of pedestrian boom barriers, installed at the Exide crossing around 10 days ago and which began its trial run last Monday, turned static since Thursday morning because of a signal glitch.

 Engineers were called in and they got to work during the peak hour, but the glitch could not be rectified till late evening. With the 5m-bar stuck in the vertical position, cops deployed civic volunteers with ropes which the Kolkata Police has been successfully using across several key crossings in the city for several years to prevent unruly jaywalkers from spilling on to the carriageway. “There was a glitch in the synchronization of the barrier with the pedestrian signal system. The glitch was noticed during the second day of the trial run itself. We tried to repair it, but the problem intensified,” said a traffic sergeant at the spot.
 
 A senior engineer working on the signalling system on Thursday said according to the initial set up, the pedestrian signal time was too limited for the boom barrier to move up and then allow people to cross over.
 
 “We have been working to increase the time as well. Another problem was that the system allowed the pedestrian signals at the two crossings — in front of   and Exide — to operate at the same time as vehicles turned left. Hence, the entire idea was lost. We are working to tweak the timing according to the lane signalling as well,” said the engineer.
 
 At Exide crossing, installation work for the first set of boom barriers had begun on February 8. Similar barriers have also come up at SN   crossing, but they haven’t been in operation.
