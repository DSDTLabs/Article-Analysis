AMRITSAR: The general body of the Chief   approved the expulsion of its president   on Tuesday, a day after its executive committee had recommended his ouster from the Sikh organization. The general house, which met here at Gurdwara Kalghidhar Sahib, also decided to hold elections to the vacant posts of the CKD within 60 days. A few members raised objections and also gave their suggestion on running the institution.

 After an objectionable video of Chadha, along with a woman principle of one of the schools run under the management of the CKD went viral on the internet on the evening of December 26, 2017, CKD member   had approached the   seeking summoning of Chadha.
 
 This was followed by similar complaints with the Akal Takht secretariat. On December 28, 2017, Gurbachan Singh summoned Chadha to appear before the Sikh clergy.
 
 On January 23, Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh had directed CKD secretary N S Khurana to accept Chadhaâ€™s resignation and suspend him from the primary membership and inform about the same to the Akal Takht secretariat.
