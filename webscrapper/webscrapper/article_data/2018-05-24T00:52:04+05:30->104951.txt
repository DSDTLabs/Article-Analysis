Coimbatore: Scoring centum in Social Science,  ,  ,  .

 A resident of Periyanaickenpalayam, Sabari said he expected more than 490 marks. “Social Science is one of my favourite subjects next to languages, as I could study it without depending much on others,” he told TOI.
 
 A student of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Sabari has opted Humanities for higher secondary. He said it would let him work independently unlike the Science subjects where he will have to depend on scribes. Moreover, studying Sociology and Humanities would assist him in his growth, he said.
 
 Sabari used several read-aloud and recording software for studying. He started to give motivational speeches when he was in Class I and has been travelling across the country to share his wisdom.
 
 He wants to become either a civil servant or an entrepreneur as he believes that such positions could allow him work independently.
 
 While thanking his parents and teachers for the achievement, Sabari said that not everyone extend support to the differently-abled people. Reacting to the incidents where differently-abled people are discriminated, he said that they are not welcomed with open hands. “It is high time to bring in changes in the society. Just like everyone, we have unique talents and could achieve success,” he added.
