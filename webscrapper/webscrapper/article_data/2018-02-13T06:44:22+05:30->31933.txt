AHMEDABAD: While the state wears its tag as ‘safe for women’ proudly,  , in 2017, were approached by six times the number of women, who approached the   in 2016 against dowry demands and torture by in-laws. The silver lining is, the overall crimes against women were down by 9.8% for the same period.

 According to   (NCRB) report for the year 2016, Gujarat ranked 15th among 29 Indian states in terms of crime committed against women. 
 
 CID (crime) officials said that compared to 86 cases registered under IPC Section 498A coupled with Dowry Prohibition Act in 2016, 2017 reported 656 cases. On the other hand, cases of 498A along with other IPC sections reduced by 28% in the same period. Two other categories that reported rise include molestation (6%) and rape (1.4%).
 
 Anil Pratham, ADGP, CID (crime), said that the overall number of such crimes has come down. “We have also launched initiatives such as ‘Friends of Women and Children’ to address the issue. Sensitization courses for police are also conducted at a regular intervals,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 While many experts accepted that the law is misused to some extent, the other faction points out at the plight of women. Meena Jagtap, a city-based lawyer, said that women have become more empowered and are more self-sufficient compared to earlier times. However, statistics reveal that the scenario has not changed much. “It’s not only dowry demands — the society’s mentality is also reflected in other crimes against women. I believe that the number of unreported cases might be higher,” she said.
 
 Abhayam 181 helpline for women also reflects the same trend where last year reported a jump of about 10% compared to 2016. Jashvant Prajapati, COO, EMRI Gujarat that operates Abhayam 181 helpline, said that they saw the rise in number of calls as a sign of greater awareness among general population about their rights.
