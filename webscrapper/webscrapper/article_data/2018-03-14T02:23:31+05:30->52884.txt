NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police constable has been accused of running an   drug   and supplying contraband like heroin and cocaine to students of different colleges in Delhi and adjoining states, sources have informed.

 The revelation was made after Karnal police arrested four people, including a final year BAMS student, with around 0.5kg heroin worth Rs 2 crore.
 
 The accused student, Vijay Kumar, studied at a college in Rohtak. During interrogation, he named a Delhi constable as the ring-leader of the cartel. Vijay’s statement was then corroborated by the other accused arrested in the case, Kishor Kumar of Kohand village and Rajinder Pal of Munak village.
 
 On Tuesday, Karnal police conducted raids in Delhi to nab the accused constable. He is, however, still at large, said a senior police officer.
 
 Kumar is a resident of Alipur and was in touch with the constable, who he identified as Kuldeep. According to Kumar, Kuldeep is posted in the summons cell of a district, police said.
 
 The CIA-2 unit of Karnal police had information that members of the syndicate would leave Delhi with the contraband in a Swift Dzire car and travel to Ambala. Traps were laid at several places on National Highway-44 on March 9 and the accused were intercepted. After their arrest, the drugs were seized from their car.
 
 “The contraband was procured from Madhya Pradesh and was being supplied to students in Kurukshetra, Ambala and Patiala districts of Punjab,” SP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa told reporters.
