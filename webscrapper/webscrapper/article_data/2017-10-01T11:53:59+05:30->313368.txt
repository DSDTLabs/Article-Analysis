PATIALA: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president   has refused to accept the summons issued by the  , set up for probing the cases of desecration of Guru Grant Sahib, stating that he would not appear before a panel appointed by the   government.

 Interacting with the newspersons after chairing a meeting of SGPC at Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib here on Saturday, Badungar said SGPC was the supreme body managing the religious affairs of the Sikhs and its president could not be summoned by a commission that has been appointed by a state government to look into the issues concerning the Sikhs.
 
 He said the SGPC executive had collectively taken the decision of not appearing before the commission. He said the committee had clearly rejected the Justice Ranjit commission and there was no point of appearing before it or submitting any documents.
 
 The commission had recently served summons on Badungar asking him to appear before it on October 8. He had also been asked to bring along any documents related to the incidents of sacrilege and also of the pardon granted by the Akal Takht to the rape convict   head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. The commission had also summoned Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh.
