MUMBAI: The   has fined   Rs 58.9 crore for selling   (G-secs) from a portfolio that was classified as long-term investments - bonds being intended to be held to maturity (HTM). This is the highest penalty imposed by the RBI on a bank for a single incident. 

 In a press release issued on Thursday, the   said it has imposed a penalty on ICICI Bank for "non-compliance with directions issued by the RBI on direct sale of securities from its HTM portfolio and specified disclosure in this regard". 
 
 Under RBI guidelines, lenders have to split their holding of government securities into HTM, available for sale (AFS) and held for trading (HFT) categories. Under existing guidelines, lenders can shift investments to/from HTM with the approval of the board of directors once a year, and such shifting will normally be allowed at the beginning of the accounting year. The RBI had allowed banks to shift their excess government securities, along with direct sale from the HTM category to AFS/HFT. However, this relaxation came into force only on October 4, 2017.
 
 ICICI Bank said, "The bank had continued with sales from the HTM category for a few weeks during the quarter ended March 2017 due to genuine misunderstanding on the timing of the applicability of the RBI's direction in the matter."
 
 In its press statement on the fine, the RBI has not indicated which period the violation pertained to. The October 2017 relaxation allows lenders to transfer G-secs in addition to the shifting permitted at the beginning of the accounting year - in the month of April.
