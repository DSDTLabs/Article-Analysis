HYDERABAD: In a huge relief to teachers with  , the   has declared that all the appointments made under DSC 2008 shall now stand regularised in all respects.

 The division bench comprising   and   pronounced this order while closing three petitions that challenged the action of the authorities in reserving 30 percent of the posts in the cadre of Secondary Grade Teachers (SGT) for candidates with DEd qualification. The authorities did this by adding a proviso to Rule 7 of the AP Direct Recruitment for the posts of Teachers (Scheme of Selection) Rules 2008.
 
 The petitioners said that the modification was made to the rules after the commencement of the DSC-2008 selection process through the notification issued on December 6, 2008. Earlier, the high court suspended the operation of the proviso added to Rule 7 and said that all the appointments made shall become valid or invalid based on the final outcome of the writ petition. However, the state informed that such a situation would not arise as it did not implement the reservation for the DEd candidates after the HC's intervention and interim order.
 
 In view of this, the bench said, "We are of the opinion that the issue raised in these writ petitions is now rendered purely academic." While closing the petitions, the bench said that all the appointments made in this regard shall now stand regularised and that no stay order should operate against them.
