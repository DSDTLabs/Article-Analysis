NAGPUR: Citing construction of   and flyovers across the city,   ( ) has proposed to scrap its much-hyped project to construct foot overbridges (FOBs) at 24 locations in city. The civic body has also proposed to engage a private company for biomining of 10 lakh tonnes garbage lying idle at Bhandewadi dumping yard for decades at a whopping cost of Rs 101.50 crore.

 These are part of the agenda for NMC standing committee meeting to be held on May 10. NMC’s projects department in its proposal also sought committee’s permission to terminate the agreements with two private companies and one consultant for constructing 24 FOBs in 2012.
 
 “There are various hurdles in construction of FOBs due to ongoing works of   Rail and flyovers. Also, there is a PIL filed against some of the proposed FOBs in the High Court. Therefore, it is better to scrap the project,” the department said.
 
 The Pench project cell has proposed to issue work order to   for biomining of 10 lakh tonnes garbage. The project is likely to put an end to frequent fire incidents at the garbage dumping site.
 
 As per the proposal, NMC will pay Rs 1,051 per tonne to the private company. It will amount to a whopping Rs 101.50 crore for entire 10 lakh tonnes. It is also proposed to produce refuse derived fuel (RDF) from the garbage. If successful, the cost will reduce by Rs 250 per tonne saving NMC about Rs 25 crore.
 
 Another proposal is to appoint Central Road Research Institute for improving and monitoring the quality of cement roads being constructed under Rs 324 crore cement concrete road project Phase-II. The proposal may invite controversy as the demand from social organizations was for a third party audit of the roads. Also, many roads under the project are being built or are nearing completion.
