NEW DELHI: Ahead of Bangladesh’s first Test match on Indian soil, we take a look back to the first Test match played between these two teams - which was also Bangladesh’s first ever.  This match was played at the erstwhile home of Bangladesh cricket - the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka, the country’s capitol. Since 2005, however, the stadium has only hosted football matches. This was Test match number 1512, played between November 10-13, 2000.  Bangladesh captain Naimur Rahman won the toss and chose to bat, much to the home fans’ joy. From 44/2, Bangladesh were led to a strong platform by Habibul Bashar and Aminul Islam, who put on 66 for the third wicket until the former was out for 71 off 112 balls. Aminul and Akram Khan (35) then added 65, before a brief wobble ensued. Akram’s dismissal at 175/4 became 231/6 and by stumps the hosts were 239/6. Aminul was 70 not out, wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud 3 not out.  Aminul converted his innings into a century, and was ninth out at 395/9 having scored 145 off 380 balls, with 17 fours. Mashud (34), Mohammad Rafique (22) and Hasibul Hossain (28*) chipped in down the order and Bangladesh were out for 400 in 153.3 overs. By stumps, India were 81/1 with Sadagoppan Ramesh on 41 and nightwatchman Murali Kartik on 7. Skipper Naimur, aged 26, took Bangladesh’s first wicket in Test cricket when he bowled SS Das for 29.    India lost two wickets in the morning session, that of Ramesh for 58 and Rahul Dravid for 28, and were 165/3 at lunch with Kartik still there on 37. The biggest scalp came during the afternoon when Sachin Tendulkar fell for 18 to Naimur, who then added Kartik for 43 (both wickets caught by the substitute fielder, Rajin Saleh). At 190/5 India were in trouble, but the recover came via the captain Sourav Ganguly and wicketkeeper Saba Karim, who put on 46 in 15.3 overs. Karim became Naimur’s fourth wicket, but then came a partnership of 121 between Ganguly and spinner Sunil Joshi. Naimur removed Ganguly for 84, his fifth wicket of the innings, and India closed the day on 366/7 with Joshi on 71. Joshi (92) and Ajit Agarkar (34) and their eighth-wicket stand of 56 in 15.5 overs helped India to 429. Naimur finished with figures of 6/132 from 44.3 overs, but what proceeded left the Bangladesh fans stunned and India on course for a facile win. From having bowled India out shortly before lunch, Bangladesh were very much in the game but then their naivety came to the fore. They were all out for 91 in 46.3 overs, on a pitch with no exaggerated spin or slow and low bounce. Zaheer Khan and Agarkar made early inroads before Joshi took over with three wickets, including those of opener Shahriar Hossain and the middle-order pair of Al Sahariar and Akram, and at 53/5 Bangladesh were in tatters. Javagal Srinath hasted the team’s downfall with three wickets, and India were set a target of 63.  After the early loss of Ramesh for 1, Ganguly’s team won by nine wickets. Das was 22 not out and Dravid 41 off 49 balls, with five fours and a six. Ganguly had won his first Test match as captain.
