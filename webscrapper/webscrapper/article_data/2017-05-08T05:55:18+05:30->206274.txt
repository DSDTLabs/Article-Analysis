PATNA:   Amit Shah on Sunday nominated the party’s former Bihar chief   as organisational in-charge for poll-bound  , indicating that a couple of more senior functionaries from the state could be picked up for higher organisational assignment.
 
  Present Bihar BJP chief Nityanand Rai and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi thanked Shah for making Pandey the organisational in-charge of HP, which would have the assembly elections in November this year.
  
  “The fact that our national president picked up Pandey for the new assignment in HP is good news for the state BJP,” said state BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel.
  
  Earlier, during the recently concluded assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Pandey was election in-charge of the party in its Awadh region comprising 14 districts and 82 assembly constituencies. The BJP won 68 of the 82 seats in the region, which was a big achievement for the party, as it had only six MLAs from the 82 constituencies in 2012, said Bihar BJP media in-charge Ashok Bhatt.
  
  Yet another media in-charge, Pankaj Kumar Singh, said the relocation of Pandey for another role in a poll-bound state is a matter of pride for the rank and file, including party vice-president Devesh Kumar and national media co-in-charge Sanjay Mayukh (MLC).
  
  Former minister Nand Kishore Yadav, who had also been asked to work in UP polls, along with Pandey would be accommodated in the national organisational set up after the expected reshuffle of the Union cabinet in May, according to the grapevine at the state BJP headquarters.
  
  “The ultimate decision lies with the party’s national president. It is being hoped that a few other senior functionaries would also be picked up. Though no one here can say who are such functionaries,” said Patel.
