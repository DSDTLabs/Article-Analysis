KARWAR: Uttar Pradesh chief minister   on Tuesday said Murudeshwar, which is known as the abode of Lord Shiva, has been defamed by   forces from the region.

 Addressing an election meeting, Yogi said, this election is not a regular one, but a referendum on the security of the country and a fight against jihadi forces.
 
 Yogi said people in the rest of India are afraid of the very name ‘Bhatkal’, which has become synonymous with terrorism. Electing   from the constituency will change Bhatkal’s identity into a town of temples.
