CHENNAI: With profiles of legislators in the Tamil Nadu assembly changing dramatically, English has also become the language of debate. DMK MLA P T R  , who spoke on the governor's address, initially began in Tamil. He faltered a bit, then quickly switched to English. Soon, Tamil official language and Tamil culture minister K   joined the debate, also speaking in English. 

 Thiagarajan, who was formerly head of Lehman Brothers' offshore operations in the US, started off in Tamil, saying, "Assembly under   government has not met frequently. I have data to show that the assembly sessions are far less compared to those during the DMK regime. Unless it meets often, how can MLAs raise problems faced by people in their constituencies?"
 
 Deputy CM   shot back saying that the working hours were seeing a rise every day of a session under the AIADMK regime. Thiagarajan said he had data only for a few years. Later, the DMK MLA switched to English, encouraged by speaker P Dhanapal, who gave him 20 minutes to finish. Pandiarajan, himself a former head of a management consultant firm, replied to him in English, defending the government. As both Thiagarajan and Pandiarajan sparred in English, ministers and MLAs watched silently, without interruptions. But, the exchange ended as others joined in and finally Thiagarajan was not allowed even to thank the speaker.
