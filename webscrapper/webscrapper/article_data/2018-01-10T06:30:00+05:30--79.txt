Hubballi: Elected representatives will have to think twice before stepping into Hebsur village,   taluk, as its residents have barred them from holding any political meet or event. 

 ZP president   had to face angry residents when she tried to have a   meeting on Monday evening to create awareness about legal services and other government schemes for women. 
 
 When she went there with some ZP officials, villagers did not allow her to proceed to the programme. Angry villagers pointed out that they had barred the entry of elected representatives to the village as they had not found a solution to the  . Though Chaitra pleaded with villagers and tried to convince them that it wasn’t a party event but a government programme, villagers opposed her visit.
 
 A heated argument ensued between her and the villagers when she insisted she would conduct the function. Villagers lay down on the road and dared her to cross them.
 
 After a discussion, she returned without holding the event. In the next couple of days, she’ll announce the fresh dates for the programme.
 
 Gururayan Gowder and other village heads told TOI: “We won’t allow any politician to have an event in our village. All political parties are playing with our emotions by not solving the Mahadayi issue to release 7.56tmcft of water from   to Malaprabha river.”
 
 He added: “We’re fed up with politicians’ lackadaisical attitude to the issue. That’s why we have decided not allow any politician or elected representative to have any event here. Political parties should convince the Prime Minister to end this matter. The tribunal had given time till February 22 to find out an amicable solution if riparian states failed to solve it. Then, the tribunal will take its own decision.”
