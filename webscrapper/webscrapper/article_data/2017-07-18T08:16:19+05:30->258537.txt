GANDHINAGAR:  , rebel BJP MLA from Dhari, Amreli district, who had joined BJP after former Gujarat CM,  's   (GPP) had merged with BJP, has openly claimed that he had voted against NDA's presidential candidate,  , to register his protest against injustices inflicted on the Patidar community. 

 Kotadiya told reporters on Monday, "Yes, I have voted against NDA's presidential candidate to register my protest against BJP's injustices towards Patidar community and the farmers. I have voted for the UPA candidate."
 
 Kotadiya had won his first MLA seat with a ticket from GPP. However, after the 2012 polls, Keshubhai resigned from GPP, and Gordhan Zadaphia, the party's co-founder, along with Kotadiya and others, joined BJP. 
 
 In 2015, Kotadiya had publicly supported Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader Hardik Patel and the call raised by Patidars demanding OBC status. Since then, he has been at loggerheads with the BJP top brass.
 
  In the 2015 local body elections, he had campaigned against BJP candidates. In 2016, Kotadiya faced an alleged extortion case lodged by an Ahmedabad-based builder.
 
 In response to Kotadiya's act, Gujarat CM, Vijay Rupani, said, "He is not in BJP. We can't issue any mandate to him."
 
 Rupani said about the rebel MLA that he had never attended any meeting of BJP. "He was elected as a GPP candidate. He is openly with Congress and misleading people. We are in clear majority and his vote does not matters to us," Rupani said.
