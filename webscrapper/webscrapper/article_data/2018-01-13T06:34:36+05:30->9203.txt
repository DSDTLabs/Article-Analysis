AHMEDABAD: A day after a cow strayed near the runway at   (SVPI) airport, the incident has raised questions about the “four-tier security” at the city airport. To find out whether there were flaws in the security system of the international airport, the   ( ) will conduct an inquiry into how the cow got so near the runway.

 Sources in the   (AAI) said that the CISF probe will try to find out how the cow had got into the high-security and sensitive runway area.
 
 “Prime facie, it seems a security lapse due to human error. The CISF IG himself is monitoring the inquiry,” an official said. Incidentally, the CISF jawan, who was posted at the gate, has been transferred.
 
 The AAI has already sought a report on the incident from the city airport authorities but as it was an incident of security lapse, the CISF, which looks after security of the airport, will probe the incident.
 
 Sources further said that the airport authorities may also take the help of the civic body ( ) to control the other menace - that of dogs straying near the runway.
 
 “Not only stray cows but stray dogs are also a big concern. Now and then, they are found to have entered right up to the operational area. We are in talks with the civic body which will keep their vehicles deployed near the airport to catch stray animals, especially cows,” said an official.
 
 The airport authorities are also planning to double the gates of the airport and also to put animal traps to prevent recurrence of such incidents.
 
 The ‘freak incident’ had taken place at around 3am on Thursday. Personnel of the CISF, ATC (air traffic control) and airport fire staff struggled for nearly one-anda-half hours with sticks and airgun to remove the cow from the area. Arrival of around five flights and two departures were also affected by the incident. Two of the five flights were diverted to Mumbai.
