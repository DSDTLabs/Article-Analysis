TIRUPUR: As the city corporation has decided to revise property taxes up by four times, the opposition parties have condemned the civic body and urged to withdraw its decision.

 The opposition parties also wanted the people to come forward to stop the tax revision as it would take a toll on them amid the effects of demonetisation and GST. As per information obtained under the RTI Act by the  , the corporation has decided to collect Rs 2.10 to Rs 3.40 per sqft for tiled-roof houses against the present rate of 80 paise to Rs 1.10 per sqft. The tax should be paid every six months. Earlier, there were only two categories but now three categories - A, B and C. In case of commercial establishments, it varies from Rs 6.10 to Rs 18.13. 
 
 “Though it was warranted to increase the taxes every 10 years, increasing four times the present rate cannot be accepted. Now, the central government has stopped funds to the local bodies due to absence of people’s representatives. So, the lack of funds has created havoc in the developmental projects and also routine civil body services. Instead of drawing funds from the governments, the corporation has decided to put the financial burden on the people,” said S  , Tirupur district CPM secretary.
 
 “Taking such a vital decision with the absence of people’s representatives would not go well. It should have taken after the completion of the local body elections, which would have paved way for the righteous debates on the tax revision,” Muthukannan added. 
 
 However, former DMK mayor   differed from CPM’s stand on the issue. He said, “It cannot be said that such decision should be taken only with the approval of the corporation council. But the revision should be fair and it should not affect the people. We also found that the possible revised tax rates were high. It should be reduced.”
