THANE: Police commissioner   has cautioned the vulnerable age group of teens and children in the city against falling prey to the life-threatening tasks delivered online through   challenge.

Singh said parents should be alert about any sudden behavioural change in their children where they turn secretive while surfing online, display mood swings and close their computer screens when approached by a family member or friends.
 
 The Blue Whale Challenge is a game which gives out 50 task and concludes by asking the player to end his/her life. 
 
 “So far there have been no such incidents in the city where individuals have played the game and ended their lives or hurt themselves. However, we are issuing an advisory to make sure that the youth does not fall prey to any such challenges,” said Singh. 
 
 The advisory note also urged teachers to conduct programmes for students explaining to them about the dangers of the game and even sharing personal details with strangers. The authorities will be conducting drives in schools and colleges and talking not only to students but even teachers. Also, the advisory will be posted on social networking sites as the challenges are sent through social networking sites or mobile applications.
 
 “Teachers will be asked to keep an eye on the students’ grades and notify the parents if there is a sudden fall, to keep a tab on their social behaviour and even regulate the use of e-gadgets in schools. Some sessions will be taken with parents wherein they will be advised to ensure that the child uses internet under an adult’s supervision and parents talk to kids so that he/she talks about any kind of trouble when approached by the challenge,” said a senior officer.
