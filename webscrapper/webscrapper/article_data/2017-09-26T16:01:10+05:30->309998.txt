MADURAI: A former guest lecturer in the department of journalism and science communication at   Kamaraj University stabbed the head of the department several times as he was aggrieved over not being recruited for the job in this academic year. 

 The injured head of the department has been identified as S Jenefa, who is an associate professor. She was admitted to a private hospital where her condition was said to stable.
 
 The accused, Jothimurugan, 34, of Kulamangalam, was working as a guest lecturer in the department last year. He was teaching practical classes on photography and layout designing. However, his contract was not renewed due to his poor performance last year.
 
 The guest lecturers are selected by the department based on requirement. Jothimurugan had approached department again requesting him to be reappointed. However, last Friday, the department conducted an interview and selected two people as guest lecturers.
 
 Jothimurugan came to the department on Tuesday morning and met head of department Jenefa in her chamber. He drew a knife and stabbed her multiple times. 
 
 He quietly left her chamber but remained on the campus. 
 
 Hearing Jenefa’s screams, students came to help her. She was rushed to a primary health care centre at Nagamalai Pudukottai. Later, she was shifted to a private hospital in Madurai.
 
 Students caught hold of Jothimurugan and handed him over the Nagamalai Pudukottai police who reached the spot after being informed about the murder attempt. The police registered a case.
 
 MKU vice-chancellor P P Chellathurai visited Jenefa in the hospital.
 
 Addressing reporters later, Chellathurai said it was a shocking incident. “A head of department can’t provide jobs for all applicants, and there are certain norms and requirements from candidates for appointment. The university will take some precautionary measures for the safety of the teaching and non-teaching staff,” he said.
