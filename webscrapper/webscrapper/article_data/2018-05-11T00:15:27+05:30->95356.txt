Thiruvananthapuram: According to an annual case study conducted by Childline Project authorities in the capital city, children are more vulnerable to sexual abuses at home.

  As per the annual study report of the Childline Project, there were 100 cases of child sexual abuse reported in last financial year out of which the place of abuse in 40 cases happened to be the survivor’s house.
 
 The study pertains to cases of child sexual abuses reported through Childline Project from April 2017 to March 2018.
 
 Father Thomas P D, director, Childine Project, opined that the social and economic background of the families could be a reason behind this phenomenon.
 
 ‘’We have noticed that majority of cases, in which survivor’s house is the place of abuse, is reported among families from poor financial backgrounds. In their cases, parents may be so busy trying to earn a living and children are left unattended. They don’t understand the importance of sensitising their wards about such dangers,” Thomas said.
 
 Dr G Mohan Roy, clinical psychiatrist and Resident Medical Officer at Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital said that child sexual abuses continue to happen because the perpetrators think that there would not be any resistance from the prey . “Now, more cases pertaining to child sexual abuses are being reported because people are becoming more aware,” he said.
 
 In 27 cases, the survivor’s relative happened to be the abuser. Of this biological parents are accused in four cases and grandparents and stepparents are accused in five cases each. Relatives, who had access to the survivor’s residence, are accused in 23 cases.
 
 The category of friend/lover features as accused in most number of cases (34). The second spot is occupied by neighbours with 29 cases.
