CHARMINAR: Built during the   period and situated in a busy residential area, the archaeological grandeur - the   - has turned into an eyesore. Despite being a protected monument, the mosque shows how maintenance without vision can be detrimental to the existence of an ancient structure. 

 While the entire structure is covered in blackened algae, broken minarets and huge cracks on the walls, the lime plaster and the stuccowork can also be seen peeling off at many places. The foliage grown on all four sides and constructions have come up have completely blocked the view of the main structure.
 
 As per the government declaration, the mosque is a protected monument under the   and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1960. Yet, it still remains in a dilapidated state.
 
 The mosque also incubates a courtyard which is now enclosed by a boundary wall.
 
 A Shaikpet resident,   said, "The mosque is locked up for over an year. There have been several encroachments around it. I wonder if the   is even aware of its existence." 
 
 The State Archaeology Department officials were not available for a response. According to Mohammed Habeebuddin, Wakf activist, the Archaeology department and   have been ignoring the issue for a while. "It is a Wakf registered property, so the Wakf board also has to take some serious action against the encroachments and restoration of the Mosque. Since there are just a handful of days left for the month of Ramzan, it will be good if the Wakf authorities can at least clean the surroundings and re-open the mosque," Habeebuddin said.
 
 "The government should take restoration, renovation and preservation of heritage buildings as a business plan. If they invest 100 crores, their goals should be 500 crores return," Mohammad Safiullah, Deccan Heritage Trust, said .
