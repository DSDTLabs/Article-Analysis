JAIPUR:   as replacement for   might sound surprising, but  , Rajasthan Royals’ head of cricket is absolutely certain it is the South African that they wanted.

 
 “Our aim was to get someone who can play spin well because we are pretty sure that spinners will have a big role to play during the IPL,” Bharucha told TOI on Thursday after sending a request for the South African to the BCCI. “Klaasen is an amazing player of spin. And he has a vast array of shots, which tempted us to go for him. He plays the reverse sweep very well, something that will be quite useful in the IPL.”
 
 Bharucha admitted that the way Klaasen handled Indian spinners Yazuvendra Chahal and   tilted the scale in his favour. “His strategy against them was just amazing,” Bharucha said.
