JAIPUR: It was nothing less than an adventure for 45-year-old man who opted for a crime like snatching   chains from the neck of women. 

 While he was arrested by the   police on Sunday with the help of a special team when police recovered 20 gold chains from his possession, the accused who is a tent dealer confessed that chain-snatching became his hobby. 
 
 Police, however, said that there could be other possible reasons which prompted him to take up this crime.
 
 According to the police, the district police (west) was already running a campaign against chain snatchers and surveillance was intensified at public places and crowded places.
 
 “We got some   footages and based on other investigations we nailed down the accused identified as  . 
 
 He is a tent dealer in Murlipura locality. We have recovered 20 gold chains from his possession while the accused so far has confessed to have been a part of 40 more such incidents so far,” said Ashok  , deputy commissioner of police(West) on Sunday.
 
 What led the accused who is a tent dealer by profession to indulge in this crime when asked, Gupta, said, “He has claimed that one day after having lunch he took out his bike and wore a helmet with dark visor and snatched a woman’s chain. He used to visit the narrow lanes in the afternoon to find woman walking on the road with a gold chain. Since he was not caught he continued. However, we believe there could be other possible reasons behind his act.”
 
 Police will produce him in a court and will take him in police remand to find out where he was selling off the gold chains.
 
 “We can’t just go by his theory. There could be other possible angles into what all he has claimed so far,” said a senior officer.
