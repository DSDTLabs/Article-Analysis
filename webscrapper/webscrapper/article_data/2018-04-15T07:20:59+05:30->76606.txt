LUCKNOW: People occupying   for their temporary use will now have to pay 20% of the DM circle rate as rent.

 The property which belonged to people who migrated from India to Pakistan during Partition was declared enemy property in 1968 under the enemy property Act.
 
 According to the data saved with district administration, there are around 100 enemy properties in Lucknow. While 60 of these have been declared enemy property, cases are underway for around 40 more, which will also be declared enemy property soon.
 
 District magistrate   said that now people occupying enemy property for their temporary use will have to pay 20% amount of the circle rate as rent, which will be applicable according to the area.
 
 Additional district magistrate (  administration) SP   told TOI that tenants were not paying the rent amount as per the value of the property.
 
 However, they have clearly mentioned in the agreement with the custodian that they will pay the amount as per the government rule. Tenants used to pay between Rs500 and Rs2,000 as rent and some had even discontinued the payment after a few years.
 
 In September 2017, the administration constituted a team to enforce the enemy property law to recover the rent amount from tenants. But administrative officials failed to enforced the law
