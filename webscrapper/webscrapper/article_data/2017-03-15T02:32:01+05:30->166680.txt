Minister of state for social justice   has created a controversy by saying he would not be scared of slapping those maligning him as he is a   and not Brahmin. He later retracted his comments saying he used “wrong words inadvertently”.

 “As the government has ended the role of middlemen and agents, some affected elements are trying to malign the government’s image. Am I a Brahmin to be scared of them? I’m a dalit. If they had raised slogan in front of me, I would have slapped them,” he said at a public event at Latur on Sunday. The   from Pune was referring to a protest by some people after a function a day earlier.
 
 State labour minister  , who was presiding over the function, tried to salvage the situation. Referring to Kamble’s comments, Nilangekar said he didn’t expect such a quick side-effect of Nilanga [the area often reports caste tensions] on the social justice minister. He added that one should not mind Kamble’s comment as it came on the occasion of Holi.
 
 Later, Kamble issued a statement retracting his comment. “I was trying to invoke Brahmins in the context of their quality of forgiveness. However, wrong words inadvertently were uttered,” he said, adding that he never intended to hurt the sentiments of any community.
 
 The Brahmin community staged protests in Aurangabad and Latur among other places in Marathwada, demanding an apology. The Marathwada unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Brahmin Mahasangh demanded Kamble’s resignation saying it was unbecoming of a minister holding the social justice portfolio to hold grudge and bias against a particular community.
 
 Anil Mule, a senior leader of the Mahasangh, said, “Kamble has publicly vented out his ill feelings against the Brahmin community and has no moral right to continue as social justice minister.”
