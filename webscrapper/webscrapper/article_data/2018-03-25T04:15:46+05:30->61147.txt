MUMBAI: Chief minister   on Saturday said his government would soon draft a comprehensive action plan to provide state-of-the-art infrastructure for promotion of  . 

 "I am committed to taking all possible steps for promotion of sports. I expect leading sports organisations to come forward,'' he said.
 
 Fadnavis was speaking at the semi-final of a cricket match organised by   in memory of late cricketers Vijay Manjrekar and  . "Our effort will be to impart training to the younger generation and ensure Maharashtra emerges powerful in the field of sports,'' he said.
 
 Fadnavis said it was a wrong assumption that there were fewer opportunities in sports. "Quite a large number of students give up their sports careers after matriculation. We will have to make fresh efforts to change the situation and ensure the younger generation is attracted to sports,'' Fadnavis said.
 
 Stating Pune's Balewadi stadium and other stadia across the state would be put to optimum use, Fadnavis called upon sports organisations to step in. "Sports organisations should give up their commercial approach and, instead, promote players and the sport,'' the CM said.
 
 At another event in the city, Fadnavis launched the no-horn campaign at Wankhede Stadium. All of us must participate in the 'Horn Not OK Please' campaign to curb noise pollution. A study has revealed that honking is to blame for 70% of the noise pollution in the city,'' Fadnavis said.
 
 Transport minister Diwakar Raote, former cricketers   and   also joined the campaign. A cricket match between two teams - 'No Honking 11' and 'Road Safety 11' - was held to drive home the message. "We are making every effort to reduce noise pollution in Mumbai. Besides sportspersons, we will involve people from all sections of society in this drive,'' Fadnavis said.
