 AGRA: Bodies of a couple were recovered from their house in a remote village of Agra on Saturday. The deceased have been identified as 30-year-old Bacchan Singh and his 28-year-old wife  .
  
  According to police, prima facie, it appears that Singh had smothered his wife to death before hanging himself at their residence in Nibari village on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.
  
  “The initial probe suggests that Singh was an alcoholic and the couple often engaged in an argument. On the fateful night, Singh may have killed his wife in a fit of rage and later hanged himself,” Dauki police station officer Tejbahadur Singh said, adding that the bodies have been sent for post-mortem.
  
  At the time of the incident, Rekha was sleeping in a separate room with her three-year-old son Vimal, while Singh sent their seven-year-old son   and three-months-old daughter Shagun to watch television at their uncle’s home. The two children later slept there. On Saturday morning, when Singh’s nephew   went to call him, he found the two bodies in the room, while   was crying.
  
  The villagers immediately called the police, who broke the door of the room and recovered their bodies.
