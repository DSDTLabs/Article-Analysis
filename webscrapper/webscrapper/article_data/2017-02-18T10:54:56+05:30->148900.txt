BERHAMPUR:   is set to form a zilla parishad in Ganjam, the home district of chief minister  , with the regional party claiming to have secured 42 of the 69 zones in the district by the end of the third phase of the three-tier panchayat polls on Friday. 

 The election for 47 zilla parishad zones were completed by the third phase, while two polls will be held in two more phases in the district on February 19 and 21. 
 
 Of the 47 zilla parishad zones, BJD secured 42 zones, while BJP and   zilla parishad candidates won in four and one zone, respectively, as per unofficial reports. 
 
 While the BJP has improved its previous tally, the Congress's performance has been poor compared to last time. In the panchayat elections held in 2012, the BJD had won in 61 zilla parishad zones, while BJP and Congress won in two and four zones, respectively. The CPI candidates had elected in other two zones. 
 
 The BJP has doubled its position so far, while none of the CPI candidates have won in this election so far. "We have already got an absolute majority to form the zilla parish by the end of the third phase elections," said BJD's district president and MLA (Aska) Debaraj Mohanty. 
 
 "If the trend continues, BJD is likely to better its previous tally this time," added Subash Moharana, the party's former district president and chairman of the   (BDA).
 
 "Our position may improve further by the end of the fifth phase of the election," claimed BJP's state secretary Bibhuti Jena. The saffron party may try to reach double digit at the end of the rural polls, he said. 
 
  committee president Bhagaban Gantayat said they would review the cause of the party's debacle in the district. Brundaban Khatei, the party's sole candidate, won from zone 8 (Kukudakhandi block) under Digapahandi assembly constituency. This zone earlier belonged to former minister and senior party leader Surya Narayan Patro.
