GURUGRAM: A German Shepherd dog was allegedly stolen from the house of an elderly couple in   village, Sector 73. Inderjit Singh, the dog’s owner, filed a police complaint on Sunday after procuring CCTV footage of the ‘dognapping’. 

 Singh, a doctor, said that he bought the dog named  , around a-year-and-a-half ago, for Rs 25,000.
 
 Pluto went missing on February 9. When Singh and his wife could not find him, he examined the footage of a CCTV camera in front of his house. It revealed a white car approaching his farmhouse at 10.06pm on February 9, he wrote in his police complaint. 
 
 Pluto was outside at the time. Some men came out of the car, forcefully pulled the dog inside the car and fled away, Singh alleged.
 
 Singh told police he tried to retrieve the CCTV footage as evidence, but couldn’t since the footage has been “locked”.
 
 For the next few days, he tried to trace the dog, and finally filed a complaint at   police station on Sunday, after the footage could be retrieved. Based on the complaint, an FIR was registered at the same police station under Section 379 (theft) of the IPC.
 
 According to the police, the footage is not very clear and doesn’t exactly show the dog being dragged into the car. Investigating officer   said, “Light from the opposite direction has rendered the footage hazy and dark. It’s not clear whether the dog was pushed inside forcefully. We have registered an FIR and are probing the matter.”
 
 Dog thefts are not uncommon in Gurgaon. Several pet owners worry that these are perpetrated by a pedigree dog breeding racket.
