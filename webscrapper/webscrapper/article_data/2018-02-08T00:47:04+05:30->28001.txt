Vijayawada: Newly appointed executive officer of Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Varla Devasthanams, M Padma, who said her focus will be on streamlining the temple’s administration, has proposed performing pujas as per suggestions of the Vedic committee. 

 The Temple Trust board, in a meeting held at administrative office in Jammu Dhoddi in One Town, on Wednesday, approved a few key changes in various pujas performed at the temple.
 
 Padma, along with trust board chairman Gouranga Babu, addressed the media after the meeting, and said that the trust board has approved to provide two special darshans in a year for donors who contribute above Rs 1 lakh. A special identity card will be given to these donors, Padma said.
 
 “Proposal for reducing Antharalya Darshan ticket from Rs 300 to Rs 250 has been sent to the endowments department and the state government for approval, and we hope it will be implemented soon,” she said.
 
 Special pujas will be held at the renovated Shivalayam in the temple from February 24, and devotees will be allowed to take darshan from February 26, said Padma.
 
 The trust board approved to change the venue of Aksharabhyasam, Annaprasana and others to the mandapam near Nataraja Swamy temple, said Gouranga Babu. Proposals for diverting queues through Mahamandapam are under process, and special sheds will be constructed in the temple in view of the summer season, with the support from donors, he said.
 
 “Many vendors near the temple are taking advantage of the devotees’ sentiments, and are selling pieces of cloth as sarees, and the management will take stringent action soon,” he said.
 
 Padma said a detailed study will be done on parking problem in the temple and necessary measures will be taken.
