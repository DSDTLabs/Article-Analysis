Bathinda: The Shiromani AkaIi Dal (SAD) has accused some Congress leaders, including Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal’s close relative Jaijeet Singh Johal, of mocking the Dalits at Manpreet’s office here during the fast kept by Congress workers on April 9. Former Akali MLA Darshan Singh Kotfatta and Bathinda mayor Balwant Rai Nath showed a video clip where Congress leaders were allegedly seen mocking Dalits and making remarks about their skin colour.

 They have asked Congress leaders to apologise for laughing at Dalits. The Akalis have also decided to lodge a complaint with the Punjab State Commission for Scheduled Castes to take action against those mocking Dalits. Congress leader Ashok Kumar, who is alleged to have made the remarks, also belongs to SC community.
 
 Kotfatta, who is also SAD’s Bathinda SC/BC unit head, and mayor Nath told newspersons on Wednesday that, “Our sentiments have been hurt with the Congress leaders making fun of the community and talking about the colour of their skin, which is highly unfortunate. We want them, including Jaijeet, to tender an apology or else our party will raise the matter with state SC commission.”
 
 On the other hand, Congress leader Ashok said that he also belonged to the Dalit community and could never dream of making remarks in bad taste. He said it was only a joke and he had already apologised for that.
 
 Meanwhile, Jaijeet said that, “We were only joking and there was no intention of making remarks in bad taste. Moreover, the party man who made remarks also belongs to the SC community and he has already apologised for that. I too am ready to apologise if the joke made between friends has hurt sentiments of anyone. Ashok has already sent his apologies to the entire community and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and also to Manpreet. It was purely unintentional.”
