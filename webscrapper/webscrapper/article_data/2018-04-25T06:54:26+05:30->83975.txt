MIDNAPORE: The CPM-led Left Front won’t boycott the panchayat polls, said CPM state secretary SurjyaKanta   on Tuesday. He also termed the   and BJP as twin enemies.

 Putting at rest murmurs about a poll boycott, Misra made it clear to party cadres at workers’ meetings in West Midnapore’s  , Debra and   that leaving the fray was not an option. “Reach out to the villagers. And, in areas where no Left candidate is in the fray, look out for that candidate who can defeat Trinamool and BJP. It doesn’t matter which party that candidate belongs to, whether Congress or PDS or any other. We will support and help him or her to defeat the Trinamool and BJP candidates,” Misra told CPM workers.
 
 The CPM state secretary said, “The BJP and RSS are gaining ground because of the Trinamool. Hence, to curb the BJP’s influence we need to defeat the Trinamool.”
 
 Later, Misra told reporters at Belda that a boycott would be counterproductive as it would leave the fight open for Trinamool and BJP. “We are against giving way to the Trinamool and BJP. We have made this clear to our party workers and supporters,” Misra said.
