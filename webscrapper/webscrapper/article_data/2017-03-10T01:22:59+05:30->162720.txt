Gurgaon: Two persons were booked on Wednesday for duping an elderly man of Rs 2.5 lakh on the pretext of investment in insurance policy.

 In his complaint filed at the DLF 2 police station in December last year, sixty-year-old Jai Parkash Gupta, a resident of Sahara Grace Society in Sector 28, alleged two men called him in August and September last year regarding investments in insurance policie. The two men lured him with benefits worth Rs 11 lakh, however, they were soon untraceable after Gupta transferred money. 
 
 A probe by the economic offences wing (EOW) confirmed the allegations after the complaint was forwarded from DLF 2 police station. 
 
 Following EOW’s recommendation, police have lodged an FIR under section 420 (cheating) of the IPC against the accused on Wednesday. 
 
 “We have found that Gupta transferred the money to an AXIS bank account in Baliya of Uttar Pradesh,” said ASI Vinod Kumar, the investigating officer.
