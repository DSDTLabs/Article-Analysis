SHIMLA: While normal life is still out of gear in   following the recent snowfall and restoration of electricity and water supply is yet to be made in the affected areas, warning of rain and snow from Sunday till Wednesday at many places of the state has been issued. With this, trouble is set to mount for the residents as it would stretch the wait for regular supply of electricity and water.

 According to   officials, heavy rain and snowfall is likely to occur at isolated places of middle and high hills on Sunday and Monday. From Sunday onwards, lower hills and plains of state would receive rain and thundershower at many places. 
 
 On Saturday, Shimla recoded maximum temperature of 8.7 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature of 0.5 degrees Celsius, Dharamshala recorded maximum 14.2 degrees Celsius and minimum 7.4 degrees Celsius temperatures, Keylong in Lahaul-Spiti recorded maximum minus 2.9 degrees Celsius and minimum minus 13.9 degrees Celsius while Kalpa town of Kinnaur district recorded maximum 5 degrees Celsius and minimum minus 6 degrees Celsius temperatures.
 
 In Shimla, frozen pipes and erratic power supply has made life miserable for residents. Though, irrigation and public health minister Vidya Stokes recently claimed that water supply has been restored but frozen pipes are not allowing the water to flow to the households.
 
  (HPSEBL) is struggling to restore power supply as it has suffered huge loss due to snowfall and the coming snowfall would pose further challenge to the department to carry restoration work.   deputy director Anurag Prashar said that by Friday, out of 667 damaged transformers in Shimla, 585 were restored. He claimed that remaining 82 transformers would be restored by Sunday evening. He said power supply has been restored in other most snowbound areas of the state and the remaining areas too would be provided the supply at the earliest.
