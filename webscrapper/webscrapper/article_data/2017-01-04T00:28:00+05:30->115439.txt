Imphal: After the Union home ministry sent a report to the   Commission of India (ECI) seeking a deferral of the assembly election in  , chief minister   Ibobi Singh and his cabinet colleagues on Tuesday air-dashed to New   to lobby against any postponement of polls.

 Sources said the ECI wrote to the chief secretary about the concerns raised by the home ministry. Taking serious note of both the report and the letter, Congress Legislature Party convened an emergency meeting on Tuesday morning with Ibobi Singh in the chair. Soon after, the chief minister, his deputy Gaikhangam, some ministers and senior Congress legislators flew to the national capital on different flights, the sources added.
 
 The chief minister will contact both President Pranab Mukherjee and top ECI officials and ask them to conduct the polls on time.
 
 The ongoing law and order crisis in Manipur took a turn for the worse after the United Naga Council (UNC), which had imposed a blockade on the national highways of the state from November 1, intensified its stir in reaction to the cabinet’s move to create seven new districts — Kangpokpi, Jiribam, Pherzawl, Noney, Tengnoupal, Kakching and Kamjong — on December 8.
 
 Besides imposing the blockade on the Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Jiribam highways, UNC had also picketed state government offices in the Naga areas of Manipur over the past couple of days. On Tuesday, Naga protesters stormed the mini-secretariat in the Senapati district headquarters at 11am, forcing police to fire teargas shells and mock bombs. Around nine protesters, including women, were injured and taken to the nearby district hospital.
 
 The blockade entered its 63rd day on Tuesday and the prices of key items remained prohibitively high. President of UNC Gaidon Kamei and information secretary SK Stephen, who were arrested by the state police in Pheidinga on November 25, are currently in police custody.
