New Delhi:   stressed the importance of internal democracy in the party on the first day of his two-day Pravas, which is part of his nationwide tour, in the city on Friday. The observation comes in the backdrop of growing factionalism in Delhi BJP and some allegedly working against its chief Manoj Tiwari. 

 Shah is upset over the functioning of the state unit and the recent reports about factionalism, said a party member. A senior leader said Shah gave a strong message that factionalism won’t be tolerated. 
 
 He held at least 10 meetings with office-bearers and other party members, including senior leaders who are not holding any post. He also met the newly elected councillors. 
 
 Calling himself the “biggest” example of the party’s internal democracy, Shah said, “I had no political background. I started as a small party worker and became the party president because our party has internal democracy. Our leader ( ) is also an example of it.”
 
 In the present scenario, only two parties still have internal democracy, claimed the BJP president. “BJP and the communist party still have internal democracy intact. It’s finished in all others. I can say this after carefully studying the system. Some parties give preference to family, some to caste and others have limited themselves to state-level  .” 
 
 Taking a jibe at Congress, Shah said, “Can you tell me who will be the BJP chief after me? Now, can you tell me who will be the   president after Soniaji? If dynasty, instead of merit, is the benchmark in a party, it can never take the country forward.”
