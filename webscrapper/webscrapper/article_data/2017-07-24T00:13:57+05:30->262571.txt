Altercations and misunderstandings between actors, be it in showbiz or on the small screen, is common place. But in a first, the Kannada television world witnessed a physical fight, and that too one where an actor ended up biting his co-actor. Sounds bizarre? We’ve got all the details and the pictures, too.
 On Saturday, the cast and crew of the serial  , were dumbfounded when an argument broke out between its two lead actors   and   Ponnanna. Readers may recall that the two were participants in last season of   wherein they didn’t see eye-to-eye. To add to it, a rumoured love triangle that involved another contestant,  , added to the already thick plot.
  Sources from the set say that both Bhuvan and Pratham didn’t exactly share a rosy relationship even when the serial went on floors. The duo have had a difference of opinion on many occasions, some which even made it to the headlines.
  Last weekend, however, their fight took one of the most unexpected turns that saw Pratham biting Bhuvan. A viciously wounded Bhuvan, we hear, retaliated and landed a few punches on Pratham. “We don’t exactly know what transpired between them, but the talk is that Pratham made a few lowly remarks about Sanjana after she refused to hold his hand for a scene. The disparaging comments he made were apparently about Sanjana and Bhuvan. Bhuvan made a few sharp observations and tried to put Pratham in his place and that’s when the fight took an ugly turn,” says a source from the set who adds that there were many folks who witnessed these proceedings. After having punched Pratham a few times, Bhuvan then proceeded to get medical treatment at a neighbouring hospital. BT was also privy to the information that Bhuvan ended his association with the serial on Saturday.
