NEW DELHI: The   (IFC), the  's private investment arm, on Thursday pledged to invest $ 125 million in equity to fund   built by   (HFE).
 
 This deal between IFC (and the IFC Global Infrastructure Fund) and HFE comes at a time when the Narendra Modi government aims to increase India's renewable energy production capacity to 175 GW by 2022.
  
 HFE Chairman and Managing Director   said.his company's goal is to achieve 2.7 GW renewable energy capacity by 2020.
  
 Most of the money HFE has raised will be invested in wind and solar projects, with solar projects accounting for 70% of the funds, Munjal said.
  
 HFE's chief executive officer Sunil Jain said the company will focus "aggressively" on expanding its rooftop solar portfolio. 
  
 Company sources estimate that over 1 million households will benefit from IFC's investment in the next 25 years, assuming that a single household consumes around 1500 units annually.
 
 Investments in renewable energy are crucial at a time when accelerated climate change figures among the greatest threats facing humankind. 
 
 In October last year, India ratified the historic Paris Climate Change Agreement. Its greenhouse gas emissions account for 4.1% of the global total, but it has pledged to produce - by 2030 - at least 40% of its electricity through means that don't involve the burning of fossil fuels.
