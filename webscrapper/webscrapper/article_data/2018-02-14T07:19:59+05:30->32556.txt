AHMEDABAD: A   (PV),   has failed to restrain a city-based company   from using  , as a local court rejected to stay the latter from using the trademark.

 Navitas claimed that the trademark was registered in the UK in 2006, and an application for registration in India is pending. The trademark is used for various services made available to the members of PVNET in the sphere of pharmacovigilance. The company has been using trademark since 2004, and its total revenue in 2015 was Rs 7,387 crore, and net profit was Rs 699 crore.
 
 Navitas alleged that Sarjen too started using PVNET in 2012 and by misusing the goodwill of Navitas, the latter may eat into the profits by taking away business in India. Since PVNET is a registered trademark for Navitas, Sarjen should be restrained from using it for its products, software or any other goods or services in the field of pharmacovigilance.
 
 An amicable settlement between the two was not possible out of the court, and   approached IN Registry against Sarjen using the trademark. The Tribunal asked Sarjen to transfer the domain name, but the issue reached the Delhi high court and is pending at present.
 
 Meanwhile, Navitas approached a civil court in Ahmedabad and demanded a stay on use of word PVNET by Sarjen, which put up its defence by saying that there is a legal battle going on with regard to domain name pvnet.com. Sarjen also submitted that both the companies operate in different sphere of economic activities and there is no likelihood of any sort of confusion. Sarjen began using this trademark in 2008-09, and Navitas was not so visible in India then.
 
 The court concluded that Navitas failed to supply documents that it had its presence visible in India when Sarjen started its operation in this field.
