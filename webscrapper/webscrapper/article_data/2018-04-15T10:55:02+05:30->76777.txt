THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   here on Saturday stepped up his attack against the   government over the Varapuzha custodial death case by demanding   or judicial commission probe into the police excesses.

 “Chief minister took three full days to react to the gory incident. Instead of trying to safeguard police for all its brutalities, the chief minister should take the force to task. Who gave permission to Ernakulam rural SP to run a Rural Tiger Force on his own? There is no legal footing for such a special force under the SP. Nobody believes that state police’s investigation would bring the real culprits before the law. If a CBI investigation is not possible, the government should seek the service of a serving district judge for a judicial inquiry into the custodial death of  ,”   said.
 
 The law and order maintenance system has been terribly eroded due to the politicization of the police force, by the CPM. “Police act only upon the instruction of CPM leadership. They arrest people as per the list given by the party. Experienced officials are side-lined. The special team of Ernakulam SP did not follow the   guidelines to be observed by police while taking a person into custody. The formation of the special team itself was against law and there was a standing instruction by the police chief against setting up of such teams. Police have charged murder case against unidentified persons. This is a clear move to save police personnel responsible for the custodial death,” he said.
 
 The opposition leader said he would giver a letter to the chief minister demanding a CBI/ judicial investigation.
 
 Chennithala also demanded financial assistance of Rs 25 lakh to the family of Sreejith and asked the LDF government to take steps to provide government job to Sreejith’s wife.
