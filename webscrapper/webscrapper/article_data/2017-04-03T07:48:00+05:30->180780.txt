Gurgaon: Two men on a bike duped a woman and took her gold bangles after pretending to be police personnel on Saturday evening.

 Kamlesh Mehta, a resident of Maple Heights, in Sushant Lok 1 was walking back from the market around 7 in the evening, when two men on a bike approached her.
 
 The men asked her why she was wearing gold bangles in public and that she should keep them in her bag.
 
 Mehta ignored them initially, but the men pestered her saying they were concerned for her safety. So Mehta relented and took off her bangles.
 
 While Mehta was going to keep the bangles in her bag, one of the bikers gave her a piece of paper, saying she could wrap the bangles in that paper and keep them. Mehta followed their instruction.
 
 After reaching home, Mehta realised that her bangles, four of them, were missing from the bag, instead, three fake bangles were wrapped in a paper and kept in the bag.
 
 According to Mehta, when the two men were helping her wrap the bangles, they switched the packets without her noticing it, and it was only after reaching home she realised what had transpired.
 
 An FIR has been registered against the two men in the Sushant Lok police station under sections 406(punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420(cheating) and 34(act by several people for common intention) of the IPC.
 
 The investigating officer ASI Rakmuddin of the Sushant Lok police station said the police are scanning the CCTV camera footgae around the area to gather more clues about the accused. "We are in the process of getting a sketch prepared with the help of the information the complainant gave us," he said.
