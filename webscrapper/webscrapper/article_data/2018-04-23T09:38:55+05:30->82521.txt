BENGALURU: There are few better hitters of a cricket ball than   and fewer better to watch in the middle. And while the South African went about his business against  , scoring in the only way he knows how (an unbeaten 39-ball 90),   had the best seat in the house. 

 
 “What should I say about AB? I feel lucky and blessed to be playing with him. It was one of his best innings, but then AB is AB, he keeps doing this every 3-4 days...,” said Mandeep, who was at the non-striker’s end as RCB clinched a six-wicket victory over DD on Saturday night.
 
 
 
 
 
 “When he is batting, our job is very simple because he is so good. Whenever I bat with him I just try to rotate the strike. Also, he doesn’t feel all the pressure when he is batting.”
 
 With RCB’s batting largely revolving around the performance of ABD and captain Virat Kohli, Mandeep feels such focus is only natural.
 
 “When you have two of the best batsmen in the world, then it’s understandable that the focus, and the expectations, are on them. But that will be the case with whichever team they are in. But then, we are not overly dependent on them, we also try to chip in and do our best,” he said. 
 
 For the struggling Delhi,   continued his good form with a 48-ball 85 and took his tally to 223 runs from five matches. While ABD’s rambunctious show may have overshadowed his innings, Mandeep gave the Indian youngster his due.
