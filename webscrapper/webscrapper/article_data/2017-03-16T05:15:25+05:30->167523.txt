IMPHAL: Footballer-turned-politician   was sworn in as the first BJP chief minister of Manipur on Wednesday and the party’s third CM after the ones in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in the Northeast.

 Singh was given oath of office by governor   at   here. Outgoing CM   blessed Biren, once his trusted lieutenant. State Congress chief T N Haokip also attended the ceremony.
 
 Prominent BJP officials, including Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar, power minister Piyush Goyal, Assam CM   and party general secretary Ram Madhav were present.
 
 BJP chief Amit Shah could not attend the ceremony as the aircraft he boarded had developed a snag. He spoke to Biren over phone to congratulate him.
 
 Seven of the eight ministers who were sworn in belong to allies. Four are from National People’s Party (NPP), one each from Naga People’s Front (NPF) and   (LJP). 
 
 One switched over to BJP from Congress. Biren appointed NPP legislator and former DGP Y Joykumar Singh as his deputy. Others inducted were L Jayanta Kumar Singh, Letpao Haokip and N Kayisii (all NPP), Losii Dikho (NPF), Karam Shyam (LJP) and Congress ‘defector’ Shyamkumar Singh.
 
 This was probably the first time an MLA-elect from an opposition party, Shyamkumar, was inducted as a minister in a ruling coalition.
 
 Biren told reporters that his government’s priority would be to lift the United Naga Council-sponsored economic blockade, which has held the state hostage for over four months. “I appeal to the brothers and sisters of UNC to lift the blockade on humanitarian grounds. We can sort out our differences, but innocent people should not suffer,” he said at a rally near the party headquarters.
 
 In a bid to counter criticism on accepting NPF in the coalition, Biren said, “From today, Manipur is united. The BJP-led alliance has Nagas, Kukis, Pangals (Manipuri Muslims) and Meiteis.” Meanwhile, Congress expelled Shyamkumar from primary membership.
