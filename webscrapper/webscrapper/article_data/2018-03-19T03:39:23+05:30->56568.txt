BHOPAL: A protein-rich breed of chicken, popularly known as ‘Kadaknath’, has virtually become a bone of contention between   and   states, with both staking claim over its nativity.

 
 The two neighbouring states have filed applications with the Geographical Indication registry office in Chennai to obtain the ‘GI tag’ for this blackwinged chicken variety. ‘Kadaknath’ is known for its high iron content and much lower cholesterol than other breeds, and sells at a much higher price than other varieties, say experts.
 
 “Madhya Pradesh is likely to get the GI nativity tag for the tan-blooded bird, which has its origin in the state’s Jhabua district,” MP animal husbandry department’s additional deputy director Dr Bhagwan Manghnani said. “The Gramin Vikas Trust of Jhabua applied for the GI tag in 2012 on behalf of the tribal families involved in breeding it,” he said.
 
 Chhattisgarh too staked its claim for the GI tag of ‘Kadaknath’ recently. Global   (GBIPL), Chhattisgarh, chairman Srinivas Gogineni said the bird is reared in the state’s   district in a unique way, and in a homely atmosphere.
 
 GBIPL has been roped in by the Dantewada district administration for helping the tribals in livelihood generation in the area, under the public-private partnership model.
 
 “The Dantewada administration, while taking assistance of the   and Industry, an industry body, applied last month for the GI tag owing to the uniqueness and high production of   in the district,” Gogineni said. 
 
 The chicken is reared in a natural environment in Dantewada and not fed with ready-made fodder, he claimed. The state government-supported self help groups of tribal women, running over 160 poultry farms in Dantewada, are engaged in the production of about 4 lakh chickens of the variety for meat annually, Gogineni said.
 
 Meanwhile, Manghnani said the government-run hatcheries in Madhya Pradesh produce about 2.5 lakh chickens of the Kadaknath variety annually.
