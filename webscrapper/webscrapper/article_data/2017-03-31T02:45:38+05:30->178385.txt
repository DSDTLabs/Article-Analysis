NEW DELHI: Weeks before Prime Minister   completes three years in office, information and broadcasting minister   has written to various Union ministers and other senior   leaders to compile the government’s achievements and communicate them effectively to the people.

 “We need to transform ourselves into mission mode to present to the people the three-year report card ... we must prepare concrete action plan and be ready with facts, figures, data to propagate the government’s achievements in a big way,” Naidu said in a note addressed to the ministers.
 
  members Chandan Mitra and Swapan Dasgupta have been assigned the task of directing the intellectual discourse and counter any possible negative narratives on issues like less than promised employment generation; inconsistent performance of core sector; ‘so-called’ threats to freedom of expression; slow progress of next generation reforms; and no significant breakthrough in improving ease of doing business.
 
 Citing BJP’s victory in the recent assembly polls, Naidu said the “mood of the nation is clearly in favour of BJP and PM Modi”.
 
 “Three years in office is fairly a reasonable period for the people to form an opinion on our government and judge our governance impact on their lives,” he said adding that the government’s relentless pursuit to turn around the fortunes of millions of people, hitherto neglected by successive governments, had started bearing visible fruits.
 
 The government has drawn up a list of ministers who would prepare note on specific sectoral topics assigned to them.
 
 Minister of state for external affairs M J Akbar has been tasked with highlighting the positive outcomes of the PM’s foreign tours.
