PHAGWARA: Former   (SAD) MLA  , who had joined BJP in December 2016 during the run-up to assembly elections, joined   (BSP) on Thursday, , saying he was upset with the   government’s alleged anti-poor and anti-Dalit policies. 

 Mohan was welcomed into the party by BSP’s state affairs in-charges Megh Raj Singh and M L Tomar and state chief Rashpal Singh Raju. Several BSP leaders were present on the occasion. 
 
 Giving his reasons for the switchover, Mohan said the Union government was working against Dalits and minorities and that was his main reason for joining the BSP. “The party is also becoming a major hope for the people to stop the anti-Dalit and anti-minority agenda being pursued by BJP,” he said.
 
 He is the son of former BJP minister  , who was among the first Dalit leaders of BJP in Punjab and a minister in the SAD-BJP governments in 1997-2002 and 2007-2012. Mohan was the MLA from Banga from 1997 to 2002 and 2007 to 2012. When SAD denied him ticket in 2002, he contested the election as a BSP candidate ticket but again returned to the Akalis.
 
 Mohan had joined BJP on December 21, 2016 during the state-level rally held by the party’s scheduled caste wing in  . He was an aspirant of BJP ticket from Phagwara in place of sitting MLA Som Parkash, who had displaced his father in 2012. He owes allegiance to Parkash’s bête noire former   chief Vijay Sampla. However, Parkash managed to retain his ticket and seat also.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Megh Raj said, “Now people are seeing the possibility that BSP can play a crucial role in scuttling the making of Hindu Rashtra by forging alliance with like-minded parties.” 
 
 Mohan’s joining is being seen as attempts of BSP leaders to strengthen the party as leaders are hopeful of forging an alliance this time in Punjab, which was earlier ruled out by party supremo Mayawati and performance of the party kept on sliding.
