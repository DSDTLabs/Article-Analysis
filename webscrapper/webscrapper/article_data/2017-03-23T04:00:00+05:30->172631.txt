PepsiCo is yet to resume operations in its plant in Tirunelveli, despite a High Court ruling on March 2, which lifted the ban on use of water from Thamirabarani river.

 “Our plant in Tirunelveli was shut down for over 6 months and the operations on the plant are yet to resume. We are working with the relevant stakeholders to resolve the issues and resume operations soon,” said a spokesperson from PepsiCo India. The firm bottles drinking water Aquafina and manufactures Quaker oats out of the plant. 
 
 The company, along with Coca Cola, faced a temporary ban on drawing water from the Thamirabarani River over allegations of exploiting the river water. In November 2016, The Madras High Court had initially gagged both the companies from drawing water, after a PIL was filed against them. The ban has since been lifted.
