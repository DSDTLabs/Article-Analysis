 Mumbai: Responding to a TOI report carried on September 22 that   chairman emeritus   could emerge as the largest shareholder in the company should it default on dividend payments for two years or more, Bombay House officials emphasised on Friday that preference shareholders getting voting rights in the event of such a default was provided for under Section 47 of the  .
 
 They also pointed out that the holding company of India’s largest conglomerate had not defaulted on dividends in the last many decades. The report had said that a two-year default could give Tata, who holds 10.5 lakh preference shares, a voting stake of 31.43%, former Gujarat Ambuja promoter   17%, and  , a trustee of Tata Trusts, 7.78%.
 
 A senior group executive said a “routine corporate action” should not create a “misleading impression” that the resolution at the Tata Sons AGM on Thursday was “guided by the motive” of making Tata the largest voting shareholder in the company when it was merely “a legal consequence that necessarily flows under the law”. “It is a matter of law, not a matter of choice,” he added.
