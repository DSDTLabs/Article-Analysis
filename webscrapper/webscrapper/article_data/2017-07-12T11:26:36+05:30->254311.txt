Actor Vivien Leigh’s copy of the “Gone With the Wind” script is going up for auction alongside many of her items from her personal collection.

  Sotheby’s will offer paintings, jewellery, books, clothes, belonging to Leigh at an auction to be held on September 26 in London.
 
  Vivian Leigh won the Academy Award for her iconic role of Scarlett O’Hara in the 1939 movie 
 . The sale will include Leigh’s personal copy of the original novel with an inscription pf a poem by author   herself. The book carries an estimated price tag of 5,000 pounds to 7,000 pounds.
 
  The script of the movie, presented to the actor by her co-stars, is priced at 2,500 pounds to 3,500 pounds.
 
  Harry Dalmeny, Sotheby’s U.K. chairman, said that the collection offers a glimpse at the private Leigh, “a fine art collector, patron, even a bookworm.”
 
  Leigh died in 1967 and the collection is being put up for auction by her grandchildren.
