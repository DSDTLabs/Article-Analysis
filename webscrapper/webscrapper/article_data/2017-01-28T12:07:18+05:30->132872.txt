RANCHI: Chief minister   on Friday directed all   to expedite the implementation of projects that were announced during last year’s  .

 In a review meeting with the secretaries of all departments in Project Building, the chief minister instructed the departments prepare a ledger of the projects that would be beneficial for the state and table them before the Union finance ministry for approval of funds.

 In its action taken report (ATR) on last year’s budget speech, the Das government claimed to have implemented 135 out of 172 new projects and schemes. While one scheme was suspended, 37 are yet to be implemented. The opposition parties were critical about the ATR and accused the Das government of not being able to fully implement the 135 announcements. 
 
 The CM in his meeting also stressed on the need to end red-tape and said government officers would be held accountable for not completing their work on time. 
 
 “The responsibilities of the officers and the staff should be fixed, team spirit needs to be promoted and all departments must have healthy competition among themselves,” Das said.
 
 The CM came down hard on the energy department for pilferage of electricity as the state currently suffers AT&C losses to the tune of 32%. 
 
 In a press release issued by state development commissioner   after the meeting, the government stated that the review meeting also focused on the preparations of the upcoming global investors summit which is scheduled for next month.
