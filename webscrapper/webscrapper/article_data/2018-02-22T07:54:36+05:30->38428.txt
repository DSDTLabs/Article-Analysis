SECUNDERABAD: The Centre has sanctioned total 44 km survey of two long flyovers that have been proposed to bypass the railway traffic load at   and   stations.

 Maximum trains under the zone touch on these two junction stations every day, thus paving the way for railway traffic snarls more often than not. Hence, it is likely that the construction of these flyovers will ease the flow of trains. One   has been proposed between   and  , while the other will connect Guntakal West with Malappa Gate.
  
  
 A railway official told TOI that apart from the congestion at home signals, reversing engines at Vijayawada and Guntakal for other directions wastes lot of time and delays the running schedule of trains. “Once the flyovers come up, we shall be able to bypass the trains, which will no longer need to change positions of engines. Besides, trains will run at their usual speed through the upcoming corridors.” 
 
 Tracks from five directions converge at Vijayawada and Guntakal. The trains, which are not scheduled to stop at the two stations, will bypass them with the help of the flyovers. Officials have been entrusted with the survey and on the basis of the estimation to be submitted with the Centre, the railway board will allocate money.
