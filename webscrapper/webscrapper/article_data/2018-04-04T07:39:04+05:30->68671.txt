CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister   unveiled a campus of IIT-Delhi at Sonipat Technopark on Tuesday, calling it yet another step of his state government towards the development of youth and creating employment opportunities in the state. 

 Accompanied by Union minister of state for human resource development Satya Pal Singh, Khattar said the technopark cost the state government about Rs 175 crore.

Apart from this, Vishwakarma Skill Development University is being set up in Palwal,” he said.
