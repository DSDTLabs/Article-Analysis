CHENNAI: The   on Tuesday directed the   (I-T) department to file a response to the plea moved by Sun group chairman   assailing an order passed by the department declaring him as principal officer of SpiceJet. Such a finding by the I-T department would make him liable for the alleged tax dues of the company.

 When the plea came up for hearing, senior counsel P S Raman submitted that Maran had not signed a single document on behalf of SpiceJet filed with the I-T department. This apart, he was only the non-executive chairman of the company who has no say in the day-to-day activities of the firm. Such affairs, including issues pertaining to taxes, were managed by a full-time managing director of the company. The managing director had himself written to the department explaining the facts, while so, how can Maran be declared as the principal officer and made liable for the tax dues of the firm, Raman wondered. Opposing the contentions, additional solicitor-general G Rajagopalan argued that the department had reasons to believe that Maran was in control of the company. Moreover, the office which has passed the order and the registered office of the company are in Delhi. The petitioner has also approached the Delhi   seeking to quash the order and hence this court would not have territorial jurisdiction over the issue, he added. 
 
 To this, Raman said: “The petitioner resides in Chennai. The notice and the final order of the department were served to him at his Chennai address. Therefore, this high court has territorial jurisdiction over the matter.”
 
 In his affidavit, Maran had submitted that the company was in severe financial crisis, and as one of the promoters, he had infused over Rs 245 crore from his personal funds and another Rs 144 crore from his other company Kal Airways.
 
 Recording the submissions, Justice M Duraiswamy posted the plea to March 6 for further hearing.
