MUMBAI: The state housing department has received 650   and   to its   for the implementation of the   (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). The rules are requisite to implementing the RERA Act. The last date for the submissions was extended from December 23 to December 31.

 A housing department official said a single official will scrutinize the responses received. “There is no provision for a public hearing, so it may not be held. Also, we do not know how long it will take to scrutinize all the inputs received,” said the official.
 
 Activists have accused the state government of drafting rules that favour builders though the Central Act has been framed to protect consumers’ rights. 
 
 The housing regulatory authority is to be set up before March 31. Former bureaucrat   has been appointed as interim regulator.
