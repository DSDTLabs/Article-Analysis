PANAJI: The fisheries department has failed to implement the ban on bull or pair trawling and the use of light emitting diode (LED) lights despite investing crore of rupees on a patrol vessel, Ave Maria-14, for inland and sea water patrolling.

 All   general secretary and vice-chairperson of the National Fishworkers’ Forum   said that the state had imposed a ban dated May 10, 2016, after a state-level agitation at Panaji and Betul. The central government had also issued an identical order dated November 10, 2017. “But rampant violations continue in territorial waters and the Indian Exclusive Zone (EEZ),” he said.
 
 The competence of the crew on Ave Maria-14 is doubtful, said All Goa Fishermen Union president  . “Despite complaints, no action has been taken on violators till date,” he alleged.
 
 The LED lights, mostly 1600watts to 5000watts and powered by additional genset/generator, attract fish, including juvenile fish, from upto 5km. “The use of LED lights will destroy marine ecology,” he said.
 
 The traditional fishermen have extended a seven days’ deadline to enforce the ban.
