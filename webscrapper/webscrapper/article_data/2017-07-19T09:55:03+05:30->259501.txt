NAGPUR: Curiosity and greed got the better of 26-year-old Rajendra Choudhary, a carpenter, who is now behind bars for stealing Rs 45,000 cash and two mobile phones from the ninth-floor penthouse of Indian fast bowler   on Monday .

 Choudhary was arrested by the Ambazari police from Seoni in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday and the stolen articles and cash - totally worth Rs1 lakh - recovered from him. Yadav used to reside at Impressia Rise Apartment at Shivaji Nagar. Choudhary was traced as he had not switched off his mobile.
 
 Police said that Choudhary scaled the pipe from the eighth floor, where he was employed for doing interior work, to land at Yadav's house. On Monday, Yadav, who had come to Nagpur for a short visit before the tour of Sri Lanka, was out of the house with his wife and mother-in-law from 7pm to 8.30pm.
 
 That was when Choudhary struck. The cash belonged to Yadav's mother-in-law and one of the mobiles was of his wife.
 
 Yadav alerted the police control room at 3am. Ambazari police registered an FIR late on Tuesday as Yadav left for New Delhi in the morning.
 
 According to police, Choudhary had told his friend that he had peeped into Yadav's house a few times earlier too just to have a glimpse of him. After getting to see him once, Choudhary got encouraged to try again.
