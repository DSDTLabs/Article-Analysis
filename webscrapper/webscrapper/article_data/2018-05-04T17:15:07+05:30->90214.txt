NEW DELHI: A 14-year-old boy died after he fell from a flyover in GTB Nagar on Wednesday evening. The incident happened during the dust storm and cops are also probing if he fell due to the force of the wind. Family members of the deceased suspect foul play.

 Police said that the matter was reported around 8.30pm, when they received two PCR calls from the spot simultaneously, stating that a boy had fallen off the flyover. Soon after this, a police team went to the spot and the boy was taken to the hospital where he was declared brought dead.
 
 The boy was identified as Love Sharma. 
 
 DCP (Shahdara) Nupur Prasad said they are probing the case. The boy went to the flyover on his cycle and fell down. “The family members suspect foul play in the case, which is been investigated,” said the DCP. Another senior police officer said that the family members also suspect that he might have been pushed by someone.
 
 Pravesh, Sharma’s uncle, said that the boy told his sister that he was going outside on his cycle. “We got a call from police and they told us that my nephew was admitted at a private hospital after he fell from the flyover,” said Pravesh. “He had died by the time we reached there,” he added. The relative also said that the injury that the kid had received in the head raises suspicion.
