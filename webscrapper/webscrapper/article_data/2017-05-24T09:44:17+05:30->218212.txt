SHIMLA: Coming out against Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana,   finance minister claimed that the scheme benefited only private empanelled companies instead of targeted farmers.

 Addressing media persons in Shimla, Manpreet said Punjab government would apply to Government of India to float its own   company for the benefit of farmers. He said the profit earned through crop insurance would be used to help farmers in distress.
 
 He said the Congress had promised the same in its manifesto during Punjab assembly election and would promise the same for farmers in   ahead of upcoming assembly election.
 
 Highlighting the plight of farmers, he said 35 farmers are forced to commit suicides every day in country. He said the condition of farmers in India is not good and is evident from the fact that despite comprising 62% of India’s population, their contribution to GDP is only 13%.
 
 He said NDA regime headed by   has written off Rs 1.54 lakh crore loans of businessman but has denied farm loan waiver for debt-ridden farmers of the country.
 
 He alleged that BJP government was not deliberately procuring farmers’ crops even at the minimum support price. He said on the one hand, BJP government buys less wheat from India’s farmers, on the other it imports wheat by reducing import duty from 25% to 0%.
 
 He said despite successive droughts over the past three years, BJP government has willfully failed in providing calamity relief to different states.
