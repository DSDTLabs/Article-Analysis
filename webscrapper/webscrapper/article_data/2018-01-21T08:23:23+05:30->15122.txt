BENGALURU: The   fire, which was doused following a marathon 30-hour operation, became a political flashpoint between the  ,   and the JD(S) on Saturday with the three parties blaming each other for failing to protect the waterbody and Bengalureans.

 While the BJP took potshots at the Congress by describing the lake's deterioration as a "man-made disaster caused by inaction over the past 50 years", the latter retorted stating the Modi-led government at the Centre has refused to give funds to rejuvenate the lake. The JD(S), meanwhile, mocked both the parties stating: "Bellandur Lake frothed when the BJP was in power and it is on fire when the Congress is in power."
 
 Politicians from different parties rushed to the spot to send across 'we-care-for-the-lake' messages in the run-up to the assembly elections. The first salvo was fired by the BJP when it slammed chief minister Siddaramaiah for splurging public funds on poll campaigns while citing a cash crunch when it comes to improving the condition of Bellandur Lake. Alleging that the government was in sleep mode and had not utilized central funds worth Rs 162 crore released for constructing four sewage treatment plants at the lake, the BJP said Siddaramaiah will wake up to the problem only when the froth and stink reach his residence.
 
 The Congress decided to apply brakes on the BJP's tirade and rushed Bengaluru development minister   and mayor   to the lake to oversee the fire- control operation.   stated: "The opposition's claim that the Centre has released funds for cleaning of Bengaluru lakes and our government has not done anything about it is a blatant lie. The fact is that the Centre has not responded to the state's request and has categorically denied separate funding for this purpose." The minister maintained that the   (BDA) has undertaken de-weeding and related activities at Bellandur Lake using its own resources.
