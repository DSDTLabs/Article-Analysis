NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   may have the mantra for breaking "silos" of individual departments for team work, but bureaucrats and departments are trying hard to protect their turfs. 

 In a recent example, both   and finance ministry have said they should have the power to appraise   under the proposed Bharat Mala programme, which will cover nearly 30,000 kilometers with an investment of at least Rs 3.5 lakh crore.
 
 Sources said the   had circulated a Cabinet proposal for the next generation avatar of Vajpayee's   programme. It had proposed to go back to Vajpayee era when NHAI Board was delegated the authority to appraise and approve individual highway projects after the Cabinet gave one time go ahead for the entire highway development programme. 
 
 NHAI Board had secretaries of finance, economic affairs, highway ministry and the erstwhile Planning Commission. But this was changed during UPA and almost all individual projects went through layers of appraisal and finally were to be put before Cabinet for approval. 
 
 TOI has learnt that during a recent meeting convened by government's think tank Niti Aayog, both finance ministry and the Aayog had views tat they should appraise and approved the projects. South Block has even gone to the extent of saying that since simply because its secretaries are members of the NHAI Board, it does not have any role in appraising and approving works. 
 
 This paper has also learnt that to address these observations, Transport Bhawan is reworking the composition of NHAI Board by incorporating Niti Aayog representative and a couple of independent board members. 
 
 Quick appraisal and approval of highway projects are required to push award and ultimately the construction of highways to push pace of road construction. The government has been struggling to cross 20 kilometer per day record against the target of building 40 km daily.
