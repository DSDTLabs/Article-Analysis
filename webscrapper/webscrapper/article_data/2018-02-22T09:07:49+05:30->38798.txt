HUBBALLI: If you are riding to a fuel station in the twin cities to tank up your bike, ensure you are  . Otherwise, you won't be allowed a refuel. 

  As part of their drive to bring at least 90% of the 4.5 lakh two-wheelers in the twin cities under the helmet rule in the next few days, the Hubballi-Dharwad   will launch the no-helmet-no-fuel campaign on Thursday. Only 30% of the riders in the twin cities wear helmet, a police source said, adding the drive will go on till full compliance is achieved. 
 
  The department has put up banners and posters at the 68 fuel   in the twin cities as also at vantage points, informing riders that fuel won't be sold without a helmet. Deputy commissioner of police (crime and traffic) BS Nem gouda told TOI they held meetings with bunk owners and 14 two-wheeler   in twin cities . "We've urged showrooms not to deliver a new two-wheeler without a helmet and also do not accept bike-service requests if there's no helmet. Likewise, we've asked the road transport authorities not to register bikes whose owners do not have a helmet," he said. 
 
 One police officer will be deployed at each petrol bunk to bring the situation under control if the rider picks a fight with bunk staffers over denial of fuel. All stations and showrooms have been aligned on the drive.
 
  "We are visiting schools and colleges to drive home the message," police said.
