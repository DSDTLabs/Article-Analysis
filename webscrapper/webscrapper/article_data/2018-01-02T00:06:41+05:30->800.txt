Coimbatore: On Monday, a group of students from the department of costume design and fashion at Kongunadu Arts and Science College, along with the members of the Rotary Club of Kovaiputhur, turned up at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (Cmch) and distributed clothes to the infants at the maternity ward. Some of the students, who started distributing clothes to the mothers, also put the clothes on the babies with the help of the mothers. They had stitched around 400 clothes for 200 babies in three days, taking time off from their class hours, using the raw materials provided by the Rotary Club. “This is a new experience for me. I have never visited this hospital before,” said a faculty member of the college, who had accompanied the students. The brain behind the initiative, city-based social worker Anandatheerthan, said he had been distributing clothes for the infants at the hospital for the last 10 years. “I co-ordinate and get in touch with people, who can give funds and those who can put in services,” the 69-year-old man said. So, what prompted him to launch such a drive? “Almost a decade ago, on a December day, when I walked into the maternity ward of Cmch, I saw the baby, to whom I had arrived to donate blood to, laid on a torn rag. When I asked why the baby was laid on a torn rag, its mother said she had no money to buy clothes,” he told TOI. The sight of the newborn unclothed in winter prompted Anandatheerthan to try his best to cloth the unclothed infants on the New Year’s Day. For this, he tirelessly seeks out benefactors and volunteers. “I have roped in several schools, colleges, self-help groups and NGOs for this,” Anandatheerthan, who also works for the betterment of under-privileged and tribal people, said. This is how he brought together Devadas of Rotary Club of Kovaiputhur, who, through the organisation, sponsored the clothes, and the students and faculty of the college.
