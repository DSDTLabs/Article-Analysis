ARA: Banks in   district have so far received only 324 applications under the   scheme, which is a part of CM Nitish Kumar’s seven resolves, launched on   in 2016.

 Out of 324 applications, 252 applications have been accepted by the banks and 233 applicants have been given the card, but only 119 applicants have been sanctioned the loan amount.
 
 This fact came to the light at a district-level bankers’ committee meeting held at the   auditorium on Tuesday, which was presided over by Bhojpur DM  . Expressing dissatisfaction over the tardy progress of the scheme in the district, the DM asked the manager of the district registration and counselling centre, which conducts the scheme to coordinate with the banks.
 
 The DM also asked the officials to talk to the eligible applicants and launch an awareness campaign in the coaching centres in order to increase the number of the applicants and gave instructions to expedite the disbursal of the loan amount among the applicants.
 
 The manager of the district registration and counselling centre has also been asked to submit a list of the prospective applicants, who have been contacted and counselled.
 
 Even chief minister   had accepted in the assembly on Tuesday that demand for the student   card scheme was not as popular as the government had expected. The student credit card gives students from weaker sections aspiring for higher education, up to Rs 4 lakh with the government acting as guarantor for the return of loan and interest.
