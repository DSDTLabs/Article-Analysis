Rajkot: Six persons were booked for cheating a farmer of Rs 25.98 lakh by posing as employees of a mobile phone company wanting to erect a tower in Rajkot. 

 The FIR was lodged by Milan Dhoniya (22) against Suresh Bharadwaj, Abhishek Sharma, Sanjay Singh, Manish Singh, Prashant Singh, and R D Sharma. Dhoniya alleged that the accused had published an advertisement in a local vernacular newspaper two months ago stating that they were employees of telecom company Aircel and wanted land to erect a mobile tower in Rajkot city.
 
 According to the police, Dhoniya contacted Bharadwaj and Sharma saying that he had big chunk of land which could be used to erect the mobile tower. The accused duo told Dhoniya that he will have to pay Rs 25.98 lakh as service charge and deposit for his company to go ahead with the project.
 
 Dhoniya was asked to deposit the amount in bank accounts of Sanjya, Manish and Prashant, which he did. But after getting the money, all the accused disappeared. And after searching for them for over a month, Dhoniya approached the police and lodged FIR with Bhaktinagar police station. Police have issued look-out notice for the accused.
