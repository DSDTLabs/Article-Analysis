BENGALURU: The annual Open Day, organised by   (IISc), saw thousands of visitors, mainly children, on its otherwise quiet campus on Saturday. The event, which takes place every year, commemorates the birth anniversary of JN Tata, founder of the institute. 

 “This is the third year that we’ve attended the exhibition and my daughter absolutely loves it. She’s only 12 now, but she wants to be a scientist when she grows up, and events like these encourage her further,” said Meera R, who was accompanying her daughter.
 
 Visitors could watch rocket demonstrations, enjoy the interplay of music and flames in Ruben’s tube (an apparatus to demonstrate the wave-like nature of sound), ride a bicycle that turns in the opposite direction to the handles, and even try sample ice cream made using liquid nitrogen.
 
 Additionally, they could participate in quizzes and competitions like the egg-chute, in which participants were asked to safely land an egg, using a parachute.
 
 Drone race and chocolate shower
 
 In the roto lemon-n-spoon race, organised by the aerospace engineering department, participants had to guide drones through six arches and ultimately land them on the launchpad, without dropping the lemon from the spoon attached to the drone. 
 
 Nandan G A, a third-year aeronautical engineering student from   managed to complete the circuit in 26 seconds. “We found out about this event only the night before, so we couldn’t even practise much,” he said.
 
 Another participant,  , a BSc student from  , cleared the course in 29 seconds. “I’ve been working with unmanned aerial vehicles for the past six years. I built and programmed this drone myself,” he said.
 
 Halfway through the event, the organisers surprised the younger spectators, showering them with chocolates from a drone. Visitors could also participate in quizzes and competitions like the eggchute, in which participants were asked to safely land an egg using a parachute.
