NAWAMSHAHR: Close on the heels of the   shifting 12 SSPs in Punjab ahead of the  , two activists have alleged in a letter to the poll panel that the state government had adopted a “pick and choose policy” for postings of SSPs in Punjab. They have claimed that 5 PPS officers were still posted as SSPs despite EC’s directions that IPS officers should be holding the charge of the districts. 

 “The Punjab government in contravention of the instructions issued by the Election Commission, instead of posting IPS officers, has posted PPS officers as a senior superintendent of police in some districts. Roopnagar, Gurdaspur, Barnala, Khanna and Jagraon districts have PPS officers as SSPs,” said the complaint sent by activists   and Parvinder Singh Kitna to EC, including chief election commissioner Dr  .
 
 “Even some IPS officers been entrusted command of various districts are considered close to ruling parties. The factum of their closeness with ruling parties can be well imagined from the fact that a case (CWP 13203 of 2013) is pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court. In this case, it is alleged that some   officers had been promoted as IPS by adopting illegal ways. It appears that in the transfer orders of some police officers on January 6, 2017, the criteria of seniority and performance could not be taken into consideration, rather junior officers having close proximity have been posted as SSPs by adopting the policy of pick and choose (SIC),” they alleged, while mentioning that in the last elections one of these officers, a relative of a top leader of the ruling alliance, was transferred on the recommendations of election observers.
 
 “Some honest, impartial and daring officers have been kept away from election duty. Some officers who got commendation letters from election observers in the last elections have been sidelined now,” they said, seeking immediate intervention of the EC into the matter.
