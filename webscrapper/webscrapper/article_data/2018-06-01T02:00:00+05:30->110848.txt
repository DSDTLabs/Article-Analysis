PATNA: The   (RLSP), an ally of the ruling NDA, on Thursday expressed concern over the loss suffered by JD (U) candidate Murshid Alam in Jokihat bypoll. The RJD has wrested the assembly seat from JD (U) by a huge margin of 41,225 votes.

 
 “The results of the bypolls are a matter of concern for the BJP,” said Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) national general secretary and spokesman Madhav Anand. “It is high time for the   to sit together with all its allies and formulate a common strategy for the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP should respect all its allies and take them into confidence because they are quite depressed and feeling isolated by today’s results,” Anand added.
 
 The interesting aspect of the RLSP’s response was its praise for the RJD and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “I congratulate   and the RJD for winning the Jokihat assembly seat. We respect the mandate given by the people of  ,” Anand said. 
 
 However, the JD (U), BJP and LJP have underplayed the loss of the NDA candidate in Jokihar bypoll. The JD (U) has dismissed the Jokihat result as indicative of the reigning hold of late   and his family on the constituency. Shahnawaz Alam, younger son of Taslumuddin, won the seat on the RJD ticket, while elder son Sarfaraz Alam, who is in the RJD, represents the Araria Lok Sabha constituency. It is another matter that Sarfaraz won the Jokihat assembly seat for the JD (U) in the last four assembly elections.
 
 The BJP was more dismissive of the Jokihat result. “It will have no impact. A win in the bypoll is not of much consequence. Local factors become more important in the bypolls,” health minister and former state BJP chief Mangal Pandey said.
