CHANDIGARH: Taking note of the serious failure of   government in carrying out investigations into the breach of  , near  , at the peak of the pro-Jat quota stir in February 2016, Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday handed over the probe to CBI.

 HC passed these orders while observing that the incident was a serious threat to “critical national infrastructure. Supply of water via Munak canal, which covers 60% of Delhi's population, had remained suspended for around two weeks during the agitation. The court has also stayed the trial of the cases related to the incident and asked the CBI to take over the matter and complete the probe “as expeditiously as possible.“
 
 A division bench, comprising Justice S S   and Justice  , passed these orders while hearing the ongoing petition related to failure of law and order machinery in Haryana during the Jat stir.
 
 While sending the matter for CBI probe, the bench reite rating the findings of Prakash Singh committee in its orders, “What happened to the Munak canal points to a grave internal security threat to India's critical national infrastructure. If a group of agitators could stop an important source of water supply to the national capital, what could a determined group of terrorists do is rather discomforting to imagine.“
