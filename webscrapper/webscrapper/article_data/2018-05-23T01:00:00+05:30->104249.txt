ARA:   (VKSU) vice-chancellor   who resigned on Monday evening, cited lack of conducive atmosphere in the varsity for doing productive work.

 However, sources said the immediate trigger was the ongoing tussle of different students’ bodies over the right to use the students’ union office on the varsity campus. 
 
 “There was a tussle for the students’ union office located on the university premises. ABVP, which bagged all the five key central panel seats in the union election held in February, did not allow AISA and other students’ union leaders to sit in the union office. This often led to altercations between the AISA and ABVP members. This as also a major factor behind my decision to resign. Several union leaders even talked to me in an undignified manner on the issue,” said   after tendering his resignation.
 
 “Frequent agitations by students and non-teaching employees also took a toll on my health. I was finding it difficult to focus on any productive work due to frequent disruptions. Though I worked very hard for the all-round development of the university, I had to deal with frequent disturbances on the campus, which is indeed sad,” added the ex-VC.
 
 Meanwhile, VKSU Students’ Union president and ABVP leader Amit Kumar Singh said, “The VC’s resignation is not a solution. He is an honest and hardworking person and he should try to solve the problems of the students as and employees. The students’ union will stand by him if he needs our cooperation.’’
 
 AISA Bhojpur district Secretary Sabir expressed similar opinion. “Resignation cannot be the solution to any problem. The VC should meet the students to find out their worries and address the issues. AISA has been demanding an office for the university and college representatives. The VC should make arrangements for it.’’
 
 Incidentally, Mumtazuddin had offered to resign in November 2017 also citing personal reasons but it was not accepted by the Chancellor.
