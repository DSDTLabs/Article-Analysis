MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday directed the   to   permission to the organizer of   to hold the event on January 21, subject to payment of Rs 1.05 crore as fee to BMC.

 The interim order was passed by a bench headed by Justice Abhay Oka who also directed the BMC to consider the request of the organizer to put up stalls for providing medical assistance and to serve water and refreshments to participants.
 
 Last year, the organiser,   International, had moved court, challenging the exorbitant charges for the marathon. Procam’s advocate said that while it had paid Rs 23 lakh to the BMC last year, the civic body is asking it to pay Rs 3.66 crore this year. “While we want the permission for just seven days, the BMC is charging us for the entire month. We are merely trying to organize sports events for the public. But the BMC is saying that it has a share in our revenues,’’ he argued.
 
 Senior advocate  , representing BMC, said the civic body routinely charges for the entire month irrespective of the duration of events and that the fee is decided as per valid rules and resolutions. Giving an example of a railway pass issued to commuters, Apte explained, “Even if one travels for just 10 days a month, the commuter is charged for a minimum duration of an entire month.’’ He also said the marathon is not “a mere sports event” and has become a “full-fledged commercial activity”.
 
 The bench then directed that as an interim measure, the BMC must grant permission for the event if Procam paid Rs 1.05 crore — Rs 79 lakh as security deposit and Rs 26 lakh towards advertisement fee and other charges, by January 15. The BMC has also been directed to submit a copy of the general resolution deciding the advertisement rates.
