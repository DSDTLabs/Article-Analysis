KOCHI:   police have filed an FIR against   for promoting enmity among different groups on religious grounds.

 Nandakumar, who was an employee of a private bank in Kochi, had posted a derogatory comment on social media against the eight-year-old who was raped and murdered in Kathua, and was dismissed from service reportedly after a social media uproar.
 
 The case has been registered under Section 153 A of the IPC for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.
 
 The man had reportedly justified the gangrape and murder of the girl in Kathua on Facebook.   had posted on   that “Ivale ellam ippozhe konnathu nannayi… allenkil naale Indiaykku ethire bomb aayi vannene” (Better she was killed now itself, otherwise she could have come with a bomb against India tomorrow).
 
 Panangad sub-inspector   said that the accused was at large. “The man and his family were missing since the social media outrage. The FIR is under a non-bailable offence and a search is on to trace and arrest him,” the inspector said.
 
 A mass social media campaign erupted after the comment was made, with the man later posting excuses claiming that his comment was taken out of context.
 
 However, the social media relentlessly campaigned, tagging the bank and asking the bank authorities to dismiss him. Later, the bank responded on social media, condemning the post and stating that the man was no longer an employee.
