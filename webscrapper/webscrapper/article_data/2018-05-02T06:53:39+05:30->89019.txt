BENGALURU: Aditya Bharadwaj suffers from dyslexia, which makes it difficult for him to take down notes like other students. However, that did not deter him from delivering a stellar performance. He scored 94.4% in II PU exams and is among the 18 students in the state to bag a centum in psychology.

 Aditya is among 597 students with dyslexia — a learning disorder characterised by difficulty in reading — who wrote the exams this year. Of them, 324 passed. The 17-year-old boy who wrote the exams with the help of a scribe, scored distinction in all the five papers he attempted. Besides 100 in psychology, he bagged 96 in sociology, 92 in economics, 88 in history and 96 in English. He was exempted from writing another language paper.
 
 
 Aditya aims to clear the UPSC exams and wants to join the  . His mother   said his success in II PU was largely because of the guidance of the teachers at Jain PU College. “We noticed his condition when he was four. He studied in a special school till Class 10. Shifting to a mainstream college should have been difficult, but it wasn’t for Aditya as the faculty was encouraging and he didn’t face discrimination,” said Sushma. He has a problem in writing, not learning, she added. Notes provided by his peers came in handy.
 
 Sudha V Rao, principal, Jain PU College, said students with dyslexia got ample support from teachers. “We would call them separately and clarify their doubts. Students with dyslexia are slow learners. But we as teachers treat them on a par with other students,” she said.
