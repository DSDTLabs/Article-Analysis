MUMBAI: The online assessment process seems to have picked some speed. Monday saw about 4,000 faculty members report for online assessment. When the working day closed, the army of teachers had assessed a whopping 50,000 answer books.

 While mid-July is closing in, assessment looks far from completion. The Examination House put out data on the progress across streams. Close to 60% assessment in technology was completed, 45% in science and 35% in commerce, which has the largest pool of candidates. 
 
  “The teacher turnout has improved and we feel that if everyone works like this together we will be able to bring out the results soon,” said Deepak Wasave, controller of examinations. But that was not the case till last week and one is not sure how the rest of this week will pan. Only 20% of the total teachers who have been registered for the online assessment landed up at the assessment centres after evaluation work began last week.
 
 However, experts said given the pace of assessment it is a Herculean task .
 
 According to a July 7 circular issued, of the total 11,807 teachers who were registered to start the online assessment only 2,794—23% reported to work last week. The circular urged principals of all the colleges and directors of management institutions to ensure that all their registered staff is reporting to the paper correction CAP centres for assessing the papers. Officials from the higher and technical education department said that these numbers may look like a lot of faculty members have not started assessing the papers, but they have also received many complaints from faculty members of not being able to log in to the system for correction. “We have received complaints from principals saying that their staff could not log in to the system despite being registered. There are also complaints that the assessment process is complicated,” said an official.
