GHAZIABAD: The district administration and police on Tuesday issued a set of   to all   schools for the safety of children, three days after a 6-year-old girl was crushed to death by her own school bus in the city. The administration issued directions that school safety committees be formed in all educational institutes to provide a safe and secure learning environment for students.

 In a meeting held with representatives of all   in the district on Tuesday, the administration issued a direction that the guidelines be fully complied within seven days.
 
 “These are basic ‘indicative guidelines’ which should have full compliance. Schools can take several further steps to provide foolproof   to students,” said district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari.
 
 The administration has directed schools for mandatory police verification of all Class IV employees, including drivers and conductors of buses. It recommends separate toilets for boys, girls, school staff and visitors, besides compulsory identification cards for all employees. Installation of CCTV cameras have been made mandatory to cover every single area of school premises.
 
 “Special watch needs to be kept on swimming pools and buses. Police will help schools in conducting verification of employees,” said Ghaziabad SSP Hari Narayan Singh.
