He says, "I had always been surrounded by aunties like Pammi Aunty when I was in Delhi. That is how I created the character.

 "I grew up in Kamla Nagar and later shifted to Punjabi Bagh. I did my schooling from Modern School, Barakhamba Road, and then moved to Australia for graduation and post-graduation," he says, adding, "I do not have any favourite places as such, but I grew up eating chhole bhature from   in Kamla Nagar. Even now, whenever I pass by that shop, I ensure that I eat there."
