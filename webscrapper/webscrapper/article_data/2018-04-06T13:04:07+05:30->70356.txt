Horror seems to be the flavour of the season. After ‘Kaya’, ‘Pari’ and ‘Jojo’, three films that revolved around supernatural elements, it’s now the turn of ‘Hoyto Manush Noy’ to scare the audience.

 After releasing the first song a few days ago, here comes another lively and soothing track from this   and Arunava Gangopadhyay directorial. The soulful ‘Megher Kole Rod Heseche’ has become an instant hit.   and   has rendered the track and presented it beautifully for the anthological horror.
 
 The film is reportedly about five people leaving office in a midnight cab. One thing leads to another and they began telling stories about supernatural events, stories of spookiness that eventually keeps them enthralled. The stories go beyond their boring corporate chitchats and make the cab ride a journey of a lifetime.
