 “Programmes, recordings and pictures taken during Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s visit to Netaji Bhawan in 1969 will be added to the archive. We have already digitized all significant letters and papers of the pre-Independence period,,” added Bose.
 
 All orations by stalwarts at Netaji Bhawan since 1961 will be made available on the archive. “Most of the speeches have already been published in various journals. We plan to archive them now in a digital form and put them online,” Bose said.
 
 The historian-turned-MP also pointed out that along with the digital archive, conservation work has been done on all historical items stored at the museum. “They are already on display at the museum. The clothes, which include kurtas worn by the great leader and his shoes, have been restored with the help of Intach,” said Bose.
