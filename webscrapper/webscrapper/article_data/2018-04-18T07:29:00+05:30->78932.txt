Manali: After claiming to be the first town in the country to ban plastic two decades back, Manali is going to be a zero-honking zone. The administration has started widespread awareness campaign to stop honking here. Locals and tourists are being educated not to use their horns. A special traffic awareness week is also being organized. 

 After a cycle rally on April 10, to spread the message of “no honking” in the township, local bikers took out a rally on Tuesday to spread the same message again. In the next step, senior citizens and students will hold a rally. “No honking” campaign will continue throughout the month.
 
 Manali sub-divisional magistrate Raman Gharsangi said transport department officials will hold meetings with taxi, auto and other transport unions to educate them about traffic rules and encourage them to make the town zero-honking zone. “Mother Nature has gifted immense beauty to Manali but we are facing a new problem of sound pollution. I have called a meeting of other departments and stakeholders on April 20 to frame further strategy (to stop honking),” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Kullu administration is starting a road safety week from April 23. The district administration will organize programmes with a different theme every day. Earlier, a special campaign to check all school buses was undertaken in the district from April 16 to 22.
