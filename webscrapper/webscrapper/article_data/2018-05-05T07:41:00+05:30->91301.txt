Ludhiana: A drunk man killed his two-year-old son at Jassian village near here on Friday evening by ramming his head into a boulder and then repeatedly hitting a stone on his head. 

 It has been alleged that Chota Ram, who works as labourer, continued to hit his son, Moti Babu, even after his death. Police are yet to find out why he killed the child. 
 
 The family hails from Bihar. As the crime took place near a rail line, government railway police (GRP) have arrested and booked the accused. 
 
 The deceased boy and his nine-year-old sister were playing outside the hut in which the family lived, while the mother and two other daughters were cooking dinner inside when Ram picked up the boy and took him to the rail lines.
 
 As an onlooker saw Ram kill the accused, he raised the alarm. Villagers then informed the GRP. Ram was arrested soon after. The body has been sent to the civil hospital here for the post-mortem. 
 
 A GRP official said they were yet to find out the motive behind the killing. “We are recording his statement,” he said. “He did not kill him over a marital discord. Ram was upset over some other reason.”
 
  The family had been living in the area for four years.
