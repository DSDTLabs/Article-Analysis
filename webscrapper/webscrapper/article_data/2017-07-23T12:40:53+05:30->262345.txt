NASHIK: The state on July 15 asked the   (NWDA) to prepare a detailed   (DPR) for two intrastate river linking projects. 

 The two projects include Damanganga-Vaitarna, which will benefit Sinnar, and Damanganga-Godavari to benefit other parts of Nashik district.
 
 A letter issued by state to NWDA said that the   (WRD) will initiate further action of according the administrative approval and sanction of budget for the preparation of DPR. "While this will take some time you (NWDA director) are requested to take up the work of preparing the DPR," it stated.
 
 "After our sustained follow up of the matter with the state, the latter agreed to carry out a detailed report for both projects at Rs 42.15-crore expenditure. When complete the projects will bring 12,000 million cubic feet of water into Godavari basin," said Member of Parliament Hemant Godse.
 
 This is the best thing happening for the drought-affected  , which also houses a major industrial area. 
 
 "Interestingly, Nashik did not find space in Phase-I of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) because of lack of water. It was surprising that   was chosen as it is more drought-prone than Nashik. However, we kept the demand for the intrastate river linking project that will save water flowing down the hills into the   in the west," Rajendra Jadhav, from the Nashik-based NGO, Jalchintan, said.
