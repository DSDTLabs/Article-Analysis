NEW DELHI: With   completing three years in power in February,   is planning a campaign to highlight what it describes as the ruling party’s “failure” to deliver on it poll promises. A meeting of Delhi BJP’s core group was held on Wednesday in this regard.

  chief   said: “Three years is a substantial time for a government to deliver on its promises. During assembly elections, AAP had made 70 promises. We will tell the people how they have failed to deliver on their promises. Our workers will hold demonstrations at the ward level to tell people about how the AAP government has stalled development work in the city.”
 
 BJP members say that the Delhi government had started with road rationing scheme like odd-even in the first year but till date it has not been able to present a concrete plan to address the pollution problem in the city. “They don’t have any concrete plans. They failed to augment the DTC bus fleet. They are sitting on metro Phase-IV project which is crucial for addressing the congestion problem,” said Tiwari.
 
 The northeast Delhi MP criticised AAP for its health policies, especially the decision to reserve 50% beds in GTB Hospital for city residents. He said that everyone has a right to healthcare services. “There should be no reservation in access to healthcare,” said Tiwari. He also alleged that several hospital expansion projects are pending with the government.
 
 Meanwhile, AAP’s decision to nominate former Congress member Sushil Gupta has given BJP another opportunity to attack them. “The way Kejriwal disregarded his own party leaders and showed arbitrariness in Rajya Sabha nominations, clearly shows he is not a democratic head,” Tiwari said.
