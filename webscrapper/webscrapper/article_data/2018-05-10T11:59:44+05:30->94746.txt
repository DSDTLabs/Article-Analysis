CHENNAI: The Madras   has made it clear that there shall not be any conduct of classes in the 127-year-old Dr Ambedkar Government Law College, Chennai from May 1, except conduct of examinations.

 “It is to be noted that the shifting of the college to two separate colleges is pursuant to the orders passed by this court. Any attempt made to obstruct or hinder the shifting would be in violation of the orders passed by this court. The government is at liberty to fix a date for inauguration of the new colleges, before the commencement of the next academic year on July 9. The entire process of shifting should be completed soon so that the college administration will be able to commence the classes from July as scheduled. If there is any problem in implementing the court’s order or if there is any hindrance caused by anybody, the DGP, the commissioner of police, and superintendent of police of Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram are directed to give appropriate police protection and it is the duty of the police to make sure that there is no obstruction,” a division bench of N Kirubakaran and V Parthiban said.
 
 Noting that it goes without saying that all infrastructure facilities should be available within the college campuses, the bench said, the entry into the colleges should be restricted only to students, administrative staff, teaching staff and legitimate visitors and security arrangements should be provided in such a way as found in the IIT campus.
