Vasco: In six months, Vasco police collected more than Rs 1 lakh by way of fines by booking 541 cases for smoking and spitting in public places in the port town. It is the highest number of cases booked under Section 4 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COPTA) in the last three years, after police inspector Nolasco Raposo took charge here.  Each person booked under Sec 4 of COTPA has to pay Rs 200. From this, the police have deposited Rs 1,08,200 in the government treasury, the highest in three years. Raposo said, “Usually, it is the labour class who are booked in our jurisdiction.” He added, “People spit outside almost all public offices, so in order to discourage use of ghutka we have booked these cases.” While Vasco police has done a commendable job, it seems like it failed to clean its home before clearing out the public nuisance. The corners of the staircase of the men’s barrack at Vasco police station which houses about 60 policemen is in bad shape. Raposo said, “I will certainly check the building and see if there is a mess. We are trying our best to free public places from such messes.” The PI’s cabin is hardly 500m from the barracks.
