CHENNAI: A residents’ welfare association in   is battling against the construction of a CBSE primary school in the locality.

 They say the school does not have the building permissions required.
 
 Greater Chennai Corporation had, in a letter dated December 30, 2016, issued a stop-work notice to the promoters of Sri Chaitanya Techno School in DC Kothari Nagar in Ramapuram.
 
 “No approved plan has been exhibited at the site or produced when called for,” the document said.
 
 A zonal-level official confirmed that the civic body had issued a stop-work notice to the school. “The school has, however, made an oral submission to us, stating that they have submitted the school plan details to Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA),” he said. “We are monitoring the issue closely and are likely to issue another notice to them next week.”
 
 When TOI visited the spot on Friday, workers were involved in construction activity amid mounds of cement and gravel. The official said the corporation is aware that work is continuing apace at the site despite its notice.
 
 Sri Chaitanya Techno School assistant general manager B Srinivasa said the application with CMDA is in its final stage and that they are complying with the corporation’s stop-work notice.
 
 DC Kothari Nagar Residents Welfare Association has taken serious objection to the promoters building the school in the area they live — a predominantly residential locality.
 
 “Despite the stop-work notice, construction is continuing at the site,” association president A Paul Dhas said. “This is a violation of rules.”
 
 In response to an RTI petition the association filed with CMDA, the authority said it had received a proposal for construction of the building and the file is currently under scrutiny. CMDA, however, received no proposal for reclassification of the land, it said.
