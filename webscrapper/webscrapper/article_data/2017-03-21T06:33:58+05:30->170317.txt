LUCKNOW: When they had entered the   two years back, they were novices. On Monday, when they turned up in formals and wore their  , the graduating students were all smiles and nostalgic on the last day at the place that was home to them for two years. 

 Crowded at the Bodhigrih quadrangle, they shared last-minute life tips with friends, endless selfie sessions with family and friends. “It is not just students leaving the institute, it’s also us, who would make regular visits to the institute whenever allowed, so we will missed it too,” said Satendra Varma, a parent. 
 
 “I used to pin his handkerchief to the uniform every day till junior classes and now, despite an IIM certificate, to me he’s a child,” said Chandra Pandey, fixing the cape of his son’s robe that was constantly falling off the shoulder.
 
 With the sun shining in their faces, proud parents began to pour in at the convocation grounds, hours before the ceremony began, ready to pose for photographs. As the ceremony began, the walk-way off the stage was crowded with excited spouses, elated parents and toddlers of the graduating students. 
 
 Students were seen taking their parents around the many buildings and hostels on the campus, letting them wander in the food-mess and sit around at their favourite hangout-spots. “The convocation grounds were our favourite spot, besides the mess. Sitting on the steps of this stage, talking till late in the night was a routine we cherished most,” said Sushmita. 
 
 There was no end to selfies and photographs, while another attraction was a special board put up by the managing team displaying the words ‘IIM Lucknow’ and carrying passport-size photographs of all graduating students. As the convocation ended, another special photo booth with balloons and quirky placards reading ‘Proud of you’, ‘IIM graduate’, etc attracted most of the attendees.
