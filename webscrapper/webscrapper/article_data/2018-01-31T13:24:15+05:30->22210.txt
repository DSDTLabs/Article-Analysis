PANAJI: Former union law minister   and   MLA   have demanded chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s resignation over the Mhadei river issue. Alleging that considerable work has been done and canals been built in Karnataka, Khalap said all the efforts put in by the army of Goa’s lawyers and experts “seem to have gone to waste”.

 Mhadei will be the main issue, followed by the issues of coal and nationalization of rivers, at the upcoming   meet in Goa.
