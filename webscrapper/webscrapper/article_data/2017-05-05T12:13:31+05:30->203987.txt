BETTIAH: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the seizure of 4,998   notes (FICN) of Rs 1,000 denomination from one Ekramul Ansari at the Indira Gandhi  , New Delhi, in 2014 and also the subsequent seizure of FICN with Rs 25 lakh face value from a courier company in Raxaul in 2016, on Friday arrested one Abi Mohammad  , bordering Nepal, in   district. The East and West Champaran district police assisted the NIA in the operation. Ansari, carrying a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head, is believed to be a big catch.

 West Champaran SP Vinay Kumar said Ansari, a Nepali national, has Pakistani handlers and the FICN consignments are routed to him for circulation in India from Dubai. He added that Ansari will be produced before the special NIA court in Patna.
 
 While Prashant, NIA DIG in Lucknow, refused to comment on the arrest, police said the joint operation with the NIA was in pursuance to a lead that a cache of high quality FICN of the new Rs 2,000 denomination was feared to be on way from Pakistan via Dubai. “Ansari was caught as he crossed the border to meet his conduits. He was, however, not carrying any consignment of FICN. A cellphone has been recovered from him,” the SP said.
 
 Police sources said the information regarding the duplication of the new Rs 2,000 currency notes make Ansari’s arrest important. His name had first cropped after Ekramul Ansari, resident of Bairawa village near Chandanwada under Dhaka police station in East Champaran, was apprehended at the Delhi airport when he alighted from Dubai with the cache of FICN in 2014. Ekramul and one Sharda Shankar Mahto have been charge sheeted in the case by a Special NIA court in Delhi along with   and two other Nepali nationals – Noor Mohammad and Farmullah.
 
 “Ansari used to receive consignments of FICN from Dubai and his area of operation was Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,” the SP said.
