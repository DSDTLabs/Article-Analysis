CHENNAI: A day after TOI reported that the state government was planning a legislation to exclude the state from the purview of the national eligibility and entrance test ( ), DMK working president M K   on Saturday demanded that the state pass a bill to that effect in the current assembly session.

 In a statement, he said the state should get prior approval of the President for the bill and added that such a bill would help rural students in a big way.
 
 “NEET will affect rural students who want to join   or BDS. As early as 2013, the Supreme Court dismissed NEET stating that it was not needed for medical admission. Each and every state has different needs and students from all states cannot appear for a common all India test,” said Stalin in a statement.
 
 “Our government, between 2006 and 2011, under DMK chief M Karunanidhi, scraped the   for MBBS and BE as rural students were finding it tough to clear them,” said Stalin.
 
 “Education was on the state list till 1976 but it was changed to concurrent list by the Centre. Due to this, states lost their power on education,” said Stalin. But though education is on the concurrent list, the state has power to have an act as in the case of jallikattu issue. “Therefore the state must come up with a bill in the assembly. The government, if needed, can extent the session, but it must definitely introduce the bill and pass it,” the DMK leader said .
