Actor  , who played the lead in the comedy thriller Peechankai, is now doing two films. One of these is a female-centric film, in which he will be seen as a koothu artiste. Says the youngster, “The film’s director, Aadhirai, is basically a writer. It is based on a novel that is set in the 80s, and talks about the medical problems that women face in their lives. Manishajith, who played Sarath Kumar’s daughter in  , and was the heroine in  , plays the lead role.” 

 About his role, he says, “I play a koothu artiste. To play this role, I have been learning the basics of the art form from a troupe in  , where the film is being shot.” He adds that his character appears half an hour into the story, and he is yet to begin shoot for the film, as the role requires him to shave off his beard, which he can do only after finishing his present commitment — a thriller that he is shooting for in Chennai. 
 
 “This film is directed by  , who worked as an associate director in Naan. It takes place in the duration of three days, and touches upon smuggling. I play the protagonist whose life changes in these three days. There will be three to four sub-plots that will come together in the latter half of the film,” informs Karthiik.
