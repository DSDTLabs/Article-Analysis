AHMEDABAD: While the number of outbound passengers from city airport has grown from two million passengers in 2011 to 3.5 million in 2016, as per International   Association (IATA), civil and aviation and other   feel that the city airport is not ready to cater to future demands.

 In his address at the Gujarat Aviation Conclave on Thursday, Amitabh Khosla, country director – India, IATA, talked about the high airport charges and taxation on aviation turbine fuel (ATF). “The value added tax for ATF in Gujarat (30% & 38% for duty paid & bonded ATF respectively according to Gujarat Value Added Tax Amendment Act, 2017) is among the highest as compared to other states, which is not healthy in terms of a competitive price point for fuel,” he said.
 
 Some of the experts present at the conclave also talked about certain inherent limitations of the airport. “The parking space for aircraft is limited at the city airport. Of the total space for some 30 aircraft, four are privately and state-owned aircraft. 
 
 This leaves merely 26   which is not sufficient to cater to the increasing demand,” said  , general manager,   Company Ltd.
 
 Chavda also pointed at the partial taxiway at the city airport, due to which the efficiency in terms of the rapid entry and exit is limited thus affecting the quick movement of flights, especially during peak hours.
 
  At a time when the demand and consumption of the air travel is increasing at the city airport, certain inherent limitations need to be addressed, opined experts.
