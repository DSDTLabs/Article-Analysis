AHMEDABAD: In a rare case, the Gujarat high court on Friday permitted a teacher accused of raping a seven-year-old student to undergo   analysis, brain mapping, and lie-detection tests. The matter arose during the hearing of the bail application filed by the accused, Sunil kumar Damor, 29, the head teacher at a municipal school in   area. He was arrested in September last year on the charges of rape and was also booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

 Damor’s advocate, Virat Popat, argued for bail on the grounds that the complaint was false. He submitted that Damor was innocent and he was targeted because he had refused to honour a recommendation by a local politician to re-admit the victim in the school a couple of months ago. However, the child was admitted later.
 
 In his bid to prove Damor’s innocence, his advocate proposed the truth serum test, brain mapping, and lie-detection test. The HC accepted the proposal and permitted the accused to undergo the tests, Popat said.
 
 Tests such as narco analysis and brain mapping cannot be done on a person without his consent. The   has ruled that if a person is forced to take such tests, it is a violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution which gives an accused the right to remain silent as a safeguard against being forced to furnish evidence against himself. 
 
 Earlier, Dr   from Mandal town had sought narco analysis on himself to prove his innocence in connection with his wife Shiela Soni’s murder. He was denied permission. He was later acquitted of the murder charge by a trial court.
