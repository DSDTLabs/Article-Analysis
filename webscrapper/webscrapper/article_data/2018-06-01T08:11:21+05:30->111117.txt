AHMEDABAD: On Thursday, the standing committee of the civic body approved a payment of Rs 21 crore to a power company, to enable it to move its high-tension lines underground. 

 The decision came under fire from the opposition in the Ahmedabad   Corporation ( ). The standing committee claimed that a split flyover needs to be built over Pallav Crossroads and the high-tension lines need to be shifted underground for that. 
 
 “AMC never paid a power company to take high-tension lines underground earlier. The cost is always borne by the power company. Why is the taxpayers money being used for this purpose? Does the AMC   a utility company for digging up our roads and passing lines beneath them,” asked opposition leader  . 
 
 He also demanded an inquiry into all such payments by the AMC, to utility companies that were not supposed to be made.
