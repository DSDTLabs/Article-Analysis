HYDERABAD/VISAKHAPATNAM: The Telangana government would not take any action against police personnel accused of having links with slain gangster Nayeemuddin based only on photos appearing in the media, home minister   said on Friday. The Congress has however sought a   probe.

 Addressing the media at   in Visakhapatnam on Friday, the home minister said, “We have appointed an inquiry committee. We will not spare anybody, including politicians and cops, if they are found guilty.” The home minister, however, ducked the query on why Nayeem’s diary has not been made public.
 
 In Hyderabad, the Congress targeted the government. Senior Congress leader and ex-MP V   demanded a CBI probe into the alleged links of politicians, police officers and gangster Nayeem who was killed in a police ‘encounter’.
 
 Addressing a media at   here, Rao said only a CBI probe into Nayeem’s death would bring out the facts before the public. He said that though the state government filed an affidavit in court that there was no nexus between Nayeem and police/politicians, media reports pointed to the contrary. He said newspapers have carried photographs showing police officers with the gangster. “The government should order a CBI probe. Otherwise it will be construed that the government is helping the guilty,” Rao said.
