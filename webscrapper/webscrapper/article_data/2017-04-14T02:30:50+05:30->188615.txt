KOLKATA: The eastern zone bench of the   has continued the stay order issued earlier by the Calcutta high court on the state forest department, restraining it from felling trees in the forest land near   in north Bengal. 

 At the NGT hearing on Thursday, the counsel for the state govenrment furnished a permission to fell 3,000-odd trees issued by the divisional forest officer to the  . But NGT refused to take cognisance of this order as the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, requires the Centre to grant permission after a rigorous examination of such applications.
 
 "Building a rail overbridge (ROB) is a non-forest activity. Therefore, it requires permission from the Centre, even if it is deemed a public purpose project," said Siddharth Mitra, counsel for petitioner   and Animal Rights (SPOAR), an environment group based in north Bengal, and Heal India. 
 
 The NGT has directed the petitions to be served on the Central government and concerned ministries Railways, environment and surface transport. "They have to be added as parties and asked to explain within three weeks if any permission was granted," said Mitra. The case will again come up for hearing on May 16.
 
 The proposed ROB on NH 31 near Lataguri that triggered the tree felling drew widespread protests as the area falls under the buffer zone to the   National Park and is a part of an elephant corridor. Also, only one train passes through the area twice a day, holding up the sparse traffic for only a few minutes. 
 
 The rail track, over which the ROB is planned, connects New Mal Junction station with Changrabanda railway station covering a total distance of 61.72 km. Only two passenger trains (up and down) run on the track every day. We had therefore asked government to refrain from building the ROB," recounted SP Pandey of SPOAR.
