NEW DELHI:   has decided to file an   with the information officer of the PMO, seeking details of the process of   made for   for various central schemes and the expenditure incurred. 

 The move to file the RTI was triggered by the lack of response to a letter written to PM’s principal secretary Nripendra Misra last month. According to sources, Sisodia is expected to reach Rail Bhawan, where the PMO is located, by 12pm on Friday. Earlier, he had sought details of social media campaigns for “Make in India”, “Narendra Modi app”, “Startup India” and “Digital India”. Sisodia sought to know who had developed the “Narendra Modi app”, who had the ownership of the app and how much money was spent on its advertisements.
 
 The deputy CM’s letter came 10 days after   registered a preliminary probe against him and others in connection with alleged irregularities in AAP government’s social media campaign “Talk to AK”. Delhi government had refuted the allegations saying that no consultant was hired especially for it. According to the government, through proper tender, a PR company was appointed in June last year to publicise its works for a period of one year while “Talk to AK” was held in July.
 
 In his letter to Misra, Sisodia stated that he wanted to know details regarding central government’s agencies, private advertisement and event management companies, saying that whether bidding process was adopted by the Centre for advertisements for schemes on Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.
