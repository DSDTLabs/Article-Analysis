KOLKATA: The   is taking a number of steps to protect   dumping ground where animal carcasses are brought and buried every day. The civic authorities have already decided not to accommodate dead animals at Dhapa from neighbouring municipality areas. In fact, the   conservancy department turned down one such request that came from south Dum Dum municipality last week.

 
 “We are struggling to accommodate animal carcasses which are brought to Dhapa from across Kolkata. We can’t take more from other municipal areas. This apart, we have to remember the existence of a carcass meat racket operating in the districts close to our jurisdiction,” said a KMC conservancy department official.
 
 
 
  
 
 A conservancy department official said security has been beefed up at the back of Dhapa dumping ground, which shares a porous border with a couple of villages. “This porous border has become a nightmare as the KMC security guards at the dumping ground can’t prevent a section of rag pickers from the locality from entering the area where animal carcasses are dumped. That is why we have decided to intensify the vigil on this particular area ,” a civic official said.
 
 The civic body has also decided to buy bulldozers to ensure that the carcasses get buried deep in the space earmarked for them. “We need to make sure that no part of the carcass stays left on the surface.
 
 The civic body will buy more vehicles to carry the carcasses into the dumping ground.
 
 “Requests to carry carcasses in are increasing. We will buy new vehicles to cater to the increasing demand. These vehicles will be parked at the central garage in Entally and will be pressed into service in areas across the city,” a KMC official said.
