NEW DELHI: Two of the three legal minds consulted by Tamil Nadu governor   favoured a composite floor test to check the contending claims of two AIADMK factions and this prompted Rao to await the   verdict in Sasikala’s disproportionate assets case.

 The SC verdict convicting   that disqualifies her from contesting polls for 10 years has vindicated Rao’s caution against swearing her in as CM.
 
 The conviction and four-year prison sentence attracts provisions of Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, disqualifying Sasikala from contesting a parliamentary or assembly poll in the duration of her jail term and a further period of six years after release.
 
 The governor, in a report to the Centre on Sunday, said that he had secured the opinion of three experts—attorney general  , former solicitor general Mohan Parasaran and former attorney general Soli Sorabjee— on extending invitation for formation of the next government in Tamil Nadu.
 
 Sources said Rohatgi and Parasaran agreed that the precedent from 1998 in UP—when a composite floor test was conducted on the directions of the SC to decide between BJP’s   and then CM Jagdambika Pal—could be followed in Tamil Nadu’s case. 
 
 Sorabjee, on the other hand, said the decision to instal a new government should not be delayed beyond a week and there was no legal hurdle in swearing in Sasikala as the next CM as long as a majority of AIADMK MLAs backed her.
 
 There are still two claimants to the CM’s post and Rao may decide whether to go for a composite floor test to choose between O Panneerselvam and E Palaniswamy or go by the party endorsement claimed by the latter.
