HYDERABAD: Noisy exchanges and thumping of desks marred the debate on the state's   in the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday. 

 With irrigation emerging as a contentious issue over the past two years, the opposition appeared determined to put the government on the mat during the debate. But an even more determined irrigation minister   would have none of that. The   levelled a series of allegations that the TRS government was seeking to take credit for irrigation projects started by the erstwhile   of united Andhra Pradesh. In response, Harish Rao said it was unfortunate that the previous governments did not complete a single project. "It is now up to us to complete the projects and we are doing it," he said.
 
 The irrigation minister also ran through a list of many projects, compared work done during the last Congress regime and the developments on these projects since the TRS came to office. 
 
 One of the most significant exchanges occurred towards the very end of the nearly five-hour discussion. Congress member T Jeevan Reddy said the son of a deceased person can put a thumb impression on behalf of the father on issues related to land acquisition or relief and rehabilitation. "The court will look into this," Jeevan Reddy added. His comments were in response to Harish Rao saying earlier that petitioners who filed cases in the court along with Congress leaders against the government's land acquisition policy, included dead farmers.
