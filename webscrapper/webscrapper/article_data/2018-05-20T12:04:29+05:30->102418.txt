BENGALURU: Two Congress MLAs   and   who had been missing for more than two days, surfaced just in the nick of time.

 
 High drama preceded the return of Patil, who was elected from Maski constituency in Raichur. Around noon, there were reports that two rooms had been booked for him and Singh (Vijayanagara constituency in Ballari), in Hotel Goldfinch, 2km from  . This resulted in DG&IGP Neelamani Raju visiting the hotel to verify whether the two MLAs were being held under duress.
 
 The Supreme Court, while fixing the date for the trust vote, had directed maximum security be given to MLAs for them to vote in a free and fair manner. Congress MLC HM Revanna, who arrived at the hotel to issue a whip to Patil and Singh, was not allowed to go in.
 
 At 2.30pm, there was hectic activity outside the hotel, when Patil, amid heavy police security, was taken to Vidhana Soudha by   MLAs SR Vishwanath and Harish Poonja. DK Shivakumar, standing outside Vidhana Soudha, let him go. Even as he was being taken to chief minister  's chamber, Patil just turned to look back and Congress MLA E Tukaram and MLC Ravi, who were just behind him, grabbed his hand and took him away.
 
 In the assembly's opposition lounge, Patil was given a rousing welcome by Congress members. They asked whether he had had lunch and made way for him to sit. Lunch was ordered for Patil, who dug into the food once it arrived.
 
 Anand Singh's return was rather sedate in comparison. He was reportedly based in a hotel near Vidhana Soudha. Singh, who came to the house around 3.45pm with his wife and son, was escorted by Congress strategist DK Shivakumar into the House.
