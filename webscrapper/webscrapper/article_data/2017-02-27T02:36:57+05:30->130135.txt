Preparations for   actor  's February wedding with   are on in full swing. Neil, who is also a   activist, took a step ahead and instructed organizers not to use any elephants and horses in his wedding procession and use a vintage car instead. Apparently he, along with his family, has taken a stand against cruelty of animals, which is why they'll be entering in a fleet of royal vintage cars. 

 The wedding ceremonies will be taking place in Udaipur from February 6 to 9 at a five star hotel. Since the family wants complete privacy, no non-residents will be allowed in the hotel at that time. The destination was decided when Neil's father Nitin Mukesh was performing at a festival in Udaipur and fell in love with the city. He has already made many trips to the city to oversee all the arrangements of the functions.

 The wedding functions are planned at different venues in the hotel. The entire wedding will be a musical extravaganza, paying a tribute to the legacy of Neil's grandfather Mukesh. 'The pheras and the wedding ceremony on February 9 will take place at the rooftop dome of the hotel, overlooking   and Sajjangarh Fort, since the family wanted to have the ceremony in the presence of all the five elements. The sangeet ceremony on February 8 will see the family's inclination towards music. The songs played will either be Mukesh's or from Neil's movies. Nitin Mukesh will be seen singing Kabhi Kabhi for his son and daughter-in-law to be,' says an event organizer. 
 
 Culinary treats are also being curated by the chefs to serve an exquisite menu, which will have a mix of local specialties and international flavours. Celebrity Italian and Spanish chefs are specially being flown down to create some molecular gastronomy. According to sources, many Bollywood bigwigs, including the Bachchans, are expected to attend the wedding.
