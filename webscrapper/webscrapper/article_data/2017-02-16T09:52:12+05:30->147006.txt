She began her teaching career with the preparatory department and has worked in almost all departments of the college. Dass taught English and geography to the middle and senior school students, and later headed the middle school for nine years. She was appointed the vice-principal in 2012. 
 
 Talking about her vision for the institution, Dass said, “My aim is to take it to greater heights by providing an atmosphere that would enable young girls to be independent, self sufficient, emphathetic citizens, who would contribute to the best of their ability in whatever role they choose to fulfil. I am driven by a desire to see a holistic development of our girls so that they get the best and give their utmost.”
