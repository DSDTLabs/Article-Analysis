HARIDWAR: Administering oath to trainee jail warders at the first convocation ceremony of the 40th Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) Battalion in Haridwar, chief minster   on Thursday stressed on the need to create conducive atmosphere at prisons to reform prisoners rather than only working to ensure security at prisons.
 
  “Effort should be made to create conducive atmosphere at prisons to change prisoners’ heart, mind and behaviour. And that is why the administration is providing yoga training and giving them opportunity for various constructive works,” said the chief minister.
  
  IG (prison)   said, “As many as 187 recruits took part in this convocation parade, while another convocation ceremony will be held at   on Friday, where 183 recruits will participate.”
  
  “After a three-month of professional training, the recruits will undergo practical training for another three months before their postings at prisons across the state,” he added.
  
  Drawing chief minister’s attention to the state of prisons, Prasad said, “For the total 4,400 prisoners in the state, there are only 10 prisons — including a central jail where long-term prisoners are lodged — having a total capacity of 3,700.”
  
  “With the recruitment of 400 jail warders, the jail security has got a big boost as jail warders are its backbone. With over a hundred warders working already, their number has now gone up to over 500,” said IG.
