SAHARASA: The   in   almost came to a halt on Friday as more than 1,500 e-rickshaws remained off the roads. After a daylong strike on Wednesday against the alleged “Tughlaqi farman” of the  , at least eleven   launched an   in the stadium complex on Thursday.

 According to the protesters, the district transport department has been asking them to pay “exorbitant registration fees and penalty with effect from the date of purchase of their e-rickshaws. The amount to be paid is somewhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 per rickshaw. “This is nothing, but injustice. We purchased our rickshaws after taking loans from different financial institutions and are still clearing them back in instalments. Our families will have to starve if the administration forces us to pay such a huge amount,” said Md Shamsul, one of the e-rickshaw drivers on indefinite hunger strike.
 
 The drivers resented the undue interference of the transport department and claimed that in all other districts, including Khagaria, Begusarai, Bhagalpur and Kishanganj, the licence for e-rickshaws were being issued by the municipal councils concerned.
 
 On the other hand, district transport officer Rajiv Kumar, when contacted, refused to speak to this reporter.
