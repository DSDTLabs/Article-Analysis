AMRITSAR: Claiming to have received no official communication so far from the Punjab government about scrapping of the   Act 2016, the university authorities here are set to start admissions for the coming academic year of 2017-18.

 “Till date we have not received any official orders from the government or any other agency stating that the Khalsa University Act 2016, has been scrapped. It’s business as usual for us. Also no orders to stop the admission process for the current academic year have been issued,” said Khalsa University registrar  .
 
 While the official are gearing up for the admission process for the new batches, existing students are in doubt about their academic future.
 
 One PhD student from the university said, “Earlier, the university officials had promised to transfer us under Guru Nanak Dev University ( ). Now the administration has taken a U-turn stating that Khalsa University has not been scrapped.”
 
 The Punjab cabinet had taken a decision last month to scrap the Khalsa University Act 20016, “to save the historic 125-year-old Khalsa   from losing its heritage status by becoming prey to privatization”. Whether the government actually brings in a bill in the assembly to actually implement its decision remains to be seen. The move is likely to affect around 300 students currently enrolled with the university.
 
 An MSc (agriculture) student said, “We have been asked to appear for the examinations later this month, but no clear assurance has been given to us about the credibility of our certificates after completion of the course.”
 
 University spokesperson   said, “We are committed to secure the future of students studying in Khalsa University. However, politics on the issue is causing trouble to students.”
