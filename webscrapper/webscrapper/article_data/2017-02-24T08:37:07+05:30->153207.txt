NEW DELHI: Days after a section of drivers working for taxi aggregating companies went on strike, transport minister   met them on Thursday to listen to their grievances. The minister was sympathetic about their problems and proposed to do away with toll tax at the borders.

 The drivers called off their 13-day strike after Delhi government and the two companies assured them of fulfilling most of their demands.
 
 “The meeting was held at the minister’s residence after members of   complained to him about Uber and Ola not addressing their issues despite high court orders,” said a senior government official.
 
 The official added that the drivers and app-based cab firm representatives came to an “amicable settlement”. A charter of demands was also presented to Ola and Uber officials.
 
 “The companies assured the drivers that they will work on their demands and will give their assurance to the high court on February 28. The firms also invited the drivers to their office to discuss and resolve the issues peacefully,” said a statement from Delhi government.
 
 The proposal to waive toll tax had been made earlier to the corporations, but has not been implemented. “If the proposal is accepted, city or radio taxis (the 1RT series) would be exempt from paying toll tax,” said an official.
 
 However, the facility will not be available to All India Tourist Permits taxis.
