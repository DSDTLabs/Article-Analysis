LUDHIANA: As rain lashed the city on Saturday, it did bring the day temperature down, even as night temperatures remained on the high side. The good and bad news for residents on the weather front is that the Met department forecasts a rise in day temperature in the next few days, but the night temperature might drop.
 
 According to the Met department, 8.2mm rainfall was witnessed in the city since Friday night until 5.30pm on Saturday. The effect of rainfall did reflect on the maximum temperature in the city, which was recorded at 15.8C (three degrees below) normal. However, the minimum temperature was on the higher side at 10.6C (five degrees above normal). The relative humidity on Saturday was also high (95%), which is 15% above normal.
 
 However, even as the day temperature dipped in the city, there was no fog on Saturday, and visibility was less than 3km at 8.30am, and 6km at 11.30am. Meanwhile, the Met department predicts rain to stop in a day's time. "Rain is likely to stop today. Weather is likely to be dry from tomorrow, even as fog might make a re-appearance," said   director Surender Paul. He added that temperatures are likely to dip in the coming days. Even as city residents were grappling with cold-wave conditions in the city, the Met department, on its website, predicted a rise in day temperature (up to 20C), but a fall in night temperature (around 5C) on Tuesday, December 10.
 
 "It was quite cold in the city during the day, and icy winds were blowing. We had to make full use of heating appliances, and sipped ginger tea many times to keep ourselves warm. If things continue like this on the weather front, we might escape to southern India for a holiday," said  , a businessman of BRS Nagar.
