BENGALURU: In a bid to end discriminatory pricing in multiplexes, the government has decided to cap ticket rates at Rs 200. With this, Karnataka will be the second state after Tamil Nadu to impose a ceiling on the ticket price. The government also plans to make it mandatory for multiplexes to screen Kannada and regional language movies between 1.30 pm and 7.30 pm.

 Though the move to cap ticket prices will pinch multiplex owners and impact the inflow of entertainment tax to the government, it is a victory for moviegoers and the Kannada film industry. A senior bureaucrat said the government decided to rein in multiplexes following pressure from the Kannada film industry and in the backdrop of rising public anger against exorbitant ticket prices.
 
 According to sources in the film industry, multiplexes charge Rs 350 to Rs 600 per ticket for Bollywood movies with big stars. The beneficiary is the exhibitor and not the movie producer or distributor, sources said.
 
 But the bigger question is: Will the government convert the assurance into action, given that the multiplex lobby is quite powerful. Bengaluru alone is said to have around 24,000 multiplex seats in around 130 screens.
