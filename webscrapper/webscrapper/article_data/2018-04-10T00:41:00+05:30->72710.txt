Tirupur: The city corporation will establish a command and control centre at the corporation building here to enhance internal security and also to improve traffic management under the smart city mission. “The state government has appointed a committee to decide on how the smart city mission should be utilised for cities other than Chennai. The committee would appoint the consultants of the projects to be undertaken, and detailed project reports (DPRs) would also be prepared by those consultants,” a senior corporation official said. Under the information technology and digitalisation programme of the smart city mission, internal security measures will be undertaken. With similar DPRs likely to be planned for all cities, Tirupur corporation may get more than 200 closed-circuit television cameras. “Feed from those cameras would be displayed on monitors at the command and control centre. They have allotted 3,000sqft for stetting up the centre. Also, live feed from CCTV cameras installed by residential associations and organisations will also be accessed. The police department could utilise them for betterment of internal security,” the official said. The centre will also be used for improving traffic management. The major objective would be to reduce crime rates and road accidents using modern equipment. The civic body would spend Rs 150 crore for establishing the centre. Authorities had fixed April 4 as the last date for completion of tender process. It has been postponed to April 20, the official said. With the same IT and digitalisation programme, the civic body has also planned to implement a common e-payment system, which will enable the residents to pay all the taxes online as well as other services.  The fund will also be allocated to implement smart classrooms in corporation schools, the official added.
