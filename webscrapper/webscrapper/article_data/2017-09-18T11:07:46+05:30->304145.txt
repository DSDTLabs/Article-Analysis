  entered into the   house in the previous episode, and the housemates all believe he’s there to grill them. Instead, he cooks fresh mutton pulao and tomato pacchadi for them. He asks the housemates to relax and only help him with the cooking when he asks for it. While cooking, he keeps talking to the housemates and pulling their leg and Hariteja asks him to his face why he has been targeting her since the last few weeks. He even instructs the viewers on how to make the dishes. 
 
 After the recording of that is shown, Jr NTR says that Diksha is eliminated and Archana, Adarsh, Sivabalaji, Navdeep and Hariteja remain in the Bigg Boss house for the final week. During the ‘Veedi Veedi Gummidi Pandu’ game, Diksha calls Hariteja foolish and manipulative, and calls Archana selfish and disgusting. She tags rest of the housemates with harsh tags too, except for Adarsh whom she calls perfect and sensitive. 
 
 Later Jr NTR nominates Archana as the new captain of the house and a Bigg Bomb is announced for all the housemates, they have to recite the 4 table whenever a buzzer is sounded.
