 At around 6pm on Saturday, the 31-year-old constable reached the mess where the women constables were having evening snacks and sat beside one of them and allegedly misbehaved with her. In their complaint, the women officers told their seniors that the accused was drunk during the incident and also touched two other women constables inappropriately.
 
 They asked him to apologise but he apparently started hurling abuses at them. However when the women threatened to take up the matter with senior officers, he apologised and left. However, he later went up to his room in the gents mess where he went up to the terrace and stripped himself. A few women constables saw him and raised an alarm.
