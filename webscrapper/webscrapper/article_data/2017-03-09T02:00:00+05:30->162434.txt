PATNA: State power regulator on Wednesday indicated that people may have to pay more as there are possibilities of increasing power tariff from the next fiscal (2017-18). 

 It is to be noted that the North Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (NBPDCL) and South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (SBPDCL) had demanded power tariff hike from Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) in 2014-15. Being aggrieved by the BERC order not allowing any hike, the two power distribution companies appealed to the appellate tribunal for electricity (APTEL), which asked the BERC in November last year to reconsider their demand on various points, said a source in the BERC. 
 
 While interacting with the newsmen on Wednesday, BERC chairman SK Negi said the commission has allowed additional revenue requirement (ARR) of Rs33.25 crore to the NBPDCL and Rs25.54 crore to the SBPDCL in the revised order for financial year 2014-15 and the same would be passed and considered when it takes up the ARR for fiscal year 2015-16 with applicable carrying cost.
