NAGPUR: A 2-year-old girl’s head was crushed to pieces after she came under the left front wheel of a mini truck in front of her house at Yashodhara Nagar on Friday at 12.30pm.

Deceased  , younger one of two sisters, was taken to  , where doctors declared her brought dead. 
 
 Cops have registered offence of negligence in driving against Israar and arrested him, following a complaint by deceased’s father Ashraf, a driver.
 
 Cops said Alisaba, while playing inside the house, suddenly came on to the road. Two labourers had unloaded construction material at a site near Alisaba’s home, and got into the van. Just as Sheikh drove the van forward a few meters, Alisaba came under the front wheel. However, the PI said that the exact sequence of events would become clear during investigation.
 
 The deceased’s mother   was busy in household chores when she heard commotion on the road, said the PI.
