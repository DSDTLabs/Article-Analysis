LUCKNOW: Passport applicants from remote   need not come to   passport office to submit their applications as they would be accepted at their respective head   too. Ministry of external affairs on Friday identified 12 head post offices to also function as passport   ( ) in UP. Six of the post offices—in Allahabad, Ayodhya, Ghazipur, Jhansi, Sultanpur and Deoria—will function as Post Office PSKs (POPSKs) under their regional passport office at Lucknow. People from nearby districts may submit their passport applications at the post offices identified and need not come to Lucknow. “We will start the facility soon,” said passport officer, Lucknow, Amit Singh. 

 Besides, head post offices in Agra, GB Nagar, Mathura, Pilibhit, Meerut and Bijnor will also work as POPSK. Ministry of external affairs (MEA) and the department of post (DoP) have decided to utilise the head post office (HPO) in various states as Post Office   (POPSK) for delivering passport related sevices to the people. The objective is to extend passport related services on a larger scale and to ensure wider area coverage.
 
 After the success of pilot POPSK at Mysore in Karnataka and Dahod in Gujarat, MEA and DoP announced in February to open 64 additional POPSKs in other states.
