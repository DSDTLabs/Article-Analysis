NEW DELHI:  , who had stabbed his   and attacked neighbours   in east Delhi on Sunday, has told police that he was married about 10 years ago — for the first time — but his wife had sought divorce from him after he started misbehaving with her. 

 Officers have traced and questioned his present “wife”, who, however, claimed that she was in a live-in relationship with Matta. 
 
 Police said that Matta’s first wife divorced him after a year of marriage. Matta, who was an extremely possessive and suspicious husband, allegedly used to manhandle his wife whenever she stepped out of their house.
 
 Following the divorce, Matta allegedly assaulted several women and was even jailed for the same two years ago, officers said.
 
 Matta told police that he got married for the second time last July and told his parents about it in September, but they refused to accept his wife. Matta’s present “wife” said that he felt extremely humiliated after being ousted from his house and often talked about how he was ignored and insulted.
 
 Nandan, the guard who was first targeted by Matta, said that he brought the woman to the house two months ago, but was humiliated by his father Ravinder Matta. Nandan said that Matta did not come back home for a week after the incident. 
 
 “If I had intervened further when he was trying to kill his father, he would have killed me too. He had come with the motive to kill all those who supported his parents,” said Nandan.
 
 Meanwhile, police said that Ravinder’s postmortem will be conducted on Wednesday, after his younger son, Mukul, returns. Relatives said that Matta was always jealous of his younger brother as he was favoured by their parents. At present Matta is admitted in   hospital amid tight security.
 
 “He is stable and will be discharged in a day or two,” said a senior police officer.
