TRICHY: After an FIR was lodged by some depositors in the Rs 25 crore chit-fund cheating case, the economic offences wing has appealed to other depositors, who were affected by a fraudulent couple, to lodge complaints against them, so that they can file the charge sheet soon.

 According to a complaint lodged by M   of Vellalar Street, Manjamalli, Thanjavur with the crime branch, a couple RK Radhakrishnan-R   alias  , of   in Kumbakonam in Thanjavur had been running a finance company called Chithra Chit Fund Tamil Nadu Private Limited at   in Aaduthurai in the district. They had offered a bounty return at the rate of 24 per cent, if they deposited money with their chit fund company.
 
 Believing their words, he had deposited to the tune of Rs 1.04 crore in his name and Rs 5.25 lakh in his wife C Shanthi's name. According to Chezhian, more than 500 people had deposited their money to the tune of Rs 25 crore in their chit-fund company.
 
 As their deposit scheme had matured in April 2017, he approached the company to withdraw his deposit with the interest. To his shock, the office was found locked. As his repeated attempts to contact the couple went in vain, he lodged a complaint, Chezhian had stated.
 
 Based on his complaint, sleuths from Trichy economic offences wing police registered a case under section 406, 420 IPC and 5 of TNPID (F and E) Act 1997.
 
 Meanwhile, authorities from the economic offences wing also appealed to the people who had deposited money with the chit-fund company, to come forward to lodge their complaints separately, so that they could proceed with the case further.
