PATNA:   ( ) celebrated its 47th foundation day on Sunday. On this occasion, 26   medals were awarded to eight postgraduate and 18 undergraduate students of the college. Almost 90% of the 26 students were girls. Swati, an undergraduate student of obstetrics and gyneacology, got three gold medals.
 
  NMC alumni from all over the world attended the celebrations and took part in the cultural programme organized to commemorate the day, said college principal Shiv Kumari Prasad.
  
  College sources said the celebrations had started almost last week. A few days back, students had organized a fashion show on the campus and released the college magazine, Povryam.
  
  NMC Alumni Association chairman Bimal Karak said a few issues needed the administration’s immediate attention. “The postgraduation course in NMC now boasts of 150 seats, but we need to improve the facilities provided to the students. At least four lecture theatres and an auditorium should be developed. The hospital needs to immediately install CT scan, a good lab and MRI machines. The hospital is also in dire need of more doctors. The administration also needs to take a positive step towards the coordination of hostel security with the government,” he said.
  
  Chief guest Padma Shri Dr SN Arya congratulated the hospital on completing 47 years of its existence. Vice-chancellor of   Dr Samarendra Pratap Singh was the guest of honour.
  
  College sources said chief minister   and state education minister Ashok Choudhary were also invited for the function but could not make it due to their busy schedule.
