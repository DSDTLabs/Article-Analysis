LUCKNOW:   in the city observed a day-long strike on Friday to   against the killing of two traders in Mathura earlier this week.

 The jewellers staged a dharna at the GPO crossing demanding justice for the aggrieved family of slain jewellers. Office bearers of Lucknow jewellers association submitted a memorandum to state minister Shrikant Sharma, demanding adequate security for jewellers in the state.
 
 Experts estimate that the bandh resulted in loss of gold sale worth about Rs 15 crore.
 
 Adeesh Jain, organisational secretary of Lucknow jewellers’ association, said, “We demanded increased vigilance around jewellers shops and deployment of more police in market areas but we were told that there is shortage of police staff. They government there is only one police available per 400 people in city. So now we are asking for installation of more CCTV cameras in markets.”
 
 The minister agreed to installation of more CCTV cameras. “We have suggested that many shopkeepers keep CCTV cameras inside their shops. Each one of us can take one camera out and install it on road to keep vigil on commuters. The police can at least ensure that shopkeepers cooperate and install one of their cameras outside for better security,” added Jain.
 
 The minister has agreed to the proposal and has assured to soon send out an advisory on same to all jewellers. 
 
 On May 15, two traders were killed and two others injured during a robbery at jewellery shops in Mathura.
