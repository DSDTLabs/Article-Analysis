BENGALURU: A 50-year-old woman was mowed down at Eighth Mile near Peenya on the   by an unidentified vehicle that sped off on Saturday. While that smacked of callousness, the woman lay for about 15 minutes on the road and was run over by several other vehicles before police arrived on the scene. The family of the victim could only identify the mashed remains from the woman’s clothes. 

 A Jayamma, the victim, had alighted from a private bus at Eighth Mile at about 10.30pm. She then called her son, A Chandrashekar, an auto driver by profession, who told her to wait at the bus stop on the other side of the road and that he would pick her up. Chandrashekar immediately set out from Chikkabidarakallu, about 4km away where the family resides, to the bus stop.
 
 Jayamma was crossing the road to the bus stop when she was knocked down. It is unclear if the impact killed her immediately, but since it was dark and the density of traffic high, several other vehicles went over. By then police were alerted by passers-by.
 
 “Before we could shift the body, many vehicles ran over her, mangling it badly,” police said.
 
 Meanwhile, Chandrashekar, unaware of the accident, had reached the spot and hunted in vain for his mother. On making enquires, he was told by passers-by that a woman had been involved in an accident and that the police had shifted the body to the Nelamangala government hospital. Chandrashekar immediately left for the hospital.
 
 “At mortuary, Chandrashekar had great difficulty in identifying the body since it was badly mashed up,” police said. “He was only able to identify it from the sari and the   she was wearing.”
