NEW DELHI: The Centre told the   on Friday that no more windows would be available for people who failed to deposit cash in scrapped Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes by the December 31 deadline.

 On March 21, the   had asked the Centre to explain whether it contemplated giving citizens another window to deposit   if they proved their difficulty in not meeting the December 31 deadline, given the fact that PM   had so promised in his November 8 speech.
 
 In an affidavit filed in the SC through  , the Centre said, “The central government took a conscious decision that no necessity or any justifiable reason exists either in law or on facts to invoke its power under Section 4(1) (ii) of the ordinance to entitle any person to tender within the grace period the specified bank notes.”
 
 This means the nearly dozen petitioners, who together had sought a window to deposit Rs 66.80 lakh held by them in scrapped currency, will lose it as the money has turned into scrap paper. 
 
 The Centre said the petitioners could not deposit the money as their bank accounts were not KYC compliant.
 
 The Centre said ‘Operation Clean Money’ initiated by the income tax department to verify cash deposits made between November 9 and December 30 has led to “identification of approximately 18 lakh persons for online scrutiny as they appeared to be not in line with tax payers’ profile.”
