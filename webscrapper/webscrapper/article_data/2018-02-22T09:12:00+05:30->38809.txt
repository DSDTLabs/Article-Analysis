BENGALURU: The state government’s plan to provide reservation for Kannadigas in Group C and D jobs in the private sector seems to have hit a roadblock as the state’s advocategeneral said the proposal is not in line with the spirit of the Constitution.

 The state government, in its 2017-18 budget, promised to provide reservation in Group C and D jobs in the private sector. In reply to a question by BJP’s Ganesh   in the council, law and parliamentary affairs minister T B   said meetings held between department officials and the advocate-general in September 2017 and January 2018, said the proposal violates Article 16 of the Constitution and the issue of providing reservation falls under the purview of the central government. The meeting suggested that the government may try and implement the proposal using the word ‘priority’ instead of reservation, he added.
 
 “We have already taken legal opinion and will try to bring an amendment to the Karnataka Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1961, after considering the constitutional provisions,’’ Jayachandra said.
 
 Karnik said unless the central government intervenes by bringing in a national policy to provide reservation for local candidates, implementing the state’s proposal is highly unlikely.
