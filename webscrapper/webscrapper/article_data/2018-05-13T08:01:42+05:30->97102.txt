HYDERABAD: An SBI ATM machine dispensed torn and smudged Rs 2,000 currency notes on Friday night much to the shock of a businessman, who promptly filed a complaint with   police on Saturday.

 
 Though no case has been registered yet, a police official said: “We will forward the complaint to the State Bank of India’s branch concerned to resolve the matter on Monday.”
 
  withdrew Rs 10,000 from the ATM of Vanasthalipuram branch. “I was really shocked at the condition of the currency. Of the five Rs 2,000 notes, two notes were torn with one stickers tagged to it, two others were smeared with ink and some liquid and the other one had some letters and numbers missing on one side of the note,” he said.
 
 “As none of the notes is useful, I tried to deposit the cash in the deposit machine but in vain,” said Aditya. He also tried to exchange the currency notes at shops, but none of the vendors was ready to accept them.   then tweeted the matter on the official SBI account, explaining his plight and filed a written complaint at Vanasthalipuram police station.
 
 “Currency notes entered into ATMs are checked for quality and authenticity. Hence, the chances of a mutilated note being disbursed from our ATM are negligible. Please note, you may exchange a mutilated note at any of our branches,"   @TheOfficialSBI replied to Aditya’s tweet.
