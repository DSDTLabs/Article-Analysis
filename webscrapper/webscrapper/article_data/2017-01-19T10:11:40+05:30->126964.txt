IMPHAL: Personnel of the village defence force ( ) in  , who have the same responsibilities as police, have threatened to stay away from election duty from February 21 if the   government failed to increase their monthly honorarium from Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000. 

 The VDF has a sanctioned strength of 10,050 and functions under  .
 
 "The state government has continued to ignore our demands for more benefits so we have taken the decision of staying away from all kinds of duties from February 21," Laishram Deban, president of All Manipur VDF Welfare Association, told TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 "We work as much as the police but we get a measly honorarium of Rs 5,000 per month," Deban said. He added that the men also had to buy their uniforms, including jackets and boots, with this money. Most VDF men had been given the task of guarding goods trucks in isolated locations along the Imphal-Dimapur and Imphal-Silchar highways during the ongoing economic blockade and the paltry wages were making their life difficult, he explained.
 
 The state government recruited men for the VDF in two phases - March 2009 and February 2011. The VDF personnel were initially recruited to defend villages from militants. They would earlier receive an honorarium of Rs 3,000 plus an allowance of Rs 570 but this was increased after repeated protests.
