Ranchi: Mobile food vans across the city might face the wrath of the Ranchi Municipal Corporation ( ) soon. Hundreds of food vans are parked across the city every evening serving a variety of cuisines ranging from Chinese to South Indian.

 However, very few of them are registered with the RMC. Till date, only 22   owners have applied for licences, of which, applications for 15 have been approved and five of them have paid the   fees.
 
 Some of the major places where food vans are found in the city includes Morhabadi, Kutchery, Ratu Road, Lalpur and Kanke Road. 
 
 Municipal commissioner Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said, “It is important to have a license to park food vans on the road but it has come to our notice that most of the owners do not comply to the same. A drive against such vans will begin after the municipal elections are over. Also, new licences would be issued to these vans.”
 
 For vans on main roads, the licence fee is Rs 5,000. This apart, the owners will also have to pay Rs 5,000 per month along with GST to the RMC. The food vans that are parked in the interior roads will have to pay a fees of Rs 2,500 per month.
 
 Once the drive starts, a fine of Rs 1,000 will be imposed on the owners of food vans who do not have a proper license and will be directed to get a license from the RMC. In case the owners do not pay the fine, the food vans will be seized.
 
 “After the licence is issued, the owner will be able to park their vans only on a particular place. Also, they will have to put up a copy of the licence in front of their van. In case they park the van elsewhere, they would be fined,” Agrahari said.
