 earned critical acclaim with his gritty performance in ‘Badlapur’. Now, according to reports, producer   is planning a sequel to the Sriram Raghavan-directed film and his favourite actress   is being considered for the role of the protagonist. 

  
  
 While ‘Badlapur’ was driven by Varun Dhawan’s character who avenges his wife and kid’s deaths, the sequel will reportedly be with a female protagonist and an all-new cast. It will be a character-driven story, much like its prequel. Reports suggest that Dinesh Vijan pitched the idea to Deepika, who immediately took a liking to it. However, the script is still in the works and once it’s completed, the actress will apparently be given a narration. The makers are hoping to get ‘Badlapur 2’ rolling in the second half of 2018.
 
  Over the years, Dinesh has worked with Deepika in films like ‘Cocktail’, ‘Love Aaj Kal’, ‘Finding Fanny’ and even his directorial debut, ‘Raabta’, where the actress can be seen in the title track.
