The beats of dhol tasha during   add to the festive spirit in the city. But this year, the sounds will be a bit muted. Reason:   to reduce noise pollution has deterred quite a few participants.

  Every year, most dhol tasha groups start practicing two months prior to Ganpati. But this year, in a meeting with the dhol tasha groups,   Commissioner Rashmi Shukla announced that they can practice from July 25 (giving them only a month to practice), in accordance with the Indian Environment Act and directives of the Supreme Court.
 
  Most of the dhol pathaks in the city are upset over the noise pollution norms. They feel late permissions for practice have also affected the enrolment this year.
 
  Vijay Salunke of the   said, “The police intervention due to environment norms has discouraged some youngsters who were keen to join the pathaks. There is a dip in enrolment by 40 per cent. Every year we get approximately 400 admissions, but this year there are hardly 175 people who have registered.”
 
  
  Tushar Mankar of Rudra Garjana Pathak echoed similar sentiments. “It is going to be tough this year. Since the permission to practice has been delayed, most youngsters do not have the time to take it up. They are busy with their college admissions. The number of people joining us has gone down.”
 
  Unlike last year, Ganesh festival is early this year (last year it was in Sept 5-Sept 15) and most of the youngsters are busy with the ongoing college admission process.
 
  Some pathaks like the Shivgarjana have reduced the number of performances this year, owing to the drop in the number of members. “As the registrations are less this year, the groups will attend fewer mandals,” Salunke.
