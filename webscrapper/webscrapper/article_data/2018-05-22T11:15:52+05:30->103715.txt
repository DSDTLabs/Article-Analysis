NOIDA: A 30-year-old man was arrested for allegedly cheating people by selling them newly purchased two-wheelers financed from banks using   documents and identity proofs. The accused, Aiyaaz, was arrested from near Kakrala police chowki at 12.40 am on Monday.

 
 Aiyaaz and main accused Kuldeep, who is allegedly a lawyer, would take take loans from the banks for vehicles promising to pay EMIs every month. “The bank would sanction the loans but when EMIs have to be paid every month, the bank officials would seek the same from the residents whose documents were attached with the loan application form. As the duo would use fake addresses, the bank officials would then have to search for those people staying at the mentioned addresses,” said Swetabh Pandey, circle officer-III.
 
 SHO, Phase II, Satendra Rai said the duo would use tampered Aadhaar cards as documentary proof to get loans.
 
 Aiyaaz told police that Kuldeep used to prepare the fake documents as he knows at least two persons – Gaurav and Dinesh — who can help in the same, adding that they financed loans from Capital bank and HDFC bank in Ghaziabad.
 
 “They would feign about urgent medical need in family for selling off new two-wheelers at lower rates. Interested buyers would fall in the trap and happily get the   transferred to their names,” Pandey said.
 
 Police is not disputing the involvement of officials of the transport department and banks concerned but said the same would be clear after Kuldeep gets arrested, who is presently absconding.
 
 Aiyaaz has a case of theft registered in Connaught Place, Delhi. The two have been operating in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar since a year.
