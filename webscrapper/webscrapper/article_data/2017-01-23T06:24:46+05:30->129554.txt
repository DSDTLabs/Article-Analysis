ABU DHABI: India and the UAE will sign an agreement sealing a “comprehensive strategic partnership” between the two countries when Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan visits this week as chief guest of the Republic Day parade. “It will be one of 10 agreements that we will be signing,” said  , state minister for foreign affairs, who has just returned from India after holding the first strategic dialogue with his counterpart  . 

 This dialogue will also serve as an oversight mechanism for the relationship. “We plan to keep the mechanism nimble, and will meet twice a year,” Gargash said. As reported by TOI, a military contingent from the UAE will march in the Republic Day parade, which will be a first of sorts. Sheikh Mohammed is expected to arrive on January 24, hold official talks the next day and attend the parade on January 26. He will be coming with a large delegation including minister of economy Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansouri, who will also visit   to scout for economic opportunities. 
 
 “We now have strategic direction. Prime Minister   did something remarkable by investing in this relationship,” Gargash said. “Private sector ties were always strong but governments were behind the curve. Now governments are in the driving seat, and that is important,” he added. In February, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, will send four of its executive directors to India to identify investment opportunities, particularly in the infrastructure sector. Gargash said a study by the UAE government had decided several years ago that India should be a focus of their diplomacy. But it needed India to take the lead in pushing the bilateral relationship to a different level.
