BHOPAL: After 90 days of being on the run,   — accused of sexually abusing children at Residential Bridging Centre in Bairagarh, was nabbed by   police on Monday.

 After registering a case two-and-a-half months ago, the cops finally sprung to action and picked up the accused from his place and brought him to AJK police station in Habibganj. Using newspaper clippings and a few excerpts from reports of school education department and Childline, the accused made attempts to get some relief by applying for bail.
 
 “Since the section of   has been registered, we have arrested him. But he immediately applied for bail. If he is sent into custody by court, further investigation of the case will be done,”   Mohan Sarban told TOI.
 
 The incident was reported on December 2, last year. Police had then refused to register an FIR despite the fact that 18 students reached the police station to get their statements recorded. The children alleged that their warden Ajay Sharma has been clicking their nude and obscene pictures on pretext of putting medicine.
