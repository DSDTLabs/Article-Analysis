THANE: The scorching sun is not only taking a   on humans, but also the animals in the city. The increasing temperature which has been above 35 degree Celcius since the past few weeks and have rose till 43 degree Celsius and seems to have affected the animals the most.

 “In the last one week itself, I have got seven calls where   suffered   strokes. The birds which breathe from their mouth were the most affected. The sun’s harsh rays usually affect birds like kites,  , owls as their nets are almost on the top most branch of the tree. Sometimes even pigeons suffer, but not much, as their nests are not very high,” said Dr Rina Dev avian and exotic specialist.
 
 The vets even claimed that as this is the nesting season of kites, they travel a lot for food.
 
 “Birds go in search of food after sunrise. But as this is the nesting season for the kites and their eggs have hatched recently, their babies are barely few weeks old. Each baby bird requires around 100grams of meat and if the bird has hatched more than three eggs then they have to travel for longer span to give food to all the baby kites. Also, kites usually nest in coconut trees, which does not provide shade, which also results them into coming under the direct sunlight and getting dehydrated,” added Dev.
 
 Few animal lovers stated that even the calls of birds getting dehydrated has increased.
 
 The animal rescuers are using various social media platforms to inform residents and people to keep a bowl of water for birds and strays as that’s the only way to keep them hydrated in this heat.
 
 “It is advisable to feed a dehyadrated bird some elctrolyte water and wrap the bird in a wet cloth and keep them in a ventilated cardboard box till they reach a vet,” said Nilesh Bhanage, founder of a city-based   (PAWS).
