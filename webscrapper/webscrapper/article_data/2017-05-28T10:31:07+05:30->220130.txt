LUCKNOW: Saturday was one of the most eventful days for   when all its zonal engineers launched the most fierce drive yet against illegal constructions in their areas. While four buildings were bulldozed and over a dozen unauthorised buildings sealed across the city, an LDA supervisor and a police constable received severe injuries in the afternoon during the drive in Hussainganj. 

  Even as the two victims were rushed to hospital for first aid, angry traders staged protest in   area of Gomtinagar against the drive. LDA had sealed two commercial complexes in Gomtinagar two days ago and on Saturday too, it sealed two smaller malls in Viram and Vikaskhand of Gomtinagar. The traders came out on the street, opposing the move. 
 
 In all, LDA sealed 13 buildings across the city, most of them being commercial complexes, for having flouted building bylaws. Buildings were sealed in Gomtinagar, Hussainganj, Chowk and old area, Sitapur Road and Aliganj while four buildings were bulldozed too — three in Sarojininagar and a multistorey complex in Hussainganj. 
 
 The drive began at 9am and went on till 5pm. Locals said it was only after the high court cracked the whip that LDA swung into action and sealed the highest number of buildings in a day.
 
 An LDA official said, “We have rushed our injured supervisor to KGMU’s Trauma Centre and he’s stable now. The constable received fewer injuries and he was sent to the Civil Hospital.”
 
 The two were standing beside a bulldozer in Hussainganj when it started on its own and its (wing) clutch started moving. It hit the supervisor and the constable standing nearby and the two received facial injuries.
