PATNA: The Patna high court on Monday directed the health department to ensure that CT scan and MRI machines are installed in all government medical colleges and hospitals in the state by the end of February.
 
  Hearing a PIL filed by  , an NGO, the division bench of Acting Chief Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice Sudhir Singh observed that the health department should honour its commitment and get the machines installed by February- end.
  
  The PIL was originally filed in 2015, demanding an inquiry by a specialised agency against the then superintendent of   and Hospital (NMCH) for discrepancies in purchase of CT scan machine. The petitioners had alleged purchase of inferior quality machine by the then NMCH superintendent in connivance with other officials in health department.
  
  The petitioners had alleged that CT scan machine manufactured by a firm in 2008 developed frequent snags, but the NMCH administration was purchasing another machine manufactured by the same firm.
  
  Later, the court directed the health department to give a timeframe for installation of CT scan and MRI machines not only at NMCH, but all government and medical colleges in the state. The principal secretary of the health department gave an assurance to the court that the machines would be installed by March 2015. The health department later asked for two extensions, initially for six months and again by another three months.
  
  During the hearing on Monday, the HC recapitulated its earlier order and asked the health department regarding actions taken till date. The health department filed a counter-affidavit stating that the CT scan and MRI machines would be installed at NMCH by February 15 and at other government medical college and hospitals by the end of February.
  
  Adjourning the case for next hearing on February 27, the court observed that the health department should ensure that the machines are installed within the committed time-frame.
