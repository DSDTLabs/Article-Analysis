GURUGRAM: One of the buses of Delhi Public School (DPS), Sushant Lok, was impounded on Friday after it rammed into a   at a traffic   near Wazirabad on Friday morning as the driver allegedly skipped the signal and took an abrupt right turn.

 Sources said schoolchildren were onboard the   when the incident took place.
 
 Divya Seshan, an HR professional whose car was hit, told the police that she was returning home after dropping her children at school. When she stopped at the traffic signal near Wazirabad around 8.30am, a bus belonging to DPS Sushant Lok was next to her on the right and around 10 seconds before the signal turned green, the driver allegedly took an abrupt right. The tail of the bus ended up hitting her car on the right. The driver did not even indicate that he was turning right, Seshan said.
 
 Seshan chased the bus and confronted the driver. When she sought his driving licence, the driver could not show it to her. She then tried to contact the school authorities using the two phone numbers written on the bus, but could not get through any of them. She then dialled the police control room and the local police reached the spot. By then, a person from the school administration also reached the spot and showed the driverâ€™s licence on his phone. The photo of the licence, which was a photocopy, was not even legible, Seshan alleged.
 
 Seshan then filed a   at the Sushant Lok police station following which, an FIR was registered under sections 279, 336 and 427 of the IPC. ASI Devender Singh said that the police have impounded the bus.
