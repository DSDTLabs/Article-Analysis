BENGALURU: Disgruntled   aspirant from CV Raman Nagar   on Saturday said he and his supporters were set to resign from the party and join JD(S).

 
 Ramesh is in a tug-of-war with PWD minister  , who is seeking to contest from CV Raman Nagar. "Having learned that I will not be getting a ticket to contest from CV Raman Nagar, a constituency which I have nurtured, my supporters and I have decided to quit Congress and join JD(S)," he said.
 
 Having lost the 2013 elections to BJP's sitting MLA S Raghu by a margin of 8,419 votes, Ramesh said the party has not recognised his value and the efforts he has put into the constituency.
 
 "I have spent my own money on some occasions to nurture the party in the constituency and hold programmes to popularise government schemes," he said.
 
 Calling himself a "close friend" of CM Siddaramaiah, after the latter left JD(S) and joined Congress, Ramesh said he felt betrayed. "Despite my close defeat at the 2013 elections,   asked me to vacate the seat for his friend Mahadevappa. Even when there were atrocities conducted against me by the police, he did not step in to save me," he said.
