MUMBAI: A closer look at the actual money spent by   on various   in 2016-17 reveals the same old story—a huge difference between the  , the   and the   resulting in a big chunk of unutilized funds.

 For instance, Rs 237.4 crore was allocated in the 2016-17   for the solid waste management department project works. The estimate was later revised to Rs 122 crore, but finally only Rs 69.7 crore was spent—43%. Similar was the case with bridges and stormwater departments’ project works (see box). In the case of BMC’s two big-ticket projects —Mumbai Coastal Road and Goregoan Mulund Link Road —of the Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 130 crore allocations, only Rs 4.8 crore and Rs 1.6 crore respectively have been spent till March 30.
 
 Prior to the budget 2017-18, Shiv Sena and BJP—the ruling combine in BMC—had demanded that allocations be made realistically for project works.
 
 A civic official said the   chief had realized that allocated funds were lying unutilized and hence, asked department heads to clearly identify the works for which allocations are needed and seek funds accordingly. “This is one of the core causes that led to the downsized budget. In many cases, the revised estimates are much less than the initial estimates,” said the official. For the first time in BMC’s recent history, a downsized budget—from Rs 37,052 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 25,141 crore, a 32% cut—was presented before the standing committee on Wednesday. 
 
 On Friday, former MNS cororporator Sandeep Deshpande said BMC downsizing the 2017-18 budget because it could not spending the allocated funds is an administrative lacuna.
