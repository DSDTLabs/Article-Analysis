Vadodara: Thalassemia patients in the city will be able to get free access to chelation pumps as city-based NGO The Wishing Factory (TWF) will soon start a pump library in the city.

 The library, which will be first of its kind in Gujarat, will be similar to a lending book library. Patients will be able to borrow chelation pump device for free and can keep them for four to eight days in a month. “Not everyone can afford a chelation pump, and going through chelation process in a hospital is also a lengthy process, therefore we decided to come up with something like this,” said Partth Thakur, founder of TWF. He added that the pumps are designed in Italy and it costs anywhere between Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000.
 
 Since chelation process can also be done at home, the patients can borrow the pump free of cost from the library and share it with other thalassemia patients. “In the beginning we are planning to have 15 pumps in the library which will be funded by Inox Wind. In the first year of our operations, we are aiming that at least 70 patients benefit from the library,” Thakur told TOI.
 
 Thakur said that they were planning to set up the library in the centre of the city so that patients visiting from outside can also benefit from it easily. The NGO has similar libraries in Mumbai and Pune which were funded by Indian Railways and a pharmaceutical company.
 
 “Besides the set-up of library, even the designing was done for free by the architects Mandar Gandevikar and Ahana Shah,” Thakur said.
