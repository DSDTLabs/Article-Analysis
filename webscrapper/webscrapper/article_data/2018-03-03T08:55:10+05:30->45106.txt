THRISSUR: Private hospital nurses affiliated to United Nurses' Association ( ) will go on mass leave for an indefinite period from Tuesday, as part of their ongoing agitation. 

 The nurses are demanding hike in wages and government intervention to end the strike at the   in Cherthala, and they were planning to launch indefinite strike, across the state from Monday.
 
 The decision to go on mass leave indefinitely has been taken in the backdrop of the temporary ban on strike imposed by the Kerala high court, while considering a petition filed by hospital managements.
 
 The UNA president Jasmin Shah said the stay order on strike by high court was erroneous as the nurses were not receiving even the wages as directed by the Supreme Court.
 
 Shah said the state government should urgently intervene to get the stay against the strike vacated. However, the attitude of the state government appears to be in favour of the hospital managements. The government had not even convened a conciliation meeting so far to settle the 192-day old strike at KVM Hospital.
 
 The government had earlier announced that the minimum basic wages of the private hospital staff will be Rs 20,000, after the conciliation talks convened by chief minister   in July. The government had also announced then that procedures for implementing the pay hike would be completed in six months. However, the wage revision process is in a limbo after the draft notification had been promulgated, said  , the patron of the UNA.
 
 UNA leaders said the association would implead in the case when the high court considers it again on Monday. 
 
 Jasmin Shah said nearly 62,000 nurses in 457 private hospitals in the state would join the mass leave agitation from Tuesday.
