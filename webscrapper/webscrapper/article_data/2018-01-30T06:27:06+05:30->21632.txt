MUMBAI: Mumbaikars are in for a unique celestial show on January 31 as a rare combination of a total lunar eclipse, full Moon and Supermoon, making it a Blue Moon and Red Moon, occurs simultaneously.

 The three lunar events will take place between 6 pm and around 9 pm.
 
 Nehru Planetarium director,  , said his institution is installing telescopes, and a live webcast has also been planned. “The webcast will allow people to watch the eclipse on their mobiles,” he said.
 
 “People can also watch the eclipse through the naked eye as well as binoculars,’’ he added.
 
  on Dr E Moses Road, Worli, is installing two telescopes on the building terrace.
 
 Space Geeks Mumbai, a new space-and-astronomy focussed organisation, has joined hands with a private body called Awestritch and chosen an unconventional venue for viewing the eclipse--a cafeteria opposite Radio Club in   where telescopes will be placed.
 
 Pointing out why Wednesday’s total lunar eclipse is significant, Space Geeks co-founder Chintamani Pai said, “This is going to be a rare opportunity for astronomy enthusiasts as the next two total lunar eclipses in Mumbai---July 27, 2018 and September 7, 2025--will be during the monsoon and, in all probability, could be blocked by overcast skies.’’ According to him, the next visible total lunar eclipse in Mumbai will be on December 31, 2028.
 
 He said on Wednesday, the Moon will rise at 6.33 pm and the maximum eclipse will be at 6.59 pm. “Those keen to see the eclipse should look toward the eastern horizon which is the Gateway of India side.”
 
 A website-http://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/india/Mumbai--has come up with an animation clip showing approximately what the eclipse will look like from the night side of the Earth.
 
 This website also has a Mumbai eclipse countdown which enables viewers to see how many days, hours, minutes and seconds are left.
