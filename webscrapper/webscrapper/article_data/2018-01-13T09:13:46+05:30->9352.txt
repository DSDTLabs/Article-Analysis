LUCKNOW: The 13-day-old child of the 12-year-old   from Indira Nagar’s Suggamau area was on Friday surrendered by the survivor for adoption. The survivor is currently at the women’s shelter home while the newborn is under the care of children’s shelter home, both of these being at   road.

 Even though the survivor had been sent to the shelter home on December 31, the family had failed to turn up since for the surrender process to begin. “The girl’s mother came to us on Friday with her elder son and gave it in writing that they did not want to keep the newborn boy child. She also wanted the survivor to be kept at the shelter home for a few more days for her health to improve,” said child welfare committee member Sangeeta Sharma.
