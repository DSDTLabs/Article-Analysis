PATNA: A 24-year-old girl has alleged that BJP MLC Awadhesh Narayan Singh’s sons   Ranjan and   held her captive at their father’s government bungalow with an intention to sexually assault her on May 16.

 The girl, said to be a flight attendant working with a private airlines, submitted a written complaint in this regard at the Women’s police station in Patna on Friday evening. An FIR was lodged on Saturday.
 
 “According to the complaint, the girl knew Sushant who invited her to his house. She was allegedly locked inside a room and thrashed and abused by Sushant and Prashant. The complaint also says the duo attempted to kill her,” a police officer said and added she would be taken to the MLC’s bungalow for identification of the place of occurrence.
 
 City SP (central) D Amarkesh said the girl also alleged the two accused wanted to sexually assault her before she somehow managed to run away. He said an FIR could not be lodged on Friday as the victim had done overwriting in parts of her complaint. “We had called her again on Saturday with a fresh complaint,” he said.
 
 MLC Singh, when contacted, told TOI he was not in Patna on the day of the alleged incident and had returned from Delhi on Saturday morning. “I am shocked to know about the complaint from media reports. As of now, I can only say the girl had studied with my son in a local school. Nothing like what is being alleged by her actually happened,” he said and added he would get further details from his sons.
