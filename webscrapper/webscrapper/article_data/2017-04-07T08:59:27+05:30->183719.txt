PUNE: The National Film Archive of India ( ) has received significant non-cinematic contribution like film posters from filmmaker   to be added to the rich collection of the institute. 

 The sizable donation includes ancillary material of Chopra's films Parinda (1989), 1942: A Love Story (1994),   (1998), Mission Kashmir (2000), Parineeta (2005) and Eklavya: The Royal Guard (2007).
 
 The collection is a mix of lobby cards, film posters, song booklets, contact sheets, promotional catalogues and working stills of the films. Working stills are photographs that were taken behind the scenes during the shooting a film. 
 
 But the most significant part of this collection is perhaps the handwritten notes and audio-video continuity sheets penned for 'Eklavya: The Royal Guard'. An embossed, leather-bound book containing the synopsis and promotional material is also a part of the collection.
 
 Apart from these six film titles, the filmmaker has also presented a retrospective book and a DVD set containing all his films, starting from Khamosh (1985) till Parinda (1989).
 
 Prakash Magdum, NFAI director, said, "It is particularly satisfying that such a valuable collection is coming to the NFAI on the 84th birth anniversary of P K Nair, the first director of the NFAI."
 
 Magdum has appealed to people possessing items worthy of preserving, whether it's a leaflet/newspaper/ photographs/prints/movie stills, to send it to the NFAI for preservation.
