HYDERABAD:In clear violation of ‘green’ norms, scores of two and four-wheelers are seen making their way into the city’s   every day, thus endangering the lives of animals inside. With   officials failing to control their movement, this trend is fast snowballing into a serious crisis.

 
 
  
 
 
 In 2014, the Zoos and Parks Authority of Telangana ( ) had banned the entry of petrol/diesel vehicles inside the zoo park and had even declared the area as a ‘silent zone’ in order to curb the rising levels of air and noise pollution within the premises. The fleet of battery-operated vehicles was also increased to replace these cars/bikes.
 
 Clearly, the rule has now been forgotten.
 
 The illegal practice has left both the habitat and the wildlife adversely affected, as motor vehicle emissions are the biggest contributors to poor air quality. That it also seriously disturbs the ecology, is another story. To make matters worse, the continuous honking has puts wild animals under tremendous stress.
 
 When confronted, zoo authorities said how despite deploying more staff at the ground level and posting officials to keep a strict vigil on the enclosures, it is very difficult to control people form flouting norms, especially on days when there is heavy footfall.
 
 “I agree that people are taking their vehicles inside the premises despite the ban. I have seen people on two-wheelers inside,” said Shivani Dogra, curator, Nehru Zoological Park , however, quickly adding: “This has started recently when I was on a leave. We will definitely take measures to curb this problem.”
