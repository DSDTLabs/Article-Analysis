NAVI MUMBAI: Despite Bombay High Court directives disallowing parking of vehicles under flyovers for security reason, the Mahape-Shil flyover is housed to rampant   of private vehicles. The area has turned into an illegal free parking zone in the absence of security measures being taken by agencies. Authorities are turning a blind eye to this menace, allege locals. 

 Private vehicle operators are finding the spot a safe haven for free parking. And the entire 1.2 km stretch has been eaten up by illegal parking. “In this case   comes well under the court directive where parking is not permitted for security of such key infrastructure,” said  , an activist. 
 
 The high court in 2013 had instructed the government not to award new contracts to private players after expiry of the existing agreement for pay and park below old flyovers. In fact, the court had directed the government to prohibit such parking under new flyovers. After facing flak the traffic wing is contemplating taking action against such encroachers. “We will soon take stock of the situation and hold consultation with other agencies to initiate steps to discourage such practice. Action will be seen on ground soon,” DCP(traffic), Nitin Pawar told TOI.
 
 When asked, a MMRDA official said, “We have time and again offered MIDC to take over the flyover for ownership and maintenance as this was developed in MIDC corridor.”
 
 The Rs 70 crore flyover of 1.2km long has been built by MMRDA to decongest vehicular traffic that connects Navi Mumbai with Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli, Taloja. “We had received the letter from MMRDA to complete the transfer process. But the offer was turned down by us for technical reasons. It’s still with MMRDA,” said Avinash Mali, deputy engineer, MIDC.
