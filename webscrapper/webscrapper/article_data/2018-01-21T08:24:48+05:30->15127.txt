 Halep, 26 - at 5 ft 6 in her   shoes, is four inches taller than her opponent - said she had never played a match like this before. “I just kept playing. I kept believing that it’s not over, even if she’s leading a little bit more. I gave everything I had today, I’m really proud that I could stay there and win it. It was not easy at all,” Halep, who will play Japan’s Naomi Osaka in the fourth round, said.
 
 The Romanian, who has struggled with getting on top of challenges, stepping back and letting it slip, stuck with the task on Saturday, the longer it went, the deeper she dug. Especially in the 2-hour-22-minute third set which had 11 breaks of serve and two medical treatments for the 76th-ranked Davis whose toes on both feet were infected.
 
 “In the past I wouldn’t have fought that hard. Maybe when she had the match balls I would have lost it,” Halep, who fought off three match points in the 22nd game, but closed on the first opportunity she had, said. “I was talking a lot during the match. I was a little bit frustrated because of the leg. I felt the pain all match, but I didn’t give up. The big win is that I could handle it.”
 
 Halep said the match points helped her relax. “I thought it’s over at that moment. It was good because I relax my arm and I serve pretty well those three balls. And then she took the medical.”
