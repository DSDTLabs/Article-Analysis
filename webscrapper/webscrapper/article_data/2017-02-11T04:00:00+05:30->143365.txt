Mumbai: Two family-held firms of ousted   chairman   have challenged his removal as director at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) held on February 6 as “yet another act of oppression” by the corporate behemoth. The Mistry firms made this challenge before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Mumbai where its company petition for orders against Tata Sons for alleged acts of oppression and mismanagement is pending. The   had on January 31 clarified that it had not stayed the EGM scheduled for Mistry’s removal.

 The firms — Cyrus Investments and Sterling Investment Corporation — amended its pending petition as permitted by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in Delhi which had dismissed its appeal against denial of stay on the EGM. The NCLAT had also said that the Mumbai tribunal must hear and decide preliminary issues of maintainability first, then the plea for a waiver by the firms — which are minority shareholders of Tata Sons. The waiver is to a requirement of minimum 10 % equity shareholding to be able to petition the NCLT in an action for oppression and mismanagement. The tribunal can only then hear the matter on merits, the NCLAT had said.
 
 Tata Sons, meanwhile, has filed objections to the waiver plea saying, among other things, that the Mistry camp could not raise it at a belated stage, as it had done last month, despite filing its petition in December 2016. The issue of waiver attains importance now as the NCLAT said that if found the firms found eligible to petition or if the 10 % requirement is waived, the tribunal was at liberty to restore Mistry’s position as director of Tata Sons. The hearing is scheduled for February 13 in NCLT.
