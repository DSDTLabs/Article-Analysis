LUCKNOW: More than 500 turtles will find home in the Ganga in the coming week.

 While turtles would find a home, the   among the lot would prey on carcasses and half-burnt bodies, thus reducing pollution in the river. The turtles, that are presently lodged at the  , Varanasi, might be released in the   along the ghats of the Ganga next week or as soon as it gets a little warmer. The centre has 632 turtles but quite a few of them were rescued from poachers in such a condition that they may not survive.
 
 Most of the specimens were rescued by the Government Railway Police from trains where they were kept in bathrooms or underneath the berths, stacked in gunny bags, leaving some of them injured and ill.
 
 While the principal chief conservator of forest, Wildlife, UP has given the permission to release 235 turtles, the centre has sought permission to release 65 more specimens. Permission to release another 200 turtles will be sought soon.
 
 The turtle rehabilition centre and the sanctuary were set up under the Ganga Action Plan. It was decided in 1984 to release four carnivorous species of turtles in the Ganga for organic cleaning of the river. ‘Kathawa’ (Aspederites gangeticus), ‘Sundari Kachchua’ (Lissemys punctata), ‘Dhond’ (Kachuga dhongoka) and ‘Pacheda’ (Pangshura tecta) are carnivores that feed on burnt corpses. Turtle eggs from Chambal river were first hatched at the Sarnath breeding centre and kept in artificial ponds for about two years before being released in the sanctuary along the river.
 
 To accord protection to the turtles, the seven-km stretch of the river in Varanasi between Ramnagar fort and Malviya rail-road bridge was notified as a sanctuary in 1989. Since 1987, the breeding centre has released more than 42,000 turtles in the river. UP has the largest catchment area of turtles and the specimens are poached in huge numbers.
