KOLKATA: President   unveiled the   on Wednesday evening by unfurling the Tricolour on the flag mast of the car. The car had been used by Netaji   to engineer the Great Escape from his Elgin Road residence to Gomoh railway station, which is now in  .

 When the car had left the dimly lit corridor of 38/2 Elgin Road (which now houses the  ) on the night of January 16, 1941, it was dodging an entourage of British intelligence and police officers keeping a close watch on Subhas. He had escaped on the rear seat of the car disguised as Mohammad Ziauddin, an insurance agent.But when the car drove out of the annals of history on Wednesday, President Mukherjee and several officers were present to pay their respects to the “chariot of freedom”.
 
 “Sisir Bose was a personal friend of mine for several years and I know every nook and cranny of this place. When Krishna (Krishna Bose is Sisir Bose’s wife) requested me to be here on this day, I could not say no,” Mukherjee said. 
 
 The sedan was driven regularly till 1957 by Sugata’s father, Sisir Kumar Bose, who was at the wheel during Netaji’s escape from Kolkata. “I am told that I also went out on several drives in this historical car with my parents in the mid-fifties when I was a toddler,” Saugata Bose told President Mukherjee while he moved around the car and asked several questions about the mechanisms.
