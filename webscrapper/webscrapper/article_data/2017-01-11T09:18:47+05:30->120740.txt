NAGPUR: Call it a step that is seen as restraining Nagpur’s march towards turning into a  , ‘Swachhata MOUD’, an app launched last month wherein citizens can get their problems related to door-to-door  , sweeping of roads/streets and unhygienic public toilets addressed, has received a poor response. 

 Fifteen days after it was launched by the NMC in association with the ministry of urban development (MoUD), only 1,800 citizens have downloaded the app so far, confirmed a source from NMC’s health department. 
 
 Additional commissioner R Sonawane said the poor response for downloading the app might be for two reasons — either the citizens have no complaints related to city’s cleanliness or they don’t know how to navigate through the app. 
 
 Under this category, the NMC will score poor marks as the app is linked with Swachh Survekshan. Of the total 2,000 marks, 300 depend on complaints redressed and citizens’ feedback. Moreover, the MoUD had launched the app in August, but the NMC implemented it only in mid-December.
 
 Meanwhile, in view of the urban development ministry team reviewing the city’s sanitation scenario, the NMC has decided to organize zone-level cleanliness contests. 
 
 There will be inner competition among 145 wards in all the 10 zones. Among the 10 zones, the NMC will select most cleanliness zones. Housing societies who keep their premises clean will also be awarded.
 
 Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar and additional municipal commissioner R Sonawane reviewed the city’s preparation for the central team which will in city for three days from January 17.
