 Deputy commissioner of police (west Jaipur)   said the investigation is over and the police are planning to file the chargesheet against Priya, her boyfriend  , and friend   in coming weeks. Dushyant Sharma’s (27) body was found in a suitcase that was dumped at Kukas alongside the   highway on the night of May 3. The police found that he had met Seth on an online dating app following which she invited him to her house, held him captive and killed after a ransom of Rs 3 lakh was paid.
 
 The cops said that they will also elaborate how Sharma made several desperate attempts to flee from Priya’s captivity but in vain as the trio smashed beer bottles on his head, kicked him on the nose and slammed his face against the wall of their   flat.
 
 “There is a series of corroborative evidences which indicate the involvement of the trio in the crime,” said  , adding that some remaining evidences like slips and bills are to be recovered.
 
 The police in its investigation had found that a few minutes after Sharma came to her house, Priya asked him to come to the hall on the pretext of checking her television set which she claimed was not working properly. As soon as Sharma bent down to check the set, the trio tied him up with wires and attacked him. The trio was under the influence of cocaine at the time.
