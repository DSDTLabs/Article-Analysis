KOLHAPUR: The   ( ) has decided to take strict action against trollies for overloading sugarcane and not   on them.

 The Kolhapur district — known for its sugar industry — has sugar factories located on the outskirts. So, the trollies carrying cane to the factories need to take the highway in the night. Also, it has been seen that most of the trollies are overloaded. Hence, the RTO decided to take strict action against the traffic rule violators.
 
 Regional Transport Officer DT Pawar said, “The capacity of trollies depend upon its size. Most of the trollies carry sugarcane beyond their set capacity. They are not even equipped with reflectors. This could lead to an accident in the night. Many such incidents take place every year due to absence of reflectors. We cannot seize cane trollies but send notices regarding violations and they have to come up with the answers.”
 
 He added, “In the road safety fortnight campaign, we have arranged lectures for cane trolley drivers in sugar factories. We will guide them on disadvantages of overloading. We will even put up reflectors on their trollies. The weight of the cane starts decreasing after cut from field. If we seize the tractor, it will affect the recovery of farmers. So, the awareness among tractor owners is an option for us. We have already started the awareness programme with all sugar factories in the district.”
 
 Abhidyana Chougule, a city resident, said, “The trollies create traffic problems in the city. The load on trollies creates fear among bikers. It is difficult to deal with them and I have hardly seen any action against them by the traffic cops.”
