CHANDIGARH: Gurugram BJP MLA Umesh Aggarwal on Tuesday lashed out at his own party’s government and the town and country planning department on the issue of amendment to affordable housing project scheme in the 2031  . 

 Haryana finance minister  , who replied to the questions in the absence of chief minister  , admitted some lapses in the issuance of licences for affordable housing. He also assured appropriate action after completion of probe into the matter while responding to Aggarwal’s questions during the question hour in the state assembly.
 
 Aggarwal is one of the nine MLAs from southern Haryana to have spoken out against the government, alleging that they were being ignored by officers, ministers and the chief minister’s office (CMO). The number of dissidents has now gone up to 18.
 
 Aggarwal had asked if the government had made changes or increased the area of affordable housing project from 300 acres to 500 acres in the yet to be finalized Gurugram master plan for 2031. He asked whether any bias had been detected against any builder while issuing licences. 
 
 Abhimanyu asserted that there was no change in the Gurugram master plan. “There is always a scope for change in the infrastructure. The government has not received any complaint in the matter so far,” he maintained.
 
 Soon after Abhimanyu’s reply, Aggarwal expressed displeasure while elaborating on the complaint lodged by him with the Haryana CM and other offices in the matter. “I wonder how builders can prepare the draft ahead of the finalization of the policy. Complaints lodged by me are still pending at various levels. Neither the previous government, nor this one has ordered any probe to ascertain the shortcomings. They (builders) have been given the licences instead,” said Aggarwal.
