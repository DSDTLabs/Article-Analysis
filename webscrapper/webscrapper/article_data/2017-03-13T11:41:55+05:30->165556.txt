Director Pannaga Bharana’s post in favour of Dhananjaya on his social networking website page reads, “Dhananjaya - he is my actor & also a dear friend of mine... I have seen his dedication at work & passion to cinema 24/7... He had dedicated his 3yrs of life to one film & one person, that proves his passion .... A film maker should respect his actors n the art he loves... Today he happily sit & puts allegations on this actor but my question is where was he himself when the movie released... If he was true to his love his art which he calls it as  , he would have been out promoting the film Not sit aside n play such cheap gimmick but pre release fighting with producer & post release fighting with actors... Veteran film maker like To.S.Nagabharana casted him in the film allama but watching jayanagar 4th block not anything else In which   has proved how good of an actor he is... We as filmmakers not always look at the box office collection, ofcourse it plays a big role but still if that was the main concern then many good actors & good movies would have not been made at all Stop complaining about others n do ur work with full passion & COMMITMENT I can vouch on Dhanu anytime as he has done his best my film happy new year..!!! I support dhananjay 100%.” Pannaga has directed Dhananjaya in the upcoming movie Happy New Year.
