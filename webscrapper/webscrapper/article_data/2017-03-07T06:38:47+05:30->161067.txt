AHMEDABAD:   — popularly known as   — who died at the age of 112 in 2013 was honoured by the   (BSF) which named one of its Banaskantha outposts after him. The recognition reflected Pagi’s contribution to India in the wars against Pakistan in 1965 and 1971. But the Gujarat government, despite promises, could not even spare him 5 acres of land for his gallantry.

 On the desolate Indo-Pak border, Pagi used to sit on his haunches, peering into the horizon and poking the ground for signs of intrusion from Pakistan. The BSF, Army intelligence, RAW, and local police have gained critical intelligence on intruders from puggies (or trackers) like him. Most of his team members had died earlier.
 
 Pagi’s son Bababhai, who is a priest in Limbala village of Banaskantha, said: “My father served the country all his life.” Bababhai said honours his father received included a Rs 300 reward from General   after the 1971 war. “That was enough for us,” Bababhai said. “But in 2000, Keshubhai Patel — the chief minister at the time — promised us 5 acres of land and Narendrabhai repeated the promise in 2007 when he was the CM. The promises were not kept.”
 
 In 2014, the BSF named the outpost after Pagi but the state administration continued to show apathy towards his family. Pagi’s grandson Anil, who has been going from pillar to post to get the promised land, said that he has sent numerous applications to the district collectorate and to authorities in Gandhinagar. “The government should not have promised what it could not give,” Anil said. Police and paramilitary forces still hail Pagi’s successes. One of the most famous was the capture of the camel ‘Musharraf’ in 1998, which was carrying 22kg of RDX. In 1999, intruders from Pakistan were found with 24kg RDX near Bhagat Veri, and another 46kg was found buried in the Rann off Hajipir.
