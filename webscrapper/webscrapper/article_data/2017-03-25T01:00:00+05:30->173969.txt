 has a lot on her plate right now, but she is far from complaining. The actress, who was last seen in the 2016 film ' ', says that she has two goals as far as her work is concerned. “The first one is to reach out to the largest audience in my own capacity and the other is making work a lot of fun,” she elaborates. And it looks like Neha has managed to achieve both her goals with her presence on the small screen. She is one of the Gang Leaders in the reality show 

  and also one of the judges on the non-fiction show, Chhote Miyan. She says, “I can’t explain how much fun Roadies is. There is emotional turmoil and a certain attachment with your gang. We do everything from playing regular games to mind games. I don’t think I have laughed and cried on the same day at work as much as I have done on that show. On  , we are laughing all the time and I get paid to laugh. It also helps me reach out to the family audience, which is believed to be the hardest to please. With both these shows, I have all corners covered between youth and family.”
 
 That’s not all, the two shows also reflect her personality. While Roadies Rising helps her tap into her tough and fearless side, Chhote Miyan manages to bring out the fun and jovial girl in her. However, Neha maintains that she tries to be herself on both shows. “I always speak my mind, but the way I do it on both the programmes differs. On shows like these, you can’t put up an act. The only way to connect with the audience is by being yourself,” she signs off.
