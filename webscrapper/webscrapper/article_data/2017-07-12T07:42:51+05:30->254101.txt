Kolkata: The eastern zone bench of National Green Tribunal ( ) has directed the PWD to restore a waterbody along VIP Road between Sreebhumi and Golaghata that was filled up over the years to facilitate easier access of locals to their homes and establishments. The plot created after filling up the waterbody — locally known simply as   (Bengali for canal) — was also encroached, it was alleged by the Paschim   (PBBM), one of the petitioners. The other petitioner was Dwaipayan Sengupta. 

 The case was heard between 2015 and 2017 before the bench of Justice S P Wangdi and Prof P C Mishra passed its order on Monday. While PWD will restore the canal, South Dum Dum Municipality will be responsible for its maintenance and preservation. A compliance report will have to be submitted within four months. 
 
 “The NGT’s order was on the basis of a detailed report submitted by the   (WBPCB). Over the last two years, several maps — satellite and otherwise — of eight waterbodies in the area were also submitted. At the moment, we are still not sure what the original name of the waterbody to be restored is. While   has been directed to assist the PWD by removing high-tension wires and other utilities, two overbridges of sufficient height will have to be constructed at Golaghata and the Lake Town-VIP Road crossing,” said Arpita Chowdhury, counsel for WBPCB.
 
 Bigyan Mancha members have hailed Monday’s order as a first step towards sustainable development.
