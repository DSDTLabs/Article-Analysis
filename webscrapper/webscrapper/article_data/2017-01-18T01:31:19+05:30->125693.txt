Mumbai: The Bombay HC on Tuesday ordered a status quo to prevent further demolition of   in a 12-storey Santacruz (E) building after developer  , a part of Kamla group, said a regularization application was filed on January 16.

 Avdhut society had moved HC last year asking why BMC was not razing the illegal top floors despite issuing a notice. The BMC, in its compliance affidavit on Tuesday, said seven floors were legal and it had partly razed 8th, 10th, 11th and 12th (part) floors on January 12. Sanjay Singh, son of former Congress minister Kripashankar Singh who earlier lived in a duplex on the top floors, was present in court. 
 
 Karan Bhosale, the builder’s counsel, sought a status quo citi-ng the new regularization plea. Rahul Rao, counsel for the society, said he had no objection if the floors were regularized, but said the builder must pay property tax—over Rs 1 crore. The builder agreed. The HC told BMC to consider the regularization plea within six weeks and said if the builder doesn’t pay tax in three wee-ks, the status quo order would st-and vacated and BMC could take action.
