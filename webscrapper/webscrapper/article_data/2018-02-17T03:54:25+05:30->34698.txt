GURUGRAM:   have filed a petition in the district court, challenging an earlier order in favour of the developer who seeks to acquire a park in Block C for setting up a dispensary there.

 “We have filed an appeal in the additional district judge’s court. Over 6,000 families here are fighting to save a 1.2-acre park with 100 trees, including over 20-year-old trees, a playground and jogging tracks. The park is surrounded by two dozen homes, ironically branded and sold by the coloniser as ‘Green Meadows’ and high rise apartment complexes,” said  , a resident. The matter is likely to come up for hearing on Saturday.
 
 Last week, the residents had filed a complaint with the police and the forest department against an alleged bid by the developer to cut trees after two bulldozers crashed into the community park.
 
 The land in question has been earmarked for a dispensary. And despite the district court recently giving a ruling in favour of the developer in this regard, the residents said it had over 100 trees of protected species and thus a nod was required from the forest department to cut the same.
 
 “There is hardly any park left in the area. Our battle is to preserve a green lung. The developer, who is claiming that the land was meant for a dispensary, is set to hand over the park for building a multi-specialty hospital. There is already a functioning dispensary, just 200 metres away, and there are at least six large multi-specialty hospitals in the surrounding areas,” said another resident.
 
 Sushant Lok has been continuously losing its green spaces. Sources said a few sites reserved as green areas had already been used for setting up site offices, transformer rooms, grocery shops and milk booths, among others.
