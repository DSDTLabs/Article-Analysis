SHIVAMOGGA:   have two unusual guests to look after. Not complainants, not young lovers seeking protection and not politicians throwing their weight around. Two oxen saved from the sacrificial altar are in police custody and cops are protecting them till the local festival is over.

 Police said the villagers of   bought the two oxen to sacrifice them to village goddess   during the ongoing festival. But a few animal lovers came to know of the sacrifice and alerted the police. Bhadravathi rural police visited the village along with senior officials from the district administration and people’s representatives and requested the villagers not to sacrifice the oxen. When the villagers refused to relent, police forcibly “detained” the oxen. They plan to return them to their owners on Thursday; the festival concludes on Wednesday night.
 
 A senior officer told TOI that police had kept the oxen at an undisclosed location and were providing round-the-clock protection. “Villagers requested police to hand over the oxen at least for a procession and puja. But we didn’t hand the animals over. We have kept them at a secret location to ensure that villagers do not come over and try to pressure us. We are taking care of the oxen,” he said. Miffed locals said police had arrived in large numbers and transported the oxen in a canter.
