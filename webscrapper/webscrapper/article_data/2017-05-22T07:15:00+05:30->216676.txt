GURUGRAM: Many have heard of the triathlon, an endurance event in which participants run, swim and ride (on a cycle). On Sunday, the city played host to a ‘duathlon’.

 Getting up early on a Sunday may not be to everyone’s taste but   enthusiasts are another breed altogether. So at 5:30 am sharp, the ‘Fitso   Challenge’ got under way synchronously at Leisure Valley and Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park. Uniquely, the ‘Challenge’ was organised on the ground and ‘virtually’ – in the latter, folks could run and ride at a location convenient to them (the winners were announced by comparing the results of each ‘set’ of duathletes).
 
 Taking part were around 200   and some 400 people from Delhi. First up, participants embarked on a 5km run, following it up with a 20km ride, before bringing their stamina-sapping morning to a close with another 5km run. 
 
 Everyone had to submit a tracking screenshot of each of the three events, to be judged to have completed the duathlon. And to Yashish Dahiya – CEO, Policy Bazaar – went the spoils. He took 19:32, 32:02 and 18:20 minutes to cover, respectively, the 5km on feet, 20km on pedals and, again, the 5km. “It’s awesome to have the nascent triathlon community participate in such virtually coordinated events,” shared Dahiya. 
 
 According to Gaurav Makkar – fitness coach at Fitso and 3X Ironman – the triathlon is the “real” deal. “With so many running events around, fitness has only become focused on running or six-pack abs. But the triathlon is a multiple-stage race involving the completion of three continuous and sequential endurance disciplines, in immediate succession and over various distances,” he said. 
 
 Makkar is hoping such events will help grow a community of triathletes – maybe even an elite of ‘Ironmen’. Next on the cards is an ‘Olympic distance’ triathlon.
 
 Incidentally, Fitso is a mobile app that acts as your ‘health and weight loss’ personal coach. It was founded by a trio of IIT Delhi graduates.
