 Be it conversations over a cup of tea or discussions on social media, we get to hear opinions of all kinds about the government as well as candidatures in the run-up to every election. For many, it’s more than just voicing their opinion; it’s about displaying a sense of patriotism for the country. But if we don’t actually step out of the house to cast our vote on the day of election, it’s the highest form of betrayal that we are showcasing. 
 
  The policies that the elected government make are going to directly affect our day-to-day life. So, it’s important that, as informed citizens, we take a wise decision and vote for the appropriate candidates. The people who are at the helm of affairs should be everyone’s concern. People who don’t act up now should not come to the fore later complaining about things. 
 
  It’s good to see that the younger generation of voters are less cynical about the electoral process, compared to the older generations. This gives hope for a more positive future. Social media could be used as a strong medium to spread the word and bolster participation. Also as members of a civilised society, we expect to see a less violent and more peaceful election, the results of which will lead to further development of our state and country.
