KOLKATA: Officers probing the alleged   inside a   last week said they have come across new angles that need immediate investigation. The student was allegedly  .

 The fresh review became necessary after the girl recorded her CrPC 161statement before the investigating officer and police collected statements from those “attached to the school”.
 
 “We have incorporated IPC Section 506 (criminal intimidation) in the FIR along with two sections of Pocso. The girl has been able to recount before us how the accused had tried to threaten her into submission and then molested her. This is one aspect that needs further probing to ascertain if there was any negligence on part of anyone,” an officer said. He said school functionaries will be asked to record statements to verify the child’s complaints.
  
  
 The developments came on the same day the police said they were satisfied with the fresh security arrangements made by the south Kolkata school where the incident led to major protests last week. Officers on Thursday said they had made certain suggestions to increase security at the school. “They plan to set up 48 CCTV cameras in two blocks, 40 of which will be installed at places we suggested,” a police officer said.
 
 The kid’s mother was satisfied with the progress of the probe. “I am grateful to everyone, including those who stood by us on that day. We will never support violence in school and Iam hoping my child will receive support from the authorities once she resumes classes. I have no complaints against the school except for the fact that they had initially delayed taking action against the teacher despite bringing my daughter and the suspect face to face,” she said.
