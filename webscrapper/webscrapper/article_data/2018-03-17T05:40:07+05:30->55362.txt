LUDHIANA: Having no data of its own on illegal colonies, the municipal corporation ( ) is going to start an exercise next month to reach an exact figure on such illegal hamlets which have mushroomed in the city.

 The MC has, of late, cracked the whip on illegal colonies, and announced to act against 79 developers of such settlements. To date, the MC had not conducted even a single survey and had been depending on data collected by the Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority ( ). Basically, it had no data on illegal colonies to call its own. 
 
 MC assistant town planner (headquarters) S S   said they were finally starting a survey as the local bodies department had recruited more staff. “As soon as we get more manpower, we will begin this survey on priority,” he said.
 
 In a recent survey, Glada came to know that the number of illegal colonies in the city number had increased from 1,800 to 1,930 in the district. The figure for within the limits of the MC was 1,441, which is the highest for a civic body in the state. 
 
 A source in the MC said the civic body had no complete record of illegal colonies and their developers. “When the first regularization policy was launched in 2013, officials had estimated there were 300 illegal colonies within MC limits, but they received applications from 110 developers only. Even out of these 110, officials could not catch hold of 79 developers. It is after passing of almost five years the officials are reminded of taking action against the colonizers,” the source said.
 
 Officials blamed lack of manpower for the problem, saying that they had always kept an eye on wrongdoings and demolished all illegally constructed colonies.
