NAVI MUMBAI: An animal activist from   has initiated the first-ever online beauty   for Indie dogs and cats. 

 The initiative, launched this week, is the brainchild of   who has been involved in rescuing strays for over five years now. As a dog lover, she feels the Indie breed has been often neglected and believes that they make the best   and watch dogs.
 
 The idea came to her after she saw an Indie kitten up for adoption on one of the social media groups. “There are so many homes that adopt these unwanted animals, and the best part is the difference it can bring to them.” 
 
 The contest is open to owners and rescuers not just from Navi Mumbai, but also from Mumbai and Thane. “All participants in this contest have to simply send in pictures or videos of their pet. You can even be part of the audience and vote for each category. Even donations are welcome. All funds will go towards emergency costs for uncared cats and dogs,” said Rinki.
 
 The contest will open for around two months after which the winners will be decided. She feels spacing out the event was important since owners might want to play around with photos and videos. 
 
 Those who wish to participate have to connect with the organisers through a registered mobile number. “They will then be connected to the online platform, the Only Indie Beauty Pageant. We don’t want people to make a mockery of these animlas and so those interested should specify if they want to be part of the audience or a participant. With four categories and prizes for cats and dogs in each of them, a total of eight prizes will be awarded,” Rinki said.
