PANAJI: Lashing out at the government for calling a day’s assembly session, opposition leader Pratapsingh Rane said it’s an “unprecedented situation.” It could be “probably, the first case in the country,” Rane said addressing a press conference on Monday. There is no point in calling a session when the business advisory committee meeting has not been held, he said.

 “No business advisory meeting has been held,” said opposition leader pointing out a prerequirement for summing a session. “We don’t know what business will be conducted,” said Rane adding, he received the notice about summoning of the 15th session of the sixth legislative assembly on Tuesday.
 
 After a debate for more than two weeks, the governor summoned a special session on Tuesday, February 28, to keep the continuity going for at least one session within six months.
 
 Governor   will address the house at 11.30am. “After transacting formal business, if any, the assembly will be adjourned sine die,” said Rane, reading from the agenda received.
 
 Rane said opposition members will not able to reply to the governor’s address. “This is not democracy. This is misuse of democracy for one’s selfishness.”
 
 Rane also raised a doubt whether government has power to convene when the code of conduct has not been revoked.
 
 The opposition had demanded that House be dissolved and President’s rule imposed until next government takes its reigns. Asked whether the opposition will attend Tuesday’s session, Rane said he will hold a discussion to arrive at a decision.
 
 Congress’   was equally critical of the   government. “They (BJP) have no face to call assembly now,” said Lourenco.
