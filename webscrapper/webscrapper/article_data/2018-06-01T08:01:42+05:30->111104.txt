BENGALURU: The CBI on Thursday conducted searches against aides of   and   and his brother-MP DK Suresh in connection with a   Rs 10 lakh of demonetized currency in Ramanagara by fabricating requisition slips.

 
 This comes nine months after the income tax department raided the brothers in an alleged illegal wealth case.
 
 Sources said the CBI obtained search warrants against 11 confidants of Shivakumar and Suresh by late Wednesday evening, and raided five locations belonging to four people by Thursday morning. A search warrant against Suresh’s personal assistant Padmanabhaiah, one of the prime accused in the case, has also been secured.
 
 As soon as the news broke out, the Congress leaders held a press meet in the city at 8am and alleged that their names had been dragged into the case at the behest of the Centre and BJP. Suresh said they were under constant pressure from the saffron outfit to “join them” or “face consequences”.
 
 DKS to BJP: Power is not permanent
 
 DK Shivakumar on Thursday issued a warning to the central government, saying power was not permanent for any party. “I’d like to appeal to the agencies involved in foisting false cases on us to not become puppets in the hands of a few people...” he added.
