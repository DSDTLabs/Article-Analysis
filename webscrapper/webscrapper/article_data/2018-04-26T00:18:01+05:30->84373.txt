Villupuram: Violence erupted in various parts of Villupuram district in the early hours of Wednesday after unidentified people desecrated a statue of Dr B R Ambedkar at Murukeri village. 

 The statue of the dalit icon was garlanded with slippers. As the news spread, hundreds of people took to the streets setting up roadblocks. 
 
 The Tindivanam-Marakkanam Road was blocked and slogans demanding arrest of the accused were raised. 
 
 Unidentified people pelted stones at government buses, with passengers onboard the vehicles, near the Trivandrum overbridge. Although no one was injured, seven government buses were damaged. Road transport was temporarily suspended to avoid any further incident. 
 
 Officials from the Brahmadesam police station rushed to the spot and took charge of the situation. As per local sources, the police removed the garlanded slippers and registered a case in this regard.
 
 Apprehending that the situation might take an ugly turn, more than 200 police personnel headed by Villupuram SP S Jayakumar and three DSPs, including Tindivanam DSP Thirumal, Kotakuppam DSP Elangovan and DSP for crime against women Muthumanickam, were deployed at the spot. They carried out special patrols to avert any untoward incidents.
