BELAGAVI: The   prevented over   in the district in 2016. 

 This performance is better compared to the previous year when the department had rescued 62 underage girls from entering the wedlock. Despite this,   continues to be a matter of concern in areas bordering Maharashtra.
 
 Yaadi Mein Shaadi, a tradition in which a marriage is conducted overnight, has become a big challenge for officials. No invitation cards are printed and very few guests are invited to the wedding that takes place late in the night. TJ Lokesh, district child protection officer, said that girls in the 12-17 age group especially in scheduled tribes Sudugaad Siddha and Uppar and some   off by their parents under this tradition. 
 
 This is more prevalent in taluks of Raibag, Chikkodi, Nippani and Athani. Some of these communities are also holding the weddings in Maharashtra making it even more difficult for the authorities to prevent them. PDOs, anganwadi workers and schoolteachers who involve in rescuing the brides also face threat from the villagers. Since 2011 the department has prevented over 400 child marriages.
