BENGALURU:   has acquired mobiles and IT products service chain  , the company announced on Tuesday. The e-commerce major's move to take over the fiveyear-old company comes on the back of Flipkart's strategy to strengthen its after-sales services for the smartphone and electronics category.

 He said the acquisition will help Flipkart service secondhand phones that come from users who opt for exchange programmes, while buying new products on the platform. The 150 centres will be open to consumers who may have bought a phone from rival online marketplaces as well.
 
 F1Info's team of about 900 people comprises mostly technicians. The company has partnerships with leading brands like Apple,  , HP, Lenovo, Sony and Asus. Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy said, “F1Info Solutions is an entrenched player in this segment, and its expertise and scale is a big capability add-on for us.
