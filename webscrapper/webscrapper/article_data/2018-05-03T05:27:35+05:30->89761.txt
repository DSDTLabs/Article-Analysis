LONDON: An Indian-origin businesswoman managed to travel from UK’s   to New Delhi via Dubai on her husband’s passport before the serious security lapse was picked up in India, prompting the   to launch an investigation into the incident.

 
 Geeta Modha, who runs Alankar boutique in Rusholme area of Manchester, left for the airport with husband Dilip’s passport by mistake for a business trip on April 23. The 55-year-old was able to check-in and board the flight and was waved through a stopover at Dubai on to New Delhi before the error was picked up, according to ‘Manchester Evening News’.
 
 As a holder of Overseas Indian Citizenship, Geeta was expected to produce her passport at Delhi immigration and was denied entry to India at that point. “It’s scary and worrying that people aren’t checking properly,” she told the newspaper.
 
 Indian authorities made Geeta travel back to Dubai to wait for her own passport, which was flown to her by Emirates. “We work closely with our airport handlers to ensure that all regulations relating to passport checks is taken very seriously. In this instance our usual high standards were not followed and we would like to apologise,” a spokesperson of the airline said.
