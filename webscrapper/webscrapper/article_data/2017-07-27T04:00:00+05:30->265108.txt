Ahmedabad: National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rescued 69 people including 10 women and 15 children from Ganol village in Dholka taluka, Ahmedabad on Wednesday. The team also rescued about six goats from the village totally inundated with floodwater from Sabarmati river.

 NRDF officials said they had called in rescue teams from Chotila and had stationed them in Ahmedabad in anticipation of floods following the release of water from Dharoi dam which had increased the flow in Sabarmati river to around 1.24 cusec since yesterday.
 
 On Wednesday, officials swung into action after receiving a call about a person drowning and need of immediate rescue operations. “We reached the spot and found water surrounding the houses and people clinging to branches of trees to save themselves,” said an official, adding, “We found water level continuing to increase and at one point it was about 12 feet high.
 
 The team tried to rescue the stranded people but they refused to cooperate unless their cattle, including goats and buffaloes were also rescued. The team then began rescuing the cattle. While goats could be taken on boats, it was impossible to make space for buffaloes, so a person brought the buffaloes out of water through a safe road.
 
 NDRF said there were more people stranded in the area and they are trying hard to convince them to evacuate before water level increases. Meanwhile, the team of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) stationed at Dholka rescued six patients who needed urgent care.
 
 Collector Avantika Singh Aulakh said that 3,858 people from 20 villages have been rescued by the district administration after water released from the Sabarmati river entered these villages.
