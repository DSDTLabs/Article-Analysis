NEW DELHI:  , former inspector general of Bastar known for controlling armed   insurgency in the area during his tenure, is likely to attend   celebrations at   on August 15.
 
  This comes months after Kalluri addressed a controversial seminar at the Indian institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), less than a kilometre from  , where a group of students had staged a protest.
  
  “He is definitely coming,” said assistant professor Buddha Singh, confirming Kalluri has accepted an invitation from a group of students and faculty members. “We are in the process of coordinating with his security officers to ensure his smooth entry into the campus,” he told ET.
  
  A 1994-batch IPS officer, Kalluri is often credited with controlling armed Maoist insurgency in Bastar during his tenure by weaning away tribals from the rebels, ‘empowering’ locals to speak out against violence, and with infrastructure development. “He has dealt with over 800 cases of Naxals and controlling Maoism in Chhattisgarh, it is a matter of pride,” said Singh who is also the dean of students’ welfare at JNU.
  
  Kalluri, however, is also accused of conducting fake encounters and targeting human rights lawyers, tribal leaders and activists during his tenure and it is this reputation of his that sparked off protests by some faculty members and students of IIMC when he was invited to address a media seminar on ‘nationalistic journalism’.
  
  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had recently pulled up the Chhattisgarh government for human rights violation in the state and released a report on 16 tribal women who were raped and physically assaulted by police personnel in restive Bijapur district during Kalluri’s tenure.
  
  Incidentally, Kalluri had also accused JNU student Umar Khalid of conspiring against him in February 2016 when Khalid mentioned the blind attack on Chhattisgarh Adivasi activist Soni Sori last year.
