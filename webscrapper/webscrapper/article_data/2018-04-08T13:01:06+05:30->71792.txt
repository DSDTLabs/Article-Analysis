Love in   is fast becoming rarer than hits. The latest relationship to crumble is the eight-year one between Joy and Sayantika. Almost spelt in the same breath, the duo was considered inseparable at one point. They started out together, did commercial potboilers like Target, Hangover, Mone Pore Aajo Shedin before Joy opted for the small screen and   stuck around in films. So, what went wrong? While no one knows it better than the two of them, I hear there was trouble in their paradise after  , a megaserial starring Joy, ended in 2016. After that, there was a long wait for a good role to come his way and issues started cropping up in the relationship that so far looked like a bed of roses. In his private circle of friends, Joy pointed out how he was let down by an actress’ husband, whose marriage was a secret till recently. Joy had apparently given money to the husband as an investment, something he never recovered when he needed it the most.

 Cracks were already showing in the relationship between the two couples, who were each other’s secret keepers. Joy’s calls were blocked and eventually the friends parted ways over the obvious — money. The two actresses, who were two bodies one soul till then, also had a massive showdown over a birthday present to a powerful producer after the producer made his preference known. In the bouquet of films announced by the production house this year, Sayantika is nowhere to be seen. And looks like Joy is both out of sight and out of mind for the Bengali audience. Sometimes, it might hurt to walk away, but it’s nothing compared to the pain of staying together.
