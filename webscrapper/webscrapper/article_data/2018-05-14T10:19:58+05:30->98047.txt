HYDERABAD: Next time you see a child with crooked teeth, a long face or a weak chin, do not think its natural. Breathing through the mouth at night may cause   to the face.

 
 The problem is prevalent in cities and Hyderabad is no exception, say experts. Symptoms are visible in children when growing, and corrections can be made quickly during this phase. Left untreated, it may lead to abnormal, unwanted dental and facial developments. Thumb sucking and nail biting can lead to irregular teeth growth, said Dr P Bal  , former principal of  .
 
 “Children breathe through their mouths because of growth of adenoids inside the nose, which lead to nose blocks. Nasal or septal deviation at the nose wall will result in blockade of one nostril. Sinusitis also causes blocked noses,” he said.
 
 “Air in the cities is filled with several dust particles. When breathed through the mouth, they go inside unfiltered and come out of mouth with force, altering the course of teeth growth, causing changes in the face,” Bal Reddy told TOIon Sunday.
 
 To repair the situation, parents should not resort to   of their wards. Instead they should take the help of orthodontists.
 
 The reasons for nose blockades in children should be identified and proclined teeth problems should be corrected medically. Then children should be taught to breathe through nose.
 
 Modern methods like oral screening can be adopted to make children breathe through their noses. But this method should be adopted only after removing the original problem that is causing nose blockades.
