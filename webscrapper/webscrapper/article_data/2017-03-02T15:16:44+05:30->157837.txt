AHMEDABD: Anti Corruption Bureau's ( ) raid on Mansukh K Shah, chairman of Sumandeep Vidyapith, busted a huge scam of meritless paid admissions at the medical college. 

 A doctor couple filed a complaint with the ACB, following which the bureau raided Shah. ACB found 220 cheques worth Rs 102 crores and seized receipts of fixed deposit of Rs 43 crores. Property worth more than one crore, including a Mercedes,  ,   was also found. ACB has also uncovered a huge amount of cash from accomplices' residences. 
 
 ACB also arrested his accomplices Bharat Sawant and Ashok Tailor. Another accomplice Dr Dhruvil Shah is absconding. 
 
 ACB received more than 100 calls in the last 24 hours from the parents who complained that Shah conferred degrees to doctors' kids who hardly attended classes. Medical mafia's daughter and son-in-law too are going to get P.G medical degree from the college. 
 
 Mansukh K Shah's   was famous with doctors whose kids did not score well in senior secondary exams. After completing MBBS from this self finance college, these doctors' kids enrolled in Vaghodiya Medical College for post graduate degree, for which Shah used to charge a huge amount. Doctors paid it willingly. 
 
 Many politicians' kids also received degrees from this college. Shah received Rs 110 crores as fees and Rs 170 crores as donation per year. 
 
 The college gave admission without merit, clearly violating orders of the University Grant Commission that ordered strict monitoring of admission process in self-finance colleges and deemed universities.
 
 A prominent BJP leader, a Member of Parliament, and a Gujarat University union leader were associated with Sumandeep College when it was established.
