KOLKATA: At least 12 persons, including three kids, were injured when two private buses trying to overtake each other lost control and rammed into a stationary bus at Action Area II of   on Friday evening.

 
 Sources said the brakes werenâ€™t effective as it was raining heavily and the road was slippery. All the injured were admitted to a private hospital in New Town. Both the buses have been seized but their drivers and conductors are absconding.
 
 According to a witness, a bus towards Eco Space was standing below a bridge near DLF II for passengers when one of the two buses coming from the New Town police station end rammed into it. Soon, the third bus hit the second bus from behind.
