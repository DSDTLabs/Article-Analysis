 Blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies, but it is now seen to have applications across finance, smart contracts and managing digital identities.

This enables parties in a contract to have greater confidence, and where enforcement of contracts has required intermediaries, blockchain obviates the need for them, making processes much more fast and efficient.
