AHMEDABAD: A sweet nostalgia swept over the 40-odd senior bureaucrats and academicians who had gathered in a hotel conference room as   of the   ( ) on Sunday for their second   (AAJ) Gujarat and   meeting, on Sunday.

 Chief secretary J N Singh, ACS Sangeeta Singh, and development commissioner, Mundra port, Amiya Chandra were among the officers present. It was a trip down the memory lane for many, who shared their nostalgic narratives of the years spent on the JNU campus. The alumni met with past students who are teachers at Central University of Gujarat (CUG), Cept University, Gujarat University, and even schools.
 
 
 “JNU has always been known for its intellectual strength and has been the hub of free thinkers,” said chief secretary Singh. “I was a student of the School of International Studies and I remember quite starkly how we are nurtured by some of the best teachers in this country. The campus inspired us to be innovative and made us respect a wide range of ideologies.”
 
 Additional DGP K K Ojha recalled the days spent with his friends at the Jhelum hostel. “At JNU I realized the true strength of ideas. The university teaches you to put forth your point of view while respecting the viewpoint of others,” said Ojha. “There is a popular saying on the campus, which is Knowledge is Free, but Bhojan is chargeable!” Ojha also put forth a proposition before the alumni to think of an actionable plan to fight and root out casteism. “I propose a movement where we can get rid of our surnames that reflects our castes,” Ojha said.
