LUCKNOW: After a lot of back and forth, police on Sunday booked SP leader   for allegedly rioting and attacking the staff of a restaurant in   on Saturday afternoon. 

 A former student leader at Lucknow University, Rana was given the status of a state minister by the government around two years ago. 
 
 The restaurant owner has given CCTV footage of the incident to the police but nobody has been arrested even 24 hours later.
 
 Rana went to the restaurant in Vivek Khand along with 15 to 20 on Saturday afternoon. His associates had been camping at Kalidas Marg since morning and reached the restaurant in three different four-wheelers around 3.30pm. 
 
 After their meal, waiter Sonu presented the bill before Rana. It amounted to about Rs 5,400.
 
 “Rana turned hostile, saying he would not be able to foot so much,” said Babloo Singh, the manager of the restaurant.
 
 Rana and his men started to leave without paying and Sonu confronted them outside the restaurant again. This time, Rana allegedly slapped the waiter. As other restaurant staffers began collecting, a brawl ensued and Rana and his group barged inside the restaurant and vandalized it.
 
 By the time police arrived, the group had left. Restaurant owner Vivek Kumar Mishra lodged an FIR in Gomtinagar police station. However, police tried to broker peace between the two sides before that.
 
 Station house officer Madhur Mishra said sections amounting to robbery, rioting, violence and trespass, among others, had been registered against Rana and the unidentified group. 
 
 “We will examine the footage and take action against the others,” said Mishra.
