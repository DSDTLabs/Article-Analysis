Nagpur: Stressing the importance of Jyotiba Phule’s teachings, Pralhad Lulekar, a writer and examination controller at Sandip University, Nashik, said, “Mahatma   was a great politician. We need to embrace Phule’s vision of a humanist society.”

 He was speaking at   memorial lecture series organized by Nagpur University(NU) at Gramgeet Bhavan, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Shaikshanik Parisar on Monday. The topic of the lecture was ‘Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Yanchya Vicharanche Vartaman Kalat Mahatva’. Lulekar discussed Phule’s contribution in education. “Education is the backbone of any country. If the government cannot provide enough jobs, it should at least provide affordable education.” 
 
 Phule had suggested a reduction in the cost of higher education and primary education to everyone almost two centuries ago. It shows his vision for the development, Lulekar added. “He always wanted to empower women. He believed that they were the most exploited class. He started many schools and funded scholarships for women,” he said. Puranchandra Meshram, registrar, NU, was the chief guest at the programme. He said, “Phule was the first to suggest reservation for deprived class in the  . However, it was rejected by the then British government. Later,   accepted the idea and provided reservation in jobs for the backward classes.”
