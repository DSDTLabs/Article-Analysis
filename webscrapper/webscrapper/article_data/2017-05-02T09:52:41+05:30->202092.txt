MUMBAI: Three years after being arrested for attempting to murder his wife by throwing kerosene and setting her alight, a man has now been   after the wife who suffered 10% burns told the court that she had actually sustained the injuries while cooking. 

 In her cross examination by the defence, the woman said that she wanted to teach her  , Kanhaiyalal Kanojia, a lesson for a quarrel they had earlier. While the court held that it could not be ruled out that the woman was trying to save her husband, it observed that the other evidence was not enough to convict him.
 
 “There remains the uncertainty as to exactly which version of the first informant (woman) is correct and can be relied upon as there are self-contradictory versions. Thus, it needs to be observed that testimony of the woman is not reliable and trustworthy,” the court said. 
 
 The alleged incident took place on April 15, 2014. The woman said that she had returned home from work and had dinner with her brother and children. She claimed that at 11 pm her husband returned home drunk and her children and brother were asleep. She said that when she served him food, he threw away the plate, demanded fresh food and abused her. She starting preparing food, when her husband suddenly threw kerosene on her. She thought that he was joking and she went to wash her hands, but he then lit a cigarette with a match stick and threw the burning match stick on her. She suffered burns on her hands and stomach and shouted for help. Her brother rescued her and rushed her to the hospital. After treatment, she lodged an FIR with the Agripada police. The man was arrested but he denied the incident.
