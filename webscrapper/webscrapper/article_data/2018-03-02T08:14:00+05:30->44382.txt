MOHALI: The residents of Purab Premium Apartments in Sector 88 of   have alleged that   rule the housing society and they avoid going out of their houses during nights out of fear.

 Parwinder Singh and  , members of  , said they have given written complaints to the police, but no action has been taken.
 
 Parwinder Singh said, “There are no checks by the security agency as any unknown person can enter the society and live in the society. Such miscreants create panic among the residents as they create ruckus, drink in open and break the liquor bottles inside the premises. If the residents try to stop them, they assault them. Recently my father was assaulted and roughed up by some of the tenants when they were asked to adhere to the housing society norms.”
 
 He said a few months ago, the residents had submitted   footage of miscreants seen playing loud music in their car, standing and dancing on the roof of the vehicle while drinking in the open.
 
 Sunil Kumar said, “We are permanent residents of the housing society and have constituted set norms for the dwellers. One has to give their identity proof to the security guards which are further submitted with the area police station. But many tenants resist to give their identity proofs and most of them are either working with event management company or Punjabi video production houses. And they are ones who generally violate law and order situations.”
 
 They said the resident welfare committee has also lodged a complaint with GMADA for poor security arrangements and missing streetlights in the vicinity of the housing society but they too have not taken any action on their complaints.
