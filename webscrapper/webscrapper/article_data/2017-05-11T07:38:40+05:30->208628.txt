CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party's internal crisis deepened on Wednesday after its former Punjab convener   (Ghuggi) quit the party. Speaking to reporters in Chandigarh, he said party supremo   was "careless" and "incapable of fixing accountability" for the electoral defeats. 

  Waraich ditched AAP two days after Kejriwal replaced him with Sangrur MP   as the new Punjab chief. He even said that Mann's promise to Kejriwal of staying away from liquor was "laughable". He accused Kejriwal of taking the decision to remove him following his "nagging" requests to visit Punjab for a thanksgiving tour, the electoral defeat notwithstanding. 
 
 AAP had been claiming that it would win 90 of the 117 seats in the Punjab assembly in the recently concluded polls, but got just 20 seats.
 
  Waraich is the first Punjab leader to resign from the party after the results. Bholath MLA and former Congress spokesperson   resigned as AAP's chief whip two days ago. Waraich's decision is a big blow to AAP given that it has come at a time when the Delhi unit is mired in controversies and Kejriwal himself is facing allegations of corruption. 
 
  "I want to tell Arvind Kejriwal that I have felt humiliated with the way I have been removed. I have been made the scapegoat for bad (Punjab election) results even though I took up leadership at a later stage. I could have been told I was fired on the phone. That is how Kejriwal had appointed me as convener - he had called up while I was addressing a rally in Amritsar," Waraich told TOI later .
