MYSURU: The district administration will seek clarification from the authorities of Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms (DPAR) and the regional passport office over the protocol breach of not inviting district minister for the launch of Passport Seva Centre (PSC) recently.

 The ministry of external affairs and   had launched the PSC at Metagalli, but without inviting district minister H C Mahadevappa for the inaugural programme. The event was held on January 25 (Wednesday) when chief minister Siddaramaiah chaired   (KDP) review meeting at the regional commissioner’s office meeting hall. During the meeting, Siddaramaiah vent his ire against regional passport officials for not inviting Mahadevappa for the launch, saying it is a sheer violation of protocol. The authorities had invited MLA Vasu and mayor   for the programme.
 
 Siddaramiah said that MPs are invited to state government programmes. “(Similarly), the authorities concerned from the central government, as a protocol, should invite ministers and elected representatives from the state coming under its jurisdiction for their programmes,” he said. 
 
 The chief minister had also warned   to ensure that such incidents do not recur. The DC is the authority in the district to ensure that the protocol is followed strictly.
 
 Taking the matter seriously, Randeep has decided to seek clarification from the authorities of DPAR, which is responsible for following protocol procedures, and the regional passport centre.
 
 “The CM had expressed displeasure over the protocol breach. So on Monday, I’m calling the authorities in the regional passport office to collect information regarding the programme. Invitation cards of the PSC launch programme will be verified and the circular by GoI will be checked. Statements from the authorities concerned will also be taken. As it is a Union government programme, I will seek clarification from DPAR,” Randeep added.
