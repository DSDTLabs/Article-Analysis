NEW DELHI: Accusing Prime Minister   of "hiding behind power" as his "lies" were getting exposed,   president   on Sunday said the party was on a comeback trail and would win Karnataka as well as year-end assembly elections in three   strongholds.

 
 Speaking at the ‘Jan Aakrosh' rally, Rahul raised his pitch to a shrill tone to say, "Modi managed to escape in Gujarat elections by the skin of his teeth. Now, you see what the Congress worker does in Karnataka. We will win there, and then we will also win in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh."
 
 Rahul said RSS-BJP had spread lies about "our government" and Modi had spread lies about Congress and its leaders, suggesting it was the reason behind UPA's massive defeat in 2014. "But the truth, Modi's reality, is coming out," he added.
 
 The claim, cheered by the gathering, came amid the ongoing Karnataka campaign and Rahul effecting organisational changes in faction-ridden states which will go to the hustings in November. These four states will set the tone for the 2019 Lok Sabha mega battle, a reason why Rahul used his speech to raise the morale of party workers.
 
 "Congress worker… woh sher ka bachcha hai, sher ka bachcha. No matter how much you oppress him, he will fight for truth," Rahul said in a rhetorical tone.
 
 The Congress chief's 30-minute speech was a bitter assault on the arch rival as he blamed the "chowkidar" for maintaining silence on rising rapes, corruption allegations, flight of Nirav Modi and the failure to fulfil election promises on jobs and black money. He also accused the government of filling all institutions with RSS sympathisers.
