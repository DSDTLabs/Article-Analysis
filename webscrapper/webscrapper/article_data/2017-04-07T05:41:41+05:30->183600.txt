AMARAVATI: The   cabinet met for the first time on Thursday after the reshuffle and saw chief minister   sitting down with his new ministers to pave way for several changes in the state. 

 To pump life back into the construction sector, the cabinet cleared a draft bill to bring amendments to the AP building rules. "The cabinet has directed the municipal administration department to prepare detailed guidelines for the new AP land development rules. The rules will ensure there is no hardship in development of layouts or construction of houses," information minister   said. Naidu directed the department to step up surveillance to prevent illegal layouts and structures. 
 
 The cabinet also decided to make online applications for layout and building plans mandatory. No civic body would accept the hard copy of the plans, the minister said. 
 
 The cabinet also cleared amendments to the sale deed in favour of Hero Motors Ltd, which is setting up its plant in Chittoor. APIIC was allowed to change the deed as sought by Hero, which is investing 1,600 crore into the plant. 
 
 Naidu also directed ministers and officials to meet the drinking water needs during the summer. He asked chief secretary Dinesh Kumar to monitor the situation and told ministers to review the situation in their districts. Following a suggestion by panchayat raj minister Lokesh, the government decided to set up a toll-free number to tackle water-related complaints.
