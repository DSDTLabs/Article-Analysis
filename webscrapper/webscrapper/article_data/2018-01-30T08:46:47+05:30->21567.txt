RAJKOT: Two   in Rajkot on Monday morning. Police said   alias Tabudi (30) and Akash Babaria (30), both   in Rajkot, were caught on basis of suspicion from Navalnagar area on Monday morning. 

 “The duo was detained as both had covered their faces with handkerchiefs while riding a bike. We found two knives on them. During interrogation, they confessed to 24 crimes of chain snatching and two vehicle thefts in past five months,” assistant commissioner of police (west division) Harshad Mehta said. 
 
 Police recovered gold chains worth Rs 1.25 lakh from their residences. “The accused duo had broken the chains into pieces, hence we could not ascertain the number of stolen chains,” Mehta added. Last week, on Friday, the duo had robbed a woman of her gold chain worth Rs 45,000 near Vrindavan Society. 
 
 Shakti has earlier been arrested in various cases, including murder, loot and 37 chain snatching cases, while Akash has been booked in 15 cases of chain snatching and one attempt to murder.
