SURAT: Power loom weavers and textile traders are upset over a tweet by CMO-Gujarat on GST rate cut on polished diamonds. 

 In a tweet, CMO Gujarat has posted an artwork carrying pictures of Prime Minister   on the top and chief minister   and deputy chief minister   at the bottom, congratulating the diamond industry of Surat for the major benefit due to GST rate cut on polished diamonds and valuable gemstones from 3% to 0.25% on Friday. 
 
 This tweet has gone viral on WhatsApp groups of the textile fraternity in the city asking Rupani and his government whether they considered Surat a textile city or not? 
 
 Power loom weavers and traders in the countryâ€™s largest man-made fabric (MMF) sector in the city are highly disappointed that the GST Council has again slashed GST rates on many items, but chose to ignore the textile sector. The weavers and the traders have been lobbying hard with the Centre since many months for relief and simplification of the GST law, but in vain. 
 
 Many in the textile sector feel the Centre may have showered its blessings of GST relief on the diamond sector to reciprocate its thanks for the astounding victory of   candidates in all the four assembly constituencies of Surat, which fell under Patidar-dominated areas.
