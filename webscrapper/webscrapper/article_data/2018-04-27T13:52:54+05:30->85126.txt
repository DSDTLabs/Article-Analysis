MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday directed the Theni superintendent of police (SP) to consider a plea seeking police permission and protection for holding a protest against India-based neutrino observatory in Theni district and pass appropriate orders on April 27. It then adjourned the case to April 28. 

 The division bench of justices C T   and A M Basheer Ahamed gave this direction on a petition filed by R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran’s supporter Thanga Tamil Selvan. 
 
 During arguments, the government opposed the plea. The petitioner’s side had said that Dhinakaran’s   (AMMK) decided to hold an agitation at   in Theni on May 6 to support the public voice against the installation of the neutrino observatory. For that, the petitioner gave a representation to the police to hold a public meeting. It is apprehended that police would reject the plea by stating the same reasons they had mentioned earlier. 
 
 On April 12, when the petitioner had sent a representation to the Bodi taluk police inspector and the Theni SP seeking permission to hold an agitation on May 4, the SP rejected it on April 14 saying that the agitation is unwarranted because the TNPCB (Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board) and the forest department did not grant any permission for the project. 
 
 But, the central government allowed the research unit to use 3.4 lakh litre of water from the Periyar dam. It shows the government is keen on commencing work on a war-footing. Besides, several political parties, organisations and public have been opposing the neutrino project by conducting protests, meetings and rallies, for whom the police had given permission. But, police denied permission for the petitioner only. Hence, it was necessary to direct the police to give nod for the event, scheduled on May 6.
