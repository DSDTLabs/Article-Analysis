THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Last week,   were full of forwards thanking   for making women ditch serials for news channels. Forget the sexism, the latest TV viewership data from the Broadcast Audience Research Council India (BARC) shows that a large share of viewers of entertainment channels switched to news channels last week following Dileep's arrest.

 Arguably for the first time, a news channel ­ Asianet News has climbed up the ladder occupied by prominent entertainment channels to grab the third position among all Malayalam channels ­ after Asianet and Surya TV . While all news channels gained considerably , general entertainment channels (GEC) in Malayalam showed a proportionate dip in viewership too, underlining the theory that viewers of GEC migrated to news in flocks to follow the latest in Dileep case.
 
 
  
 
 For example, on the week 25 (June 17 to June 23), the impressions (Impressions means number of target audience in thousands) for Asianet News was 34,991. However, in the week 28 (July 8-July 14), the number rose to 75,726, a growth of 216% of viewership.
 
 In week 25, entertainment channel Asianet had 2,54,599 impressions, while it reduced to 2,42,735 in week 28. This was 84,008 and 81,775 respectively for week 25 and 28 for Surya TV , which is in the second position.
 
 Manorama News, which is in the seventh position, improved impressions from 20,140 in week 25 to 44,177 in week 28, a growth of 219%. Mathrubhumi News, which is in the 9th position in the list of Malayalam channels, improved its viewership from 18,453 in week 25 to 40,109 by week 28, a growth of 217%. Editor of Asianet News M G Radhakrishnan said it was the cocktail of celebrity and crime that fuelled the unprecedented growth in viewership. However, he said that it was trivial to compare the trend with serials or sensationalism. “This was not just another crime. This was a big news, as it not only exposed the alleged involvement of a top celebrity but also opened up debates about film industry , safety of women and lot more,“ he said. Radhakrishnan recalled a similar situation when results in 2016 assembly elections were announced. “ At that time, Asianet News even beat all GEC channels in Gulf countries“, he said.
 
 Media observer and former MP   opined it as a temporary phenomenon. “It is not that people switched to news channels. The additional viewers who switched from entertainment to news actually sought entertainment. This can never be seen as a trend,“ he said. Paul said news channels were utilizing the entertainment part of the case.“Whenever I mention about the legal aspects or the human rights issue of the accused, the anchors will change the topic.Also, whenever channels took up other topics, people changed channels,“ he said.
