VISAKHAPATNAM: Despite the   ban on cockfights, the ‘blood sport’ continued unabated in three out of four north coastal   districts with lakhs of rupees wagered on them.

 The police in these four districts filed a total of 965 cases against people who organised cockfights under the AP Gaming Act, 1974, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1986 and other relevant sections. Out of the 965 cases, 520 have been registered against gamblers.
 
 Even in   city, police registered six cases after raiding areas such as Arilova, Pendurthy and Gajuwaka.
 
 The highest number of cases against organisers of cockfights has been registered in East Godavari. The East Godavari police registered a total of 326 cockfight cases and arrested 1,141 people who participated and organised cockfights.
 
 Kakinada-based animal rescue organisation founder secretary Gopal R   rued that people disobeyed court orders putting a ban on cockfights. He alleged that the claim made by police that they did their job on Sankranti is an ‘eyewash’.
 
 “As cockfight is a traditional game, nobody could stop it and people went ahead with it with the indirect support from the government. The section 144 also did not yield any results,” Surabattula said.
