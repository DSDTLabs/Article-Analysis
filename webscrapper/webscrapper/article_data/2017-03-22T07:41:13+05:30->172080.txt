BENGALURU: An increasing number of cops in the state is suffering from diabetes and hypertension. Long duty hours, irregular sleep and untimely meals have taken a toll on their health.

 Replying to a query by police officerturned-politician P   (BSR) in the on Tuesday, home minister G   said a recent health check showed that 4,506 policemen suffer from hypertension and 3,712 from diabetes. And a whopping 7,050 cops are suffering from both the health conditions, he added.
 
 The data concerns cops above 40 years of age, and includes personnel from the level of constables to DySPs (other than IPS officers).
 
 The minister said the government has introduced yearly medical tests for policemen and is spending Rs 1,000 on t each of them. “They have been told to make sure their higher-ups grant them a day off every week, and consider their health status before posting them for heavy bandobust and other hectic du ies,“ he added.
 
 As to why hypertension and diabetes are so rampant, Parameshwara said high stress levels and nature of work could be the reasons. “Though in some cases diabetes may be hereditary, in others it's because of lifestyle. Cops don't have a proper diet and do not eat at regular intervals,“ said an police officer. “More than 60% of health problems today are man-made and related to poor lifestyle. These stem from obesity, tobacco and alcohol addiction, eating the wrong kind of food, inactivity, etc. We have been making efforts to educate policemen in making lifestyle changes so as to reduce stress levels,“ he said.
 
 “They are even referred to counsellors and psychiatrists and encouraged to take up yoga and sports if needed, so that the cause of stress could be identified and addressed,“   said in his written reply.
