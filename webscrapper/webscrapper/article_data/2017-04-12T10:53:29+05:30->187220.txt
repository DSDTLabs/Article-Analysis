AHMEDABAD: A woman from   first got her husband put behind bars, but later moved   high court in desperation to get him released.

 Last week,   and   quarrelled over a domestic issue. Fearing her husband’s aggression, Anju called the emergency police helpline. On the cops’ arrival, she complained about her husband’s ill-treatment and ensured that he was detained.
 
 Sola police took   into custody and held him to avoid a further breach of peace. This happened on April 6. When Darji did not return after a few hours, Anju went to a lawyer who she works for as a domestic help. They went to Sola police station and requested the cops to let them to talk to Darji. They were not allowed to do so.
 
 Offended at the refusal and alleged high-handedness of the police, Anju moved the HC the next day, filing a habeas corpus petition. Her argument was that her husband was detained without a formal complaint, and she was not even allowed to meet the detenue. Police did not have the right to keep her husband in the lock-up without any reason. She prayed that ss this was illegal custody, the HC should direct the police to immediately free the man.
 
 Meanwhile, Sola police invoked section 151 of CrPC against Darji and detained him to prevent an offence. He was produced before an executive magistrate the next day and released on bail.
 
 On the other hand, the high court issued notice to Sola police in response to Anju’s habeas corpus petition and slated a further hearing for April 10. By the next hearing, Darji was already home. When the matter came up for hearing on Monday, the judges said, “Now that the husband of the petitioner is already released, we are not inquiring further into the cause of his detention.”
