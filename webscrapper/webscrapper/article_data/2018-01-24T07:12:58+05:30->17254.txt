LUCKNOW: The skirmish between   MP   Verma and a local legislator from the party over distribution of blankets and winter clothes, caught on camera, has turned ugly after the government withdrew all three gunmen as part of security detail to the  .

 Riled Maholi MLA Shashank Trivedi has described the action taken after the incident as a 'dirty caste' war.
 
 Though the incident took place on Lohri when the two BJP leaders had gathered to jointly distribute woollen clothes at Maholi tehsil office in Sitapur, Trivedi claims that the UP Police has now started an arms verification drive against his aides and supporters.
 
 “There are two issues that have saddened me. First is the withdrawal of the gunmen when it was the MP from my own party who is evidently seen in the video resorting to violence. Second, the verification of my supporters. When I rang up the Sitapur SP, he said it’s a routine process. The MP belongs to Kurmi community. Those who stay with me are either Brahmins or Thakurs,” Trivedi said.
 
 The Lohri video shows Verma removing one of her sandals and making repeated attempts to hit Trivedi's supporters.
 
 It also shows Verma slapping Trivedi's gunman  .
 
 Trivedi's gunmen were first suspended and have now been asked to report to Police Lines in Sitapur.
 
 Trivedi has now threatened to register an FIR on charges of physical threat and intimidation by the BJP MP. In UP, each MLA is entitled to two to four gunmen, depending on threat perception.
 
 Varma was summoned by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday after the video went viral.
 
 The police confirmed that they have been asked to restore the MLA’s gunmen but Trivedi said he has made it a prestige issue since it was his gunmen who were assaulted by the MP.
 
 “My gunmen's dignity needs to be restored, not just the gunmen. Why were they suspended? I would not take any other gunmen. I would only take the two whom my party's MP had thrashed in full public view,” said Trivedi.
