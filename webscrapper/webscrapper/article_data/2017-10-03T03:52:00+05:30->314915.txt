Ahmedabad: An   firm manager has registered a complaint against a distant relative of his with Navrangpura police for   of Rs 1.32 crore.

 According to Navrangpura police, Yogin Patel, 30, a resident of Randesan, is a manager with Patel Mahendrabhai Somabhai angadia firm. In 2016, he was approached by Harsh Patel, a resident of Nirnaynagar, Ghatlodia, who is Yogin’s distant relative from his native place. Harsh told him that he was involved in legal money transfers abroad and asked him to contact him if he had any customers with such a requirement.
 
 “According to Yogin’s complaint, one of his regular customers, Mitul Patel, had to send money to Singapore. Yogin asked Harsh whether he could take the job. Harsh agreed and in March claimed to have sent Rs32 lakh and in April Rs72 lakh to the bank account of Singapore-based Ava Technology. He also sent bank receipts for these,” said a police official.
 
 However, when Shah inquired with his associate in Singapore, he learned that no money had been transferred. Yogin approached Harsh over the transfer of Rs1.32 crore when Harsh claimed that the associate was lying and refused to communicate further. According to Yogin’s complaint, he also went to Harsh’s residence and came to know that Harsh had left for Dubai.
 
 Yogin has complained that Harsh refused to return the money and even threatened him.
