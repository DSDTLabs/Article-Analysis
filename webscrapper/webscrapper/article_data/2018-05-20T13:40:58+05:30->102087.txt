KERI: In Nagargao village panchayat, a tigress was recently captured on camera inside the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary. This proves once again, that Mhadei could be a favoured habitat for the big cats. 

 The camera traps were set up by forest officials in Goa after evidence proved the presence of tigers. 
 
 In 2013, a picture of a tigress was captured on the camera traps, after which the presence of the same tigress was repeatedly captured on camera for successive years. 
 
 Last year, camera traps captured images of five individual tigers. This year, after the   census, there was hope of securing photographic evidence of these five tigers. However, camera traps that were installed by forest officials were stolen for a second time, and it was not possible to get further evidence.
 
 Prakash Salelkar, the range forest officer (RFO) at the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary told STOI, “In the first week of May this year, the camera trap picked pictures of the tigress inside the wildlife sanctuary. Our guards and trekkers are constantly vigilant to nab culprits involved in stealing camera traps.” The forest department will be removing all the camera traps with the onset of the monsoon this year. 
 
 The wildlife sanctuary had been notified in 1999 as the forest department got repeated evidence of presence of tigers. Steps were taken for protection and conservation of the tiger habitat. However, more efforts are needed from the government to create a tiger reserve. 
 
 Amrut Singh, a wildlife enthusiast from Bicholim told STOI, “The government should act promptly on the proposal of a tiger reserve, which was approved by Goa state wildlife advisory board in 2017, by including core areas of Mhadei and Mahavir sanctuaries along with the Mollem national park.”
