KANNUR: BJP State president   has demanded that Kerala chief minister   should visit the houses of the   attacked and set ablaze allegedly by the CPM workers near Payyannur in the district in the last couple of days.

 After visiting the houses of the BJP workers and local leaders that were attacked following the CPM-BJP clashes in the suburbs of Payyannur, on Thursday, he also said the CPM is not going to have any upper hand by demolishing the houses of the rivals.
 
 “The attack on the houses of the leaders and workers of the BJP is a new trend and the CPM resorted to this after it was devastated ideologically,” said the BJP State president, who added that intolerance is behind these attacks.
 
 He said the attacks on the houses of the BJP activists and sympathizers were executed in a planned manner and all these attacks had the same nature and were executed in the same time. By destroying the household items and even the toilets, the aim of the hooligans was to make sure the houses are no longer livable, he said.
 
 The CPM started the attacks by claiming that there were bomb attacks against their activists; however, the police remained inactive when the violence was unleashed and even now cases have not been registered in many incidents, he said.
 
 The BJP delegation visited nearly twenty houses and shops of the BJP workers around Payyannur, as also the offices of the BJP and RSS that had come under attack.
