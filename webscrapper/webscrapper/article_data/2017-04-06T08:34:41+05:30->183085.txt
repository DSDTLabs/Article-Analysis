HYDERABAD: A remark by a   leader that the next government in   would be led by his party has provoked   MP   to react sharply. "You will have to face the storm," Kavitha said, reacting to a statement made by BJP spokesperson Krishna Saagar Rao. The BJP leader's confidence that 'it's a certainty,' Kavitha's response was firm and polite. "Please prepare well and brace yourself. You'll have to face a TRS storm. Jai Telangana!" 

 Kavitha shares a good rapport with BJP leaders, Union ministers and MPs. However, when the local BJP leader chose to prophecy about his party's victory, she gave a befitting response on social media. TRS supporters also jumped into action questioning how the BJP could imagine to form government in Telangana.
 
 "But where are the 'leaders' in Telangana worth a name?" someone asked. Saagar Rao responded saying, "This was the same question raised in Assam, Manipur, Haryana, Maharashtra and even UP. You will see the leaders when we get there." While attending to people's problems and issues, Kavitha also makes sure to respond to criticism on her micro-blogging site. "Why so pessimistic!? We meet 100s of people in need everyday and do our best to serve them. Social media is yet another way and not the only way," she responded to a post by a person, who said, "I agree that KTR and you are doing good. But it is a pity that common man believes in social media for help rather than traditional government procedures."
 
 In parliament and outside, Kavitha leaves no opportunity to criticise the BJP government at the Centre. On March 17, Kavitha inspected the damage to crop in Nandigam village of Bodhan in Nizamabad district and said the Centre's current crop insurance policy was inadequate. "It never came to the rescue of farmers in our country," she said and tweeted her comments to Prime Minister   also. She said it was time that a good crop insurance policy was in place.
