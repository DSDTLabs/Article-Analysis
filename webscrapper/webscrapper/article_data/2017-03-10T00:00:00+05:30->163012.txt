Portraying the exploits of an introverted youth, the film   has seven tracks put together by two newbie music composers. There is something that’s too familiar about many of the songs in the album and thus, it’s nothing groundbreaking.

 Haricharan sings the opening song Varminnal, which starts off poorly, but works up some charm as it progresses. The singer does invest in the song the right touch of passion and love. The mild classical touches given to the song makes it interesting while it lasts.
 
 The name attached to the second song Illamai, Shaktisree Gopalan, skyrockets the expectations about it, before it starts playing. However, unless backed by stunning visuals, the slow paced track wouldn’t offer much. The tune is simple, words of love are superbly delivered by the singer, but it hasn’t got the X factor to hold your attention for long. The puthiyoru vaanam section is charming, but that is if you don’t skip next before you reach that point. Anyway, it is the best song of the album.
 
 The third song Enthanu Mone by Anthony Dassan sounds like something that would enliven the proceedings on screen. To make sense of the madness over which it is featured, you need to listen to the track a few times, however.
 
 A slow track that sounds like a drunken repartee, Arun James’ Karirulu isn’t a regular song, but the novelty of it doesn’t translate to retaining the audience’s interest. Suchith Suresan and Charles Nazareth sings the next, Thaniye Thaniye, a fun song crooned by a hopeless heart. A decent one-time listen, the song, however, might not resonate well with all. A skip-worthy song Tarara, with some good beats and intro, by Yazin Nizar wraps up the soundtrack.
