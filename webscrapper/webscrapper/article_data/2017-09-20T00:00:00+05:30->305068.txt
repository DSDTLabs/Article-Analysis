Last week was a new beginning for students of St Teresa’s College, Kochi, as the members of the latest College Union inauguration took charge.
 The representatives made sure they looked their elegant best, dressed in pretty saris.   first launched the union’s motto Siddhir Bhavathi Karmaja, which means success is born out of action.
 
 There was a positive vibe in the campus, as the members vowed to bring forth pathbreaking initiatives, with their mates cheering them on.
 General Secretary Srishti K says she felt blessed to be chosen as one of the 13 elected representatives of the college. “It is a huge honour and at the same time an equally big responsibility. All the other Union members and I aim towards providing an enjoyable and fruitful year for our college mates and also strive to keep our college’s honour high in every regard,” she says.
 
 Chairperson Aleena says that she would like to put her best foot forward. “We would like to introduce a few events which would be useful for both the students and others. Reaching out to the maximum number of people through our programmes and events would also be our priority,” she says.
 
 When asked what more can students expect from them, she says that rather than building castles in the air, she prefers to let their actions do the talking.
