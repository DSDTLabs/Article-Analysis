BENGALURU: Leveraging Uttar Pradesh CM   Adityanath’s brand equity, the   is going all out to woo   voters in Karnataka. The party is peddling Yogi’s weekend meeting and overnight stay at Sri Adichunchunagiri Mutt, headed by Vokkaliga seer  , as a strategic alliance.

 In a couple of Kannada posts by the BJP,   and Nirmalananda Nath Swami are seen together with a message: “Yogi Adityanath on Saturday night stayed in Bengaluru, not at any five-star hotel but at the Adichunchunagiri Mutt, which belongs to the Nath sect.” The spiritual link is established.
 
 While the message intends to suggest that the fiery UP CM is austere in his outlook, political pundits look at it as one which intends to connect Yogi and the Adichunchunagiri mutt, the most revered and influential of Vokkaliga mutts, belonging to the same sect.
 
 Krishne Gowda, a sociologist from St Philomena’s College in Mysuru, said there is a spiritual connection between Adityanath and the Mutt, which may be “outwardly” projected by parties as having a deeper meaning. “It is true that for hundreds of years, the Nath sect has had a deep connection with the Adichunchunagiri Mutt. Adityanath and seer Nirmalananda Nath Swami do have a bond. Perhaps political parties are trying to project this to the Vokkaligas,” he said.
 
 Union minister and Bengaluru North MP D V Sadananda Gowda tweeted: “Yogi & Sri Nirmalananda swamy follow the same spiritual preaching hence Yogi has a close relationship with Vokkaliga community of Karnataka.”
 
 His statement resulted in a twitter war, with   working president Dinesh Gundu Rao asking the BJP and Sadananda Gowda to stop “insulting” the spiritual leaders of Karnataka. However, independent observers in the Mysuru belt consider the   connection as nothing more than “optics” being exploited. “In reality, it may be very hard to sway the traditional Vokkaliga belt towards the BJP,” said one observer.
