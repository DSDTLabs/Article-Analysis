BARWANI:   in the   has sparked   and led to a   to stop the glorification of a  . 

 Strangely, the administration not only stood aside for 10 years and watched the temple being built in violation of a court order, but also seems reluctant to act now.
 
  Although the administration has ordered a probe, Sendhwa SDO (revenue) B S Kalesh told TOI that little can be done. "The complaint was made when the construction of the temple was almost over and 'Pran Pratishtha' (of the idol) is about to take place on February 7. I am unable to stop it on the eve of Pran Pratishtha because it has become a matter of faith for thousands of people," he said, adding that the administration "has not given it legality and is waiting for the inquiry report". 
 
  To make matters tougher for the administration, minister Antar Singh Arya was seen at the head of the Pran Pratishtha celebrations on Tuesday. Asked if he doesn't consider Sati an illegal practice and a social evil, he was quick to say that he "strongly opposes it". Then why did he join the celebration? The minister said that he was actually going to inaugurate the Anand festival in Sendhwa municipality but "stopped to meet some dignitaries, including Sendhwa municipality president Basanti Bai Yadav". 
 
 "I have nothing to do with the procession. I don't even know that there is a complaint against the temple," he said.
