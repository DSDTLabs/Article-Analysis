NAGPUR: Mahindra Mutual fund is eyeing investors in small towns and villages for its two new mutual funds. The funds — Mahindra Bal Vikas Yojana for children, and  , an open ended equity scheme — have been launched from Nagpur.

 Nagpur was chosen for the formal launch as the asset management company ( ) is eyeing markets in similar centres rather than metros. It is expected that the Rs25 crore hoped to be collected through both the offers, starting from April 20, will come from around 150 centres. Normally investment from 10 to 12 centres is considered enough in the industry, said Ashutosh Bishnoi, the managing director of Mahindra Asset Managment Company Private Limited (MAMCPL).
 
 “The schemes were designed after an extensive survey of rural areas. It was found that the aspirational levels of the young have gone up, for which the families will need funds. They are dreaming out of the box too. For example, the team came across a case of a girl in Punjab who wanted to become a   judge. A boy in   wanted to become an international kabaddi champ. There were many who wanted to make careers in sports. The stories have been featured in the promotional ad too,” he said. 
 
 Bishnoi said the AMC has been extensively using social media to spread the message too. 
 
 The company feels that the market is highly priced at present. However, by the time the new fund offer (NFO) is over, it would be mid-May. From then, till mid-June, when the company will invest, it is expecting a correction in the market This will provide the right opportunity to invest for the Badhat Yojana which is an equity scheme, he said.
 
 In Bal Vikas Yojana, 65% will be in equity and rest in debt. On the debt products, it is hoped that the rates will firm up in the coming days. However, with the relaxation in rules, number of corporate bond launches are expected to go up on which the AMC is also banking he said.
