CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   on Monday opposed the central government move to merge Chandigarh police's   cadre with the police officers of all UTs, including that of Delhi. He termed the move as "mischievous and provocative" and urged Punjab chief minister to ensure that no one was allowed to tamper with the status of Chandigarh as the designated capital of Punjab. 

  Sukhbir also asked the chief minister to ensure that the directives of former Union home minister P Chidambram were fully implemented with regard to the division of employees between Punjab and Haryana on 60:40 basis till Chandigarh's actual transfer to Punjab. The SAD president added that, "The UT administration is not following this ratio in appointment of DSPs, teachers or other employees." 
 
  He added that during his tenure as chief minister   had aggressively pursued the matter with the central government, forcing the Union home minister to issue a fresh directive on Punjab's plea.
