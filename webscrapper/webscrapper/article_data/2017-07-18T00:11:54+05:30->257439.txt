Trichy: Commemorating second death anniversary of the former President APJ Abdul Kalam, a   has been taken out to his memorial at Rameswaram. 

 People from different walks of life which included two retired sub inspectors and college students started their run from Major Saravanan memorial roundabout near St John's vestry school on Monday morning. 
 
 Holding a torch in the memory of the former president, the the group of 15 has planned to reach Rameswaram on Friday. They have planned to cover a distance of at least 50 km per day. 
 
 Dividing them into three teams, the members will run in shifts by taking rest in a vehicle that would follow the team members. 
 
 “We are not attempting any record of sorts as it is the first ever attempt as a team,” says Mubeen Ahmed, 29, who is running a courier office in Thiruverumbur. “By attempting such a run, we want to attract the attention of people in the country towards the visionary Abdul Kalam and the messages he has left behind, especially for the youth,” he said. 
 
 “Raising trees and planting as many saplings to counter global warming was the mantra that Kalam gave the country. While there has been good awareness on it, we want to further spread the message though this run and pay our homage to the departed visionary,” said Arockiasamy, a retired sub inspector of police. 
 
 The team will hand over the torch to relatives of Kalam and end their run at his memorial.
