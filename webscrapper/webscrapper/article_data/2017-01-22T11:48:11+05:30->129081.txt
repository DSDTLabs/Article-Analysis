PUNE: The head of an NGO has been arrested for allegedly murdering a woman 10 years ago. The alleged murder came to light while the police were  .

 A crime branch team arrested the suspect   (35), a resident of Mhalunge, on Tuesday. The court has remanded Katore to police custody.
 
 A kidnapping case was registered against Katore in 2007 but investigations did not yield much. Deputy commissioner of police PR Patil said Katore allegedly killed his live-in partner Archana Sangale (30) following domestic disputes. “Sangale was a school teacher and was separated from her husband when she met Katore,” Patil said.
 
 Katore and Sangale started living together but did not marry since the divorce petition was before the court, Patil said. 
 
 They also bought an apartment in the city. However, trouble brewed and in November 2006, Sangale disappeared after telling her parents that Katore was taking her to Kolhapur to offer prayers, Patil said.
 
 At first, a missing persons’ complaint was registered with the Chatushrungi police and Sangale’s father lodged a kidnapping case against Katore in 2007. The police arrested Katore but no headway was made.
 
 In 2012, a fake document was prepared to sell the apartment co-owned by Sangale and Katore. The forgery came to light earlier this month and a case was registered with the Khadki police station. 
 
 During the probe, the police realized that Katore had killed Sangale. He and his accomplice allegedly strangled Sangale and dumped her body at Islampur in Sangli in November 2006, senior inspector Milind Gaikwad said.
 
 “We have matched the description of the victim and the body found at Islampur and both have striking similarities,” he added. Sangli police will investigate the case further.
