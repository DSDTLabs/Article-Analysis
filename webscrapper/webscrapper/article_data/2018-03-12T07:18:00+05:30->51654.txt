GHAZIABAD: A 28-year-old man, a resident of Vivekanand Nagar, along with his two brothers has been accused of disposing of the body of his wife in a canal, who had allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling two days back. 

 The man and his two brothers are absconding now.
 
 The matter came to light on Sunday after a passerby heard some arguments going on between members of the two families and called police control room.
 
 The   has been identified as Shailu (25), a resident of Raya in Mathura district. Five years ago, Shailu married Guddu, a resident of Tappal in Aligarh, who runs a dhaba-cum-sweet shop in   area. They had a three-year-old son. Incidentally, two elder sisters of Shailu, Seema and Santosh, got married to Guddu’s brothers Kripal and Bacchu Singh respectively. All of them lived in same two-storied house in Vivekanand Nagar.
 
 According to Seema, on March 9, Guddu and Shailu had a fight over some issue during which the former had even slapped her. “In evening, Shailu had locked herself in the storeroom situated on the terrace of the house. Even after one-and-a-half hour, when she did not come out of the storeroom, the door was broken and she was found to be hanging from the ceiling.”
 
 Seema added, “Shailu’s body was taken down and kept in house and on the next day the men of the house took away the body and disposed it of in a canal.”
 
 Shailu’s brothers Rajesh Singh and Laxman Singh, were informed about the death, who reached the house on Sunday.
 
 SHO, Kavi Nagar, Samarjeet Singh said, “We’re trying to trace the body. It’s not clear whether the men disposed of the body or cremated it. No complaint has been received so far.”
