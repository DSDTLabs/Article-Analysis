“The first phase will see the   and café open in June. All the installations in the Sound Garden are nearly complete. We should open that to the public latest by June 25. The interiors of the museum will be ready in a few months, with different experience zones, which will allow all audiophiles to experience music and also look at the varied memorabilia we have on display at the museum,” says Dr Suma. 
 Among the many music memorabilia on display will be late Ustad Bismillah Khan’s shehnai and Sudha Raghunathan’s tambura. They also have late Pandit Bhimsen Joshi’s shawl, a pan box and waistcoat. These memorabilia will be part of the instruments gallery, which will house around 250 Indian instruments. The museum will also have thematic galleries that will explore the multi-dimensional narrative of Indian music. These will focus on themes such as diversity, international influences, history of recording and many other themes, aiming to give a holistic experience to the visitors.
