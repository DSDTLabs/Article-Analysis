GURUGRAM: Fresh investigations have revealed that the kingpin of the fake arms licence scam, Manish Bhardwaj alias Kala, and the other main accused, inspector Jasmer Singh, had sold a fake weapon for Rs 5 lakh to a commandant of Central Reserve Police Force ( ) in Kadarpur.

 This was unearthed on Thursday, when the commandant approached the   probing the case and lodged a complaint. The SIT seized the revolver, bought for private use, and verified the commandant’s arms licence. It may be noted that two troopers who were deployed at the CRPF shooting rage in Kadarpur, are also under the scanner in the scam.
 
 An investigating officer of the SIT said the commandant visited the SIT office and told them he had bought a Taurus revolver, ‘made in Brazil’, for Rs 5 lakh from Manish Bhardwaj and Jasmer Singh, at the   Gun House, which is registered in the name of inspector Jasmer Singh’s father. 
 
 “We suspected the weapon was fake, but were wary as it was enrolled in the name of a CRPF commandant. It seems Bhardwaj and Jasmer had bought an old Brazil-made weapon from a gun house, got it copied in Khurja- and Bulandshahr-based illegal arms factories, and sold the fake to the CRPF commandant,” the investigating officer added.
 
 “We’ve seized the fake ‘Brazil-make’ revolver. It will be sent to the forensic science laboratory in Madhuban for examination. We’ve recorded the CRPF commandant’s statement and are verifying his arms licence. The two suspect CRPF jawans are yet to be identified, but action will be taken as per law,” said ACP Anil Yadav, head of SIT.
