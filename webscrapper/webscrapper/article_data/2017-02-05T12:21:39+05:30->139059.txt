AHMEDABAD: Irony played out loud and clear when a couple was brutally mowed down while sleeping on a footpath just below the homes for the poor built by  . 

  An injured member of the Marwadi family said that they were surveyed thrice for allocation of a house before the accident killed their two members and left at least four hospitalised. 
 
 Malabhai Marwadi, who lost his brother Bhagabhai Marwadi and sister-in-law Lakshmi in the accident on Friday night, said, “Some madam, who said that she is from government, came and took our names for house allocation. She told us that we will be given houses in Shastrinagar  . But that never happened.” 
 
 Malabhai, who had suffered a paralytic stroke two years ago, sells balloons to run a family of five members. Malabhai along with his wife Laliben, aged around 30, and a one-and-a-half-years old daughter Sangita have been hospitalized at the Civil Hospital after the accident.
 
 Malabhai has sustained injuries in ribs and coughs out blood when he talks. His wife has got injuries in head, shoulder and lower abdominal parts while their daughter sustained fracture in both the hands.
 
 “I run my family’s livelihood by selling balloons and my wife used to work at a roadside eatery. We could earn Rs3,000 a month but the earning was not enough to stay in a safe shelter,” Malabhai said while wiping away the blood from his mouth that came out as he was talking. 
 
 The poor man said that it would be a blessing for them if the state government gives the poor families like them a house that they need the most.
