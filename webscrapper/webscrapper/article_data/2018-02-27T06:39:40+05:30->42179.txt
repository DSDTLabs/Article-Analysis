CHENNAI: Global luxury auto major   is beginning to view India as a “lost opportunity country”, still lagging far behind China in terms of growth and market expansion. According to   MD & CEO  , the brand’s German headquarters sees India as a market with opportunities but disrupted by local taxation and other policies. And even the good growth rate that the Indian luxury car segment clocked in 2017 was on the back of a “terrible 2016 and a very low base”.

 “If you compare India and China, for every car sold in India, China sells seven. And in luxury cars, for every car sold in India, China sells 53! There are a lot of opportunities in India but in last four-five years, we’ve not seen growth getting closer to China and India is still significantly behind. That’s also the way Germany looks at it and we hope India can make it into the top 20 markets for Mercedes-Benz. But the question is when and what are the other disruptive elements that the government will come up with. Every time we get some growth, we are taxed higher which dampens sentiment,” said Folger.
 
 “From our perspective, India is still, I wouldn’t call it hardly a disappointment, but what we still call it is lost opportunity — a country of lost opportunities,” says the Mercedes-Benz CEO.
 
 Mercedes-Benz is focusing on getting incremental growth from tier-2 and -3 cities, which currently form 30-40% of its sales. “Our growth depends on moving into tier 2-3 cities, but it works both ways — you need volume growth in order for our dealers to invest in expanding infrastructure,” said Folger. “We’ve been experimenting with smaller satellite formats, meaning the dealership size is more compact with more emphasis on after service with, may be, two-three cars for display. Growth in two-three cities has doubled in last three years as we’ve doubled our outlets as well, though it’s on the back of a lower base,” he added.
