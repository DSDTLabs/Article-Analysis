 of   in Karnataka today flayed actor   for his alleged insulting remarks on 'Mahabharat' and demanded an apology from him. "It is unbecoming of   Kamal Haasan to hurt the sentiments of any religious community, including Christians and Muslims. He has been in the thick of controversies even in the past, and we demand he should apologise," Parvananda Swami said. 

  
  
 In an interview, the actor while responding to a question about violence against women, particularly in the film industry, had said in this country, people read even books like the epic Mahabharat, wherein 'even a woman was pledged in gamble, as a bet,' an apparent reference to Paanchali.
  
 Pranavananda Swami said the actor had always been in news for "hurting" the sentiments of religious communities and threatened to take   action if he did not apologise for the controversial remarks. "He should apologise in next three days, or else he must face legal action," he said. A complaint has been filed against Kamal Hassan in a court in Tirunelveli District of   by Hindu Makkal Katchi over his remarks about Mahabharatha.
