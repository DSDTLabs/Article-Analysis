COIMBATORE: Thanks to last week’s heavy rainfall,   river has been steadily rising. Water has reached till Alandurai and after a few more showers, it will flow into the city and reach the lakes.

 As the river comes to life, environmental activists are calling for a concerted effort from the district administration to desilt the lakes, canals and also remove encroachments along the water bodies. “For water to reach the lakes, the canals need to be cleaned and de-silted. Encroachments should be removed. We have been cleaning various city lakes, but it is the public works department that has to use machinery and clean the canals. Water will reach the lakes only if the canals are maintained,” R Manikandan of   said.
 
 There are nearly 200 encroachments along water bodies on the Palakkad-Pollachi Road, Manikandan said. “Though 1,400 houses were recently removed, 200 houses are blocking the canal. Water from Noyyal will reach Vellalore tank only if those houses are removed,” he told TOI.
 
 Encroachments are also rampant near Ukkadam canal and Pudhukulam. “Sluice gates needs to be checked and the water bodies should be prepared for monsoon. Whenever we approached the PWD department, they blame it on lack of funds to carry out the work,” said Manikandan.
 
 According to officials, seven lakes in the city have filled up and in a few more weeks, all the lakes may reach full capacity. “The Kuniyamuthur channel alone takes water to four lakes — Sottaiyandu Kuttai, Ganganarayanasamudram, Perur Periyakkulam and Sengulam. More than the lakes, the canals and channels need to be cleared and de-silted,” said  , an activist.
