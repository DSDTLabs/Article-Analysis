LUCKNOW: A large number of   loyalists were on the stage in support of CM   in his successful take-over of the   during its convention on Sunday. They are being seen as turncoats, who owed their place in politics to Mulayam’s munificence. Each one of the SP topdogs at the convention owed his place in politics to Mulayam. 

 Among them, the most surprising ‘betrayer’ was party vice-president  , who also played a key role in the coup. A Rajya Sabha MP, who was among SP’s founder members personally selected by Mulayam in 1992, Nanda presided over the convention in which Akhilesh was anointed as SP boss. Taken aback by his betrayal, Mulayam expelled him from the party. Responding to this, Nanda said he has backed Akhilesh who is the future of the party. “Akhilesh will lead the party to victory and will become the next CM,” Nanda said, dismissing his expulsion as meaningless. “Now Akhilesh is the party chief,” he said. 
 
 Another old Mulayam associate Reoti Raman Singh, a minister in his cabinet in 2003 who went to the Lok Sabha from Allahabad on SP ticket in 2004 and 2009, too came out in support of Akhilesh. Later, his son Ujjwal Raman Singh, a minister during Mulayam’s last stint as CM, was accommodated as a minister of state in the Akhilesh dispensation. 
 
 Perhaps SP’s most vocal face in the Rajya Sabha,  , whose son Nitin Agarwal is a minister in the Akhilesh cabinet, figures in the list of candidates for the 2017 polls announced by both the Mulayam and Akhilesh camps from Hardoi sadar. Following reports of his sacking by Mulayam, Agarwal said, “As UP chief minister, Akhilesh has already emerged as the most promising party face.” 
 
 Senior minister in UP cabinet Rajendra Chaudhary, always seen by Mulayam’s side, went with Akhilesh soon after he was sworn in as CM in 2012. One of Mulayam’s trusted lieutenants, SRS Yadav, too deserted his political master and went with Akhilesh.
