AMRITSAR: The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) celebrated the festival of Mahashivratri at Katasraj cluster of temples in Pakistan without the Indian Hindu pilgrims who were forced to cancel their tour for want of permission by both the Indian and Pakistani governments.

 Speaking to TOI over the phone from Katasraj on Tuesday, ETPB deputy secretary, shrines,   said following the appeal of board’s new chairman Mohammad Aftab, over a hundred Hindus living near Katasraj cluster of temples and Lahore had converged at Katasraj to celebrate the festival.
 
 “We didn’t let the tradition break as the Hindus performed all the religious rituals with the help of a local pandit,” he said, adding that the new chairperson had participated in the prayers.
 
 Kendriya Sanatan Dharam Sabha (North India) chief Shiv Partap Bajaj said the Hindu jatha visit was canceled due to the noncommittal attitude of both the Indian and the Pakistani governments.
 
 Faraz said after cancellation of the Indian Hindu group’s visit, Aftab held a meeting and decided to extend invitation to Hindus living in Chakwal, Lahore, Nankana Sahib and other places to converge in large number at Chakwal for the celebrations of Mahashivratri. He said local Hindus had also held a meeting at Sri Krishna Mandir on Monday to reach Chakwal to celebrate Mahashivratri.
 
 Lahore temple priest   said, “We are disappointed over cancellation of Hindu jatha from India but with the help of the ETPB we were able to continue with the tradition.” He expressed regret that as per scheduled programme, they couldn’t install idols of Hindu deities in Katsraj temples as these idols were to be brought by the Indian
