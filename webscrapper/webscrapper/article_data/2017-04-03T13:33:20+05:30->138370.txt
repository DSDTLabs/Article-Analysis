NEW DELHI: The   on Friday sought the Gujarat government’s response to a petition filed by  , challenging the state’s decision to grant three months extension as  , who is an accused in the  .

 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud issued notice to the state government after Ribeiro’s counsel Kapil Sibal said Pandey was an accused in the Ishrat fake encounter case. “A police officer, who is on bail in a murder case, getting extension as head of the police force in a state sends a wrong signal,” he said.
 
 When Sibal argued for a stay on the extension granted to Pandey, the bench refused and said, “In this case, issuance of notice will serve the purpose. Things will sort out before the next date of hearing.” What the court probably meant was by the time the court takes up the case for hearing, the extension period will be over.
 
 Ribeiro challenged the Gujarat high court’s decision of August last year to dismiss his petition challenging the appointment of Pandey as in charge-DGP of the state.
 
 Pandey was arrested in the Ishrat Jahan case in August 13, 2013. He was granted bail after nearly two years in February 6, 2015. He was reinstated in service on February 9, 2015. Last year, he was made DGP.
