INDORE: The new rail line between Indore and Tihi is likely to be made operational for goods train soon. Officials with   of the   said, “The first container train is likely to start on this line from February.”

 They said this new line will pave way for operations of goods and container trains that will provide direct connectivity to industries in Pithampur. It is expected to reduce the distance between Mumbai and Indore by 200 km. This is another reason why Pithampur’s industries are eagerly awaiting this new line. The direct delivery of containers would save on travel time.
 
 Due to the lack of connectivity at present, goods are being transported to Ratlam by road and then to other destinations via train. Poor connectivity from Pithampur has always been an obstacle for freight exporters of this area. On an average, 280 containers are transported to Ratlam everyday by truck. Industries would save a huge amount of revenue with the rail connectivity.
 
 “The railways is also developing a depot around 500 metres away from   to load and unload goods & containers,” they said.
 
 Recently a train carrying 90 export containers was flagged off by the railways and   (CONCOR). The train was dispatched by CONCOR from Pithampur to check the viability of the track.
 
 Once the new 22-km long rail line is commissioned, CONCOR will dispatch containers from Pithampur only.
 
 At present, the railways is developing platforms and sheds for trains. An approach road is also being developed to provide accessibility to carrier vehicles, officials said.
