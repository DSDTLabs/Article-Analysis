NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked   and   to explain why 100% weightage is given to viva-voce exams for admissions to the university’s research courses.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice C   wondered if a university can have interviews only as criteria for admission.
 
 “At higher levels, how can you have 100% interviews? We doubt if any law allows that,” the bench observed, asking UGC to clarify.
 
 The court also sought to know what kind of teacher to student ratio exists in Delhi University, IITs and also top universities abroad in comparison to JNU.
 
 It was hearing a plea challenging the UGC notification that put a cap on number of MPhil and PhD research scholars a professor can guide.
 
 The plea filed by the Students’ Federation of India (SFI) and some aspiring MPhil and PhD students of JNU and DU has challenged the constitutional validity of the UGC (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of MPhil and PhD degree) Regulations 2016 which came into effect from July 5, 2016.
 
 They have contended that the UGC notification “threatens to put their future in jeopardy” as they would not be able to find research supervisors/guides due to the said notification.
