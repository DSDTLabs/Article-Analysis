JAIPUR: Playing safe, the effigy makers of demon king Ravana have made some changes in the design of the effigies. They have fixed a bamboo umbrella on the head of the effigies, to protect them from rain. Not only that, they have increased the prices of effigies upto 40% as the raw material used to make adhesive and bamboo got costlier following the introduction of GST.

 TOI on Tuesday visited various Ramleela committee grounds and streets where effigy makers are working hard to give final tou ches to their effigies.
 
 “In last two years, rainfall played spoilsport on Dussehra festival. Last year, at least 20 pieces of smaller effigies remained unsold due to the sudden rainfall on the eve of Dussehra. Thus, we have created an umbrella on the head of the effigy,“ said an effigy maker at Aadarsh Nagar Ramleela gro und. Ramleela committees have also been asked to arrange for bigger tents to ensure the effigies do not get damaged before they are set on fire.
 
 Apart from the fear of rain, rise in prices of material like bamboo sticks, adhesive for effigies has also affected the effigy makers.
 
 “Earlier, we used to get a Kaudi (20 pieces) of bamboo sticks in Rs 700, which has now increased to Rs 1,000.Likewise, the price of raw materials used for making adhesive has also increased.However, due to a slowdown in every business the sale of effigies is not as per our expectations,“ said  , an effigy maker who comes from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh to Jaipur.
 
 In order to compensate their losses, many effigy makers apart from supplying the effigies to various Ramleela committees, have also started making smaller effigies.
 
 “These are low-priced effigies which we are selling at Rs 250 to Rs 500 per unit. Many kids with their parents are coming to buy them for celebrating Dussehra in their localities and colonies,“ said Ramkishan, an effigy maker from Kothputli, while giving final touches to effigies in Jhotwara locality.
