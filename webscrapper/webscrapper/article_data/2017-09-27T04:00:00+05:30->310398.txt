Vadodara: After garba revellers enjoy their dance for hours, they get tired, but there is one community in Sanskarinagri which does not get tired as they perform sitting garba.

 Members of Naagar community, who migrated to city many years ago from Junagadh, have not done away with their centuries old tradition of performing sitting garba. “To whichever cities people of Naagar community migrated, they continued the practice of sitting garba where only songs of goddess Amba are sung,” said Nimil Baxi, a businessman from the community who plays ‘dholak’ throughout Navratri.
 
 The sitting garbas are not limited to singing but the participants also clap in the rhythm. “Unlike the normal garbas where the focus is more on music and beats, the garbas that we perform are more about lyrics,” added Baxi, who has been participating since past 26 years. The community members perform this unique garba at the house of one of the members.
 
 Baxi said that not only adults and seniors citizens participate in the garba but kids too sing enthusiastically. “Parents bring their children whose age is less than 10 years so that they can learn the tradition at a young age and continue the tradition,” he said. However, the attraction of big venues have not left young generation of the community as well.
 
 “The new generation does go at big venues which we cannot stop, but once in a while they do come and participate in the sitting garba,” added Baxi. Interestingly, the training of performing at the sitting garbas from young age have resulted in many of Naagar community members singing at big venues in the city.
