Udhagamandalam: The pleas of NGOs and environmentalists to shift the venue of the   in the   may have been in vain, but the organisers had to heed nature and change the proposed venue from Ooty  .

 Heavy downpour, which lashed the hills in the last one week, has turned the Race Course into a slushy ground. The forecast is also not favouring the organisers.
 
 On Friday, a bunch of AIADMK MPs and Nilgiris district AIADMK functionaries conducted a pooja at the Ooty Government Arts College ground for conducting the event. 
 
 The venue has been changed to the ground, for which permission has been obtained, a senior AIADMK functionary said. “Also, the date of the main function has been postponed to October 9 as we need time to prepare the ground for the huge audience,” he told TOI.
 
 This is the second time the date is being postponed for the centenary celebration. Earlier, the main function of the centenary celebration was scheduled on September 11 and due to administrative reasons (general council meeting on Sep 12), it was postponed to September 26. 
 
 Conducting the centenary celebrations on the ecologically-sensitive Race Course had drawn the attention of many environmentalists and NGOs. In a letter to the Nilgiris collector, the Nilgiris Environment and Cultural Service Trust said the Race Course in the heart of Ooty town is a place of environmental importance.
