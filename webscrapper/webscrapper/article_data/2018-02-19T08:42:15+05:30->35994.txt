PUNE: A special court for Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act has convicted and sentenced a 37-year-old physical training teacher of a school to three years rigorous imprisonment for sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl student, who was part of the school’s football team. 

 Special judge DG Murumkar found the convict,  , guilty of offences punishable under section 354-A (i) of the Indian Penal Code and section 7 of the POCSO Act. The court sentenced   to three years in   for each of the offences besides sentencing him to six months rigorous imprisonment for criminal intimidation and imposed a cumulative fine of Rs5,000. 
 
 Shaikh had taken a defence of total denial, claiming that he was falsely implicated. Among other things, he contended that the girl never raised an alarm nor did she disclose the incident immediately. There was an inordinate delay in registration of FIR against him while the FIR itself carried a wrong date of incident, which was later rectified. He argued that the girl could not have erred on the date of incident and that, there were discrepancies in the evidence recorded. 
 
 Additional public prosecutor   had examined five witnesses in support of the prosecution’s case.
 
 The court, however, relied on the steady and reliable evidence recorded by the prosecution witnesses and held that considering that circumstances through which the survivor had to go through and the impact of the incident, the delay in the registration of FIR was not fatal to the prosecution’s case. “The conduct of (survivor) remaining silent without shouting and without disclosing the incident to others would not cast a cloud of doubt on her evidence regarding the incident,” the court said.
