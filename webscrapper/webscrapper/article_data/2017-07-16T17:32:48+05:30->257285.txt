Actress   has revealed that she almost said no to her role in the 'Alien' movie. 

 The 67-year-old actress said she was hesitant about starring in the 1979 fantasy thriller, in which she portrays Ellen Ripley, because she thought it was a 'bleak script'.
 
  
  
 
 "It was a very, very bleak script," she said. The star was even more disappointed that she has graduated from Yale School of Drama to be cast in the franchise. "I survived drama school to do this?" she said. 
 
 It was not until Weaver spoke to director   that she had a change of heart, and realised the movie was going to be completely different to what she had initially thought. 
 
 "It wasn't till I met Ridley Scott and saw these amazing drawings by (Alien concept artistes)   and   of the alien itself that I thought, 'Oh. Well. I've never seen anything like this.'"
