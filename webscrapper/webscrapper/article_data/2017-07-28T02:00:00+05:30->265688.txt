PATNA: With CM Nitish Kumar and his JD(U) saying goodbye to the Grand Alliance on Wednesday, the   seems to be the real loser as the party had tasted power in the state after a decade.

 CP Joshi, in-charge of Congress in Bihar, met all the party’s 27 MLAs at the residence of Madan Mohan Jha on Thursday. Sources said Joshi reached here to chalk out the Congress strategy in the assembly on Friday.
 
 Almost all state Congress leaders had praised Nitish till he quit the Grand Alliance and joined NDA. On Thursday, Nitish was on target of even Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who called him a betrayer of public faith.
 
 Bihar Congress chief and now former minister in Nitish cabinet, Ashok Choudhary said the RJD, Congress and JD(U) had jointly fought an electoral war against communalism and won the bitter battle. “We had made Nitish our leader in the war, but he has joined hands with the enemy,” said Choudhary.
 
 Congress spokesperson Harkhu Jha said Nitish’s took a calculated move. “People voted for the Mahagatbandhan in 2015 on secular lines, but Nitish betrayed everyone. Instead of taking such a big step in a hurry, he should have waited for the Congress high command to sort out the problem,” he said.
 
 Jha also said Tejashwi Yadav’s resignation was an excuse. “As CM, Nitish had the power to dismiss Tejashwi. Why he didn’t do that? He also knew about Lalu’s conviction in a fodder scam case before joining hands with him,” said Jha.
 
 One Congress leader accepted that their position would further weaken in the national politics after Nitish switching sides.
