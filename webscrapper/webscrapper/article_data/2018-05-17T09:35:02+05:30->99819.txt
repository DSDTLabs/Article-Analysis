VISAKHAPATNAM: Living on the edge has become a way of life for people living in the villages that are on the banks of the Godavari, particularly in   village of   district.

  owners operate their vessels like auto-rickshaws, as they pick up dozens of villagers and drop them off at various destinations. These boats do not fulfill the requirements of safety measures and they always take on passengers much above the limit, resulting in deadly mishaps.
 
 In 1992, a boat capsized near  , with around 50 people losing their lives. The boat was salvaged and repaired, and is now still in service. The present owner had changed the boatâ€™s name from   to Lakshmi Venkateswara and is using the boat to ferry passengers. 
 
 Another reason being cited as a factor for the mishap is a large number of cement bags loaded on to the boat. Apart from 50 cement bags and 10 rice bags, there were four motorcycles being transported on the boat. When the strong winds destabilised the boat, the overloaded boat was unable to stay upright and drowned. The windows were also closed during the heavy winds, which led to the boat toppling over. The passengers were stuck in the boat and drowned due to the lack of an emergency exit. The 22 people who swam ashore were on the deck when the boat overturned. Former Rampa Chodavaram MLA   said that the boat has met with the accident when it was coming back from   after boarding two persons who were waiting on Godavari bund. He observed that tribals have no option other than relying on a boat journey.
