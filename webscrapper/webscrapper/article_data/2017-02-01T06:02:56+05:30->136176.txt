KOLKATA: The   (ICG) evacuated an Iraqi merchant navy officer, who had suffered a cardiac arrest, from a Jordanian-flag ship, off Sagar Island on Tuesday. The chief officer of the ship was rushed to   in a   fast interceptor boat and shifted to a city hospital by ambulance.

 “The MV Al Hadbaa was anchored 40 nautical miles south of Sagar Island in the  . It could not enter the harbor due to draught restrictions. On Tuesday morning, the ship’s agent requested the ICG for assistance as chief officer Nihad Abdulridha Alwan had a cardiac arrest. The fast interceptor boat C-418 was deployed from the ICG district headquarters in Haldia with a medical team at 8.30am. The boat was successful in evacuating Alwan and returned to Haldia at 2.30pm. The chief officer was provided medical assistance on the boat,” said Commandant   of Coast Guard regional headquarters (NE) in Kolkata. 
 
 This is the sixth medical evacuation from sea by the Kolkata-based regional HQ of the ICG since January 1, 2016. What makes this evacuation significant is that it occurred on the eve of the Coast Guard’s 40th Raising Day and is in keeping with the force’s motto Vayam Raksham (We Protect).
 
 “I commend the action of the crew for their swift action that saved the life of the mariner at sea,” said K R Nautiyal, IG and commander, Coast Guard regional HQ (NE).
