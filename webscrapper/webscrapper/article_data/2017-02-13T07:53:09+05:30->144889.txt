DEHRADUN: Congress vice president   helmed a 90km-long roadshow in Haridwar on Sunday, covering almost all the 11 constituencies in the district, which has the highest number of seats in the state.

 Launching a scathing attack on rebels, calling them kachra (garbage) who the party expelled for corruption, Gandhi said, “PM   talks of eradicating corruption, so why did he induct these people?” Referring to Modi’s “raincoat” jibe at  , Rahul advised the PM to “take lessons on manners from the people of Uttarakhand, who are known for being soft spoken and well-mannered”.
 
 Accusing   of double standards on corruption, Gandhi questioned why the PM did not act against the “94% of black money” in Swiss banks or invested in property and gold. “Instead, he took route of demonetisation to harass common man.” In his speeches, Gandhi used the word “mitron”. “
  (friends, my name is Modi... I don’t like you having money in your pockets).”
