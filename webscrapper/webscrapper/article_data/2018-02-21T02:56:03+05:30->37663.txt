MUMBAI: In the wake of a case of   rigging on a Thane-Jogeshwar auto trip, experts on Tuesday suggested the use of   apps that mimic meters.

 “There are mobile apps for both autos and taxis which are tools to inform a commuter if the meter of the auto or   hired is tampered,” transport expert Ashok Datar said. 
 
 Chetan Temkar, founder of SmartShehar  , said the problem of fast meters had returned after a lull of a few years. 
 
 “In 2012, there was a series of cases registered by police and RTO against rigged meters in the suburbs,” he said. “It was then that I came up with a start-up for creating a free mobile app which could mimic an   meter.”
 
 In the Thane-Jogeshwari auto case, the Wadala RTO on Tuesday summoned the permit holder for questioning, but he did not turn up.
