PATNA: District magistrate   on Thursday announced that the best Durga idols and pandals in the city would be awarded by the administration. 

 A panel of judges, consisting of ADM-rank officers, has been formed for the purpose. The officials will visit the pandals on Friday. 
 
 Agarwal said the artists of top three idols and pandals will get an appreciation award in the form of a certificate and a memento. “We have laid down certain parameters on the basis of which the idols and pandals will be judged,” he said.
 
 Use of only natural material in the making of the idol, as mentioned in the holy scripts, will fetch extra marks. Also, the idol painted with only non-toxic natural dyes will get extra marks.
 
 “In case of pandals, the judges will look for creativity and social message more than the expenditure incurred on them,” the DM said and added the results would be announced after the festivities.
