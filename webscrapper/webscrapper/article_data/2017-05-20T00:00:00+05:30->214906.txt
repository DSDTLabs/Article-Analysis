 chanced upon this exclusive picture from the set of   3. The third part of the Dandupalya series is being shot simultaneously with its sequel, Dandupalya 2. A source from the sets says, “The sequels are bilinguals, currently being shot in   and Telugu. Since the story requires the same set of actors for both parts, the team decided to shoot both simultaneously.” 

 Director Srinivas Raju’s Dandupalya saw actress   play her first de-glam role that got her back into the limelight. This time around, actress   joins the team for the second and third part, in what can be described as her own first de-glam avatar. When contacted, Sanjjanaa informed us, “I play the role of   — a rather strong character. I cannot reveal much about the story, except that this role helps me evolve as an actor.”
