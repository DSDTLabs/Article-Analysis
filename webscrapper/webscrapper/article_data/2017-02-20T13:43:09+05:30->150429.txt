Rahul Bose, who has produced, directed and acted in 'Poorna', a biopic on  , who scaled the   at the age of 13, was determined to show his film to   because he believed the Indian cricket captain would identify with the core of the story. "When I spoke to Virat, he suggested that I speak to Anil bhai (coach  ) and ask him if all the boys could watch the film with him before their Test Match in Pune," Rahul informed Mirror just before the show was to start.

  
  
 The boys in blue, who kick off the series against Australia on February 23, were to arrive in Pune on February 19 to begin practice. And it was an instant 'yes' from Rahul's longtime friend Anil. "The film is about a character beating all odds in the face of every bias -she is a girl, uneducated, from a tribal village in   and really poor. To top it, it's a real life story. What better film for the cricket team to watch before a match? I'm sure the boys will love the underlying message of the film," Rahul reasoned.
 
 On Sunday, at 7:30 pm, Anil and Virat, along with Sanjay Bangar, R Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Cheteshwar Pujara, Umesh Yadav, Abhinav Mukund, Karun Nair, K L Rahul, Wriddhiman Saha, R Shridhar, Patrick Farhat, Anil Patel, Ravinder Jadeja and Jayant Yadav caught the film at a Hinjawadi multiplex. The real   could not make it for this screening but she will be present at another preview show in Hyderabad ahead of the film's release on March 31 where her whole village is expected to turn up.
