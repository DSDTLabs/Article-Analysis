 There are slim chances of light rain in the city that may be the first spell of pre-monsoon showers. Isolated rain has been forecast for Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan, Goa, Vidarbha and   till March 18. A Met department official said that the showers may result from convective heating due to rising mercury.
 
 AK Srivastava, head of climate monitoring and analysis group at the  , told TOI that Pune may only witness some drizzling. “The chances of this too are less than 50%, though parts of Vidarbha have recently seen some rains. The rains may result from an interaction between the westerly system and easterlies. However, chances of rains are less as the circulation pattern is such that there is little moisture on the surface level,” he said.
