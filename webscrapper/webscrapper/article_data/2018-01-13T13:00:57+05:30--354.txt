BHUBANESWAR: If   had hoped for a reaction from   president and chief minister   following his diatribe on alleged bureaucratic highandedness in party affairs, he got his wish. But Naveen's response, without naming Baijayant, did not go down well with the Kendrapada MP and political observers feel it could farther alienate from the BJD. 

 "When they have no other issues, they attack my office. This is nothing new, Naveen told reporters on Friday the sidelines of a cultural programme here.
 
 While inaugurating an overhead water tank at Buhalo in Nischintakoili block of Cuttack district (under   segment) on Thursday, Baijayant, a four-time parliamentarian, had alleged that the ruling party is being run by bureaucrats.
 
 To queries whether he would seek explanation from the Kendrapada MP, Naveen responded: "Whatever is appropriate will be done. And I am busy with my development work for the state. People are well aware of what is going on."
 
 Baijayant, who celebrated his birthday here at his residence on Friday, took to twitter to express his displeasure minutes after Naveen's comment. 
 
 "Im very disheartened. Did Biju Babu also have no other issues when he demanded action against corrupt babus? If no issue, why 5 police platoons in Mahanga? Was it I who created disturbance in Mahanga? Was I not just doing my job peacefully? I still plead for my leader (Naveen) to examine," he tweeted.
 
 Many within the BJD feel Baijayant's outburst against the leadership could be because of his growing closeness towards the  , which is aspiring to stop Naveen from coming to power in   for a fifth consecutive term.
