NEW DELHI: Two days after gangster Manjeet Mahal’s father was   outside his house, a   footage has emerged showing how the 75-year-old victim was killed. Police have detained six associates of Mahal’s arch rivals.

 The footage from a camera installed outside the house shows the victim,  , wearing a white kurta and a turban bargaining with a vegetable seller along with his help Mukesh. A white Scorpio soon arrives and two men open fire at them. Mukesh ducks to avoid being shot. The men fire again and this time the bullet hits Kishan and he drops to the ground. Mukesh crawls into the nearby field.
 
 Two men wearing jackets step out of the vehicle, run towards Kishan, pump at least six bullets in his body and then speed off in the car. Mukesh later alerted Kishan’s family who rushed him to a hospital where he was declared brought dead.
 
 Police said that the Scorpio belongs to the prime suspect,  . Incidentally, a relative of Sangwan had used the same vehicle to visit Mahal’s house a month ago to “resolve” their differences. This relative, who is suspected of helping the shooters identify Kishan, is being traced.
 
 Sources said that after murdering Kishan, the shooters, probably from Bulandshahr, drove towards Palam Vihar near Dwarka and robbed a Toyota Fortuner SUV from a businessman’s driver. They then used it as a getaway vehicle. Two of the accused men, Ankush alias Bhaloo and Boxer, who were detained earlier are suspected to be involved in planning and executing the murder.
 
 Three family members of the accused suspected to be involved in the attack are also reported missing from their houses since Monday afternoon, sources added.
