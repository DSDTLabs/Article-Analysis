HUBBALLI: BJP national president   on Sunday invoked Madakari Nayaka, regarded one of the greatest rulers of Chitradurga, and warrior woman Onake Obavva, who took on the forces of Hyder Ali single-handedly to safeguard the Chitradurga Fort, to woo voters.

 
 “CM Siddaramaiah observes Tipu Jayanti. Why has he forgotten Madakari Nayaka and Obavva?” he told a party convention at Hiriyur town in Chitradurga district.
 
 He, however, had to face some embarrassment as the visit to Shreeshaila Mutt branch was cancelled as pontiff Channasiddarama Shivacharya Swami was unavailable. The pontiff was in Hadagali, Ballari district for some rituals.
 
 In Hiriyur too, Shah criticised Siddaramaiah for ignoring Nayaka and Obavva. He assured that if the BJP comes to power, the government will build memorials to them. “The memorials will catch the attention of the nation,” he said.
 
 Shah said he has come to Chitradurga thrice. “The response of the people is overwhelming. It shows the party will come to power in all constituencies of the district. The response across the state is also good,” he added.
 
 He alleged that the state government closed down sugar factories in the district and promised that they would be reopened if BS Yeddyurappa becomes CM. “Also, 5tmcft water will be released to the district from VV Sagar and factories will be reopened,” he said. Shah also asked people if they want a ‘commission government’ or ‘Kaam Ki’ government.
 
 Earlier, Shah visited Davanagere and went to the Durgamma Temple and offered a special puja for 10 minutes. Later, Shah went on a roadshow.
