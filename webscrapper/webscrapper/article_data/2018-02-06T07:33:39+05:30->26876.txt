HYDERABAD: Calling out on injustice done to   in the Union budget, chief minister   has directed TRS MPs in Parliament to increase their decibel level inside the   on the issue. This is likely to deepen the trouble for the NDA government, which is already facing wrath of its allies   and TDP.

 “Our proposal for nearly ?40,000 crore was not even considered and a meagre ?2,000 crore worth projects were granted. The mood of the state is to maintain good relations with the NDA government rather than indulge in blame. But when it comes to our rights, we will fight it out,” said a TRS MP.
 
 The MPs are expected to press the Centre to concede to the state’s demand for increasing the percentage of reservations for minorities. “The ceiling of 50% for reservations is not acceptable to the TRS. Since   has been granted quota beyond 50% cap, Telangana too wants a similar relief,” said another MP.
