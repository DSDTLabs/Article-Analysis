Chennai: Setting high standards for the  , and to ensure purity of the process, the Madras   has laid down stringent conditions for lawyers aspiring to contest the March 28 polls.

 Directing the Bar Council of India (BCI) to take a decision on the disqualification norms introduced by the special committee of its Tamil Nadu chapter, a division bench of Justice division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and R Tharani said that before finalising the nominations, all papers must be sent to the director-general of police to get a report about antecedents of the contestants.
 
 Candidatures of advocates who hold profit making posts like MP, MLA should be rejected, the bench said, adding that the   should provide armed protection right from dispatch of ballot papers from Chennai to all 169 polling booths, except the high court campus in Chennai and Madurai, till the results were declared.
 
 The returning officer of the election must accept nominations of only those candidates who produce at least 10 reported judgments and 5 contested judgments for each year in the previous five years or 25 contested judgments in total to prove that they were lawyers practising before the high court and subordinate courts. It also asked the   to form an exclusive team to prevent distribution of money by conducting raids, including on court campuses, where money had been distributed. The bench then directed the BCI to take a decision in the meeting to be held on February 18 on the rules prescribed by the special committee of Tamil Nadu Bar council, disqualifying advocates with less than 10 years of practice and those occupying posts in political parties from conducting the Bar polls. “It is shameful and unfortunate that the Bar election is conducted like a high stake byelection where the political parties will throw enormous money to woo the voters, the bench wondered whether the regulatory body has become money spinning factory,” rued the bench. Bribery, money power, caste, violence are synonyms of Indian election process, and the March 28 election to the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is no exception to this, it observed. The bench was passing interim orders on a plea moved to direct the Bar Council of India (BCI) to consider ratifying the rules prescribed by the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in connection with the Bar election.
