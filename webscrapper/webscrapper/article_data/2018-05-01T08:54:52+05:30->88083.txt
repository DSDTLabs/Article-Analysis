CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the decision of the Haryana government to give incentives to all the government doctors serving in difficult or remote areas. 

 The high court was of the view that the rationale to identify difficult and backward areas would have to be based on ground realities prevailing in the state and there could never be uniform yardstick or foolproof method to identify backward areas.
 
 “Socio-economic factors play a dominant role in ascertaining the backwardness of a particular area. A casual look at the blocks identified does not really throw up any serious discrepancies so as to discard the entire process altogether,” observed the high court while dismissing the plea filed by some doctors.
 
 The high court passed these orders while deciding a petition questioning the notification, issued by the state on January 17, 2017, identifying 46 blocks in different districts as remote and difficult areas for giving incentives under various schemes of the government.
 
 Petitioners in the case had also challenged the January 30, 2017, notification through which some community health centres and primary health centres were shown to confer incentives upon the in-service candidates.
 
 While dismissing the petitions, division bench headed by Justice Mahesh Grover observed that it was of the opinion that the Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, certainly gave the state needed authority to introduce a scheme of incentives to the in-service candidates with laudable object to ensure representation and service in community health centres and primary health centres in remote and difficult areas where doctors displayed reluctance to go to.
