HYDERABAD: Government chief whip P   and whip in the legislative council   on Monday said if TJAC chairman   was concerned about students, he should postpone the proposed rally on the issue of unemployment and follow the court's advise.

 “There is no need for Kodandaram to insist that the rally be held in Hyderabad. It can be held anywhere suggested by the police. With the technology that is available now, what he wants to say at the meeting will reach everyone,“ they said.
 
 TRS leaders said that Kodandaram did not have good intentions in holding the rally, especially when a large number of students were preparing for exams. “The facts speak for themselves. Thousands of jobs have already been provided. This is the reality. Kodandaram is spreading wrong information that the government has not provided any jobs,“ they said.
 
 “At least one crore youths and students prepare for competitive exams this month.The proposed rally will only disturb them,“ they said. He should at least abide by what the court has said instead of instigating students to serve his own political aspirations, they added.
