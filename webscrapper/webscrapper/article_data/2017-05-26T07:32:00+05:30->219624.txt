AMRITSAR: Sikhs in Manchester joined locals in observing a one-minute silence in the memory of those killed in the May  . Sikh taxi driver A J Singh (24), who hogged the media limelight after he turned off his taxi’s meter to offer free rides to people in need and arranged for 200 more cabs for the blast victims, on Thursday also organized a prayer meeting at Saint Ann’s Square.

 Besides, members of the community also accompanied local Hindus, to serve food and water and provide free taxis to take the injured to the hospital and others to the prayer’s venue.
 
 Talking to TOI over phone from Manchester on Thursday, Singh informed that Mancunians assembled on streets to remember the deceased and observed a minute’s silence during which traffic came to a halt. Later a memorial event was held at St. Ann’s Square where they paid floral tributes.
 
 “We had packed food and water in our cars and distributed during the meet. We also went to hospitals to distribute the same among the injured,” he said. 
 
 Singh also informed that on Thursday Queen Elizabeth also visited blast victims at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. “In this hour of grief we will get together and recite ‘Rehras Sahib’ (a Sikh prayer),” he said. Locals including children would be attending prayers to pay respect to the victims. “The Sikhs will be lighting candles and reciting Rehras prayer,” he said, adding that people now would not associate terrorism with Sikhs.
