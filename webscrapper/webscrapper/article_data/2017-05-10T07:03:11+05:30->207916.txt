IMPHAL:   chief minister and Naga People's Front ( ) supremo Shurhozelie   paid a courtesy call to his Manipuri counterpart   on Tuesday, and called for peaceful co-existence, putting behind the protracted strained relations between the two neighbouring states. 

  This is the first time that a Nagaland chief minister has come to Imphal to discuss bilateral issues. Shurhozelie's NPF is a coalition partner in the Biren Singh-led government in Manipur. 
 
  Stating that peaceful co-existence among different ethnic groups would bring about development in the region, Liezietsu underscored the need to live together as good neighbours, according to tradition that has existed since time immemorial. He also said that the Meiteis should play a leading role in fostering peace and friendship among the different ethnic communities in the region. 
 
  "Now people have seen hope. We have seen some of our leaders in the past who had exploited the situation for their selfish ends and created bad feelings among different communities," said the Nagaland CM at a media conference, after meeting Biren Singh. 
 
  "But now with the change here in Manipur, we believe the era is already over, not only in Nagaland and Manipur, but the whole Northeast. We should have that understanding because our needs are almost the same in every way," he said. 
 
 "We must now realize that when we have peace we can bring about development, but when there is no peace, as we have seen in the past, there is no development," he added.
