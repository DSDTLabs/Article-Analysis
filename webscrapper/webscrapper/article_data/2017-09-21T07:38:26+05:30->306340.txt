KOCHI: The   has closed the proceedings on a   petition filed by athlete P U   against the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) officials for not allowing her to participate in the World Athletics Championships held in London despite a court order.

 While deciding to close the   proceedings, a division bench of the court said there is no use in proceeding with the matter though the athlete was denied a chance to take part in the championships.
 
 During the hearing on Wednesday, Chitra’s counsel pointed out that the athlete won gold at the Asian Indoor Games held at Turkmenistan on Tuesday. Responding to the submission, the court criticized AFI, which is the apex body of athletics in India, and said the body destroyed the athlete’s confidence and hope by declining to include her in the Indian squad for the world championships.
 
 It was on July 28 that a single bench of the high court ordered AFI to allow Chitra to participate in the world championships beginning on August 4. The court had considered a petition filed by Chitra challenging her exclusion despite winning a gold medal in women’s 1,500m race at the Asian Athletics Championships held at Bhubaneswar.
