MUMBAI: A senior   minister in   on Tuesday said his party and its bickering ally   will lose the 2019 Assembly polls if they fight separately, adding that discussions for an alliance were still on. 

 "A Sena leader close to Shiv Sena chief   recently came to my house and we held talks about the alliance. Preserving the alliance is a necessity for both the parties, because if the   and NCP fight together and we contest separately, both parties will lose. If we come together, we will win around 190 seats (out of 288)," the minister said on condition of anonymity. 
 
 When asked about Uddhav's announcement that his party would fight all polls in future on its own, the minister pointed out that equations between the allies could change dramatically, as they did in Bihar.
 
 "Nitish Kumar had publicly insulted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but later he joined us. It will happen here as well," he said. "If a leader like Modi can accept Nitish for the sake of the country, we (state leaders) are small fry," he said.
 
 A large number of people in both the BJP and Sena want the alliance to continue, he claimed. "There will be so much pressure from people and party workers that alliance will become inevitable," he said.
 
 When asked for a reaction, a senior Sena leader denied that any such talks are in progress. Uddhav Thackeray had announced last month that his party would have no tie-up with BJP in future elections and he had accused the latter of trying to upstage the Sena on its home turf. agencies
