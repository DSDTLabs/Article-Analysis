BHOPAL: In a development which is sure to cheer up students, all areas across the state will enjoy uninterrupted   from March 1. The areas also include where   was snapped on account of non-payment of dues. 

 The decision was taken following chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s instruction to ensure uninterrupted power supply during examination time so that studies do not get affected. Observers feel the government would not like to antagonise students in the state, which is to go to assembly polls before the end of the year . “We will not insist for depositing 20% of outstanding before resuming power supply to transformers whose connection was snapped due to non-payment. This is being done to ensure supply during examination time and ensure drinking water supply is not affected due to non-availability of power,” principal secretary power ICP Keshari told TOI. 
 
 Sources said the move would surely get appreciated by students during examination time, but it will lead to additional burden on discoms as the situation is mostly faced in areas where per unit recovery of discoms is low. There are lot of non-paying or defaulting consumers. It is mainly in small towns or village areas. 
 
 Discoms have been instructed to gear up for reducing problems faced by consumers and address complaints within minimal possible time.
 
 An official, requesting anonymity, said, “In cities like Bhopal, major power supply issues are faced only when there is heavy rainfall or storm. But these situations are natural hazards. Even if we increase our manpower to tackle these situation, additional manpower is required only in times of problems, which hardly occur once or twice in every six months. But this additional manpower will push our establishment cost.”
