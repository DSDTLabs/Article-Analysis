The 24-member-team of students from   hogged all the limelight at the fourth edition of the   held in Coimbatore on January 17. The 125-kg kart designed by the city team,  , won top honours at the championship in which 186 teams from all over the country participated. The teams were judged on five parameters — assembly, brake, acceleration, skid pad and endurance. “We were able to assemble the 125 kg kart in just 10 minutes while the other teams took about 25 minutes. And our kart won second position in the rest of the categories,” explains   a member of the design team adding, “Instead of a CVT engine that our seniors used last year, we opted for a manual transmission engine from a 125cc bike, and that gave the kart more torque and efficiency. The top speed of the kart is around 70 kmph. We also added an adjustable steering wheel and used a grade of mild steel that was lighter and stronger.” 
 Costing `1.5 lakhs, the kart took one-month to build. “There were days when we’d all sleep in the college workshop after working till around two or three in the morning. The plastic flexis that we found in the workshop became our make shift beds. We were just focussed on getting the kart ready on time,” recalls  .
 The team has set their sights on bigger goals now. “We want to create at least 30 karts this year and sell them in the market. That will help us understand the whole cycle of entrepreneurship. In fact, by building this kart, we’ve learned a lot more about our subjects than the theory classes. And it’s way more exciting than the classes,” shares Pallavi, signing off.
