JALANDHAR: Farmers led by   visited the vegetable market and other places during the early hours of the day and told all the farmers not to bring vegetables, fodder or milk to the city till June 10. They also visited the   milk plant here and told those bringing milk there not to bring it from Saturday till June 10. 

 “We reached the mandi in the wee hours and have told the farmers there not to bring the vegetables to the market from Saturday. We did not want to cause damage to anybody so spread the message widely on Friday and from Saturday we would fully enforce the boycott of the vegetables, fodder and milk markets or purchase centres. Farmers are not getting enough price for the produce while the middlemen take the major cut and these reach to the consumers at high prices. We are demanding that a mechanism be formed so that farmers get decent prices of their produce,” said the committee’s president  .
 
 “When farmers are not getting reasonable price for their produce this pushes them in the debt trap and then towards the suicide. From Saturday, anybody bringing these things to the cities would be responsible for the loss,” he and other committee leaders threatened.
 
 Later in the day, farmers led by   (Qadian) members came in front of the district administrative complex to protest against the hike in diesel prices. They came on their tractors. It was quite a scene as the farmers came on several tractors for handing over keys to the   who assured them that their issues would be conveyed to the government. They also complained that power supply was not enough to the farms.
