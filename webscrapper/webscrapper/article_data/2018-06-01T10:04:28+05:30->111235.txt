PARIS: British number three   laughed off an Argentinian radio reporter's mistake in confusing him with action movie icon and martial arts star  , saying he supposes it's "an honour".

 
 Norrie forced his second-round match with   into a second day by taking the third set late on Wednesday, but couldn't pull off a Norris-like comeback on Thursday.
 
 "I know he's pretty famous. And it was actually quite funny. When I went to Argentina for pre-season, they actually thought my name was "Chuck Norris" at the team I played for," said Norrie, who lost 2-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-7 (3/7).
 
 "So it was pretty funny. And, I mean, I guess it's an honour to be compared to him."
