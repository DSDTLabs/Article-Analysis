Hyderabad: A face-off between actor-turned-politician   and IT and handloom minister   is in the offing. Even as   is going all out to promote handloom for the benefit of weavers, the   leader on Tuesday declared that he would participate in a satyagraha, to be organised by weavers unhappy with the policies of both the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments. 

 "I have not been a brand ambassador for any commercial products. But after listening to the problems of weavers, I have decided to be the brand ambassador for handlooms products," Pawan Kalyan told a delegation of   at his party office.
 
 While acknowledging that various efforts have been made by the governments to promote handloom, he said there was a coordination problem somewhere. "Many handloom weavers are suffering and resorting to suicides. I will participate in a satyagraha to be their voice," the actor said.
 
 The delegation said that though the Telangana government had announced that it would come out with a handloom policy soon, it had failed to do so. 
 
 In recent days, minister KTR has enlisted the support of various film and sports personalities and asked them to don handloom to boost the sector.
