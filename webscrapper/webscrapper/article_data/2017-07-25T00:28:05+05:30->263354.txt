Coimbatore: The lack of parking space has been a long-term problem in city’s commercial spots like Town Hall, Gandhipuram and R S Puram. In order to resolve this issue, the city corporation has finally called for tenders for multi-level car parking projects that are to be set up in three locations.

 The project was announced in 2011 and had been delayed due to the lack of funds. The tenders will be finalised in September this year and the project will be completed by 2019. Officials said that apart from the car parking, commercial complexes will be set up to generate revenue.
 
 Tamil Nadu Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (TUFIDCO), who prepared a detailed project report, will fund the project. The multi-level car parking will accommodate two-wheelers and four-wheelers. “The first two levels will be for two-wheelers and the other levels will be for four-wheelers,” an engineer said.
 
 The corporation will offer it at a subsidized rate to people. Furthermore, the parking lots will be fully automated and the contractor will fully maintain it for 30 years. 
 
 “The operation and maintenance will be part of the   and they will be in-charge for it. Commercial complexes will also be set up. Shops will be leased out and given on rent to generate revenue,” an official said. The revenue in turn will be used to maintain the parking space.
 
 As per the officials, the project will be completed soon. “The traffic on Cross-Cut Road, Gandhipuram, Town Hall, R S Puram will soon come down. We always find it difficult to find parking spaces, which delay our outing by more than an hour. While some shopping complexes have valet parking, not all the roads provide the facility,” R Usha, a resident said.
