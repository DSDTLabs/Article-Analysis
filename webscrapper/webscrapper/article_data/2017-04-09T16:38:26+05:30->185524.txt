Kanan Gill and Sonakshi Sinha, who are going to play BFFs in an upcoming movie, are like best friends in real life too. In a recent chat with TV actor and host Karan Singh Chhabra they seemed to be having a lot of fun.   While on the set of The Asian Variety Show when Karan asked Sonakshi to share 2 things about Kanan she quickly replied “He has got big hips” and made up for the statement by saying “well secondly, he is also a good actor”. Hearing this the stand-up comedian turned actor seemed a bit embarrassed and asked the Dabangg girl “Didn’t you have any other good thing to share about me?”    Karan said “It was a very funny moment when Sonakshi revealed some fun facts about Kanan and the shooting days of Noor. To wrap it up on a light note all we could say is Hips don’t lie!”    Kanan Gill, who created a buzz across the cyberspace with ‘Pretentious Movie Reviews’ , is apparently gearing up to make his acting debut in this forthcoming movie -‘Noor’.    The film is an adaptation of Pakistani writer Saba Imtiaz's 2014 novel, ‘Karachi, You Are Killing Me!’ and will see Sonakshi Sinha in a leading role.
