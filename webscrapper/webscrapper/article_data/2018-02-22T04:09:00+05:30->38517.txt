Vadodara: It will be a test of skills for the physically challenged cricket players from the country.  For the first time ever, the national team of physically challenged cricketers will play a test cricket match in the city. The team will play against Afghanistan in the Modi Dosti Cup that will be held at Gujarat Refinery ground for three days beginning March 26.  “It will be world’s first day and night test match for the disabled cricketers. They will play the match with pink ball. The players are all excited as it will be the test of their skills as well,” said Nitendra Singh, director, cricket operations, Physically Challenged Cricket Association of India.  “When we came up with the idea of organizing a test match for the disabled, many countries expressed interest in participating. But we chose to play first with Afghanistan as it a friendly country,” Singh told TOI. The tourney will be played as per International Cricket Council (ICC) rules. Disabled persons will umpire in the match and the scorers will be physically challenged women. “This tourney is being organized by the Baroda Disabled Cricket Association. We have sponsors but we have also approached the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for help. Once this test match happens, more such matches will happen across the country,” Singh added.  Apart from the test match, some one-day and T20 matches for the disabled too will be held in the city. Singh said that PM Narendra Modi has been trying hard to uplift the Divyang and his dream too is to bring the disabled as close to the normal people as possible. “We will be inviting Gujarat CM, Vijay Rupani for the event,” he added.
