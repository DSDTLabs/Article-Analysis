Actor  , who will be seen in the Hindi remake of  's " ", says he is looking forward to hear praises from the ace filmmaker. 

 "Ok Jaanu" is the official remake of Mani Ratnam's superhit Tamil film, "Ok Kanmani". 
 
 "We have heard he (Mani Ratnam) has seen the film. He is the co-producer, so he would have seen the film and he has loved it. We are looking forward to see him praise us in person," Aditya told . 
 
 
 
 The Tamil version starred Dulquer Salmaan and Nithya Menen in the lead roles, which is being reprised by Aditya and Shraddha Kapoor in the Hindi remake. 
 
 "It was nice to see Dulquer tweet about our trailer (of 'Ok Jaanu'). We haven't met Dulquer and Mani sir (Mani Ratnam). We have been trying to meet him but he is out of Mumbai. The schedules have not matched. We are not lucky enough to meet him," he said. 
 
 The 31-year-old "Fitoor" actor says he is aware of the comparisons being drawn between "Ok Jaanu" and "Ok Kanmani". 
 
 "When a remake is loved you know there will be comparisons. But you can't lose sleep over it. One just has to make the film with the best of their abilities and the reason why it is made again is because it has been loved so much," he said. 
 
 "It (remake) gives us confidence more than pressure as the screenplay has been appreciated. You don't get to taste the waters before for every film except remakes," he added. 
 
 In the film, Aditya and his co-star Shraddha will be seen as a young couple in a live-in relationship based in Mumbai, and when the actor was asked if he would ever opt for it, he quips, "I have not done it before...so, I can't speak about the experience." 
 
 "If I am in a relationship with someone if..I feel I want to live with that person for a while, I don't see any reason why it can be a negative thing."
