Panaji: Forest department officials rescued a gaur in Mollem on Monday that was caught in a snare trap. They attributed the straying into inhabited areas to low water availability in waterholes. 

 “Age-old waterholes in the forests don’t have enough water. Animals are bound to look for alternative sources of water to quench their thirst,” a forest official said.
 
 Gaurs have been visiting areas where there are horticulture plantations in search of food and water. The increased frequency of such encounters has created fear among villagers, forcing them to lay snare traps; an act which is illegal.
 
 “Laying out traps for gaur, which is the state animal, is tantamount to hunting. It’s illegal,” said a forest wildlife official. The officials are yet to identify the people who laid the trap.
