Hyderabad: As Congress' 'praja chaitanya bus yatra' is set to commence on Monday, Telangana   president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the current   party is different from the one that existed in 2015. "The yatra will trigger a revolution that will see Congress being voted to power in Telangana," Reddy said. 

 Addressing 'Atmeeya Sammelan' of old NSUI and Youth Congress leaders on Sunday, Reddy said the bus yatra was not a show of strength but an instrument to expose the failures of TRS government and give a platform to people to express their disappointment with the current government. "  tried to wipe out Congress from by either bribing or intimidating MPs, MLAs and MLCs. The   also made claims that after   and Amit Shah's visit it would come to power in Telangana. However, Congress bravely fought TRS's intimidating tactics and strengthened the party. Congress is all set to return to power in next elections," Uttam said.
 
 He charged KCR of remaining focussed on growth of his family and neglecting the public. The Congress would ask TRS to either distribute the promised 3 acre land to each Dalit family or deposit 15 lakh each in their bank account. TNN
