NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has launched a manhunt for a “high-profile” woman after a Lok Sabha MP complained to the top brass that he was drugged and filmed in an objectionable position by a gang led by the woman, who demanded extortion money of Rs 5 crore, sources told TOI. 

 The gang has allegedly threatened to release his pictures and videos if the demand was not met. The woman has also threatened to implicate the MP in a rape case, it was learnt. 
 
 When contacted, special commissioner Mukesh Meena confirmed that the case was under investigation. Police are treating the case as top priority and arrests are likely soon.An FIR has been filed under section 384 (extortion) of the IPC. 
 
 
 
 
 In his complaint, the MP has claimed that the woman had sought some help from him and asked him to accompany her to a house in Ghaziabad, where he was given sedatives mixed in a soft drink. The MP passed out. He realized he had been trapped when he regained his senses. After getting the complaint, the police chief immediately ordered the registration of an FIR. 
 
 A special team has been formed to crack the case. If required, the case may be transferred to the crime branch or special cell, the officer added. 
 
 Initial probe has revealed that the woman allegedly runs a blackmailing ring and works with a number of associates, an officer said. "We have found that her modus operandi is to approach parliamentarians on pretext of seeking help and then befriend them by her smooth talk. She then takes them to her house for tea and then clicks their pictures in objectionable poses. After that, she demands money or a high flying job. If refused, she threatens to register a fake case of rape,” an investigator said. 
 
 The woman had allegedly lodged a false case against another MP last year, police sources claimed. The details of this case are being verified.
