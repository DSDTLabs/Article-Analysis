HYDERABAD: Defending the TRS government’s decision to change the intake point site of   lift irrigation project from   to Medigadda, irrigation minister   told the   that the decision was taken after the Central Water Commission’s report on availability of water.

 The CWC has said that water availability in Godavari river would be around 42 TMC at Tummidihatti and 141TMC at Medigadda. “So the government decided to shift the intake point to Medigadda, which can cater to the needs of 19 districts,” said the minister. The step has also reduced submergence and paved the way for an agreement with Maharashtra.
 
 Answering a question during a debate in the Assembly on Saturday, the minister said the change of intake point was taken after a series of deliberations with water, agriculture and power experts.
 
 Replying to allegations that   project was shelved to take up Kaleshwaram, the minister pointed out that Pranahita project, with a capacity of 14 TMC, would not have provided water to 37 lakh acres additional ayacut.
