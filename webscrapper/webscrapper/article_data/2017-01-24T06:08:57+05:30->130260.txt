AHMEDABAD: The celebratory mood suddenly turned sombre just before the inauguration of new Gomtipur police station on Monday evening when family members of a 10-year-old boy entered the premises and sought justice for Vivek who was bludgeoned to death in Khokhra recently. 

 “How can you celebrate opening of a new police station when you have failed to arrest the killers of my son even after six months,” asked a teary-eyed  , mother of the boy, as city police chief A K Singh and DGP ( )   watched her. The top police officials were waiting for MoS, home, Pradeepsinh Jadeja to arrive.
 
 Caught completely off-guard, the cops present there immediately swung into action and persuaded Kamlaben, the victim’s father  , his handicapped brother Avinash and sister Aarti, to move inside the yet-to-be-inaugurated police station.
