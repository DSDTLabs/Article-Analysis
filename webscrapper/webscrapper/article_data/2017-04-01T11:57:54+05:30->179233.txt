VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government received flak for holding the lottery of liquor shops on   campus. Educationists described it as a black day. 

 Enraged students marched towards the administrative building and demanded that it should not be conducted.
 
 B  , president of YSR Students’ Union, said, “It is unfortunate that the authorities are behaving like touts and agents of the TDP. They seem to be totally under the influence of the state government.” 
 
 The authorities were caught unawares. The registrar said, “ We were unaware of the nature of the event and will not allow such events to be conducted on the campus.”
