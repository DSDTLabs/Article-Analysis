GURUGRAM:   is going to embark on an anti-encroachment mission soon to drive out squatters from new sectors of 58-67, to expedite work on sewerage and drainage lines, water pipelines and roads. 

 Sources claimed that the development had completed the acquisition of land required for putting in place the basic civic amenities, but the work in most places had run into encroachments and illegal construction. Around 80% of the construction is complete, but farmhouses in sectors 57-58, shops near Kulawas village in sectors 64-65 and random structures in   63 have held up the remaining 20% of the work.
 
 “We inspected the areas and identified the encroachments. These will be removed soon,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav, adding that removal of those structures would ensure early completion of work related to water, sewerage and drainage system.
 
 The cash-strapped urban development body has divided the new sectors 58-115 into five zones — 58-67, 68-74, 75-80, 81-90 and 91-115 — to complete infrastructure development work in a phased manner.
