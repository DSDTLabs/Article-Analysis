AMBALA: A 30-year-old woman was allegedly murdered in   on Monday by her husband and in-laws for giving birth to two daughters.

 The alleged   came to light after a complaint by the victim’s brother on Tuesday. Naraingarh resident Sonia had died due to brain haemorrhage on Tuesday morning.   police here have registered a case under Section 304B (dowry death) of the IPC against her husband Ravi Kumar Verma, sister-in-law Rita, and mother-in-law Bimla Devi. 
 
 Sonia was rushed to a Naraingarh hospital on Monday night when her condition got serious, from where doctors referred her to Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, in Chandigarh. It was informed that Sonia died during her treatment over there on Tuesday.
 
 Sonia had been living in Shahzadpur with her husband and in-laws. The brother of the deceased, Neeraj Kumar, came to the police station on Wednesday and alleged that her in-laws used to harass her for giving birth to two daughters.
 
 Neeraj alleged that his sister married Ravi in 2013 and that the family of the deceased had given a dowry amount that was much more than what they could have afforded, but the in-laws were still not happy.
 
 He alleged that only a few months of the marriage, the in-laws again started to demand dowry, which the family of the deceased could not provide them due to their poor financial condition. He alleged that the in-laws of Sonia started to harass he over little mistakes. When she gave birth to two daughters, they started to harass more, he alleged.
 
 He said that his sister was depressed. ASI Gian Chand, who is the investigating officer in the case, confirmed the registration of a case. “We had gone to the home of the accused, but they were in Haridwar. We will conduct an inquiry once they come back and would take further action on the basis of the investigation,” the ASI said.
