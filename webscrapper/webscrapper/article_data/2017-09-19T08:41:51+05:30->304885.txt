LUCKNOW: Reacting sharply to   government's white paper on performance of the   government in the state, Leader of Opposition and senior SP leader   said BJP was voted to power to work and develop the state and not to waste time blaming past governments.

 Chaudhary told TOI, “All attempts of the BJP to tar nish the image of SP national president   will fail, as in five years of his government he did not face any corruption charges.“ He added that the white paper released by the BJP on Monday was “admission of the Aditya Nath Yogi government of its failures on all fronts, be it development, law and order or maintaining peace in the state“.
 
 Chaudhary also questioned why Yogi government had not announced a single new project or social welfare scheme in the last six months and was instead tou ring the state to look for a `ghapla' (scandal) of the previous regime.
 
 “Metro rail, Gomti Riverfront, Agra Expressway, 11 medical colleges, six agriculture colleges and a number of universities established are proof of Akhilesh Yadav's progressive vision, while Samajwadi Pension, Lohia Housing, and Janeshwar Mishra village development schemes showed his commitment towards welfare of the weaker sections,“ said the SP leader.
 
 He condemned strongly Yogi's “goli ka jawab goli se“ (bullet for a bullet) warning to criminals, saying it was an undemocratic way to function. Chaudhary lamented that BJP government was playing a cruel joke on farmers by writing off their dues amounting as low as 40 paise and Rs 1.50.
