Indore: With cupid striking the hearts of many youngsters, city was painted in red on Wednesday. Youngsters flocked cafes and restaurants to celebrate the day of love with their beaus and friends.

 "It’s the first time that I am celebrating Valentine’s Day with my boyfriend who was in another city for three years," said college student, Simran Patel. The 20-year-old who has planned the whole day is excited about surprises that she has kept for her boyfriend.
 
 With red being the colour of the day, many youngsters were seen in red. They even colour-coordinated their dresses. "I had already told my boyfriend to wear blue so that we match. Also, red is too mainstream on Valentine's," said professional, Oshin Thakur who was celebrating the day at a Vijay Nagar-based cafe with her Valentine and thereafter plans to go to a resort to make the day even more special.
 
 While price of roses and other flowers remained a pinch to the pockets, ranging from Rs 50/- rose, from offering complimentary drinks to decoration of shacks and canopies, many city-based restaurants, and cafes soothed the heart of the couples with their exclusive offers.
 
 Engineer Hemant Singh who had no plans to celebrate the day of love, got excited to see offers and decided to make it memorable with his friends. He took off for the day said, "I am going to attend the beer fest that will take place in the afternoon with a few friends. I am happy with the offers."
 
 Apart from many couples who are celebrating the day with their beloveds, there are several youngsters who have tried to make the day special for others, especially the underprivileged children.
 
 "We wanted to spread the message of love even to those who do not get to experience the meaning of love," said Karan Shinde, who along with his friends distributed chocolates to many slum kids.
