THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Though everything happened quickly – the alleged ‘lewd’ conversation of ex-transport minister   and his subsequent resignation – the police did not specify whether it would take any action in the case on Sunday.

 Sources in the department said that it was unlikely that the police would take action unless the woman, whose voice was heard in the clip, filed a complaint. The department is also open to a probe, if Saseendran files a complaint or if the government gives a specific directive to conduct a probe.
 
 Meanwhile, Wadakkanchery MLA Anil Akkara forwarded a complaint to the state police chief to register a case and arrest the politician.“Sexual atrocities are on a rise and women of all ages, including children, are falling prey to sexual atrocities on a daily basis. The police, under the LDF government, have hereby built a reputation of saving the accused in such cases through their lackadaisical attitude.
 
 
 The police are yet to take action after a woman filed a ‘rape complaint’ against a CPM leader in Wadakkanchery. Police must take swift action in this case and ensure that Saseendran is punished,” he said in his complaint.
 
 Police sources said that action on the complaint would be taken by state police chief Loknath Behera after he arrives in Kerala on Monday.
