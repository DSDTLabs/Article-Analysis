 According to civic sources, the delay in executing the second phase was due to lack of response from bidders and encroachment on the stretch, which is in shoddy condition due to lack of maintenance.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sanjay Desai,   executive engineer, said that the project was pending for quite some time. 
 
 “Work order to commence the job will be placed at the earliest as the standing committee approved the financial bid recently. We had to re-tender the project due to lack of interest among bidders.”
 
 He added that they will also remove all illegal shops and slums along the existing two-lane asphalt road to pave way for construction of the four-lane road.
 
 NMMC has already thrown open a 4.9-km stretch between   and Rabale to the motorists. 
 
 Many commuters said that they enjoy using the stretch between Mahape and Rabale as they are able to bypass the busy Thane-Belapur Road.
 
 “But we have to go back on the arterial road and get stuck in traffic snarls, as the stretch between Rabale and Mukand is still not finished,” said Kalwa resident  .
 
 Many motorists said that NMMC should have simultaneously worked on the Rabale-Mukand stretch along with the Mahape-Rabale section, in order to reduce the travelling time between Thane and Navi Mumbai.
 
 Desai added that once the 5.4 km concrete stretch is completed, it will reduce the load on Kalwa-Kharegaon-Mumbra-Shilphatta roads and also decongest Thane-Belapur Road.
