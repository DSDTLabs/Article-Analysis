GURUGRAM: The forest department has decided to build an earthen dam in Gurgaon’s   village with an aim to provide enough water to leopards and other wild animals in the   so that they do not stray into inhabited areas in search of water. 

 On November 24 last year, a   was killed in Mandawar village in a case of man-animal conflict.
 
 The water percolation and recharging dam will be built in an area of 180 square metres at a cost of Rs 48.50 lakh and a tender has already been floated inviting companies to come forward for construction of the dam.
 
 Forest department officials said that leopards and other wild animals end up straying into villages in search of food and water and thus, building a dam would restrict their movement. 
 
 “While we have reported leopard sightings at many places across the Aravalis, the maximum number of sightings have been reported from  ,” said a senior forest official.
 
 Recounting the benefits of constructing earthen dams in the foothills of the Aravalis, the official said, “Most rainwater flows down from the Aravalis to the foothills where the sandy soil soaks up rainwater. By constructing such earthen dams we can store most of the rainwater for groundwater recharge. We are expecting 25-50% of rainwater to percolate through such earthen dams in the area.”
 
 An official from the wildlife department said, “Even though we have been sending water tankers regularly to the Aravalis to fill up water holes dug by the department for wild animals, we have not been able to meet the actual requirement due to cost constraints.”
 
 As many as eight leopard sightings and four leopard rescue operations in and around Gurgaon in the last four months are evident of the increasing presence of wild cats in the Aravalis.
 
 The dam is expected to be ready within a month once construction begins.
