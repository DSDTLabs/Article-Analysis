LUCKNOW: The ‘high-command syndrome’, once Congress’s disease, now seems to have inflicted   as well. 

 And it is tormenting BJP legislators who feel that despite having won 325 seats out of 403, they didn’t have much say in the selection of the new CM. 
 
 None of the three — the CM and two Deputy CMs — are legislators. While CM-designate   and one deputy CM   are MPs, the other deputy Dinesh Sharma is Lucknow mayor.
 
 “What’s the difference in BJP and   as both are ruled by the invisible   and there is no space for state leaders and workers in decision making,” said an MLC, asking, “Despite so many experienced leaders among MLAs, why are none of them being elevated as the CM?” 
 
 It is not only the CM’s name that was finalised by the high command, most of the ministers would also be picked up by central leaders in Delhi. “It was for this reason majority of MLAs had been camping in Delhi since March 11,” he said.
 
 “It was the Congress culture that the high command would make or mar the fortunes of regional leaders and no CM was decided in states. The same is gripping BJP as well,” says another UP leader.
