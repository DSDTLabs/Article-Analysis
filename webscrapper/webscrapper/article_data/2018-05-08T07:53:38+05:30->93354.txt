PANAJI/MAPUSA/COLVA:   balls continued to surface on some stretches of the state’s coastline, inconveniencing tourists and bathers, while staff of   attempted to clean the affected areas.

 Blobs of oil washed up on the Arambol, Ashvem and Morjim beaches in the Pernem taluka. In  , a film of oil was noticed at Calangute, but on the southern beach of   and Sinquerim, the oil was thicker and sticky. “Tourists found it difficult to wash off the taint of the tar balls,” a tourism stakeholder said.
 
 Waves brought in more tar balls to the   and Caranzalem beaches in   on Monday, even as Drishti Marine lifeguards were seen cautioning people with young children about the sticky matter. 
 
 In Salcete, tar balls surfaced from   at the southern end to Colva beach and beyonda long stretch of 10 to12km.
 
 This is a common phenomenon before the onset of the monsoon as winds and turbulent seas reject waste and redirect it towards the shore. It has, however, not deterred tourists visiting beaches along the state’s coastline. Unmindful of the thick layer of the oily matter on many stretches, holidaymakers were seen enjoying in the sea and even walking over the tar balls. Some domestic tourists, nevertheless, complained of itchiness after emerging from the water.
 
 In most parts, the staff of Drishti Marine gathered the tar balls and buried them on higher parts of the beaches. “Wherever the quantities are more, we gather and send them to the   garbage treatment plant,” a worker said.
