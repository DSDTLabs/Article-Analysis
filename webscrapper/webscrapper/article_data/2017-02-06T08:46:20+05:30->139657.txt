ALLAHABAD: Medical aspirants in city continued their agitation for third consecutive day to register their protest against the new eligibility norms for National Eligibility Entrance Test 2017 on Sunday.

 In a recent order, the Union HRD ministry set the upper age limit for students appearing for medical examinations across the country at 25 and restricted the number of times a candidate could appear for NEET to three attempts. The protesting students said the rules should have been implemented a year ago, when the students were preparing for their exams. 
 
 After staging demonstrations for the past two days, city’s medical aspirants surrounded the Central Board of Secondary Education’s regional office, which conducts the entrance examination, on Monday.
 
 “The sudden announcement has come as a shock for the students who were preparing for NEET for the past one year. Thousands of students have prepared for the exams and many of them have become ineligible because of the age restriction as it applies to all category of students. The government should have announced the decision a year before the exams,” said  , a medical aspirant who participated in the protest.
 
 “We have less than three months to prepare for the exams as CBSE will conduct NEET on May 7. We are compelled to stage demonstrations due to the government’s untimely decisions,” said  , another protester.
 
 Earlier, the students were confused whether the rule would come into effect this year or not. However on February 3, Medical   clarified that the restriction on the number of attempts would be implemented from 2017 onwards. 
 
 Suman Yadav, a medical aspirant in city, said, “There should be a minimum age limit for appearing for NEET but the announcement regarding the number of attempts should be revoked with immediate effect.”
