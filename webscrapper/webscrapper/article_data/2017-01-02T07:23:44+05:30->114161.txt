BENGALURU: The   is set to go digital in 2017 with   (ITS) and  , but services on the ground are likely to be hit. On the one hand, it   on many   and on the other, it is unable to procure new buses because the corporation cannot buy diesel buses.

 BMTC MD Ekroop Caur told TOI: “Tenders are ready to be floated to procure 658 buses right away. It will take a maximum of three to six months for manufacturers to deliver these. We have to procure 2,658 new buses in phases, and 700 in the first phase will be used to replace old buses at the earliest. But a petition filed contests that these new buses will be fuelled by diesel. The   has stayed the tendering process.“
 
 The petition, filed by Vinay Shivanand Naik from Mathikere, north Bengaluru, was admitted in the southern bench of the green tribunal on August 16. For the BMTC, it's a devil and the deep sea situation.
 
 BMTC follows a scrapping policy where a bus that has travelled 8.5 lakh kilometres or served 10 years since deployment, whichever is first, is discarded. So while it has to scrap 1,000 buses in all, repairs are not too cheap either.
 
 Repairing an old bus costs more than Rs 1.5 lakh, officials in the corporation told TOI.
 
 “I have given instructions not to invest more than Rs1.5 lakh on an old bus. We have to scrap old buses and the effect will hit commuters badly, which is why we stopped at discarding 250 for this financial year,“ she added.
 
 Another fallout could be the BMTC losing the Centre's fund for procuring new buses, granted through JnNURM funds. “The scheme is already shut down and before it was completely wrapped up, we've had to struggle to convince the Centre and get funds to buy 1,000 new buses, at least. But if the litigation goes on for long, we might lose the fund to buy these buses. The whole process of buying new buses will get delayed and pressure to replace old buses is increasing,“ Caur added.
