SANTINIKETAN: A chance remark by chief minister   raised hopes that negotiations on the   water sharing might be revived, although Sheikh Hasina refrained from raising the issue during her meeting with   and   here on Friday.

 
 Referring to the relations between India and  , Mamata said: “Dui desher samparke onek jol gariyeche. Aro onek jal gorabe. E bhabei du desher samparka aro drirah hobe (A lot of water has flowed under the bridge. A lot more will flow and continue to strengthen the ties between the two nations).”
 
  
  
 
 While Banerjee’s statement may have been a Bengali expression devoid of any reference to Teesta water, Bangladeshi diplomats were buoyed by her remarks and said it would surely figure in the talks when she meets Hasina at an iftaar party prior to the latter’s departure for Dhaka on Saturday evening.
 
 Bangladesh state minister for foreign affairs   said: “Track two diplomacy on the issue is already underway. We are talking about not just Teesta, but 52 rivers that flow through the countries,” he remarked.
