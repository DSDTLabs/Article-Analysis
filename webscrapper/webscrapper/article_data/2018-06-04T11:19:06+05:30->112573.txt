MOHALI: Sending families to other cities. Arranging for generators. Making official trips. That’s how Zirakpur residents are planning to escape the 35-hour rotational power cuts on Monday and Tuesday.

 The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) announced the power cuts from 6am on Monday till 5pm on Tuesday to upgrade transformers.
 
 N S Rangi, additional superintending engineer, operations division, PSPCL, Zirakpur, said, “Grid transformers will be upgraded to sustain peak load hours in summer and monsoon. There will be no inconvenience to residents as electricity supply to all feeding lines at   sub-station will be ensured turn-wise on rotational basis. Electricity supply to any area will not be affected beyond two hours at a stretch.”   said no power cut would be imposed on any area getting supply from Bhawat sub-station.
 
 But residents said PSPCL failed to act on time and instead of upgrading the transformers during June, they should have carried out the work before summer. “They must have done this a month ago, when there was not much need of power and residents could have sustained the restrictions. When the authorities are determined to make us suffer, we have no option other than inverters and hand fans, but inverters will also not work for such a long time,” said Manoj Das, a local resident.  , another resident, said, “I have sent my family to my in-laws’ place, and thank God, I am on an official trip. So I will be out of Zirakpur during the darkest hours.” Unlike him, many others will be grappling in the dark for hours.
