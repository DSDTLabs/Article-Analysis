AMRITSAR: Pakistan, on Sunday, repatriated an Indian national nearly one year after he inadvertently crossed over to the neighbouring country. According to sources in the immigration department,  , 23, a resident of Julah Majra village in Nawanshahr district, was handed over to Border Security Force ( ) personnel from Attari international border near Amritsar.

 Dalvinder was found in Pakistan on March 6, 2017. Sources said he had been working in Dubai since 2012 but was sent back to India in 2014 by a relative due to work stress. Thereafter, he suffered from depression and underwent treatment at Dr Vidyasagar Institute of Mental Health in Amritsar. In the course of his treatment, he went missing from hospital on March 5, 2017 and his family members lodged a missing complaint at   police station.
 
 A few weeks later, Pakistan   informed the BSF about him having crossed the border. Sources said he went to Pakistan from the Khemkaran sector and reached Kasur town.
 
 It took the Pakistan government nearly one year to complete legal formalities for his deportation. In the meantime, sources said he was given medical treatment.
