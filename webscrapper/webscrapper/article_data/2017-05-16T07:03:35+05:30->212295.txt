MUMBAI: Tepid student response to its post-graduate medical courses that cost close to a crore a year has prompted Pune's   to offer a discount to aspirants seeking admission in preand para-clinical courses at the post graduate level.

 But it has not deterred other colleges from asking for the moon. Private medical colleges in   are charging fees in dollars and some institutes in southern India are providing a broad range for tuition, thus keeping the state in the dark about the actual transaction value (see box).
 
 “The colleges that demanded crores as donation in cash are now coming up with other methods like giving a band of fees that they could charge,“ said a   member. He explained that students who can pay in cash would be given a better stream. In the book of accounts, only the lower fee will be reflected; the rest would be taken in cash.
 
 At Kashibai Navale, unpopular courses like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, microbiology would all be charged at Rs 9.6 lakh as decided by the state's Fee Regulation Authority.
 
 “It has not been easy to get students to pay hefty fees as the students are being sent by respective state governments. Earlier, agents appointed by medical colleges would look for those who wanted to be doctors and were willing to pay for it.All that changed with   and the rule that the states would conduct common admission,“ explained the dean of a medical college.
