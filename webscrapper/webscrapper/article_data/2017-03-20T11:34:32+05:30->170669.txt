BHUBANESWAR: The state government is taking steps to adopt a   management bylaw in an effort to manage plastic waste generated in urban local bodies with greater efficiency. 

 Minister for housing and urban development, Pushpendra Singh Deo, spoke of this in the assembly in reply to a written question.
 
 The minister admitted that the government has not rolled out any specific plan exclusively for treatment of plastic and polythene wastes. However, he assured that steps were being taken to separate   soon.
 
 The announcement assumes significance at a time when increasing plastic and polythene waste generated in towns and cities of the state has become a major threat for the environment, causing frequent blockages of drainage systems. 
 
 The latter often triggers   problems in low lying pockets, particularly during rainy season. 
 
 The minister told the House that 112 urban local bodies in the state, including municipal corporations, municipalities and  , generate over 2000 tonnes of waste per day. Of them the   alone generates 336 tonnes of waste per day (TPD) in the state.
