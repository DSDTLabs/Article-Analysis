KOLKATA: The   authorities have written to the Centre alerting it about the “mess” that the museum’s priceless artefacts are in. A revamp plan has also been submitted to the ministry of culture, the guardian of the  . It is being assessed for implementation in the next fiscal.

 The letter details about the ill-maintained store of the museum where more than 90% of the artefacts are stacked without following any modern storage rules. The artefacts face the risk of being destroyed. There are a total of 1,08,000 artefacts in the museum and only 6% of these are on display.
 
 Director of the museum   said, “A lowceilinged underground vault with no proper stacks to scientifically stow the priceless items best describes the store. You can hardly stand upright to inspect the items. Moreover, it lacks proper lighting.”
 
 The store does not have a proper inventory of the items, he rued. “In the absence of a proper inventory and catalogue, it is difficult to trace an item. During the British era, archaeologists and Indologists worked together to bring collectibles to this museum because this was the only repository available. But the museum has not evolved over time,”   rued. The items in the store have not been conserved in all these years. There are no CCTVs in the store to monitor unsolicited movement.
 
 Purohit’s letter to the ministry also details of how a nexus worked between illegal squatters on the museum premises and some ‘insiders’. This results in valuable artefacts being smuggled out of the museum into the markets of  , where foreigners pick these up cheap. “At least 42 squatter families used to live on the premises. We managed get rid of them over the past couple of months,” Purohit said.
