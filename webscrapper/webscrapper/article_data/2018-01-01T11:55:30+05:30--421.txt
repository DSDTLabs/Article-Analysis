Director   said it is important that   "feel pain". Reportedly, Russo, who is co-helming  , has underlined the importance of giving some human-like characteristics to on-screen superheroes in order to make them more relatable.

  
  
 "We love being told good stories, and we love telling good stories, and all of our energy, and our effort, and our thought, and our passion goes into telling the best story that we can. And for us, the best stories have stakes," Russo told.
 
 "Characters have to make sacrifices. To really, really feel the true emotion and the hero's journey they have to go through trials and those trails could cost them something," Russo added. The director feels it is imperative his film's characters experience pain because it helps to make them more inspirational.
 
 "For us, it is very important that the heroes feel pain and that they make sacrifices because I think that, not only is a great storytelling, but it also is inspiring and I think we need a lot of inspiration in this world right now."
 
 "So, for us, I don't know if we can ever get you to accept it, but I promise you this: we'll do our damnedest to tell you the best story possible, and what you do with it from there is up to you," he added.
