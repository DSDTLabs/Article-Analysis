MUMBAI: In an attempt to outsmart the   that has cracked down on illegal hawking across Mumbai, vendors have found a way to hide their wares when civic officials come for inspection.

 In a video that has gone viral,   on   in Vakola can be seen hiding their wares inside storm water drains to evade action. The wares include perishable items like fruits and vegetables. Assistant commissioner Alka Sasane of H-east ward (Bandra east) said they are aware of the video and on Friday morning, action was initiated. “Legal action will be taken by filing first information reports (FIRs) against them, if required,” she said.
 
 The video shows how the hawkers remove the roadside drain covers one officials have left after inspection and remove the goods for sale. Former   corporator from the area Brian Miranda, whose wife   is now the corporator, said that he witnessed the entire incident. 
 
 “People consume these fruits and vegetables and the hawkers store them in the drains. it could lead to people falling ill. They told me they have been sitting on Nehru Road for many years but over the past few days, the BMC has not been allowing them to do so and confiscating their goods. This is affecting their business and therefore, they are resorting to such tactics,” he said.
 
 Following the   stampede on September 29 last year, which claimed the lives of 23 people, the BMC cracked down on hawkers illegally occupying footpaths and area outside railway stations. The BMC has also demarcated a 150m zone near station premises where hawking is not permitted.
