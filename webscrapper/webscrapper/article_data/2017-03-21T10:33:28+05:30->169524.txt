TRICHY: With rapid urbanisation taking toll on the bird population in the city, a group of youths have join hands to bring the chirp back.

 It all started with a social media campaign called ‘Trichy Saranalaya’ through which the group sensitised the public about birds increasingly abandoning the city due to loss of habitat. They requested people to contribute to their cause by donating grains and also by providing food and water to birds.
 
 Soon, donors started reaching out to the group, which has so far collected 80 kg of grains and 35 clay pots.
 
 “We were humbled to find the security guard at   taking up the responsibility to feed birds daily. We got similar response from the staff of  ,” said coordinator of   Saranalaya Arun Prasath.
 
 A resident of   in Trichy, which is among the few areas in the city which still have a green cover, Arun said that birds can now only be spotted in such pockets. 
 
 “We will ensure availability of food and water in these locations,” he said, while urging city residents to provide food and water to birds coming to their homes. 
 
 Meanwhile, experts too have called for conservation of local or native bird species which are grossly neglected over fascination for migratory species. “The bird population has been on rapid decline over the years due to habitat loss especially in the urban areas,” said city-based ecologist Q Ashoka Chakkaravarthy. 
 
 It is human intolerance that has mainly affected local species like crow pheasant, house sparrow, myna, little egret and even owls, which prey on rats, he said. The native birds either die due to lack of food and water or migrate to other parts. 
 
 While appreciating the campaign he said, “Such campaigns will bridge the gap between humans and birds. It will stop birds from migrating,” he said. 
 
 The group organised a meeting on Sunday which was attended by several NGOs from the city, including Thaneer and Seyal.
