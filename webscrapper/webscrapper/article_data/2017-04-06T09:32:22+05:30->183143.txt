PATNA: A week after the BJP state chief   announced the list of the reconstituted   and  , both the list and Rai have come under fire from former state general secretary  

 Talking to a section of media on Wednesday, Sharma alleged that Rai reconstituted the state executive committee and appointed party office-bearers in line with his vengeful designs. “The new committee has been formed under vengeance. He (Rai) has included in the list people who are new. There are some others whose antecedents are not even known,” Sharma said.
 
 He even made personal attack on Rai, pointing out that his background was questionable as he had roots in   and mafia activities, apart from owning ‘arbon rupia (billions of rupees)’.
 
 On the induction of new and lesser known persons in the party’s state executive and its office-bearers, Rai had earlier told TOI that the party had thousands of workers and it was not easy to pick or reject anyone. “Yet, all the names were decided collectively in consultation with the party’s top brass in the state,” Rai maintained.
 
 However, countering Sharma’s allegations, Rai said on Wednesday that no one should consider himself as the only face of the party and only s/he was best suited for it. “For, right from the Jan Sangh, it is the sweat of thousands of leaders that has made the party what it is today,” Rai said.
 
 As to the personal attack made by Sharma on him, Rai said anyone was free to visit his village and house and assess for himself the wealth he had made or owned.
