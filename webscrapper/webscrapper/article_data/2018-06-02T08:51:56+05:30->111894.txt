MUMBAI: If India were looking for 90 minutes of  , then they got it. But if they were looking to test their ability to break open the rival defence, then they did not have much to do as   hardly presented any resistance.

 
 
 
 India ran riot and won 5-0 in their opening game of the Intercontinental Cup at the Mumbai Football Arena on Friday.  , who was playing his 99th international, scored two in the first half and one in the second as India outclassed their insipid opponents.
 
 Udanta Singh scored the third goal making it a Bengaluru FC contribution in terms of goals for India.   smashed one to the roof of the net to make it 5-0. Two goals that broke the Taipei defence came due to the breakdown in the centre and if that happens, then the backline is obviously not doing its job.
 
 Their defence could not understand the interplay between the two veterans, Chhetri and Jeje Lalpekhlua. The first goal was a typical setup from Jeje who provided the bullet for Chhetri, who ran past the defence that did not mark him.
 
 For the second, Anirudh Thapa was also involved as the trio had a series of 10 passes. Though Chhetri was the star of the day and Jeje was quietly playing his role, it was the hard-working Thapa who was the most impressive player in the middle of the park.
 
 Thapa, who was making his first ever start in the playing XI, stitched the defence and the strike force.
