NAVI MUMBAI: Following a blanket   on entry to   waterfalls in Kharghar, weekend revellers have discovered a new hangout zone—Mini-Pandavkada.

 The new monsoon destination, a stone’s throw away from Pandavkada, is situated along the foothills of Parsik Hills. However, questions are being raised about the safety and security of the picnickers at this new spot, located just behind Kharghar golf course near the driving range. 
 
 The local residents have complained that the narrow lanes have been clogged during the weekends as the unruly revellers seem to be unmindful about haphazard parking. Unruly revellers also get drunk and indulge in rash driving. 
 
 With heavy rains lashing the city, the number of picnickers has been rising significantly every passing week. But the authorities are not well prepared to deploy more forces to regulate the movement, citing staff crunch.
 
 The local police station is yet to station its force to keep a tab on the picnickers. However, the traffic unit has kicked off a drive to punish unruly motorists found in drunk and drive. 
 
 “After receiving complaints about drunk driving, we have started a campaign to punish the traffic violators. On Friday, four such cases were reported. Due to lack of manpower, we could not deploy adequate number of personnel,” said traffic inspector Pravin Pande.
 
 According to Suyog Pote, a collegian from Thane, “As the main   are has been shut for picnickers, we are left with no option but to go to the mini waterfalls. So far, we have not seen any security personnel blocking our entry to this new spot.” A local resident,  , said a lot of empty liquor bottles were found along the road and the revellers have been seen driving rashly.
