MAPUSA: Goa Pradesh   Committee ( ) on Wednesday lashed out at the state BJP government over its utter and complete failure to combat   trafficking in the coastal belt of Goa especially in  , Candolim, Vagator, etc. The Congress also alleged that the drug menace is now spreading to South Goa as well.

 Senior Congress leaders like Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, Tivim MLA Nilkanth Halarnkar, former Union law minister Ramakant Khalap, Mapusa block Congress president Vijay Bhike, St Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes and others spoke to mediapersons at GPCC’s   district office at Mapusa on this issue.
 
 Lourenco said that Anjuna, in particular, holds the darkest credentials, with drugs being freely traded and openly consumed at late night parties, but neither dancers nor dealers and customers have ever been medically examined. “Every day from 8pm-5am, some notorious shacks cum night clubs in Anjuna transform into infamous joints for illegal drug trade. These establishments have been raided in the past by the police, yet these activities continue without any fear of the law.” 
 
 “Sound pollution levels are extremely high, but not a single raid has taken place in recent times, as the drug mafia enjoys the patronage of politicians and senior police officials. There are zero checks to measure decibel levels of music played late into the night at shacks and night clubs. It shatters the peace in the area,” he added.
