The motto that governed the life of E Ahamed was development of minority community based on democratic and secular values and this has influenced the new generation of the party greatly.

 The several-decades long political career of E Ahamed as a national leader was inspiring to many . In parliament, for junior members like us, Ahamed sahib was a guiding spirit and mentor who was always considerate. The warmth which he showered on party workers and junior leaders like me during public meetings and conferences has enlivened us much.
 
 He had worked with several veteran leaders such as Seethi Sahib and Pookoya Thangal and used to share with us the things that he learnt from them. He was very sober and democratic and never compromised his secular point of view and values to achieve anything out of way . He gave a new dimension to minority politics in the state by adhering to secular credentials.
 
 He handled three major portfolios as minister of state in centre and brought development to Kerala using his influence as minister. He has always been concerned about NRIs especially from Kerala. Even when appointing ambassadors in countries, especially Arab countries he made sure that they fared well with Malayali expatriates there. His interventions in their problems have always had positive results.He was like a parental figure to them. When he was holding his office as the minister of state for Railways, Kerala had its due share in railway budgets.
