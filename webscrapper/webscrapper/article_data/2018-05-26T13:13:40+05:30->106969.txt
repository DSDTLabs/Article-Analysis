VILLUPURAM: The   district crime   (DCB) officials on Thursday evening booked actor-turned-politician J K Rithesh and his accomplice on charges of duping a youth of lakhs of rupees on the pretext of providing him a government job.

 The complainant, Jeyabalan, 35, of Eraiyanur village in Tindivanam, alleged that the two had demanded Rs 7 lakh from him for providing him a job in the   department. However, they did not keep their word and also threatened him with dire consequences if he asked for returning the money.
 
 According to DCB SI Vasu, Jeyabalan, who had completed his ITI, alleged in the complaint that Kannan, a local bigwig, had offered to help him get a job in the transport department because of his political connections and he fell for the bait. Kannan took him to former MP J K Rithesh to whom he paid Rs 7 lakh in this regard.
 
 The police said the duo received the money in December 2014 and assured Jeyabalan that he would receive the appointment order within the next six months. But nothing happened. 
 
 When Jeyabalan realised that he was cheated by the two, he asked them to return his money. But the duo, in turn, threatened him with dire consequences following which Jeyabalan lodged a complaint with the Villupuram DCB.
 
 Based on the complaint, a case was registered against Rithesh and Kannan.
