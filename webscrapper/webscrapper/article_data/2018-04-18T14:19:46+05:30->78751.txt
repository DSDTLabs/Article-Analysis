PANAJI:   Nitin   has given the green signal to commence desilting work of River   and at a later stage of River Mandovi, said river navigation minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar.

 “The River Sal is totally contaminated. Unless we desilt it, the river cannot be cleaned. Gadkari has said that desiltation of River Mandovi has to be also done immediately. Therefore, we will get the work done with assistance from the Centre,” he said.
 
 For this, Dhavalikar said that at least 1.5 metres of slush will have to removed from either side of River Sal, and three metres from the centre. The first stretch from Verna to   fish market side of the river will be undertaken on priority, he said.
