CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday asked the   government in Punjab to regularise the services of contractual teachers as per the party’s pre-poll promise and not force them to work on a basic pay of Rs 10,300 per month.

  and   said many of these teachers were drawing salaries ranging from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 and had already put in eight to 10 years of service as contractual employees. These include teachers recruited under the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), computer teachers, lab attendants, teachers hired for Adarsh Schools.
 
 He added, “It is shocking that instead of recognising their services to the state and offering them pay protection while regularising their services, the government is asking them to work on a basic pay of Rs 10,300 per month.” The government’s policy was discriminatory and inhumane, he added.
 
 The Akali leaders said 5,178 ‘pendu sehyogi adhyapak’ had been working in rural areas under various kinds of hardships for three years at a consolidated pay of Rs 6,000 per month. “Now when the time has come to regularise their services, the government is reneging from its assurance to induct them as permanent employees,” he said, demanding immediate regularisation of all contractual teachers at the earliest without making proposed drastic cuts in their salaries.
