The   sun is a veritable assault on your   and  . From sun-related rashes to light eruptions to heat rashes to sun-damage – it’s a battleground out there. Here’s your basic starter kit to beat the heat. 

 
 
 A sunscreen is your best bet against sun protection. Don’t cut corners there. Pick a broad spectrum sunblock. Look for words like matte, non-comedogenic, and SPF 30, if not more. 
 Update your face cleanser to one that reduces oil production. Look for glycolic acid, exfoliation and hydration. Stay away from a harsh fragrance.
 Switch to a light hydrator. But if you have oily and acne-prone skin, you can avoid moisturising.
 Get a good facial mist spray and a hydrating and repairing skin night serum.
 When picking summer face masks, go for ones with fuller’s earth, bentonite, tea tree or camomile.
 Stock up on facial wet wipes too. Just remember to pick alcohol-free wipes and a water-based make-up remover.
 
 
 
 Dermatologists say that the only way to avoid sun damage is to avoid the sun – at least prolonged exposure to the sun. Re-apply at least once.
 Choose a mild shampoo. Dry your hair using a cool option on the dryer.
 Cover your head when outdoors with a hat or scarf. Use a hair serum to protect from UV damage.
 De-frizz hair with a light conditioner.

 To cool your skin down, ice is the best home remedy. Wrap it in a clean cloth and apply on your face to calm your skin. Add water-rich fruits and vegetables to your diet. Drink tender coconut and watermelon juice. Use fresh cold aloe vera gel to cool the skin.
 Avoid chemical-based skin treatments in summer, as it can damage the skin upon sun exposure.
