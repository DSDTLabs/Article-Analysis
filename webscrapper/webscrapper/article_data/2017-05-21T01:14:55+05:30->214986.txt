Lucknow: To meet the sewage treatment requirement of the city for next 15 years, Jal Nigam had sought about Rs 400 crore from Centre under the ‘Namami Ganga’ project to build a new STP of 250 MLD near Bharwara but the proposal has been put on the backburner because of ongoing inspection of the   project by state government.

 Under the riverfront project, parallel intercepting trunk drains have to be made on both sides of   to divert all sewage generated in city to Bharwara STP. These drains will run along 15km length on both sides of the river from near IIM Road to Shaheed Path. Smaller drains emerging from different locations of city that have been flowing into Gomti so far would be falling into the intercepting drains once they are ready. These drains are meant to carry sewage flowing from different parts of city through drains to Bharwara STP for treatment, after which the water would be made to flow back to the river’s downstream region. The sewage generated in Lucknow daily is about 750 MLD while the city can presently treat only about 400 MLD sewage through Bharwara and Daulatganj STPs of 345 and 56 MLD capacity, respectively.
 
 In next 15 years, the daily generated sewage is expected to increase to over 1000 MLD, hence Jal Nigam has sought funds for making a new STP at Bharwara of 250 MLD and also a separate STP at GH Canal of 120 MLD. But due to government's probe in the project, the plan is put on hold. Jal Nigam’s official in-charge said, “We had sent the proposal worth about Rs 400 crore long time back to seek approval under Namami Ganga project but the ongoing inspection into expenses incurred I riverfront project has stalled the plans for now.”
 
 Total 37 nullahs emerge from the city along the length of the intercepting drain but only 22 are tapped so far and diverted to the older Bharwara STP for treatment. The new STP will help tap remaining drains too.
