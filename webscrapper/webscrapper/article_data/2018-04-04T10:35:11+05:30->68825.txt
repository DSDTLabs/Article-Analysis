HYDERABAD: A cross-check ordered by acting Chief Justice   on the compensation to be paid to farmers in the two Telugu states for land acquired from them, has revealed huge discrepancies. Leave alone the recent acquisitions, compensation to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore was yet to be paid to farmers of the two states for their land parcels acquired long ago. They were yet to get payouts despite court judgements in their favour.

 The bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K  , it can be recalled, had converted a letter it received from   district judge   as a public interest case.
 
 When the CJ cross-checked the figures he obtained from the HCâ€™s registrar general, it was found that   has dues up to Rs 867 crore and Telangana Rs 900 crore. The bench directed both states to verify the figures obtained by judiciary and furnish fresh dues list within two weeks.
