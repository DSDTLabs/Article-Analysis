PATNA: The   is on July 28 and doctors advise people to take precautions against   A and E viruses during the rainy season. Hepatitis A and E are viral infections caused due to infected water and food or by infected secretion that enters the body after contact. 

 “We get nearly 7-8 patients every day in the OPD. They have the same symptoms, like jaundice. People should use purified water and take proper care about hygiene and sanitation,” said HoD of IGIMS’s department of gastroenterology Dr Amarendra Kumar.
 
 On being asked if fast food could cause the symptoms to develop, Dr Kumar said if clean, that would not cause the infection. He said Hepatitis B virus ( ) and C virus (HCV) are blood borne. 
 
 “Even though the vaccination for HBV and HCV is 95 % successful, we get 10-15 cases each day. HBV can be transmitted through infected blood or various bodily fluids. HCV is transmitted through the infected syringe or blood transfusion,” he said. 
 
 Dr C Khandelwal, a gastroenterological surgeon at a superspecialty city hospital, said the number of HAV and HEV cases increases by 10% during monsoon. “These numbers further increase post monsoon, when there is contaminated water everywhere. In rare cases, acute hepatitis can be severe and results in acute liver failure and pancreatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease as well, which can cause bleeding from the mouth,” he said.
 
 As per Dr  , associate professor of gastroenterology at PMCH, Hepatitis A and E are water and food borne and caused due to contamination through flies, dirty stagnant water and leakage from water pipelines. “Our OPD gets 10 cases each day,” he said. 
 
 Talking about the Hepatitis B and C, he said the number of cases have swollen as compared to before as screening of blood is mandatory for patients who are undergoing any operation or donating blood.
