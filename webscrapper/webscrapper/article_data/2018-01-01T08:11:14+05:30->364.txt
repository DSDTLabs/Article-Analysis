HYDERABAD: From January 1, 2018, about 1,000 more habitations will get enhanced drinking   as part of Rs 45,000-crore Mission  , a flagship project of chief minister  . 

 Now, these villages get between 30 and 40 litres per capita per day (LPCD). In 2018, the supplies would be around 100 LPCD.
 
 Trial runs are being conducted on supply of water till the overhead storage-cum-supply reservoirs in villages. 
 
 These 1,000 habitations are located in the districts of Khammam, Nizamabad, Medak, Karimnagar and parts of Mahbubnagar.
 
 These 1,000 habitations are in addition to the over 4,000 habitations that already get Mission Bhagiratha water.
 
 The trial runs have been going on in all the districts successfully. The main pipelines from the reservoirs have been laid to all the habitations. Only laying of intra pipelines within villages and households and fixing taps need to be done.
 
 Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has categorised the implementation of the project into two parts. 
 
 The first one is to cover at least half of the total habitations by December 31, 2017. The second part involves covering all the habitations by June 2018.
 
 "Work is ahead of schedule at many places. So, we are confident of covering all villages much before the deadline of June 2018," an official said.
 
 Mission Bhagiratha's objective is to provide 100 LPCD to every house in villages, 135 LPCD in municipalities and 150 LPCD in main cities (municipal corporation areas in  ).
