PUDUCHERRY: The   of the Union territory of Puducherry sought the approval of the Union government to pass an appropriate legislation to ensure holding jallikattu without any hurdle. 

 A resolution to this effect, which was moved by chief minister  , was passed in the assembly on Wednesday. Narayanasamy said the Tamil Nadu government passed an ordinance in the assembly to hold jallikattu. Terming jallikattu as one of the traditional sports of Tamil people, Narayanasamy traced its antiquity to the Sangam era. He said he had already written to the Prime Minister   urging the Union government to pass an ordinance to ensure conduct of the traditional Tamil sport. "We will also call on the Prime Minister insisting that he fulfill our demand," he said.
 
 The assembly also passed a resolution urging the Union government to exempt Puducherry from   (Neet) for admission into medical and dental programmes. Narayanasamy, while moving the resolution, said there are seven private medical colleges and one government medical college in Puducherry. He said the centralised admission committee constituted by the government fills up 400 of the total 1,200 MBBS seats under government quota based on the marks secured by the students in the plus two examinations.
 
 He said the students in Puducherry, who follow syllabus of state education boards (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh), will not fare well in Neet, which is based on CBSE syllabus. He said enrolment of rural students in medicine and dental programmes will come down drastically if admission is through Neet. 
 
 Stating that the government has initiated efforts to introduce CBSE pattern in a phased manner, he asked the Union government to exempt Puducherry from the purview of Neet for the next five years as the students will be following different state education boards until then.
