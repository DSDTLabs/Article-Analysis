BHOPAL:   government has suspended the district education officer (DEO) of Satna in connection with Class 9 and 11  . The government has also ordered an inquiry into the matter and filed a police complaint for immediate action against the culprits.

 “We came to know that question papers of Class 9 and 11were out a day before the examination in Satna. We have suspended the district education officer (DEO) of Satna and lodged a case with the local police for further investigation,” school education minister Vijay Shah informed the house on the question paper leak issue, on Friday. 
 
 Shah further stated that police have registered a case in the regard and arrested three persons from Satna, who were allegedly involved in leaking the question paper. The state cyber cell will also conduct an inquiry into the case as to how the paper was circulated in social media, said Shah.
 
 “We have also cancelled all previous examinations of Class 9 and 11 after the paper leak came to light. The examinations will be conducted again and a time table will be declared soon,” Shah told house.
 
 Reacting to school education minister's statement, Congress leader Bala   said that it was surprising that despite all warnings, the government failed to control the paper leak in the state. He said as the minister was giving statement in the house on paper leak, a new development on Class 10th paper echoed the house, which is surprising.
 
 “The government should take this matter seriously. Question papers out before examination create adverse impact on the students specially, those who had been studying throughout the year. But, it seems the government is not serious,” alleged Bachchan in the house.
 
 He further said that talented students were shocked to know that their question paper was leaked before examination. Also, they were unaware of the new exam schedule which put a lot of mental stress on them, Bachchan said.
