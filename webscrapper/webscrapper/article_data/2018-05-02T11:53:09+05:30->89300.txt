SECUNDERABAD: Days after a stretch of road beside St John's Junior   in Marredpally received a facelift by residents and youngsters, it is now adorned with   banners. 

 Locals who participated in repairing the 100-meter stretch, displayed placards which said the stretch has been named 'KTR-Ivanka Trump Road' as a token of protest against the apathy of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation officials.
 
 On Tuesday, around 10am, several youths put up flexis about the new name. They also pasted posters on compound walls of colonies, adjacent to this stretch.
 
 Commuters crossing the stretch, stopped their vehicles and appreciated the youngsters efforts. While others stopped their cars and took pictures of the banners.
 
 "Instead of taking up repair work , the GHMC has turned a blind eye to worries of people. We will wait two weeks for a visit from officials. If they fail to visit and take up repairs, we will take responsibility of laying new roads," said S Srikanth, a resident. 
 
 When TOI contacted GHMC executive engineer, (Begmupet Circle), A Suresh, he said, "GHMC has invited tenders to take up various road repair work in Secunderabad and this stretch is one among them. In two weeks, tenders will be finalised and works will be taken up," he added. A GHMC official said by the first week of June all work will be completed.
