NEW DELHI: Buoyed by an “impressive” response to its announcement to waive property tax, the   has decided to mark Saturday as “House Tax Mukti Diwas” in all the 272 wards going to polls. 

 On Friday, members of several RWAs came together to burn house tax bills in support of the proposed move. The party’s Delhi unit convener,  , said people were confident that the move would protect them from “malicious and corrupt officers of corporations who assess house tax and seek bribe for settling payments”. 
 
  will need to amend DMC Act, 1957, to come good on its promise. The party has said that it is ready to effect necessary amendments to the Act in the Delhi assembly where AAP has a thumping majority. 
 
 Some experts, however, said the waiver of house tax, which is one of the key sources of income for the municipal bodies, can cripple them financially. AAP has countered that argument by saying that the move will check corruption. 
 
 The party claims that its proposal has been met with enthusiasm by people. “In some areas, people are burning house tax bills in anticipation of AAP’s victory,” party functionary   said.
