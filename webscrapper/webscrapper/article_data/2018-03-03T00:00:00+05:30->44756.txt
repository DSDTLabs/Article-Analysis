Classical and contemporary violinist   is presently working on his album, Two Sides Of Karma, along with his band IndoSoul. The first song from the album, Kuyilai Polave, was released recently, grasping the attention of several music lovers. And this love song is supposed to be a first-ever for the musician. 

 Karthick says, “We wanted to release the song on Valentine’s Day, but we ended up shooting the song on that day. I had written this song a while ago for my wife  , who is also a dancer. Later, I was thinking of developing this into a music video. I also got   on board for this number, and she has danced for it. The song explores the simple joys of relationship that starts with two people uniting and leading a life together without precedence. We had an arranged marriage. The strong thread of attraction between us has journeyed from seeing hesitant conversations and awkward silences and blossomed into something much deeper, and beautiful. This goes to all the men and women, reminiscing about their relationships.”
 
 The vocals, violin and lyrics are by Karthick, while   is on guitar,   is on percussion, and Ramkumar Kanakarajan is on drums.   has handled the bass, while Ranjini Ramesh has directed and edited the video.   adds, “There are seven songs in the album. We are crowd-sourcing and have plans to release it in July. And yes, we are looking at doing a video for all the songs.”
