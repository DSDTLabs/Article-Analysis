BENGALURU: While people thronged the   on Saturday, more than 1,000 people braved the scorching sun and stood on the bund surrounding the airbase just to get a glimpse of the aerial displays.

 Neelavathi and her daughter, Revathi came by with others in their family. “The aircraft make so much noise and it feels they will come crashing down on us. They’re so big; it’s exciting to watch them. We’ve been standing here for an hour. This is like elevated platform so we like watching it from here,” said Neelavathi.
 
 While people travelled from afar to witness the spectacle, the show is old hat for residents of surrounding villages. Some have come from nearby villages to Sugatta to get onto a terrace or water tank. Several terraces have been converted into makeshift viewing areas with a cloth cover.
 
 This is the tenth aero show for Sidanna, a 65-year-old farmer in the village. “I’ve even worked at the airport and got a chance to see these aircraft up close. Only youngsters find it thrilling. Many young people come to see it. Earlier, there used to be only farmland here but now it’s over-run with planes. People start coming from the first day and camp here all day,” he said.
 
 Sridhar, Sudarshan and Bharadwaj, all primary school students from a government school in the vicinity, stopped to stare at helicopters whirring by. “I love the planes which emit coloured smoke. It looks so beautiful. The helicopters are my favourite,” said Bharadwaj, a class 2 student. Sudarshan figured that the best view was to be had from the terrrace of the boys’ hostel.
 
 Along one end of the bund, around 80 boys and girls had come from a government school in Devanahalli. "We took the half-day off and brought the kids here. We felt they should also experience this spectacle. The students are from classes 1 to 8,” said their teacher Sujatha.
 
 Once in two years, the neighbouring villages put up with the noise and dust. But nobody’s really complaining.
