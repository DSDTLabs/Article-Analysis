CHENNAI: In the recent case of two women raped in two consecutive days at knifepoint in the city, the police's attempt to lift footage from three CCTV cameras near the scene of the crime to identify the rapist, failed to yield results due to technical glitches, investigating officers said. The JJ Nagar police have acquired the innerwear of the rapist which he left behind at one of the victim's homes. 

 
  Investigators said 25-year-old Usha*, a junior software analyst, on Tuesday morning lodged a complaint with the JJ Nagar police, stating that a stranger had raped her earlier that day. The police picked up a suspect, who lives in the same locality, after Usha's neighbour, Kausalya*, 30, said the man had sexually assaulted her in similar circumstances 24 hours earlier. 
 
  Kausalya identified her neighbour, the man the police have detained, as the rapist. However, Usha told investigators that the suspect was not the man who had assaulted her. 
 
  Police said that the CCTVs close to the women's homes were not working. "An identification parade was done, but there was no breakthrough in the case so far," said an investigating officer. "We are checking the location of the man who is currently in our custody."
