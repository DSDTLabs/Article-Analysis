MYSURU: A burglar who broke into   decamped with cash from the hundi. 

 Interestingly, the donation box was full with offerings, but the burglar took just around Rs 6,000, said police sources
 
 Police said the burglar managed to enter the temple on   by cutting open the iron grills of a window in the wee hours of Saturday.
 
 After gaining entry, the burglar broke open the steel lid of the hundi and fled with cash. The incident came to light when the temple priest   opened the temple doors on Saturday morning. He immediately informed KR Police.
 
  Police said the hundi was supposed to be opened next week for audit. Meanwhile, police could not recover the footages recorded in the CCTVs as they were disconnected due to renovation work. 
 
 Police are puzzled as the burglar left behind the remaining cash and jewellery in the donation box.
