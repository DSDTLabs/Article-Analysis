PATIALA: Former Punjab finance minister   of   (SAD) has rubbished allegations of local government minister   that the Akali government had misused central grants. He said SAD was ready for a debate on the issue inside or even outside the state assembly.

 Dhindsa, who was here on Friday to hold a meeting with party workers for restructuring SAD local units, said instead of playing the blame game, the ruling Congress should come out with its two-month report card and tell the people whether it had delivered what it had promised. 
 
 Sidhu had, on Monday, accused former chief minister   and his son   of siphoning off over Rs 2,000 crore under Smart City project and Amrut scheme. He had alleged that the Badals had “put the money into their accounts.” Sidhu had also claimed that the centre had now withheld the funds as these were “misused” by the previous SAD-BJP government.
 
 However, Dhindsa said Sidhu’s accusations were baseless.“All developmental funds were utilised in a transparent manner and the party had nothing to hide from public scrutiny,” he said. He claimed SAD would substantiate their claim as and when Sidhu decides on a debate.
