CHARMINAR: Architectural grandeurs known as sarais or rest houses that were built during the   era lie in dilapidated conditions in the city. 

 The structures which were constructed to cater to the needs of travellers to the city have been reduced to nothing, with many people finding it tough to even identify the monuments. 
 
 For instance, the Nampally sarai, situated near Hyderabad (deccan) railway station is the biggest among other rest houses in the city but nobody, not even those residing in the surrounding areas seem to be aware of its existence.
 
 The Nampally sarai, constructed in the year 1919, during the era of Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan also seems to have developed cracks on its structure.
 
 "I have been living here for the past two years and I had no idea that there is a Sarai here. The government should do something to restore it and see that it is not neglected," said  , a resident of Nampally.
 
 Similarly, an A listed heritage structure, the   sarai, located on the   road suffers a similar same fate.The 60-odd rooms within it have turned into mechanic workshops, garment stores and other such small business outlets.
 
 Anuradha Reddy, co-convener of Intach, said, "The Sarais in the city need immediate attention and need to be restored to their past glory. Earlier, people who travel from faraway places used to stay at these rest houses for the night. The stay at the rest house was free of cost." 
 
 However, the  's Director  , said, "There are no plans of repairing the structure as of now but we will definitely look into it."
 
 While the Nampally and Aliabad sarai rest houses belong to the   era, there are others dating back to the Qutub Shahi period. 
 
 The Puranpul Sarai located near Mian Mishk mosque and a rest house at   were gradually converted into a commercial market with shops coming up in the rooms.
