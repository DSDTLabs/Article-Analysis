Thane: Every tree burnt in a forest fire destroys a huge chunk of the ecosystem, claim environmentalists and activists referring to a series of forest fires that has reduced over five hectares of Yeoor range to  . While the forest department has valued the gutted forest area according to Rs 500 per hectare rate determined by the estimated cost of the timber lost, the green warriors claim that each inch of the green zone has a wealth of biodiversity living in it and needs to be valued accordingly.

 “Each tree in the forest plays a host to a variety of insects, reptiles, mammals and much more. In addition to harming this fauna, the burning down of one tree in the forest completely destroys their habitat and displaces them. If this is the impact of one tree burning, imagine the effect on the ecosystem and the biodiversity if acres of trees face the same end,” said  , a city-based activist.
 
 “This year, over five hectares of forest land was burnt down, which on paper amounts to a loss of a little over Rs 2,500. Officials need to make another estimate considering the loss of biodiversity so that citizens, especially those frequenting the forest, take the necessary precautions,” said an activist.
 
 In addition to the loss of biodiversity, locals point out that the forest fires also have a direct impact on the heat and pollution levels in the city. The forest fire in Pachpakhadi on Monday resulted in the temperature rising up to 41 degrees Celsius. 
 
 “I can sense a forest fire without going to my window, as the temperature suddenly increases. These fires are puncturing holes in the only oxygen providing green lungs in the MMR,” said  , a   resident.
