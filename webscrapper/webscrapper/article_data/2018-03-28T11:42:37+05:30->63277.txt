SALIGAO: Several households in Gauravaddo,  , were plunged into darkness on Monday after an electricity transformer caught fire. The impact was such that the electricity transformer was entirely gutted and a loud blast was heard due to the fire incident. No one was injured in the fire. The estimated loss is around Rs 3 lakh.

 The incident came to light at around 8.30pm on Monday after some local residents heard a loud blast and spotted a fire at the transformer. Residents then immediately informed the Calangute electricity department about the incident. Assistant engineer, electricity department,   told TOI that the incident occurred due to a short circuit.
 
 “There was a spark in one of the FRB boxes which resulted in the fire. After we were alerted about the incident, we contacted the Mapusa fire service station,”   said. “The fire service officials later doused the fire,” he added.
 
 Linemen from the Calangute electricity department were deputed at the site, who tried to rectify the fault along with the junior engineer (electrical). Electricity supply was restored at 2.25pm on Tuesday. 
 
 “The junior engineer should conduct visual periodical checks to see if any branches of trees are touching the main overhead wires, or if the transformer needs regular maintenance, and a report should be submitted to the assistant engineer to carry out maintenance,” a resident, Domnic D’Souza, said.
