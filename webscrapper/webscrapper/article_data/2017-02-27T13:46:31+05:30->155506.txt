As affairs were drawing to a close at the 89th Annual Academy Awards, the eventful show witnessed one of the biggest bloopers in Oscar history.

 Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, the lead pair from the 1967 film - ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ made their way to present the Best Picture award, and ended up announcing the wrong film as the winner. Dunaway declared that ‘La La Land’ has won the top honour, but as the team of the film stepped on stage to receive the award, it was hurriedly announced that it wasn’t ‘La La Land’ but ‘Moonlight’ that was the best film of the year.
 
 Warren and Jimmy joked for a bit, and the former even offered a clarification. The goof-up transpired reactions from all over, including B-town celebrities, here are some of them.
