Nashik:   in the city will be constructed while the existing ones will be repaired or renovated by   on   (BOT) basis.

 The civic body has invited expression of interest (EOI) from private firms for construction, operation, maintenance of modern public toilets or reconstruction, renovation or repair of the toilets on BOT basis in lieu of limited rights for advertisement and/or erection of mobile communication towers within the   (NMC) limits.
 
 “The existing toilets are in bad shape. It needs to be repaired and maintained. This is a tourist place. Hence, toilets need to be kept clean and hygienic. A private agency should manage to do it well,” said  , a sales executive.
 
 Sharad Jadhav, a trader, said many shops in the Old City area did not have toilets and depend on public toilets. “Under such circumstances public toilets need to be maintained well,” Jadhav said.
 
 Reshma Tandale, a vegetable vendor, said public toilets in the city were in pathetic condition and women in particular face a lot of problems.
 
 “We do not feel like using public toilets. How will the tourists coming from other places feel like using them? The Prime Minister wants to do away with open defecation, but it is of no use unless all toilets are well-maintained and clean,” she said.
 
 “There are 322 existing public toilets which will be maintained, repaired, renovated by the agency and 139 new public toilet units will be constructed,” said an NMC official.
