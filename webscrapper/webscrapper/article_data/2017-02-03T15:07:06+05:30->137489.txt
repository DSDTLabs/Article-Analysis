ARA: Prohibition has helped improve conjugal life as many husbands, who were a  , have now shunned boozing for fear of arrest and become dearer to their spouses.

 This was stated by CM   during his ‘Nischay Yatra’ to Bhojpur district recently. He said some alcoholics were so ardent lovers of Bacchus (God of wine) that Cupid’s arrows failed to create any impact on them. “Post prohibition, however, their persona has changed dramatically, much to the relief of their haried wives,” said the CM at Salakhuan village.
 
 Visibly buoyed by impressive turnout of women at his meeting, the CM said, “Bhojpur is the 33rd district I am visiting as part of ‘Nischay Yatra’. Interacting with women at many places, I came across women who told me, “Pehle mere pati bahut krurr lagte thein, lekin aab unka chehra sundar lagta hai (my husband looked cruel when he used to drink, but they look handsome now that they have stopped drinking),” the CM said, evoking laughter from the thousands of villagers who had gathered to listen to him.
