ROHTAK: At a time when   have restarted their  , famed  , whose role was essayed by   in blockbuster  , has voiced his concern against caste-based reservation in jobs and educational institutes and sought quota for the needy only on economic basis.

 Phogat, who hails from Balali village of Charkhi Dadri district, shot to limelight after his elder daughter Geeta Phogat won a gold medal in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi despite facing societal pressure for breaking stereotypes in the male-dominated contact sport.
 
 “My first choice is that reservation should be abolished once and for all. It should be given to needy and poor who have to struggle for two square meals a day. Political parties have been pushing it for vote bank politics and it has become a contentious issue,” said Phogat, whose other three daughters are also into wrestling.
 
 Quoting his own example, Phogat said he had raised his daughters despite fund and resource crunch and today he has everything by the dint of his hard work and perseverance. “If I start asking for reservation when I have everything at my disposal, it will be wrong. A person in my village who lacks basic amenities should deserve it more than me,” said Phogat.
 
 Phogat said he had also visited the Jat dharna site in Charkhi Dadri on Tuesday because there were needy economically-backward people in the community. “If tomorrow, Brahmins or other castes demand reservation, I will support them as there are needy people in every caste and community,” he said.
 
 He said his daughters Geeta and Babita, both international wrestlers, also shared the same thought about the reservation system.
