KOLKATA: The   have said the initial findings of the   into the alleged   at   of 62-year-old   has found the complaint against the victim was “frivolous” but the questioning, per se, did not lead to his death on Sunday. The police, though, has refused to admit Dey was in their custody as he was “not arrested”.

 Legal experts had said there were two major deficiencies noticed in to how the cops handled the case — a notice was not served to Dey asking him to come to the police station and two, his medical condition was not kept in mind given he had spent a considerable part of last year in bed.
 
 “We went through the CCTV footages but did not find anything that was threatening to the victim. The woman officer too said she had put up only a few simple questions,” said a top Lalbazar officer. Legal hawks, though, wondered how footages can establish the exact language the woman sub-inspector used against Dey. 
 
 Dey’s family members did not lodge any formal complaint either at Sinthi police station or Lalbazar. 
 
 The family members alleged the police were told he was suffering from heart diseases but even then, the cops interrogated him. He couldn’t take the pressure of the questions thrown at him during the quizzing and died due to cardiac arrest, they claimed.
 
 A police officer said the complainant will also be questioned and legal steps would be taken against her if the allegations are found to be false. The police have also started collecting footages of surveillance cameras in the beauty parlour to find whether the victim had really gone there.
