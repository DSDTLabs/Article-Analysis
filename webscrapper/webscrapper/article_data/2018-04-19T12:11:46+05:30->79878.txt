 Acharya’s   was supposed to release on 
 , but had to be pushed back. The teaser of the film is finally out and looks like the film too will finally see the light of the day. The movie revolves around a family crisis and how everyone reacts to it. Suvra, an aspiring specialist in Teleportation, an emerging technology, returns to Kolkata from the US to look after his ailing father. But with time, more challenges come in the way of the family and the film depicts conflicts, crisis and clash of philosophies. The film faced many hurdles and Indrasis had once told us, “My film was sent long back and the censor board suggested six cuts. Things have not moved much since then. Every time, I sent them a letter seeking permission for sending my film to the revising committee, I would be told that the language of the letter is ‘incorrect’. Finally, they said, nothing will happen before 
 . It’s because of the censor board I couldn’t send my film to the National Film Awards,” rued the director. Apparently, the board members raised questions regarding the portrayal of a certain death in the film.
