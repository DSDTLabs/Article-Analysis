A senior HRD ministry official said complaints had been received at the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) regarding books published by CBSE. For example, the online grievance redress system received complaints on a Class XII textbook -- Informatics Practices --which highlighted errors in the content. While majority of the textbooks used by CBSE-affiliated schools are from  , there are some like ‘Interact in English Literature’ for Class IX, Main Course Book for Class X or Workbook for Class X and many textbooks for vocational courses are published by the Board.
 
 According to sources, the ministry has raised concern over the fact as to why an examination conducting body is publishing textbooks when NCERT is already there. “The mandate of CBSE is to conduct examinations and affiliate schools. For textbooks, there is already NCERT which has been entrusted with the task of working on the curriculum and publication of textbooks,” said a senior official.
