KOLKATA: Blaming the   for inciting communal strife, chief minister   on Monday said political leaders should unite people and not divide them. 

 “It is Delhi that divides people, not us. To unite people instead of dividing them, Delhi will have to go along with the state and not the other way around,” she said. 
 
 In a reference to incidents in Baduria and Basirhat,   told a public meeting along NH-41: “They (BJP) have converted   into fake book to foment communal riots in Bengal for political gain. Recently, they circulated a video of an incident in Kumillah, Bangladesh, and a clipping from a Bhojpuri film to create divisions among people in this state. A BJP leader from Hyderabad posted on social media why Bengal should not be turned into another Godhra. They must remember this is not a place where hatred and violence prevail. I won’t tolerate such things in this state. They have no principles except sparking fire in society. Save India from this disaster. It is not the government’s job to incite violence. Far from it, we unite people across religion, caste and creed.”
 
 The CM added, “Recently, a video clip reached me showing a BJP MLA imparting training women in the use of guns. It is being done by the  , a frontal wing of the BJP.” She then questioned, “How do you (BJP) impart training in guns? This is the job of the Army and the administration. Who are you? You cannot do this. A party and its frontal organizations are different from the government. My challenge to the Centre is you have no right to do this.”
 
 Mamata said, “There is no point attacking me. Under the pretext of saving cows, they are trying to foment communal trouble. Don’t fall into their trap. Always remember, wherever they are going, their aim is to ignite strife.”
