NEW DELHI: The gross violation of   by taxi drivers in the capital has again reared its ugly head. The latest incident — where the driver of a kaali-peeli taxi allegedly offered a lift to the woman before assaulting her — highlights how vehicles are often illegally used as shared cabs. 

 The practice of operating shared taxis is common around railway stations. The taxi in question didn’t have a GPS-based fare meter. The transport department had made this mandatory some time ago, but has faced stiff resistance from autorickshaw and taxi unions.
 
 There are 7,224 black-and-yellow cabs registered with the state transport authority. Like autos, these taxis are fitted with GPS, and a public service vehicle badge is mandatory for drivers. Much like three-wheelers, GPS data from these vehicles are captured and maintained by DIMTS on behalf of the transport department.
 
 However, lack of enforcement has meant that most taxis violate rules with impunity. Permits are seldom cancelled or vehicles impounded. In fact, there has been a proliferation of taxis on capital roads over the past few years.
 
 In 2010, the number of taxis – including app-based cabs -- in the capital stood at 57,958. This number went up further to 70,335 in 2012-13. In 2013-14, Delhi had 78,686 registered taxis, according to the Delhi Statistical Handbook 2014.
 
 Interestingly, transport department's data show only 50,000 taxis registered with it.
 
 To operate a taxi, the vehicle owner needs to first get a commercial licence apart from a special permit to ferry passengers. Multiple safety requirements like speed governors and medical kit have to be adhered to. However, these norms are openly flouted.
 
 Traffic police officers admit that apart from booking drivers for permit violations, nothing much can be done. “taxi owners pay the fine in court and are let off with a warning,” said an officer.
