AHMEDABAD: A 72-year-old   has filed a complaint with   for cheating of Rs 1.3 lakh. According to his complaint, two   hoodwinked him to get hold of his   and knew his PIN to withdraw a total of Rs 1.3 lakh from his bank account between February 9 and 12. Police have approached the bank to get CCTV footage of the said ATM.

 According to investigators, Khempal Ramchandani, 72, a resident of Sambandh Bungalow, Thaltej, had a debit card of State Bank of India (SBI). On February 9, he had been to an SBI ATM near Gurudwara on SG Road and had withdrawn Rs 7,000. At that time, two men were standing near the ATM who asked him to re-insert his card due to a glitch and in the process got to know his PIN. While Ramchandani was counting the notes, the duo allegedly swapped the card and gave him another one.
 
 “The incident came to light when he went to another bank’s ATM to withdraw money with his son on February 13 near Thaltej. As the PIN was rejected multiple times, his son checked the card and found that it was issued in the name of one Savita Devi. They immediately approached the bank when they found that between February 9 and 12, the fraudsters had withdrawn Rs 1.3 lakh using his card,” said an investigator.
