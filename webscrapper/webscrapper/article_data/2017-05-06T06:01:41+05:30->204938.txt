MANALI:   on the   highway has been severely affected due to a blockade caused by an avalanche and a landslide near   The highway has been blocked at Rahni Nullah and near   since Thursday evening. 

 Officials said it might take one or two more days for the traffic to return to normalcy. 
 
 Peaks close to Rohtang are covered with thick layers of snow and ice. The region has experienced fresh snowfall in the last few days. Sliding snow and ice from the peak formed an avalanche and blocked the highway completely at Rahni Nullah. This is the most dangerous area on Manali-Rohtang highway, where over 50ft of snow accumulates in winter. 
 
 Border Roads Organization (BRO) has pressed its machinery into service at both the places to clear the road. Officer in-charge BROâ€™s 70 Road Construction Company,   on Friday said that the landslide would be cleared by the evening, but clearing the avalanche-hit road would take a little more time. 
 
 Jain said a steep stretch of about 3km before Beas Nullah, which is completely rocky and unstable, has again started to slide downwards. A landslide had earlier blocked the road here on April 24. 
 
 About a 40km stretch between Gulaba and Koksar is very prone to landslides. The region experiences dozens of landslides and avalanches every year. The area near Rahni nullah is sinking slowly. BRO had sought help from Geological Survey of India (GSI) to solve the mess but to no avail. The road is vulnerable and driving here is tough.
