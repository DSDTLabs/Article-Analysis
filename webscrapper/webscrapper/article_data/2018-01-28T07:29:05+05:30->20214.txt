AHMEDABAD: Multiplexes and cinema halls in   that were looking forward to release of the movie, Padmaavat, are a disappointed lot. Their association’s decision not to screen the movie in Gujarat has dented their earning. 

 Further, footfalls at malls and cinema halls in the city have also gone down signficiantly largely because of the series of attacks on different malls and multiplexes across Ahmedabad. Estimates by   ( ) suggest that multiplexes alone have suffered revenue losses of around Rs 20 crore this weekend.
 
 Giving more details, GMA president   said, “A blockbuster film of the likes of ‘Padmaavat’ or ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’ usually boost revenue, especially over a long weekend. At such a time, when the film’s release is stalled, multiplexes losses rise to 40%.”
 
 Sources in the GMA said that a rough calculation indicates that a multiplex makes anywhere between Rs 18 lakh and Rs 35 lakh over the weekend when a big-budget film is released. This huge earning is lost to multiplex owners.
 
 Estimates by single screen theatres also suggest significant losses. “There are some 125 single screen theatres across Gujarat and they suffered an approximate loss of Rs 6.25 crore in the first weekend if a big-budget film doesn’t get released,” said Rashmikant Bhalodia, president, Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association of Gujarat.
 
 Furthermore, multiplexes are also losing revenue as customers have chosen to stay away from multiplexes over the long weekend. “Not a single new film has released this weekend and, therefore, the audiences in multiplexes have shrunk to some 60-70%,” said  , vice-president, Ahmedabad One Mall. 
 
 “While the footfalls haven’t gone down, they’re about average and not as expected over such holidays and long weekends. We hope it gets better,” said Aditya Shah, CFO, Gulmohar  .
 
 “There is a significant decline in footfalls owing to the recent attacks and the number of walk-ins have also come down by some 50%,” said  , manager, Himalaya Mall.
