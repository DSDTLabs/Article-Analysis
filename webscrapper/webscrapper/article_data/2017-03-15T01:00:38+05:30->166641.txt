GAYA: Holi revellers of Gaya are known for their adventurous fun making, and former minister Ramashray Prasad Singh, when he was a young man, lost one eye after being hit by an unguided ‘missile’ thrown by the revellers in Gaya in 1960. However, never before Holi was so sombre in Gaya as on Monday.   Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce’s former president Anup Kedia and municipal councillor Lalji Prasad attributed the sobriety to the positive impact of prohibition. Even the few who might have managed to get hold of liquor bottles for the occasion, kept it strictly private and dared not make any public scene, said Kedia.    According to Prof Arun Kumar Prasad of M G College-Gaya, people have also come to realise the harm caused by mud and chemical colour powders. Education and spread of knowledge through mass communication channels has played a key role in adding sobriety to the celebrations earlier known for no-holds-barred revelry, said Prasad.    “Of course prohibition has played a very important role, but there were other factors too at work,” the professor said.    Claiming that the festival passed off peacefully, Gaya DM Kumar Ravi said prohibition was an important reason behind this. Moreover, the administrative officials organised local-level Peace Committee meetings to promote harmony, he said.    The administrative machinery continues to remain alert and on action mode as the district has a history of post- festival trouble, the DM added.
