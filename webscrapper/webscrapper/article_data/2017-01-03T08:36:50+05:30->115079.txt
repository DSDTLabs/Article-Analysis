NEW DELHI: A   panel is learnt to have absolved former chief minister   of scripting the attack on party's Haryana unit chief   in the fracas outside Bhairon Mandir on October 6. Former Union minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has concluded that the violence against Tanwar was not "pre-meditated".

 Tanwar was hospitalised with head injuries when supporters of Hooda rained lathi blows on him as they stood part of a crowd to welcome  's "Deoria to Delhi" yatra.
 
 Partymen had called it a clash between rival factions led by Tanwar and his bÃªte noire Hooda who does not want him to head the state unit. The former CM's security officer was also involved in the at tack on Tanwar.
 
 The confrontation cast a shadow over the last day of Rahul's 26-day UP yatra. Barely two hours later, Rahul hogged headlines with his "khoon ki dalali" remark to accuse PM Narendra Modi of trying to make political capital of surgical strikes against Pakistan.
 
 To observers, it marks a victory of sorts for the former CM who remains implacably opposed to all inhouse aspirants in the state.This is the second time Hooda has evaded action.
