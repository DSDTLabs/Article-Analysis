BENGALURU: July is over but   is far from completion. Given the tardy pace at which the TenderSURE project is being executed, it's likely to miss the August deadline set by the  . With the civic agency now expecting the work to finish only by September, traders and residents will have to put up with the mess for another two months. The project began on Feb ruary 22 and was expected to be over in six months. During a spot inspection in May, Bengaluru development minister   had taken officials to task, directing them to expedite the work to ensure the street wears a new look by August. However, a reality check by TOI by Monday revealed that digging and pipe-laying work remained incomplete at many places.

 BBMP officials say the project will be completed by September. “We faced two challenges -nature of the work and the road itself. TenderSURE work is complex because it requires the coordination of multiple agencies.But the bigger problem was the street itself. Sewage from all commercial buildings was being let into the open drain instead of BWSSB sewers and in turn, flowing into the stormwater drain (SWD). Old water pipes were leaking. The whole area was slushy when we started to dig. We first closed the sewers and built new sewage lines. Then we turned our focus to the SWD.By Tuesday , we should be able to lay the water pipes,“ said M Lokesh, executive engineer, BBMP, who's associated with the project.
 
 The   encountered another problem at the junction of  . “We discovered an SWD and work at the junction had to be done from scratch. Laying of the road and footpaths should be over by early Sep tember,“ he added.
 
 As per BBMP's renovation plan, the street spanning over 700 metres will get a uniform roadway (5.5 metre wide) and pedestrian walkways (2.5-4 metre wide). It will have parking space for 32 four-wheelers and 103 twowheelers.   will also have access to amenities like LED lamps.
