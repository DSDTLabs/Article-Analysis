PATNA: The   division of East Central   (ECR) has chalked out a comprehensive plan to further improve safety at the manned and unmanned crossing gates in the division in the wake of dense fog. The move is aimed at preventing accidents on the tracks due to low visibility.

 Of the 328 crossing gates falling under the division, sources said, 80-odd are unmanned.
 
 According to Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Ranjan Prakash  , the division is strictly following the winter safety measures at all the railway crossing gates. The gatemen have been directed to remain vigilant, he said and added laxity on the part of gatemen would be dealt with strictly.
 
 Thakur also expressed concern over the “emergence” of illegal railway crossings on the Patna-Gaya (PG) section of the division. Of the 60 and odd illegal crossings created on the stretch by vested interests, at least 27 are at located at crucial points and brazenly violate railway safety rules, he said.
 
 The Danapur rail administration recently wrote to the district administrations of Gaya,  , Lakhisarai, Seikhpura , Nawada and Patna to help the railways remove the illegal crossings located on the PG and other sections of the division. The letter also wondered how many illegal crossings were built with the MLAs’ official funds.
 
 The DRM has also issued show-cause notices to the railway engineers concerned, asking them to explain what action did they take to prevent the creation of these illegal crossings.
 
 While Patna district has 13 illegal crossing gates, Jehanabad district has 14, Gaya has 21, Nawada has 20 , Nalanda has 10 and Seikhpura has two illegal railway crossing gates.
 
 Meanwhile, the railways is making all possible efforts to streamline the running of long-distance mail and express trains either originating from the division or passing through   in foggy weather conditions, sources said.
