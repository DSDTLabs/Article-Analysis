NEW DELHI: AAP hit out against   on Wednesday, accusing it of using “nationalistic jingoism for psychological manipulation”. The charge came in reaction to a video of BJP Delhi chief   that surfaced on Tuesday where he could be heard talking about his interaction with people in line outside an ATM. Tourism minister   also wrote a letter to Tiwari, saying that singing a patriotic song to harassed people was “unbecoming of him, painful and unacceptable”.

 AAP spokesperson and MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj said each time BJP found itself in a corner, it would resort to the use of nationalism. “This is a strategy that is used frequently by them. When people were standing in queues due to demonetisation, it invoked soldiers in Siachen. Tiwari did the same thing when he sang to people standing in line for the ATM,” said Bharadwaj. “BJP has made a business out of peddling nationalism. They have misused it so much that in some years, people will refuse to believe anything that is genuinely for national good,” he added.
 
 In his letter addressed to Tiwari, Mishra said: “I saw your video in which you are making fun of those standing in line outside ATMs due to demonetisation. You are also saying that it is very easy to fool people in the name of nationalism. The fact that you realise that you are in the wrong becomes clear when you see the person making that video and ask him not to show the video to anyone. The entire top brass of Delhi BJP is sitting with you and shamelessly laughing at your joke,” he said.
 
 The letter goes on to ask Tiwari and all those who were sitting with him, including leader of opposition  , to issue a public apology.
