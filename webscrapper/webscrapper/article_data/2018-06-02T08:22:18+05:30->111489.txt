KOCHI: In a bizarre incident, a two-day-old baby girl was abandoned on the premises of St George’s Forane Church, Edappally, late Friday evening by a couple, presumably the infant’s parents. The baby was first found by the church’s security people around 8:30pm, abandoned close to a pillar. The church authorities immediately alerted   police who rushed the baby to nearby MAJ Hospital. 

 
 Hospital sources told ToI that the baby was healthy “but has some breathing problems’’. According to the paediatrician of the hospital the baby is not more than three days old. “She is weak and we are giving her a drip,’’ MAJ sources said.
 
 Police said they are looking for a couple who had walked into the church premises around 8:15pm with the baby. “The baby was wrapped in an orange sheet. The couple had another child with them. We don’t know why they decided to abandon the baby,’’ Kalamassery CI S Jayakrishnan said.
 
 A case has been charged under sections IPC 317 and juvenile justice (JJ) act 75, police said. Investigating officers have collected   footage from the church. The video, in possession of ToI, shows the couple walking in with the baby.
 
 The woman in dark colour churidhar is seen carrying the baby. The man dressed in blue denims and light green shirt has a bag over his shoulder. The couple is seen discussing where to `dump’ the baby. It is the woman who directs the man to a pandal nearby where shops were set up for the recent church festival.
 
 The second video shows the man walking into a vacant area. He looks around before placing the infant behind a pillar. “There were few cardboard sheets in front covering the baby. But luckily our security found her,’’ church officials said.
 
 The man plants a soft kiss on the baby’s forehead before placing it carefully on the ground. “It is a heart rending scene. They could have approached us for any assistance,” officials said. Police said they have alerted the Child Welfare Committee about the incident.
