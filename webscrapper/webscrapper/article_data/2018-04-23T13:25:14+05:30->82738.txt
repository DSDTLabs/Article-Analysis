GUNTUR/VISAKHAPATNAM: TDP legislator from Hindupur and actor Nandamuri   on Sunday defended his comments against Prime Minister  , saying his remarks were only a reflection of anguish of the people of AP. He further said he did not make any derogatory comments against the PM during his address to the crowd at chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu's 12-hour dharma porata deeksha two days ago. 

 Addressing the media at Chilakaluripet town, Balayya blamed the   leaders for making his public address a big issue rather than the injustice done by the Centre to the state. "I have not used unparliamentary language against the Prime Minister. I can speak Hindi fluently, so there is no chance of going wrong with my words," he said, adding that he had only detailed the agony and anguish of the people about the way the BJP leadership ditched AP.
 
 He said that it was unfortunate that BJP leaders have lodged criminal complaints against him for speaking in the interests of AP. "I am not worried about complaints and cases. I am committed to the cause of AP and only expressed the anguish of the people," he said. 
 
 The popular actor further said he has no intention either to defame the PM or use filthy language against him, and alleged that vested interests were deliberately circulating some morphed videos with a conspiracy against him and the TDP. He demanded that BJP should explain if they are working for the interests of AP or against it.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP Gajuwaka assembly convener   filed a complaint against Balakrishna at the Gajuwaka police station for his derogatory comments against the PM. Sankara Rao stated in the complaint that the actor-turned-politician used "highly abusive language" against the PM, his wife and mother. The police said they will register a case only after seeking legal opinion and verifying the video clippings of Balayya's speech.
