MUMBAI: In a relief for   (OCI) who passed higher and   in Maharashtra, the state government informed the   they would be entitled to both, 15%   and 85% state quota for admissions to undergraduate medical courses in private colleges from 2017-18.

 The state informed its decision to the Nagpur bench of the HC, which then disposed of a petition filed by an OCI student, Pallavi Pitale. She had challenged as “unconstitutional and arbitrary’’ curbs placed by the Maharashtra government on admission of OCIs and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) to UG medical courses.
 
 The contention in her petition filed last year was that she was eligible to seek admission under the 15% management quota of private colleges. But rules 5 and 8 of the Maharashtra Unaided Professional Education Institutions Rules had left OCI, PIO and NRI students ineligible to be considered as “Maharashtra candidates”. Her counsel Akshay Naik said the rules were contrary and repugnant to a 2009 Centre’s notification issued under the Citizenship Act that entitled them to all India quota seats.
 
 Submitting the state’s affidavit, its special counsel L M Acharya said OCI students are eligible to seek admission to 15% all India quota seats after appearing for NEET from 2017-18.
 
 Pravin Shingare, director of directorate of medical education and Research (DMER), informed the HC that from the academic year 2017-18, the MCI too has made them eligible.
 
 On April 18, 2017, the state also issued a notification enabling OCI candidates to seek admission in 15% institutional or management quota in  .
 
 On April 27, the state counsel Acharya informed the HC that after April 18, the state government took another decision to allow OCI students who passed their SSC and HSC and its equivalent exams from the state will also be eligible for seats to the remaining 85% in private unaided colleges.
