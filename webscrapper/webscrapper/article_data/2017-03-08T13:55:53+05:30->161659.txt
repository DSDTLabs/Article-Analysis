BHAGALPUR: The court of ADJ   on Tuesday rejected the   of suspended JD(U)   Mewalal Choudhary, who is accused of committing irregularities in the appointment of 162 assistant professors/junior scientists during his tenure as vice-chancellor of   (BAU) at Sabour in 2012.
 
  Choudhary served BAU as its VC from 2010 to 2015 before he became an MLA from Tarapur in   district.
  
  During the hearing, public prosecutor Satyanarayan Prasad Sah told the court that Choudhary had been charged for under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and should not be granted anticipatory bail.
  
  The petitioner’s lawyers said Choudhary is a respectable person and served at various positions and had no role in the selection process as it was done by a selections committee; hence, he be granted bail.
  
  The BAU had initiated legal action against Choudhary following the chancellor’s nod after a probe committee found the allegations true against him. Many of the appointments were allegedly made by ignoring merit (written scores and academics) whereas high marks were awarded to the selected few in interview and PowerPoint presentation (PPT).
  
  According to BAU sources, a high-level probe was conducted into the gross irregularities committed in the appointments. The committee was headed by Justice (retd) Syed Mohammed Mahfooz Alam of the Patna high court.
  
  The petitioner’s lawyers said they would soon move the Patna high court for Choudhary’s bail.
