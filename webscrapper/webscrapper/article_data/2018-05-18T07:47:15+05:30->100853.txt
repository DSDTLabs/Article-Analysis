CHANDIGARH: Despite reduction in power rates, city industrialists will have to pay more.

 Claiming to promote industrial consumer category, the   (JERC) on the one hand brought down the power rates, but on the other doubled the fixed charges and imposed regulatory surcharge, thus pushing the bills substantially up.
 
 
  
 The tariff of “large supply” category was brought down from Rs 5.65 per unit to Rs 5 per unit, while for consumers of medium supply, the rate was reduced from Rs 5.35 per unit to Rs 4.70 per unit. For small-scale industries, the rate was slashed from Rs 5.3 to Rs 4.8 per unit.
 
 The commission enhanced fixed charges from Rs 100 per kilowatt (KW) to Rs 200 per KW. To help the electricity department recover revenue gap of Rs 180.38 crore, the commission also levied regulatory surcharge.
 
 An industrial unit with a connection load of 205 KW, which consumed 20,000 units per month, got a benefit of Rs 13,000 due to tariff reduction, but ended up paying around Rs 15,000 more due to enhanced fixed charges and regulatory surcharge amounting to Rs 6,400. Another industrial unit with a connection load of 204 KW, which consumed around 18,000 units per month, paid around Rs 12,000 more as a result of enhanced fixed charges and regulatory surcharge of Rs 2,547.
 
 Terming reduction of tariff as a mere eyewash, industrialist Arun Mahajan said, “We continue to reel under high power tariff.”
 
 Unhappy, the industrialists have decided to launch a campaign against Chandigarh administration. “We have been left with no option but to raise our voice,” added Mahajan.
 
 Supporting him, Naveen Manglani, president of  , said different industrial bodies would come together to press the administration for providing relief. 
 
 The administration had set up phases I and II of the Industrial Area on a land measuring 147 acres. Both the phases were allotted between 1973 and 1982.
