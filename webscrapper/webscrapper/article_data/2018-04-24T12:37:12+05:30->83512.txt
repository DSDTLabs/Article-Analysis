HYDERABAD: With the temperature soaring from mid-April, power consumption has gone up drastically with the demand touching 2,800 MW this week and showing no signs of slowing down.

 
 
  
 
  Company Limited (TSSPDCL) officials said the peak power demand of 2,700-2,800 MW in   is generally recorded in mid-May. However, due to the prevailing weather conditions and high temperatures, it has already soared to 2,800 MW in April itself. In the entire state, the current demand has breached 9,000 MW mark.
 
 “From April 18, the power demand has touched 2,800 MW (60 million units) and hovered around the same since then. Saturday and Sunday being holidays, there was a slight dip and the demand had dropped to 2,500 MW. However, Monday saw the demand scaling to 2,700 MW. We are geared up to meet even a higher demand,” director (operations), TSSPDCL, J Srinivas Reddy told TOI.
 
 He said though there has been a rise in power demand, there have been no power cuts. With the hot weather conditions set to continue for a few more days, discom officials are on their toes to ensure that there are no technical defects in transformers and lines.
 
 During the rabi season that begins in the winter, agriculture power demand goes up from December till April. Discom officials manage the demand till the harvest of crops till April as the demand comes down after that. Now, the demand is expected to intensify as harvesting has not yet been completed in some districts like Medak even as the peak summer demand has begun in April itself.
