VADODARA: Strong security arrangements by cops at the Nyay Mandir court premises could not stop   (AAP) workers from splashing black ink at cash-for-marks scam accused Mansukh Shah here on Saturday evening. 

 The city police had deployed assistant commissioner of police (C Division) M A Patel, four police sub-inspectors and several police constables from Raopura and Gotri police stations after   workers had thrown ink at Shah’s aide Vinod alias Bharat Savant. 
 
 The police had made arrangements for security of Shah, Savant and Ashok Tailor. Since AAP workers were raising slogans outside gate 4 since early evening, the police took the trio towards gate 3 but, then again turned them towards the staircase of gate 4. As they reached the ground floor, the constables deployed at the gate, closed the doors. The police again took them inside the court premises and walked the trio towards gate 1 of the iconic building to fool the protesters.
 
 However, a few AAP workers were already waiting outside gate 1. When the police came outside the court premises they rushed towards Shah and other accused and started to splash ink on Shah’s face. The faces of a few anti-corruption bureau (ACB) sleuths and policemen were also covered with ink. During the chaos, one worker of AAP and a few media persons received minor injuries.
 
 The police did not detain any person since it was difficult to identify who threw the ink during the melee. AAP’s city unit president   asked the government to make a case of treason against Shah. “If Patidar leader Hardik Patel can be arrested under treason, why cannot the government make a similar case against Shah,” said Gandhi. He added that this is a major example of thriving of corruption under   rule.
 
 On March 1, Youth Congress workers had thrown ink at Savant when the ACB had received the accused’s remand till Saturday. Shah was saved as he was whisked away by the police from the other gate of the court.
