CHANDIGARH: The sudden exit of 500  , who joined the state education department as junior basic training (JBT) teachers on Friday, badly derailed the operations of the state transport fleet.   on several routes had to be halted due to the extreme staff crunch.

 The department has now decided to outsource bus conductors from Monday as a stop-gap measure. Most of the conductors were qualified   and part of the 9,500 candidates selected by the then Haryana State Teachers Selection Board in August 2014. However, their joining the education department was held up when the selection process was challenged before the Punjab and Haryana high court. The HC cleared their selection process only last week.
 
 To prevent further delay in their joining, the Haryana elementary education department had on Thursday night asked the candidates to join immediately at the office of district elementary education office of concerned districts. The instructions as well as the list of selected candidates were posted on the department's website.
 
 Senior officers in the   said they came to know that around 500 conductors would be joining as teachers only on late Thursday night.
 
 Talking to TOI, Haryana state transport minister Krishan Lal Pawar said that despite Friday being a holiday in the state, an emergency meeting was convened to discuss the sudden shortfall of bus conductors. "We were already under staffed and this has aggravated the problem. We have sent a proposal to the chief minister for immediate hiring of around 1000 conductors and 1500 drivers on outsourcing basis until regular staff is selected by the state staff selection commission," Pawar added.
 
 He further said that they couldn't stop the staffers from leaving as the post of teacher is falls in higher pay grade and employees have right to upgrade themselves.
 
 The medical examination and verification of the new teachers would be done later.
