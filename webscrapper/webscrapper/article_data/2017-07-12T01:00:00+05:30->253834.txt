If all goes as planned, the climax of Emraan Hashmi’s next, 'Captain Nawab', will be shot in the snow-capped regions of our country a few months from now. And to get the action choreography right, director Tony D’Souza has approached  , who has previously worked on films like 'Independence Day', 'Spider Man 2', 'Spider Man 3', 'The Bourne Supremacy', 'The Bourne Ultimatum', 'Superman Returns', 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', 'Where The Wild Things Are', 'Quantum of Solace' and 'Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol'. The modalities are currently being worked out. Emraan plays the central character in the war-drama that aims to spread a message against battles and bloodshed. The actor has already slipped into prep mode for the project.

 Tony confirmed the development, saying, “We’re hopeful that Dan will give his nod to the project. He is very keen. He has an impressive repertoire. Ours is an action film which is anti-war. It’s strange that we engage in wars to achieve peace. The film’s climax will be shot in a snow-clad location and since Dan has done war films before, his experience will come in handy while shooting the sequences.”
 
 Roping in foreign talent often incurs a heavy cost. Bring this up and Tony says, “Actually, most foreign technicians are eager to work here because of our content. Yes, roping in Dan will make our project costly, but the film needs him. We don’t want to compromise on filming a crucial episode in our history just to save some money. We hope to start shooting by the end of September.”
