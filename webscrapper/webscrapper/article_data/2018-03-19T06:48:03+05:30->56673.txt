AHMEDABAD: If Ahmedabad’s depleting   aquifers has not alarmed you much, a recent study on ground water vulnerability by   and   has warned that   is leading to   and accumulation of pollutants.

 The study on Ahmedabad district’s groundwater vulnerability — a term used to represent factors that determine the ease with which groundwater may be contaminated by human activities — has revealed the central and southern parts of the district with 48.4% of the area is under moderate vulnerability, while 5.2% of area in the south-east of district is under high vulnerability.
 
 The northern part of the district which covers 46.4% of area is under low vulnerability. The study was conducted by a team of researchers Mona Khakhar from Cept University, Jayesh Ruparelia and Anjana Vyas from Institute of Technology Nirma University.
 
 The study analyzed parameters like depth, recharge, quality of aquifer, soil, topography, vadose zone — the part of earth between the land surface and the position at which the groundwater is in the soil’s pores — and hydraulic conductivity, which depicts the hydrogeology of the area.
 
 The research also revealed the existence of higher concentrations of contaminants like chloride, total dissolved solids, sulphate, nitrate, calcium, sodium and magnesium.
