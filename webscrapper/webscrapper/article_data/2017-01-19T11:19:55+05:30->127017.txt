 has ordered a new 10-episode limited installment of "Will & Grace" after months of complex and difficult negotiations.
 
  NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke made the announcement during the network's TCA presentation, reported Deadline.
  
  "We're thrilled that one of the smartest, funniest, and most defining comedies in NBC history is coming back," NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt said in a statement.
  
  
 
  
  "This groundbreaking series for everything from gay rights to social and political commentary - all disguised as a high-speed train of witty pop culture - is coming back where it belongs."
  
  The show will bring back the main cast, Eric McCormack,  ,   and  , with series creators Max Mutchnick and   serving as showrunners and executive producers for the revival.
  
  James Burrows, who directed all episodes in the original eight-season run of the series, will direct and executive produce the revival.
  
  "Dave and I are absolutely thrilled about the opportunity to write what Will, Grace, Jack and Karen are thinking about in 2017," said Mutchnick.
  
  
 
  
  McCormack, Messing, Hayes and Mullally recently reunited for a 2016 presidential election PSA. Salke revealed that talks about the revival started right after they shot the PSA.
  
  "Will & Grace", which ran from 1998 until 2006, follows the relationship between best friends Will Truman (McCormack), a gay lawyer, and Grace Adler (Messing), a straight interior designer.
  
  Hayes and Mullally star as their friends Jack and Karen. The show is credited with paving the way for LGBT characters on TV and became a staple on NBC despite initial criticism for its particular portrayal of homosexual characters.
  
  The revival will be treated as a ninth season and pick up a decade after the 2006 finale. No official premiere date is announced for the new installment, but it's expected to air during the 2017-2018 season.
