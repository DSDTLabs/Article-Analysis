INDORE:   on Tuesday registered a first-of-its-kind case against a youth under section 493 A for allegedly raping a woman on the promise of marriage in a live-in relationship. 

 A 26-year-old woman of Chhatribagh approached Vijay Nagar police with a complaint that a resident of Scheme Number 54, Apoorv, who was her  , maintained physical relations with her several times for six years on the promise of marriage. He, however, got married to some other girl and started living with her. Even after she called him several times, he threatened her and stopped talking to her altogether. 
 
 A few months ago, he came back to her and promised her that he was going to divorce the girl he had married in a few months and raped her on the pretext of marriage.
 
  “After the complaint, the accused was   under section 493 A (cohabitation caused by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful marriage) of the IPC and further investigation has been initiated in the case,” said Vijay Nagar police station in charge Sudhir Kumar Das.
 
 Similar case had come up some time ago in Bhopal where a case under same sections was registered against DSP Pawan Mishra. The complainant had claimed that DSP Mishra and she were living as husband and wife for 13 years. The couple also has a 13-year-old child. The child’s school admission form mentions Mishra as his father. The DSP had promised that he will accept as his wife after his retirement in 2020 because he was already married and he cannot keep two wives while in government service. In 2005, she came in contact with Mishra who was posted in Bhopal as police station in charge.
