Ahmedabad: Ahead of the monsoon, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) will launch a major clean-up drive. This year, the municipal commissioner, Mukesh Kumar, has asked zonal engineers to carry out a performance audit of all catch-pit cleaning activities. Apart from this, contractors involved in major construction work along arterial roads and the metro corridor have been asked to pull up their socks and complete their works within a set deadline. For the past few weeks, Kumar has been reviewing monsoon preparations, like the number of dewatering machines available with the AMC. He later examined the action plan of the health department. To prevent flooding in vulnerable areas, the AMC has drawn a list of drainage pumping stations whose capacities have been recently augmented by the water supply and drainage department.
