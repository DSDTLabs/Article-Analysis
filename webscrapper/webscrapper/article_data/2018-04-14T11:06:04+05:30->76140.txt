 MOHALI: Residents of the  , Kharar are grappling with non-supply of drinking water forcing 80 families to get drinking water from water tankers at an exorbitant price. The water connection of the housing society has been cut off by the   (PSPCL) on March 28. 
 
 According to residents, they were receiving erratic water supply from December last year but from March 28 the supply has stopped. Two companies have been supplying them drinking water since March 28.
 
 Vijey Rana, president of the new   society, said, "Despite the high court order, we are facing this mess. The builder of the society has not paid the electricity bill because of which we have been forced to get drinking water supply from water tankers." "Residents are suffering badly. No civic authorities are coming to our rescue. And besides, there are several other problems. The housing society does not have a boundary wall. Street lights of the society are also not operational. The sewerage facilities were also very poor," he added.
 
 Rana said, "The High court in its order dated January 14, 2016 directed the executive officer of the municipal council to inspect the progress of the work to ensure that the left out work is complete in a time-bound manner. When we approached the Kharar municipal council, we were threatened." 
 
 When contacted Sanjiv Tiwari, executive officer of the Kharar municipal council, said "I am on leave for the last 15 days and I am not aware of the matter."
