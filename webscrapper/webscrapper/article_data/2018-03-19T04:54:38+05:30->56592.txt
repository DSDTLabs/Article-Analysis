NEW DELHI: The government has decided not to award   if adequate land is not available for construction. The   board last week decided to avoid a 2010-11 like situation when several highway projects were awarded without availability of land and most of them got stuck for years forcing the government to cancel contracts.

 Sources said the issue of whether   (NHAI) would miss the target for the current financial year came up for discussion at the board meeting on Thursday, which has members from finance ministry and  . 
 
 TOI has learnt that though NHAI representatives were of the view that contracts could be awarded where final notification for land acquisition had been issued, this was shot down in the meeting.
 
 “There are two options before us; we award work to meet target despite being unsure of getting land in time and create another legacy of delayed projects or go for projects where we award work and start construction quickly to finish them on time,” an official who attended the meeting said.
 
 The highway ministry, including NHAI, has awarded about 8,800 km of stretches till March 8 against the target of 25,000 km and has completed construction of approximately 8,200 km against the target of 15,000 km. The government policy is of not issuing work order unless it has 80% land in its possession.
 
 “There are states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Haryana and Tamil Nadu where we can expect to get land within six months from date of final notification. But in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and  , getting land is difficult even 5-6 months after the process of compensation disbursal has started,” another official said.
