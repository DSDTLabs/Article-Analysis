 In the 33-page judgment, the court said, “On the point of sentence, defence counsel argued that the convicts were sole breadwinners of their families so a lenient view should be taken... On the other hand, additional public prosecutor for the state opposed the prayer of convicts on the score that the accused have committed robbery and keeping in view the effect of offence on society at large, they don’t deserve any leniency. Severe and exemplary punishment should be awarded. I have considered the rival submissions… keeping in view the nature of offense committed by the accused, they are not entitled to any lenient view.”
