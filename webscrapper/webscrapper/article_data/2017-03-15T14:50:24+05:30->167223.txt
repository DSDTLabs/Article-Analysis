Singer   feels that Sufism is not a sect, but a way of life. 

  In a recent interview, the 'Namak Ishk Ka' singer said that when she discovered Sufism when she came to the Osho commune to study. “I came to the Osho commune to study Sufi dervish threshold. That’s when I came across Rumi and his spiritual instructor Shams-e-Tabrizi. After studying their life and works, I realised that Sufism, which is popular for its spiritualism, is, in fact, a way of life, not a sect,” she says. 
 
 
  
 
  Talking about working with her husband   on her album ' ', which brought her to fame, “It was way back in 1993, when Vishal started working on composing some of Bulleh Shah’s poetry for the album. When we met   sahab, he was so impressed by Vishal’s work that he agreed to compose some songs in spoken Urdu rather than the academic one, and that’s how songs like 'Tere Ishk me' were born,” she narrates. 
 
 Rekha adds that   is not like picking up a dictionary and throwing a bunch of heavy sounding words together. “I can’t make comments about what others are doing. If that is what they think is right, it’s fine by me. Personally I feel, that Sufi music is much more than jargon words,” she clarifies.
