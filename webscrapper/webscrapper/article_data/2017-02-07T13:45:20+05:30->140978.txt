NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday addressed on motion of thanks to President's address, in  . Here are the highlights: 

 * Various members of the House added vigour into the debate & shared insightful points. I thank the MPs for their participation.
 
 * How can someone see 'SEVA' or any positive virtue in the word SCAM. Sometimes, Mother Earth is also unhappy. There is something very special about Jan Shakti.
 
 * We remember how democracy was under threat from 1975 to 1977, when opposition leaders were jailed, newspaper freedom curtailed.
 
 * It is due to this 'Jan Shakti' that the person born to a poor family can become the Prime Minister of India.
 
 * There are many people like me, who could not die for the nation during the freedom struggle but we are living for India and serving India.
 
 * I was surprised that there were some who made cleanliness also a political issue. Why can't we work together on ushering a Swachh Bharat. 
 
 * In 2014 elections, one party was campaigning on whether they would give 9 or 12 cylinders. But after coming to power, we asked people whether they were willing to give up subsidy. So many people gave up subsidy."

 * I had said it from the Red Fort- every Prime Minister has contributed to the nation
 
 * I was surprised that there were some who made cleanliness also a political issue. Why can't we work together on ushering a Swachh Bharat
 
 * When Rail budget was first presented, the transport sector was different. Now things are different & a more comprehensive look is needed.
  
 * From Day 1, we have been clear- we are ready for a discussion on demonetisation but some were more keen on TV bytes & not debates.
 
 * It does not matter how big you are, you will have to give back what belongs to the poor. My fight is for the poor.
 
 * My fight is for the poor and giving the poor their due. This fight will continue.
 
 * We do not see everything from the prism of elections. The interests of the nation are supreme for us.
 
 * When can you have an operation? When the body is healthy. The economy was doing well and thus our decision was taken at the right time.
 
 * Like Swachh Bharat, the decision on demonetisation is a movement to clean India (from corruption and black money).
 
 * Now, middlemen no longer enjoy the benefits they did. We have stopped the corruption and loot
 
 * Like Swachh Bharat, the decision on demonetisation is a movement to clean India (from corruption and black money) 
 
 * Jab hum kahe Rs 2 lakh se upar ka jewellery khareedne par PAN dikhana padega, bahut logon ne mujhe letters bheje isko raddh karwane ke liye 
 
 * MNREGA has been modified 1035 times. What was the reason? 
  
 * Work for I-T department has been made easy by us. We are keeping a strong vigil on hoarding activities too 
 
 * 22 lakh 27 thousand houses were constructed in one year 
 
 * We have successfully helped install 21,000 crore LEDs, saving public's Rs 11,000 crore.
 
 * We have achieved 100% urea neem coating 
 
 * Rs 7,633 crore leakage in social programs has been stopped by us.
 
 * Crop insurance was in existence earlier also, but farmers didn't want to avail it; It didn't secure the rights of farmers. Why was it that there were crop insurance schemes earlier but farmers were not keen to avail the benefits? 
 
 * It is time to think about having LS and RS elections together; I know everybody will face some problems
 
 * Budget 2017 is benefiting 96% of the population
 
 * Surgical strike was a big decision but none is questioning about it like they do about demonetisation. Lekin desh ka mijaaz dekh kar unhe apni bhaasha badalni padhi
