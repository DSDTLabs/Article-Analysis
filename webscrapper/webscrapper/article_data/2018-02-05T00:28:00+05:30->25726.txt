 Madurai: The AIADMK party high command, in a communication jointly signed by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, says that 95 AIADMK cadres from Madurai and 25 from Virudhunagar, including former minister Valarmathi Jebaraj have been relieved of their party memberships and posts, for their anti-party activities. Valarmathi Jebaraj who held the post of headquarters executive committee member said that, EPS and OPS had no authority to dismiss her from a post that she had held for over 20 years. “I was Amma’s supporter, when this group was in the Janaki faction. After MGR’s death, I got married in her presence even before she became the leader of the party. Who are they to remove me from a post that she bestowed on me?” she asked. She said that her loyalty always remained unchanged and that Amma had always asked them to consult with ‘Chinnamma’ when she was too busy. So they had looked to the latter for guidance and hence she had chosen Chinnamma as her leader after Amma. “OPS and EPS are just dancing to the tune of BJP. They used the influence of PM Modi to get the party symbol and name, but now he too has started ignoring them. Soon this government will fall,” she added.  M Jayabal, Madurai district secretary of the TTV faction, who was also dismissed from his post as Madurai Central – 1, AIADMK secretary. He said that the chief minister and deputy chief minister were jokers and continued to prove the fact by regularly dismissing cadres, who have been in the party for over 20 years. “We have renewed our membership in our party every five years by paying a membership fee ranging from Rs 1 to Rs 10. Will they return this money when they remove us from our party posts? Then they would become bankrupt, because it is our money that they are laying claim to,” he said. “None of us take these press releases announcing our dismissal seriously,” he said adding that the AIADMK would soon come under the leadership of TTV.
