NEW DELHI: From now on,   and their   could face   for defacing   during election   as the Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the urgent implementation of several guidelines related to defacement of public property in the city.

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice   and C Hari Shankar on Tuesday passed the direction to enforce the guidelines by incorporating it in the form of directions on a plea of petitioner and advocate Prashant Manchanda.
 
 According to the guidelines, which were approved by HC Joint Registrar  , who also gave a related report, every college and university will have a permanent committee which will also comprise of members from public authorities. And when it comes to defacement resulting from election campaigns, the law of vicarious liability will apply where politicians will be held liable for the actions of their supporters.
 
 The point of vicarious liability is being incorporated from a Bombay high court judgment which has held, “There shall be a presumption of abetment against the candidates in allowing their names to be spray painted or used in the process of massive defacement of public and private properties to strictly ensure that this process, not only the person, who has actually caused defacement would be responsible, but even the person for whose benefit and whose publicity, the same has been done would also be liable.”
