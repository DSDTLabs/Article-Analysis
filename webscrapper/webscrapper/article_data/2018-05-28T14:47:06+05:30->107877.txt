VISAKHAPATNAM:   have been skyrocketing in the city markets thanks to a drop in production of birds.

 The poultry industry across the state witnesses a drop in production of birds during summer due to unfavourable weather conditions. 
 
 The price of one kg of broiler chicken now stands at Rs 240 in the market. The prices shot up by around Rs 90 in one month. Traders say they would not be surprised if the prices even go up to Rs 300 per kg. The price of country chicken has already touched Rs 350 per kg.
 
 According to sources, the mortality of birds due to high temperatures and a drop in of the weight of birds because of low quantity of intake is also responsible for the soaring prices. The birds grow to a weight of 2.5 kg in 45 days with proper intake. However, in the summer season, the diet of the birds comes down, resulting in a drop in weight of the birds, sources in the poultry sector said.
 
 Presently, broiler meat costs Rs 240 in the market. Even the price of live birds increased in the past one month. The price of mutton is also reaching unaffordable levels as it costs Rs 580 per kg while the traders of fish are fixing the prices at will. 
 
 The fish prices are at Rs 350 to Rs 400 as the conservation period (fishing ban) is on since April 15. The poultry industry sources say the prices would come down from the second week of June after the summer conditions come down.
