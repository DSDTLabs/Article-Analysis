Ludhiana: A team of senior officials of National Investigation Agency (NIA) from Delhi questioned the Hindu outfit leader   in the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) for one hour on Friday. The official asked him to bring his car in which he was attacked. The official also asked Arora to recreate the scene when he was sitting inside his car and the assailants attacked him. Arora reached CIA by around 12noon, and was questioned for an hour. Importantly, NIA is investigating all cases of targeted killings in Punjab, and Amit Arora was the first target of radicals who fortunately escaped in the attack.

 On 3 February 2016, when Arora — along with his gunman and workers — was having soup from a stall in Basti Jodhewal Chowk, he was attacked by assailants. The bullet passed through his neck, and he sustained minor injury. The Jodhewal police registered a case of ‘attempt to murder’ against unidentified accused. However later, when they could not solve it, they framed Arora, his gunman, workers, and other people for stage-managing the attack. The police also claimed Arora got injured on his neck by using a hot piece of iron rod (sariyia) and hatched a conspiracy to get more security.
 
 However recently, when the Punjab police arrested shooters of targeted killings — Ramandeep Singh and Hardeep Singh Shera — the police claimed the accused had confessed they had opened fire at Arora, but he survived. The confession of the accused raised fingers on Punjab police and its investigation. Amit Arora said: “Today, I was called by NIA officials at CIA office, as senior officers form Delhi reached here to question me. I was questioned for hours about the attack, and the threats I was getting. Besides, they checked my car and asked me to recreate the crime scene.”
