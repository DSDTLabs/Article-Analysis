RIYADH: A Malayali man has returned home after twenty-four years, thanks to the amnesty declared by the Saudi government. However, unlike others, he has a different story to tell. 

  alias  , from   in Thiruvananthapuram, had landed in the kingdom in 1993. His sponsor took him to a village called  , 150km from Hail city. There he was asked to look after the goats at the sponsor's farm. Adjacent to it were vast tracts of vacant land, which he converted into a date farm. There after his life was confined to the farm and the sponsor's house. However, though he missed his family, he never thought of escaping from the place. 
 
 The sponsor regularly transferred money into Kasim's wife's bank account. Sufficient funds were also sent to marry off his four daughters. But since the sponsor lost Kasim's passport, he couldn't visit his home even once. Now, with the 90-day amnesty he arranged all the required documents through the help desk and has flown back to Kerala.
