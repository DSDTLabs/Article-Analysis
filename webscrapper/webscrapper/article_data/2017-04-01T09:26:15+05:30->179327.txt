CHANDIGARH: Punjab government has marked a time bound inquiry into the irregularities in the working of de-addiction and   in the state as pointed out in the CAG report.

 Health and family welfare minister Brahm Mohindra said health secretary   would head the inquiry and sumbit the report within a week. Mohindra said it was a   as huge amount of public money had been spent on these centres while the deliverance was nil. The findings of the report will be taken very seriously and proper legal and criminal action initiated against those whose names figure in the report, he added.
 
 Mohindra said that during the previous SAD-BJP regime, the centres were run without   from the government. He alleged there was a nexus between anti-social elements and persons running these illegal centres. This needs to be thoroughly probed so that the people of Punjab come to know about the misgovernance of the previous regime. 
 
 The CAG report tabled in the Punjab assembly had stated that the test check records in the selected districts showed that against 1,75,108 drug addiction patients registered in OPD, only 11,186 were taken to IPD, which ranged between 1% and 19% in the eight model drug deaddiction centres/drug deaddiction centres during 2013 and 2016 while the percentage of unutilized bed capacity in these centres ranged between 17% and 60% during the same period.
 
 There are 35 drug de-addiction and rehabilitation centres which were running without proper license from the government while another five are not functional at all.
