HYDERABAD: Though many amusement parks are coming up in and around Hyderabad, Telangana government has no clarity on who would deal with the   such as giant wheels and roller coasters. At any time of the year,   having giant wheels and other adventure rides function at People’s Plaza, NTR Gardens, etc.

 
 The tragedy in Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur town, in which a seven-year-old girl was killed, has once again turned the spotlight on lack of a singular agency in both the Telugu states to monitor the safety of rides at permanent or temporary amusement parks. Fire department says that mechanical protection doesn’t come under its purview and tourism department has no teams to inspect the amusement parks for mechanical safety.
 
  
  
  
  
 
 V Papaiah, regional fire officer of Telangana, said, “We look only at fire safety. Roads and buildings department deals with structural aspects.”
 
 D Murali Mohan, regional fire officer of Southern Region of Andhra Pradesh, said, “We give fire safety permit to exhibitions and amusement parks. We don’t have the expertise to check machinery. Tourism department has a more significant role in it. Even for firecracker shops, fire department gives only No-Objection Certificate. Fire department checks if extinguishers are available and if there is a water source to douse the flames. Mechanical safety is not our concern.”
 
 Muralikrishna, Anantapur III town police station inspector, said, “We have booked a criminal case against the owner and operator of the giant wheel. They obtained permission from the collector, fire department, electricity wing, roads and buildings and municipality, but their maintenance is not good. For mechanical safety, owner is responsible. There is no agency to conduct periodic checks.”
