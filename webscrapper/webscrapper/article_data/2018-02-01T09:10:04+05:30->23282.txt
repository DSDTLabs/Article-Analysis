MADURAI: Students were urged to ensure that source segregation of waste is done in their homes and also to create awareness on the importance of solid waste management for a better environment by the   commissioner   on Wednesday.

 Inaugurating the seminar on solid waste management organised by ROSA (Reach Out to Society through Action) and   on Wednesday, he urged the students to participate in making the city clean and also in the Swachh Survekshan 2018 by downloading the Swachhata App.
 
 He said that on an average a citizen of Madurai generates half a kilogram of waste per day and 700 tonnes of garbage reaches the dumping yard of the Madurai Corporation in   to be recycled. The work could be done more efficiently if the people segregated their waste at source and ensured that it did not reach the landfills. People generating waste weighing more than 100 kg should produce manure or biogas at source in the place of generation, he said.
 
 Founder of the Centre of Environmental Services, S V Pathy, explained the ways in which waste could be recycled in his keynote address. Human hair was a rich source of amino acid and the Thirumala temple in   was making Rs 720 crore per annum by selling the hair donated by pilgrims to pharmaceutical firms, he said.
 
 Pathy explained that if human hair was cut into small pieces, mixed with a small amount of coconut husk, moist soil and cow dung and kept in air tight container, it would turn into a rich humus, which if used for plants like jasmines and roses could produce most fragrant and colourful flowers. Human hair which is discarded into drains, clogs them and it costs the Madurai Corporation Rs 60 lakh per year for cleaning clogged drains, he said.
 
 Coconut shells which are thrown into the soil, take sixteen years to degrade, whereas if burnt it could be used as activated carbon in many products and hence should be collected and sold off to garbage collectors, he added.
