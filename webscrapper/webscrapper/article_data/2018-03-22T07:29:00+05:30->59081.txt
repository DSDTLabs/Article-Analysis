CHANDIGARH: SAD president   on Wednesday said the Punjab governor’s address to the assembly on Tuesday was a visionless document which only mentioned achievements of the Badal government.

 He said in 29-page governor’s address, it was for the first time in the history of Punjab that an incumbent government had recognized the work of its predecessor. “Besides this, the governor’s address has virtually abdicated Punjab’s claim on important issues including justice for the 1984 victims and transfer of Chandigarh and Punjabi speaking areas by omitting their reference,” said Sukhbir.
 
 He asked the state   government to list one achievement listed in the document which had not been implemented by the SAD-BJP government. He added the address seemed to have got two things wrong – the dates and the name of the chief minister, which was   and not  .
 
 The former deputy chief minister said the Congress should name one welfare scheme it had initiated, saying all such schemes – be it free power, old age pension or Shagun scheme – had been initiated by the SAD-BJP government. He also said the Congress government has also listed a new industrial and business policy while forgetting that the Invest Punjab department had been created by the SAD-BJP government.
 
 Sukhbir said, “The Congress government has done nothing on the irrigation front but has listed this in the governor’s address despite the fact that the SAD-BJP government spent Rs 3,070 crore on this during its tenure.”
 
 He said the government had also tried to take credit for the Pardhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna despite the fact that the scheme was launched by PM   during the SAD-BJP government. “The Congress government is also talking about subsidy for drip irrigation when it has not given any such subsidy and forgotten that Rs 300 crore was given to farmers under this head by the previous SAD-BJP government,” said the SAD president.
