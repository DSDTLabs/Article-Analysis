Ishaan Khatter, who is all set to make his acting debut with legendary Iranian filmmaker  's '
 ', has left no stone unturned to get into the skin of his character. In the film, Ishaan plays Amir, a   boy, who does whatever it takes to survive. According to a unit hand, the actor spent a lot of time with some boys from Dharavi, especially Akash, a local youngster who plays his best friend in the movie. The two bonded over several things, including music.

 Says an insider, “Ishaan spent a lot of time with these boys to understand their ways, mannerisms and ideology. When he realised that Akash is a rapper, he also learnt to rap a few lines from him. They would often jam together on the sets, with Akash rapping and Ishaan beatboxing. Now, the two have become really good friends.”
 
 Ishaan says, “During the early stages of casting, I met Akash aka Sense and the boys (Rahul, Naveen and Paul), who are exceptionally talented rappers. Majidi sir wanted me to be a part of their final audition, to see if we looked believable as friends. He asked us to jam together, so while they rapped, I grooved and beatboxed with them. We soon became pals and they gave me an insider’s view of Dharavi. Bonding with them helped me build a backstory for the character that I play in the film. During the course of the shoot, we became close friends. We still meet and jam every now and then.”
