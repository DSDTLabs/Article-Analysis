AHMEDABAD:   alias  , an alleged Indian Mujahideen member involved in the July 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts, was nabbed by Delhi police on Wednesday. Police say Aariz was a member of the Atif Amin module, most of whose members belong to Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh.

 Aariz is a key accused in the Ahmedabad blasts case and is allegedly the person who assembled the bombs at a rented house in the Danilimda area of the city.
 
 “Aariz was instrumental in planting of the bombs along with Atif Amin and others who had come from Delhi for the task. Aariz left for Delhi by train with other members after planting the bombs, with tickets booked on fake names,” added a crime branch official investigating the serial blasts case.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Deepan Bhadran said Aariz was also at   when the special cell of Delhi Police raided the place. “The raid resulted in an gunfight which left two suspects, Atif Amin and Chota Sajid, dead while inspector Mohanchand Sharma of Delhi special cell was also killed,” added DCP Bhadran.
 
 DCP Bhadran said a team will soon leave for Delhi to interrogate Aariz. “His interrogation could provide us important clues to nab the 14 remaining accused in the serial blasts case,” DCP Bhadran said.
 
 Aariz’s arrest comes days after the alleged founder member of IM and key terror suspect Abdul Subhan Qureshi was arrested by the Delhi police special cell. Qureshi is allegedly a key conspirator in the Ahmedabad serial blasts along with the Bhatkal brothers, Riaz and Iqbal and Ahmed Sidibapa alias Yasin Bhatkal.
 
 “The July 26, 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts, where 21 bombs went off at 17 places, claimed 56 lives and left 200 people injured,” said a senior police official.
