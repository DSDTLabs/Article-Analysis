It’s been a long time, 16 years to be specific, since   directed a “pure love story.” Anandam, the 2001 blockbuster, was his last. With Mister, the filmmaker is revisiting the genre he began his career with — romance. It was with the 1999 Ravi Teja-Maheshwari love saga, Nee Kosam that Sreenu Vaitla announced his arrival in Tollywood. Eighteen years on, the filmmaker is trying to prove his mettle once again after the debacle of his two previous films — Aagadu and  . He is confident of turning over a new leaf with the upcoming Varun Tej-starrer. “Although I have directed love stories before I have never really attempted a love triangle before.   is actually a travel-based love triangle, let’s just say it is a genre that I’ve always wanted to do but never really could,” he says, smiling.
Produced by   and   on Lakshmi Narasimha Productions, Mister is releasing on April 14, and the filmmaker is confident that his heart is in the right place this time. “I’ve always wanted to do a travel film with grand visuals. When   (story writer) narrated the plot line almost two-years ago, I really got excited. It took us eight months to finalise the script which was written with   in mind,” says Sreenu adding, “I have never travelled as much as I did for this film. We shot in locations like Spain (in 11 different cities), Switzerland, and pristine locations like Mangalore, Ooty, and Kerala. Not even one shot was filmed in Hyderabad.”
 The USP of the film though will be the entertainment quotient and Varun’s performance says the filmmaker. “The audience always expect comedy from my films and Mister will not disappoint in that score. Varun Tej’s comic timing in the film is going to be a revelation for the audience,” says Sreenu, adding, “The film has everything — action, romance, comedy, family emotions.”
