KOCHI: Mass recital of  , a Malayalam poem on Christ's Life used to be an integral part of Christian households during the lent period ahead of Easter. Though the tradition disappeared over the years, various churches in the city are encouraging parishioners to keep it alive.  's Church in Chettikadu, North Paravoor, is one among them. 

 "We have been regularly hosting an All Kerala Puthen Pana recital completion for the past few years. It is usually conducted one week ahead of Palm Sunday. We came across a lot of young people in our community who are doing their best to carry forward the rich legacy of Puthen Pana. So as elders and mentors we wanted to help them by giving a platform and it has yielded good results," said Fr Joy Kallarackal, Rector of St Antony's Church.
 
 Puthen Pana, written by Johann Ernst Hanxleden a German Jesuit missionary also known as Arnos Pathiri, is to Christian households what  's Adyatma Ramayanam is to Hindus. A grammarian, lexicographer and philologist,   is believed to have written the poem between 1721 and 1732, said Fr Kallarackal.
 
 Puthen Pana has 14 padams (Cantos). The first padam is a brief introduction by the author stating that he is writing the poem as per the request of Antonio Pimental, archbishop of Cranganore. The second and third padam tells the story of creation of universe and man. The successive padams are about annunciation, nativity, the sermon on the mount, last supper, trial and crucifixion, resurrection and ascension.
 
 "The 12th padam, portraying the lamentation of Mother Mary is the most important part of the poem," said Fr Sunny Puthenpurayil, research officer at Arnos Pathiri Academy.
