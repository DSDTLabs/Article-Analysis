 is a well-known face in  . She has already made her big screen debut. Now she is ready to taste her luck in a mainstream commercial movie. Speculation is rife that the ‘Sat Bhai Champa’ actress has now joined the cast of Dev’s next movie ‘Hoichoi Unlimited’. Sayantani hasn’t yet revealed any details of her role in this Aniket Chattopadhyay directorial.

 However, a source close to the development has revealed that the actress will be seen as a dancer and her character is closely linked with Saswata Chatterjee’s character. Word is that Sayantani will also share screen space with Dev and this will be her first film with the Tollywood heartthrob. Sayantani will also play a key role in Srijit Mukherji’s upcoming film ‘Uma’.
 
 ‘Hoichoi Unlimited’ will have a serious story wrapped in comedy with a social message to all. There will be no particular central character, rather ‘Hoichoi’ will cast four different age groups.
 
 The shooting will mostly be done in Uzbekistan. A few years ago director Aniket visited the central Asian country and planned to make a comedy after meeting an Indian tourist group there. Both Dev and Aniket will soon travel to   to select the shooting spots and if all goes according to plan, ‘Hoichoi’ will release during Durga Puja this year.
