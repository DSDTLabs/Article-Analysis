Hollywood icon  's sons are engaged in a legal battle over the rights to exhibit their mother's memorabilia. 

 'The Roman Holiday' star's sons have filed a lawsuit in LA Superior Court on the issue, reported Variety.
 
  
  
 
 Luca  , the younger son, is the chairman of Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund. 
 
 As per the suit, the elder son,   has been obstructing the efforts of the charity to display the souvenirs related to the legendary actress. 
 
 Both   and Dotti jointly own Hepburn's effects. 
 
 Shortly after her death in the year 1993, they formed the charitable trust and legally agreed to donate proceeds from exhibitions to several children's charities. 
 
 But the lawsuit claims that Ferrer ran into financial doldrums in 2008 and 2009.
