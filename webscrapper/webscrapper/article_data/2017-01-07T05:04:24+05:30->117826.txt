MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Friday restrained the state from cancelling provisional admissions granted in 2016-17 to students aged above 20 for five-year integrated LLB courses and above 30 years for three-year LLB courses. The order comes as a relief for students whose exams begins in two weeks.

 Two students had moved the HC to challenge the Bar Council of India’s (BCI) age bar which was being sought to be imposed by the state by granting only provisional admissions to such students. The BCI in September 2016 said students above 20 years and 30 years cannot be granted admission to the five-year and three-year LLB courses.
 
 The Maharashtra state law Common Entrance Test had in its prospectus said “candidates who do not fit in the age criteria will be given provisional admission subject to final approval from the BCI or the state law department.” Venkatesh Dhond, counsel for the students, arguing before a bench headed by Chief Justice   that unless the prospectus is stayed, the admissions already granted may be jeopardized.
 
 Advocate   who filed a PIL last September to challenge the constitutional validity of the age-bar rule said that the BCI was supposed to file its reply last October but it had not done so. Amit Sali, BCI counsel, then sought to tender its 110-page reply. When the Chief Justice asked what the affidavit says, he said, “We want to streamline the admissions. We want committed people to come in…” 
 
 The Chief Justice said, “Are you saying those who join a few years later are not committed?...There are so many who want to study law to understand law and to excel at their jobs and not necessarily practice? Why should they be deprived?” The HC asked Tavaria to file a rejoinder in two weeks. The matter is likely to be heard by a larger bench after four weeks, as there are divergent judgments on the issue. ( With inputs from Yogita Rao)
