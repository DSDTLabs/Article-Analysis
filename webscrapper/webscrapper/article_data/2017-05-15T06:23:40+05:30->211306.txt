BENGALURU:   was 24 weeks pregnant when she contracted  . She was brought to the hospital with   and rupture in uterus membranes. She delivered immediately after reaching the hospital in July 2015. But that’s when her troubles began. Her daughter, who weighed 680 grams, didn’t cry soon after birth. Her survival chances were less than 20 per cent.

 Suman, 29, witnessed her newborn suffer five heart attacks in seven days, necessitating manual cardiac compression and medicines.Survival chances for one cardiac arrest even in older children is between 3% and 17 % despite all care. But this baby, despite five such arrests, fought her battle in the   for three months and made complete recovery.
 
 The tough time is over now, says a relieved Suman as she poses for a photograph with daughter Kashvi. “My daughter walks now and tries to speak. As per the vaccination calendar, she is one year and four months old,” she says. 
 
 Kashvi battled all complications of prematurity such as a lung problem, needing high-end artificial respiratory support, gut problem which prevented her from feeding, infections, brain bleeding, kidney malfunction, cardiac instability with inability of the heart to pump effectively and blood clotting.
 
  Dr Parimala V Thirumalesh, senior consultant, HoD, neonatology and paediatrics, Aster CMI Hospital, who took care of the baby, said: “Her heart rate was low. Every time she had an attack, we would physically massage her and wait for the heart to resume. It was a testing time for everyone. Once the attack sustained for over 15-20 minutes and we thought she might not survive, but we didn’t give up hope or efforts. The girl sustained it all.”
 
 When a newborn faces trauma immediately after birth, there are chances that it can result in physical disability. In Kashvi’s case, she is perfectly fine and that’s unique, the doctor added.
