KOLKATA: For several citizens, revelry seemed to give them the licence to flout laws, as was evident from the fact that 450 people were arrested, more than 750 fined and 12 motorcycles seized in Kolkata and Bidhannagar on New Year's Eve. The list does not include thousands of others, who dodged police personnel and ran amok, especially on EM Bypass and the New Town arterial road. 

 The figures are higher than that last year, when 326 people were arrested from Kolkata and seven from Bidhannagar. This year, the numbers are 374 and 76.
 
 Drink driving was not the only offence offenders were booked, the police took a strict stand against brawls as well. At Eco Park, a clash broke out between some revellers and the police, with the visitors complaining they were refused food and liquor, as was mentioned in the pass. The park authorities, however, played it down, claiming some people under the influence of alcohol got into a minor brawl. Complaints of women being harassed and molested were reported from parties in and around  .
 
 The police said this time, they took a strict stand against drink driving and brawls. "Our motto was to save lives and not just log a high arrest number. We arrested people to ensure they were off the roads so that they did not endanger others' lives. We succeeded in our plan as there was no road accident death on New Year's Eve," said a Lalbazar officer. 
 
 But night did not pass without accidents. On EM Bypass at Anandapur, a Tata Sumo hit an Ola cab minutes before midnight, injuring two passengers of the cab and the driver. Near Eco Park at New Town, three bikers were injured in two accidents, one of them having rammed into a divider and another one, carrying a pillion rider, crashing into a lamp post. On Sunday morning, a private car, taking an illegal u-turn on Red Road, hit an ambulance ferrying a patient. Three in the ambulance, including the patient, suffered injuries and were taken to a private hospital on EM Bypass.
