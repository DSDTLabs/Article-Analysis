KOCHI: Over 1,000 people working for commercial organisations located at   joined hands for a candlelight march to protest against the possible closure of trade establishments following a high court order.

 “As per the high court order, passed in January , over 240 commercial establishments operating in Panampilly Nagar without a dangerous and offensive (D&O) license would have to be closed down by March 21. By doing so, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs,“ said Biju C Vallavanadan, secretary of Panampilly Nagar Association of Commercial Establishments (PACE). Over 1,000 protesters rallied at the GCDA Shopping Complex at 4.30 pm for the candle light march, holding banners reading `Save Panampilly Nagar' and `Blackout Day'. 0“Once the order is implemented Panampilly Nagar will lose its charm. The land value of all the properties in this locality will fall,“ said Vallavanadan, who founded PACE.
 
 “Though it was a housing colony around 47 years ago, the locality has changed in many ways. This has not been properly accounted for as the corporation has not surveyed the area ,“ said Vallavanadan.
 
 In response to the growing anxieties among shop owners and traders, the regional town planning office had commenced the survey of the locality this month.
 
 Girinagar councillor P D Martin, who joined candle light march, said that the concerns of residents regarding the traffic situation were genuine but it would not be fair to close down commercial establishments all of sudden. “The commercial organisations did not appear in Panampilly Nagar overnight. The residents, local entrepreneurs and authorities concerned must come together and find a middle ground because traffic scenario in Panampilly Nagar is also a concern that must be resolved,“ said Martin.
