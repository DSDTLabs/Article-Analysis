BENGALURU: Vacant plots turning into dumping yards, proper collection of waste from schools and the need to process waste at the ward level were some solid waste management issues discussed at the event.

 Padmavathi Mallappa, a participant, said “Wherever there are vacant plots, it soon becomes a garbage yard. In cases like these, who is supposed to clean these plots? The BBMP should identify the owner and they should ensure the plots are kept clean.
 
 
 Narasimha Prasad, a resident of RR  , insisted that the city’s waste should not be transported to waste processing units on the outskirts. “Why should people living in other villages suffer because of waste generated by us?” he asked. “As stipulated by the high court, ward committees and the BBMP must identify locations within each ward where waste processing plants can be set up.”
 
 Padmaja L of   wanted BBMP to increase its fleet of garbage-collecting autos. “The   must assign one vehicle for 10 or 15 streets,” he said. “If all vehicles start work at the same time, they can finish garbage collection in about three hours.”
 
 One spinoff of faulty garbage collection, residents of   said, is the increase in the stray dog population. “When we spoke to health officers, they said the Palike did not have sheds to house the dogs for 2-3 days for the sterilization process,” one resident said. “The programme had been suspended. But these are just lame excuses.”
