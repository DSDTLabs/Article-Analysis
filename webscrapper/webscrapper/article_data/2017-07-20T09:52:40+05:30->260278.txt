PUNE: The regional transport office (RTO) had instructed all drivers and conductors of school buses to physically demonstrate the safety feature in their vehicles, especially the emergency door to children.

 They should also tell the students how to react in case they are faced with an emergency situation. This is similar to the procedure played out in airplanes by the cabin crew prior to take-off.
 
 “Keeping it in mind, a day-long workshop is being organized for drivers, conductors, school transport committees and parents by the RTO office at the   on July 22. Several aspects related to safety features will be dealt by the workshop in addition to live demonstrations so that it can have a cascading effect,” Babasaheb  , the regional transport officer, said on Wednesday.
 
 The officer added that the workshop had to be conducted as the new academic session began recently.
 
 “It is not that the bus drivers or conductors have to do it every day. With the new session having recently started, the students need to know about the safety features. They need to know about the emergency gates and how to open or dismantle them in the case of an emergency. They should know about the right way to get out of the bus as panicking can further aggravate the situation. Furthermore, the school transport committees will have to perform the drill from time to time so that children do not forget,” Ajri pointed out.
 
 At present, there is a total of 3,680 registered vehicles ferrying school students in the city. This includes nearly 1,000 vans.
 
 “Students can be given three situations — a fire in the bus, a major accident or an accident that has caused the bus to overturn and the bus stranded in an awkward angle. Children will be taught how to deal with each of the situations. Buses ferrying girl students must have female attendants. People who come across buses without female attendants should report it to the RTO immediately,” the senior official added.
