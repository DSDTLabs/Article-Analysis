LUCKNOW:   attacked a 4-year-old boy and injured him severely on Rana Pratap Marg in Hazratganj area late on Saturday night. The   almost punctured the right eye of the boy.

The boy's uncle Kishore told TOI that Ayan was playing with some children outside his house at around 9pm on Saturday when a pack of stray dogs attacked him. The dogs almost punctured Ayan's right eye and bit his upper lip, right cheek and right wrist. Ayan also lost his two teeth in the attack. Some passersby rushed to his assistance. Kishore said that dogs would have continued attacking Ayan if passersby would have not rescued him in time. Ayan was rushed to Civil Hospital from where he was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre. 
 
 "We kept running from one department to another at Trauma Centre to get treatment for Ayan. The doctors later discharged him at around 2.30am though we are apprehensive whether he will be able to see," he said. The boy is now at his home.
 
 KGMU chief medical superintendent Dr S N Shankhwar said that the injuries required primary medical attention only. "We will ensure free treatment from plastic surgery department and ophthalmology department," said Dr Shankhwar. 
 
 Bapu Nagar residents, meanwhile, complained about growing dog menace in the area. The nuisance of stray dogs has gradually increased in the area due to negligence of authorities, said Shanta Prasad, a local. "A ferocious pack of dogs roams from Moti Mahal lawns to Parivartan Chowk crossing and often attacks passersby," he said.
