COIMBATORE: The All India Road Transport Workers’ Federation on Saturday unveiled the plans to float an alternative company similar to Uber and Ola to help auto and taxi drivers. The project would be launched on a pilot basis in Kerala. Based on the response, the model would be replicated in other states.

 K K Divakaran, national secretary,  , and general secretary, All India Road Transport Workers’ Federation, said they have already spoken to the Kerala government regarding this.
 
 He was speaking at the eighth national conference of the Tamil Nadu Auto Workers’ Federation here on Saturday.
 
 “We have a welfare board that has been set up for the workers. It will invest money and we will launch an application as well. Just like these private companies, we will also set up an alternative firm to ensure the livelihood of our drivers,” he said. Divakaran said it would take three more months to launch the app. “As part of the trade union, we will launch it in Chennai as well on a pilot basis,” he said.
 
 The trade unions are already in talks with business experts to run the company professionally.
 
 Divakaran said the All India Road Transport Workers’ Federation has announced a nation-wide strike in the third week of June to protest the amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act. “The amendment will result in increased insurance premiums and higher fines. Besides, it supports the corporate sector. These corporates are planning to bring 10,000 electric vehicles that will further affect us,” said a member.
