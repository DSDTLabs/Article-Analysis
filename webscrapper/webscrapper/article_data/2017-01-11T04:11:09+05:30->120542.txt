NEW DELHI: IGI’s Terminal 2, which was to be made operational on January 1 to decongest the existing domestic terminal, 1D, will be thrown open only after mid-February. 

 Two airlines,   and GoAir, have refused to move out of 1D, delaying the opening of  , which recently underwent refurbishment and a security survey. Sources said the airlines had asked the airport operator DIAL to compensate the operational shift by lowering its charges. 
 
 In a letter sent to DIAL in December, SpiceJet expressed its inability to shift its operations to Terminal 2 on a temporary basis. “The same is also not in the interest of various other stakeholders of SpiceJet,” it had said. 
 
 Denying various media reports indicating shifting of SpiceJet’s functions, it said, “SpiceJet has always denied such shifting of operations, as and when contacted by media.” Such reports create confusion in the minds of SpiceJet’s passengers and may impact its business for which “DIAL will be fully responsible”, the letter pointed out. 
 
 GoAir, the other airline that was supposed to move out, earlier confirmed to TOI that they were not shifting.
 
 The new facility is part of the expansion plan of 1D. “This move will help in reducing passenger rush and aircraft movement at 1D. The T2 users will have parking space in front of the IGI police station that will be shifted. A multilevel parking lot will also be available,” said an airport official.
 
 According to sources, the size of Terminal 1D will increase from 53,000 sq m to 1.33 lakh sq m and once the plan is implemented, it is likely to cater to about 30 million flyers annually compared to the present 18 millions.
