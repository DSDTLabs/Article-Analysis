KOLHAPUR: Congress corporator   on Wednesday alleged that the civic body was procuring garbage bins of poor quality. He demanded an enquiry in the alleged scam in the procurement process.

 The   (KMC) spent Rs 1.8 crore for procurement of the containers. For each  , the KMC spent Rs 39,000. Most of the containers have been placed in suburban areas after complaints from local residents. 
 
 Shete said the container’s weight should have been 430kg. However, the container procured by the KMC weighs 340kg as the material of the container is of poor quality. “The guarantee for each container should be 3 to 4 years according to the rules. But the procured containers have just a one-year guarantee. According to technical specifications, the cost of each container should be Rs 18,000. The KMC has procured the containers at an additional cost of Rs 21,000,” he said.
 
 The KMC decided to procure garbage bins and ghantagadis to ensure 100% waste collection. In all, 750 bins are needed to cover the whole city. Earlier, the KMC had only 300 at its disposal. The civic body has undertaken the task of repairing the old containers at its workshop. Apart from this, 200 ghantagadis will soon be procured and will be handed over to private parties involved in the collection and transportation of the waste.
 
 Responding to the allegations,   the KMC’s chief sanitation inspector said, “I have not received the copy of the allegations. The procurement of these containers is the responsibility of the work-shop department.”
 
 Shete demanded that along with the enquiry, the losses caused to the civic body because of the flawed procurement process should be recovered from the officials involved and a criminal investigation should be carried out against them. Shete alleged that the deal caused a Rs 64-lakh loss to the KMC.
