 D’Cruz is thrilled that she is sharing screen space with two of the most versatile actors in the industry —   and   — in Mubarakan and Baadshaho, respectively. Ask the actress how different the two are from each other, and she says, “Anilji’s enthusiasm is infectious; there’s never a dull moment with him around. He has been in the industry for many years and despite the variety of roles he has played on screen, he still gives every film his 100 per cent. I like Ajay’s quiet confidence; he doesn’t make too much of a show when he is on set. He knows his ability and can sleepwalk through his roles, but even then, he will concentrate on every aspect of his character. Both Anil and Ajay have been very supportive of me.” 

 In fact, Ileana is one of those actresses who has been paired opposite actors from across the spectrum. While she debuted in Bollywood with Ranbir Kapoor, she has romanced  , Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Varun Dhawan and now, Arjun Kapoor, on screen. “While Varun was a ball of energy, dying to prove himself, Arjun’s comic timing and surprising calmness on the set is interesting. Every actor brings something unique to their role and I guess I’m lucky to have learnt something from all of them,” she sums up.
