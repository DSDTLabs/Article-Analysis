GHAZIABAD: A 25-year-old Nandgram resident was allegedly murdered by one of his friends in Meerut’s   on the intervening night of April 19 and 20.

 The parents of the deceased alleged the police were not arresting the accused because he hails from an influential family. The father of the deceased has discarded the police theory that his son was accidentally shot during a celebratory firing in Meerut. He has lodged an FIR against one Happy Sharma for murdering his son.
 
 The deceased has been identified as Deepanshu Nigam. According to his father  , his son got a call from Happy on April 19 and he was asked to come to the latter’s office in Patel Nagar. Later, my son was asked to accompany Happy to Meerut to attend a wedding.
 
 “My son was reluctant to go, but still he went with Happy around 4pm. Later in the night around 12.30am, I got a call from my neighbour, who asked me to call my son on his mobile phone. However, when I called on the phone, it was picked by someone from Kharkhoda police station, and he asked me to immediately come there. When I reached, I was told my son had died after being shot in the head,” said Lal.
 
 Police had said Deepanshu might have died in celebratory firing. “But when I was showed the two and a half hour video footage of the marriage function that my son had attended with Happy, I could not see any of them there. My son has been killed in a planned manner over some dispute which I am not aware of. The police are yet to arrest the accused. I want justice for my son,” added Lal.
 
 Deepanshu’s mother Kusum Lata said her son used to work in Happy’s advertising company till 2 years back, but later started his own business. 
 
 SHO (Kharkhoda)   said: “We are exploring both the celebratory firing as well as the personal animosity angles. We have sought call details of the persons involved and checking the gun licences of people who attended the marriage function.”
