PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   unit of the   is carrying out a drive under which the party’s corporators, MLAs and MPs from the city will each adopt one   

 Elaborating on this initiative,  , ruling party leader in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “The civic administration spends a huge amount annually on the municipal education department. It provides free education material. Still, municipal schools face problems like lack of infrastructure, cleanliness, drinking water supply, furniture and teachers. This is causing the number of students studying in civic schools to decline over the years.”
 
 “To change this, our Pimpri Chinchwad unit will hold a school adoption drive. The party corporators, MLAs and MPs will adopt one school each. They will each go to their adopted school 2-3 times a week, take note of the shortcomings and inform the civ ic administration for corrective measures,” he added.
 
 Apart from keeping a watchful eye over their schools, each “adopter” will also provide the school with two English teachers, and pay their expenses. This, the party hopes, will go a little way in improving the quality of education at civic-run schools in Pimpri Chinchwad.
 
 “In case the adopter is unable to pay, the party will bear the expense. This will help improve the   skills of the municipal school students. We will also explore the possibility of providing English teachers to municipal schools through Corporate Social Responsibility funds.”
 
 Pawar said Chinchwad MLA Laxman Jagtap, who also happens to be the president of BJP’s city unit, led by example. Jagtap adopted a municipal school in Pimple Gurav and even visited it on Monday.
 
 “Corporators from other parties are also welcome to participate in the drive,” Pawar said. 
 
 There are 136 municipal primary and 18 secondary schools in Pimpri Chinchwad. The BJP has 77 corporators, two MLAs and a Rajya Sabha MP, and so 80 municipal schools stand to benefit from the drive.
