Singer-songwriter   is deeply impressed with  ' solo efforts, insisting his debut album will be a smash. 

 Styles has been working on new music since his boy band One Direction kicked off a hiatus at the end of 2015, and, according to fellow British pop star Sheeran, the   is doing a good job. 
 
  
  
 "I've heard a little bit," Sheeran said of Styles' upcoming album. "It really shows him off as an artist and a singer, which is what it was always going to be. I can't say too much about it as it's not my project, and I've got no idea when it's coming out. It's quality." 
 
  CEO   revealed earlier this month the release of Styles' album is not far off. The record label boss also stated the 23-year-old heartthrob is doing his label bosses proud with the tunes he's working on for his upcoming solo effort. 
 
 Music isn't the only thing Styles is working on - the star is also carving out an acting career for himself and will be seen in director Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated war movie ' ', which reaches US cinemas in July.
