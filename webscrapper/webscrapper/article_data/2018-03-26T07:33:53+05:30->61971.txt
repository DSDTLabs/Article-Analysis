BENGALURU: Motorists heading to the   (KIA) will have to   at the   from Monday midnight. The move is expected to hold up passengers on the way to the airport in long queues at the plaza.

 Currently, motorists pay a cumulative toll fee for journeys to and from the airport when driving to the city. Under the new system, motorists will be paying one-way toll on their outward or return trips, or choose to pay on the first trip. The cumulative toll fee is valid for 24 hours.
 
 The move to collect toll in both directions comes in the wake of the opening of a second route to the airport via Hennur, which seems to have cut into the toll revenue at Sadahalli plaza.
 
 Light motor vehicles can pay the cumulative fee of Rs 125 in the first trip itself so that they wonâ€™t have to pay on their way back. Else, they can just pay Rs 85 for that particular trip.
