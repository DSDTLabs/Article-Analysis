BENGALURU:   rattled the England batsman with an astounding six-wicket haul as India clinched the T20 series too, prevailing across formats over England.

 Chahal's heroics - which came after Suresh Raina (63) and MS Dhoni (56) had launched a classic rescue act in the third T20 to take India to 202 - enabled the hosts to hand out a 75run thrashing to  's men at the M Chinnaswamy stadium.
 
 England were looking set to chase down the target at the high-scoring venue, with Joe Root (42) and Eoin Morgan (40) adding 64 runs. But they dramatically lost their grip after the fall of Morgan in the 13th over and lost eight wickets for eight runs, the second-worst collapse ever in international cricket. Coming in for his second spell after removing Sam Billings in his first over,   dismissed Morgan and Joe Root off successive deliveries to leave the visitors reeling at 1194. He then bagged three more, removing  , Ben Stokes and Chris Jordan to take India close to victory. Towards the end pacer Jasprit Bumrah (3-14) cleaned up the tail.
 
 Earlier, a brilliant display of batting from the old guard of Raina (63) and Dhoni (56) helped India overcome an opening meltdown. After winning the toss and opting to bowl, England had India in trouble after removing openers   and KL Rahul (22) within the first eight overs. Raina and Dhoni rebuilt the innings from 652.
 
 Raina proved his worth with a fine innings to bring up his fourth T20I fifty. Dropped at 47 by bowler Adil Rashid, Raina achieved the milestone hitting the leg-spinner for two sixes, having added 61 runs with Rahul and 55 with Dhoni.
 
 Dhoni came up with some lusty blows in the company of   (27) to notch up his maiden half-century in T20Is. His 57-runs stand with Yuvraj ended when he top-edged Rashid only to be caught by Jordan at fine leg.
