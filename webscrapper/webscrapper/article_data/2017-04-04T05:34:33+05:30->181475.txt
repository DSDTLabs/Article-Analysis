 One such case came to light at Pilibanga community health centre (CHC) in Hanumangarh district, which is run by only one doctor, who is also the block chief medical officer and incharge of the CHC. 
 
 At Pilibanga CHC, three doctors were found remaining absent for a long time affecting health services.
 
 Taking strict action, Hanumangarh chief medical health officer has relieved three doctors for not reporting to duty at a community health centre for a long time. “They were not coming to the CHC for a long time. Neither they resigned nor they replied to the notices sent by us asking them to join the duties,” chief medical health officer (Hanumangarh) Dr Preet Mohinder Singh said.
 
 He said that there are four sanctioned posts of doctors in Pilibanga CHC, but three doctors remained absent for a long time. “One of them is not coming to the CHC for over a year. I had to take the strict step to relieve them to vacate the posts so that I can get other doctors posted here for the benefit of patients,” Dr Singh said.
 
 “One of the doctors got married and never returned. She has not even resigned from the post nor replied to our notices,” Dr Singh said, adding that now as they have been relieved from Pilibanga CHC, it is upto the health directorate to take up the matter regarding their postings. 
 
 To ensure that health services are unaffected, the authorities have deployed a doctor on temporary basis for the short-staffed Pilibanga CHC.
 
 Meanwhile, the health authorities in Jaipur are also taking the long absenteeism of doctors in rural areas seriously.
