SECUNDERABAD: The   (SCB) has finally launched work on developing parks in vacant parcels of land in the cantonment limit. It is also constructing mini community halls in different residential colonies to enable the locals hold their family or community functions.

 The parks are coming up on `gifted' vacant plots in various localities. Under the Cantonment Act, commercial builders need to `gift' 40 per cent of the total land parcel to the cantonment board for development of parks, playgrounds and community halls. The new parks will have facilities like walkways, landscaped greenery , play equipment for children, and wash rooms. A few parks are ready for inauguration. They include the parks at Akash Nagar, Jaya Nagar, BHEL Colony, Sri Malani Colony , Aruna Colony , Ravi Colony, Gruhalakshmi Colony and   .
 
 The mini community halls under construction will also be utilised for events like birthday cele brations and monthly meetings of the local residential colony association. The mini halls at Soujanya Colony , Bapuji Nagar and Netaji Nagar are ready for occupation.
 
 “We have speeded up work on parks, playgrounds and mini community halls to prevent encroachments.Each land parcel is worth several crores. A few plots have been encroached upon by land sharks. The plot size ranges from 300 sq yards to two acres. The SCB has about 100 acres of `gifted' land.But at present, only 90 acres is free from encroachments,“ an official in the SCB engineering wing told TOI. The board has earmarked about `10 lakh per park.Once a park is developed, it will be handed over to the local residential association for maintenance.
 
 The SCB has earmarked 80 plots for development of parks. It has constructed compound wall around the vacant plots to prevent illegal occupation. SCB CEO SVR   said, “The board decided to develop parks with its own funds. We are developing two major parks, apart from several mini parks“.
