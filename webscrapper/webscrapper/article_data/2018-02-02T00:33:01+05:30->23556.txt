Chennai: The city police, who busted a fake currency racket and arrested gun-carrying men from Guwahati Express at Thiruvottiyur last Friday, have transferred the case to the CB-CID police on instructions from DGP T K Rajendran.  The city police had seized five pistols and Rs 4 lakh fake currency in denominations of Rs 2,000 from two men named Kamal and Pradeep who were travelling from Bengal. The CB-CID has a specialised wing to handle fake currency cases. A senior police officer said the duo had acted on the direction of a prisoner in Puzhal, who was involved in fake currency pushing. He will soon be interrogated in custody. A day after the arrest of the duo, the Tiruchi police nabbed three people including a police head constable attached to Basin Bridge police station in Chennai for smuggling two country-made pistols and some fake currency notes from them. This case will also be transferred to the CB-CID.  “The Trichy police commissioner has recommended to the DGP that the case be transferred to the CB-CID,” a police officer said.
