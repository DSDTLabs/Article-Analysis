Actress   said no one can escape her   co-star  's "incredible charisma".

  
  
 "It was wonderful working with Dwayne because he has such incredible charisma. His million-watt smile lights up an entire room," Harris said in a statement. "You can't help but be charmed and moved by it. Dwayne brings such commitment to the set that it changes the energy there. Everybody's spirit is lifted. That was delightful to see," she added. 
 
 Based on the classic 1980s video game of the same title, the film is about a gorilla (Jason Liles), a crocodile and a wolf that terrorise a city. Johnson, who plays primatologist Davis Okoye, is the only one who can stop them. The   Pictures project will release in India on Friday in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. 
 
 Harris said she is not "used to working against green screen, so that was a huge challenge". "I'm grateful to have had Dwayne with me. Dwayne is the best at that kind of thing, and he was an expert guide through that experience," she added.
