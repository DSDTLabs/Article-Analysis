NEW DELHI: With the Indian cricket board ( ) doing little for developing the infrastructure of the game for over three years now,   (NCA) chairman   has got into a tiff with acting secretary   over  .

 Shah, who is disqualified as an office-bearer as per Lodha recommendations, has written to Choudhary citing that the board has kept a lot of issues pending pertaining to the NCA and questioned the appointment of NCA's chief operating officer (COO) Tufan Joshi.
 
 "BCCI has intentionally avoided inviting me to chair recent meetings of NCA and some important decisions have been taken in my absence, including appointing   as COO," Shah wrote. Ghosh assumed office on January 2. Ghosh's appointment has put an uncertainty on former India captain  's role as the director of NCA.
 
 "I request BCCI to call a meeting of NCA as I, thechairman of NCA, feelthat there is urgent need to review some of the decisions taken in recent meetings and also address all pending issues," the letter stated.
 
 NCA has been left unattended and several programmes are not being monitored.
 
 Shah also wrote that the board has invited chairmen of committees and sub-committees, including  , to chair meetings despite those officials being disqualified as office-bearers of state associations. The letter comes just days after Choudhary and BCCI CEO   announced Afghanistan's inaugural Test against India to be held in Bengaluru in June. Senior functionaries claimed the duo didn't keep them in the loop.
