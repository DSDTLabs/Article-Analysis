BHOPAL: The change in   dates by the MPPSC, from February 10 to February 12 has not gone down well with candidates who are complaining about other important exams like GATE, MPKVVCL, and Civil Judge scheduled to be held on that very date. The clash of dates would mean a missed opportunity to appear for those exams. 

 While initially finalising the exam date, MPPSC had selected February 10, since it was a holiday due to Guru  . However, a fresh date was announced after both students and teachers approached the commission. However, the change triggered this new issue of clashing exam dates.
 
 "I have to appear in an important exam to be conducted by MP   (MPKVVCL). Besides that, I have also been selected for civil judge exam Now, I am in a dilemma as to which exam to appear for," said a candidate.
 
 Interestingly, the previous date to organise the   was fixed at January 15 but it was later changed. Candidates, who had registered for both exams by paying a high amount, are now in a fix as the fee amounts for each of the exams have been substantial. GATE fee was Rs 1500, MPKVVCL fee was Rs 3000 and for civil judge it was Rs 1000.
 
 A candidate, saying that said clashing of exams is a sheer wastage of time and study, said, " A student puts in a lot of hard work and preparation for state civil services exam. After so much of hard work, it is extremely disheartening to know that appearing in PSC will come at a high cost as it clashes with other important exams".
