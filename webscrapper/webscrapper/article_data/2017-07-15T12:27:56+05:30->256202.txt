AMRITSAR: In perhaps the first case of its kind in  , two groups of men belonging to the Congress and   allegedly threw acid on one another to avenge what they called “political excesses of the past”. As many as five people received minor burn injuries in the clash that took place on Friday.

 Police officials said that they had often come across jilted lovers throwing acid on the girl who spurned them, but this was the first time that acid was used as a weapon in a political clash.
 
 Rachpal Singh, an Akali Dal member, alleged that he was sitting in his dairy office at   village on Friday when Sukhbir Singh, a Congress member, threatened him over the phone. “You have ruled for 10 years, now it is my government and I will give you a taste of the excesses done by you,” Sukhbir allegedly told Rachpal.
 
 A little later, some men came to his dairy and one of them, Bikram Singh, threatened Rachpal and his men with dire consequences. In the meanwhile, Sukhbir allegedly threw acid on his arm and stomach. Another person allegedly started thrashing Rachpal and his brother Baljinder with a stick. Rachpal alleged that the attackers threw acid on Baljinder while his cousin Bachitar Singh was hit on the head.
 
 Police officials told TOI that Rachpal’s men and relatives also threw acid on the rival group which left Bikram and another person injured. Cross FIRs have been registered which include charges of attempt to murder, throwing acid, voluntarily causing hurt and unlawful assembly.
 
 Senior superintendent of police, Amritsar rural, Parampal Singh said that guards have been deployed at the hospital where the injured have been admitted to avoid another attack.
 
 This is, of course, not the first political brawl between Congress and Akali Dal workers since March. Just two days after election results were declared an Akali worker was allegedly shot dead by his political rivals. Again on March 17 a Congressman was injured at Agwan village near   in a clash.
