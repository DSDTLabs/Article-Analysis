GURUGRAM: Humane Society International ( ), India, has announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for any information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of persons responsible for the killing of 12   in DLF I. The declaration came after bodies of 12 puppies were recovered from a vacant plot in the area on March 13. The puppies were allegedly killed by smashing their heads with bricks. 

 On March 13, Malvika Khatri of DLF I contacted NGO Walk for Animals and Habitat to inform about the disappearance of puppies from the area. The crime came to light after Amita Singh, president of the NGO, lodged a complaint with the police. An FIR was filed against unidentified persons under sections 11(1) of the Prevention of Animal Cruelty Act and 429 (mischief by maiming or killing cattle) of IPC at DLF I police station.
 
 “The sheer thought of killing any living being in this manner is shocking and these were innocent puppies. We have been raising the issue of stricter punishment for animal abusers because we are witnessing a rise in such crimes. We request citizens to discourage animal cruelty and report any abusive behavior against animals. Animal abusers have no empathy and there are studies to prove that they have a strong tendency towards violence and pose a risk to society. We hope that this reward urges anybody with any information about this crime to talk to us. We must ensure that justice is served,” said N G Jayasimha, managing director of HSI, India. Anyone with information can call the HSI/India helpline: +91 8899117773. 
 
 In the past, HSI, India, has played a role in identification of culprits involved in the Kerala dog bestiality case, the Green Park dog stabbing case and the incident where puppies were burnt alive in Hyderabad. “After the postmortem, we sent viscera for examination to FSL, Madhuban. We are waiting for the report and action will be taken as per law,” said Kailash Devi, SHO, DLF-I police station.
