MUMBAI: In a case of security breach, Sahar police arrested a 52-year-old businessman from   on Sunday for allegedly entering international airport premises without a valid flight ticket. 

 Zoyeb Ali Mithawala, who had gone to the airport to see off his in-laws, reportedly showed his passport and an e-ticket on his mobile phone to gain access to the T2 terminal. Mithawala was caught when he tried to walk out of the terminal from the entry point.   (CISF) officials questioned him and reportedly learned that he had "cancelled" his ticket at the last moment. 
 
 "Mithawala gained access to the premises by showing that he was flying to Dubai along with his relatives. But CISF personnel positioned at the entry gate got suspicious when they saw him walking back alone, without being accompanied by an airline staffer, which is mandatory when a flyer is either deported or offloaded. This raised our suspicions," said Sahar police senior inspector B T Mukhedkar.
 
 Mithawala said he had planned to travel to Dubai along with his in-laws. "He claimed to have cancelled his ticket at the last moment. But he decided to see off his in-laws and carried his passport along with him for the purpose," said investigators.
 
 "Mithawala said his intention was not cheat anyone and that he was supposed to fly, though he had cancelled his ticket. He thought he could gain easy access using the e-ticket," said the investigators. A CISF spokesperson at the international airport confirmed the offence. He has been booked under IPC Section 420 for cheating. He was produced before the Bandra holiday court on Sunday and remanded in police custody for a day.
