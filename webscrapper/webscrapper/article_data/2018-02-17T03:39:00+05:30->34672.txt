Panaji: On the controversy created by M F Hussain’s art concerning Hindu deities, Patwardhan said Hussain’s intention was “not just misunderstood but intentionally provoked and spread for political reasons”. 

 “He was painting images of Hanuman, Ravan and Ramayan for the Ramlila. The Ramlila committees were commissioning   to paint and illustrate their books and all these elements show that Hussain was deeply immersed in Indian culture, Indian tradition and in Indian art,” he said. tnn
