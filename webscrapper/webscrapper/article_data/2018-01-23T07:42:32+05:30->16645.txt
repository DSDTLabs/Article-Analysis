HYD ERABAD: The   (GHMC) kicked off its crackdown against illegal hoardings in the city on Monday by removing four hoardings. These include a hoarding at   opposite Lifestyle building, one at   in  , another at   on   and one in GHMC South Zone.

 There are 333 illegal hoardings in the GHMC limits, most of which are atop private buildings, and the drive will continue till all of them are removed, civic officials said. “Removal of hoardings is a continuous process and we will continue it till all of them have been pulled down,” said Adwait Kumar Singh, additional commissioner of the advertisement department at GHMC.
 
 The job has been entrusted to a private agency that has put four teams of 10 people each on the job. “Removing one hoarding takes hours as it’s a huge structure. Each nut and bolt has to be removed carefully to prevent accidents,” said a top GHMC official.
 
  
 GHMC will also be earning from this process, with the agency that has been awarded the job paying the civic body ₹12.65 per kg of iron pulled down. The hoarding removal is being supervised by GHMC’s advertisement engineer (AE) of that particular area. The AE has been instructed to monitor daily the work being undertaken by the private agency, record the removal process with the help of the chief PRO and ensure completion of work as per schedule.
 
 The AE has been instructed to inform local police station about removal process and take police assistance, if necessary. “They can lodge a complaint in local police station in case any organisation or individual hinders the removal process,” said a GHMC official.
