PUNE: The FDA has decided to initiate stringent checks on the use of   in hospitals in Maharashtra.

 The decision follows several complaints by patients and their relatives that disposables like catheters, guide wires and balloons used in every   were reused and billed repeatedly in many private hospitals. 
 
 “We have got several complaints regarding hospitals reusing disposables and billing patients. This is completely unacceptable. We will soon initiate an inspection of state’s private hospitals to check their inventory of disposables and assess if they are reusing the same and billing patients for it,” state FDA commissioner   told TOI.
 
 The practice is so rampant that the Union health ministry has also issued an office memorandum warning against the reuse of disposable surgical item. “The disposable items after one procedure are sterilised and reused and (patients) are charged full amount for these items,” stated the memo dated December 21, 2016. The matter had been “viewed by this ministry seriously”, it said, and clarified that “reuse of disposable items, particularly in cardiology, is not permitted in hospitals empanelled under CGHS ( ).”
 
 It warns of ‘action including withdrawal of CGHS empanelment’ against defaulters. The memo, however, did not talk about action against big hospitals that are not empanelled under CGHS.
 
 Doctors and activists in Pune, however, say big private hospitals would not stoop so low to reuse disposables. “I don’t think big hospitals in Pune will be reusing disposables. However, it cannot be ruled out that they (disposables) may be reused in small hospitals equipped with cath-labs that operate on the city’s peripheries,” said cardiologist Abhijit Vaidya.
 
 Activist   said, “A little strengthening of surveillance makes things fall in place. Nobody can firmly say that there is not a single hospital in Pune that does not reuse disposables.”
