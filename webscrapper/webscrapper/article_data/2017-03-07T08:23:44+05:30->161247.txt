CHENNAI: With its space in the Dravidian political landscape shrinking, the Tamil Nadu unit of the   may soon face an existential crisis. Troubled by infighting and facing a perpetual leadership issue, the state unit of the Congress, which dominated the politics of the region pre and post-Independence, is now a weakened organization, riding piggy back on Dravidian parties for survival. TN is the only state where the party has been out of power for five decades. State Congress leaders boast of their rich legacy and the golden rule of their late leader  , who was chief minister of Tamil Nadu for three terms from 1954. “It was Kamaraj as CM who introduced the free noon meal scheme and ushered in the education and industrial revolution in Tamil Nadu. This is the legacy we have,“ said C R Kesavan, trustee of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee. Even Dravidian icon Periyar famously said, 'don't let go of Kamaraj, only he can save Tamil Nadu'.

 But, the party allowed Dravidian majors   and DMK to hijack the secular plank that had helped it build a sizeable support base.It allowed the two parties to author a poll formula that ensured that Congress remained a minor partner in the assembly elections, while appeasing it with a larger chunk of seats in the   elections.
 
 With consistent erosion of its support base -Congress has just eight legislators in the current Tamil Nadu assembly ­and outshone by its electoral partner DMK, its future appears rather bleak in the state.
 
 But, Kesavan disagrees. “The future of Congress looks bright. This is an inflection point in Tamil Nadu history. The younger generation wants a progressive alternative. We are in coalition with DMK. There is no change in that. But, it is the innate aspiration of any national party to do well and come to power to serve our people," said Kesavan.
