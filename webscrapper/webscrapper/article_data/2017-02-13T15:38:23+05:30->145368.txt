Akshaya Naik, popularly known as Ananya from   is a young, chirpy and talented actor who not only acts effortlessly, but is also a dancer and a voice artist.
 
  This young and successful actress recently got a photo shoot done where she beautifully portrayed a Bengali woman. With the red and white sari, Akshaya looks mesmerizing.
  
  However, through her success story, Akshaya wants to spread a bigger message. In this generation, curvy women are usually looked down upon, and the roles that they get are in the stereotypical 'fat friend' category.
  
  Wanting to break this stereotype, Akshaya also took part in the Miss Navi Mumbai pageant, where she won the title of the first runner up. She recently took to Instagram to pour her heart out about Body-Shaming. This is what the message reads:
  
  
  
  
  "We, as women, need to get out of this entire nutshell of being PERFECT ! Unfortunately, PERFECT has always been portrayed to be fair, slim, wearing fully covered clothes, well-mannered and obedient. Well, we need to overcome this. As long as you love yourself, you are PERFECT and noone has the right to destroy your self-confidence to be WHO YOU ARE. Thin, fat, fair, dark, tall, short - you are BEAUTIFUL üíùüë∏ I dedicate this picture to all those who have made fun of my chubbiness since childhood and specially in my college days. Who said, "You'll burst if you eat a grain more, because you're bloating like a BALLOON." GO AHEAD, and say more. You have given me more courage to accept myself and love my body.
  Be the QUEEN üë∏ of your life and let noone conquer you.
  PS : Flaunt your curves with all the grace üòç

  You inspire us all, Akshaya.
