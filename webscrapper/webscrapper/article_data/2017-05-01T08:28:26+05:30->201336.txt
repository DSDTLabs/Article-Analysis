LUCKNOW: Patient-care services at   in   will not be affected during its transfer from   to SGPGI. 

 KGMU has been asked to continue to provide patient-care services in trauma centre-2 till SGPGI is able to recruit staff for the purpose. A fully functional casualty ward, intensive care unit, x-ray unit and operation theatre are manned by staff and doctors from KGMU. 
 
 Ordering this after an inspection of trauma centre-2 on Sunday, additional chief secretary medical education   fixed a deadline of three months to finalise the transfer. 
 
 Trauma centre-2 was originally a project of SGPGI but handed over to KGMU by the   government. The decision was overruled by Yogi Aditya Nath two weeks ago.
