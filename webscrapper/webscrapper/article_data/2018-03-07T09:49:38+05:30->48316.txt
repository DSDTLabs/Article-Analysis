Pune: The moment of reckoning for   has finally arrived as they host   in their biggest game ever in the form of an   semifinal first leg at the   here on Wednesday.

 
 The league clashes between these two sides ended in a 3-1 win for the visitors at Balewadi and a 1-1 draw at the Sree Kanteerava stadium in Bengaluru.
 
 The Stallions will have the talismanic Marcelinho back after he missed the 2-2 draw against Delhi Dynamos through suspension. Coach Ranko Popovic has no injuries to contend with and will have a full squad available for selection.
 
 “In this type of game, we have to avoid making mistakes as there would be no further opportunity to correct them. We have come this far but we hope can take one or two more steps otherwise it would all be for nothing,” said Popovic.
 
 “Even before the league started, everyone knew Bengaluru had the best team and they have proved it by winning the league stage. But we have the balance in our team to make this match interesting,” he added.
 
 Bengaluru FC finished eight points clear of second-placed Chennaiyin FC and their strength in depth has been there for all to see. Fielding second-string teams in their AFC Cup qualification matches and selling their most creative player Edu Garcia (5 assists) seems to have had no effect whatsoever on the two-time I-League champions who have been as firm favourites to win this tie and the   title as well.
 
 But assistant coach Naushad Moosa has dismissed the favourites tag by asserting that his team will be focused on the task at hand.
 
 “The message from our head coach (Albert Roca) was clear, ‘Be humble, have a good game and the results will follow.’ This philosophy has gotten us to where we are and we will continue in the same vein,” he said.
 
 The Blues also do not have any injury concerns.
