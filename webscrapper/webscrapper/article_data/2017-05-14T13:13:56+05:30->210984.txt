After a series of intense performances, actor   had fun doing back-to-back romantic comedies in 'Behen  ' and 'Bareilly Ki Barfi'. 

 "'Trapped' did take a mental and physical toll on me. It was a very taxing film to do. While ' ' and 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' are fun films. But my commitment towards my work is the same. I had to learn the accent, work on the character but it was all fun this time," Rajkummar said. 
 
  
  
 The 32-year-old   said it was not a conscious decision to enter the mainstream commercial space. "I feel fortunate and lucky that people are thinking of me in each and every genre. 'Behen Hogi Teri' and 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' are wonderful stories and I have good roles in both the films," he said. 
 
 The actor said he is getting encouraging comments from industry people. "They are happy to see me in this avatar and they are saying I should do this often. But I don't have any plan... I do the work that I like." In Ajay Pannalal's 'Behen Hogi Teri', Rajkummar is paired opposite Shruti Haasan and the film is set to release on June 2. 
 
 Ashwiny Iyer-directed 'Bareilly Ki Barfi' features him along with Ayushmann Kurrana and Kriti Sanon and it will release on July 21.
