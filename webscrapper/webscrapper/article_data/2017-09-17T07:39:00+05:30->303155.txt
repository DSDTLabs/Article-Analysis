Chandigarh: Former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, on Saturday, accused the ruling Congress government of failing on all fronts in its six months of power. He said there is no reason for people to vote for the Congress in the forthcoming Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll on October 11. The five-time chief minister accused the Congress of cheating farmers, deceiving youths and failing to protect the religious sentiments of Punjabis.

 “The Congress government has also played a cruel joke on the industry by announcing power to it at rate of Rs five per unit but not implementing this decision. Nothing is sacrosanct for this government. It announced in the Vidhan Sabha that farmers’ loans had been waived off. However, loan of not even one farmer out of the accumulated Rs 90,000 crore loan amount has been waived. The government even announced that farmers would not be subject to kurki but it has not amended the land revenue act to make this a reality,” he said.
