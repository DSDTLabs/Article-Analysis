According to the latest reports, Jr NTR will be seen romancing   in his upcoming film â€˜Jai Lava Kusa' in which Tarak will be seen essaying three different roles. 
Bobby is directing the actor for the first time in this movie produced by Tarak's brother, actor Nandamuri Kalyan Ram on their home banner.
 While we already know that   will be one among the three actresses to star alongside the actor, actress Samantha joined the team as another female lead.
 Owing to the fact that industry currently is lacking good number of new glamorous heroines, actress Samantha was the only choice left while her peers   among others is already hands full. Newbies like Anuapama Parameswarana and Keerthy Suresh are only opting for roles that would not demand much of a skin show. Lavanya Tripathi and Hebah Patel are still working towards reaching the top stars ladder. For the reason of being not glamorous enough, Anupama was replaced by Samantha in Ram Charan-Sukumar's movie that went on floors recently.
 Also, it is worth mentioning that Samantha and Jr NTR have sizzled together in several movies - 'Brundavanam', 'Ramaiah Vastavyya', 'Rabhasa' and 'Janata Garage' before. Owing to the applause the couple garnered, the makers of the movie might have zeroed in on Samantha, making the movie ' ' as their fifth collaboration.
