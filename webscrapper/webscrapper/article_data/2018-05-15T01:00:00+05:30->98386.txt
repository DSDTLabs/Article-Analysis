Rohan Mehra, one of television’s popular ‘chocolate boys’, is eager to change his image. The actor, last seen on TV show ' ' ('SSK'), utilised his two-month break from work, after his show ended, to acquire a more muscular and rugged look.

 He says, “I was only being offered chocolate-boy characters, but as an actor, I want to explore various roles and genres and hence, the transformation. I am ready to go bare if the need arises. I have been wanting to do it for quite some time, but couldn’t, as I was working without a break. I hit the gym a day after 'SSK' ended, and was so focussed that I stopped meeting friends. I even moved to Lokhandwala from Goregaon to be close to the gym and trainer.”
 
 Rohan adds, “I have survived on boiled vegetables and eggs and don’t mind keeping off my favourite food for as long as it takes me to reach my goal.”
