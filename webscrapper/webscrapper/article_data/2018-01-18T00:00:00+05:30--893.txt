Asunny winter afternoon provided a perfect setting for the ladies to enjoy a Christmas bash. Hosted by Urban Swag club, the entire venue was done up in white, which was the colour code of the event. White balloons and props like the snowman and   gave several clicking options to the ladies.
Several games played on the occasion added to the fun. Passing the hoopla ring turned out to be an interesting game in which Payal Kapoor, Reena Peshwani and   were declared the winners. The greatest noise was made in a relay race in which the ladies had to put a ball in the bucket while walking briskly. Displaying their sporty side, Reena Peshwani, Nancy Batra and Manisha Mandan turned out to be the winners. 
 The champions trophy was given to Reena by Pooja Madhok, president of the club, for winning the highest number of games on the occasion.
