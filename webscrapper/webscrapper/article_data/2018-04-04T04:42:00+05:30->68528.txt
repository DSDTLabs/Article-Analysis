Ahmedabad: Congress MLAs have demanded the immediate intervention of governor O P Kohli, to secure justice for Dalits in the state and the country.

 Congress MLAs, in a memorandum presented to the governor, stated that the Supreme Court judgment comes at a time when Dalits in the country are in distress and many families are devastated because of atrocities in the country. According to the latest figures of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a crime is committed against a Dalit every 15 minutes and six Dalit women are raped every day. The number of rapes of Dalit women have doubled from 2007 to 2017. There has been a 66% rise in atrocities against Dalits in 10 years. This situation has only worsened over the last 3-4 years, under the present government at the Centre.
 
 The memorandum states: “It is quite surprising that instead of fighting for the rights of Dalits, the Centre submitted that anticipatory bail should be allowed in cases of atrocities against Dalits, if no prima facie case was made out. This shows the double-faced character of the Union government led by the BJP.
 
 The memorandum adds that NCRB’s 2016 report stated that conviction rates in crimes against Dalits are very low. In Andhra Pradesh, it is as low as 3%. In Himachal Pradesh it is 3.2%, in Odisha 3.3%, Telangana 6.5% and in Tamil Nadu it is 7.7%.
 
 The number of cases registered for atrocities against Dalits is just a fraction of the actual number, as many of these crimes go unreported due to non-cooperation at police stations, shame, social stigma, fear of retaliation by upper castes and other reasons, the memorandum stated. 
 
 Atrocities against Dalits are not restricted to a particular state and have assumed a national character. This coupled with the apex court judgment shall further lead to an increase in atrocities against Dalits.
