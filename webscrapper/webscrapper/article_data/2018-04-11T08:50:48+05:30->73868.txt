BHOPAL: After government  , now municpal staff are poised to get the benefits of seventh  . The urban development and housing department issued order to this effect, which comes with strings attached to it.

 The benefits will come the employees’ way, if they are able to keep establishment cost of the total revenue in check and pass a resolution to this effect at general council meet.
 
 The move is to benefit 60,000 employees in some 380 municipal bodies of the state. As per section 58 of the MP Municipal Corporation Act 1956, the establishment cost of municipal body after giving benefit of seventh pay commission should be less than 55% of the revenue. Similarly, as per section 94 of the MP Municipal Council Act 1961, establishment cost after benefits of seventh pay commission should be within 60% of the revenue.
 
 Establishment cost in both cases should be cut down by 5% in next three years, the order stated. The conditions are for employees appointed by municipal corporation and municipalities. While there will be no such condition for employees of state municipal services or state government employees working with civic bodies on deputation. 
 
 In case the above conditions are not met, the decision to give benefit of seventh pay commission would depend on approval from the general administration department committee, the order stated.
 
 Officials summed it up saying if municipal officials and employees want benefit of seventh pay commission, they will have to increase revenue collection as the government won’t bear additional cost.
 
 Issue of extending benefits of seventh pay commission is pending for some time now. When the finance department issued orders of extending benefits of the seventh pay commission to government employees, employees of municipal bodies were not counted in.
 
 In his budget speech, the finance minister announced to give benefits after which orders were issued after factoring conditionalities, officials said.
