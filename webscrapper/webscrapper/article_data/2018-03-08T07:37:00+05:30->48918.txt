CHANDIGARH: The   council of ministers on Wednesday approved the   2018-19 in order to overcome teachersâ€™ shortage in higher and senior secondary schools and for efficacious utilization of their services. The policy is aimed at removing the distinction among various categories of schools and teachers to be posted irrespective of the nature of schools.

 According to the new policy, the post of head teacher will only be created in primary schools if the number of students is more than 60. This is also aimed at motivating teachers to increase the strength of primary schools. Official figures reveal the teacher-student ratio at the state level in various cadres at 27 in primary schools, 22 for middle schools, 16 in high schools and 29 for senior secondary schools. Though the ratio is well within the norms but there is still shortage of teachers at both inter-district and intra-district levels.
 
 The new policy also makes it mandatory for school principals to take classes. Principals will have to take 12 periods per week and headmasters 15 per week. The new policy has increased the duration of class period from 35 minutes to 40 minutes. According to the policy, in case there are surplus teachers in the school, those having the longest stay will be shifted out to the common pool and all vacancies will be thus determined and put on the website. A seniority list of surplus teachers in a particular subject will also be prepared and they will be given a chance to opt for a school according to seniority.
 
 The new policy will ensure that teachers are posted irrespective of the nature of schools under the  , RMSA, model and Adarsh schools. Apart from this, services of about 1,500 surplus teachers will become available, which can be utilised by transferring them to requisite schools.
