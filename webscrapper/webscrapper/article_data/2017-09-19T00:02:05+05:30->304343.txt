MUMBAI:   and   drivers union called for flash strike in Mumbai from Monday midnight. There are around 30,000 cabs operating in Mumbai region. The impact of the strike, if any, will be visible only on Tuesday morning during the peak hour rush. 

 Majority of driver partners of Ola and Uber threatened a flash strike from midnight to demand better earnings and security of drivers who have been assaulted in the recent past, union sources said.
 
 "We are looking into the demands of drivers and have implemented policies to ensure their security and good earnings. We hope maximum driver partners stay on platform during morning peak hours," said sources in aggregator cabs.
 
 "We expect most drivers to go offline from midnight and this may lead to acute shortage of Ola and Uber cabs on Tuesday," said Yakub Mehta of Action Committee of Maharashtra.
 
 The strike may affect scores of commuters as they depend on these aggregator cabs for transport. It could also hit the aggregator cab business at the airports if driver partners go off the platform.
