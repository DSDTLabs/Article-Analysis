Panaji: A change in cinema is necessary if we want to have a radical film industry, said Bollywood film director Madhur Bhandarkar, known for his critically-acclaimed films ‘Chandni Bar’ and ‘Page 3’. He was speaking at the 64th National Award Winning Film Festival 2017 scheduled from May 18 to June 14. “This change will be brought in only when change the kind of films we create,” he said. “It’s very difficult to make a film, raise funds, distribute it. It is a great credibility to the writers, producers and directors of these films to make such great cinema worthy of winning National Awards,” he said. The festival is being organized by the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) in association with the directorate of film festivals at Maquinez Palace. It will feature 38 films in 13 Indian languages that have been recognized with significant awards. Actress Kirti Kulhari, known for her role in the 2016 release, Pink also inaugurated the event on Thursday. “To have these films screened under one roof is a great initiative. Just experiencing cinema from all over the country at this festival is a lovely opportunity to watch the diversity of Indian cinema,” she said. Tribute was paid to Bollywood actor Reema Lagoo, who passed away on Thursday, with a minute of silence. Besides an illustrious career in Hindi and Marathi cinema, she had also acted in Rajendra Talak’s Konkani film, ‘Sawariya.com’. The festival opened with Marathi films, ‘Kaasav’ (Turtle) which won the Swarna Kamal for best feature film and ‘Aaba Aiktaay Naa?’ (Father, are you listening?) which won the award for best direction in the non-feature film category at the National Awards this year. Directors and producers of Goa’s films that have won National Awards in the past five years were felicitated at the inaugural.
