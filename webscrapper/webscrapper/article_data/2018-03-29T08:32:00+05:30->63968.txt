NEW DELHI: An Air India Dreamliner was taken to the remote bay of the IGI airport after the airline received a   call in Mumbai on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The call, which was later declared to be a hoax, came when 248 passengers and 11 crew members had already boarded AI020 for its 2.25pm departure to Kolkata. The caller warned that the plane would be “blown mid-air”.
 
 “As per the standard operating procedure for security drill, the baggage loaded on that plane was offloaded for checking. The process took about two hours. Later, the security agencies also asked   to make passengers deboard as the plane needed to be taken to a remote bay for more checks,” said an AI official. 
 
 The pilot reportedly made an announcement that the flight had been “sabotaged” and the passengers were asked to leave it. After the passengers were offloaded with their hand baggage, a physical as well as scanning check of the flyers and their luggage was carried out, said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (IGI). Another aircraft was arranged and the Kolkata flight finally took off around 6pm. 
 
 Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials said they received a message from Mumbai around 2.45pm. “The caller said the plane would be blown off mid-air, following which the bomb threat assessment committee (BTAC) was alerted and the threat was declared specific,” said a senior CISF official. 
 
 CISF said the call was declared a hoax by the evening after nothing was discovered on-board.
 
 Confirming the incident, Delhi Police said a complaint had been registered in Mumbai following the threat call. “The call was received in an informative pattern at the   of Sutherland Global Services of Air India in Mumbai,” said DCP Bhatia. The police are trying to trace the call.
