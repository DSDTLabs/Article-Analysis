Mysuru: An 18-year-old girl, who was not allowed to leave her grandmother’s house in Mysuru where she was confined for the past one month, was rescued by the district police on Thursday.

 The girl, who was trapped inside the house in Kulya village in HD Kote taluk, sent an SOS message to the superintendent of police, Mysuru district, Ravi D Channannanavar seeking help. The SP immediately contacted police in HD Kote taluk, who rescued the girl with the aid of officials from the women and child welfare department.
 
 A native of KR   in Mandya, the girl was a first-year degree student. A member of an upper caste community, the girl is reportedly in love with a boy from another community, and was intent on marrying him. Her parents opposed the alliance and insisted her on marrying a boy from the same caste. But she told parents that she was not interested in entering into matrimony before completing her degree. Suspecting that she might elope with her lover, her parents sent the girl to her grandmother’s house in HD Kote, where she was held captive, in Mysuru.
 
 Coordinator of the Mahila Santwana Kendra, HD Kote   said that it was an SMS the girl sent to the SP that prompted them to act. “We summoned the girl’s parents to discuss the issue. But they refused to take her back. We have sent her to a government-run girl’s home,” said Jayasheela.
 
 “We will write to the women and child welfare department in Mandya, since the girl is a resident of that district. We will transfer the case soon,” Jayasheela told TOI.
 
 She confirmed that police had not lodged a case yet.
