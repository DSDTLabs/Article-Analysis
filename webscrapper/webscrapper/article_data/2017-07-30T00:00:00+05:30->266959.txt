No matter where we look, most people agree morning rituals can help create a happy life. There is one caveat though: there is no ‘one size fits all’ recipe that suits everyone. Looking at how busy our lives are becoming, however, there are a few things that could help us start the day right and feel better. I swear by these four hacks that help me manage two toddlers, a business, household duties and still go through the day with more energy. 

 
 Sit still and just breathe before you get up. If you are not into sitting still (some people truly can’t do this) – then try visualisation or affirmation. 
 
 
 Making your bed every morning is correlated with better productivity and stronger skills at sticking with a budget. 
 
 
 Even though you may not be a morning person, getting up a little earlier than usual is directly correlated to productivity and extra energy.
 
 
  What would make today great? The main premise of asking this question is to set the intention and then have a focus about what to do in a day.
