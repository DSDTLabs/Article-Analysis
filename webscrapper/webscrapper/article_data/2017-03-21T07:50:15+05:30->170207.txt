CHENNAI: Science streams appear to be falling out of favour as a career choice among next generation employees in the city. A   of 10,000 students from CBSE, ICSE and state board schools in Chennai showed that 60% of students felt that a non-science stream offered more scope. Preferred career fields included architecture, construction, banking and finance, media and entertainment, which students believe are emerging sectors.

 The survey conducted by  , a career guidance firm, revealed that 72% of the students felt that the lack of structured information on career choices was a challenge. A majority of youngsters felt that there was a greater need for a career counsellor during high school rather than relying on parents’ advice or peers when it came to career choices. This was a finding not just in Chennai but also two other other metro cities, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, where the survey was also conducted.
 
 A majority of students surveyed felt that the right time to plan their careers was during or before Class X while 23% said that it was better to make the choice after completing Class XII. Meanwhile, 21% felt the best time to pick their career paths was during their graduation years. A common thread in all the cities was that Gen Z is open to exploring career opportunities based more on their passion and strengths rather than earning big money or status in society.
 
 The survey was conducted to get a feel for the next generation’s career goals across the three cities with a total of 23,000 students from 329 schools participating.
