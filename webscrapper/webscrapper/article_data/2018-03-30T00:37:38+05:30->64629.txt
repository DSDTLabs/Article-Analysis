With two months for monsoon to set in, municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta has inspected several nullahs in the western suburbs this week. Mehta directed municipal officials to elevate the 57-inch   in   in   to enable quick discharge of water in the area. 

 On the Chamdawadi nullah, there are two culverts through which the pipeline passes. The pipeline obstructed the flow of water in the nullah, due to which nearby areas, including Jaibharat Society and Railway Colony, would get flooded in a downpour. Chamdawadi nullah is being widened as part of the pre-monsoon preparations. tnn
