CHENNAI: The police were as busy as ever in April — solving crimes, handling Cauvery protesters and providing security to VVIPs — but at least 500 personnel from the rank of superintendents of police to constables — are yet to receive their pay for the month.

 
 These are officers whose jobs the home department is yet to regularise and whose pay must receive sanction through a government order that is effective for a year. An administrative delay of 10 days in the submission of documents for the state to issue a fresh GO resulted in the salary of 500 police personnel being delayed for April, a police officer said. The department finally submitted the documents txo the government after April 10.
 
 The officers who have not received their pay for April are understandably peeved at the delay. They say such hold-ups have become routine during the first month of the financial year, the officer said.
 
 “The state and the administration should have put in a little effort to resolve this issue,” he said.
 
 A police officer in the DGP’s office said the department is likely to sort out the problem this week. “The file is marked ‘important’, so it is a priority,” he said, adding that various issues, including the Cauvery protests, had taken up the time of senior officers last month.
