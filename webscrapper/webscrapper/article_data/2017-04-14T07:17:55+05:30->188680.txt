VADODARA: As a second-year BSc student in  , she had no idea that she would go on to become national champion in shooting someday.

 But   KC recently went on to win eight medals in two major shooting championships held in Haryana. 
 
 Hema won four   medals in the 60th National Shooting Championship held from March 28 to April 5. 
 
 And then she went on to bag three gold medals and one silver in the Indo-Bhutan Shooting Championship that was played between April 6 and April 13. 
 
 “I am happy with my performance in both the shooting championships. I am glad I won seven gold medals and one silver,” Hema told TOI and went on to add that the Baroda Rifle Club and   Authority of   has been supporting her since she came to Gujarat two-and-half years ago. But she had never planned to become a professional shooter. 
 
 “I was in NCC and hence went to a shooting trial during my graduation. I performed well following which they asked me to compete professionally. And that’s how my journey into shooting sport began. I soon became a part of the national squad of NCC. It was all by destiny,” Hema, who got a job in the income tax department under the sports quota, said. 
 
 But the journey wasn’t that easy. “When I got selected for a national championship I was no longer with NCC. I didn’t have a rifle of my own and I had no idea about professional shooting. I even thought of quitting once. Fortunately, the NCC gave me an extension under a special provision and I went on to participate in national and international games later.” 
 
 She is now preparing to participate in the Grand Prix International Shooting Championship at Czech Republic.
