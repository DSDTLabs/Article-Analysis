CHENNAI: Civil work to modify   in polling stations will begin next week to make them disabled friendly for the RK Nagar by elections scheduled on April 12. 

 On Saturday, disability rights activists met returning officer   to submit an audit report on accessibility in the constituency, which they had undertaken across all the 51 polling stations comprising 256 booths. 
 
 The audit was to assess the present condition such as if roads leading to the station were barrier-free, if there were ramps at the entrance and if they were safe. Since this is the third consecutive year that the RK Nagar constituency is going to polls, a majority of locations have ramps, but half of the existing ramps are not of a standard gradient and hence unsafe according to the report. Activists who audited the places said that the ramps were steep and there were barriers, such as steps or sand, preventing a wheelchair user from mounting the ramp. 
 
 "Since the locations are the same, ramps are there but there are defects which we will correct and standardise all the ramps," said an assistant engineer. "Since this work is high priority and there is very little time, we won't be calling for tenders. By next Tuesday, we expect to complete all the civil work."
 
 The district election office is also awaiting instructions from the election commission to be able to station wheelchairs and rope in volunteers at polling stations.
 
  Apart from civil work, we have also requested for the entire election process to be made inclusive such as using sign language interpreters for systemic voters' education and electoral participation (SVEEP) activities, said Smitha Sadasivan, member of  , which is spearheading the audit.
