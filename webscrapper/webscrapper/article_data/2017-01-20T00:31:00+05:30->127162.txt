Bhopal: As part of the Congress’ nationwide protest against demonetisation,   party unit held a protest outside the Reserve Bank of India ( ) building here on Wednesday.

 The agitation was led by AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik, former Union minister Pallam Raju and PCC chief Arun Yadav. The   workers gathered at the BDA Square on Wednesday afternoon to voice their angst against demonetisation. They marched towards RBI building around 4 pm and submitted their memorandum to an RBI official after a mild scuffle with the police. Later, party workers started their march towards the chief minister’s official residence, but were arrested by the police and released later. Wasnik attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said, “No one has the right to arbitrarily make an announcement to withdraw currency.” He demanded RBI governor Urjit Patel’s resignation and claimed the Congress party will not rest till he steps down. Wasnik also asked the   to explain how many of its leaders have been caught with wads of new currency notes to the tune of lakhs and crores of rupees. Pallam Raju said the prime minister withdrew 86% of the nation’s currency in a single stroke without proper back-up plan and 10 weeks later, the RBI is still “groping in the dark”.
 
 PCC president Arun Yadav headed straight to the protest site after being discharged from a private city hospital. He was injured in a clash with the police during an NSUI demonstration against the Katni hawala scam. He could not stand to address his party workers, but spoke sitting on the dais. Raising the Katni hawala scam, Yadav said, “The Congress demands that minister of state Sanjay Pathak should be arrested and legal proceedings should be initiated against BJP state president Nandkumar Singh Chouhan and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. We demand a judicial probe into the issue and a trial under the supervision of the high court.” He said the Congress does not trust the CBI after the Vyapam investigations.
