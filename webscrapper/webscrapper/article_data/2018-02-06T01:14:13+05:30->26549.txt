MUMBAI: Even as the   has already been deemed passed in the civic body, the opposition has raised questions on why a rejected policy was given the nod.

 In a letter sent to mayor  ,   opposition leader   and NCP leader Rakhi Jadhav along with two other   members demanded an urgent BMC meeting to discuss the policy.
 
 The demand comes against the backdrop of a blaze at two rooftop restaurants in Kamala Mills that killed 14 people. “When the rooftop policy was tabled in the improvements committee earlier, it was rejected. The policy was then brought before the house for approval, but before there could be any discussion over it the same was sanctioned by the civic commissioner,” said Raja.
 
 In February 2015, the BJP-led civic improvements committee voted against the policy with the party terming it as being “against our culture”. 
 
 In May 2015, the policy was sent before the BMC house of corporators. As no decision was taken, last November the civic chief cleared it under powers conferred on him under Section 36 (2) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act.
