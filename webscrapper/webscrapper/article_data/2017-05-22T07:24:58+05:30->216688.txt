PUNE:   are hampering the city traffic   who jump signals at different chowks in the city. 

 The traffic police said that on many roads, either the white ‘stop lines’ are entirely missing or the zebra crossing is illegible and has faded over time. At some other places, the zebra crossing can be seen through naked eyed but not at the  .
 
 The traffic police department had conducted a survey earlier this month, which found that there were 82 such chowks or junctions in the city with illegible   or zebra crossings. According to the survey, a majority of such spots are located in Swargate (12), followed by Deccan (see box).
 
 Since March this year, the city traffic police has begun taking action against errant motorists with the help of CCTV cameras. 
 
 Two years ago, the state home department installed 1,230 CCTV cameras at different chowks and roads in the city. These cameras provide live feed to the control room at the office of the police commissioner. This feed is now being shared with the traffic police control room as a part of the exercise to curb traffic violations, and also to take action against violators.
