NEW DELHI: Airfares on the government’s subsidised regional flights will be revised every three months. The subsidy provided, accordingly, will also be changed. Fares of the “ude desh ka aam naagrik” or   will be linked to inflation and the viability gap funding (VGF) shall be decided by taking inflation, jet fuel cost and rupee-dollar exchange rate into account, the aviation ministry said while answering frequently asked questions about the scheme.

 The quarterly revision would “ensure that all the factors that impact the cost of operations of an airline are taken into consideration while determining VGF”. The scheme was kicked off recently with a fare cap of Rs 2,500 per hour of flying with half of the seats going for the subsidised fares. The   scheme has got its biggest boost with India’s largest airline by domestic market share, IndiGo, deciding to have turboprops in its fleet to fly on those routes.
 
 IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said that in support of PM Modi’s Udan scheme, the airline is “embarking on a journey to build a nation-wide regional network and connect cities that have not benefitted from the growth in Indian aviation.” IndiGo will bid for Udan flights. “…IndiGo plans to launch its turboprop operation at the end of calendar 2017 and expects to induct up to 20 ATR aircraft by December 2018,” the airline said.
 
 “The subsidised flying model for regional flights under Udan is something that no serious player can afford to remain out of by not having turboprops in its fleet. The   governments model makes it possible for airlines like IndiGo to do so and others will follow suit as IndiGo watches its bottomline like few others,” said an aviation industry insider.
