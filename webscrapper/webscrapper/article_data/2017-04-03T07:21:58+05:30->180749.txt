VADODARA: Students of M S University’s Faculty of Science are bearing the brunt of internal differences between dean of the faculty and the faculty’s staffers. 

 It has come to light that the faculty on Saturday goofed up in issuing question papers to   of semester 3 of MSc maths subject. Around 17 students were appearing for the exams at the faculty but when the   started it came to light that the faculty had only one question paper. 
 
 Later, the faculty issued the other question papers to students by getting the question paper photocopied at the faculty premises. Sources said that the goof up has its roots in the internal differences between the dean professor A C Sharma and some staffers who had entered into heated arguments on Friday. After the arguments, Sharma allegedly asked the staffers to stay away from exam duty. Because of this, the block list to get the question papers printed, did not reach the university press from where the question papers are printed. 
 
 Sources even suggest that because of the verbal fight, one staffer has also been transferred from the faculty to the university head office. Attempts to reach Sharma failed on Sunday.
