BENGALURU: The   near   has turned into a dumpyard, with piles of construction and household waste littering its banks. The lakebed is dotted with heaps of rocks, granite, bricks, plastic and what not.

 Residents alleged that tractors dump construction waste here on a regular basis. “If any building is demolished in the nearby area, all the debris is brought here and discarded. And this happens at least thrice a week,’’ rued  , a vendor.
 
 Pointing to the plastic packets and other household waste,  , who works nearby, said: “The waste generated at the nearby flats too also junked here. Boxes and sacks filled with household waste add to the mess.” 
 
 Naseema B, who has been living in the area for over 20 years, said the scenic waterbody lost its charm over the years. “Apart from being an eyesore, garbage heaps are posing severe health hazards. Filthy water enters the lake from the premises of industrial units which are located less than a kilometre away. The stench is unbearable,” she added. 
 
 According to environmentalist  , dumping of construction debris in and around lakes is the first step towards encroachment. “The lake dies over a period of time. The local population should stand united to prevent this happening to Kammasandra Lake,” he said.
