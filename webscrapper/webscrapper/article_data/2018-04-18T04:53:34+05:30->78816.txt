NEW DELHI:Stepping up its attack on  ,   said it was taking up the challenge posed by   seeking proof of any statement on “saffron terror” by arguing that his thinking reflected an “anti-Hindu” mindset. 

 
 BJP spokesman Sambit Patra showed a copy of a Wikileaks cable on a communication from the US embassy in India in 2009 that said “reaching out to Rahul Gandhi”. The confidential communication said: “Responding to the ambassador’s query about Lashkar-e-Taiba’s immediate threat to India, Gandhi said there was evidence of some support for it among certain elements of India’s Muslim community. 
 
 However, Rahul Gandhi warned that a bigger threat may be radicalised Hindu groups which create religious tensions and confrontations with the Muslim community.” The cable was sent by the then US ambassador Timothy Roemer. 
 
 The risk of a “homegrown” extremist front reacting to terror attacks from Pakistan was a growing concern and one that demanded constant attention, Patra quoted Rahul as saying in the cable. The BJP spokesperson said Rahul’s comments reflected a “hatred” for the Hindu community and these were indicative of how Congress thought. 
 
 The ambassador said, according to the cable, that “Gandhi was referring to tensions created by some of the more polarising figures in BJP, such as Gujarat CM Narendra Modi”. BJP said it had provided sufficient proof in response to Congress spokesman P L Punia’s statement demanding evidence in support of the claim that Rahul or any other leader had spoken of “saffron terror”. 
 
 Patra said the meeting was important and Rahul was seated next to the US ambassador at a meal held by the then Prime MInister  . “If Congress considers India to be its own, then   and Rahul Gandhi must apologise to the whole country for defaming the great Hindu religion,” Patra said.
