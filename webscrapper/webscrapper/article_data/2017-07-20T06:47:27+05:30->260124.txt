CHARMINAR: Unidentified persons have started construction at the Ashoorkhana Mir Qurban Ali without seeking permission from the state  . 

  "Waqf board has the legal backing required to stop constructions on that property but they still haven't taken any action regarding this," said Syed Altaf Hyder Razvi, a former MLC, and member of MIM. Razvi had written to the Waqf Board last Friday and demanded eviction of people he claimed are squatters. He also sought initiation of relevant legal proceedings against them. The Ashoorkhana - a structure of religious significance to the city's Shia community - lies on a property of around 358 square yards under the board's custody in Somajiguda. 
 
  "It is required by law to take the board's permission before doing anything on the land. Even the Ashoorkhana management itself cannot construct anything on that land without doing so," Razvi said. The former legislator said that the construction comes despite a recent ruling of the Telangana waqf tribunal which he claimed is in favour of the state waqf board. Encroachments on the property were first reported to the tribunal in 2007, with the tribunal's final verdict on the case coming out on the 4th of July. 
 
  When contacted,   chairman Mohammed Saleem told TOI to contact the chief executive officer M A Mannan Farooqui. However, the CEO remained unavaliable for comments.
