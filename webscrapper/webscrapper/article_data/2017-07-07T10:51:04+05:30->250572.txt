 The joint select committee held its first meeting on Thursday. "The bill could be beneficial for poor patients who go to private hospitals. But we need to ensure it doesn't get stuck in legal tangles. We decided to seek legal opinion and redraft the bill to ensure smooth implementation,'' Rajanna said .
 
  Rajanna said they're also looking into concerns raised by doctors working in private hospitals and engaged in private practice, especially the clause that stipulated imprisonment up to three years for those who violate provisions of the bill. The panel will look into doubts raised by members and recommend modifications to the bill, as directed by the speaker, within a month, he added.
