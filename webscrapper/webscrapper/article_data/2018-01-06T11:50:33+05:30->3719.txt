KANYAKUMARI: The team of 34 fishermen from   coastal village in Kanyakumari who went in search of fishermen from the village who are missing since Cyclone Ockhi have returned empty handed on Friday. 

 The team took this last bid to find out the missing fishermen with hope that they would be stranded in the deep sea. In six mechanised boats they left the   on December 29. 
 
 While eight boats had earlier gone in search of missing fishermen of the village from December 12 to 22 and returned with 22 stranded fishermen in two boats, these six boats went to areas not covered by the earlier team. Villagers said that 70 fishermen who went fishing in six boats from the village in the third and fourth week of November were missing, but the search team could not find any of those boats. 
 
 On Friday afternoon the search teams returned to Cochin. Further   would be known only when members of the search team return home.
