Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has asked its security agency to terminate the services of the five security guards who were involved in the attack on three persons on Saturday in Subhanpura during razing drive. The five guards had beaten up two men and manhandled a woman.

 The VMC had on Monday issued a notice to the security agency and had also sought explanations from two security personnel on VMC payrolls. It had come to light that all the five persons who were involved in the fracas were from the security agency. The decision to ensure that the five were not awarded any duties in the VMC was taken after orders by mayor Bharat Dangar.
 
 Dangar said that in the recent past, the VMC had conducted several razing drives with people’s cooperation. “We did not face any problems. This was the first time when such an incident took place. It is showing the civic body in a very bad light. I had asked officials to take immediate action against those involved in the incident,” said Dangar.
 
 Deputy municipal commissioner Prakash Solanki said that the security agency was asked to reply within three days and should furnish it reply soon. “After the instruction by the mayor, we have asked the agency to take the five security guards off duty. Their names are there in the FIR and they were also arrested making it sufficient ground to do so,” he said.
 
 On being asked why the security personnel of the private agency were not in uniform, Solanki said that it was another issue that needed to be examined. “The guards of the agency have to be in their uniform,” he said. He added that further action will be taken based on the reply of the agency.
