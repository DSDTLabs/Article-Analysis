 Rajkumar Das, a Dhanbad boy, is making a web series named The Reel and Real Life of Wasseypur, which will project the real environment of the locality.
 
 "I have been born and brought up in Dhanbad and my house is just next to Wasseypur. I want the world to know that Wasseypur is not associated with negativity. I am making these series to show the reality of the place to the world," Das said.
 
 He added, "People have a very negative idea about this place. We want to show them that Wasseypur may have some issues but it is not so brutal."
 
 The web series will have five episodes, each with a different story, based on various issues such as crime, addiction, marriage among others. The series is most likely to be uploaded by the end of April.
 
 Before starting this project, Rajkumar had earlier worked with a number of local albums before trying his luck in Mumbai. After going to Mumbai, he started his career as an assistant director of a daily soap  . Since then, he has worked on various ad films with stars like Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor and has also directed several short films and documentaries.
 
 Priya Mishra, the only actress in the series, also belongs to Jharkhand. Brought up in Jamshedpur, Mishra has been working closely with Rajkumar to bring the web series to life. 
 
 "Acting in this web series was a challenge as I had a different role in every episode and I had to prepare according to the character," she said.
