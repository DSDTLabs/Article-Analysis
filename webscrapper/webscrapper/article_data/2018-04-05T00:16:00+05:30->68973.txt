Pimpri Chinchwad: For the past few months, several autorickshaws have been ferrying between five to six passengers in Pimpri Chinchwad. 

 The commuters are at great risk and, in fact, minor accidents have also been reported. This despite autorickshaw unions stating that only three persons are allowed to travel in the vehicles. 
 
 Usually, two persons are seen sitting beside the driver, while up to four persons occupy the passengers’ seat. 
 
 The lack of adequate public transport facility is the root cause of the problem. If a passenger hails a rickshaw from Pimpri or Chinchwad railway stations or any of the major bus terminals, in most cases, the rickshaw drivers may charge exorbitant fares ranging from Rs150 to Rs300, depending on the distance to be covered.
 
 “The autorickshaw drivers are charging exorbitant fares. This must stop,” said commuter Pradip Thorat, who was travelling from Pimpri railway station to Sant Tukaramnagar and was charged Rs200.
 
 Baba Kamble, president, Maharashtra Rickshaw Panchayat, explained, “There are 15,000 autorickshaw drivers in Pimpri Chinchwad. The traffic policemen do not take action against them. There are also six-seater vehicles and jeeps that carry more than the sanctioned number of passengers.”
 
 Deputy commissioner of police Ashok Morale said, “Many rickshaws ply without meters. We have taken action against such drivers. If a driver harasses or refuses to ply, people should approach local traffic divisions. We will take stern action such drivers.”
