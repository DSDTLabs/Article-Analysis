AHMEDABAD:  , convener of OBC, SC, ST   and Gujarat Kshatriya Thakor Sena, on Sunday, said that his outfit will go to poll-bound Uttar Pradesh to expose alleged   of   (RSS).

 Thakor made the announcement in reaction to RSS spokesperson Manmohan Vaidya’s remarks in which Vaidya advocated review of the current caste-based reservation policy. While speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival on Friday, Vaidya had said that even Dr B R Ambedkar, architect of the Constitution, was not in favour of perpetual continuance of reservations, and the current reservation policy should be reviewed.
 
 Taking a dig at Vaidya’s remarks, Thakor said, “BJP and its ideologue should make it clear whether they want reservation to exist or not. We cannot bear any anti-reservation remarks, because many downtrodden communities could achieve a better life with the quota system.”
 
 “We will not take this lightly and will launch a stir in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh to expose the BJP and its mother organization RS,” Thakor added.
 
 On Saturday, over 100 members of Thakor’s organization were detained when protesting against Vaidya’s remarks.
