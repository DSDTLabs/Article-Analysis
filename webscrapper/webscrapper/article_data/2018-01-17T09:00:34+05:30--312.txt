KRISHNAGIRI: Deputy coordinator of AIADMK K P Munusamy warned V K Sasikala’s husband M Natarajan not to blemish the late chief minister Jayalalithaa’s fame and her achievements. “He will face dire consequences if he continued to damage Amma’s fame,” he warned.

 While addressing media in his residence at Kaveripattinam on Tuesday, Munusamy said Jayalalithaa sacrificed herself for the party. “She had raised the number of cadres up to 1.5 crore during her leadership after MGR,” he said. 
 
 Munusamy termed as a lie Natarajan’s statement that he used to prepare party’s manifesto for Jayalalithaa. She used to discuss with senior functionaries in the party while preparing election manifesto, he added. 
 
 Munusamy also ridiculed Natarajan’s claim that he was invited by former Prime Minister   and former governor Chenna Reddy to sworn in as   chief minister. “Natarajan was not even a basic member in the party and how those leaders would invite him to take charge as CM,” Munusamy questioned.
 
 Munusamy also slammed Natarajan, VK   and their family members for earning assets using Jayalalithaa. “All are criminals and many cases are pending against them,” he said, adding that Natarajan should stop his bluffing henceforth. 
 
 Answering to a question, Munusamy said actor Rajnikanth should face the people first. “But, I am not sure whether he would withstand until that or not,” he replied.
