MUMBAI: As final exams come to an end, principals from state board schools have reiterated their request to allow   for   subjects-history and geography-in class IX. Last year, the state board had issued guidelines for evaluation in class IX but did not mention the grace marks for social science. Principals feel the rule could result in higher number of failures in class IX. 

 In a letter to the state board, authorities from the   group of schools wrote, "For social science subject, there are no internal assessment marks. Also, no grace marks are awarded for students to pass in the subject. If students are not given grace marks or a chance to score in internal assessment, there are chances that they may fail in this subject." 
 
 The school had sent a similar letter to the board in October 2017 demanding 10% grace in the subjects. The issue had come to light when, in a circular dated July 27, 2017, the   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education laid down the marking process for class IX subjects but did not mention if grace marks could be granted for social science.
 
 Rohan Bhat, chairperson of the group of schools, said, "On one hand, the education department is keeping a check on the number of students schools fail in class IX. They blame schools for failing more students for a better result in class X. On the other hand, they have reduced the grace marks which will result in a higher failure rate among class IX students." 
 
 A teacher from a state board school said, "Holding a child back for a few marks in such a crucial year is unfair."
