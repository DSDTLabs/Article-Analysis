Speculations are rife in   that the solution to the decades-old peace process could become a reality in the next three to four months. 

 Therieh said the latest statement of NSCN-K that it is not averse to peace talks is a positive gesture. 
 
 "We welcome such magnanimity and once again appeal to the Government of India to restore ceasefire and initiate political negotiations with NSCN-K so as to eventually bring all   to the negotiating table for inclusive talks."
 
 The NSCN-K, in a message on Tuesday issued by one of its top leaders, said it 'has never been averse to peace or peaceful approach to resolve the issue.'
 
  He stated, "It is, however, quite vigilant of the ever diabolical manoeuvre of India to undermine the   cause on the pretext of peace as had been amply and bitterly experienced in the past."
