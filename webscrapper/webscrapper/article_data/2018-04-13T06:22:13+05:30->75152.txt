NEW DELHI: The government is seeking major relaxations from   in resolution of stressed loans, arguing that the plan put forward by the regulator will not just impact lenders but also push several small companies towards bankruptcy. It has suggested that implementation of rules be deferred, at least for the time being.

 
 Although RBI does not seem to keen on relaxing the rules, sources in the government said the norms proposed in a circular issued in February are impractical and needed to be reviewed. The circular on the new mechanism for resolution of stressed assets has asked lenders to go ahead with a resolution plan even if loan repayment is overdue for just a day. In case a solution is not found within 180 days, banks have been asked to initiate the bankruptcy process and set aside 50% of the loan amount for provisioning once the case is referred to the   ( ).
 
 
  
 
 Bankers believe that the plan is virtually impossible to implement and lenders will see a massive hole in their balance sheet due to higher provisioning requirement.
 
 “This rule should not be implemented at least till the cash cycle improves,” said a source in the government, pointing out that the introduction of GST and demonetisation had impacted cash flows in recent years. “With GST now stabilising and economic activity also picking up, cash flows will improve in coming months.”
 
 Sources pointed out that for small businesses, which deal with government agencies or large companies, payments are often delayed, impacting their cash flows and loan repayment ability. This rule will push many of them into bankruptcy and impact resolution of cases that are underway.
 
 At the same time, officials recognised that the resolution programme through the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was the way forward as it not only speeded up resolution of viable units but also brought transparency into a process that was hitherto shrouded in controversy with rampant charges of favouritism.
