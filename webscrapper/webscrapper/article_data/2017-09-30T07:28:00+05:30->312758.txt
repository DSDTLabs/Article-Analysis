AMRITSAR: More than 10 long-route trains from Amritsar were cancelled and several other diverted as farmers blocked the   rail track at Manawala railway station to demand agri loan waiver. Thousands of passengers were stranded at many stations across the state as even the DMUs could not run. 

 Some main trains which were cancelled by Ferozepur Division in view of the agitation were Amritsar-Jaynagar  , Amritsar-Chhattisgarh Express, Amritsar-Chandigarh Intercity Express, Amritsar to Kolkata Howrah Express, Amritsar-Mumbai Golden Temple Express, Amritsar-Dehradun Lahori Express, Ferozepur-Ludhiana Satluj Express, and  . Besides all intercity diesel multiple unit ( ) trains connecting Amritsar with Beas, Jalandhar and Ludhiana were also cancelled by the railways.
 
 In addition, some trains like Shatabdi Express and Amritsar-New Delhi Shan-e-Punjab Express, and Amritsar-Darbhanga Jan Nayak Express started from Beas railway station as they could not reach up to Amritsar station due to the agitation.
 
 Commercial department inspector at Ludhiana Ajay   said that in view of agitation the railway authorities had to cancel trains which were to run in the evening, like Shaheed Express and Golden Temple Express.
 
 Some trains were diverted through Ferozepur, Gurdaspur, and Pathankot to counter the problem of the heavy rush witnessed due to the blockade at Amritsar â€“Ludhiana, -New Delhi rail route.
 
 Meanwhile threatening to intensify their agitation, Kissan Sangarash Committee state vice-president Swaran Singh Pandher said that the Congress government had neither waived off crop loans of farmers nor it had fulfilled its promise of providing a job in every home. Raising the issue of high farm input costs, he said farming had now become a losing proposition as farmers were even denied the remunerative prices of crops.
