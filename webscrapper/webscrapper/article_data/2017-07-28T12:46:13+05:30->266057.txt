CHANDIGARH: Special   (Central Bureau of Investigation) court dismissed six applications related to demand for extra documents and foreign tour in the graft case in which Economic Offences Wing (EOW) deputy superintendent of police R C Meena was also involved. 

 One of the accused   said since these documents were considered relevant during the course of investigation, they were seized by the investigating officer. The application had stated, “Certain conversation in the form of e-mail, which had not been filed along with chargesheet, constitutes a relevant link between the complainant and the accused.”
 
 Similarly, four other similar applications were filed by four other accused asking for certain documents that were not presented to them along with the supplementary challans. The applications for the same were dismissed by the special CBI court on Thursday. The sixth application was to seek permission to send  , one of the accused, abroad for some work. 
 
  The CBI had arrested EOW deputy superintendent of police (DSP) RC Meena, city police sub-inspector Surinder Kumar, Industrial Area-based Berkeley Automobiles’ owner Sanjay Dahuja, and   owner Aman Grover on August 13, 2015, for allegedly taking bribe of ₹70 lakh.
