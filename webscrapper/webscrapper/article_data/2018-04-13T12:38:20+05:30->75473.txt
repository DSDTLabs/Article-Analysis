THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Indian   (IUML) has resolved to form state-level electoral alliances with ‘like-minded’ secular political parties to prevent minority votes from getting divided in favour of the BJP. The party, at its national council meeting held here on Thursday, also criticized the LDF for ‘taking a stand against the possible secular alliance which can defeat the BJP at the Centre’.

 “Our prime concern is to ensure that the minority votes do not get divided in the assembly state or Parliament elections. So, the IUML will be cautious against fielding its candidates which might possibly divide minority votes in favour of the BJP,” P  , who was re-elected as IUML national general secretary, told reporters after the meeting.
 K M Kader Mohideen, the former MP from  , was re-elected as the IUML national president. Among other resolutions passed at the meeting were the one against the Uniform Civil Code ‘which could destroy the pluralistic nature of Indian society’, and the one against increasing attacks on dalits and minorities in the country. The meeting also amended the party constitution to add three more affiliated organizations – All India Farmers Forum, All India Professionals Forum and All India KMCC (Kerala Muslim Culture Centre) – to the existing four. It also decided to give representation to party members and supporters residing abroad as special invitees to national council through the KMCC branches functioning outside the country.
 
 Mohideen, meanwhile, said that the BJP government at the Centre has failed in all fronts. “The Modi government is pretending to be successful, and after failing to convince people, it’s trying to confuse people,” he said.
 
 The country, he said, is witnessing the worst foreign policy, “with all our neighbours, including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives, turning against India”. “The Modi government wants to destroy Islam and Muslims in India, and now they have extended its hatred towards dalits,” he added.
