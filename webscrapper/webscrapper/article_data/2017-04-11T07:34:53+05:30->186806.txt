CHENNAI: When Rekha was advised to abort her foetus after scans showed a tumour on its back, her maternal instincts told her otherwise. 

 The baby girl lived. But Rekha's fight was far from over. The tumour began to grow thin and fast, threatening to rupture and kill the child.
 
 Doctors, who had advised her to wait till the infant was at least 6kg before excising the tumour, had to go back to their textbooks to find a way to undertake the delicate procedure. "We knew if we waited, the tumour would ruputure. It had grown by at least 2cm in less than a week," said Dr G Balamurali, spine and neurosurgeon, who Rekha and her husband Santhanam, a farmer in  , approached for help. The muscular and vascular tumour had grown larger than the baby's head.
 
 Seven days after she was born, the infant was wheeled into the operation theatre. The baby could not lie on her back as the tumor was located on the back of the spine. A team of doctors comprising a neurosurgeon, paediatric surgeon, plastic surgeon and anaesthetists at   hospital undertook the delicate procedure, which spanned seven hours. "The biggest challenge was to ensure the tumour didn't rupture during the procedure. A small tear can result in loss of at least 100ml of blood," said Dr  , paediatric surgeon. A baby, weighing around 2.5kg like this infant, usually has around 250ml. Surgeons operated around the tumour to excise it. It weighed 300 grams, they said. 
 
 The child was operated under the chief minister's insurance scheme.
