VISAKHAPATNAM: What seemed to really   who flocked the CII-sponsored Partnership Summit here on Friday was a steaming cup of Araku coffee. The coffee and handicrafts stalls set up by   (GCC) and DWCRA at the venue turned out to be quite a hit among participants.

 Sophie Barbier, an Australian settled in Singapore, who came as a representative of the Global Education and Leadership Foundation, said, “I prefer strong coffee to tea and the taste of this coffee particularly is special and different.“ Aleira Susane, a professor from Iowa State University , USA, was also bowled over by the coffee. “I just landed some time ago in beautiful Vizag and got a taste of this delicious coffee. It's very nice indeed,“ she said. “Demand for coffee and other GCC products is overwhelming. Whenever any international summit takes place in AP or even in Delhi, we supply Araku coffee to the delegates and VIPs and it's appreciated everywhere,“ A Ravi Prakash, vice-chairman and MD of GCC, said.
