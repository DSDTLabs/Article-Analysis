KOLKATA: A 37-year-old labour contractor was shot at after two groups of local goons exchanged fire and hurled bombs at each other over the control of a Toto rickshaw stand at Khardah on the northern fringes of the city on Sunday afternoon. Four others received splinter injuries. No one has been arrested yet. 

 According to a source, the trouble broke out around 1.30pm when both the rival gangs gathered at   near   to set up the stand. "Around 60-70 Toto rickshaws are plying in the Khardah-Titagarh area. There is no fixed stand here and the vehicles parked here illegally lead to traffic snarls on the BT Road. On Sunday, members of both the rival groups were trying to grab control over the area where the rickshaw stand will be set up," a trader said.
 
 The armed miscreants opened fire at each other when the labour contractor of a Sodepur biscuits factory,  , was standing outside his house. He was hit by a bullet on his leg. He was rushed to the Barrackpore BN BOSE Hospital where he is still undergoing treatment. The injured persons were admitted to   State General hospital.
