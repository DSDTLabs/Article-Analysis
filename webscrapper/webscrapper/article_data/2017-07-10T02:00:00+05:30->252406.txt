PATNA: The state government will give a presentation on the success of Grievance Redressal Act launched by chief minister Nitish Kumar last year and his seven resolves to bring quality change in the lives of people at a meeting organised by   in New Delhi on Monday. Other states will also list their best practices at the meeting which will be chaired by Prime Minister Narednra Modi.

 Bihar chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said the state would highlight success of Grievance Redressal Act because through which more than one lakh people have already benefited. “We would also give presentation on Saat Nishchay (seven resolves) of CM Nitsih Kumar,” he said. Though there were reports that Bihar would be presenting the positive impact of cash payment under a nutrition programme, the chief secretary denied it. 
 
 Singh said development commissioner Shishir Sinha will represent the state. “Each state will be given three-minute time to make presentation,” he added.
