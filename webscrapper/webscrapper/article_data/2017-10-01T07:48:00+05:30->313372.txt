JALANDHAR: Followers of Ravan objected to the practice of Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and former SAD minister Sucha Singh Langah, who has also been booked for rape, setting his effigies on fire on Dussehra. “Mahatma Ravan fought for the honour and protection of his sister and sacrificed his entire family and kingdom for her. Sita was extended full respect when she was in his custody, even though she was his enemy’s wife. What is happening today is that persons of the likes of Gurmeet Ram Rahim and   reach Dussehra functions to set fire to Ravan’s effigy. They have no shame about what they do themselves,” said   founder Darshan Ratan Ravan on Saturday.

 Darshan said   was held at several places in Punjab. Tributes were paid to Ravan at   town of Jalandhar also on Saturday late afternoon. “In Ludhiana, our units held the prayer at three places at least,” he said.   president Lakhbir Lankesh said they held Ravan Puja in Kapurthala on Saturday morning. “He was a mahatma who displayed high moral standards. Do those who burn his effigies every year have a strong moral character like him? We shall campaign against the burning of his effigies,” he said. The trend of Ravan Puja on Dussehra has been picking up in Punjab for the last few years.
