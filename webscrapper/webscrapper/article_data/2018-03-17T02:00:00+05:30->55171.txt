PATNA: State health minister Mangal Pandey on Friday said the four non-functional ayurveda colleges in the state will start functioning within a year.

 Speaking at the inaugural event of three-day ‘Ayurveda Parv 2017-18’ organised by the Bihar State Ayurvedic Congress in association with the Union ministry of Ayush, Pandey said faculties in the four ayurvedic colleges would be filled soon, which would pave the way for commencement of academic sessions from the next year.
 
 “The Centre recently gave its approval for filling up 47 vacant posts at the ayurveda college in Begusarai. We are also trying to fill 156 posts vacant posts in ayurveda colleges at Buxar, Bhagalpur and Darbhanga respectively. We intend to start classes in all the four colleges from the next year,” Pandey said.
 
 The state has five ayurveda colleges, and the fifth college run by the state government is Patna Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya, which is already functional.
 
 Earlier, chief minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated the event at the Gyan Bhavan. Speaking on the occasion, the CM said the Patna Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya was one of the oldest ayurvedic institutes in the country. He also asked Ayush doctors to focus on their specialisation for treating patients and not divert towards other specialisations such as allopathy.
 
 The CM also asked the health minister to pay the same salary to Ayush doctors as allopathic doctors and not to drag the issue further. This has been one of the main demands of Ayush doctors in the state.
 
 Principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar said the department would try to set up wellness centres in Rajgir and Bodh Gaya on the lines of ayurveda health tourism in Kerala. “We will soon send a proposal to the state government in this regard,” he said.
