BENGALURU: Close on the heels of the BBMP cancelling over 500 illegal khatas and suspending at least 10 officials for their involvement in the offence, police are probing another deep-rooted racket involving a couple who allegedly prepared fake property documents in an attempt to blackmail a   resident.

 Ravi Agarwal, a techie and resident of Kartik Nagar in east Bengaluru, complained to the deputy commissioner of police (Bengaluru west) Ravi Channannavar. He has alleged: “Multiple people are involved in the multi-crore scam, including officials of a co-operative bank. The fraudulent documents include application for khata, khata certificate, khata extract, BBMP plan sanction and BBMP tax-paid receipt.”
 
 Agarwal told STOI that the couple was arrested after he lodged a complaint when they forged khata and other documents of his property in RR Nagar last year. The couple, after being released on bail, continued to forge property documents, including khata.
 
  Channananavar said they are investigating the case. “We have identified a few culprits, mostly from the land mafia, who have masterminded the scam. Prima facie it looks like a deep-rooted racket,” the DCP added.
 
 
  N C, deputy commissioner (RR Nagar), said he has not come across any fraudulent property documents after last year’s scam. “We have been following prescribed norms to issue khata and crosschecking necessary documents,” he added.
