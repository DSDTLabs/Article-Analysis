PANCHKULA: The   had to cancel and re-call a tender for   and   only one person applied for it.

 Corporation officials told TOI that as per the rules, they cannot award the tender to the sole applicant, and that two parties are required for the process to continue.
 
 Residents welfare association members told TOI that soon after a rabid dog attacked more than 15 persons in Surajpur on April 16, commissioner Lalit Siwach promised them that he would restart the process of sterilization and vaccination within a week. On April 17, after a meeting and taking the consent of all councillors, he started the process.
 
 “The issue is of public interest,“ said  , a social activist from Panchkula. “If only one person has applied, then corporation officials should have given the tender to that person.“ The rejected tender applicant is Dr MR Singla, a former deputy director of Animal Husbandry .
 
 “The reason I applied is that I have experience as well as knowledge in this field,“ Singla told TOI. “I have requested corporation officials to start the process as soon as possible, but due to only one application, it has to call it again.“
 
 A senior corporation official said, “The tender has been re-issued hoping that more persons will participate in the process this time, so that the work can be re-started.“
 
 If the tender gets only one applicant for a third time too, the corporation is permitted to award it to the applicant.
