GURUGRAM: The   having grabbed the headlines with its crackdown on slaughterhouses, could Haryana be far behind? As it turns out, the Khattar government has now asked all municipal bodies in the state to provide information on the number of   and authorised   in their respective areas by 11am on Thursday.

 In response,   authorities have already claimed that all meat shops in Gurgaon are illegal. In fact, an MCG official claimed there are no registered meat shops in the entire state. “The reason is, there has to be designated areas for slaughtering, which neither Gurgaon nor any other municipality has. For Gurgaon, an area was designated in Sector 37, but objections were raised and it was decided the slaughterhouse would be located outside MCG zone. A committee, chaired by the deputy commissioner, has been set up to look into the matter. Since there are no registered meat shops, it’s difficult to give their number in Gurgaon,” said V Umashankar, the MCG commissioner.
 
 To fulfil the government order, though, MCG has decided to conduct a survey of all meat shops in the city, issue licenses and designate spots for them, especially in the light of Shiv Sainiks attacking some meat shops in the city on Wednesday.
 
 “The MCG medical officer has been asked to conduct a survey of all meat shops in the city, so that we know how many such shops exist here. We’ll try to see if we can register and designate spaces for them if possible. We want to provide a suitable place for meat shops, but the problem is nobody wants them in their backyard and it’s very difficult to convince people,” said a senior MCG official.
