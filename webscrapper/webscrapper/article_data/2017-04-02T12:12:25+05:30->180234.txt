MUMBAI: There's a growing opinion that   is perhaps a little too aggressive in his captaincy style. Former India skipper   even feels that Kohli let his emotions affect his batting in the recent series against Australia, which was marked by plenty of bad blood. Former India skipper  , though, feels that the India Test skipper must be respected for what he is. "Maybe, I tend to agree on that (what Ganguly felt), but at the end of the day, that's how he is. That's how he plays and we have to respect that," Azhar said on the sidelines of the inaugural Raj Singh Dungarpur 'Spirit of cricket' lecture at the Cricket Club of India here on Saturday.

 Kohli went into the series against  's side in great form, but suddenly lost his magical touch, managing just 46 runs in five innings with scores of 0, 13, 12, 15 and 6 in three games. He had to sit out of the fourth and final Test because of a shoulder injury. The 28-yearold was more in the news for his run-ins with the Aussies than for his performance. The 54-year-old remarked that with India slated to play a lot of cricket overseas in the next season (tours to Sri Lanka and then perhaps the 'real test' of this team in South Africa), it would help if a few Indian players like batsman  , who remained unsold in the   auction, play country cricket in England this summer. "We've done really well. I'm sure they can do well (overseas). I would like some of the players who are not playing the IPL to go and play county cricket and get the experience of playing on different kinds of wickets. At this time, in April May June, the ball moves so much. It would be a good experience and exposure to Pujara and some other players. That experience will be very good when we go to England or in conditions where the ball tends to move and bounce," he 99-Test veteran said.
