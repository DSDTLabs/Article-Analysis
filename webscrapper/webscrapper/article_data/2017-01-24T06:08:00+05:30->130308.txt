Surjagad (Etapalli): The heavily-rusted and awkwardly bent signboard of Surjagarh village on Etapalli-Gatta road somewhat also reflects the condition of the nondescript tribal hamlet, around 165km from Gadchiroli, bearing the burden of apathy in every nook and corner.

 Though the village has now become a reference point to the national debate on Naxalite-government clash over mining projects in mineral rich regions due to multi-crore mining project of Llyods Metal and Energy Ltd, local tribals claimed that the high status of their native place merely serves as a mockery.
 
 Surjagarh, having around 250 families, remains wrapped in dark after sunset barring a couple of its lanes where two solar power-driven lamp posts are functional.
 
 With a defunct solar power-driven potable water storage project and a few meters of cemented road flanked by thatched houses most of which are still bereft of electricity, the villagers questioned the flow of developmental funds which they have been assured by government representatives.
 
 “We hear that there is a steady flow of donations and contributions from all over the country for the shrine of our chief deity. Going by the condition of the shrine, it seems that the entire contributions are pocketed by politicians,” said a tribal on the condition of anonymity.
 
 “We have five borings for potable water but three are defunct. The solar power-driven overhead storage tank is lying non-functional for the last five years with no one interested in our well-being,” said another tribal.
 
 “Outsiders feel that Surjagarh is a developed place with the mining project coming up in the vicinity, but people should come here and see what is the progress of development here,” he said.
 
 “The district administration should conduct a survey in our village to assess how much budget has been sanctioned and how much has been spent,” the tribal added.
