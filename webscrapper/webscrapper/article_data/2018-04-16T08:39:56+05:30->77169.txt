PONDA: The BJP-backed   on Sunday announced its list of candidates for the upcoming   municipal council ( ) elections, after a period of intense confusion with multiple party members being nominated from the same ward in several cases.

 “We have persuaded our members in wards where more than one party member has filed nomination to favour one candidate,” said outgoing councilor and   in-charge for the PMC polls,  .
 
 Claiming they had the same chairperson and the same deputy for their entire five-year office term, outgoing deputy chairperson   said the panel has proved it will provide stability to the civic body and would continue the same style of work if re-elected.
 
 The panel has also rejected any possibility of passing benefits to Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party-backed ‘Rising Ponda’ by sharing votes as the political parties are backing two different panels in the polls.
 
 Earlier, in the 2013 elections, the BJP-MGP alliance-backed Ponda Nagrik Samiti had swept the council polls by winning 11 seats in the 14-member civic body.
