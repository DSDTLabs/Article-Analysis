QUEPEM: A gang of   damaged CCTV cameras in the heart of   early Wednesday morning before they decamped with over Rs 1 lakh in cash, after breaking open the shutters of four shops. 

 At around 6.30am, the owner of a sweet mart was the first to notice the broken locks and slightly-opened shutters. He immediately informed Quepem police.
 
 The thieves struck a mobile shop, from which they stole Rs 73,000 but no cellphones. They also stole Rs 10,000 from a wine shop, Rs 14,660 from a bakery, and Rs 7,000 from the sweet mart. 
 
 With their faces covered, they damaged the shops' CCTV cameras. Footage showed one person enterting a shop while two others remained outside. The bakery was broken into at 3.30am. Quepem police said that the same gang struck a mobile shop at Canacona before proceeding to Quepem. They also tried to break the shutter of a goldsmith's shop, but were unsuccessful. 
 
 A Quepem police team headed by PI Brutano Peixoto recorded the statements of all four shop owners at 7.30am. A dog squad was called from Panaji and fingerprint experts from Verna. 
 
 Quepem police registered offences against unknown persons under Sections 457 and 380 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 
 
 Meanwhile, the thefts have left Quepem residents feeling unsafe. Fredrick Pereira, an activist, alleged that authorities are least bothered about public safety. He said that dozens of CCTV cameras installed under the MP scheme by then-MP Francisco Sardinha are not functional. After their installation, the cameras were damaged and never repaired. 
 
 After the South Goa collector wrote to Quepem Municipal Council (QMC) to maintain the cameras, the QMC refused to do so, adopting a resolution not to pay any bill or carry out any maintenance work because the cameras were not installed by them.
