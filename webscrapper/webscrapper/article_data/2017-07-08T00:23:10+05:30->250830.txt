Bhopal: Zahida Parvez — one of the key accused in Shehla Masood murder case — who was granted bail on Thursday, will have to wait for a few more days before stepping out of jail after five years.

 “I am happy that she had been granted bail. But I am not well and was not able to go to Indore for ensuring execution of the bail,” Zahida’s maternal uncle, Tajjamul Ali, who had adopted her when she was a child, told TOI from Jabalpur.
 
 “I am still in Jabalpur and will only be able to reach Indore by July 11. I believe that she will come out of the jail on Tuesday,” he said.
 
 Zahida was born in Gadarwara of Narsinghpur district of Madhya Pradesh. Ali, who runs a hardware shop in Jabalpur town, adopted Zahida and her younger sister while they were children. She was brought up in Andher Dev locality of Jabalpur. She also had her schooling in Jabalpur.
 
 
 Since Tajjamul Ali did not have any kids, he adopted Zahida. 
 
 Zahida in her argument through advocate Sunil Shrivastav, had on Thursday told the court that she was convicted without any substantial evidence and that except for the diary, there was no evidence connecting her to the crime. She is lodged in Barwani jail at present.
 
 Zahida and Saba, along with shooters Shaquib and Tabish, were convicted by a special CBI court in Indore on January 28, 2017. Special CBI judge B K Paloda had awarded life imprisonment to all four convicts.
 
 On August 16, 2011, RTI activist Shehla Masood was found dead outside her residence at Koh-e-Fiza, Bhopal. Later, CBI arrested five suspects — Zahida, Farooqui, Tabish, Shaquib and Irrfan. Irrfan turned approver and the rest were convicted for murder.
