NAVI MUMBAI: A   in the city has formed an   to deal with the  . The NGO, Eunoia Therapy Foundation, has been created with the aim to reduce, reuse and recycle   waste.

 The volunteers have been collecting plastic waste from the doorsteps of flats in housing societies for free and then give it to recycling factories to convert it in pyro oil (a process called pyrolysis), which is used in generators and machineries. 
 
 The waste that is not recycled is used as bottles to plant trees in vertical gardens.
 
 The drive, which started in Pune in August 2016 has spread its wings to Mumbai and Navi Mumbai with the participation of many youngsters. 
 
 Shrutika Bhurkhe, founder of the NGO, said, “We conducted surveys in various localities and came to know that people have very little knowledge about plastic pollution. Often people do not know how to handle plastic waste. We started spreading awareness by keeping bins wherever we visited and asked people to put plastic waste in these bins and not throw them anywhere else.”
 
 In June this year, the volunteers collected 127kg of trash from various housing societies. Shreya Kulkarni, another member of the group, said, “We keep our bins in societies or the volunteers collect plastic waste from homes on call. If we are able to spread awareness everywhere, housing society members can segregate plastic waste and handover it to us for proper plastic waste management.”
 
 The group is organising awareness programmes in low income group areas and near slums to sensitize people with the help of reuse activities. To ensure reduction in plastic use the volunteers are encouraging people with the ‘no plastic’ campaign by distributing paper and cloth bags.
