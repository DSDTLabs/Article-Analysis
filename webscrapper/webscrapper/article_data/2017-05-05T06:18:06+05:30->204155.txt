 His family members cited the sugarcane crops affected by wilt as the reason for his suicide. The Thiruvaiyaru police carried out investigation with his family members and villagers who all claimed that the drought forced him to commit suicide. 
 
 Gavaskar lodged a complaint with the Thiruvaiyaru police stating that his father cultivated sugarcane in his 7 acres land. He supplied the sugarcane to Arignar Anna cooperative sugar mill in Kurungulam last year and this year as well. The mill owed his Rs 4 lakh for the supply of sugarcane. Meanwhile, he took out cultivation of sugarcane this time as well. Since the monsoon failed, he struggled to water the sugarcanes. Hence, he dug up a bore well for which he spent Rs 1 lakh but the yield was poor from the borewell. 
 
 Unable to find a solution he had been upset for the last few days, said the Thiruvaiyaru police quoting the family members. 
 
 Selvaraj went to the farm land on Wednesday night but he did not return home. His body was found in the farm the next morning. 
 
 His body was sent to the Thiruvaiyaru government hospital for post-mortem. The body was received by the family today. The police registered a case.
