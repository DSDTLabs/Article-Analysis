KOCHI: Temperatures have begun to steadily shoot up in the city. The weather department recorded 37 degrees in Kochi on Wednesday even as the minimum temperature remained at 22 degrees.

 “There is an increase of 2-3 degrees in temperatures on some days this month which is unusual. The ultra-violet rays have also increased. This is a feature when there are clear skies,” said researchers monitoring weather conditions at the ST radar centre in   (Cusat)
 
 “We are registering extreme temperatures this season. In the early morning it is cool. The sun rises around 6.30 am. The temperatures in the next two hours is about 28-29 degrees centigrade. Suddenly, it shoots up to 32-32 degrees by 10 am and goes up to 35 degrees on most days. This is not good for human health. The dry conditions prevailing in the soil also contribute to this,” said C K Rajan, atmospheric scientist.
 
 The district heath department officials said while there is a small rise in the number of chickenpox cases, there is no major cause for concern. “Though chicken pox is reported throughout the year, summer is the season when it peaks. Parents are concerned because it is exam season. Ideally, people with low immunity, newborns and elderly children are vulnerable,” said Dr  , IMA-Kochi president.
 
 “We have got a communication from the health department to watch out for   as two cases have been reported in Thrissur district.
 
 District surveillance officer   said: “With summer peaking, diseases like hepatitis, typhoid, diarrhoea may spread. So we have given instructions to hospitals in the district to keep vigil.”
