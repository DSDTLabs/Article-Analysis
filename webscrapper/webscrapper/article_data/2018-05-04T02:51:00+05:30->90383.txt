Nagpur: A three-storey air-conditioned marriage hall was demolished by Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) on Thursday as it was located in a residential area — Ladikar Layout on Manewada Road. Assistant commissioner of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had lodged a complaint against the hall pointing out a large number of violations. Earlier, corporator from the area had lodged a complaint with the NMC.

 Avinash Badge, divisional officer (south), told TOI that the owner Vilas Ladikar had earlier built a small community hall. “At that time nobody opposed it, but later he constructed a three-storeyed marriage hall. There were frequent traffic jams and noise pollution,” he said.
 
 The officer said as per norms, a marriage hall can only be built on a road having a width of 12 metre or more. “The road on two sides of the hall was only 25 feet wide. Floor to space index (FSI) rules were also violated while constructing the building. Against an area of 6,000 square feet, the construction was 9,000 square feet. The owner had left no side margins, which is mandatory,” he added.
 
 The NIT had received a complaint from the NMC in March. Ladikar was served a notice on March 16. Five days later, the hall owner submitted an application for regularizing the building. “The hall is located in a Gunthewari layout. One has to pay scrutiny charges for getting the plot regularized. Ladikar had not paid it so his building was impossible to regularize. We rejected his application on April 6,” Badge added.
 
 He further said that the one-month notice period ended on April 15 but as NIT officials were busy preparing for Samadhan Shibir, the hall was spared for some time. “We then sought protection from Hudkeshwar police, who agreed to provide the same on May 3,” he added.
 
 There are several commercial buildings in residential areas. FSI violations are rampant. However, the NIT acted only in this case because a corporator had lodged a complaint.
