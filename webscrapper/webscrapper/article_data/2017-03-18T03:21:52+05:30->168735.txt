NAVI MUMBAI: Motorists are having a harrowing time while travelling between   railway station and   flyover on the Belapur corridor of the  , as vehicles are being diverted to the service road due to flyover and subway work.

  Motorists say that traffic snarls are a regular feature and no traffic cops are found on this 3-km service road.
 
 Many allege that traffic cops prefer to stand at signals on Thane-Belapur Road to penalize violators rather than streamlining the increased load on the service road. 
 
 “Since the Thane-Belapur Road traffic has been diverted to the service road near Ghansoli, we have been regularly facing bottlenecks. No traffic cop is seen along this stretch due to which we have been left with no option but to crawl along the service road,” said Thane resident Manish Pal.
 
 Senior traffic cops said that they were short-staffed to monitor the stretch and measures would soon be taken to ease the snarls. However, this has failed to calm down the motorists. 
 
 Private security guards deployed by the firm constructing the flyover are often seen streamlining the flow in the absence of traffic cops. Morning and evening peak hour slots have turned into nightmare for motorists.
 
 “Cops should be deployed along the bottleneck stretch rather than manning the signals. This is complete mismanagement. There was a pile-up on Mahape end of the service road on Thursday morning, which escalated our travel time to over an hour,” said Airoli’s Nakul Shinde.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Nitin Pawar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) said, “Due to the flyover and underpass work, we face a tough time managing the increasing density of vehicles on the service road. However, we will soon divert our staff to man the chronic spots.”
