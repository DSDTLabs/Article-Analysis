NAGPUR: In the wake of massive response to   (IIIT) in its first year of operations in  , its Board of Governors (BOG) granted permission to increase   by 120 in both branches. While   (CSE) would get 80 more seats, thus taking its intake to 120, the Electronics and Telecommunications (E & T) would get 40 extra seats, taking its tally to 80.

 “We started a bit cautiously initially with 40 seats each, as infrastructure and facilities weren’t ready. But after all systems are in place, the BOG granted permission to increase the intake capacity,” joint director for technical education Gulabrao Thakre told TOI.
 
 IIIT-N is the state’s first such institute, set up under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode, followed by Pune. Both became reality, eight years after they were conceptualized, thanks to initiatives taken by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.
 
 Currently, the Nagpur college is operating from BSNL Regional Telecom Training Centre (RTTC) at Seminary Hills and it has attracted many top rankers and its admissions were full after first two rounds only.
 
 Thakre informed that when it was decided to start the IIIT in city, they had proposed 60 seats for each branch, but after taking into the consideration all factors, they reduced the capacity. “We wanted to start the prestigious institution and make it successful. Less number of students helps in proper planning of all activities. So we started with 40 seats. But now, we’re ready to accommodate 120 more students,” he said.
 
 He informed that the admissions to all IIITs in the country are conducted by the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA), set up by the ministry of human resources development (MHRD) to manage and regulate the joint seat allocation for admissions to 92 institutes. This includes 22 IITs, ISM, 31 NITs, 20 IIITs and 18 Other-Government Funded Technical Institutes (Other-GFTIs). The students however need to clear joint entrance examination (JEE) with decent score.
