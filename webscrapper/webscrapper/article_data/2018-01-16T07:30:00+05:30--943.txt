Panchkula: Facing stray cattle menace in the entire district and shortage of space in the gaushalas of the district, Panchkula municipal corporation (MC) laid down the foundation stone for the construction of new cow shelter in Sukhdarshan village on Monday. Haryana agriculture minister O P Dhankar and urban local bodies minister Kavita Jain attended the ceremony. 

 Land for the cow shelter was donated by the villagers to the MC and will be constructed in 21 acres of land with a budget of Rs 83 lakh. This cow shelter will also have a dog rescue centre, which is the first of its kind in the entire country. 
 
 Residents in Panchkula are of the view that the menace of stray cattle and canine in the city will only go worse. Residents also informed that horses, cows and buffaloes remain on the road for hours which creates problem for the passers-by, especially children and aged people, who fear being attacked by the stray animals. 
 
 Sumit Raheja, a resident of Sector 14, said, “Various minor accidents in the city are caused due to the presence of stray cattle on the roads.” Various complaints were submitted with the municipal corporation regarding the issue of stray cattle but no action has been taken by the officials till now, alleged the residents. 
 
 MC officials have conducted various meetings with all local dairy owners and sarpanches of local villages and have given them a strict warning to keep their animals in the gaushala, but to no avail.
 
 Mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia said, “This cow shed will help in sheltering a large number of stray cattle in it.”
 
 During the event, MC commissioner Rajesh Jogpal, sub-divisional magistrate Pankaj Setia, deputy mayor Sunil Talwar, district BJP president Deepak Sharma, councillor C B Goel, executive officer O P Sihag, among other officials and BJP members supported were present.
