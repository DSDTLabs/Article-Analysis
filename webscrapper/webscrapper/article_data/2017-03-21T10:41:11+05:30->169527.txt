TRICHY: The   in Trichy seems to be falling apart after former   K Soundararasan, a founding member, showed signs of shifting loyalty to the   faction of AIADMK. 

 Voice of dissent emerged at the meeting of district functionaries at   on Sunday when Soundararasan expressed his views against the niece of former chief minister J  , Deepa Jeyakumar. Soundararasan was among the early leaders who organised a consultation meeting in Trichy and launched a separate wing called J Deepa Peravai in AIADMK to register their strong opposition to Sasikala and support for Deepa. This was after Deepa expressed her willingness to enter politics after the death of her aunt. 
 
 In the later weeks, Deepa had launched the MGR Amma Deepa forum and consolidated her support base in the state. However, her husband who has developed differences with her had announced floating of a political party on Saturday. This had irked many of her supporters and Soundararasan is among the first ones to raise the voice of dissent. 
 
 At the meeting, he told Deepa that he thought she would follow in the footsteps of her aunt but there has been confusion right from the appointment of functionaries of the forum. Citing inaccessibility to Deepa as a major reason he said that her contradictory statements on demanding probe into the death of Jayalalithaa and support to O Panneerselvam had led to his decision. 
 
 While Soundararasan could not be reached after repeated attempts to reach him over phone, sources from the forum said that he had decided to offer support to the O Panneerselvam faction of AIADMK. Meanwhile a section of Deepa supporters burnt the effigy of Soundararasan near Anna statue and central bus stand. Police arrested 10 persons who were members of Deepa Peravai for their act.
