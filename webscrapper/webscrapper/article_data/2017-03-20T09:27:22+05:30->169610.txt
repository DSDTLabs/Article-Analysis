LUCKNOW: As colours of celebration descended on BJP's office in Lucknow on March 11, hundreds of workers were seen sprinkling kesariya gulaal on each other. 

 But one of them stood tallest among all. The man, over six feet tall, was  , who took oath as   with 46 others on Sunday. Raza, a former   cricketer, is the only Muslim face on Yogi minister. 
 
 A Shia from old Lucknow, Raza a BJP spokesperson who defends the party on air during debates on various regional news channels. Like a perfect all-rounder, Raza has been batting for his party for over a year now. Talking to TOI he said, "the perception that BJP is an anti-Muslim party is wrong and by associating myself with it, I tried to counter the misconception." 
 
 He often quotes his own example to prove his point. "Parties like Congress have for long kept the community in fear of the BJP, which they project as being anti-Muslim. But that’s not the case at all. We just don’t believe in vote bank politics practised by others,” says Raza. 
 
 While his brother Arshi had affiliations with Congress, he made way into the party in 2013 through a pro-BJP posters campaign. The posters made way into the mind space because they voiced what BJP leaders had been asserting for long. But they also came with problems. "I’ve received death threats and face all sorts of wild accusations, ranging from molestation to trespass,” he recalled.
 
 Raza promised to raise Old city's pending issues like drainage and power woes though he is not sure of the role he would be given. "I am a dedicated party worker and would take up any area of work given to me," he said.
