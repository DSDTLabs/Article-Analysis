 “Gangster Ravi Pujari had made threat calls to 10 Congress MLAs during the assembly session last year. At that time, the state home minister had given an assurance to conduct an investigation into the matter. At what stage the probe has reached now? How many accused have been arrested? Thakor has written. 
 
 “I want your reply on other aspects too, such as from where the calls were made and who the callers were? Also, how many threat and extortion calls were made by Ravi Pujari in the past two years and to whom,” Thakor has asked. 
 
 The letter is also marked to chief minister Vijay Rupani and minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja. 
 
 Responding to Thakor’s letter, Jadeja said, “Investigation is currently on into gangster Ravi Pujari’s alleged threat calls to 10 Congress MLAs last year. We took help of the Mumbai Police in matching voice samples of the callers with the spectrographic profile of Pujari. In some cases, it has been proved that the calls were indeed made by Pujari but in some cases, the callers’ identities are yet to be fixed. We have made appeals to ignore such calls. We are also taking help of national and international agencies to nab him (Pujari).”
 
 Last year, the then leader of opposition from the Congress, Shankersinh Vaghela, had alleged that Pujari had made extortion calls to the Congress MLAs. Vaghela had then said that Congress's Gujarat in-charge Gurudas Kamat and 10 MLAs including Shaktisinh Gohil, C K Raulji, Amit Chavda, Hira Patel, Gova Rabari, Javed Pirzada and Chandrika Bariya had received threat calls from the gangster.
