Ludhiana: Two Nihangs attacked a petrol pump employee with swords following a verbal spat on Humbran Road on Tuesday afternoon. 

 The victim, Swarnjit Singh, 34, told the police, “A Nihang came to the pump on a motorcycle for a refill. Soon, he started wrangling over money and thrashed me. When the other employees of the pump came to my rescue, he sped away. After some time, he returned along with another Nihang. The two attacked me with swords.” 
 
 Amid the violent ruckus, a staffer called up the pump owner, Raghav Sharma.
 
 Sharma said, “I called up the police control room a number of times, but to no avail. I then asked an employee to rush to the police station.” 
 
 Assistant sub-inspector Balwinder Singh said, “We are scrutinising the footage of CCTV cameras installed on the premises. The cameras have captured the attack. The injured has been admitted to civil hospital, where his condition is stated to be stable.”
