As hundreds of vehicles coming from Lahaul-Spiti and Leh were stranded, most commuters had to spend the night on the road. They managed to move on only after BRO had cleared the debris with the help of men and machines.

 There was no movement of tourist vehicles from Manali towards   on Tuesday. However, vehicles were coming towards Kullu-Manali from Lahaul-Spiti, Pangi and Leh. Sources said five HRTC buses were also stuck on the highway.
 
 Considering the tourist rush and movement of Army convoys towards forward posts in Ladakh region, the   is strategically important and keeping it open in all weather conditions is the responsibility of the BRO.
 
 “During monsoon, landslide and boulders not only block this road frequently but it also makes the journey risky,” said Dinesh Kumar, a resident of Goshal village in Lahaul. “We were coming from Udaipur towards Manali without knowing about the landslide and no one at Khoksar told us about the road block. When we reached near Rahni nullah we found a long line of vehicles due to the landslide. Instead of waiting inside the vehicle for the night, we decided to return to Khoksar,” said Lal Chand.
 
 Col A K Awasthi, Commander, 38 Border Road Task Force, said that a heavy landslide with big boulders occurred at Rahni nullah, some 40 km from Manali that blocked the Manali-Sarchu road. He said that landslide was triggered by incessant rain in the area and added that with the help of men and machines it was cleared on Wednesday around 12.15pm.
 
 He said that the huge and continuing slide was cleared with the help of heavy machinery and now the traffic was normal on this road. He said to clear the debris, 68 BRO personnel, two dozers, one excavator and one compressor was deployed.
