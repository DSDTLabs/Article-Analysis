Koratala Siva’s ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’, starring   as CM Bharat and   as his lady love Vasumati is raking in good numbers since its release on April 20.

  The film is making good business both in India and overseas and the latest is that the film has crossed the $3M mark in the US. Trade analyst Ramesh Bala confirmed the same and wrote on his social media, “#BharatAneNenu Latest Overseas BO: #USA - $3,192,011 [₹ 21.32 Crs] (Till Apr 30th), #Australia - A$443,974 [₹ 2.23 Crs] (Till Apr 29th)” (sic) He also revealed that in UAE, the film raked in $263,180 between April 19 and 22. 
 
  Another trade analyst Taran Adarsh too wrote a few days ago, “It's MAHESH MANIA Overseas... Telugu film #BharatAneNenu takes international markets by storm...Week 1: N America $ 3.015 million [incl non-reported], Aus+NZ $ 535k, Europe & UK $ 350k, Africa, Malaysia, Singapore [2 days] & Rest $ 150k, GCC $ 600k, Total: $ 4.65 mn [₹ 31.04 cr].” (sic)
 
  The film is close to touching the Rs 200 Cr mark worldwide, raking in Rs 161.28 Cr in its first week, and approximately Rs 181.28 Cr in its 10 day run. Despite clashing with ‘Achari America Yatra’, ‘Kanam’ and even ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ later on, the film with music by   still managed to hold its own. The film witnessed a considerable amount of dip in its second Friday, however, became the first choice again seeing as how neither ‘Achari America Yatra’ nor ‘Kanam’ made much of a mark on the audience.
 
  ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ charts the journey of a young London bred man who’s forced to take up the CM chair of an undivided Andhra Pradesh after the sudden death of his father. However, he soon wins the hearts of people and makes enemies out of those who believed he would be nothing more than a puppet in the position. The film featured music by Devi Sri Prasad, which was also appreciated by many.
