MUMBAI:   rented by the   to flush out water in flood-prone areas during the four monsoon months, may drain its coffers. The BMC will hire 298 pumps for Rs 54 crore for a two-year period. Till 2017, the BMC paid over Rs 16 crore for 310 pumps hired for a year.

 SP corporator   said, “The hiring cost has inflated. Also, the fact that the BMC plans to hire so many pumps shows that it is anticipating another waterlogged monsoon.”
 
 But civic officials said the escalated cost is due to increased labour charges. “Labour commission informed us that if the minimum charges are not paid, we would be penalized,” said an official. “While 16 pumps are expected to flush out water at 480 cubic metre/hour, another placed near   will remove water at 1000 cubic metre/hour. The average capacity is 250 cubic metre/hour.”
