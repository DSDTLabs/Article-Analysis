 The   located around 150m away from the   was closed down on April 1 following the SC ruling.
 
 "We have done nothing illegal. The plot behind the bar also belongs to the owner and we have constructed an extended way to reach the bar. Now it is 520 metres from the highway. We are set to approach the circle inspector of excise with the new route map to authorize the reopening of the bar," said Shiju P, bar manager.
 
 The maze begins a walking distance of 100 metres along a pocket road. According to senior excise officials the move by the management is acceptable. "We do no measure the aerial distance but only the walking distance. However, they will be fined for altering the entrance," said A Vijayan IPS, additional excise commissioner (enforcement).

 Licence of the bar which is more than 30-years-old is in the name of KV Varkey, a Thodupuzha native. Varkey, according to sources, owns as many as 9 bars many of which were closed down recently causing him a good deal of financial loss.
