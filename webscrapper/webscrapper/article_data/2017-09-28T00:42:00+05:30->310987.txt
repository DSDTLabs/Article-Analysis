Salem: A 70-year-old farmer has undergone a critical   in a city hospital, said to be the first such procedure performed in the state, that helped restore the man’s vision.

 “It’s a major surgical treatment for corneal endothelium damage, a disorder that affects the cornea and adversely impacts vision. The innovative technique called the Pre-descement endothelial keratoplasty (PDEK) procedure was the first such in Tamil Nadu,” said Dr Karpagavalli, medical director of Dr. Agarwal’s Eye Hospital, where the surgery was performed.
 
 The patient had a condition called Bullous Keratopathy, formed due to endothelial dysfunction. The disorder, which was common among aged people and which might occur after eye surgery such as cataract or glaucoma treatment, involves swelling of the cornea.
 
 Dr Karpagavalli told media persons that the PDEK was conducted as a day-care procedure. The treatment was given free of cost under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Insurance Scheme . “After the surgery the patient has a near clear vision and is back leading a normal life,” she added.
