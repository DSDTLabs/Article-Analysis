LUCKNOW: Children in   are drifting away from government schools. The   revealed that in six years, between 2010 to 2016,   in government-run primary and upper primary schools came down by 18.6%. For the same period,   shot up by 36.5%. 

 Student enrolment in government schools in 2010-11 was 1.96 crore which declined to 1.66 crore in 2015-16 whereas private school enrolment, which stood at 1.22 crore in 2010-11, went up to 1.67 crore in 2015-16. The overall enrolment has, however, seen an increment — from 3.19 crore in 2010-11 to 3.33 crore in 2015-16. 
 
 CAG pointed out that the state government’s reply on government schools losing popularity was also not satisfactory. The state government had stated that the increase in overall enrolment showed that the objectives of the Right to Education (RTE) Act were met, the report said. Further, the   report stated that immediate action on improving the academic atmosphere in government-run schools and making available the learning material couldn’t be overlooked. 
 
 To improve the situation, CAG has made recommendations to the government to identify such students who don’t enrol in government schools and also to keep track of dropouts, mostly the primary ones, and bring them back to school. Two, the government should make use of encouraging and rewarding methods to explore the possibility of running existing government schools on public-private partnership (PPP) model. 
 
 Principal secretary, basic education, RP Singh said, “It’s a matter of great concern for us that enrolment in government schools is declining. We feel that this may be due to the perception of parents about the quality of teaching in government schools, and teachers’ irregular attendance. Also with rising income, parents are attracted to English medium schools.”
