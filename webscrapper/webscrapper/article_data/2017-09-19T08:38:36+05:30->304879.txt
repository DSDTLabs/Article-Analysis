CHENNAI: Hours after speaker P Dhanapal disqualified 18 MLAs on Monday,T T V   hit out at chief minister Edappadi K   and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam by stating that the "traitors would be sent home by this monthend" and that his team was approaching the court for legal remedy . "We will participate in a floor test for sure," he said.

 Recalling the representation submitted by 19 MLAs to the governor expressing lack of confidence in the chief minister, Dhinakaran said Palaniswami had resorted to "shortcuts" such as disqualification, as he was aware of the fact that 21 MLAs were supporting him and that ten were indirectly in contact with him. "If there is a floor test, he knows that he will go home. With disqualification, he could bring down the majority mark to win the floor test," the leader said.
 
 Accusing the chief minister of conspiring against him, Dhinakaran sought to remind that it was his aunt  , who made him chief minister. "Palaniswami is like Aurangazeb," he said, alleging that the chief minister was misusing his power and position to propagate a false campaign against him.
 
 He criticised Palaniswami for deploying various means to cling on to power and escape possible action from the enforcement agencies, since many of his immediate family members were already facing trials by the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax department."That is why he joined hands with O Panneerselvam.We will not allow these traitors wh these traitors who try to deceive the party workers and people," he said.
 
 Dhinakaran slammed the disqualification move, calling it a murder of democracy. "I did not expect this from speaker P Dhanapal. It would not have taken place in  , had the governor safeguarded the dignity of his chair. He had failed to do so," he said.
