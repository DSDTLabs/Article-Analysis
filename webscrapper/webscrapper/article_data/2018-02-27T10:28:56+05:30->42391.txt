CHENNAI: Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu have demanded an apology from the Centre over a Sanskrit song at an event attended by   ministers Nitin Gadkari and Pon Radhakrishnan at   Madras on Monday. Leader of opposition M K   condemned the act, asking why the ‘Tamizhthai Vazthu’ was not played.

 Agroup of students sang Sanskrit invocation ‘Maha Ganapathim’, penned by late poet Muthuswami Dikshithar. In astatement, Stalin said, “The Sanskrit invocation song is based on a religion. All government functions in Tamil Nadu commence with the Tamil anthem. The Centre has ignored this practice to insult the Tamil language and its culture.”   chief Vaiko, PMK leader Anbumani and CPI(M) state secretary   also condemned the act.
 
 Following the controversy, IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthy said, “We have here students from all over the country. Not all can sing in Tamil. At events, the students sing in Marathi, Hindi, Bengali and other languages too. We don’t tell the students which songs to sing.”
