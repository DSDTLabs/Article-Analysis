Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said his government would try to find jobs for the kin of those killed in Iraq and would continue to pay the Rs 20,000 compensation which the families were already being given.

 He said he has spoken to the minister of state in the ministry of external affairs V K Singh to follow up on the issue of bringing back the mortal remains of the Indian hostages killed in Iraq. Amarinder said V K Singh had informed him that the remains of the deceased would take about a week to reach India.
 
 Since the majority of those killed were from Punjabâ€™s Majha and Doaba regions, the coffins with the remains were likely to arrive in Amritsar, said the chief minister. He added his government would try to find jobs for the kin of the deceased and would continue to pay the Rs 20,000 compensation which the families were already being given.
 
 Speaking to the mediapersons at the state assembly on Wednesday, the chief minister said he had also written to the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on the issue on Tuesday. Amarinder also said he would also pursue with the central government the issue of grant of compensation to the bereaved families.
