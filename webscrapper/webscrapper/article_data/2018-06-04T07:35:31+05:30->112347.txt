NAGPUR: Around 50 inmates of Nagpur University’s (NU) Boys Hostel at   sat on a daylong hunger strike on Sunday after the administration put up a notice asking them to vacate the premises by Monday.

 
 Warden Shyam Koreti called the students’ concern “a case of miscommunication”, and said no bona fide inmate needed to leave. “Students can stay till June 15. The notice has been put up for students whose exam have long ended, and they don’t have any other academic activity pending,” he said.
 
 Inmates claimed that vice chancellor   had granted them permission to stay for two more months after their terms ended in April. “We paid the charges for May and June. But, suddenly, we are told to vacate or we would be evicted forcibly on June 4,” the students told TOI.
 
 Koreti said no one is going to evict the students if they have permission from the VC. “Recently, we found that 12 persons were occupying a block illegally. After this, we put up the notice assuming that illegal person would leave on their own. We are aware that sometimes students get visited by relatives. For them, permission has to be taken and charges are recovered,” the warden said.
 
 The students countered Koreti’s claims, asking how is it possible for illegal occupants to gain entry when the powerful MSSC guards have been deployed at the entrance. “After the guards were posted, no outsider is able to gain entry. If illegal occupants are there, then what are the guards doing?” the students asked.
 
 They claimed that the   led by Pro-VC Pramod Yeole held a meeting on Saturday on the premises following which the “eviction” notice was put up.
