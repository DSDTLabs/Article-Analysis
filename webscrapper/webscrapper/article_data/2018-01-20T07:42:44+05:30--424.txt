 Mumbai: Reliance  , described by Mukesh Ambani as the world’s largest startup, has begun to generate profits in 15 months of its launch, helped by a 15.8% rise in subscribers and a sharp fall in interconnect charges even as rival   see their margins shrink. 
 
 Jio’s parent   ( ) said in a statement that the   unit posted a net profit of Rs 504 crore in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. It had recorded a loss of Rs 271 crore in the previous quarter. The company clocked revenues of Rs 6,879 crore in Q3FY18, up nearly 12%.
 
 Jio, which disrupted the telecom market with its dirt-cheap tariff plans after RIL invested over $30 billion, reported a profit despite a marginal drop in average revenue per user (ARPU).
 
 Mukesh Ambani, chairman and MD of RIL, said, “Jio’s strong financial result reflects the fundamental strength of the business, significant efficiencies and right strategic initiatives. Jio has demonstrated that it can sustain its strong financial performance.” With the telecom business generating profits, it could help Ambani take the venture public, as has been the speculation. 
 
 Excluding Jio and the retail businesses, RIL, with refining, petrochemicals and oil & gas as its flagship ventures, reported a profit of Rs 8,454 crore in Q3FY18, up 5% over Rs 8,022 crore in Q3FY17. The company’s standalone revenues expanded 14% to Rs 75,913 crore from Rs 66,607 crore.
 
 Jio was launched in September 2016 and had initially offered its services free for six months. It started charging customers for data in April 2017 but its rates have been much lower than its competitors. It, however, continues to offer free voice calls. The strategy helped Jio gain subscribers which, as of December 31, 2017, was 16 crore, making it the fourth largest mobile services provider after Idea, Vodafone and Bharti Airtel. The Jio move eroded margins of other telecom players with top operator Airtel witnessing declining profits for the last six quarters and forcing consolidation between Vodafone and Idea. 
 
 Jio earned an average of revenue of Rs 154 per subscriber in Q3FY18, compared to Rs 156 in the previous quarter. Operating profit rose 82% to Rs 2,628 crore while operating margin expanded to 38.2%. 
 
 Expenses at Jio declined about 7% to Rs 6,108 crore in the October to December period. It spent a significant amount towards network operating costs, interconnect charges — fees paid by an operator to its counterparts for allowing calls to go through — and depreciation expenses. However, its interconnect charges less than halved to Rs 1,082 crore after the regulator reduced the fee by 57% to 6 paise a minute from 14 paise in October 2017. The charges are set to further drop to zero from January 2020. Global ratings major Moody’s estimated that Jio may invest another $23 billion in the next few years as the company looks to build a digital ecosystem.
 
 On a consolidated basis, RIL reported a net profit of Rs 9,423 crore on revenues of Rs 1,09, 905 crore in the October-December period. Refining and petrochemicals businesses contribute 90% of the consolidated profit. “Our refining business has delivered 12 consecutive quarters of double-digit refining margins, demonstrating operating excellence and healthy industry fundamentals. Benefits of the large investments in petrochemical business are beginning to show with the segment reporting its highest ever earnings,” Ambani said. “We are excited about the prospects of both our energy and consumer businesses due to strong growth in Indian markets and constructive macro environment.”
