CHENNAI:   has claimed that city residents will not have to worry about   this year saying the current supply of 650 million litre a day (MLD) will be maintained until December. However, residents report drop in supply, or in some cases no supply at all, in several parts of the city including Anna Nagar, Virugambakkam, Kottur, Adyar, Taramani and Tondiarpet over the last month.

 The four city reservoirs now contain 2.9tmc water, which is equivalent to about 80,000 million litres. Of the 650MLD supplied in the city, 400MLD is drawn from the Chembarambakkam, Poondi, Redhills and Cholavaram reservoirs. “At 400MLD, the reservoirs can serve the city for around 200 days,” an official said.
 
 For supply on Wednesday, Metrowater drew 380MLD from the four reservoirs, 200MLD from two desalination plants in Nemmeli and Minjur and the remaining 70MLD through Veeranam pipeline that travels from Cuddalore to the city. Metrowater also has alternate sources of supply such as farm wells in Tiruvallur, Sikkarayapuram quarries and Porur lake.
 
 “About 180MLD can be drawn from farm wells in Tiruvallur if necessary. But there will be no need for alternate sources as we have sufficient storage in the reservoirs,” an official said. Compared to a storage of 2.9tmc this year, the reservoirs had only 0.3tmc last year, when the city faced acute   shortage.
 
 Kottur resident and Exnora south Chennai general secretary N V Ranganayakalu said, “There has been no water supply in several parts of Kottur despite complaints over the last two months.” Supply has been erratic in parts of Virugambakkam and Tondiarpet, while it has been consistent in areas of Mandaveli. “We have been receiving water on a regular basis. There has been no change in the pattern of supply,” said Mandaveli resident S Vaidhy.
