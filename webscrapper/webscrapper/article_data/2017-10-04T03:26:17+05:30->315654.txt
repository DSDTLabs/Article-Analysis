NEW DELHI: With less than one-and-a-half years left for the election season to begin,   and urban affairs minister   has asked officials of his ministry to submit the update on progress of actual work on the ground every fortnight.

 Puri, a diplomat, completed his first month in office on Tuesday. Addressing the ministry officials, he told them to “quantify and measure” the work and progress, a source said. He has also said now it’s time for showing results to the people.
 
 “Anything that can be measured can be changed. It implies that if we don’t monitor and measure the outcomes, the intended change may not come through” was his caveat to the senior officials.
 
 The minister also prioritised the outcomes to be monitored under each mission like the number of waste-to-wealth projects made functional and toilets built during the fortnight under Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) vis-à-vis targets statewise, numbers of water supply connections provided under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, projects completed in each of the first batch of 20 smart cities, affordable houses sanctioned and built under   (Urban).
 
 The ministry has so far approved about Rs 5 lakh crore investments and expenditure under new urban missions. He also directed that the National Rental Housing Policy and the Model Tenancy Act, under consideration for long should be finalised at the earliest.
