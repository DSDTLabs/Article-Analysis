Taking cognizance of a   filed by footwear company Bata India Limited, a Delhi court issued summons to actor Akshay Kumar, Jolly LLB-2 producer Fox Star Studios India Private Limited, executive producer Naren Kumar, writer Subhash Kapoor, actor Annu Kapoor, and others asking them to appear on February 22. The company filed a criminal defamation case against the team of Jolly LLB-2 for using “derogatory remarks and defamatory reference“ to Bata as a brand in the first official trailer for the movie. “ A prima facie case for commission of offence punishable under sections 500120 B IPC is made out and there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against all 10 accused,“ said additional chief metropolitan magistrate Sandeep Garg.

 In its complaint, Bata has claimed that in one of the dialogues in a courtroom, actor Annu Kapoor had been depicted to recite the following line, “Varna kya .....BATA ka joota pehan kar, tuchhi si terricot ki shirt pehan kar, sala hum se zabaan lada rahe hain.“
 
 “Immediately on the conclusion of the afore-mentioned dialogue, Akshay Kumar was shown to have slapped Annu Kapoor. Further while the dialogue played, the English subtitle to the same are appearing in the following manner: “Who are you to argue with me in your CHEAP SHOES and shabby clothes,“ the complaint states.
 
 Bata has said the official trailer of the movie was trending and had been watched in huge numbers.“The brand Bata has been deliberately shown in an extremely bad taste and the dialogue was intended to convey that Bata is adorned only by lower strata of society and one should feel humiliated if one wears Bata footwear,“ the complaint stresses.
