MUMBAI: A public relations professional has taken to social   to slam the   ( ) for seizing his cellphone and not giving a receipt after being fined for illegal travel in the luggage coach. 

 After he tweeted to the  , his message was forwarded to the Dadar RPF’s handle. They replied that the RPF never seized phones and told passengers in advance about not issuing receipts. “This is a blatant lie,” the   said.
 
 The incident took place on September 14 when he got off at Elphinstone station around 9.30am. He was carrying a first-class season pass. On being herded into a corner by the RPF with 60 other commuters who were found in the luggage compartment, he explained that the train had arrived on another platform, while he was waiting to board, and so he had to get into the luggage compartment to not miss it. He wasn’t heard and half of the group was hauled to the RPF outpost. 
 
 “After an hour, we were taken to the Mumbai Central railway court. Our group was herded into the court in three batches. The first batch was penalised Rs 500 each, the next was penalised Rs 300 each and the last (where I was) was fined Rs 200 each. The RPF took cash from us without giving receipts. When I tried to record the incident on video, I was met with a threatening stare. I was okay with being fined, but lost my cool when we were asked to leave without receipts,” he wrote on Facebook.
