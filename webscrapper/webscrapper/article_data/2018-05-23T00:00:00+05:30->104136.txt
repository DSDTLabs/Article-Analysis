Director   and composer   CS will be bringing two different genres — Carnatic and dubstep — for a song in Vanjagar Ulagam. A likely first in Tamil cinema,   presented this idea to Sam, who executed it perfectly. Manoj says, “I am an ardent fan of Carnatic music. There is an important action sequence in the film. We wanted to try a new sound for the same and I approached Sam with the idea of fusing Carnatic and dubstep. Sam has executed it well and the music has enhanced the visuals. Dubstep is something that has not been used much in Tamil cinema. It gives a different energy to the scene, which is why Sam and I thought it will work well for this scene.”

 The song,  , has been rendered by singer Swagatha S Krishnan. She says, “Director Manoj and Sam were working on a song that would appear in an action sequence. They wanted to experiment with the genre and came up with this. Instead of composing a song for the sequence, Sam focused on bringing out various emotions of the actor in that scene. And for this, he has used Ragam Dharmavati. The beauty of this ragam is that it triggers various emotions like pain, love, anger, revenge and so on. The lyrics, too, are written in a manner that goes well with the sequence. When you hear it, you might not really understand what the lyrics are all about. But when one sees it with visuals, the audience will understand why it was written that way. So, when Sam called me to record the song, I was surprised. But once you hear the song, it is sure to elevate your experience of the scene in the film. This is something one can definitely look forward to.”
