PANAJI:   has decided to move the High Court of Bombay at Goa for recoveries from illegal   in the state.

 Goa Foundation has recommended that the state government should form the Goa State Mineral Development Corporation to restart mining activities as that is the only way to ensure zero loss in the present legal framework.
 
 The foundation said that several states, including  , have issued orders reserving extraction of minerals for their own public sector bodies. 
 
 Goa Foundation also stated that proposals being made by the   (CAC) for issuing an ordinance are intended to return the mining leases into the hands of the private leaseholders. 
 
 The move will not survive judicial scrutiny or review, and it will also further delay restart of mining activity in the state, the foundation said.
