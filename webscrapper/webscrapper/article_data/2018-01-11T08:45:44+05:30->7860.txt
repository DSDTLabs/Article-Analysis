New Delhi:  , bleeding from a cut above his left eye following an aerial duel with  , single-handedly ripped apart the Delhi Dynamos’ shoddy defence as   romped home to a comfortable 3-1 victory over the Miguel Angel Portugal-coached side in a lopsided   ( ) match here on Wednesday.

 With Sachin Tendulkar, the co-owner of Blasters franchise, in the stands, the Kerala-outfit rode on Hume’s triple strike in the 12th, 78th and 83rd minute to ensure that Dynamos stayed put at the bottom of the points table. Another season of disappointment looms for the Delhii Dynamos.
 
 
 Hume, who was left bleeding following his aerial battle with Dynamos’ Rodrigues in the 18th minute, led from the front to set the perfect example of being a complete teamman. After briefly leaving the field to receive treatment, Hume returned with his head bandaged and left eye swollen to complete the unfinished task.The Canadian striker, who played the first two ISL seasons with Atletico de Kolkata, was at his menacing best, constantly breaching the rival’s defence with dominant runs from both flanks. He had put the Blasters ahead in the 12th minute with a brilliant sliding effort after the ball had deflected past Gabriel Cichero. Hume, who is the ISL’s all-time highest goal scorer with 26 strikes including the hattrick in this match, was assisted by a superb run from the left wing by Courage Pekuson.
 
 With the first session nearing its end, Dynamos restored parity in the 44th minute through Pritam Kotal, who was having an ordinary outing so far. Romeo Fernandes’ free-kick from the half line landed perfectly for Kotal to head it past the Blasters goalkeeper.
