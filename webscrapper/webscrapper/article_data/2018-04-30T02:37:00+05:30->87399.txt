Guntur: Concerned with the growing unrest among the public over the mishandling of Underground Drainage ( ) work in the city, ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) legislators have requested the in-charge minister Chintakayala Ayyanna Patrudu to urgently review the situation to set things right. Patrudu has will review the situation with senior officials next week. The municipal administration minister P Narayana has been requested to take part in the high-level meeting along with the principal secretaries and secretaries.

 Besides the slow rate of progress, the mismanagement of the works by the contractor firm has prompted legislators to seek the immediate intervention of the ministers. 
 
 Interestingly, about 10 of the 12 TDP legislators from the district, including a cabinet minister, reside in Guntur city. They have had to face the heat of the locals for the improper execution of the UGD work. “We have been unable to answer the public, as no one either from the firm or district administration is listening to us. This needs to be immediately rectified,” said Guntur west legislator Modugula Venugopala Reddy.
 
 Surprisingly, the UGD contractor has not taken any measure to provide relief to people in spite of repeated warnings and instructions by the district collector and municipal commissioner. The roads, for about 500 km, were dug up to lay the UGD pipeline. However, road restoration works are yet to begin, resulting in serious inconvenience to the public. Most of the roads in the city are broken and pothole-ridden. Besides, dust from rising from stone powder and fly ash, being used to fill up potholes, has made breathing an ordeal. TDP leaders are worried that the condition of the UGD work might adversely affect their chances of winning in the next elections. Works are expected to be completed by 2020.
