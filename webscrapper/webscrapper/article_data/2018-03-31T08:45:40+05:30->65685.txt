LUCKNOW: The two-day state working committee meet of the ruling   scheduled to be held from April 7 in Agra is likely to be extended. Apart from drawing up a roadmap for 2019 Lok Sabha elections in the wake of the party’s defeat in two bypolls, the meet was to focus on the impact of SPBSP alliance as well.

 According to party sources, the first working committee meet with   as the state president — and also first this year — needs some more time in the wake of rapidly changing political scenario in the state. The previous working committee meeting was held in Kanpur in October 2017.
 
 The two-day meet is being held at a time when the party is facing serious assault from Opposition as well as within, especially after twin defeats in   and Phulpur. Although BJP succeeded in snatching away a   seat from the combined Opposition, the jolt of bypoll reverses keeps haunting the ruling party.
 
 “Had it been a local defeat, it would not have been a major concern, but Gorakhpur was an impregnable bastion for us and the way way it has energized the Opposition by consolidation of SP and BSP, representing OBCs and the dalits, is baffling and compelling us for a new strategy in the run-up to the next Lok Sabha elections,” explained a BJP general secretary.
 
 The BJP sources told TOI that the party wanted some more time for holding the executive committee as reshuffle in the Yogi ministry was also under active consideration of the party high command.
 
 “Some people will get new assignment while some may be dropped from the government and inducted in the organisation. Once there is a clarity on this, the executive committee meet would be held,” they said.
