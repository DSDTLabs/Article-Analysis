PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has suggested to the national highway section in the state PWD to explore the possibility of using construction debris in road widening works as it will help resolve the debris disposal problems in the state.

 In a recent order, the division bench of   and Justice   observed, “We expect that the department will look at the wider picture to find a solution in public interest, and not get mired in administrative red-tapism.”
 
 The order related to a contempt petition filed by activist Aires   over alleged governmental inaction and continued dumping of debris and garbage along Panaji-Old Goa bypass road. The original public interest litigation (PIL) of 2007 regarding rampant dumping at the same spot had led to various orders and the government had assured action in the matter. Though the state government recently announced the sites for dumping debris, Rodrigues submitted to the court that public works department (PWD) has not erected sign boards earmarking the sites and dumping continues. 
 
 Advocate general Dattaprasad Lawande assured the court to look into the matter and inform the court about it. The matter has been adjourned to April 25.
 
 The judges have appended to the contempt plea a few matters, including one filed by activist   praying that construction debris be used as a base filling material instead of using the soil. Concurring with the view, the judges held that one of the best ways to deal with construction debris issue was to use it for construction activity, including highways and bridges.
