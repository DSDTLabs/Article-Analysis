AGARTALA: CPM   district secretary Bijoy Roy on Monday claimed that the 32-year-old tribal woman, who was allegedly killed by her in-laws at   in   on Friday night, was a victim of family dispute and there was no political angle involved in the incident. 

 Roy alleged that the victim's husband had a serious, ongoing family dispute with his brothers which ultimately resulted in the unfortunate murder of the lady. "The BJP is twisting the incident to derive political mileage. We condemn such an attempt and have requested police to take appropriate action against the culprits as per law," Roy said.
