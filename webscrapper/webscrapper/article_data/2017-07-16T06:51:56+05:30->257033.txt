All components of the building -pre-fitted with floors, water supply, wiring and air-conditioning ducts -were manufactured in a nearby factory and then transported to the site for installation. “This is an amazing believe-it-or-not project. The rapid construction concept will definitely help the state progress,“ said Siddharth, an engineer who had come all the way from Mysuru to watch the marvel.
