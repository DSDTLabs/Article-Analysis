Vadodara: Bahujan Samjwadi Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, who was in city to commemorate 100th anniversary of Mahasankalp Divas – the day when Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar vowed to fight for equality at Vadodara – slammed BJP as well as the Congress for ignoring the Sankalp Bhoomi in the Sayajibaug over the years.

 “When the state government which is ruled by BJP learnt that I am going to visit the Sankalp Bhoomi, they decided to hold the foundation laying ceremony there for the memorial,” said Mayawati, addressing a large public meeting at Kala Bhavan ground. “They never even offered flowers at the Sankalp Bhoomi, but now they are suddenly reminded of making memorial as the elections to the assembly are nearing,” she added.
 
 Mayawati said that if she would not have decided to visit the Sankalp Bhoomi, the state government would have never thought about the memorial. “The state government is afraid that scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward class voters will shift towards BSP with my visit so the idea of memorial came therefore the credit for it should go to BSP,” she said. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who fought elections as an OBC, nowadays does all kind of drama in the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar but he too never thought, as a chief minister, to build a memorial at Sankalp Bhoomi,” said Mayawati, adding, “When Mandal commission report was implemented, BJP withdrew its support, but the same BJP is now using the name of Babasaheb.”
 
 Asking the people in the audience to support BSP, Mayawati said, “Babasaheb gave constitutional rights but at the same time he said that they should also have the master key of politics in their hands if they want to take advantages of these rights.”
 
 BSP supporters held a pickpocketer. who was handed over to the police. The cops found three wallets and cash from his pockets.
