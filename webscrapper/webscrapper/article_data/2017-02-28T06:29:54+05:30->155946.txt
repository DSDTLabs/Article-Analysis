  According to a communiqué from the Raj Bhavan, Yadav has been appointed on a three-year term based on recommendations of a search committee for finding the new VC followed by interaction with candidates and consultation with the state government.

  Babasaheb   Bihar University’s political science professor Anil Kumar said Yadav was involved in social activities after his retirement. “He is known for his gentle and peaceful nature among friends and colleagues and is an able and accomplished administrator as well as a great team leader. It was due to his initiative that the NAAC awarded ‘A’ grade to L S College and R D S College,” Anil told TOI, adding Yadav had been associated with the ongoing preparations for the Champaran centenary celebrations in Muzaffarpur.
