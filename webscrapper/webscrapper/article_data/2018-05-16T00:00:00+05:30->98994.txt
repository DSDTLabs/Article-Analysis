Music nights in Chennai are always a hit and this musical event at a popular watering hole in the city was high on fun, energy, and of course, spirits! Musicians Manoj, Bjorn Surrao and   enthralled music lovers with their beautiful performances. The musicians played pop and retro hits like Hotel California, Despacito, with a Carnatic twist. We loved how people dressed up for the event — understated fashion, which simply worked for the city’s warm weather!
