Though known to be feisty and upfront,   has always maintained a stoic silence on her relationship with  , a London-based actor of Italian origin. 

 The two have been together for more than a year, and recently, there were speculations that the singer-actress is planning to tie the knot soon, as she has stopped taking up projects. What also fuelled rumours was the fact that Michael was spotted in South Indian attire, attending a function with Shruti and her actor-filmmaker dad,  . Previously, the couple had been snapped with Shruti’s mother,  , too. 
 
 When Bombay Times got in touch with the actress to clear the air, she replied with her trademark candour. She said, “Do you think I am the kind of woman who will give up work for marriage? Does anybody even do that anymore? The rumours are obviously being fanned by an archaic person, who has very little regard for the multi-tasking abilities of a woman; someone who thinks that all of us who marry have to stop working instantly. So, let’s first get that clear. Moving on, I want to clarify that I am not getting married this year, I am working. 
 Also, I will continue to work after marriage. I love to balance my personal and professional lives.” 
 
 Why has she been keeping mum about her relationship status? “My relationship is not a top secret mission. It’s something really personal and so, I am extremely protective of it. In any case, I have never had much of a personal life and I am fine with it. I have been in the public eye since childhood. My parents’ separation also put my sister (Akshara) and I under a lot of scrutiny. And then, ever since I started acting, every possible conversation with someone is assumed to be a relationship. I am not complaining, as I am comfortable with it. I knew from a very young age that this is a part and parcel of the profession,” she said.
