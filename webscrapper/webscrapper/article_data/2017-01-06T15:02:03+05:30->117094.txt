NAGPUR: In a fresh twist to the three-decade-old and yet seemingly unending saga of  , the state government on Thursday issued a resolution forming a six-member committee to finalize charges and modalities of works worth Rs 1,048 crore to National Building Construction Corporation Ltd ( ).

 The state government aims to rope in the company to arrest further cost and time overruns.
 
 The dam located at Paoni in Bhandara district on the Wainganga river has suffered a double whammy — political neglect that starved it of funds and later alleged corruption. It is now under the scanner of the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).
 
 The scheme has been given a national project status, the only one being implemented in the state, qualifying it for 90% of funds from the Union government. However, a plethora of corruption cases, mainly concerning huge cost escalations and also low quality in canal laying work, led to cancellation of 81 contracts.
 
 While the matter is also in high court where a bunch of petitions are pending, the government led by Devendra Fadnavis is concerned with the inordinate delay in the irrigation benefits reaching farmers in around three lakh hectares, mainly in the paddy belt of eastern Vidarbha. Generations of paddy growers have waited for the project’s completion in the hope that irrigation facility would enable double their crop.
 
 The GR issued on Thursday is a step towards firming up MoU with NBCCL, a decision on which was taken here at a Cabinet meeting on December 15 during the winter session. The move, if fructifies, could be a game changer not only for   but other irrigation projects too, sources said.
 
 It will be the first time that NBCCL, a public sector giant, will foray into irrigation works.
 
 The committee will fix charges to be paid to NBCCL and delineate scope of work, including tendering, implementation, supervision etc.
