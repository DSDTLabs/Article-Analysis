PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   (PCMC) plans to open an insectarium as well as a section dedicated to pheasants at its   Zoo in Akurdi.

 Sharing this information with TOI, Deepak Sawant, curator of the zoo, said, “There is no insectarium in the country. The zoo advisory committee of PCMC has approved a resolution for starting insectarium at the   at its meeting held on Friday. We will soon prepare the plan for it and send it to the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI) for its approval. If approved, it will be operational by March-April 2018.”
 
 Explaining the reason for choosing spiders for exhibition at the zoo, Sawant said, “There are 5,500 species of spiders in India, which help in controlling pests. However, people do not have much knowledge about them. People often kill them out of ignorance and fear. To create awareness about their usefulness, we will start this insectarium with an arachnid section.”
 
 Officials have shortlisted 22 species of spiders, prominent among them are fishing spider that is brownish red in colour. 
 
 Sawant said another new attraction at the zoo will be a pheasants’ section. “The zoo advisory committee has approved resolution for starting a pheasant section at the zoo as well.”
