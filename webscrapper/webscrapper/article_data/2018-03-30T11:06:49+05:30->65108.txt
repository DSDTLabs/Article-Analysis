GUWAHATI: The Gauhati high   on Thursday resolved to approve the proposal for setting up exclusive fast track courts for day-to-day trials of cases related to rape and murder of women and children in  . The high court's decision comes three days after a letter by chief minister   written to the chief justice of the high court requesting for speedy disposal of such cases. There has been a huge public outcry over the last week over a demand for exemplary punishment for the accused in last Friday's Nagaon gangrape and murder. 

 The court in its directive said, "An administrative committee consisting of chief justice   and several senior judges has resolved to approve the matter in a meeting held on Wednesday in the CJ's office at the court premises. The committee has decided to work out the modalities and submit a report in this regard within three days."
 
 Sonowal's letter to the chief justice had requested setting up a fast tract court to take up all cases of crimes against women on an urgent basis so that strict punishment can be delivered to perpetrators of such crimes. The letter had also expressed deep regret that society has to witness such grisly crimes even though women have traditionally enjoyed respect in Assam. In his letter, the CM lauded the efforts of the high court in setting up fast track courts to try cases under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, resulting in speedy conviction of poachers.
 
 Following the Nagaon incident, the state government has faced severe criticism over the spike seen in crimes against women in the state. People from all walks have taken to the streets demanding capital punishment for the culprits and prompt disposal of all cases related to crimes against women and children.
 
 Last Friday, a class V student was gang-raped and set on fire by a 21-year-old youth and two juveniles. The victim succumbed to her injuries on Friday night, setting off a chain of protests.
