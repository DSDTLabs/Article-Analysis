Rajkot: A 30-year-old woman suffered burn injuries when a man hurled acid at her in Himmatpur village near Bhachau town of Kutch district on Tuesday. The married woman Naseem Anwarshah Fakir was rushed to the GK General Hospital in Bhuj. She suffered injuries on her right hand and lower back. 

 The accused Abdul Shah Fakir, who is related to her family, stopped her on the road outside her house at around 9:15 am and asked her why was she not talking to him. Before the woman could reply, Fakir took out a bottle of acid and threw it on her. He even threatened to kill her and escaped from the spot.
 
 Fakir has been booked for criminal intimidation and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. “We are still to question the woman. But we suspect some family dispute or one-sided love that could have led to the attack,” said JB Chaudhary, police sub inspector, Bhachau.
 
 The woman has four children and her husband works as a casual labourer.
