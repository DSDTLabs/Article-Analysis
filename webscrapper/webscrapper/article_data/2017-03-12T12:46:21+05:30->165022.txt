MEERUT: It did not win a single   seat in 2014. Now with a vote share of 1.8%, or 15.5 lakh votes, and a solitary seat in the 403-member Uttar Pradesh assembly, Rashtriya Lok Dal stares at political obsolescence. Its marginalisation is so acute that even in its stronghold of  , it only retained a single seat of the three it held.

 The party, which looked certain to gain from the apparent Jat anger against demonetisation and the central government's handling of the job reservation stir, ended up humiliated like never before in its history, having won 10 assembly seats each in 2002 and 2007 and nine in 2012.
 
 Rajkumar Sangwan, organisational secretary of RLD for west UP , used political rhetoric to explain the result. “What   is to Muslims, Bahujan Samaj Party is to Dalits. So the electorate was left with no choice but to look at a third alternative,“ he argued.
 
 However, many party members feel social polarisation has forever dented the prospects of RLD as a political party.
