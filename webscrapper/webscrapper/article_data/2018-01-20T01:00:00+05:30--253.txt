After ' ', filmmaker Sanjay Jadhav’s latest outing, the action-packed ' ' (YRYRP), too, has enjoyed commercial success at the Marathi box office. 

 Speaking about the movie, Jadhav said, “My previous film, Checkmate, had a similar storyline but with a serious, intense presentation, which didn’t work for the audience. With YRYRP, I decided to provide entertainment with a hint of intrigue. Eventually, people said that they enjoyed the film as opposed to saying it was good. Nonetheless, my strategy worked.” 
 
 YRYRP also shattered the assumption that Marathi audiences solely prefer message-driven cinema over commercial entertainment. Jadhav explained, “The box office history of Marathi films — right from   to  , or films like 'Duniyadari', 'Lai Bhaari' and 'Timepass' — proves that people enjoy light-hearted entertainers, too. As a filmmaker, you need to make money and for that, you need the audience in theaters. What’s the point of making preachy films, if they don’t get people to the theaters? We need the audience to consume cinema on the big screen.”
