GURUGRAM: The Class 12   have brought bad news to Government Senior Secondary School, Khetawas. 

 Out of the 18 students who appeared for the exam, only three managed to pass, making it the worst-performing government school in Gurugram. 
 
 Speaking to TOI about the poor results, school principal   said, “The results this year are nothing to be proud of. My school has failed, only three students have managed to clear the exams. I don’t have the words...”
 
 The school has a strength of 100 students. All 18 who had appeared in the   exams are arts students as the school doesn’t teach the commerce and science streams. 
 
 The principal attributed the bad results to students not studying at home.
 
 “The kids don’t want to study. We have to force them to attend classes. As the students belong to migrant workers’ families, they tend not to study at home. How can they imagine clearing board exams on the basis of studying only in class?” he said.
 
 The school had a better performance in the  , which 10 students had managed to clear. “The results have baffled me, as more than half of the students had passed in the pre-boards. I do accept that there was a lack of seriousness on both the students’ and our sides. There was no shortage of teachers,” Yadav said.
 
 Similarly, out of the 15 Class 12 students from Government Senior Secondary School, Gwal Pahari, only six managed to clear the exams. 
 
 Nirmala Sheoran, the principal, also blamed the lack of self-study for the poor show. “We can’t do anything when students don’t study. All students belong to the migrant labourer class. How will they study? Their parents make them work when they go home,” she said.
