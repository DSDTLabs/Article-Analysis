THNAE: From last minute tips and pep talks to organising prayer sessions the   in lake-city have left no stone unturned to make their class X students feel comfortable as they begin with their   on Friday. 

 Though ICSE students have their own school as the exam centre, but still the nervousness remains. In order to make them feel easy and comfortable the teachers and administration of the three ICSE schools including Smt Sulochanadevi Singhinia High School, Billabong International High School and Hiranandani Foundation School (HFS) took additional efforts to ensure that their students didn’t face any difficulties while taking their exams.
 
 Ranjini Krishnaswami, director of Billabong School said, “No matter how prepared they are students are bound to get a little anxious before their exams. We called all our 83 class X students an hour before their paper and gave them a few last minute tips.” 
 
 “As the students under the   give their board exams in their own schools, the comfort level is already there. They don’t need to adjust to a new area and can spend the little time before exam relaxing. To help our 245 students do this, we arranged a little prayer service for them before their paper,” added Neelu Lamba, principal of HFS.
 
 “While our students have been preparing for these exams over the past one year and have nothing to be very anxious about revision of their lessons is very crucial for them. As not all of our 500-odd students may have a conducive and peaceful learning environment back home, we have allowed them to use the library premises for studying till late hours,” said Revathi Srinivasan, principal of Singhania School.
