When she signed up for director Guru Deshpande’s mystery thriller,  ,   had absolutely no apprehensions about the fact that it also starred   in the lead, along with  . “For starters, both of us have almost the same screen space in the film, even though we have only one scene together. But more importantly, the characterization for each of us is completely different. Hariprriya plays a character with negative shades, while I essay the role of the fun-loving Janaki, who is Chiru’s childhood pal, and eventual love interest. Janaki is a TV journalist and while that aspect of her is not explored in detail, she is instrumental in helping Chiru’s character solve the mystery in the tale. I also liked the look of the character,” explains Kavya.
Samhaara is the actress’ first film with the actor, which she says was a lot of fun. But she also sympathized with Chiru, who often had to work double shifts. “This was one of the most organized sets that I have been on. While I was on call during the day for my scenes with Chiru and could then leave, he had to stay back and shoot his portions with Hariprriya. The thriller was shot across Mysuru, Bengaluru and Mangaluru, with major portions in the coastal city. We were there in May, and while I am from Mangaluru, I found it crazily hot at the time. And to top it, my character had to do a lot of running or driving around town, so I was out in that heat,” says Kavya.
 The film also got her to work with Chikkanna yet again. “If Chikkanna is in a film, there are bound to be a few laughs. He plays a cop, who comes across as a serious police officer, but whatever he says and does is funny. He had the rest of us cracking up on set all the time,” she says.
