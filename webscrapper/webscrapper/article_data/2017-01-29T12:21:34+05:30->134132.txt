NAGPUR: “It is important that   keep straight records and books of accounts and comply with law and timely file TDS and income   returns, besides making advance  . This is needed for correct classification of income as capital or revenue expenditure,” said Rajesh Loya, a chartered accountant. 

 Loya highlighted implications of income tax on various practical aspects following demonetisation during ‘Chhoti Chhoti Batein’ organized jointly by VIA Tax and Corporate Law Forum and   on Saturday. 
 
 He also dwelt at length about cash credit and deposits in bank accounts and increase in sales after the union government pulled out notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination from circulation in November last.
 
 He explained laws on money laundering and its consequences if the income tax department conducted a survey, AIR, CIB, STR and FIU information gathering done by the competent authority. Assessees should not treat tax compliance as an year-end affair and check the 26AS (annual statement) frequently. The investor should be aware of classification of income in a proper way and be cautious in TDS compliance as non-deduction/payment results in disallowance and leads to unwanted tax liability, Loya said.
 
 Loya spoke on the new provision of taxing income at 75% and that too without any exemption limit if the source of income remained unauthentic. He also informed the gathering of quality scrutiny proceedings which is currently at 6%. 
 
 CAs Shailendra Jain and   spoke on VAT, service tax, excise and customs. Naresh Jakhotia conducted the programme that was attended by industrialists, professionals, students and public. It was followed by a question-answer session.
