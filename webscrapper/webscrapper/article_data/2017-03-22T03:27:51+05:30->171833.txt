NOIDA: Residents of the city can now look forward to submitting their electricity meter reading online or through SMS message by themselves instead of relying on line-men or power department officials to generate their meter readings.

 The process, called ‘trust billing’, was announced on Tuesday by Desh Deepak Verma, chairman of   ( ), to be implemented with immediate effect across the state.
 
 Under  , consumers having online billing facility can opt for submission of their meter reading to the licensee discom through email, SMS or at the discom’s web portal/designated office of the licensee. 
 
 The bill generation and payment are done according to the billing cycle prescribed by the licensee discom.
 
 However, the onus of submitting correct meter reading would lie on the consumers. UPERC said if a consumer submits a lower reading than the actual reading on the meter with the intent to reduce the electricity bill charge, action would be taken against such consumers.
 
  Consumers opting for this facility will have to get their e-mail address or mobile number registered with the licensee discom on the designated website. The move is expected to empower the consumer while promoting transparency at the same time.
 
 Mukul Singhal, PVVNL superentending engineer, said while the   power department is all set to comply with the directive, checking its results would be a challenge. “To check erring consumers who report understated readings or suppress actual readings, we will resort to surprise checks,” Singhal told TOI.
