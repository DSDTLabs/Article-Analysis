Jaipur: In a major correction, the enrolments in both public and private schools in the academic session that ended on March 31 have gone down from 1.33 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 1.32 crore. The fall came a year after the state added 3.20 lakh students in its kitty in 2015-16.

 A school report card uploaded on rajssa.nic.in also points out that a total of 2,558 schools were closed down in 2016-17 academic session including 2,524 government schools while only 33 private schools have seen closure.
 
 Terming it a correction rather than descent,   minister Vasudev Devnani told TOI, “Figures might show a negative growth but in real sense enrolments have risen. For the first time state has curbed the mass level duplication of enrolments in private schools and primary government schools,” the minister said.
 
 The minister explained that year-long child tracking system, submission of enrolment data on Shala Darpan and making Aadhaar cards compulsory for admission has brought much needed transparency in the system.
 
 It’s an established fact that at the start of academic session every school sees high turnout of students with full attendance. It, however, slides down as days and months progress.
 
 The downfall is also attributed to the poor performance by private schools. For the second consecutive year private schools recorded a negative growth. It has happened for the first time since private schools started making inroads in the state.
 
 The number of enrolments reduced from 59.44 lakh in 2015-16 to 58.16 lakh students in 2016-17. Damodar Goyal, an educationist supports minister’s duplication theory and argues that fall in private schools is largely due to the drop in admissions under RTE quota in private schools in 2016-17.
 
 “The state rider of giving admission to only BPL families in 2016-17 sessions saw RTE quota admissions fall by 2/3. It has decreased in the private schools by 2 lakh students,” said Goyal.
 
 The loss of students from private schools is going into the kitty of public schools. The integration of schools and Utkarsh Vidyalas has been a major attraction for private school students to move into government schools.
