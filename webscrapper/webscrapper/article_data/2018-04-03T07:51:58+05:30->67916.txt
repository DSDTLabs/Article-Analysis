KOCHI: The high court on Monday declined to stay a single bench’s order upholding central government’s decision to invoke provisions of   (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in  . CPM Kannur district secretary   is alleged to be the mastermind in the case being probed by CBI.

 Considering an appeal filed by first accused Vikraman and 18 other accused challenging the single bench’s order of March 15, a division bench asked CBI to inform its views.
 
 Seeking an order setting aside the single bench’s judgment, the accused have contended that it is the state government that has to grant sanction for invoking UAPA and not the central government. The appeal was filed through advocate  
 
 
 While ruling in favour of the central government’s decision to invoke UAPA provisions, the single bench had rejected the contention of the accused and the state government that sanction should be provided by the state government. The court had said that central government is the sanctioning authority for cases being investigated by CBI.
 
 
 In the appeal, the accused have contended that the single bench erred in holding that the central government is the authority competent to grant sanction for invoking UAPA provisions. There is nothing in UAPA to indicate that the competent authority to grant sanction is relatable to the investigating agency, it is argued.
 
 It is also alleged that the single bench also went wrong in holding that the contention regarding competency of the authority to grant sanction should be raised at the time of trial.
 
 Further, the accused point out they are being denied bail as UAPA provisions have been invoked and there is no chance of trial being completed in the near future.
