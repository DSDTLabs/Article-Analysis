PUNE: The   ( ) has decided to hitherto not grant permission for programmes like music concerts, TV shows and political rallies at the historic   fort here.

 Sources said the PMC’s decision comes after the controversy caused by alleged inflammatory remarks made at the Elgar Parishad, a public meeting held at the fort on December 31 last year, a day ahead of the Koregaon Bhima violence. The police had booked   MLA and Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani, Delhi’s   University (JNU) student leader   and six members of the city-based cultural group, Kabir Kala Manch, for their alleged provocative speeches and songs at the Parishad.
 
 
 However, the civic body has made no mention of the Parishad while announcing its decision to not allow private events at the fort. Sandip Khandwe, head of the PMC’s town planning department, said the decision was taken after the traffic police pointed out that private programmes at the fort always led to major traffic snarls on the adjacent   and Bajirao Road as well as congestion in the peth areas.
 
 Khandwe said the last private programme at Shaniwarwada was held on January 13. On an average, around 10 private programmes were held every month at the fort.
 
 “The venue does not have adequate parking space. Visitors park their vehicles in the bylanes around Shaniwarwada, which causes problems for local residents as well as for people passing through the area,” said Basavraj Teli, DCP (zone 1), adding that law-and-order problems could also crop up.
 
 The foundation stone of the fort was laid in 1730 on a Saturday, because of which it got its name. Today, little remains of the original structure that comprised additions made over the years to this seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire.
