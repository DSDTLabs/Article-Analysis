PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A total of 560 slum dwellers will soon get tenements on the Chinchwad link road under the   National   (JNNURM) implemented by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), as the state government recently issued a notification to zone the project as residential.

 The PCMC had planned to construct around 13,000 tenements at various locations, but it could construct only 6,500 dwellings, due to cost escalation and non-availability of land. 
 
 The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), in 2015, had found serious irregularities in the implementation of the PCMC project on the link road. Slum rehabilitation projects sanctioned between September 2006 and March 2012 were checked by the Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee in 14 corporations in the state including Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, Thane, Kalyan Dombivali, Mira-Bhayandar, Nashik, Nanded, Kolhapur, Sangli, Malegaon, Dhule, Amravati, Aurangabad and Latur. The CAG found irregularities in all corporations. 
 
 “As availability of land was not ascertained by the municipal corporations or their consultants before preparing the detailed project reports, an expenditure of Rs 5.79 crore incurred on consultancy fee towards preparing the DPRs proved to be ‘infructuous’,” the CAG report had then said. 
 
 Under JNNURM, the central government in 2009, sanctioned construction of 672 tenements on link road in Chinchwad at a cost of Rs 28.37 crore. The building plan was sanctioned in May 2010 on land reserved for sewerage treatment plant and vegetable market. The CAG report said the land reservation was not changed to residential as required under the Maharashtra Regional Town
