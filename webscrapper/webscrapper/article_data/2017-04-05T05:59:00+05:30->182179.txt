GURUGRAM: Prohibitory orders have been clamped and a huge police force deployed in   after a   by local residents, demanding a flyover from   to   camp, entered its fifth day on Tuesday.

 A doctor’s team was called to the spot — in front of Baba Naramsaad temple near NH-8 — after the condition of a resident on hunger strike worsened on Tuesday afternoon. As the news spread like wildfire, Pataudi MLA Bimla Chaudhary and former Sohna MLA Rao   as well as senior police officials, including DCP (south) Ashok Bakshi and ACP (Manesar) Dharmbeer Singh, reached there and tried to pacify the residents.
 
 Chaudhary promised to take up the residents’ cause with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. But the residents refused to call off the hunger strike and even threatened to block the national highway on Wednesday if their demand was not met. “Ours is a genuine demand and in the interest of the general public. Until the demand is met, the hunger strike will continue,” said  , one of the residents. 
 
 “A panchayat has been called on Wednesday morning at IMT Chowk, where we will decide our next strategy,” said another resident on hunger strike.
 
 Three residents of Manesar — Umed Yadav, Daya Kishan Nambardar and Subhash Bohra — started the hunger strike on Thursday. Residents of nearby villagers joined them with each passing day.
 
 “We have deployed a huge police force in the area and Section 144 has been imposed in one kilometre area of IMT Manesar with immediate effect. We hope the matter will be resolved soon,” Sandeep Khirwar, police commissioner, told TOI.
 
 It may be noted that a three-kilometre stretch between IMT Chowk and NSG camp is infamous for traffic snarls in week days and the local residents have long been demanding a flyover over the stretch.
