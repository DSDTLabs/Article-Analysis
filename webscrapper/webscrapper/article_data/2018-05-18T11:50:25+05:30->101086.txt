BENGALURU: With BS   taking over as chief minister of  , questions are being raised on whether he will pass the crucial floor test in the next fortnight to continue in power.

 
 But the bigger test for Yeddyurappa lies in the election of the new speaker, as he will play a crucial role in conducting the floor test and helping the ruling party overcome the possible hurdles thrown up by the antidefection law.
 
 “If Yeddyurappa-led BJP is not able to elect a speaker from its ranks, the floor test will prove to be a futile attempt,” says constitutional expert and   MLA VS  .
 
 The BJP government needs the support of at least seven more MLAs to ensure the election of the speaker of their choice, which now seems next to impossible.
 
 Conventionally, the longest serving member of the House will be nominated as pro-tem (short-term) speaker, whose role is limited to administering oath to all the newly elected MLAs and conducting the election of full-time speaker.
 
 Senior Congress leader RV  , an eight-time Congress MLA from   (Uttara Kannada), qualifies to be the pro-tem speaker this time. BJP’s Umesh Katti, another eight-time MLA, too is a contender.
 
 BJP sources, however, said they may not opt for Deshpande, but pick someone from their own party to smoothen the vote. The names of former speakers Jagadish Shettar, K G Bopaiah and former minister Visveshwar Hedge Kageri are already doing the rounds in party circles.
 
 Getting some opposition MLAs to abstain during the floor test is said to be one of BJP’s strategies and the speaker has reasonable discretion while dealing with complaints against such MLAs under the anti-defection law.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress is already ready with a counter. “We will field a candidate for the speaker’s election and will not let it go to BJP since we have more numbers,” Ugrappa said.
