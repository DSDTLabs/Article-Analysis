Pimpri Chinchwad: The general body of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation approved funds to procure 1,550 PMPML buses and bear operational losses, as well as allotted land at three locations to park the new vehicles after heated discussions at a special meeting.

 Dinesh Waghmare, municipal commissioner, PCMC, said, “PCMC will get 620 buses out of the 1,550 new buses. We can keep ownership of the depot land and give it for use to PMPML.”
 
 NCP leader Mangala Kadam launched a scathing attack on the functioning of PMPML in the meeting on Friday. “PMPML has just started preparing the business plan. Discussions need to be held on it at the general body meeting as PCMC is a stakeholder in PMPML. If PCMC bears 40% share of the cost of 800 buses, proportionate number of buses must be run and parked at depots in PCMC limits,” she said. Kadam also questioned the need for purchasing a bus at Rs45 lakh and if the bus of the prescribed quality would be purchased. 
 
 PMPML had purchased buses at the rate of Rs54 lakh per unit in 2012 under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme, but questions were not raised about it, mayor Shakuntala Dharade said. 
 
 Corporator Prashant Shitole expressed displeasure over PMPML sending officials to the general body who cannot answer the queries on technical matters.
 
 According to a proposal sent to the general body, PMPML has started the process of purchasing 800 buses using finance mechanism. Both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations will procure the buses. 
 
 The two civic bodies would also hire 550 buses from the Association of State Road Transport Undertakings, as well as 200 minibuses, Anant Waghmare, general manager, PMPML, said.
 
 The proposal said the expenditure on repair, maintenance and manpower would increase after the purchase of new buses.
