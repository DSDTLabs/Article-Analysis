BENGALURU: The government which has been pushing the   (RGUHS) to shift to temporary campus in Ramanagara, seems to have little interest in a research fund proposal mooted by the university. 

 It has been over three months since RGUHS — after the syndicate gave its nod — sent a proposal requesting the government to allow it to use some money from its corpus fund to set up an independent research trust. “We get hundreds of applications for research every year. While a large number of proposals are encouraging, a dedicated fund to help several of these ideas take off is crucial for both the university and medical research,” a syndicate member said.
 
 A few others TOI spoke to argued that RGUHS, which doesn’t get any financial assistance from the government, is being forced to spend money on a temporary campus in Ramanagara, while something as important as research is taking a backseat. The varsity will have to spend crores of rupees to move to a permanent campus later. 
 
 The RGUHS Act specifies that the campus should be headquartered in Archarakarahalli of Ramanagara district. But with 77 acres of the land locked in litigation, the government has been urging the university to move temporarily to the DC’s office. 
 
 Last week, over 50 principals of colleges under RGUHS moved court. “We have over Rs 700 crore in the corpus. And we don’t want it to be diverted to buy furniture or cars, but to help fund research, which is an integral part of any university’s functioning,” the syndicate member said.
 
 Medical education minister   said: “I was unaware of this problem. Now that it has been brought to my notice, I will look into it.” Medical education director Dr   said his role is only to advise the government if it seeks technical advice. “Until now, they’ve asked me nothing,” he said.
 
 Several statutes pending
 
 The government is also sitting on several statutes the university wants amended. Amendments of statutes like Establishment of Endowment and Prescription of fees in 2007 and 2010 are still pending with the government, while several others dating back to 2001 and multiple reminders in subsequent years are pending too (see box).
 
 A statute is made or amended based on the senate’s decision to do so, either on its own motion or on the synidicate’s submission. According to the RGUHS Act, every statute passed by the senate is sent to the state government for submission to the chancellor (governor). This needs to be done within three months.
 
 “While the government is so keen on the new campus, these are important decisions it is sitting on, notwithstanding the rules in the Act,” a source said. 
 
 TOI had reported on January 24 about how RGUHS may finally be forced to move to a temporary campus in Ramanagara despite the syndicate having vetoed the proposal earlier.
