 fans you have reason to cheer as the  ,   and   starrer Beyhadh, which was earlier reportedly ending its run in October, has now been extended till November 6.
  
 Actor Kushal took to his Twitter account to make the announcement.
 
  
  
 This will be second time that the series has got an extension due to public demand. Another reason that is being cited for its extension is that the show that was slated to replace Beyhadh's time slot is not ready to be aired.
 
  
  
 As known to most, recently Beyhadh took a five-year leap and we can't wait to find out what's in store. An additional member was added post the leap, Ayanâ€™s daughter who is raised by Arjun and Saanjh (essayed by Kushal and Aneri respectively) as their own. Only time will tell what the next few weeks will bring for the fans.
  
 The intense drama has a lot to offer and due to this it happens to be one of the most loved shows that are being aired these days.
  
 Keep your eyes glued for more updates as we will be back with more.
