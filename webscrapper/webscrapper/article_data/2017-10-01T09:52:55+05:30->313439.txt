CHANDIGARH:  's arrival has meant more parking trouble in sectors 7, 8, 15, 21 and 22. Many sweets shops in these sectors have encroached on parking lots to sell their goods, leaving only the road for parking at places. This has been happening even as parking continues to grow as a major problem in the city, especially during festival season. In these five sectors, owners of sweets shops have pitched tents in parking lots to exhibit goods.

 Sources in the MC revealed that though promenades between booths and parking lots have been allotted to shop-owners after charging a fee, they have not been allowed to take up parking spaces. “It is illegal to park there,“ said an official, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
 
 When contacted, mayor Asha Jaswal said she would “personally look into the matter“ and direct estate officials to not allow any illegal activity . “Shop-owners will be told to follow rules,“ she said. Though the enforcement staff of the MC removed one such tent in the parking area of Sector 7 on Saturday, similar shops in other parts of the city were buzzing with activity till late in the evening.
 
 This is not the first time that shop-owners are encroaching upon parking space during festive season. Every year, MC remains a mute spectator, while norms are flouted with impunity.
