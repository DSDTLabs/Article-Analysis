Ahmedabad: One of the founders of city’s prestigious music festival, Saptak, and educationist Himmat Kapasi passed away on Thursday evening. He was 88.

 Kapasi founded Shree Vidyanagar School with his brother in 1954. The school remained a centre of various cultural activities for years to come. It broke away from the conventional educational system. His school has produced celebrities who have excelled in music, literature, sports sand other creative arts.
 
 Fondly called Kapasi Saheb, he was a connoisseur of music, a film critic and sports enthusiast. He and his friend Nandan Mehta started the Saptak School of Music which hosts the festival. For years together, Vidyanagar School at Usmanpura remained the venue for one of the biggest music festivals.
 
 Shree Vidyanagar School also launched literary movements like Ray Math to deconstruct existing forms of poetry and prose. Eminent writers like Madhu Rye, Chinu Modi and Labhshankar Thakar also began their campaigns from here.
 
 Kapasi’s style of imparting cultural values among his students through arts and cinema was well-known. He always insisted on imparting a habit of watching good cinema among his students. In his school, students could even take a day off to watch a cricket march or attend a music concert. Kapasi also founded the New Film Society here.
