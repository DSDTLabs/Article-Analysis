INDORE: The Indore bench of   high court on Friday granted a stay on the removal order of Someshwar Patel from the post of chairman and member of the Madhya Pradesh Krishi Upaj   Samiti, Indore that disqualified him from contesting elections for a period of six years.

 Patel was issued removal order on the allegations that during his previous tenure as the chairman of the Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti there had been a scam regarding allotment of nine reserved quota shops at the mandi in 2011. 
 
 Patel through his counsel AK Sethi, challenged the order removing him from the post on the grounds that the MD of the state mandi board can only remove the chairman or the vice chairman of a market committee from his office for misconduct, or neglect or incapacity to perform his duty in his current tenure. 
 
 According to the complaint made against Patel, in 2009, nine reserved shops at the mandi were auctioned at Rs 33 lakh, whereas the same shops were auctioned again in 2011 at a price of Rs 9.75 lakh. Patel had been accused of accepting the bids in 2011 at a much lesser cost causing huge loss to the exchequer. 
 
 Although the allegations made against Patel are yet to be decided, the state mandi board issued the order removing Patel from his post on March 28 and also disqualified him from contesting in the elections of the mandi for the next six years. 
 
 Patel, in his petition, has told the court that as per the Madhya Pradesh Krishi Upaj Mandi Adhiniyam, the MD cannot take action against him in respect to the period which is already over. The petition will now be heard after filing of replies by the two respondents.
