MUMBAI:   has emerged as the top state in terms of total registrations (65%) of real estate projects and implementation of the Real Estate Regulation Act ( ). 

 As many as 16,125 projects have been registered in Maharashtra of the total 25,000 recorded under RERA across the country. The state has also turned out to be a frontrunner in terms of setting up of the conciliation forums and introducing the GIS mapping for the registered projects. Ahead of RERA completing a year since its introduction on May 1, a study released by property consultancy firm   has described Maharashtra as the only exception where the regulator’s proactive functioning has set new precedents. 
 
 “We are leading in registrations in the country as well as for implementation of a speedy redressal system with benches both in Mumbai and Pune,” Maha-RERA secretary   said.
