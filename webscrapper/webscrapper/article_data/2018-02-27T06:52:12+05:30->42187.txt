LUCKNOW: In cleanliness self-assessment,   has itself deducted 200 from the total score of municipal documentation (1,400) admitting that it will lose out on parameters like declaring the city open defecation-free and ensuring regular collection of garbage from houses and disposal to waste treatment plant. 

 With the Central Swachh Bharat team scheduled to visit the city on March 5 to inspect cleanliness in city, LMC is making last minute efforts to save its face. 
 
 LMC commissioner has instructed officials to maintain the tempo of road repair and cleanliness as it was during preparations for Investors' Summit. 
 
 Lucknow's cleanliness would be ranked on several parameters like   free status, waste treatment plant running to full capacity, daily collection of garbage, twice sweeping of market areas, etc. 
 
 LMC admits that it needs improvement in regular collection of garbage and has asked   Eco Green to ensure that no garbage is found on roads and is disposed at designated sites.
