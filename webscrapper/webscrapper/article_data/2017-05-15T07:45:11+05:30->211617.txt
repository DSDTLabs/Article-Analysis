KOHIMA: Congress will contest all 60 seats in the   next year, All   (AICC) secretary in charge of the state K Jayakumar has said. 

 Currently on a tour of the state, Jayakumar told a party meeting at Longleng on Saturday that Congress is ready for the elections, expected in early February next year.
 
 Saying that Congress is the only secular party in the nation, Jayakumar added, "If Congress is not brought back to power,   will become the land of satan and be destroyed." The Christian-dominated state has been ruled by the Naga People's Front (NPF)-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland government for almost 15 years. 
 
 Jayakumar slammed the government for failing on all fronts during this period and said he was confident Congress would get absolute majority and go on to form the government. He added that the state government does not even have the money to pay salaries but expects an easy flow of money by being in close proximity to BJP. 
 
 Jayakumar then asked how the people could let BJP, a divisive force, rule the Christian state, where people read the Bible everyday and where churches are visible in every nook and corner of the state. He said the state will lose Article 371 (A) and other special provisions if BJP's Uniform Civil Code comes into force. Article 371 (A) grants the state special provisions, promising the protection of customary law, social practices and beliefs of the people in addition to the resources of the state from any Union government intervention. 
 
 NPCC president K Therie said the NPF would be divided and their vote share would be reduced in the 2018 general election, giving a fair chance for the Congress to form the government.
