MADURAI: Two new units, the artificial limbs production unit and the braille and audio books production unit, were inaugurated at the Karaikudi   by the vice chancellor and professor, Subbiah on Saturday.

 In the department of special education and rehabilitation science, apart from special education courses, a separate innovative resource school for disabled is effectively serving more than 74 disabled students. Educational services along with physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy are provided to the students in need. Some students with motor problems are in need of splints, calipers and modified shoes. Realising this need, artificial limb production unit was started by the department. This unit will serve students with cerebral palsy and loco-motor problems. Artificial limbs, braces, shoes and other orthotics and prosthetic adaptive devices will be designed under this unit.
 
 In the braille and audio books production unit, the printed books will be scanned and converted as audio books using recent technological instant scanner and reader devices. The braille embosser will also be helpful for the students with visual disabilities to get braille printouts. The daisy players and recorders will also help the students to record and listen to lectures.
 
 Modular kitchen with modern cooking equipment worth Rs 9 lakh in the PG Menâ€™s Hostel has also been launched. The newly installed cooking equipment is highly efficient and can prepare 3,000 idlis within an hour. Facilities are also available to chop vegetables and prepare chapatis and other food items.
