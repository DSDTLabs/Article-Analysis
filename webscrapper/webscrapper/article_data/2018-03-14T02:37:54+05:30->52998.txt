NEW DELHI:   posted at Delhi Metro’s   station had a hard time on Monday when a   insisted on entering the premises late in the night. 

 While Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has strict instructions to turn away drunk passengers, in this case its personnel couldn’t simply turn the 25-year-old woman away for security reasons. They finally   her in a CISF vehicle to Dhaula Kuan   in south Delhi where her   was waiting.
 
 The woman reached the station — the northernmost and terminating station of the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre) — around 10.45pm. “She was alone and couln’t even walk properly,” said a CISF official. On being refused entry, she started arguing with the security personnel at the check point. 
 
 Soon a woman inspector of CISF was brought in to pacify her and CISF also informed Delhi Metro Rail Police (DMRP) and the Delhi Police control room. Delhi Police officials, however, said DMRP was supposed to handle it, the official said. “We then contacted her husband after taking his phone number from her. Her husband said he could pick her up from Dhaula Kuan metro station,” he added.
 
 The woman was then escorted to Dhaula Kuan metro station in a CISF vehicle and two CISF constables, including a woman staffer, accompanied her. “At Dhaula Kuan metro station, she was handed over to her husband,” the official said.
 
 CISF has become extremely strict against people who try to travel in the metro in an inebriated state following a few instances of harassment of women by drunk men on the premises. They are usually turned away from the security check point itself, said sources. “The incident on Monday, however, was different as the inebriated passenger was a woman who was alone and was travelling quite late in the night,” the official said.
