Vadodara: Amid brewing tensions between the US and North Korea, around 200 students of different schools of the city have sent a message of peace in the form of art to world leaders.

 The students, who are training at a city-based centre, have made paintings on a 200 feet wide canvas highlighting issues of terrorism and war. Veteran artist and teacher Kanti Rana got a booklet made in the form of a canvas carrying the works. Rana has sent this booklet to all heads of states and governments across the world as an appeal from all students who contributed in creating this art work.
 
 “When an appeal comes from children, even a headstrong person reviews his decision. And, when it is about maintaining peace, the world leaders are the first persons to make an appeal,” said Rana, who has been running the centre since 1969.
 
 The centre received a letter of appreciation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he received the booklet.
 
 He added that when the children had started painting, he did not give them any briefing. “I just asked them to visualize about war, terrorism and peace and portray their ideas on canvas,” Rana said.
 
 The recent project on peace is a second initiative done by the art centre. During the first Gulf War, then students of the art centre had first made paintings on the theme of peace, which were exhibited in New Delhi. 
 
 In 1991 too Rana had got a booklet made, which is now a part of library of peace materials at World Friendship Center in Hiroshima, Japan.
 
 On insistence of chief minister Vijay Rupani, the 200 feet wide canvas will be exhibited in Gandhinagar on September 21, the International Day of Peace.
