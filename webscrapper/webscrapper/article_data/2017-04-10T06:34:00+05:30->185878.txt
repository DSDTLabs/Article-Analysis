KOLKATA: Taking cue from last year’s experience, the   (NKDA) has begun undertaking various prevention programmes to tackle   and   outbreak this year. Zoologist and Burdwan University professor, Gautam Chandra, has been appointed as a consultant for the mosquito control programmes. 

 The NKDA will utilise the e-health centres, that it inaugurated in the township last year, as focus units to control dengue, malaria and other vector-borne diseases. 
 
 Each centre, located in three action areas of the township, has doctors and para-medicals along with testing equipment. 
 
 “We are trying to procure kits for blood testing facilities. These centres will be the pivotal for vector-borne disease control programmes not only in New Town but also the surrounding areas,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen.
 
 Chandra and his team have already surveyed the township’s water bodies and suggested methods for controlling mosquito larvae. While the team has declared the Eco Park water body free of mosquito larvae, it has asked the NKDA authorities to be watchful of the Bagjola and Kestopur canals that may serve as potential mosquito breeding grounds.
 
 They also distributed booklets on mosquito FAQs and do’s and don’ts in schools and among the township residents.
 
  (health) Pranay Roy said, “We are spraying larvaecide in all 41 localities and the awareness campaign will be intensified.”
