KOLKATA: The ministry of shipping will participate in the   only if it is offered 74% stake in the project. On Thursday, the matter will come up for discussion after   (KoPT) chairman M T Krishna Babu meets chief secretary Basudeb Banerjee. Other issues to be discussed may include dumping of dredged soil on Nayachar island, extortion by truckers of edible oil in Haldia and road repairs in Kolkata. 

 The Subarnarekha port, which is coming up in Odisha between Dhamra and Digha, has already posed a threat to the one in Tajpur. This private   may offer a better option to shippers than the proposed one in Bengal. “The Centre had sought details of the Tajpur port but they were not made available by the state government. The Centre had made its stand clear that it will not participate in the project with 26% stake. Ideally, a government agency should have majority stake and create breakwaters, carry out dredging and create other facilities for the port,” Babu said on Wednesday. 
 
 According to him, handing over majority share to any private sector is not beneficial to a government. There have been instances when private partners have offered returns that are far less than what the government could earn by holding majority shares. “In KoPT, we offer lower rates to attract vessels that are carrying out lighterage at Dhamra or Paradip before calling on Haldia. We are offering them transloading options at the sandheads,” the chairman added.
