PORVORIM: Town and Country planning minister   who has been facing opposition over inclusion of parts of St Cruz village into Planning development area (PDA), told St Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes that he will have to resign as legislator if he wants to out as the member of the PDA.

 Taking head-on those opposing St Cruz as part of the PDA, during ‘Zero hour’ on the last of the budget session, on Thursday,   told St Cruz MLA that he became member of the PDA as ex officio. If he really wants to out of the PDA, “You will have to resign as a MLA,” said Sardesai.
 
 Stunned Fernandes immediately said, “he doesn’t want to resign and has lots to do for his constituency.”
 
 The opposition to the Greater Panaji planning and development authority (GPPDA) is picking up heat. On Sunday, hordes of protestors from outlying villages of the planning area joined St Cruz residents in support demanding its rejection. From the public platform, Fernandes announced his exit from the PDA.
 
 Sardesai said the opposition to the GPPDA is uncalled for, and he too is in the favour of creating legit eco sensitive zones, and that those areas are protected.
 
 The   minister said though there have been protests opposing GPPDA, he so far has not received any memorandum. The activists have gone on directly “on confrontation mode,” said Sardesai.
 
 Taking potshots at former St Cruz MLA, Sardesai said she was member of the PDA twice. “When you are in the ruling, its ok to be part of PDA but once you are in the opposition, it becomes peda ( ill) ,” said Sardesai.
