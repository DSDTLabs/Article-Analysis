NEW DELHI:   yet again expressed his displeasure over absenteeism of   MPs when he ticked them off at the parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday while referring to low presence in   on Friday.

 Attendance tends to drop on Friday afternoons as MPs head back to their constituencies but this caused embarrassment to the BJP last week when a bill was being considered late in the evening.   is understood to have said that private member’s bills that are taken up on Fridays are an occasion for ordinary MPs.
 
 “The rest of the week belongs to the government. Friday is your time,” he is understood to have said while emphasising that MPs need to be present on all five working days in a week. 
 
 “PM said he is still not satisfied with attendance percentage of BJP MPs and that all of them should be sincere about attending   proceedings,” an MP said. 
 
 This is the second time that Modi has raised the issue of absenteeism among MPs as 
  also.
