What would have been a fun outdoor schedule turned into a nightmare for the team of television show 'Ek Deewaana Tha' —   Paul, Donal Bisht,   Chauhan and producer  , among others — when they got stranded in the outskirts of Manali following heavy snowfall. 
The crew members reached the hill station on January 1 (Monday) for a four-day schedule. However, as they prepared to wrap up the shoot and return to the bay on Thursday, heavy snowfall hindered their plan. The team, we hear, was stranded for around five hours.
 The show’s current track focusses on why Namik’s character continues to haunt   (Donal) and Vyom (Vikram).   Sharma told BT, “The track required a snow-covered location and so, we travelled to  , which is situated around 50-60 km away from Manali. As we were getting ready to return after the shoot, it started snowing so heavily that we could not drive further. The network was also down, so we could not reach out for help. The entire area was dark, and the snowfall continued. The situation was getting out of control when, fortunately, a few villagers spotted our car. Around 9 pm, they came with some blankets and food, and half an hour later, the snowfall, too, stopped. Together with the villagers, we shovelled the snow and cleared the the road. However, we could drive only at a low speed and it took us another couple of hours to reach the hotel.”
 Namik had to brave the snowfall for almost half an hour while shooting for a sequence. Prateek said, “On Thursday morning, we got to know that Namik’s body double will not be able to make it and so, he himself had to lie down under the snow for 30 minutes, as required by the script. He was breathing using a hollow wooden stick during this time. It was a difficult shot, but we somehow managed.”
 Thanking the villagers and God, the producer added, “If it were not for the villagers recognising us, we would not have been able to find our way back to the hotel.”
