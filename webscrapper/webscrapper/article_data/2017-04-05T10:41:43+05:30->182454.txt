VIJAYAWADA: It has been five days since the verdict was pronounced in the   but Vijayawada CP Gautam Sawang is yet to decide his next course of action citing non-receipt of the judgment copy though it is already in the public domain. The   verdict does not just acquit Satyam Babu but also holds the view that he was falsely implicated in the case by the police. 

 The HC verdict says the   had insufficient evidence to pin down Satyam Babu. It implies that Satyam Babu was implicated in the case only to protect members of an influential family. The prosecution purely banked on the fool-proof DNA evidence that they claimed to have conducted to establish Satyam Babu as the culprit beyond doubt. But the team of appellant's lawyers burnt their midnight oil and identified the loose ends in the trial court verdict which accepted the medical and scientific reports on their face value.
 
 Even now, the police continue to harp on nine cases pending against Satyam Babu. His lawyer in the HC refuted the police claim and said that five cases have already been quashed by the court.
 
 The chutney pounder, which was thrown into the bushes on December 27, 2007, was available at the place eight months later when the police arrested Satyam Babu who supposedly confessed to the crime. They even found blood in the almirah corner. The letter allegedly written by Satyam Babu was also held as bogus by the High Court despite prosecutors citing graphologist's report that the handwriting matched.
 
 Sources also mentioned that it is not easy to beat   after having an argument as she holds a black belt in karate. 
 
 "The letter was fabricated by the police. They even said that the handwriting had matched with that of initial suspect Gurvinder Singh alias Laddu," Babu's lawyer Pichukala Srinivas told TOI.
 
 After all this, it was a cakewalk for Babu's counsel to establish that the 'confessional statement made admissible in law as the same was made by him in the police custody.
