VASCO: The Mormugao Municipal Council ( ), which will commence a registration drive of pet   within its jurisdiction shortly, has fixed fee slabs for the same.

 Registration fees will be Rs 300 for large, hybrid dogs, Rs 200 for small, hybrid dogs, and Rs 50 for dogs of local breeds. The civic body hopes that the comparatively lower fees for local breeds will encourage the adoption of such dogs. 
 
 The Mormugao council will also provide a collar bearing the respective dog’s registration number for a minimal fee of Rs 50.
 
 As part of the process, dog owners will have to furnish an undertaking that their pets will receive regular vaccinations and be sterilised within six months. Applicants will have to fill and submit an application form, undertaking form and two photos of their dog. The age for the registration of the dog will be three months and above. 
 
 “Sterilisations will be conducted by  , while Mission Rabies has agreed to provide technical help,” an MMC official said. 
 
 “Registration is compulsory, for which we seek the cooperation of citizens. We hope that the move will help reduce the killing or abandoning of dogs by their owners,” MMC chief officer   told TOI.
