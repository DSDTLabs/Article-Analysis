JAIPUR: The   who had committed suicide late Saturday night was handed over to the   on Sunday morning.

 Brandwan Dhakar, a resident of Morena in Madhya Pradesh, was an undertrial and was arrested by Jaipur’s Pratap Nagar police a year ago under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).
 
 According to the police, Dhakar was admitted inside the jail’s dispensary and hanged himself there on Saturday. Chandrapal, elder brother of the deceased alleged Dhakar was severely depressed because he was falsely framed in a case of rape of a minor.
 
 “When I went to speak to him a few months ago, he broke down several times and said that he was depressed because he was sent to   without any fault,” Chandrapal said.
 
 He also added that his brother was married and has two kids. “He had come to the city only two days before he was arrested. The police could not find the main accused and instead arrested an easy target,” he said.
 
 The police handed over the body after post-mortem. “As per the law, a judicial probe has been set up in the case,” the official said.
 
 Meanwhile, the death comes as a major embarrassment for the Jaipur jail administration as it was the second death in a single day. On Saturday itself, a 66-year-old prisoner had died in the SMS Hospital. The police had called it was a natural death as the inmate   was suffering from multiple ailments.
 
 The family of the deceased had, however, alleged foul play and claimed that there were injurie on Wahid’s legs. The family members protested against the jail authorities and said that there should be an independent probe to find the real cause of his death.
