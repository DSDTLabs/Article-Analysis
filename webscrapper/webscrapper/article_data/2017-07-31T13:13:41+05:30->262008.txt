 VISAKHAPATNAM: Women have taken matters into their own hands and have been protesting against the New Jalsa   at Thatichetlapalem junction for the last 23 days.
 
 On the 23rd day of the protest on Saturday, women protesters along with some support from AIDWA-Vizag unit conducted a massive Vanta-Varpu protest, blockading the   for the entire day.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the protesters claimed that efforts were being made to reopen the   shop which had been shut down after the   order to shut down all liquor shops on the highway points was issued.
 
 The protesters noted that the liquor shop was barely less than 80 meters from the highway point and any efforts to re-open it would be a complete violation of the Supreme Court order which clearly states that the liquor shops should be at a minimum distance of 500 meters from the highway.
 
 When contacted, RN Madhavi, city secretary of AIDWA, said, “The repair works have been going on for a very long time. It is apparent that there is an effort to reopen this liquor shop and this bid is being vehemently opposed by the local women.” Sources in the excise department denied any efforts to reopen the wine shop.
 
 C Lakshmi, the main protester leading the women, said, “ We know for sure that their license has not been revived. However, we suspect that they are trying to find a way round the rules as repair works are going on and the old shop is being renovated.” When asked if any liquor was being sold at the point she stated that no liquor was being sold. The excise officials also maintained the same and categorically stated that the license had been cancelled.
