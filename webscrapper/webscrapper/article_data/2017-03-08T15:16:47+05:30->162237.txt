MUMBAI:  's   has been elected Mumbai's new mayor.   will be the 76th Mumbai mayor and will be taking over charge from Sena's Snehal Ambekar. Mahadeshwar defeated Congress nominee Vithal Lokare, who anyway had slim chances of winning, considering that the party won only 31 out of the 227 seats in the BMC elections. 

 After the procedural voting of the elected representatives for the Mumbai mayoral elections was completed a few minutes ago in the BMC house, the Shiv Sena's nominee Vishwanath Mahadeshwar was declared the next mayor with 171 votes defeating Congress candidate Vithal Lokhare who revieved 31 votes. The Samajwadi party's six corporators meanwhile abstained from voting while the MNS seven corporators choose to remain absent. 
 
 Even as the former alliance partners - the Shiv Sena and the   fought the 2017 Mumbai civic polls seperately yet the BJP corporators on Wednesday voted in favour of the Sena nominee Mahadeshwar. The Sena presently has the most number of elected representatives in the country's richest civic body - 88 while the BJP has 84 corporators. 
 
 By the show of hands the BJP voted for the Sena nominee as well as by signing in favour of Mahadeshwar. However it's pertinent to note that an independent Muslim corporator   who has registered herself with the BJP as a group, defied the party order to vote for Shiv Sena candidate in mayor election. She announced that she is not voting for any of the candidate. She denied the vote for the Sena candidate despite of the BJP's pressure.
