 Last month, the high court had directed the UGC to grant recognition to KSOU by applying the parity principle. It had ordered the commission to comply with its order within two weeks. But the KSOU claimed that despite communicating the high court's order to the UGC on December 13, the commission has not complied with the order. KSOU had approached the court last year, claiming UGC had refused to take a decision on granting recognition for 2017-18 despite repeated requests. 
 
  
 
 
  Justice K N Phaneendra recused himself from hearing a petition filed by former deputy chief minister and senior BJP leader R Ashok in relation to a case registered by the ACB against him pertaining to the bagar-hukum land allotment issue. The judge noted that as law secretary, he had tendered legal opinion in some of the subjects mentioned in the FIR and therefore it was not proper for him to hear the matter. The case will now come for hearing before another judge on Friday. Ashoka claims the ACB case was registered to settle political scores and to tarnish his image with the object of diminishing his prospects in the upcoming polls.
