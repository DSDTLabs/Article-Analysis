Kolkata:   Banerjee on Wednesday urged Karnataka leader H D Kumaraswamy of JD(S) to keep up the pressure on BJP and advised him to approach President Ram Nath Kovind if Governor Vajubhai Vala ignored his pleas.

 The West Bengal chief minister had earlier spoken to Kumaraswamy’s father and former PM H D Deve Gowda on Tuesday. 
 
 On Wednesday, she spoke to Kumaraswamy for over 15 minutes. Incidentally, after the conversation, newly elected JD(S) legislators announced a sit-in before Raj Bhavan in Bengaluru. 
 
 Banerjee, while stepping out of the state secretariat in Nabanna, refused to comment on the Karnataka situation. The CM said she would not speak on the matter for the day as she was busy with state-related issues. 
 
 According to Nabanna sources, Banerjee’s telephone conversation with Kumaraswamy revolved around strategies that could be adopted for the next couple of days. The talk took place in the morning among emerging indications in Bengaluru that BJP had gained the numbers to form the next government. Sources said the Bengal CM has asked Kumaraswamy not to give in to BJP’s pressure politics.
 
 A day before, Banerjee had said the Karnataka governor should follow democratic norms and call the Congress-JD(S) alliance to form the government as the two parties together had majority in the assembly. “There is a precedent in Goa and Manipur where Congress was not called to form the government despite emerging as the single largest party. So, it depends on the governor,” the CM had said.
 
 “But what I feel is that we are proud of our democracy. Let the democratic norms be taken forward. And I think because Congress and Deve Gowda’s party have already requested the governor saying they want to form the government together, we must give respect to our democratic set-up,” Banerjee had further said.
