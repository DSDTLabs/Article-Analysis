Pune: The staff of   Technical Education Society (STES) and MLA Medha Kulkarni met chief minister Devendra Fadanvis on Tuesday in Mumbai to address issues pending since the last 18 months. 

 The group, including students and teachers, that met government officials on Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction stating that they did not get a 'concrete assurance' from the government. About 8,000 teachers and students may be affected with exams approaching.
 
 Nine teachers and two students representing STES met Fadnavis. They sought the appointment of an administrator to probe the financial transactions at the institution. Kulkarni said, “The teachers have demanded payment of dues in lump sum, transfer of salaries into a nationalised bank and salaries by the 10th of every month.”
 
 The teachers said the CM merely wrote a remark on their letter for the chief secretary. They said they were dissatisfied by Fadnavis’s response as they felt the issue was handed over to the administrative officials all over again. Sachin Shinde, a teacher, said, “The government is trying to pass the buck. It is unfair and we feel as if we do not have any person responsible for us.”
