NEW DELHI: January 22 is the last day for taxpayers to file their returns in the   form, for the month of December.

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes last week had extended the deadline of filing the returns by a couple of days. The tax body had informed the same via a tweet through its official Twitter handle.
  
  
 The decision was taken in the 25th meeting of the GST council held in Delhi on Friday. GSTR-3B contains details of outward and inward supplies. The tax liability of GSTR-3B must be paid by the last date of filing GSTR-3B for that month.
 
 
 
 
 An important point to note is that some portions of Part B of GSTR-3 will be automatically populated from GSTR 3B file. So, in case there is any discrepancy between the two forms you can correct GSTR-3 later and deposit the taxes payable.
