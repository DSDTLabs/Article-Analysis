BHUBANESWAR: Several senior leaders of the All India   (AITC) will address a rally here on Tuesday in protest against arrests of AITC MPs   and Tapas Pal for their alleged involvement in chit fund scam. 

 Though the AITC was initially considering West Bengal chief minister and party boss   would address the Bhubaneswar rally, it aborted the plan after assessing that the response may be poor, party sources said.
 
 The Mamata-led party is holding similar protests on its home-turf Bengal besides Punjab, Bihar (Kishanganj), Manipur, Tripura, Assam, Jharkhand and Delhi. 
 
 However, the Bhubaneswar rally assumes special significance because the two arrested AITC leaders are lodged here.
 
 West Bengal ministers Somen Mohapatra, Partha Chatterjee, MP Subrata Bakshi and MLAs Manas Bhunia and Akhil Giri, among others, will address the meeting at Lower PMG, AITC Odisha convenor Arya Jnanendra said.
 
 The Trinamool workers, who staged dharna outside the CBI office on Monday, may repeat similar show in front of the probe agency office and BJP office on Tuesday, the sources said.
