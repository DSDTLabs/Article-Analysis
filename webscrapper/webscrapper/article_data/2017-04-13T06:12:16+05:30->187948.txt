PATNA: A   bench on Wednesday began the hearing on four writ petitions of   against the Bihar government’s decision not to renew their licences for production of industrial-grade alcohol from March 31.
 
  The Nitish Kumar government, which declared Bihar a dry state in April last year, on January 24 this year decided against production of industrial-grade alcohol as well in Bihar. The distillery owners moved the Patna HC, but the state government pleaded to the apex court to hear the cases of distillery owners along with other prohibition-related cases of Bihar pending before it.
  
  The SC instead on March 21 ordered the formation of an HC bench to hear the distillery owners and complete the hearing till May 10, according to principal additional advocate general Lalit Kishore.
  
  The HC’s special bench comprises of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon, Justice Ajay Kumar Tripathi and Justice Sudhir Singh. The distillery owners have pleaded that the state government did not have legislative competence to make any law with regard to the manufacture of extra neutral alcohol (ENE), rectified spirit or any other variety of industrial alcohol. They have pleaded that state can only regulate the manufacture of alcohol which is fit for human consumption.
  
  ENE is manufactured for exports and also for use in manufacturing of India-Made Foreign Liquor.
