KOCHI: The   national conference, being held in Kochi, has demanded to repeal the controversial Armed Forces (Special Power) Act ( ), which gives special powers to armed forces in ‘disturbed areas’. The delegates’ meet on Saturday passed a resolution demanding immediate repeal of the act and constitute inquiry commission headed by a retired   judge to probe the recent killings in Kashmir.

 The youth federation also demanded the central government to initiate dialogue with all stakeholders reversing the erosion of Article 370 of Indian Constitution, which gives special rights to Jammu and Kashmir. “More autonomy should be given to Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. The government should repeal the act by taking people of Jammu and Kashmir into confidence,” said M B Rajesh, DYFI national president.
 
 The resolution demanded ‘immediate cessation of inhuman methods being adopted by armed forces against Kashmiri youths’. 
 
 The meet has decided to amend the DYFI constitution to ensure that women constitute 20% of total members in all committees. In high-level committees like state and national secretariats, there should be at least two women, it said.
 
 Though the DYFI membership rose by 2.5 lakh in the four years, the organization couldn’t increase the pace of growth. 
 
 CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury will inaugurate the valedictory meeting of the conference on Sunday.
