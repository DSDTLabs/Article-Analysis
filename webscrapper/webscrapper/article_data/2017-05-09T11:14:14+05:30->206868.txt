PUNE: The Reserve Bank of India has, time and again, clarified on the issue of scribbled notes, but many businesses in the city still refuse to accept such notes in the Rs2,000 or Rs500 denomination. Their excuse? Banks don’t accept such notes from them.

 Ironically, it is a common practice among shopkeepers — especially local general stores — to keep count of the number of notes in a bundle by writing said number on the top note in the bundle.
 
 “Banks still accept notes with pencil markings, but bot notes with pen scribblings,” said Ashiq Iqbal, who runs the Supremo Corner eating joint on FC Road.
 
 The banks, while denying this, admit to accepting scribbled notes only from “our customers”. When questioned, especially as the   policy is very clear on this, banks say it takes them time to get such notes exchanged from the currency chest, and also that they get pulled up for sending too many such notes.
 
 The RBI urges the public not to scribble or write on notes as it defaces the banknote and brings down the life of a note. However, it has never expressly prohibited banks from accepting such notes.
 
 Another restaurant manager,   of Hari Mirch near JM Road, said he paid his employees in cash last month and both returned Rs2,000 notes after their banks refused to accept them.
 
 “So, we have also stopped accepting (such notes) from customers,” he said.
 
 The RBI has time and again issued circulars to state that there is no restriction on banks from accepting such notes, and that those which refuse will be fined Rs10,000. Despite this, the issue refuses to go away. 
 
 “Bankers can never say no to scribbled notes,” an RBI spokesperson told  , “They have to accept even fake notes and confiscate them as per our policy.”
 
 Rajkiran Bhoir, general manager for resource planning,  , said banks cannot say no to scribbled or coloured notes. “They are duty bound to accept them,” he said.
