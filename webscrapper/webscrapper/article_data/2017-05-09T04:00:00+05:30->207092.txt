AHMEDABAD:   police have questioned the three girls who had fled from Vikas Gruh in Paldi on May 3 night and were traced to   district on Sunday. Police are seeking to fill gaps in the chain of events and said the girls maintained that they took the chance to get out.

  The girls were sent back to Vikas Gruh early on Monday morning after questioning, said Paldi police officials. A group of five girls had managed to escape after opening the rear gate of the building. Two of the girls had infant children with them. Police are yet to catch two other absconding girls.
 
 “The girls said that they had stumbled on the unguarded gate and then had bent metal wires to escape. They first walked to Paldi bus stand,” said an investigator. “The girl from Santrampur, Aravalli, who was accompanied by her child, was sure that she would get refuge at her boyfriend’s residence.”
 
 The two girls accompanying her had nowhere to go as their boyfriends are in prison. They did not want to go back to their homes. Thus, they decided to accompany her. As for the other two girls who are yet to be caught, police said that their boyfriends had been recently released from prison and they may have accompanied the girls.
