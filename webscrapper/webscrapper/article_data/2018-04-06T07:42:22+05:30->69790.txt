 According to sources, the marriage will be solemnised at veterinary ground on May 12 and the ring ceremony may take place at a five-star hotel here on April 18. Though there was no confirmation of Lalu attending either the engagement or wedding of his elder son, sources said he might move a petition in court seeking permission to attend the functions.

 Sources said Aishwarya (25) has two younger siblings – a sister who studies in Bengaluru and a brother who practises law at Patna high court.
