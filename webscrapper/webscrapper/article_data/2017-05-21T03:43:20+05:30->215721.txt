NEW DELHI: After a spate of   thefts in the capital, police intensified investigations and the anti-auto theft division conducted several raids across Delhi. Their efforts paid off on Friday when they got information that a certain team of car robbers would be in Dwarka, Sector 10, to attempt yet another robbery. When the criminals drove into the area in a WagonR, the police teams flagged them down and arrested   men on the spot.

 The WagonR that the main accused, 26-year-old Vipin Kumar, also known as Chikna, and his two associates were driving in was discovered to have been stolen from Dwarka. After questioning them, a fourth person was also arrested. Anil, Sonu and Ravi are residents of Najafgarh.
 
 Police said that Kumar, called Chikna for his fair complexion, was an educated youth, who took to crime to meet the expenses of carrying on a romantic liaison with a popular folk singer of Najafgarh. Chikna got in touch with local criminals and quickly learnt the tricks of the trade, even forming his own gang soon after.
 
 The gang of four began stealing cars. Last month, they were on a joyride on their sports bike in north-west Delhi when they saw a man parking his new i20 car outside his house in Rani Bagh. The quartet threatened the man and the colony guard with a gun and fled with the car and the man’s mobile phone. The stolen i20, a Dzire, a WagonR, the sports bike and two 7.65mm pistols have been recovered from their possession.
 
 Surendra Kumar, DCP (South-West) said that a special team led by Rajender Singh, ACP (Operations), had been investigating the incidents of car-jacking. “While keeping tabs on potential suspects, the investigators used informers, collected criminal intelligence, analysed the modus operandi of suspects, and started tracking the movements of certain active gangs with the help of technology-aided surveillance,” Kumar said.
