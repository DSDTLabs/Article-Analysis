Bollywood actor   was part of Malayalam films such as Kakkakuyil, Kilukkam Kilukilukkam and Kalimannu. The actor, in a recent interview, divulged that he would love to do a Malayalam film again. He hinted at a film, that is on the cards, and even implied that director Priyadarshan might be able to throw more details on the same, saying ‘he would be the best man to tell you about it’. 

 He also added that it is a very exciting thing he is looking forward to. 
 
 He was all praise for Kerala, and he said that apart from the beautiful locations of the State, what he loves the most is the warm-hearted people he has come across. 
 Given that Sunil Shetty has been part of Priyadarshan’s Hindi remakes of his Malayalam films, one can hope that this film that he is talking about will be a fun riot as well.
