NEW DELHI: The   has asked banks, cooperative banks and   to report cash deposits from April 1 to November 8 in accounts where deposits exceed the limits specified after the government unveiled its decision to scrap high value notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 denomination.

 This means banks and cooperative banks will have to provide details of cash deposits of Rs 2.5 lakh or more in individual accounts. In case of current accounts, banks and post offices will have to furnish details of accounts where deposits are 12.5 lakh and above.
 
 Experts say the move is expected to help the tax department track the history of deposits in accounts as well as zero in on any suspicious or unexplained deposits during the   period.
 
 In yet another measure,   rules have been amended to provide that banks shall obtain and link PAN or Form 60 (where PAN is not available) in all existing bank accounts by February 28, if not already done.
 
 The IT department cited the RBI circular of December 15, 2016 which has mandated that no withdrawal shall be allowed from the accounts having substantial credit balance or deposits if PAN or Form 60 is not provided for these accounts.
 
 I-T dept to rope in auditors With an estimated Rs 15 lakh crore back in the banking system post demonetisation, the income tax department is in talks with leading global tax consultants, including EY,   and PricewaterhouseCoopers, for forensic audit of the data to see if any of it is laundered money.
 
 Following the note ban, as many as 60 lakh individuals and firms made large deposits totalling a staggering Rs 7 lakh crore in old notes. Also, with about Rs 4 lakh crore being deposited by individuals, the I-T department has raised quite a few red flags.
 
 The tax department is already armed with information about suspicious transactions from the   (FIU) about how much deposits have been made in dormant and Jan Dhan accounts, and urban cooperative banks.
