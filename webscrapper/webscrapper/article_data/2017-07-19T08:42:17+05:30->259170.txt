SURAT: Majority of traders questioned the role of Textile   Sangarsh Samiti’s (TGSS) convener Tarachand Kasat during the indefinite strike at the   convened by Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA) here on Tuesday and demanded TGSS’ dissolution. 

 Traders present said Kasat was projected due to the inner fighting between the two factions of BJP leadership in the city and he was used by powers that be to create disturbance in the movement. 
 
 Traders questioned Kasat’s political intentions when he knew very well that the government would not remove GST on fabrics and still went ahead to announce indefinite strike in the markets, which resulted in losses to the tune of over Rs2,500 crore to the traders’ community. 
 
 A textile trader Dhanpat Jain, who was part of the delegation that met Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in New Delhi on Sunday, said, “We were like uninvited people in New Delhi. Nobody cared to listen to our GST issues. He (Kasat) ran away from New Delhi on Saturday. But a few traders did meet the Union finance minister the next day.” 
 
 Jain added, “Kasat has nothing to do with textile traders as he is not owing a shop. He wanted to make political mileage out of the agitation. The general opinion of the traders’ community is TGSS should be dissolved and traders of all the 165 markets form their own committees to fight the GST.” Kasat left the STM board room because of the backlash. 
 
 Traders raised their voice against the legal existence of Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA) and demanded a fresh election to elect the new body of responsible office-bearers. 
 
 A textile trader Gajendra Rathod said, “The 15-day agitation by traders has opened doors for parleys with the government. After the next GST Council meeting, we must reunite once again and chalk out our plan for the agitation. We will not allow political persons to control our agitation, like Kasat did.”
