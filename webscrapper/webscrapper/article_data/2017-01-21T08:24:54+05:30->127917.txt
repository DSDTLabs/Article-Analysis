PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Unclean, tardy and inefficient — this was how a majority of commuters described the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited ( ), at a citizens’ engagement workshop in Chinchwad on Thursday.

 The workshop, being held to help shape the transport utility’s business plan, saw complaints ranging from buses not halting properly at stops even when they are running empty, the overall hygiene situation on the buses, and timeliness.
 
 Also highlighted at the workshop was the inconvenience faced by commuters between 1 and 3, when drivers and conductors halt the buses at various depots for change of shifts. This means the commuters are required to switch buses, resulting in chaos and confusion. 
 
  from Yamunanagar complained about bus drivers spitting out of the window while driving, spraying those in the front rows with spittle.
 
 Among other demands were a park and ride facility, which would benefit those who bring two-wheelers to bus stops wherefrom they travel on buses; an online booking system for passes; a strict enforcement of queues for commuters at bus stops, and a real-time tracking system for non-BRTS buses.
 
 PMPML chief executive officer   said some of these suggestions would be implemented immediately.
