Vadodara: Representatives of associations of parents of schoolchildren met the district administration demanding representation of parents in the fee regulatory committee of the Vadodara zone. The committee so far has only educationists, a representative of school management and others.

 The parents had been holding meetings and even raised the issue with the district education officer. On Thursday, they held demonstrations outside the district collector’s office and submitted a memorandum regarding their demands.
 
 Vadodara Shaher Vali Mandal president Bhavna Sapkal said that if there was no representative of parents in the committee, one would never come to know what actually transpired at the meetings. 
 
 “We do not want to support any unsubstantiated claims by parents. Even if a parent comes up with a complaint or objection, we will first verify it and then take it up with the committee,” Sapkal said. Another group Vali Vedna Samiti floated by Congress members also submitted a memorandum to the district administration regarding the issue.
 
 Sources amongst the parents said that they feared that the entire process may be an eyewash. With the committee being given a 90 days’ time to decide on the application for revision from schools and another 90 days for an appeal at the state level fee regulatory committee. By this time parents would have paid fees for two more quarters if the present system of allowing schools to collect fees as per last year’s structure was continued.
 
 According to representatives of parents, by the time the 180 days or six months get over, state elections would be around the corner causing more delay. “This has caused doubts if the intentions behind the new law were genuine,” said Sapkal.
