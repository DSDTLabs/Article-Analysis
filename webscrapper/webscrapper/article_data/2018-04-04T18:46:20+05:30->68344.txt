NAVI MUMBAI: In another case of mindless debris dumping, a holding   in Nerul has been converted into a ground in Nerul. Now, cricket pitches are being created on the ground for tournaments. The   ( ) has ordered a probe but activists have questioned why no steps were taken by the forest department,   or the civic body when land grabbers were reclaiming the pond.

 Navi Mumbai has 11   ponds, including this one in Nerul, adjacent to the creek. They were created to temporarily absorb high tide water as a buffer against flooding.
 
  
  
 
 “Over the last year, activists repeatedly brought the debris dumping to the notice of the forest department, but not much was done. The forest department has yet not filed an FIR,” said activist Anarjit Chauhan. 
 
 Navi Mumbai range forest officer Prakash Chaudhary, he said: “This pond, behind  , was under Cidco and NMMC. Last August, I had written to them about the debris dumping.”
 
  
  
 
 A Cidco official said since NMMC had ordered an inquiry, only the civic body can lodge a criminal complaint. “Also, Cidco has handed over the 11 holding ponds in Navi Mumbai to NMMC for upkeep,” he said.
 
 NMMC commissioner Ramaswami N told TOI legal action will be taken. Environmentalist D Stalin said: “At least 3 lakh tonnes of earth has been excavated from construction sites in Mumbai and surrounding areas in the recent past, and it is dumped at wetlands.”
