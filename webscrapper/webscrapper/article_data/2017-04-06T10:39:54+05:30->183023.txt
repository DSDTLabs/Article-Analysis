LUCKNOW: Senior   leader and former irrigation minister in erstwhile Akhilesh cabinet   met Aditya Nath Yogi on Wednesday. Hours after the meeting, the state government constituted a judicial commission headed by retired High Court judge Aok Kumar Singh to look into the Rs 1513-crore Gomti river front project of the irrigation department under the SP regime.

 Shivpal along with his son Adtiya Yadav reached the 5 Kalidas Marg official residence of the CM around 11:15 am. The meeting, that lasted 15 minutes, was described as a courtesy call by Shivpal. This was not the first time that members of the Yadav clan had called on the UP CM.
 
  Barely two days after Yogi was sworn in as the chief minister, SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s chhoti bahu   met him. A few days later the Chief Minister visited a cow shelter run by Aparna and her husband Prateek Yadav giving rise to rumors that Aparna was cozying up with BJP.
