PATNA: Seven bike-borne armed criminals looted Rs 3.82 lakh from Shubhkamna petrol pump at Sikandarpur near Naika Road under   police station in Patna district around 2am on Wednesday.

 The criminals entered the petrol pump and took employees Gopal Kumar (32) and Vikas Kumar (24) hostage and thrashed them mercilessly. Gopal and Vikas were sleeping outside the pump office. 
 
 Petrol pump owner Anuj Raj said the criminals used gas cutter and other devices to open the iron gate and entered the office building. They asked another employee Ramji (34), who was sleeping inside, to open the gate which was locked from inside. “Ramji did not open the gate. The criminals fired several rounds in the air after which he opened the gate,” Anuj said, adding that the criminals looted the money kept in the locker and fled.
 
 He also said the criminals damaged three CCTV cameras, the digital video recorder (DVR) and its online monitoring system. “But the police have retrieved the footage from the DVR in which three criminals are visible,” Anuj added.
 
 It’s the second petrol pump loot in the last couple of months. On January 4, three armed criminals had looted Rs 1.8 lakh in similar fashion but the pump was open when the incident had taken place.
 
 Fatuha police station SHO Sujeet Kumar said raids were on to nab the criminals. “Three empty cartridges were recovered from the spot,” he said, adding that three criminals involved in the earlier loot incident had been sent to jail. “We will soon arrest those involved in this crime as well,” the SHO said.
