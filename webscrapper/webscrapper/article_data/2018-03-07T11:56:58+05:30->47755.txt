TRICHY: A three-member team from the   (MCI) visited the   (KAPVGMC) attached to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) on Tuesday as part of the annual inspection to check the quality of education.

 The team verified the facilities available for providing theoretical and practical teaching to the   students from all batches. The inspection was aimed at assessing the quality of medical education to the students in the college.
 
 Ever since late chief minister J Jayalalithaa increased the quota to 150 seats from 100 in 2013-14, the MCI has been visiting the college every year.
 
 KAPVGMC had gone through a tough time in the past five years with limited faculty which the apex body had taken it seriously and even delayed its recognition. Thanks to intervention by the state government, it got recognition a few years ago.
 
 The process of headcount remained one of the necessary practices for MCI officials during their inspection. This was to check if the required numbers of faculty were working in the hospital and the college.
 
 A source said that the college administration managed to pass the headcount test conducted by the MCI team.
 
 Dean Dr G Anitha had already maintained that there was no shortage of manpower in the college for teaching and in the hospital for practice after the appointment of doctors.
 
 It was the second inspection of the MCI in a matter of 10 days. On February 22, a two-member team inspected the practical examination held for final year students in the college.
 
 A source said that the inspection may continue for one more day at KAPVGMC on Wednesday.
