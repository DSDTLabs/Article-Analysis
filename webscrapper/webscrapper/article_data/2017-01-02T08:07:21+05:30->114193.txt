  The protesters wanted the police to arrest the accused involved in these incidents including the murder of Karthik Raj, an engineering student, within 10 days. 
 
  Addressing the protesters that included a large number of women, Nalin Kumar Kateel, DK MP said there has been a spate of stabbing and arson-related incidents in the sub-division and police have not been able to bring the accused to book. "The culprits are indulging in hit and scoot tactics similar to what is seen in neighbouring state of Kerala and this is a cause of concern for all," he said. 
 
  Accusing the local MLA and minister for food and civil supplies and consumer affairs U T Khader of supporting such elements, the MP said BJP and Sangh Parivar activists will be forced to ramp up the agitation by staging a dharna in front of the Konaje police station if no definitive results are seen in the next 10-days. 
 
  "I will also draw the attention of the Lok Sabha and the Union home minister to such incidents happening repeatedly in the district and city policing units," he said. Acknowledging concerns raised by the protesters, a senior police officer told TOI that police have not been sitting idle and every effort is being made to trace and nab the accused. 
 
  "It is imperative that people have faith in us for we are dealing with humans and their devious minds," the officer said, adding it is not a simple case of arithmetic as the protesters make it out to be. "We have clues about the perpetrators and stakeholders will get to see the results soon," the officer added.
