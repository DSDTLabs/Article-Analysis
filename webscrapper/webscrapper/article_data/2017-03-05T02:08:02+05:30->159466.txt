VARANASI: BSP chief   on Saturday trained her guns on   and SPCongress, saying “gimmicks” like roadshows and Union ministers camping in Varanasi would not help her rivals in the polls.

 Attacking PM Modi, she said at a rally in Varanasi that he wants to clean the whole country but his own parliamentary constituency is loaded with garbage and filth. “BJP has not taken steps to clean Maa Ganga and she will punish   and his party in the assembly elections,” she said.
 
 Referring to the roadshows of Modi and Akhilesh-Rahul, Mayawati said, “I have been told that the crowd in both the roadshows was nothing in comparison to the crowd here.
 
 The nervousness of BJP can be gauged from the fact that it had brought people from other divisions and places like Bihar and MP to increase the strength of the crowd. In Modi’s roadshow maximum people belonged to places where polls are over. But outsiders don’t help you win.”
