MUMBAI: The   (BDS) which runs   near   is among the 1,200 trusts whose FCRA licence was cancelled by the Union home ministry.

 The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) licence is mandatory for trusts that seek and receive funds from abroad.
 
 BDS and its parent body the   (BDTA) have courted controversy over the "illegal sale" of church properties like Afghan Church, St Peter's Mazgaon and All Saints Church at  .
 
 Bishop Prakash Patole who heads the BDS did not respond to requests for comment.
 
 However, Rev P B Amolik who officiates for the BDTA confirmed that the BDS's FCRA licence was cancelled. "We failed to submit our annual accounts in time, and the period lapsed. Then the new government took office. Nowadays the authorities are very strict about enforcing the rules. But we will reapply (for the licence). This is not a permanent cancellation."
 
 Amolik said they receive foreign funds only from an organisation in Denmark for running an orphanage in Rajasthan. "For our day to day expenses we do not depend on foreign funds," he said.
 
 It may be recalled that the BDTA board was suspended by the charity commissioner (CC) in 2012. Amolik was dismissed and the CC appointed an administrator to BDTA. The trust office was sealed and its cupboards are reportedly deposited at the Azad Maidan police station.
 
 Activist Cyril Dara, who has fought a long battle with BDTA over the sale of church properties, said that despite his dismissal Amolik continues to operate the trust's accounts. Amolik denied this, saying he was paying employees' salaries "from his own pocket".
