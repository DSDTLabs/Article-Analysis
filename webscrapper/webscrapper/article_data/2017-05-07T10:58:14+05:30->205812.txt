 For the water conservationists, also called 'Jal Mitras', the way to drive home the message of water conservation doesn't involve any expedition or mass movement. The energetic youngsters plan to accomplish their mission in the next two months, starting mid-May. Besides delivering lectures, the team will stage nukkad nakat (street play) and present lokgeet (folk song), to reach out to masses. Dhananjay Chopra, who is leading the mission, said, "Our aim is to make at least 1lakh Jal Mitra who would, in turn, spread the green message. The campaign is called 'paani se dosti'." 
 
 The team possesses the data pertaining to the underground water level in various localities of the city and the state that fall under the danger zone. Only such localities or areas will be picked up by the team, said a volunteer of the team. 
 
 "To make things move at quick pace, we are asking students, journalists and AU alumni to arrange meetings to spread the message," said Chopra, adding that nukkad natak, folk songs like Alha in Bundelkhand, lectures and community programmes are some of means by which we will spread the message.
