The court found him guilty after the prosecution proved the case establishing the motive for the murder.

This had led to the murder. Aggrieved over the trial court’s order, Sudhakar went in appeal. The accused claimed that a sharp-edged broken metallic object of the windshield of the car had pierced her neck. Dismissing it, the division bench of justices   and A D   said that the explanation given by him with regard to the cut injury had been proved to be false.
