Rain water harvesting is need of the hour. Rain Water Harvesting is made compulsory by the NMC but majority of old residential buildings and flat schemes haven’t installed the system. Rain Water Harvesting System does not cost much. Also, NMC gives subsidy in property tax if one has installed Rain Water Harvesting system. Therefore, the association has chalked out a programme to promote it,” he said.
