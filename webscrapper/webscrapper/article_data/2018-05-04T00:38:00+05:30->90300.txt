Tirupur: A 77-year-old widow was murdered by her son, who has allegedly been suffering from learning difficulties, at Kangeyam here on Wednesday.

 According to police, Siva Shanmugam, 31, smashed her mother Saroja Devi’s head with some heavy object, killing her on the spot, after the duo picked up a quarrel.
 
 Saroja Devi, the police said, moved to Siva Shanmugam’s house at Kangeyam from Aravakurichi in Karur district after her husband Chellamuthu’s death.
 
 “Siva Shanmugam, who had recently gone missing from the house, had returned only a few days ago,” a police officer said.
 
 When their relative Mahendra Prasad, who used to help the duo, came to the house on Wednesday, he found that the main door was locked from inside. When there was no response, he peeped through a window and found Saroja lying in a pool of blood.
 
 He immediately alerted the Kangeyam police, who recovered the body and sent it to the Kangeyam government hospital for postmortem. The police also registered a case and arrested Siva Shanmugam.
 
 During the interrogation, Siva Shanmugam told the police that he killed his mother following a quarrel with her.
