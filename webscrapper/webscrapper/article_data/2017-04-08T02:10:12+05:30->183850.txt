GURUGRAM: Some of the biggest names in baking are in town for the 3rd India Pastry Forum. The event, being organised by the city’s Academy of Pastry Arts, features   Jean-François   and David Bonet, among others.

 The forum got under way on April 5, and continues till April 9 before moving on to Bangalore and Mumbai. In Gurgaon, the visiting chefs are giving master classes to 14 budding pâtissiers. And Chef Arnaud is impressed by the students’ diligence and dedication, and believes they don’t lack in talent in comparison with apprentice chefs in Europe and Asia.
 
 “The students are very passionate, and they work very hard, work long hours,” said Arnaud, who is based in Malaysia. “They work so hard that I want to stop them, but they want to continue!
 
 “In Europe, they’re ready to learn but they aren’t ready to spend the full day, to finish one session and then come back after dinner. So, it’s good to see this passion.”
 
 And artistically, Arnaud added, the aspiring pastry chefs are eager to know, and hungry to learn. “When you come back, you know the students are waiting for something new, something ‘trendy’ – they’re really passionate to participate.”
 
 Also passing on her experience and skills is Rumana Jaseel, a ‘cake artist’ who runs a bakery boutique in Kochi, Kerala. Each of these pastry chefs is offering master classes on pastry-making techniques both traditional and new-fangled, and bringing students up to date with international trends.
 
 According to   – director and executive chef at the academy – this is the first time that so many chefs of the level of MOF (  de France, a French award that recognises artisan-merchants in different fields) and master chocolatier, as well as world champions and Asia champions, have congregated in India
 
 Incidentally, the academy’s in-house teams have represented the country in the world’s top competitions, including the Asia Pastry Cup, World Pastry Cup and Junior Pastry Cup, winning a bronze in the latter.
