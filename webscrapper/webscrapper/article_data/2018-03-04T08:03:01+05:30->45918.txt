KANPUR: SP president   and his estranged uncle   came together at Saifai on Friday for celebrating Holi-for the first time since feud in Yadav clan broke out in 2016-but the uncle continued to ignore the nephew. 

 As   bowed to touch Shivpal's feet to seek his blessings, the Jaswatnagar MLA moved ahead without giving ' ashirdwaad' (blessings). However, Akhilesh exhibited full respect to his uncle and instructed the partymen to place a chair as soon as Shivpal reached the stage on the lawns at party patriarch   Singh Yadav's residence. 
 
 Mulayam had reached Saifai on Thursday to lead the festivities like every year at his home, but had to return to Lucknow after reporting of stomach ache. Akhilesh's other uncle Ram Gopal Yadav, one of the parties in the feud, however, was not present during the festivities.
 
 Addressing the modest gathering of clansmen and party supporters on the occasion, Akhilesh said, "They ( ) are trying to tag Hindu festivals with their party as if they have got patent for our Hindu festivals. But a very few people know that they played Holi in Barsana after covering their heads with polythene," Akhilesh said.
 
 "You all know how they had hired artistes in Ayodhya on the occasion of Diwali and presented them before the people as gods. They even decorated a government-owned helicopter and called it Pushpak Vimana," he said.
 
 Sources said that Shivpal had arrived at Akhilesh's residence along with son Aditya on Friday and spent time chatting with locals.
