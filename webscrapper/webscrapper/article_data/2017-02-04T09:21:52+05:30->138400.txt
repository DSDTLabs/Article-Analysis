CHANDIGARH: When campaigning for the state assembly elections ended at 5.30pm on Thursday, it also brought to a close the shortest period ever for the contestants to canvass, under the model code of conduct, shows a perusal of official data by TOI.

 By announcing the February 4 polls on January 4, the   had set the number of days for campaigning with the model code at just 29 days this time around. Though the time period between the two dates is 31 days, campaigning ends two days before the polling starts.
 
 During the model code of conduct, the poll panel keeps a close eye on all aspects of electioneering to ensure that there is no misuse of official machinery, and money and muscle powers are not at play. It is thus the crucial period which ensures a level-playing field and paves way for free-and-fair elections.
 
 The 29-day period is two days less than the 1977 assembly elections, when the Janata Party government at the Centre had dissolved the assemblies of nine Congress-ruled states in the country and the EC had given parties in Punjab just 31 days to campaign with the poll code enforced. At that time, the EC had made the announcement for the June 12 elections on May 10. Campaigning ended on June 10.
 
 Including this election, there have been only five times when parties have campaigned under the poll code for less than 40 days. Apart from 2017 and 1977, this period was the shortest in 1985 (34 days), 1992 (33 days), and 2012 (35 days).
 
 For the 11 assembly elections that have been held in Punjab since 1967, the average time period between the day of announcement of polls and voting day is 55 days. After taking into account the last two days when parties are not allowed to campaign, this figure comes to 53 days.
