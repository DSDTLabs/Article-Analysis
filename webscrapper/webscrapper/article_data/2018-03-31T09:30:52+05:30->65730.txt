NAGPUR: Hours before the HRD ministry and   declared that there will be no re-exam for Class X students, affected parents from the city met local MP and Union minister   today and sought his intervention. Parents who connected with each other through WhatsApp gave a memorandum to Gadkari and demanded cancellation of the re-exam for local students as the paper leak did not happen here. 

 Dr Sunil Londhe, a parent who started the WhatsApp group and led the delegation to Gadkari’s residence, said, “The moment we met him, he told us to be assured as a positive decision will be taken. Around 225 parents had gone to meet him.”
 
 These parents connected through WhatsApp and met at a public garden on Thursday evening. Following the meet, they formed a group and discussed strategies — from political intervention to knocking judiciary’s doors. TNN
