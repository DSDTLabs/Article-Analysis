The   state chapter had organised a two-day all-India seminar on `Disaster Mitigation of Floods and Urban Drainage' here on January 6 and 7. Last September, hundreds of people residing in areas like Nizampet, Kukatally, Alwal, Qutubullapur and Malkajgiri were affected due to severe flooding and inundation of low-lying areas.
 
 “Recommendations made by engineers from across the country were also taken into consideration,“ the Institution of Engineers (India) secretary and directoroperations of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), G  , told TOI.
 
 In the urban drainage manual, a few issues like design criteria for estimation of run-off and design of infrastructure components with appropriate design period (twofive years) respectively for road-side drains and primary drains have to be incorporated.
 
 The meeting also suggested setting up flood control authority in urban civic bodies vested with powers to control land use violations, encroachment of drains and water bodies, misuse of drains by solid waste, sewage and construction debris.
 
 They also recommended that storm water drains be designed with an integrated approach with management of solid waste, sewage and existing water bodies to utilise their retention capacity.
