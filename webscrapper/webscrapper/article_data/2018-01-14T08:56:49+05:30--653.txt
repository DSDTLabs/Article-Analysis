CHENNAI: Madras High Court Advocates' Association (MHAA) has urged Tamil Nadu government to consider offering premature release to all prisoners who had completed at least 10 years of their sentence, irrespective of whether other charges are pending against them or not.

 G Mohanakrishnan, MHAA president, said that a resolution to this effect had been adopted by the association's executive committee meeting on Thursday. The meeting also commended the Tamil Nadu government's reported decision to revive premature release scheme, and offer the benefit to about 1,600 inmates this year. 
 
 "People of Tamil Nadu as well as the entire legal fraternity are very happy that the state government had issued the orders to release the prisoners who have served more than 10 years," Mohanakrishnan said.
 
 Elaborating on the need to extend the benefit to every prisoner who had served the minimum stipulated years in jail, MHAA said trials in some cases would be prolonged due to variety of reasons including non-filing of chargesheet and non-availability of witness. Mohanakrishnan said: "The prisoners who had served more than 10 years in prison should not be penalised due to this embargo. We, therefore, request you to lift this embargo and release all the prisoners who had served sentence for more than 10 years irrespective of criminals cases pending or not."
