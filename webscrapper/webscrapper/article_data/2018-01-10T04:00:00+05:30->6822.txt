Surat: City police commissioner Satish Sharma has issued an order to cops to register complaints of senior citizens and women who are victims of any crime by visiting them at their houses.  City police issued a press release on Tuesday with regard to this standing instruction, which makes police service accessible to specific categories of people. Police have been instructed by the city police commissioner to visit the complainant’s house if the complainant happens to be younger than 15 years, a disabled person, a woman or a senior citizen above 65 years of age. This facility would be available 24 hours in a day for a disabled complainant and only during night hours for other victims like women, senior citizens and children below 15 years. Persons falling under these specific categories will have to inform police control room over phone number 100 or dial a number of a police station in the city. The caller would have to give his or her name and address for the police to visit the requisite place. “It has come to my knowledge that disabled persons are facing difficultly in visiting police stations. This is why this arrangement has been thought of by us. People coming under other categories will be provided this facility during night hours by the police,” Satish Sharma said.
