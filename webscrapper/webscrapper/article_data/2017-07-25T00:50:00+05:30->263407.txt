Nagpur: With a view to curb rash driving and check on teenagers riding vehicles without valid driving licence, the Nagpur   will launch a special three-day drive to take action against parents whose children are found violating rules. 

 TOI had recently published a survey carried out by SaveLIFE Foundation across 10 cities, which indicates that 56% people in Nagpur did not give a test for acquiring a driving licence.
 
 Confirming the news, senior PI (traffic) Jayesh Bhandarkar told TOI that if a child is below 18 years of age and is driving a vehicle without driving licence, parents will be held responsible for the act. 
 
 Bhandarkar said, “Booking parents can only check underage driving without licence.” Under this drive, we will conduct regular checks outside city schools and call parents on the spot if children are found driving without licence. “This would leave a greater impact on the parents who do not think before handing over a vehicle to their children,” he said. 
 
 “If an accident occurs, parents can even be punished according to law,” he clarified. Traffic experts feel this move will definitely curb the menace of underage driving.
 
 To ensure proper implementation of the drive, all the five chambers of Nagpur city traffic police have also approached principals of 177   to ensure that students, especially those studying in junior and senior colleges, possess a valid driving license. 
 
 Traffic policemen will stand outside educational institutions to nab violators. “First we will detain her/his vehicle and then call their parents,” said the senior PI.
