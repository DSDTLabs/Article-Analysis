PUNE: The city that prides itself as the '  of the East' is ironically finding it tough to recruit municipal school teachers. 

 Despite frequent advertisements, the   ( ) has not received a good response. A mere six people have applied for the 175 vacant teachers' positions.
 
 The PMC school board controls 330 schools which impart education in various language mediums including Marathi, English, Urdu and Kannada. Around 1 lakh students, most of them underprivileged, attend these schools.
 
 At a recent meeting, corporators across parties blamed the civic administration for mismanagement of the school staff. Non-availability of teachers, poor infrastructure and the absence of a dedicated governing body to monitor the PMC's education policy were the main points of contention. Corporators suggested that the PMC join hands with private players to improve the quality of education and teacher strength.
 
 PMC education officer   said a fresh advertisement for teachers was issued barely a few days back. He claimed that though the civic body has joined hands with NGOs, the move has failed to fill the vacancies.
 
 According to elected members, the PMC has planned to hike the salaries is pays its teachers in order to attract more applications. "A nearly 65% hike in salaries is expected. Low salaries are the main reason for the poor response. Teachers get barely around Rs 6,000 per month. The hike will give them around Rs 10,000 per month. The proposal has been approved by the standing committee," standing committee chairman   said.
