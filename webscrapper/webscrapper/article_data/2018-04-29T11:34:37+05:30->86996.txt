 “The deadline to submit an application will end on April 30. After that no further requests will be entertained. 901 colleges were asked to submit various documents like RLD/sale deed, fire safety documents, fixed deposit receipts etc. But for some reason they have been unable to provide these documents,” said   A, secretary, BIE.

 “If the colleges are able to submit a complete application before the deadline then it is fine. Else, students studying in these colleges will have move to other colleges. They can opt for nearby   that are doing better than most of the private colleges,” said Ashok.
 
 Speaking about the admissions for the next academic year, the secretary said that the process will begin from May 21 and warned colleges against enrolling students before the said date. “Parents should wait till the board releases the list of affiliated colleges so that they don’t face any trouble in future,” said Ashok.
