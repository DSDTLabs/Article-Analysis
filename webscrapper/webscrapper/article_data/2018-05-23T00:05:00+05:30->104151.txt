They say the best way to know a place is to walk around. Through tangled lanes, under a canopy of trees, past old shops and greeting friendly residents, a bunch of children walked around   recently, as part of a performative-research project, spearheaded by documentary theatre expert  . The task was to document the neighbourhood — not through a camera or notebook, but via their eyes. The participating kids were then encouraged to put out their experience in the form of sketches, poems, songs and stories.

  “The basic idea of the ‘Walking Around’ workshop is to inspire the youngsters to go out on the streets, look around and talk to people. But interestingly, it unfolded many stories for me too. There are so many localities — both residential and commercial — around the city. And each of these neighbourhoods have a unique history, intriguing legends and elements of living heritage attached to them. Unfortunately, though, we have become less observant now, and at most times ignore these everyday wonders that form the essence of our city,” says Anuja.
 
  Although Bengaluru has no dearth of performance hubs, another goal of this project is to break out of conventional spaces and make use of a wider canvas outdoors. “The first edition of this initiative, called ‘Dream Walkers’, took place on MG Road. We want city kids to interpret their place of living in a new light, by being more observant and walking more consciously. This also helps to rekindle cultural memory. There is a sense of adventure as small joys galore. Walking is also meditative, helping young minds to stay relaxed and more focused,” she sums up.
