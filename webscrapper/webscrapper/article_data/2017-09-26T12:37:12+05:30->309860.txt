TIRUNELVELI: A day after TV channels aired a news clip along with a video claiming that an explosion had taken place at the   propulsion complex at   here, police have denied any such incident at or near the high-security complex.

  SP P   said it was a piece of limestone rock that had slipped from  , a hillock about 15km from the ISRO unit, and not Mahendragiri.
 
  “Since there was limestone dust on the slope, the slipping rock resulted in a cloud of dust. This was confirmed by teams of forest and police department personnel who investigated the site on Sunday and Monday , “ he added.
 
 Soon after the news, special teams from the forest department visited the site on Sunday. 
 
 Since it was rumoured to be an attack by naxalites or extremist groups, the anti-naxal squad police were also pressed into service on Monday. 
 
 A senior police officer said the rock could have got heavier in the recent rains and rolled down the hillock for a few hundred feet. Samples were collected from the rock for chemical analysis to ascertain the cause of the incident that triggered panic.
 
 The police also said a bigger piece of rock at an even higher altitude is perched in a much dangerous position and may likely to fall down. It could create more noise and a thicker cloud of dust. They have appealed to the people of nearby areas not to panic if it happened.
 
 Meanwhile, on the directions of the ISRO authorities, a senior   official at Mahendragiri has lodged a complaint with   police in Tirunelveli seeking legal action against reporters who interpreted the rock fall as an explosion or an attack on the ISRO.
