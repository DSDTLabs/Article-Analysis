LONDON: A former employee of   has claimed that the controversial data firm undertook work for the   party in India and worked “extensively in India”.
 
 Christopher Wylie, who was a research director with SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, from June 2013 to July 2014, made the revelations during a lengthy statement he gave to the digital, culture, media and sport committee at the   on Tuesday.
 
 “I believe their client was Congress” he said. “But I know that they have done all kinds of projects, both regional and… I don’t remember a national project but I know regionally, they have. India is so big that one state can be as big as  . They do have offices there, they have staff there. I believe I have some documentation on India I can provide the committee.”
 
 Wylie had blown the whistle on Cambridge Analytica’s alleged use of data of millions of   users for political campaigns.
 
 
 
 
 Adding another twist, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, an IT expert, told the committee that Wylie’s predecessor at Cambridge Analytica, Dan Mursean, was working in India for Congress but had been paid by a billionaire to subvert the party’s chances. “There are stories starting to come out that he was working for Congress when he died in Kenya. Apparently he was really paid for by an Indian-origin billionaire who actually wanted Congress to lose. So he was pretending to work for one party while he was actually paid underhand by someone else.”
 
 “Cambridge Analytica was more of a concept and a brand than anything. It does not have any employees. It is all SCL Group,” he explained.
 
 “When you look at how SCL or Cambridge Analytica operate, they don’t care whether what they do is legal, as long as it gets the job done,” Wylie said.
 
 “There are a lot of reasons I find the company problematic. It’s not just the data, they are an example of what modern-day colonialism looks like,” he said.
