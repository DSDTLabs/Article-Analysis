NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Hours after the   district administration rejected a record number of nomination forms, a number of aspirants protested against the decision claiming that the district administration was indulging in casteism by rejecting Brahmin candidatures.

 CPM candidate Gangeshwar Dutt Sharma, who is a popular face in trade union protests and who also takes up issues of the slum clusters, left for Allahabad to file a writ petition against the cancellation of his nomination.
 
 Sharma, who was going to Allahabad, told TOI that his nomination was cancelled because of a pending case related to a protest by labourers who were sacked by the company in 2007. Nominations cannot be cancelled for pending cases, he said.
 
 However, SDM Dadri, who is the acting returning officer for the   constituency refuted the allegations saying that a checklist was given to all the candidates about the columns that need to be filled. Of the nominations filed by a total of 65 candidates in GB Nagar district on Tuesday, a record 28 were rejected on Wednesday. 
 
 In  , the nomination papers of more than half the candidates in the Sahibabad constituency were rejected on various grounds by poll officials on Wednesday.
 
  Sixteen of the 28 nomination forms from the Sahibabad seat, the largest assembly constituency in NCR, were rejected on Wednesday. The Sahibabad assembly seat comprises the Trans-Hindon areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara and Kaushambi.
