Panaji: To encourage research in agriculture, and promote a student exchange programme, Goa’s Ramanata Crisna Pai Raikar school of agriculture (RCPR), Savoi Verem, has partnered with Netherlands-based HAS university of applied sciences.

 The five-year agreement will focus on student exchange and faculty visits, joint exploration of common research interests and exchange of expertise. The two institutions are keen to start joint research on dried fruit processing, packaging, food chains, production of local cattle breeds etc. The memorandum of understanding was inked in March between chairman of the board of governors of HAS university, Dick Pouwels and chairman of RCPR school of agriculture, Manguirish Pai Raiker.
 
 “This MoU is intended to take full advantage of the education resources at both institutions and provides for the development of the education. Our college will benefit from transfer of advanced knowledge in the field on agriculture, training of our faculty in the modern techniques and new methods of farming, exposure to the new environment,” Raiker said.
 
 Students of RCPR will get an opportunity to study at HAS university where they will be professionally supervised by experts. Raiker added though the agreement was valid for five years, it could be renewed or extended. As per the agreement, students from HAS university will participate in common areas of research at Indian Council of Agricultural Research and RPCR to introduce international exposure on quality assurance, sustainability, and interdisciplinary approach.
