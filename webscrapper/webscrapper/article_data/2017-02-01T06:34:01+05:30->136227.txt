AHMEDABAD: The gold business is showing scant signs of revival after being severely hit by  . This is evident as gold imports have only marginally increased from last month. According to data provided by  , gold imports in January were nearly 70% lower than in the same period last year. Imports stood at 2.8 metric tonnes (MT) till Jan 30 this year, against 9.42 MT in January 2016.

 Estimates by city-based   and stockists indicate that cash crunch earlier in January and limited sales has led to a decline in imports. Normally , sales from November to February are buoyant due to the festive and wedding season. However, people are overly judicious in making gold purchases now.
 
 “People are prioritizing purchases because of limited cash supply . Moreover, the government action against frenzied gold buyers soon after demonetization has led to reluctance among consumers to make large invest ments in gold,“ said  , president,  .
 
 “While jewellery sales are good owing to the wedding season, the amount of purchases are limited to the bride. Moreover, old gold is being traded in against the jewellery and therefore, the effective sale of gold is relatively less,“ said a city-based jeweller.
