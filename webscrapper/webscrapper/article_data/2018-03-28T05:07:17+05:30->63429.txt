NEW DELHI: An informal group of ministers on Tuesday gave a go ahead to the proposal of rolling out robust schemes for procurement of   produce at minimum support price (MSP) to ensure every farmer gets the assured price. Sources said states would have the three options that they can adopt for different commodities. 

  TOI has learnt that ministers were unanimous about taking steps to "protect the interest of farmers" irrespective of its cost. The decision gains significance considering that successive governments did not work on ensuring MSP to   for all the 23 notified crops. Till now procurement of only wheat and rice at MSP was the focus. 
 
  A draft report by government's think tank suggests that though 82% of the total production crops is meant for sale, a large part of this is not sold in formal markets. It is assumed about 40% of the surplus is currently channelised through formal channels and this will need financial support. Now a small group of three ministers will work out the exact modalities of the three schemes before these come up for discussion in the   next week. The three schemes are Market Assurance Scheme (MAS), Price Deficiency Payment System (PDPS) also known as Bhavantar and Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS). 
 
    has suggested that MAS and PDPS scheme may be offered as options to the states.
