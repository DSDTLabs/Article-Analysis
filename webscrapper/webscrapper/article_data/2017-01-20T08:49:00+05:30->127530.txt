KALYAN: A 28-year-old man employed in   has accused a Kalyan   of harassing and robbing him of 600 Saudi riyal (around Rs 10,000) by claiming that it’s illegal to carry foreign currency following demonetisation. Also, when the victim’s friends threatened to expose the GRP constable, identified only as Sonawane, the latter’s colleagues allegedly offered Rs 20,000 to ‘settle the matter’. 

 Friends of the victim, Satish Chauhan, sent a complaint via text message to GRP commissioner Niket Kaushik, who said he would look into the matter. They will meet him on Friday and submit a written complaint. Kaushik did not take calls from TOI. 
 
 Satish had recently returned from Saudi Arabia, where he is employed as a labourer. After staying for a day at friend Jogendra Chauhan’s Kalyan home, Satish reached the station on Wednesday, around 10.15am, to board Godan Express to reach his hometown in  ,  . Jogendra’s brother, Umakant, accompained him.
 
 Umakant claimed that Sonawane, who was in uniform, approached them, checked Satish’s ticket and pocketed it. Later, he returned, took Satish to a room, which looked like the ticket collector’s office, and checked his bags. On finding 1,620 Saudi riyal in the bag, Sonawane advised him to exchange it for Indian currency at RBI claiming it is illegal to carry foreign currency after demonetization, alleged Umakant. He added that Sonawane told Satish to hand over 600 Saudi riyal else he would put him behind bars for possessing illegal currency. Satish complied. After leaving the room, Umakant called up social worker R K Yadav. “When Yadav confronted the personnel at the GRP station, they panicked and offered Rs 20,000 to settle the case. We refused, sent a text to Kaushik and returned home,” said Umakant. 
 
 Later, Sonawane and another GRP cop came to Jogendra’s house and returned the money to Satish. As Satish had to urgently reach his hometown, he left on Thursday, but his friends will pursue the matter.
