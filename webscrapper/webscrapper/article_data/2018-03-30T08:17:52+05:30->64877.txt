CHANDIGARH: Punjabi-origin Canadian citizen  , who triggered an international diplomatic row during Prime Minister  's India visit, says he has been thinking about joining politics. 

 While he may contest as an independent candidate in  , where federal elections are due next year, he is not averse to testing muddier waters of politics in Punjab. "If situation permits and I can get dual citizenship of India somehow, I would like to contest in Punjab," says the man who was convicted for attempt to murder former Punjab minister   in 1986. "I love India. It's the country I was born in," he told TOI on phone on Wednesday, adding that supporting the   idea and taking up arms for it was a mistake. "My gurus, my parents and forefathers were all born in India. I will not stop visiting India. I will be there," he says in response to the question if he would now be too afraid to visit again.
 
 While proclaiming that he is whole-heartedly for an integrated and united India, Atwal is, however, not keen to give detail of how he got involved in Khalistan movement or what led to his disenchantment later. A three-part series on him by a magazine and script of a Hollywood movie based on his life inching closer to reality are the apparent reasons for his silence on this topic.
