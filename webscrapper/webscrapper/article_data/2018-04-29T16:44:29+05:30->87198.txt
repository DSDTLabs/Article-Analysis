Getting a good opening is paramount to any film. More so, when it is a big release. Studios are constantly searching for the best release dates for their films so that not only do they get bumper openings but also don’t clash with other releases. Industry insiders were reportedly wary about a clash between Akshay Kumar’s upcoming release — Reema Kagti’s ‘Gold’ — which is all set to release on August 15 and Kangana Ranaut’s historical offering, ‘Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi’.
While Akshay’s film is reportedly based on independent India’s first   medal win in hockey at the  , Kangana’s film tells the story of Rani Laxmibai, one of the most popular figures of the Indian rebellion against the British in 1857. 
 Reports had suggested that the two big films were eyeing the same release date and would clash at the box office. ‘Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi’ has been written by ‘Baahubali’ writer Vijayendra Prasad and shot on an extravagant scale. The makers are hoping for the film to get a big opening across the globe and keeping in mind that Kangana has a huge fan following, have now decided to postpone the film by six weeks from its original August 15 release date. Although the shooting for the period drama is complete, a team of experts is currently working on the post-production of the film and giving it state-of-the-art facilities like Dolby Atmos Sound (a surround sound technology) and VFX. The release date is most likely to be September 28 now.
