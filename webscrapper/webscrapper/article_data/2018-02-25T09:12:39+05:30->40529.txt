 Tanmay’s wife   said that farmers were in the process of a stand on the issue. “They have dug the fields and spoilt the top soil. They cut trees which were not in the way of the canal. It has ruined the natural environment. All this is being done in the name of development,” she said.
 
 Bhattad said that the farmers had undertaken scientific contour farming. “We will not let the work begin until a logical discussion happens with the farmers,” said Bhattad.
 
 The executive engineer of the area PK Sharma said that the administration had talked to farmers on Friday. “We have acquired 34.02ha land of 59 farmers. There is no over acquisition. It is a minor irrigation canal to Wadona lake. 
 
 “The project is in the farmers interest. It costs Rs 17.33 crore. Total land under project is 500ha. If farmers don’t want development we will stop the work. We need to put the material somewhere so we have used some empty fields. There are no crops. Yet we will restore the land,” said Sharma.
