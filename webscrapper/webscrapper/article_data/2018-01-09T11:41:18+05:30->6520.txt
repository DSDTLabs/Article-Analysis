Actress-activist   has lauded the 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony for highlighting issues that matter to drive change.

  
  
 "This is how change happens! When a collective voice of reason unites to speak and stand by the truth. What a powerful, meaningful  ! Times Up, Me too. Oprah, thank you for speaking for every woman," Dia tweeted on Monday.
 
  
  
 The awards ceremony, held in Los Angeles on Sunday night, saw several celebrities speak up against sexual harassment and gender inequality -- issues that have been raging in   in recent times. Celebrities also chose to flaunt all-black ensembles and wore 'Time's Up' badges to signify a silent protest.
 
 Oprah Winfrey, who became the first black woman to receive the Cecil B. DeMille award, delivered a rousing speech calling for a world free of sexual abusers where nobody ever has to said 'Me too' again.
