HYDERABAD: As part of a student exchange programme,   (HPS) Ramanthapur is hosting 21 Polish students from   First Charter High School, Warsaw, for 11 days in the city. 

 The Polish students led by Bednarska school's founder and World War II survivor   arrived at the school on Friday afternoon and were welcomed by the principal along with parents and HPS schoolchildren.
 
 "To expand our cultural horizon and help students understand the dynamics of Indian families better, they will be staying with host families," said  , principal of HPS Ramanthapur. Elaborating upon the purpose of Goodwill Society's Expedition and Exchange programme, he said, "We also intend to explore the differences in the education system in the the two countries along with the cultural osmosis."
 
 Bartek Pielok, director and principal of Bednarska School, said, "Our school is a homage to   who gave refuge to over 500 Polish children in India post World War II. This exchange programme is the perfect way to live through what we have been taught in the school about Indian hospitality for all these years and we couldn't be happier."
 
 "We had started preparing a list of places we would like to take our 'adopted' Polish boy along, much in advance as the kids were constantly in touch. Our to-do-list includes taking him to our paternal place and ultimately treating him Biryani," shared N Manjusha, who is hosting 16-year-old Mashe. 
 
 The Polish kids matched the excitement level of the host families. "We are excited to be here and meet new people. I cannot believe even the parents came to receive us. I cannot wait to see what happens in these 11 days," said 15-year-old Paloma Ybarra.
