ITANAGAR:The All Nyishi Students' Union (ANSU) has served a 20-day ultimatum to education minister   to redress their grievances.   submitted a memorandum to chief minister   on Monday, claiming that their demands, which include adequate funds for development of schools, early release of textbooks, and an agri-horti college in Nyishi-inhabited area, were not being addressed. 

 
  The memorandum stated that it was decided in a meeting in October last year to declare vacanices in the posts of principal, vice-principal and headmaster in schools. 
 
 The decisions were also to be communicated to the chief minister and his deputy. Pointing out that these promises have not been met, the student body, led by president Toko Takam and general secretary Tukbom Ligu, threatened to launch a democratic protest against the department. TNN
