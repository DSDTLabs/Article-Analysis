HYDERABAD: Hundreds of teachers working in   model schools on Tuesday held a protest at the director and commissioner of school education office, demanding that the state implement service rules, and transfer teachers, by seniority, immediately. 

 The teachers said it was high time government provided them with  , and   for families of deceased teachers. 
 
 "Model schools were started five years back, and from day one, we have had to fight for everything. We were neither given leaves, nor did the government implement pay revisions. Only after a maha dharna, the state reacted in the past. Even now, for implementation of service rules and for issuing health cards, we have submitted at least 10 memorandums to the state, but nothing is happening," said B  , state president,  , adding that they are the only government employees who are not paid Telangana increment. 
 
 The protesters said many teachers recruited on merit basis are suffering because of lack of transfers. 
 
 "Most schools are situated at least 5 kilometers away from the mandal headquarters. There is no proper transportation available to reach schools. Because of this, many teachers leave for work at 5 am, and return home late into the night. If the government starts the transfer at least these summer holidays, some of the teacher's problems will be solved," said  , one of the protesters.
