Panaji: Taleigao villagers discussed the Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority proposal, but could not get the panchayat to move a resolution against it in chairman Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate’s stronghold on Sunday. The meeting, chaired by sarpanch Janu Rosario discussed several issues, but when member Pundalik Raikar took up the issue of inclusion of Taleigao under GPPDA, there was shouting from another corner of the hall. But Raikar said that instead of making a noise “we should understand that in the past ODP (notified in February 2006) for the village has thought of nothing else other than roads and buildings”. Annand Madgavkar’s resolution on coal transportation and nationalization of rivers was adopted while Xavier Almeida spoke about the need for desiltation of St Inez creek.
