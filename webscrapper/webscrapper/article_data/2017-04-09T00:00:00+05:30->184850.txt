Workerman chic is in from overalls, dungarees, bib coveralls and even jumpsuits. Here’s how to cover the fashion without looking like a mechanic. If you think overalls are for li’l kids or for gritty jobs, think again. Overalls may have started off as workmen staple, but achieved high-fashion status thanks to the ’90s hip-hop artistes. Then, it found itself being hung out to dry. And now, it’s back in your closet thanks to its new chic avatars. “What was originally invented as a comfortable but tough denim garment to be worn by construction workers, engineers and other labourers has, over the years, evolved into one of the most popular summer trends,” says designer Pria Kataaria Puri. 

 
 While full-length pants with attached bibs is the classic look, overalls with shorts, short skirts and long skirts in linen, treated denim, faux leather and cotton are in vogue. Designer Aniket Satam says that overalls are the best way to add a dash of cuteness and retro drama. “Denim dungarees are emerging as the new classic among teenagers. Wear them with monochrome tanks or classic nautical T-shirts,” he says. 
 
 
 
 The right pair can look just as smart with a flirty white crop top and sandals as it does with a full-sleeved woollen turtleneck. Designer Bhavana Pandey says that one should be innovative with the overall. Pair it with a shiny sexy formal top or leave a buckle open for a casual outing. “You can’t be missed in a crowd in a pair of overalls, so don’t over accessorise with jewellery or a loud statement piece. Dress it up or wear it down as per the occasion,” she says.
