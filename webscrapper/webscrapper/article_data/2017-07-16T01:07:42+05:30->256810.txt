GUWAHATI: The   ( ) filed a chargesheet on Saturday against chairman of the anti-talk faction of Ulfa, Abhijit Barman alias  , ‘commander-in chief’   and one other arrested cadre, accusing them of waging war against India.

 The chargesheet was filed before a special NIA court in Guwahati in connection with a terror case registered in 2013. While Baruah is based in Myanmar, Mukul is in the United Kingdom, NIA said adding that both have been declared absconders and further action initiated against them. NIA will now seek Mukul’s extradition from England.
 
 The NIA said it has collected sufficient material, technical as well as circumstantial evidence, against the accused persons during investigation and established the allegations cited in the FIR against each of the accused. The NIA chargesheet against Mukul formally confirms that he has been leading Ulfa-I since the outfit’s split and the arrest of first chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, who had signed a truce with the Centre for starting peace talks. Baruah had denied that Abhijit Barman and London-based physician Mukul Hazarika were the same person. Baruah said while the outfit’s chairman is Abhijit Barman, Mukul Hazarika is an activist of a human rights group called Assam Watch. Mukul has been identified by one of his bodyguards, Gagan Hazarika alias Joydeep Cheleng, who is under arrest and is the third person named in the NIA chargesheet, an official said.
 
 The ministry of home affairs had issued directives to the NIA two years ago to get Barman extradited to India to stand trial in a case in relation to Ulfa-I recruiting youths for waging war against India. He caught the attention of   after he made an open submission of the outfit’s proximity with China by seeking China’s ‘friendship’ to help it attain ‘sovereignty’ in Assam.
