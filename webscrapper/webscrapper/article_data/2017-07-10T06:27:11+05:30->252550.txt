BENGALURU: The streets of Richmond and Langford towns, which are otherwise packed with vehicles, were abuzz with activities on Sunday with pedestrians and cyclists making the most of Cycle Day and Composting Santhe. People across all age groups pedalled along the 3-km stretch, roller-bladed, and stretched out on yoga mats, thus reclaiming the streets. 

 The event was organized by the Citizen's Welfare Association (CWA) of Richmond and Langford Town, one of the oldest resident organizastions in the city, jointly with DULT (Directorate of Urban Land Transport) and the BBMP. "We are trying to address two of our main civic issues -- garbage and traffic -- by spreading awareness on the importance of cycling shorter distances and properly segregating and composting waste. This was a zero-waste event," said  , vice-president,  . 
 
 Participants tried their hand at pottery making, street games, participated in zumba, martial arts, yoga and meditation sessions. "We thought this would be a good way for the community to become aware of traffic congestion and garbage menace. Our MP (Bangalore central) P C Mohan has approved the CWA's proposal for upgrading   park from the MPLAD scheme. This park is in dire need of that; children's playground, toilets and pathways need to be repaired," said  , joint secretary of CWA.
 
  "This is a great way to promote cycling and sustainable living. There should be more activities," said Swati Rathi, a resident. The santhe included talks and workshops, stalls selling sustainable products, gardening ware and recycled products. Dr Meenakshi Bharathi, gyneacologist and civic activist, demonstrated how green alternatives to non-biodegradable sanitary napkins can be used.
