AHMEDABAD: Pakistan’s spy agency, the  , is apparently delighted with the social media posts of jawan Tej Bahadur of the BSF’s 29th Battalion who has alleged that essentials meant for them were being illegally sold in the market by their higher-ups and officers.

 “At sectors where Indian and Pakistani border posts are located opposite each other on either side of the border — such as some places in Barmer sector of the Gujarat frontier — the Pak Rangers taunt our men with jibes like, ‘If you are hungry, please come over. We have food here,’” a top   official (Gujarat Frontier) said. The BSF (Gujarat Frontier) has already ordered an inquiry into the social media posts of another BSF jawan, Navratna Choudhari, who has also alleged corruption. Choudhari is currently posted as head constable (ministerial) at Gandhidham, Kutch.
 
 A top BSF official claimed the ISI was delighted jawan Tej Bahadur’s social media posts.
 
 He added that while they are already conducting an impartial inquiry into the allegations of Choudhari, such posts on social media are damaging to a force considered the first line of defence. “The ISI of Pakistan and terror outfits operating from across the border are taking advantage of the social media posts of the Indian jawans, which demoralises the BSF,” said the BSF official.
