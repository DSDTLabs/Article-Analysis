LUCKNOW: Hemang Srivastava broke down as the men in khaki frisked him at Janpath Market on Thursday. The class XII student of a prominent school in Hazratganj was going home on his cycle when he was intercepted by  's  . "Despite furnishing my  , I was frisked like a common criminal," he said. He explained that he worked part time in a shop nearby. He was let off only after police had spoken to his father over the phone. 

 Like him, a class IX student of another school claimed he was harassed. "I had come to purchase books in Hazratganj and they started quizzing me in full public view. People started staring at me, some even passed remarks, labelling me a roadside Romeo," he said. 
 
 Rochak Ahuja, who works part-time as a teacher, was entering a Gomtinagar mall when some policemen accosted him and started asking for his name and address. "Now we can't even step inside a mall?" he asked. Likewise, Manas Jaiswal, was quizzed outside an Aliganj shop as he waited for his turn to be served aloo-chat. 
 
 "There have to be better ways to create awareness. Police should raid places known to be frequented by ruffians," he said. Anand Pandey, who was on his way home as he took the road of Mount Carmel School, was quizzed by police. He threatened them with filing a public interest litigation against this move. 
 
 Police officials, however, denied harassment. They said only those who were behaving suspiciously and had refused to cooperate were quizzed or frisked.
