Margao: Police are still on the look-out for Aquem Baixo resident Faiyaz Khatib, 36, who allegedly shot at Ravanfond resident Abdul Kader, 42, in a bar at Shantinagar, on Tuesday afternoon, leading to his death. Both are natives of Karnataka. The two-wheeler that Khatib had used to flee the spot after committing the crime was found abandoned by the roadside at Sinquetim, Navelim, on Wednesday. Police are still clueless over the motive behind the murder, and are yet to determine whether it was premeditated. Sources said the victim was known to Khatib, who locals describe as a kind and good-natured person.  On Tuesday, Khatib shot Kader dead at point blank using a country-made firearm, and escaped on his two-wheeler along with the firearm. Police are yet to recover the weapon. Kader worked as a stone-dresser at construction sites, while Khatib is a much sought-after mechanic, a source said.
