 is just a week away from the finale and is witnessing a crucial stage. Any wrong move by the contestants can cause them the trophy. The stress levels are high in the house and the contestants are finding it difficult to handle it.
 
  One of the recent incident took place when Bani had a major emotional breakdown during a task. On day 99, Bigg Boss asks Manveer, Lopa, Rohan and Bani to gather in the finale room which is adjoining the garden area.
  
  
 
  
  Inside, they are made to sit in front of a TV screen flashing Grand Finale on it and are asked to evaluate their performance on the show. Basis all their pros and cons, they have to draw a conclusion as to who will stay in the grand finale and who will get evicted and in what order. After they decide on the order, contestants have to leave the finale room in that particular order once the signature tune of the show rings. Lopa and Rohan begin targeting Bani and wherein they say that Bani deserves to go out because she has not contributed to any task and has always given up.
  
  Manveer, however, says that he will any day choose Bani over Rohan as she has been sensible while performing the task.
  
  Just then, Lopa interrupts the conversation, and says that Bani has always been impulsive the tasks and the phone booth task was terminated because of her stupidity. Bani takes offence to this and says that they always target her, call her impulsive, roadside for no reason. She ends the conversation by saying that she can’t take their nonsense anymore and it’s better that she leaves the room.
  
  She bursts into tears and bangs the door and leaves the room.
