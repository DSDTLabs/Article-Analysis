NAGPUR: “The day members of Parliament raised their own salaries by mere raising of hands in Parliament was a Black Day for me,” said  , BJP MP from Sultanpur in  . “I was the only MP to oppose the move,” he added.

 Addressing a youth summit organized by pro-OBC groups in the city, the young MP said when almost one third of population was reeling under poverty in several states, it was unfair to raise salaries of MPs. He said for the last year he has been donating his full salary every month to the needy or for some worthy cause.
 
 “I am not in Parliament to get a road sanctioned or a nullah cleaned in my constituency. I am there to see that India of my dreams is realized some day,” he said in an inspiring speech. Giving live examples of people who made difference in the society, he said every individual can bring about the change that is desired. He gave instance of how a young boy, Babar Ali, of a village in Murshidabad in West Bengal went to school alone from his village but later taught others in spare time. He was given a $2 lakh reward by   which he used to set up a school providing free education to 6,000 students. Today Murshidabad has transformed into an education hub.
 
 “Let not money and comfort be only motivations of your life. Instead earn blessings, goodwill and respect of society,” he told youth amid applause for his easy and lucid oration.
