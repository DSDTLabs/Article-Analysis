VISAKHAPATNAM: The   evoked mixed reactions from all political quarters in the district on Wednesday. 

 While the ruling parties and its ally welcomed the budget, the Opposition parties took potshots at Jaitley and the BJP. 
 
 Rajya Sabha member T Subbarami Reddy said the budget had neglected the poor people. “Fund allocations were not done on a priority basis. The government also did not mention the railway zone. This budget is nothing but a gimmick of numbers,” he alleged. 
 
 CPM state secretariat member Ch Narsinga Rao said allocations for the Polavaram project which costs around Rs 36,000 crore was insufficient. There are also no funds allocated for the backward regions such as Rayalaseema or North Andhra. The railway has lost its priority following the merger of its budget with the general budget. As a whole, injustice was done to the people of AP, he said. 
 
 CPM district secretary K Lokanatham said the budget favoured the corporate sector. He said the government would impose taxes to overcome the deficit budget, which would cause steep hike in prices of essential commodities. The Centre allocated more funds under the rural employment generation scheme. But in reality, around 10 crore people have the employment generation cards. If they are provided 100 days work then Rs 1.56 lakh crore would be needed. However, the government has allotted only Rs 48,000 crore. 
 
 Meanwhile, BJP MP K Hari Babu praised finance minister   for presenting a growth-oriented budget. “The capital gains tax exemption for the farmers in CRDA area of   who gave their lands under land pooling is a welcome step for AP.
