Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday set aside the summoning of Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini by a local court in a case of promoting enmity between different groups. The Kurukshetra court had issued bailable warrants against Saini in the case and had asked the BJP MP to appear before it.

 Justice Hari Pal Verma passed these orders while allowing a petition filed by Saini against the Kurukshetra court orders.
 
 Though the detailed orders would be released later, the HC has allowed Saini’s plea on the grounds that no sanction to prosecute him was taken from the authorities.
 
 On May 24, 2016, a judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) in Kurukshetra had issued bailable warrants against Saini after he had failed to appear before the court in connection with a complaint pending against him. The matter is pending before the Kurukshetra court in the wake of a complaint filed by city-based social activist Santosh Dahiya. 
 
 The complainant had sought directions to take action against Saini under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) of the IPC.
 
 According to the complainant, Saini had given several statements creating tension between the communities. It was also alleged that Saini wanted to put all other communities against the Jats in Haryana. Giving background of the case, the complainant had submitted that on March 4, 2014, Jat community was included under Other Backward Classes (OBC) category by the Centre. He stated since Saini’s election as an MP from Kurukshetra in April 2014, he had been running a hate campaign against the Jats opposing reservation for the community. The Jat quota was set aside by the Supreme Court in March 2015.
