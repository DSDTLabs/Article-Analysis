KOLKATA: Under pressure to get international cricket back in Pakistan, chairman of   (PCB) Najam Sethi on Monday made a strong plea for resumption of regular cricketing ties between the two countries.

 
 
 “We all saw the kind of interest generated by the India-Pakistan final in the Champions Trophy final at The Oval in London last year. It is in the interest of the game that this euphoria is sustained,” Sethi, who arrived here on Monday to attend International Cricket Council’s (ICC’s) quarterly conclave, told mediapersons.
 
 Pakistan have been starved of international cricket in their homeland after the 2009 terror attack on the Sri Lankan team bus. No international team had played in   till last year when an ICC World XI played a three-match ODI series in Lahore and earlier this month West Indies played a threematch T20 series in Karachi.
 
 The UAE continues to be Pakistan’s ‘home’ since 2009. Other Test-playing nations have preferred to play Pakistan at their adopted home in order to fulfil commitments under the ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP).
 
 Irked by BCCI’s refusal to honour a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the two Boards in 2014 to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023, the PCB has sought $70 million in compensation. An ICC panel will hear the claim in October. The   mandarins are confident that PCB’s move will not pay dividends as all bilateral tours are subject to clearance by the respective governments.
 
 The Indian government has steadfastly refused to clear any cricket series in Pakistan. The Indian team has also not played Pakistan in the UAE.
 
 Asked whether there is any realistic chance of resumption of bilateral series between the two countries in the current scenario, Sethi said: “It’s important for the two teams to start playing each other regularly. Regarding the resumption of bilateral series, I am hopeful that better sense will prevail.”
