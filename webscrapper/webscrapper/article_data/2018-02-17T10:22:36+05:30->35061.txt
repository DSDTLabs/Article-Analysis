AURANGABAD: The   bench of the   has stood first in terms of disposing of the highest number of cases during the recently concluded Lok Adalat. 

 In the latest Lok Adalat held on February 10, the subcommittee of the benchâ€™s   disposed of 464 out of 794 cases listed before it, once again leaving behind its counterparts at Mumbai and Nagpur benches, which disposed of 219 and 114 out of 423 and 495 cases listed before them respectively.
 
 Authorities with the HC here said the sub-committee headed by Justice Ravindra Borde is leading in the country in terms of highest number of cases disposed of in the past during the Lok Adalats held by different high courts in the country.
 
 When contacted, assistant government pleader Abhijit Phule said that this time too the Aurangabad bench is leading by disposing of the highest number of cases in a single day.
 
 Another AGP, Bhushan Virdhe, said that during some Lok Adalats, the HC here has been leading the chart in the country.
 
 As per an estimate, the disposal of cases by the Aurangabad bench has saved well over Rs 10 crore, which would otherwise have been spent by the exchequer during the process of trial of these cases over a period of next few years.
 
 On an average, each Justice at the HC decides over five cases per month, which means disposal of over 60 cases per Justice. Considering this average and the current strength of 13 functioning courts at Aurangabad HC, it would have taken years for disposing of 1,158 cases.
 
 The Lok Adalats are held under the National Legal Services Authority Act at the level of lower as well as high courts. The Lok Adalats are aimed at easing out the burden of cases from courts.
 
 At the level of HC, panel comprising a sitting HC justice, retired judge and a senior lawyer is formed for hearing the cases. Depending on the requirement, one or more number of panels are formed for taking a call on cases.
