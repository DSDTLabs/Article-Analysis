ROHTAK: The Class X and XII exams of   began on Tuesday with a rumour of a question paper being leaked. Officials of the Board of School Education, Haryana ( ), remained on their tenterhooks after rumours that the English subject question paper of the board’s Class XII exam was in circulation on social media. Later, it was found that the paper was fake.

 As the exam of the subject was on Tuesday itself, many outsiders gathered near examination centres with the solved key of the fake paper for supplying them to the candidates. However, large presence of police outside the examination centres foiled their bid. The board had requested for deployment of police to stop outsiders from helping students cheat in the exams.
 
 Dadri block education officer   said they had received information that the English paper was leaked and its copies were being circulated on WhatsApp and Facebook. He said information about the leaked paper was wrong and they checked its contents with the actual paper.
 
 Officials said it seemed to be a handiwork of mischievous elements who wanted to divert the attention of students to make a quick buck. BSEH chairperson Jagbir Singh said they had cancelled two examination centres at Jhajjar and at   after finding irregularities on the first day of the board exams for classes X and XII. “The said exam centres did not have proper space for seating students and there were other shortcomings as compared to the standards laid down by the board,” he said.
 
 Around 7.5 lakh students were appearing for the board examinations of Class X and XII. The exams would end on April 8. BSEH has formed 332 flying squads to keep a watch on cheating.
