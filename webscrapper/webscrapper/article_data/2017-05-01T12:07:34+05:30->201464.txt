According to a study published in journal Review of Communication, expressing gratitude is the key to a happy, and ergo, long-term success in a relationship. Plus, it's a great attribute to improve your physical and mental well-being. As the researchers put it, like we boost our immune system through vaccines periodically,   to our partners on regular basis can boost your bond too. 
 
  
  
 Before you get confused between gratitude and happiness, here’s the fine line of difference in both the emotions- the former one is generally the response of partner’s actions. For instance, if your husband gifts you a diamond ring (whoa!), you reciprocate this act of kindness by showing gratitude. “To experience gratitude, one must receive a message, and interpret the message,” shared Stephen M. Yoshimura from the US based National Communication Association. 
 
  The benefits of expressing appreciation do not stop here. The study suggests that those having this trait have reported fewer symptoms of physical illness, more exercise, and better quality of sleep. “Gratitude consistently associates with many positive social, psychological, and health states, such as an increased likelihood of helping others, optimism, exercise, and reduced reports of physical symptoms,” added Yoshimura.
  
  
 
  Several studies have also shown that expressing and experiencing gratitude hikes life satisfaction, vitality, and hope. And interestingly, this humble trait is not just having a positive impact your personal life. It can contribute to decreased levels of depression, anxiety, envy and job-related stress and burnout.
