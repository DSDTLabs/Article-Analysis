NAGPUR: More than 4,000 people protested outside the official residence of chief minister Devendra   at   on Saturday citing exploitation of the anganwadi workers by the state government. The massive protest was staged due to ‘no raise in salaries of the workers and helpers’.

 Working president of Anganwadi Workers Association Dilip Utane said, “The government had set up a committee to improve the pay scale of anganwadi workers and helpers. The committee recommended a certain rise in the salary which was to be included in the budget of the state presented in March. But the government failed to do so even after  , minister of rural development, women and child welfare, assuring in May that the salary will be increased by June.”
 
 Sources told TOI that the current pay scale of anganwadi workers is Rs5,000 and was recommended to be increased to Rs8,000. The helpers’ salary was supposedly to be increased by 75% from the current salary of Rs3,000.
 
 State general secretary of All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) Shyam Kale said, “Most of the other states give better salary to anganwadi workers and helpers, but we still follow the age-old pay scale, forcing the workers onto the edge of poverty. Even though the committee advised to increase the pay, nothing has been done yet.”
 
 Kale added that CM’s secretary has promised to arrange a meeting between their representatives and Fadnavis and they hope the meeting will bear some fruit. “If the talks fail our protest will continue across the cities,” Kale said.
