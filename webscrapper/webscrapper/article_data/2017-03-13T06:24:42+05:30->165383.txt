HYDERABAD: A 'Glaucoma Awareness Walk' meant to sensitise people on the need for screening and early detection was held in the city on Sunday morning. 

 Governor   who joined the walk organised by the L V   ( ) said, "Glaucoma is an ailment which affects all age-groups, it can impact a child or an elderly person. Sometimes it's hereditary too, so people with a family history should get regular check-ups. A gynaecologist should check for everything in a newborn and not just carry out mandatory checks. This way problems such as glaucoma can also be detected and treated early."
 
 Narasimhan also said that opthalmologists should check for pressure in the eye during each eye checkup. Dr G Chandra Sekhar, vice chair, LVPEI, said, "most patients suffering from glaucoma aren't aware that they are suffering from it and by the time it is detected it gets too late. Screening is very important."
