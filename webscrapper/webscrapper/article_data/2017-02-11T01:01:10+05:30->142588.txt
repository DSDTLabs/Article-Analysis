 Coimbatore: The civic body, along with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), will hold a ‘smart street exhibition’ where designs of the model roads finalised for the city will be displayed for people’s feedback.
 
 As many as six roads had been selected to be remodelled and redesigned to make them more pedestrian friendly. Under the project, DB Road, TV Swamy Road, Sanganoor Road, NSR Road, Masakalipalayam Road and Race Course Road would be revamped.
 
 “The corporation has sanctioned Rs5.47 crore for DB Road and T V Samy Road alone. Tenders have been floated and the project will begin in a few weeks. Before that, we wanted to get the feedback from people to ensure they also have a say in this project as they will be the end users,” said an ITDP official.
 
 The exhibition will be held on February 18 and 19 at Kalai Arangam. “The architects, who designed the roads, will display the entire project design and other details. Public can interact with them directly and give their suggestions. We will also collect written feedback and submit a report to senior corporation officials to ensure they are incorporated in the project,” said Nashwa Naushad of ITDP.
 
 The civic body has set a deadline of three months for the completion of the two streets. Field inspections by BSNL and state power utility Tangedco had been conducted last week on DB Road and TV Samy Road to check for placement of lines within ducts. Line-marking along the proposed curb and median is also being done. The roads will have elevated pedestrian crossings, wide footpaths and ducts on the drains to avoid frequent digging of the road.
 
 “Since the users are going to be the public, we want their feedback,” said a corporation official.
