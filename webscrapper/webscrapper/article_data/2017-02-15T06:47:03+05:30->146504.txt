KOLKATA: At a time when chief minister   is training guns at the Centre for holding up funds, the   has sanctioned Rs 200 crore in the first phase for constructing overbridges on national highways. To avoid railway accidents, the elevated roads will be constructed at 19 points where railway tracks have intersected the highways.

 “The Centre had written to us to identify level crossings on national highways so that they can sanction money for the construction of overbridges on all the level crossings to avoid accidents. We have identified 19 places in eight districts and wrote back to the Centre. Though the entire project cost will be about Rs 1000 crore, the Centre has allocated Rs 200 crore in the first phase. Whie the Centre will sanction funds, the state will supervise the projects and will also be responsible for acquisition of land,” a senior official at the state secretariat said.
 
 The PWD has been asked to prepare a rough budget for the project and float an open tender next week. “In some cases, the state will have to acquire land and that will have to be done within the framework of the state land acquisition rules. So we don’t want any delay and want to finish the work by 2019,” the official said.
 
 In the report sent to the Centre, the state mentioned there is requirement of four overbridges in Burdwan — one on NH-2 at Pandabeshwar, one on NH-60 at Palsit and two on NH-2B at Bhedia and Talit. Apart from that, three overbridges are required in North 24 Parganas — one on NH-34 at Barasat and Ashokenagar and two on NH-35 at Habra Gate No. 1 and 2. Jalpaiguri also needs three overbridges — all on NH-6 at Maynaguri, Lataguri and Odlabari. While Bankura, Birbhum and   need two flyovers each, Darjeeling and Cooch Behar need one each.
 
 However, the state officials are concerned about land acquisition. The state had to face severe problems during widening of national highways because of encroachment on government land.
