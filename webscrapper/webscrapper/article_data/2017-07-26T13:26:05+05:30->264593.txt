PATIALA: Situation in and around Samana town of Patiala, where a case against 14 persons was registered for disrupting a congregation being held by the followers of Dera Sacha Sauda on Sunday, remained volatile throughout Monday.

 Members of several Sikh groups gathered and held a protest demanding cancellation of the FIR.
 
 Soon after their protest, the dera followers also gathered in large numbers and demanded the arrest of those booked. Many Sikhs gathered near   in Samana while the dera followers assembled at their   near Ghagga, about 20km away.
 
 Police remained on standby to prevent a face-off between the two groups. On Sunday evening, police had registered a case under sections 295A (hurting religious feelings), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC against 14 Sikhs for disrupting the congregation.
 
 The incident had occurred in Marouri village where some Sikhs, brandishing swords, entered the naam charcha venue of the dera followers and disrupted their service.
 
 One of the accused Paramjit Singh was arrested late Sunday night and was produced before a local court, which sent him to one-day police remand. Ghagga station house officer (SHO)   said the drive to arrest the remaining accused was still on.
 
 Meanwhile, the police reinforcement, which was rushed to Mavi Kalan village on Sunday, was asked to remain stationed near Gurdwara Gahri Sahib and around the Naam Charcha Ghar at Ghagga on Monday. Policemen were asked to keep watch near mobile phone towers and water tanks to prevent any protesters from getting atop those structures.
 
 Police said there was a possibility of a protest going out of control so all strategic points were under strict surveillance. They had engaged with the leaders of the Sikh groups and the dera followers to resolve the issue.
