Two days after searching three premises connected to Rajya Sabha MP  , the Enforcement Directorate has issued summons to her for personal appearance before the investigating officer at the ED’s Delhi office on Tuesday. 

 Bharti has been asked to bring certain documents to establish her proof of income and finances in acquiring properties in Delhi, including three farm houses in posh localities. 
 
 On Saturday, ED officials had searched the three farmhouses in Ghitorni, Bijwasan and Sainik Farms in Delhi allegedly belonging to Bharti and her husband Shailesh Kumar in connection with a money laundering case registered by the agency earlier. Misha and her husband were questioned by ED officials during the search operations. 
 
 The ED is investigating Misha’s financial trail in acquiring shares of Mishail Packers and Printers Pvt Ltd, an alleged shell company that was used to acquire properties in the Capital. Misha and her husband are directors in this firm. During the searches, ED officials seized several “incriminating documents and electronic devices”. 
 
 The ED raids on Bharti’s properties came a day after the CBI conducted multiple searches on the residence and offices of Lalu and his associates in a different case pertaining to contracts awarded to a firm when he was railway minister.
