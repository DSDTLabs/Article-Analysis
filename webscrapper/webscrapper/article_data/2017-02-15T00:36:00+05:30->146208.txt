DINDIHUL: A group of lawyers, who formed an organisation called the Valarum Samuga Valakaringnar Munnani SC/ST, a forum by advocates for a social cause, staged a demonstration in front of the Dindigul collector’s office on Monday, demanding that steps be taken to free the 31 MLAs who had won by contesting in reserved constituencies in the state.

 State president of the organisation, advocate C Soundarapandi, said there were 32   with the AIADMK at present, of which only the   had extended his support to chief minister O Panneerselvam.   was claiming that she had the support of 129 MLAs, and the support of these MLAs was crucial to her in the present situation.
 
 Soundarapandi said the remaining 31 MLAs are now in Koovathur near Kalpakkam, and it is high time they come out and be among their people in their respective constituencies. He said that they were not bothered about which faction of the AIADMK these MLAs wanted to support, but that they should be allowed to do so freely and independently by consulting the people in their constituencies.
 
 Soundarapandi also said they decided to form the forum recently due to the political crisis in the state and said that time has come for them to act for the welfare of their MLAs. “These MLAs get elected, but the only minister’s portfolio that they hold is that of adidravida welfare, and not given any other recognition in the cabinet.   is a rare exception,’’ he said.
 
 Now, it is time for these MLAs to stand up for their rights in the new government whoever it is led by, to ensure that they get an important portfolio, he said.
