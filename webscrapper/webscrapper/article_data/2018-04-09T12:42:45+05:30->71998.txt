The existing number of teachers are not only facing the additional burden of academics and administrative work but even the students are suffering in academics,” said a university source.
 
 The recruitment for the faculty was last held in 2014. However, many departments were left out which are running the academic session without teachers. Many students said because of no classes they have to take private coaching. “We need more faculty as per the student-faculty ratio. To fill the gap we call retired professors or guest faculty here. However, it is still not enough and new recruitments should be done as soon as possible,” said  , head of   department.
 
 In Urdu department there are only four faculty members for PG against the total of 130 students.   (name changed), is a student of MA final in Urdu from Rajasthan University. She said, “There is no faculty in the department. In the last two years no classes for held for even a month. We have no guidance in terms of doing assignments and during exams. We don’t even know whether our assignments are properly evaluated because no one is there to guide us. There are students who score 75% despite the fact that they cannot write proper Urdu. This PG is totally pointless.”
 
 Several complaints have been given to the authorities but there has been no action on this. The university’s public relations officer,   said that the authorities are aware of faculty shortage and new faculty will be recruited very soon. Till then students are being taught by guest faculty. “We are trying our best as we too are worried about the students,” said Shekhawat.
