Navi Mumbai's police commissioner Hemant Nagrale has suspended sub-inspector Sanjay Yadav and senior inspector Ramchandra Deshmukh of the Turbhe MIDC police station in connection with an   registered by builder Suresh Jain's son Hitesh (29). 

 Hitesh had alleged that Yadav, in connivance with property investor Ketan Chug and builders Sunil Bhanushali and Sunny Lahoria, demanded Rs 5 crore for releasing his father, arrested in October 17, 2017 in a cheating and forgery case over a Nerul land deal. Hitesh called the case against his father false. "The FIR was wrongly registered as the complainant, Ketan Chug, had filed a civil suit. After three months of an appeal in the HC, he approached PSI Yadav, who turned it into a criminal offence, filed an FIR, and arrested my father," Hitesh said.
 
 After Suresh Jain's release on bail, Hitesh in December complained to the home minister, the DGP (crime) and Nagrale, who ordered an inquiry on the DGP's direction. "Yadav and Deshmukh were handed suspension orders on Tuesday evening after a preliminary inquiry conducted by ACP (crime) Nilesh Raut," said DCP (crime) Dilip Doshi. "Now will come a departmental inquiry."
 
 Deshmukh told TOI his suspension order states that he didn't go through the case properly and did not properly guide the investigating officer (Yadav). "It also says that I did not give my suggestions in the case. In fact, I had refused to register an FIR against builder Suresh Jain as it was a civil matter, but Yadav insisted on registering an FIR and took the case file to DCP (Zone-1), who ordered the FIR to be registered."
 
 Deshmukh said, "Yadav arrested Jain without taking my permission. But, being in charge of the police station, I was held responsible. If I was investigating the case, I should have been blamed. But I was not probing the case. Hence, I will wait for justice."
