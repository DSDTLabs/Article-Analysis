PUNE:   on Tuesday called the Shiv Sena a   to the BJP that could not afford to sever ties with it.

 “The Shiv Sena is not even a state-level party. In Vidarbha, the party doesn't have any hold and no candidate to contest its elections. It is the same in western Maharashtra and in other parts of the state. The BJP is a national party. Some Sena leaders may spit fire now but they cannot afford to cut ties with the BJP,“ Bapat told the TOI.
 
 Bapat's statements come a day after   said the BJP was not fulfilling its promise of waiving off loans to farmers despite being in power in the state.
 
 Thackerey, on Sunday , had also threatened to withdraw support to the state government and had spoken about a possible mid-term polls in Maharashtra. He had also said earlier that the state government was on `notice period.' “In the state assembly, our party has got a majority of the seats. The independents support us. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress are in no way capable of forming a government in the state. There are leaders in the Shiv Sena who want to create panic and an unstable atmosphere in the state. The same goes for many party higher-ups too.One has to accept that there are problems between the BJP and the Shiv Sena but these are related to principles and not individuals,“ Bapat said.
 
 Another BJP leader from Pune said matters will ease out between the two parties after the civic polls.
 
 “Once this election is over, all will be fine between the two parties. There is no chance of a break in the alliance. Civic polls are fought on local issues,“ the leader said, requesting anonymity . Bapat added that the party's stand on highlighting local issues rather than national ones will remain in focus. “We will concentrate on development of the city . Voters are more concerned about their area and the city ,“ he said.
