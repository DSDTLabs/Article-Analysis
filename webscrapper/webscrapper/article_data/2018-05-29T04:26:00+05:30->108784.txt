Vadodara: Dahod district has thrown up a dismal result in the standard 10 Gujarat board exam results. Only 37.35 per cent of students from the district cleared the exams in the results declared on Monday.

 Dahod has been under the scanner since 2017 when a paper leak case had come to light during the exams there. More eyebrows were raised after results of several students in the district were cancelled due to discrepancies in marks of their objective and subjective papers. These students could not give answers to some basic questions when asked by the board. The districted had clocked a pass percentage of 76.39 per cent last year.
 
 The district had come under a scanner during the standard 10 exams this year after reports of a question paper being leaked at a school and an offence being registered on the very first day of the exams. The system went on an overdrive after this to ensure no irregularities took place this year.
 
 The Mahisagar district that got the second lowest result this year got 48.85 per cent pass percentage. This district too had got a result of 74.58 per cent last year and was the place where the paper leak had come to light last year. This year too identical essays were written by examinees here and mass copying had come to light.
 
 Dahod district also got the dubious distinction of having the centre with the lowest result in the state this year. Only 5.93 per cent students from the Sukhsar exam centre passed in the exams. No school in the district got a cent per cent result while only seven schools got a result between 91 per cent to 99 per cent.
