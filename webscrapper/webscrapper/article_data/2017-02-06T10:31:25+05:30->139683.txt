PATNA: Apart from enjoying perfect weather and various cultural programmes, Patnaites can also tickle their taste buds at the 10-day   which will begin at   from February 15.

 The festival, organised jointly by the   and art, culture and youth affairs department, would have mouthwatering dishes from different parts of India, such as Rajasthan, Punjab, West Bengal and southern states. There would also be Chinese and continental food for the foodies.
 
 Patna divisional commissioner   said Basant Utsav is being organised in the city for the second time. “Food stalls were put up last year too. However, this time people manning the food counters of different states will welcome the guests in their own languages,” Kishor said, adding that visitors would have to pay an entry fee of Rs 10.
 
 Asked about cultural programmes, the divisional commissioner said there would be ‘qawwali’, comedy and ‘ghazal’ programmes, apart from performances on Bollywood numbers. “Last year, Sabri brothers sang ‘qawwalis’ and   entertained the visitors with his comedies. Several eminent artists, including those from Bihar, would perform this year too,” Kishor said, adding that final selection of the artists would be done in a couple of days.
 
 Authorities of various schools and colleges have been requested to encourage the students to participate in various competitions, such as painting, quiz, singing and dancing. The winners would be awarded. Kishor said the motive behind organising Basant Utsav was to give Patnaites an opportunity to enjoy the spring.
