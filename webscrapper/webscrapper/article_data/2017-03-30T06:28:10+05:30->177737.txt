AHMEDABAD: In February this year the AMC-Medical   issued a circular in which it said that it could transfer any   between medical college and AMC-run hospitals in the city. 

 The transferred professor or employee has to serve for three years before seeking a transfer or a promotion. The AMC-MET has also mentioned that if a professor has been transferred after being promoted and if the professor wishes to come back to his original location after sometime, then AMC-MET will have the authority to demote him and cancel his salary raise.
 
 The circular has already caused flutter in the medical establishment. “Many senior medical officials in the AMC-run hospitals are serving for more than a decade. How come the circular does not apply to them. Only professors or employees at lower posts in the medical fraternity will be harassed ,” says a senior trustee of the  . 
 
 The circular also claims that if a professor has served three years at the transferred location then a special committee will assess his or her performance before transferring the professor again. “We are planning to give a representation to the AMC-MET again to withdraw the circular,” says a senior professor at VS Hospital.
