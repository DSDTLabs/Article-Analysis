CHANDIGARH: A small roundabout next to the dispensary in Sector 22 is the latest to be hit with civic apathy. It lies covered in garbage, like an eyesore at the crossroads of a prominent shopping locale of the city.

 The roundabout is surrounded by two sections of the Sector 22 market on one side and a residential street on the other. A huge playground is also close by. “I don’t know where all this filth came from but this sure looks very bad. Roundabouts are an important beautification feature of this city. How can these be left dirty,” said M K  , a passerby.
 
 The heaps of garbage accumulated the edges of the   plastic waste, rotten leaves, dead grass, and mud that appeared to have been swiped off the road and thrown carelessly on to the roundabout. “The road is cleaned every morning by the sanitation workers, who also pick up the filth and deposit it into a nearby dumpster, outside the residential-area park. We can't say who could dump garbage at the roundabout. Could be some careless residents,” said  , a nearby shopkeeper.
 
 A lot of people have reported the overnight dumping of garbage at odd locations and demanded a solution.
