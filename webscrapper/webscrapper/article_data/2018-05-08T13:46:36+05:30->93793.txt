As residents kept hoping for rain to get rid of the heat, weathermen in Ranchi predicted otherwise. Though it did not issue any heat wave alert, the Ranchi office of India Meteorological Department predicted largely clear skies with less chance of showers. 

 The  's national weather portal predicted the possibility of a dust-storm in Ranchi and areas nearby on Wednesday. "Districts in northeast and northwest Jharkhand may receive rainfall at isolated places with gusty winds blowing at 40 kilometers an hour on Tuesday. The chances of rainfall till May 11 are nil," the weather office said in a statement. 
 
 A weatherman said there was no synoptic situation over Jharkhand and its adjoining areas which could result in a wet spell. "There is a cyclonic circulation over sub-Himalayan West Bengal. But that is unlikely to have any effect on Jharkhand's weather," the expert said. The weather office also predicted that mercury levels in Garhwa, Chatra, Palamu and   will hover around 45-degree Celsius till Friday. Doctors in Ranchi advised people to venture out of their homes with covered faces to avoid heat-stroke. "Everyone must drink sufficient water, avoid spicy and oily food to keep themselves healthy," J K Mitra, head of medicine department at Rims, said.
