"MNM is a democratic party. I will have to discuss with others to decide what we can do for this cause as a party," he said. 
 
 He also won people's hearts when he stopped his convoy to help an accident victim. As he was leaving Colachel, Kamal saw a woman injured in an accident. He immediately stopped his vehicle and rushed to her help. He sent her to the hospital in one of the vehicles in his convoy. 
 
 During one of his public meetings he said, "As an actor I know the art of attracting the crowd. But I have not come here as a celebrity to show my strength, or seeking votes. I have come here to listen and understand your needs and to work out the best solutions for your long pending issues," he said. "Being human is more important that being smart. This is an educational tour for me to come to understand you," he said.
