PATNA: The situation with regard to the withdrawal of cash in the second pay week after   of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes is comparatively smoother in most urban areas of the state. Though banks in some   faced some difficulties in disbursing cash on Tuesday, the situation was not as alarming as it was in the first salary week.

 The situation was normal in Patna and no long queue was seen at any bank or ATM kiosk. “I was a bit apprehensive while going to the ATM in the morning because I was not sure whether I will get cash or not. It was a pleasant surprise that the two ATMs I visited to withdraw money for different accounts had cash and dispensed Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes. In December, most ATMs only had Rs 2,000 notes,” said   resident Ajit Chaudhary.
 
 According to sources, the   has asked the   (RBI) for more cash to disburse it among the pensioners and the salaried class people.
 
 State Level Bankers’ Committee members on Tuesday claimed that the situation had improved considerably compared to last month. “We have not received any complaint from any bank in the urban areas with regard to the shortage of cash as the number of customers at most branches has reduced sharply,” committee assistant general manager R K Das told TOI.
 
 RBI officials in Patna pointed out that they were providing sufficient remittances to most banks considering the rush during pay week. “Different banks had approached us for increased remittances in light of payment of salaries by government and private institutions to their employees. The RBI is in a position to meet the demand of increased cash remittance and we are providing the required amount of cash to the banks regularly,” a senior RBI official said.
