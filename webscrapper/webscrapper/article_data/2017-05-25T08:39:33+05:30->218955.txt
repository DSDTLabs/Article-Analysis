MADURAI: The   of the Madras high court on Wednesday stayed all proceedings relating to the National Eligibility cum Entrance test ( ) till June 7. The results are scheduled to be released on June 8.

  Unless the interim stay is vacated in the coming days, release of key answers, evaluation of papers and declaration of results will not be possible as scheduled.
  
  In a joint writ petition, a group of students from Madurai sought cancellation of NEET as the question papers had not been fair and set at different levels in different states. 
  
  They had stated that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had set the question papers in 10 different languages, including Tamil, and that some states had a lenient paper compared to other states.
  
  The petitioners -- S Jonila, P Surya, P Siddharth, K Ajay Sharan, S Nitin Prakash Sivasubramanian, Gauthaman Shankar, J Aditya, D   and M   -- had stated that all of them wrote the examination in English on May 7 on the basis of a uniform syllabus. 
  
  The petitioners said they had been shocked to learn that the question paper had not been uniform for all the states. They had come to know that the question paper in Tamil had been easier than the English question paper. They wanted the examination to be cancelled and conducted in a uniform manner again.
  
  On Wednesday, a similar petition filed by T Sakthi Malarkodi of Trichy came up for hearing before Justice M V Muralidharan, who stayed all proceedings relating to NEET till June 7 and ordered notices to the respondents including the Union health and family welfare secretary, director of general health services, New Delhi, Medical Council of India, New Delhi, CBSE, New Delhi,   health and family welfare secretary to file their counters on June 7.
