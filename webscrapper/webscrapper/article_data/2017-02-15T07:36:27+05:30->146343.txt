AHMEDABAD: The   on Tuesday suggested that the state government conduct a ground-level survey to assess the magnitude of illegal limestone mining in Porbandar district and commented that Google Earth images may not be sufficient to gauge the quantum of mineral theft. A bench of Justice A S Dave and Justice A Y Kogje made this observation in response to a PIL alleging a big mineral theft scam, in which Porbandar district collector has ordered associates and the kin of water resources minister   to pay over Rs 150 crore for illegal mining.

 B M Mangukiya, the advocate of the petitioner,  , had placed 31 Google images to highlight the scale on which illegal mining has taken place in an area of 20 sq km. The state government also agreed to an extent with these claims and submitted before the court that satellite images had corroborated them. To this submission, the HC insisted on a ground-level survey. The court also granted time till February 21 to the petitioner to file a counter-affidavit. The petitioner said that though the government has assessed illegal mining at Rs 252 crore, the scam could be pegged at over Rs 10,000 crore.
 
 The petitioner alleged that the data of illegal mining activity allegedly carried out by Bokhiria and his associates are not even tip of iceberg. He has submitted that the orders passed by district collector in connection with illegal activities cover merely a part of the large scam.
