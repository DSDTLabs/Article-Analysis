Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will be earning an additional revenue of Rs43 lakh every year thanks to Ugat Botanical Garden in the city, which has been developed on the lines of the Kankaria Lake in Ahmedabad. 

 Ugat Botanical Garden on Bhesan Road has been developed by SMC on 1.38 lakh square metre land of which 45,000 square metre has been taken up by the lake alone. Khodal Corporation, the civic body’s private partner from Ahmedabad, has been given 10,000 square metre of land to install 19 rides and set up a restaurant and other facilities. Khodal Corporation has made an investment of Rs19.3 crore on a toy train, helium balloon and rides like Columbus, Octopus, Crazy Jump, Injector, Rocket Space, Free Fall Tower, etc. 
 
 “Trials of the rides were carried out recently. The inauguration date will be finalized soon,” said Rajesh Jariwala, executive engineer of the housing department at SMC. 
 
 “We are following a revenue sharing model for this project. SMC will get 7.5% to 12% profit from this project which is expected to generate revenue in several crores. The minimum guarantee money taken from the partner is Rs21.56 lakh,” said Jariwala. This deal is for a period of 45 years. SMC will get 15% rise every three years.
 
 Families in the city have been longing for a weekend getaway. More than 5,000 people visit Gopi Talav during the weekends. SMC had redeveloped the lake a couple of years ago.
