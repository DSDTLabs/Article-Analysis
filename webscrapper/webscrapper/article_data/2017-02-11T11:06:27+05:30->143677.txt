JAIPUR: Soon,   is likely to get another tiger.   (NTCA) has given permission for the shifting of a male tiger to Sariska and state Wildlife and Forest department is awaiting central ministry’s nod, said sources privy to the development. 

 R S Shekawat, field director at   Reserve, confirming the development said, National Tiger Conservation Authority has given permission for shifting a tiger to the reserve. However, officials said it is yet to be decided from where the tiger would be shifted.
 
 Sources said wildlife department is trying to translocate a tiger from outside the state to diversify the gene pool in Sariska. Official said the relocation likley to takes place after March this year. 
 
 Last year, Wildlife   (WII) had shot down the proposal of state wildlife department for shifting a sub-adult from   on the ground that genetic configuration of tiger should be given priority for future translocation instead of conflict mitigation. As Sariska tigers are shifted from Ranthmabore and after tigers vanished from Sariska in 2005, both tigers share the same gene pool. 
 
 Sources said, “It depends on other states agreeing to part with the tiger. If they are not ready to part with tiger, then state wildlife department has no option but to shift one from the Ranthambore National Park.”
 
 According to WII, as per population viability analysis carried out based on the present population of tigers in Sariska, it is necessary to supplement one adult male and adult female tigers every three to five years for next 15 to 20 years to rule out possibility of extinction of tiger population.
 
 Presently, there are 14 tigers in Sariska Tiger Reserve of which four are male and nine females and one tiger cub ST-15 (below one year) whose sex has not been determined yet.
