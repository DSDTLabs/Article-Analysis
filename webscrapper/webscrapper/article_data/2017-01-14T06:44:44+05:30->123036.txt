KOLKATA: Two skeletons were discovered by KMC conservancy workers from a vat in the   area in   on Friday morning. 

 Behala police have sent the skeletal remains for forensic testing and CID has started inquiries into the incident. 
 
 The site is less than 3km from  , which was in the news for being involved in the child trafficking racket. The case took a whole new dimension when the mother of a missing girl — who had worked at the Behala and Hanspukur (Thakurpukur) trafficking dens and had gone missing — asking for a DNA test to ascertain if the bones were her daughter’s.
 
 According to witnesses, it was around 8.50am when workers cleaning the vat noticed the skeletons, one of them intact, in a plastic bag. 
 
 “I was out in the morning when local youths gathered near the vat told me about the skeletons. There were several bones and some of them were reduced to dust. The skeletons looked old. We are not sure if someone dumped them directly in the vat or had used a conservancy vehicle to dump it. A few bones were even tied to one another,” said  , a local.
 
 DC (Behala) Meeraz Khalid said, “Parts of two skulls and some bones were found in a plastic packet in a garbage bin on Raja Rammohan Roy Road. The bones appear to be part of skeletons used by doctors for demonstration.”
