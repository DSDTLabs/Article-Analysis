KOLKATA: A day after   was found dead in her flat, her mother   has claimed that a 43-year-old “married man”, who claimed to be  , has abetted the suicide. The possibility of a murder cannot be ruled out either, she has argued. 

 Based on the mother’s complaint, Garfa police has registered a case of abetment to suicide.
 
  “We are waiting for the postmortem report to ascertain if there was any foul play. If required, we will add relevant sections,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.
 
 “A case has been registered at Garfa police station under IPC section 306 against one Saikat Mitra. This is based on the complaint filed by her mother Gita Rani Saha. Further investigation is on,” said DC (SSD) Badana Varun Chandra Sekhar. Sources said they might ask Mitra to help in the investigation since he had even met Gita last Saturday. “The fact that she had her wrist slashed has made the family apprehensive,” said a source.
 
 Saha stayed alone in the flat after she moved out of her mother’s house, which was about 10 minutes away, reportedly following some “strains” over her new relationship with this man. The two though kept in touch. The body was found when her mother went to visit her on Tuesday. On not receiving any response from her daughter, she alerted the neighbours, who called the police.
 
 “We found the flat locked from outside. On entering, we found her body hanging from the fan. There were cuts on her left wrist. It looks like a suicide but we are exploring all angles,“ said a senior officer at the Garfa police station. The neighbours told cops that they had noticed newspapers piling up at Saha’s door over the past two days, hinting she had not stepped out.
 
 Earlier a model, Saha did bit roles in serials and films. Her co-workers said she had been depressed for a while.
