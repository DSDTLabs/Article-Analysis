VIJAYAWADA: A woman and her three-year-old daughter drowned after two boats collided in Krishna river on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. The deceased were identified as   (26) and   (3), natives of Ibrahimpatnam in Krishna district. Madhavi's husband Saidaraju survived the incident as he managed to swim to the river bank. 

 
 Saidaraju with his family had ventured into the river to catch fish on Friday evening. After placing nets, the family stayed back in the boat and fell asleep. At the same time, Mudraboina Naga Malleswara Rao, along with one Pavan, sailed a dredger boat for sand mining. Malleswara Rao, who was steering the boat, rammed into Saidaraju's vessel. As the boat capsized,   and Kavya drowned. Saidaraju was unable to find his wife and daughter in the dark.
 
 Thullur inspector   said, "We do not have specific information as to when the incident took place. We received a call at about 5.45am . We rushed to the spot by 6am. The local fishermen were searching for the mother and daughter. We have called in State Disaster Response Force (SDRF)."After about four hours SDRF swimmers fished out the bodies. The search operation was difficult as the river bed has deep pits because of unplanned sand mining.
 
 Sand mining is not allowed after sunset and before sunrise. It was also learned that the boats do not have licences to operate on the river.
 
 Thullur mandal revenue officer M Purnachandar Rao told STOI that they do not have information about the licences of the boats as it does not come under their purview. "We have formed a mandal-level committee to review the operations of passenger boats but do not have instructions for sand dredgers" he said.
