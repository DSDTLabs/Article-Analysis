JAMSHEDPUR: Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) has taken steps to ensure that   here do not face any problem in   this summer. 

 The sanctuary officials are trying to remove trash from the water to make it worth drinking. Desilting and cleaning of the artificial water holes has already begun. It is expected that the cleaning work of at least 30 water holes, out of 70 will be finished by mid-May.
 
 Sanctuary officials have also said they may transport water from the foothills if the need arises, following the cleaning work. "We will carry out desilting as per requirement. Then the quantum of water to be ferried through mobile tankers will be decided," said forest ranger, R P Singh.
 
 Majority of the water holes have adequate water but some amount usually starts evaporating when the temperature starts increasing, he added. Hence, sanctuary officials have been instructed to monitor the water holes located at different points across the sanctuary, which sprawls over an area of 193sqkm.
 
 Singh also said natural water bodies for large animals, particularly wild elephants, are in good condition. There won't be any scarcity of water for the herds that will stay at the sanctuary till monsoon arrives. 
 
 The official said, "Since herds occupy the natural water bodies, rest of the wild animals depend on artificial holes to quench their thirst. That is why the construction of the man-made holes have increased over the years." 
 
 A forest official in the Dhalbhum division said, "Incidents of elephants descending to the foothills in search of water and attacking villagers on the way, shouldn't occur this year as the department is taking adequate measures in this regard."
