MARGAO: Curtorim Congress MLA Aleixo  , on Monday, severely criticised the frequent rise in petrol, diesel and   cylinder prices.

 “The Manohar Parrikar-led   government has cheated ‘goemkars’ by frequently hiking petrol and domestic gas prices. The continuous rise in the prices of petrol and LPG from March 2012 to the present is another act of treachery by the Manohar Parrikar-led BJP government, after getting petrol prices slashed by Rs 11 in the so-called March 2012 populist budget which brought down the price of   to Rs 54 per litre from the then current price of Rs 65 per litre. After a short phase of it’s reduction by Rs 11 per litre, the price of petrol in the state today is at an all-time high of Rs 68.96 per litre. This clearly indicates  , the expert in bluffing ‘goemkars’ with U-turn policies, has reneged on his promise of locking the price of gas and petrol,” Lourenco told reporters,
 
 “More importantly, the price of domestic gas is fluctuating between Rs 704 to Rs 655 for a 14.2 kg gas cylinder. In May 2013, the price of domestic gas was Rs 418 for a 14.2 kg gas cylinder,” he added.
