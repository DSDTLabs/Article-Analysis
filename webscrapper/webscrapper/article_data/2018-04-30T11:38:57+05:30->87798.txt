Do you remember   and  ? Yes, the protagonists from 2017 hit ‘Bisorjon’. Now, both the actors are ready to bring back their magical chemistry on the celluloid with the sequel of the film titled ‘Bijaya’, directed by  .

 ‘Bisorjon’ earned rave reviews after release and even won the national award last year. So will the sequel hold the same cast? Well,   finally announced last week that he is ready to start working on the sequel and will have the original star cast intact. This means Abir Chatterjee,  , and Ganguly will reprise their roles in ‘Bijaya’.
 
 The whole team of ‘Bisorjon’ is quite excited about the sequel. Abir and Jaya are also equally happy to reprise their characters once again. When we spoke to Jaya Ahsan, she seemed very excited and tensed at the same time. She said, “I am so happy that the sequel is finally happening. 'Bisorjon' is so close to my heart. But I am a bit tensed also. The way audience loved my character Padma, I don’t know if I can do justice to the character again. So, I will leave all these on Kaushik Da. I know he will sort it out.” (chuckles with an innocent face)
 
 Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi actress has just wrapped up the shooting of ‘Crisscross’. Jaya plays an uptight businesswoman in this film directed by Birsa Dasgupta. “It was a great experience working with Birsa Dasgupta. We even formed our own girl gang on the sets. It was so much fun. I am playing the character of a businesswoman who is successful in her professional life but somewhat lonely in her personal life.", Jaya added.
 
 The actress is currently busy with her first home production ‘Debi’. The recently released teaser from the film has already done well on social media. It has crossed one million views within a week. While speaking about the same Jaya said, “It’s really a great feeling. The teaser has reached a landmark. Everybody is talking about it. It’s just beyond expectation. I hope ‘Debi’ scores well at the box-office.”
