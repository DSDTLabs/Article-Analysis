PATNA: With the polling for the Bihar legislative council election due on March 9, the RJD on Monday made last-minute preparations to ensure the win of grand alliance candidates from all the four constituencies going to the polls. 

 RJD’s state vice-president and party’s in-charge for the council polls Tanvir Hasan on Monday held a series of meetings at the party HQ and took stock of the council polls from different districts. Hasan also called up the party’s district presidents, block presidents, MLAs and MLCs of the districts concerned and gave them necessary directions.
 
 Though the elections are being held in four constituencies -- Gaya Graduates, Gaya Teachers, Saran Graduates and Kosi Teachers, the RJD has fielded candidates only from the   and Gaya Teachers constituencies. Its alliance partner, JD (U), is contesting from the remaining two constituencies.
 
 RJD’s Punit Kumar Singh, son of former minister Jagadanand, and Dinesh Prasad Yadav and JD (U)’s Virendra Narayan Yadav and Sanjiv Kumar Singh are the grand alliance’s official candidates from Gaya Graduates, Gaya Teachers, Saran Graduates and Kosi Teachers constituencies, respectively. The alliance’s third partner, Congress, has also fielded candidates from Gaya Graduates and Gaya Teachers constituencies.
 
 BJP’s Awadesh Narain Singh, RLSP’s Sanjiv Shyam Singh, HAM (S)’s   and BJP’s Jagdish Chandra are the official NDA candidates from Gaya Graduates, Gaya Teachers, Saran Graduates and Kosi Teachers constituencies, respectively.
 
 One of the key constituencies is Gaya Graduates where council chairman and BJP nominee Awadesh Narain Singh is locked in a triangular contest with RJD’s Punit and Congress’ Ajay Kumar Singh.
