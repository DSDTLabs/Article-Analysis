PANAJI: As temperatures rise in the city,  , the king of fruits, has hit the local markets providing relief to locals.

 “People are going for mangoes at first sight but hesitate on knowing the rates. They then settle for other fruits. So for now, the sale of other fruits is steady. Once mangoes flood the marker, and the rates start dropping, shoppers will be ignore other fruits right away,” said  , a fruit-seller at the   market.
 
 While mangoes are still elusive to the shoppers due to the high prices, fruit vendors at the market are keeping their fingers crossed. “Up until a few weeks ago mangoes were selling for Rs 300-400 per mango. Now it’s reduced to Rs 1,000 per dozen. People are eager to purchase mangoes, especially the Mancurad variety, as it’s a local favourite,” said another fruit vendor, Tabrez Mokashi.
 
 Based on the quality and size, the price varies from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 for a dozen Mancurad mangoes, while the price of   variety varies from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000. For now, only these two varieties are available in the market.
 
 “Rates will remain this way for another ten days before they come spiralling down,” said vendor  .
 
 Buyers are keeping a watch on the supply and are currently avoiding mango purchases. “Mangoes are very expensive right now. We will wait for another 15 days to purchase them. Besides, I suspect that they are chemically ripened so I don’t want to risk eating such a fruit,” said   resident, A D’Souza.
 
 Aparna Khadeparkar from   said, “The quality of mangoes in the market in April is far better compared to what they could be now. By mid-April, I will buy those that are naturally ripened and at reasonable rates.”
