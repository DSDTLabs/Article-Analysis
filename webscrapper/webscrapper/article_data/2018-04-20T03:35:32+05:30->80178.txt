 Acting on a tipoff, the Palghar police raided a mobile phone shop in Nalasopara (east). The two accused were changing the IMEI numbers of stolen cellphones by using software. Seven handsets recovered from the accused have turned out to be stolen. The police said they are ascertaining if the handsets were used for committing any major crime.

The duo has also been booked under the IPC's sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention), and under the Indian Telegraph Act and IT Act.
