The first thing that strikes our mind when we think of   is his peppy folk numbers. The singer, who is dubbed as Folk  , has become synonymous with the genre. But now, he has sung a melody for  , the composer of Aval.
Says Girishh, “The song is for an upcoming film, Pakshi, which is directed by Jagadeesan Subu, who is also making Sigai. The film is a road movie involving a female photographer, played by  , and in one portion, we have a song that is sung by a shepherd. This is a melody on the lines of Munpaniya and Poonkaatrile. I liked the way Anthony Daasan had sung the song Othaiyila in Iraivi, and decided to ask him to sing this one.”
 “Why me?” That was the first thing that Anthony Daasan asked him, reveals Girishh. “But once I told him about liking Othaiyila, he agreed. He was very cooperative during the recording,” he says.
 The song has been written by  , who has previously written the lyrics in   and Sigai. “The song, titled Naadodiye, is about self-realisation, so the lines are philosophical (like in the Kannadasan numbers of yore), reflecting on life. The lines are in classical Tamil, so Anthony Daasan singing them also will make the song quite different,” promises the composer.
