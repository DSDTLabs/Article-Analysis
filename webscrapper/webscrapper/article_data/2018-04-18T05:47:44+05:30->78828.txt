AGRA: Two  , 19 and 13, were found murdered in a field, just 500 metres from their home, in Uttar Pradesh’s Etawah district on Tuesday. Both the bodies had multiple gunshot wounds. According to police sources, a local boy who had been stalking the elder sister for some time is the prime suspect. No arrest has been made in the case so far.
 
  The girl’s father, a farmer, said the siblings had left the house on Monday evening but didn’t come back. “We thought they had gone to attend a wedding in the neighbourhood. We were shocked to know about their murder on Tuesday morning. We don’t have enmity with anybody. I don’t understand why anybody would kill my daughters.”
 
 On Tuesday morning, villagers in Kelamau spotted their bodies in the field and informed the family.
  
  Talking to TOI, Etawah senior superintendent of police   said that the post-mortem report has revealed that the girls were not sexually assaulted. However, he said a case has been registered under IPC section 302 (murder) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, against unknown suspects keeping the stalking angle in mind.
  
  “We are investigating the double murder from all angles and a forensic team is working at the site. The case will be cracked soon,” the SSP said.
  
  Etawah legislator   has assured the family an impartial investigation and said the accused will be arrested soon. “It’s a serious matter. I am with the family in their fight for justice. The accused will be punished,” she said.
  
  In September last year, bodies of two girls, 17 and 18, who had gone to school but never returned were found in a canal in Etawah a few days later. It turned out that the girls were kidnapped, raped and murdered.
