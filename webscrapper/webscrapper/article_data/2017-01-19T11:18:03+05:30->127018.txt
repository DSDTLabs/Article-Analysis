NASHIK: A day after   announced that there would not be any  , the party workers are all charged up for the  . 

 “Our leaders are of the view that the party has failed to grow despite its cadres working hard as there was an   with the Sena prior to 2012 civic polls. Shiv Sena walked away with the lion’s share of seats. Now, with our party at power in Centre and state, it is better to contest the polls without any alliance,” said  , Madhyapashchhim Mandal president of BJP.
 
 Sena activists and aspirants also do not have any regrets about the break-up. “The alliance was already broken during the last NMC election. So it was clear that we would go alone this time too. We feel sorry for the BJP which is now going against its own leaders like Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde, who along Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray dreamt of strong nation on Hindutva,” said Praveen Tidme, Shiv Sena office-bearer for Nashik West assembly constituency. Sena leaders said the BJP does not have any strong base in CIDCO areas. “We are happy that most of our functionaries active since last decade might get chance to contest elections as there would be no alliance,” Kiran Shinde, another Sena functionary said.
 
 BJP functionary Girish Bhadane said the move will ensure the party makes inroads deeper in the society. “We are confident that in this civic election, the city voters shall vote for the BJP. Developmental issues will be our main plank,” he said.
