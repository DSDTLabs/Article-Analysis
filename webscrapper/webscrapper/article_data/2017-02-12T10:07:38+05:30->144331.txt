KOLHAPUR: Over 25 women from Vashi village have appealed to electors not to choose candidates distributing liquor to woo voters in the zilla parishad (ZP) and  .

 Women from the village, located 4km from the city, have formed a ‘De-addiction Association’ to fight the menace of alcohol. The association’s members went from school to school in the nearby villages and conducted an essay-writing and drawing competition on the theme of de-addiction.
 
 Sindhutai Chavan the association convenor said, “As the election nears, candidates start distributing money or alcohol to woo voters. Nowadays, coupons are distributed for the alcoholic to get liquor. We are spreading our message to each household in the village through our contests. We are also trying to get more women to support our movement against liquor consumption.”
 
 The association will announce the competition results next week and will also arrange a rally in the village, where Chavan expects over 250 women to participate. The association has also appealed to people not to vote for those candidates who consume alcohol. The voting for ZP elections takes place on February 21 and the results are announced two days later.
 
 “The election period is a good time to spread the message and this is for the first time that such appeal has been made by any association in the district. Women are now acting against alcohol consumption and they are the ones to take the message to each family. We are also extending the anti-liquor campaign during the annual village fairs. Liquor consumption is the highest during annual fairs. We will shame any person found in public consuming liquor by carrying out a rally,” Chavan said.
