When was the last time you wrote an essay? While others have to jog their memory to search for answer, Nashikites have a quick reply. In the morning, on way to work/college/errands! Why would someone write an essay in the busiest hours of the day? Because it was an exam they had to appear for not wearing   while driving two-wheeler.

We went to colleges and other workplaces, organised awareness sessions, we even tripled the fine and made people pay fine of Rs 500 if they are caught driving without helmet. But yet people are reluctant to wear helmet. Making them write benefits of helmet was the only way to make them introspect. Now if the same people who wrote essays are caught not wearing helmet we will be showing them the essay they wrote,” shares SB Kale, police inspector and one of the supervising officers of the  . 
 
  Mumbai Naka turned out to be an exam hall for people who were caught driving without helmet. Nashikites, who left for their daily routine in the morning, had no clue that police wear waiting for them with pens, answer sheets and benches. “We had prepared everything. Got benches from schools and provided pen and paper to the people,” says Anand Wagh, another police inspector supervising the drive. 
 
  
 Journalists, government officers, lawyers and even police no one was spared from writing this essay. “I have made senior government officers and even my 11 constables write this essay. The message is clear, if you are driving without helmet, there is no excuse.
