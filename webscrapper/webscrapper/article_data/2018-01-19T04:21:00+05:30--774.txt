Vadodara: A team of detection of crime branch (DCB) visited Jalgaon in Maharashtra to probe the series of ATM thefts that happened in the city during Uttarayan. 

 The investigators suspect that the burglars are from Jalgaon as the vehicle they used to was registered in Jalgaon. The team met Jalgaon police and tried to gather information about the gangs there. 
 
 “The vehicle used in the ATM thefts is registered in Jalgaon. Also, similar ATM thefts were registered before Uttarayan there. Our team visited Maharashtra to gather more details about the thefts there and get clues about the gang that may have roots in Jalgaon,” said Dharamraj Chudasama, police inspector, detection of crime branch said. The cops are yet to get much clues about the gang or its whereabouts.
 
 A gang of five thieves had used gas cutters to break the ATMs of the government-run and private banks in Tarsali, Manjalpur, Ajwa Road, Makarpura and near Vadsar bridge on Sunday night. They broke open six ATMs in the city’s peripheral areas within few hours and stole Rs 14.94 lakh cash from five. CCTV grabs of the areas where the thefts happened had revealed the vehicle they used for the crime. 
 
 The thieves also seem to have deliberately targeted the ATMs in areas on the periphery so that they can escape easily. It is suspected that they fled from the national highway 8 which is directly connected to the approach roads to the city. The gang took advantage of the fact that most of the police force was deployed in the old city areas to ensure security during Uttarayan.
