Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Thursday gave city   one last chance to file a reply in the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) case.

 A bench comprising justice Bhushan Gavai and Indira Jain orally told the respondents, the state government and city police, that the court will transfer the case to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) if they don’t file a reply within a week.
 
 The VCA had moved court after two complaints were registered against its office bearers under Sections 188 and 336 of IPC and 131A and 135 of Bombay Police Act. The second complaint was lodged by Jamtha Gram Panchayat deputy sarpanch for alleged noise pollution. The controversy had broken out allegedly over VCA’s refusal to provide 500 free passes to police.
 
 In the last hearing on February 9 too, the bench had sternly asked commissioner of police K Venkatesh to take the issue very seriously and intervene. However, the state and all the DCPs failed to file a reply.
 
 The next hearing has been scheduled for February 23. 
 
 Senior counsel Sunil Manohar, advocate Rajendra Daga and advocate Akshay Naik appeared for the petitioners while government pleader Bharti Dangre represented the state.
 
 Daga said, “In case the cops fail to file reply even by next week, then the court may proceed ex-parte.”
 
 On February 10, the VCA had submitted all documents, such as the occupancy certificate as demanded by the police. It had also filed an affidavit mentioning the submission.
 
 The VCA had cited a letter from Hingna PI Moreshwar Barapatre on February 2, seeking total description of ticket sales through online portal bookmyshow.com and entire footage of T20 international played between India and England on January 29.
 
 The letter also demanded all documents and no objection certificates (NOCs) regarding Jamtha stadium’s construction.
