Ludhiana: The aim to increase 15%   of the city in five years is going to be a tough task for the municipal corporation.

 Though MC was supposed to do the same under Atal Mission Rejuvenation and Urban Transmission (AMRUT) scheme, not even single sapling has been planted in the past two-and-a-half years.
 
 However, the MC is now planning to take help of experts from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to choose right type of plants in the upcoming plantation season for better results.
 
 The civic officials were supposed to increase the green cover of the city by 3%, but they came to know about this scheme when almost one year had lapsed. They started preparing their detailed project reports and decided to develop five parks in five years, but even after submitting the DPR for two parks, the project could not take off in the absence of funds. The Union government will pay its share, but the state government and MC will also have to pay their shares.
 
 An official claimed that MC has a total of 160 sq km area under its jurisdiction, but green cover is far less as compared to the total area. It was primarily because the horticulture branch has not been taken seriously in the past and they have struggled even to purchase saplings. He said even if the Union government gives half of the total cost, the project wonâ€™t kick off right now.
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said that they are aware of the lesser green cover in the city. He said the MC had to shift plants from Ferozepur Road due to work on elevated road project. They would now plan to consult the horticulture experts from PAU. He said plantation season is going on, but this time they will seek guidance from PAU experts before purchasing the plants. He said they will ask about best plants for this season, which will be planted in the available space.
