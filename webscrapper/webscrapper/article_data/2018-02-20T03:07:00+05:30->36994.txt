Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh Electricity   have threatened the state government of a strike if their demands for job regularisation are not met. Around 3,000 contract employees participated in ‘Chalo Vijayawada’ rally, and demonstrated against the state government, here on Monday.

 Addressing the contract employees, who came from all the 13 districts of the state, United Forum for Contract Electricity Employees president Chandriah, said, “the Telugu Desam Party, which promised to regularise hundreds of contract workers before the general elections in 2014, has ignored their demands. The state government is ignoring the Supreme Court judgement on equal pay for equal work.”
 
 The workers said they have been asking the discoms and the electricity board for the past four years to regularise contract employees as they are finding it difficult to make ends meet with their low salaries.
 
 “Some 24,000 people are working as contract employees, and most are leading a pathetic life with poor salaries, and we are agitating for two decades to get them recognised as permanent employees,” said Chandriah.
 
 K Venkatesh, a contract employee from Anantapur, said, “Contract employees are the ones who work on the ground, and hundreds of such employees are losing their life because of electrocution, and that there is no proper compensation given to their families. Hundreds of contract employees have died on duty. Their families are literally on the road.” 
 
 He asked the APSEB to provide job security and Rs 20 lakh compensation in case of accidental death, along with permanent employment to one person from the deceased’s family. Employees said they can’t wait for longer by trusting the ambiguous statements given by the government, and will resort to a severe action soon.
 
 Various political parties including, the Congress, YSR Congress, Communist Party of India, CPM, and trade unions have extended their support to the workers.
