GREATER NOIDA: In a first for the state, the   Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) is planning to switch to the   concept from October 2 this year. “We will go completely  , trials for which will be launched on August 15,”   CEO Arunvir Singh told TOI on Thursday, after viewing a presentation on the project.

 According to officials, the Authority started the conversion from paper to e-office in a phase-wise manner from February 2016. “Last year, we implemented the concept as a pilot project in the personnel department. We have already scanned 30,000 from a total of 40,000 files for implementing the project. We are yet to complete classifying of documents and defining certain job descriptions,” Singh said. 
 
 “This should be completed in the next fortnight, after which we would be ready for trials on August 15. The project will be launched on October 2,” he added.
 
 The CEO said the objective was to make governance transparent and timely by cutting red tape, weeding out corruption and speeding up decision-making. “Once paperless, every department will rely entirely on communication online, dispensing with paper files,” he said.
 
 As part of the e-office project, YEIDA had also launched a file tracking system, postal tracking system, government order tracking system, RTI applications tracking system, infrastructure project information and legal monitoring of pending cases last year. “All these systems have been linked for making the office paperless, and for easy retrieval of information. Officials have been given user names and passwords to access the systems,” Singh said. 
 
 “The move to reduce paper and make all dealings online will be immensely beneficial, as it creates an irreversible trail of correspondence,” he said.
