A song and talkie part will be filmed in this schedule, which will last for 15 days.

 "Naga Chaitanya's intriguing first look of 'Savyasaachi' created a strong impact and has increased expectations. ' ' literally means ambidextrous, a person who is powered to use both hands skilfully at a time. Expectations are pretty high on 'Savyasachi' as Chaitanya and Chandoo Mondeti’s previous film ‘Premam’ was a super hit," revealed a source from the film's unit. 
 
 The film, which is being produced by Naveen Yerneni, Y Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri under Mythri Movie Makers banner, also stars   in a pivotal role, while   will be seen as Chaitanya's sister. 
 
 "Chandoo is shaping Savyasachi into a stylish action thriller with excellent technical values. The film will also have a bit of action and drama and will appeal to sections of the audience," the source added. 
 
 Also featuring   as the female lead, the film is slated to hit screens in the second half of the year.
