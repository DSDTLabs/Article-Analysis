Bhandarkar had donated to the Institute his collection of the 2700 books which forms the Bhandarkar Collection of the Library. All the books in this collection are more than hundred years old. This collection has been digitized so that these rare books need not be handled any more. A separate hall in the Guest House is being developed as the R. G. Bhandarkar Books Gallery.
