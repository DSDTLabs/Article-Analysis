  Advocate Vijay Thakur, who appeared for the two managers, came down heavily on the police. 
 
  "Section 304 is not applicable against the two managers and the police could have invoked section 304A (causing death by negligence)," Thakur said.

  He said the two were innocent and demanded that they be released on bail. 
 
  "What will the police achieve by arresting or harassing them?" he said. "Those given permission for the construction and the BMC officials should be booked for the crime and police should arrest the owners. The owners have been shown wanted and they will now apply for anticipatory bail."
