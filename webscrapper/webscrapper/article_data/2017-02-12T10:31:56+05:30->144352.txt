BHUBANESWAR: Who would have known that a corner of Balangir district would witness the realisations of an old philosophy: beauty is skin deep and cosmetics do not help. 

 Which is exactly what people in Sulekela village of   block in the district discovered when police on Saturday seized 350 packages containing cosmetic items. Most of the packages had stickers with the face of a panchayat election candidate stuck on them. 
 
 The implication is that local BJD leader and samiti member aspirant   had reportedly aimed to woo voters by distributing these items to them for free.
 
 Acting on a tip off, police seized the packages, which were cartons meant for sweets, and opened them to discover soaps, perfumes, fairness creams and strips of bindis. 
 
 "We have seized the gifts. They have the sticker of a candidate who is contesting in the upcoming elections. But we are looking into the matter to check whether the items were dispatched by him or whether his photograph was stuck on them as an act of mischief," said Balangir SP Ashis Singh. 
 
 Khamari, a popular leader in the area, was elected a zilla parishad member from zone 24 in the last rural election. 
 
 "This is a conspiracy by opposition parties. I have never purchased such gift items to distribute among people. We only give 'pushing cards' to people to help them recognize us. Somebody has pasted my sticker on the cartons," Banamali told TOI. 
 
 The items, meanwhile, had not been distributed to voters. "The gift items had not been distributed among people. They were kept hidden near an abandoned house in the village," added Singh. He further added that police are yet to receive verbal or written complaints from any person or party functionary in this regard. 
 
 Belpada is largely considered a   bastion with the party's senior leader and   weilding considerable influence in the area.
