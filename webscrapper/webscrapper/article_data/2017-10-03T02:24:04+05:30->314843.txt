PORBANDAR: BJP national president   on Monday said the assembly elections in Gujarat would be held in the first week of December and called upon people to ensure   defeat.

 Addressing the second phase of Gujarat Gaurav Yatra in the coastal town, Shah told the crowd: “Elections in Gujarat will be held in the first week of December. Will you overwhelmingly vote for the BJP? Will you ensure BJP forms the government again?” The crowd responded ‘Yes’ in chorus.
 
 Congress vice-president   continued to come under fire from Shah who slammed him for questioning the Gujarat model of development. Shah said   should remove “Italian glasses” and put on “Gujarati spectacles” to see the development that has taken place in Gujarat under the BJP rule.
 
 “The Congress is asking us what the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has given Gujarat in the last three years. I want to remind them that the Modi government approved   for Gujarat, an international airport for Rajkot, approved raising the height of Narmada dam and allocated homes to 6 lakh urban poor,” Shah said.
 
 “However, Rahul could not see any of this. He still asks what we have done in these three years. Rahul can’t see it because he is wearing Italian glasses. To be able to see the development, he needs to remove those spectacles and wear Gujarati glasses,” Shah added. He said Congress dreamt of winning Gujarat polls but that is not possible if their partymen go on vacation to the US.
