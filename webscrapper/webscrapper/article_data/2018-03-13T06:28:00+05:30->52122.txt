NEW DELHI: Slamming   and ED for delay in probe of   deal related to the 2G spectrum allocation scam, the   on Monday asked the agencies whether it was because of involvement of some influential persons and directed them to complete the investigations in six months. 

 A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Navin Sinha said it is a very serious issue as the agencies had failed to make progress in the last four years and sought explanation for the delay. “Is there any individual’s hand due to which probe could not be completed? We will haul up all probe officers if it is not done. The country can not be kept in dark,” the bench said.
 
 The strong remark led Attorney General K K Venugopal, who has been assisting the apex court as amicus curiae in 2G scam, to wonder whether the bench was referring to Karti Chidambaram , who is an accused in Aircel-Maxis case. The court, however, said it is not concerned about any individuals and directed the agencies to file status report within two weeks. CBI had said in its charge sheet in the Aircel-Maxis case that then finance minister   had granted FIPB approval in March 2006 to a subsidiary of Maxis, owned by Ananda Krishnan, who is also an accused in the case. 
 
 Venugopal said the agencies had not been able to get information from Malaysian authorities regarding the Aircel-Maxis deal as the owner of   lived in Malaysia. The bench, however, was not satisfied with his response and said all accused must be brought to justice after completing the probe. 
 
 The bench also upheld appointment of additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta as special public prosecutor (SPP) and discharged senior advocate Anand Grover who was appointed by the apex court as SPP.
