Ludhiana: Seventeen candidates submitted their papers for different posts of office-bearers on the last date of filing of nominations for District Bar Association (DBA) elections.

 Returning officer Jatinder Pal Singh Pali said, “The filing of nomination papers had started on Tuesday. Twenty-six candidates have submitted their papers for various posts.” 
 
 Returning officers said scrutiny of papers would be held on Thursday. Candidates could withdraw their nominations till 4pm on March 23. The final list of candidates would be displayed at 4.30pm the same day. 
 
 “Electronic voting machines (EVMs) will not be used this year, as we have less time to make the required arrangements. In Assembly and Parliamentary elections, one EVM is required at a centre. But here for six different posts, a voter will have to vote six times. We will pass a resolution during a meeting of returning officers to use EVMs next year or look for modern means. Besides, we have been advised to limit expenses,” said Rakesh Gandhi, additional returning officer. 
 
 Returning officers said they were monitoring the court and advocate chambers complex and would get posters of candidates removed if any. The candidates could display posters and boards outside the complex, they added.
