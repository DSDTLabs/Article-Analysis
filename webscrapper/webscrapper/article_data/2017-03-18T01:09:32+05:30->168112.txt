Lucknow: A man was arrested on Friday in connection with the March 5 loot at Mukund Jewellers. Eight miscreants had attacked owner Praveen and his son Jitanshu and looted cash and jewels from the shop in Chowk. With the arrest of Barsal Sahu, six miscreants have been arrested so far.

 Sahu was arrested on an informer’s tip-off from Barabanki. Though he confessed to his involvement, cops could not recover gold or any other item to corroborate his role. ASP (West) Jaiprakash told Barsal had a shady past which is under probe as he had links with criminals and used to give tip-offs to criminals. Sahu introduced Vineet to other miscreants, including Rajbahadur Lodhi, Haribilas Singh, Vipin Singh and Manish Awasthi.
 
 Sahu prepared the map route and also provided logistics support. “We are trying to recover the gold,” Jaiprakash said.
