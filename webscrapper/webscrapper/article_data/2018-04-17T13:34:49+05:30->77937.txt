SURAT: Passengers going towards Delhi were left in the lurch after   (AI)   flight was grounded due to a technical snag here on Monday. 

 The flight arrived from Delhi in the morning and it was supposed to depart from Surat to Delhi when the technical snag was noticed. The flight was grounded at the airport . A spokesperson of AI at Surat said, “There was a technical snag in the aircraft. The aircraft is grounded and it will again fly to Delhi on Tuesday morning. The technical team is solving the problem in the aircraft. The passengers were given the option to travel in other flight or claim refund.”
 
 The incidents of AI flights grounding at Delhi and Surat airport have become quite frequent. In most of the incidents, the flights have been delayed for more than three hours, creating problems for the passengers, who want AI to replace its old aircraft with new ones. 
 
  (SAAC) president Sanjay Ezhawa told TOI, “The AI is operating old aircraft on Surat-Delhi and   sectors. Every time there is some or the other problems with AI aircraft. Despite many representations, the AI is yet to replace its old aircraft.”
