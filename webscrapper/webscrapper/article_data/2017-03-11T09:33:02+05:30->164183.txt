KOLKATA: The Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA), which is going to host the third Test between India and Australia from Thursday, has denied reports that it will let India skipper Virat Kohli choose the pitch for the crucial tie.

 Talking to TOI from Ran chi, chief curator   said, “It's true that we have prepared three pitches - No. 4, 5 & 7 - for the match. But I have never said anything about Kohli being allowed to have his say on the pitch for the match.”
 
 An Australian newspaper on Friday quoted Singh as saying that the three pitches at the JSCA International Stadium were of three different type and he would let Kohli decide which one suited his team most. Singh claimed that the report was not true. 
 
 JSCA secretary Debashis Chakraborty said: “SB Singh is right. We have nine pitches here at the stadium of which three have been prepared for this Test as is the norm with any other association hosting a Test match. Once the officials come here they will choose which pitch to play on. All the three pitches on offer have been used this season.”
 
 Going a step further, Charaborty said since this will be the first Test match in Ranchi, the association wants it to be a five-day affair. “Whether the pitch is flat or a turner will only be known when the match is played. Since it is the first Test the city is going to host, we would like it to be a five-day affair.”
 
 
 
 
 MUMBAI: The BCCI has made it clear to the ICC in its reply that it disagrees with match referee Chris Broad's report that the pitch for the first India-Australia Test in Pune was “poor”. The BCCI sent a strong reply to the ICC on Friday. “That wasn't a poor pitch. The Aussies scored 260 & 285 on it, after all. The definition of a poor pitch is that there's uneven bounce, and batsmen are getting hurt. Did that happen in Pune?”
