CHENNAI:   president M Karunanidhi’s health condition has improved and he is being constantly monitored by doctors. He may even make a public appearance in the month of June if doctors permit him, said his son and DMK working president  .

 “If doctors permit, Thalaivar (Karunanidhi) will even meet partymen on his birthday on June 3,” said Stalin speaking to reporters in Chennai on Monday. Karunanidhi has been out of public life for the last several months after he was discharged from the hospital in September last year. He is being treated by doctors at his residence.
 
 Stalin paid homage to workers as part of the   at the May Day Park in Chinthadripet in the city. He recalled that it was only due to DMK founder C N Annadurai and Karunanidhi that labourers are getting to celebrate May Day in Tamil Nadu.
 
 “Soon after DMK took charge in 1967, Anna introduced May 1 as a holiday for labourers. After Anna’s death when Kalaignar became chief minister, he announced that May 1 will be a paid holiday,” said Stalin. He said it was also Karunanidhi who requested then Prime Minister V P Singh to declare May 1 as a national holiday.
 
 “Ahead of the April 25 bandh, several trade unions representatives met me and said they would support the state-wide bandh for the sake of farmers. It was only after this that we had an all-party meeting where it was decided we would call for a bandh,” said Stalin.
 
 The DMK working president also wanted the Centre to come out with details on the IT raids on former chief secretary Rama Mohana Rao, state health minister C Vijayabaskar and his relatives across the state.
