CHENNAI: Just a week ahead of this year’s postgraduate medical admissions, scheduled to begin on April 4, the   has directed the Tamil Nadu government to explain whether all unaided   and deemed universities offering   surrender 50% of their seats as mandated by the Supreme Court.

 Justice N Kirubakaran, passing orders on a writ petition of a PG medical-aspirant, also directed the authorities to specify the seats surrendered, specialty-wise, since 2000.
 
 Raising a set of court queries, the judge said Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, mandated sharing of PG seats in medical colleges on 50-50 basis between the managements and governments. Pointing out that the provision had not been struck down, he said, “Therefore, all non-governmental institutions should have shared 50% of the PG medical seats with their respective state governments, especially in Tamil Nadu. So it has to be explained as to whether the government of Tamil Nadu had received 50% of postgraduate medical seats from unaided institutions from 2000 onward.”
 
 He also sought to know the total number of seats available in PG courses in each medical college in Tamil Nadu, including minority institutions and deemed universities each year, right from the year 2000. 
 
 “If non-governmental medical institutions concerned have not [shared seats according to the apex court order] , what action has been taken against them?” he said. “If no action was taken, why was no action taken against errant non-governmental medical institutions?”
