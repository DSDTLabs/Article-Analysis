NEW DELHI: Again this year,   chief   unfurled the   in a   school on   despite the state government's explicit order that only school heads can hoist the flag.

 
 Bhagwat today unfurled the flag at a school in  , just like he did last year, when despite being restrained by the district administration from hoisting the flag, he went right ahead and did it, at the Karnakiamman Higher Secondary School.
 
 
  
  
 Earlier this week, the Kerala government issued a circular stating that in that only the heads in all government institutions and educational establishments can hoist the flag.
 
 The circular, though, contradicts the Flag Code of India, which provides for a person other than the school head hoist the tricolour. Observes believed the state government's circular was aimed at Bhagwat.
 
 Last year, the then Palakkad district collector issued a memo to the Karnakiamman Higher Secondary School saying that it was not appropriate for a political leader to hoist the national flag at a school.
