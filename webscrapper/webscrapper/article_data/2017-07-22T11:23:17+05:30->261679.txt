Actor   has confirmed that 'X-Men' spin-off 'Gambit' is still in works. 

  
  
 Created by writer   and artistes   and Mike Collins, Gambit made his first appearances in 1990's Uncanny X-Men Annual #14 and Uncanny X-Men #266. "Yeah, of course (it's still happening). We're working on it right now," Tatum said. 
 
 It has not been an easy ride for 'Gambit'. There was a point when it seemed   just was not going to happen especially last summer when latest director   quit the project. 
 
 This was after first director Rupert Wyatt left due to scheduling projects.
