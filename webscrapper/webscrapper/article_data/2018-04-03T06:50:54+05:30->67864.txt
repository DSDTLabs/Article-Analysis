 Firm will have to rebuild dam: Goyal
 
 Strict action will be taken against those who are found guilty, he said.
 
 He said the government had lost a lot of money due to the accident. But the company will rebuild and repair the dam as it’s still on the defect liability of one year.
 
 According to Goyal, about 300 crore litres of water has been wasted due to the dam burst.
 
 The state government will also conduct a survey of damages suffered by houses due to flooding. House owners will be compensated for the loss, Goyal said.
 
 He said they would resume water supply from the project to Jhunjhunu, Khetri and Gothra in one month by completing the repair work, and claimed that no inferior quality construction material was used for the project. But, if something comes to light, the guilty will not be spared, he said.
