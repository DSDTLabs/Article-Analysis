Amritsar: A 50-year-old farmer, burdened with bank loans, allegedly committed suicide in Ajnala on Wednesday night. The victim, Randhir Singh, was stressed as he could not payback the loan. He had also sold off his land but still couldnâ€™t clear the bank dues. According to information, Randhir consumed a chemical used for spraying on crops. Two years ago, he had taken a study loan for his two sons. His elder son Ramandeep Singh did a diploma course and younger one Karamjit Singh is a postgraduate in science.

 Both of the them are still unemployed. Hoping to earn some extra income, Randhir had opened a grocery shop for his sons which also ran into losses. According to police, the victim had also mortgaged his house and was under constant pressure to get rid of the financial burden.
