NEW DELHI: The   is likely to give its decision on Friday on applications by liquor vend owners seeking a rethink of the court’s December 15 direction to shift such outlets away from highways as it was causing immense financial and logistical difficulties.

 Liquor vend licensees’s main plank was the huge loss of excise revenue to the state exchequer, which would adversely impact funding of welfare schemes for poor. They also argued that state excise laws, which already prescribe the distance of vends from highways, could not be unilaterally changed by the   through an omnibus order.
 
 Abench of Chief Justice   and Justices D Y Chandrachud and L N Rao said, “If the loss of revenue is as colossal as the vend licensees put it, why only seven of the 29 states and seven Union Territories have approached the SC seeking modification of the December 15 judgment? So please don’t attempt to carry the state’s burden on your back, you are just private parties.”
