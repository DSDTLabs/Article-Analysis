INDORE: Most parts of   legislative constituency on Thursday remained closed following a call for a bandh by Gurukul School Maidan Bachao Samiti to register their protest against authorities using a ground in Rau to build a police station building.

 Hundreds of protesting residents of the area and representatives from both the major political parties gathered at   and reached the divisional commissioner’s office.
 
 The agitating people led by the chairman of Rau Nagar Parishad, Shiv Dingu, former chairman   and district Congress spokesperson Shailesh Joshi handed over a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate   apprising him about their demands.
 
 The protestors said that the ground belongs to the government boys’ higher secondary school and is the only place in the area for locals and sports players to hone their skills by participating in different sports activities being held here.
 
 They claimed that there is other vacant government land available in the area and the police station’s building can be constructed there as no one will raise any objection.
 
 “Agitating residents had taken out a massive foot march on March 8 in Rau constituency and handed over a memorandum addressing the district collector, requesting him to look into the matter but to no avail,” Joshi said.
 
 He said he would approach the court if needed.
