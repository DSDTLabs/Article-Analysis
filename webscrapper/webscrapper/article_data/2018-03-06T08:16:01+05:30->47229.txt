AHMEDABAD: Giving a lift to strangers cost a trader his car, phone and wallet on the   Highway. 

 Shivprasad Rajput, 60, a medicine dealer was robbed at   by two persons whom he had given a lift on his way back from Himmatnagar to Ahmedabad. After taking over his car, the robbers dropped Rajput off at an isolated place near Siddhpur.
 
 “They held Rajput in his own car at gunpoint and then after roaming for about three hours they dropped him at an isolated place near Siddhpur in the night and fled with the car,” said   a social worker. Rajput was helped by some locals who called up Siddhpur police. “However, they told me that I should go to Himmatnagar to register an FIR as the offence had taken place there. I went to Himmatnagar police station the next day and lodged an FIR,” said Rajput.
 
 Rajput claimed that even after four days of the incident the cops have not been able to trace the robbers despite getting their   footage.
