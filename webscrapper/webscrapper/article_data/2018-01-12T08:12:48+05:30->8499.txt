AHMEDABAD: A   has filed a complaint with   for   worth Rs 34 lakh. The incident took place on Wednesday when he boarded a   to go to Panchvati Crossroads from Satellite.

 According to Satellite police, Mukesh Patadiya, 42, runs Shilp Samrat Jewellers in Soni Bazaar on Palace Road, Rajkot. On January 10, he took a car to Ahmedabad and had got off at Iskcon Crossroads at about 2.45pm. He wanted to board an AMTS bus to CG Road but after learning that the next bus will take some time to arrive, he started walking towards Satellite. “An auto driver then asked him whether he wanted to take an auto. When he said he would like to go to Nehrunagar, the driver pointed to an auto with three persons in it. They told Patadiya to put his bag near their legs so that all could sit comfortably,” said an official. Patadiya soon grew suspicious of the trio and asked the driver to stop near SPIPA and checked the contents of his bag. He found the boxes in which he had kept a total of 67 gold chains seemed lighter than they should have been. Before he could catch hold of the suspects, the auto driver zoomed off with the other passengers. Patadiya’s complaint states that 42 gold chains of different designs were stolen from the bag.
