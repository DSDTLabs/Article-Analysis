JAIPUR: After receiving accolades from social networking platforms to his department, 27-year-old constable   finally got his due. In recognition for his braveheart effort in foiling the biggest-ever robbery of possibly Rs 925 crore in cash, he was chosen for out-of-turn promotion on Sunday as head constable. 

 After special recommendations by the promotion committee, Sitaram was given promotion as a mark of recognition of his work.
 
 Sitaram had opened fire on a gang consisting of at least 13 members from inside the centralized currency chest branch of a private bank situated at C-Scheme on February 6 and foiled the attempt to rob it.
 
 "Gharan bhi bata diyo hai ki promotion mil go (I just informed my home about my promotion)," said Sitaram while speaking to TOI.
 
 Earlier in the day, the director general of police (DGP) O P   also congratulated Sitaram for the brave act. Jaipur police commissioner   too congratulated him. "His courageous act is an inspiration for all of us," said Agarwal. Sitaram was on duty at the bank when the robbers tried to break into the bank at 2.30 am. The currency chest branch had cash worth over Rs 925 crore. "I was on duty inside the bank when I heard some voices outside the shutter. From a peephole, I saw around 10 to 13 armed people trying to get inside. I opened fire from my SLR gun. Maybe they were not expecting my presence inside and ran away," said Sitaram.
