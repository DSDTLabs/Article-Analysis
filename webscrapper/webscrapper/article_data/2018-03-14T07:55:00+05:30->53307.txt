BATHINDA: In relief to farmers, the Union agriculture ministry has decreased the price of BT cotton seeds by 7.5%. The department of agriculture, cooperation and farmer welfare has issued the notification, fixing the price of Bollgard II BT cotton hybrid seed to Rs 740 per packet (450g each) from Rs 800.

 Sources said the ministry had gone ahead with the move despite resistance from seed companies. These had joined hands and tried to put pressure on the government against a drop in  . Sources said the price had been decreased to contain sale of spurious seeds, which was proving harmful for farmers.
 
 Nearly five crore cottonseed packets are sold in a year in India. Last year, Punjab, which is the seventh largest cotton producer in the country, had arranged 20 packets of cottonseeds. Sowing of these in   starts from April 1. It picks up pace from April 20 after the harvest of wheat. Cotton farmer   of   village in   said it was a welcome step and the government should also reduce the rates of pesticides and insecticides.
 
 Punjab agriculture department’s joint director   said that, “We got the notification on Tuesday about the decrease in prices of BT cotton seeds by Rs 60 per packet. Two packets of cotton seed are used for sowing in an acre.”
