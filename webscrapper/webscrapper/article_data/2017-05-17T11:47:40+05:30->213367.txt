SRIKAKULAM: In a bid to raise awareness, cops has put 30 unclaimed accident vehicles with danger signs along the 173-km long stretch of National Highway-16. 

 Ch Sridevi, RTA deputy transport commissioner, told TOI, the concept was the brainchild of Srikakulam superintendent of police J Brahma  . Nearly 30 such vehicles are kept on the central median along NH-16 as part of their efforts to prevent road accidents and raise traffic awareness, she said.
 
 “Nowhere in the state such vehicles are displayed, except in Srikakulam. Generally, highways are beautified with lawns in the central medians. But we have both at important and accident prone junctions,” Sridevi said.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Srikakulam SP J Brahma Reddy said he first implemented the concept in Visakhapatnam city when he was deputy commissioner of police (DCP) for traffic between 2009 and 2011. He had placed two unclaimed accident vehicles in Vizag city. “After joining Srikakulam in May 2016, I implemented the concept across the district. Accident rate has gone down nearly 12% from May 2016 due to the implementation of these schemes. Nearly 40% of my staff work for traffic control in the district,” Brahma Reddy said. AP Lorry Owners’ Association president   said display of such devices with caution boards are live examples of the dangers on the road. 
 
 “The vehicles represent the state after an accident. This definitely raises an alert and cautions the driver to take precautionary steps and regulate the speed moving on the highways,” Reddy said.
