  A source from the sets reveals, “Shraddha and Aditya were ready to shoot at the scheduled time but had no option but to cool their heels as they waited for the host to arrive. They were patient at first, but when the shoot was delayed by around five hours, they got miffed with Shraddha almost threatening to walk out. The shoot finally took off at 9 pm and went on till late night.”
  
  The channel’s spokesperson remained unavailable for comment.
