PATNA: The   has asked universities and colleges in the state to send their activities’ calendar regularly for the perusal of governor-cum-chancellor  .

 In a circular issued to the vice-chancellors of all the universities, the   observed that universities and colleges are centres of major academic and extra-curricular activities. “Universities are not only conducting classes, examinations and publishing results, but also organizing sports meet, debates, seminars, workshops and refresher and orientation courses,” it said.
 
 “It has been noticed that governor’s secretariat is not informed about major activities undertaken by universities and colleges affiliated to them. It is only through the newspapers and other sources of information that the governor’s secretariat comes to know about major academic and extra-curricular activities undertaken by universities and their colleges,” the circular states.
 
 Principal secretary to the chancellor   said the chancellor desires that all universities keep chancellor’s secretariat informed about major activities being undertaken at the university and college level.
 
 Acting on this circular,   (PU) has asked the heads of all postgraduate departments and principals of colleges to send the activities’ calendar and also report the major activities undertaken by their respective institutions so that the same could be forwarded to the chancellor’s secretariat.
 
 In his very first interaction with the vice-chancellors of all the universities here in November last year, the chancellor had directed the universities to frame their academic, examination and other activities calendar by March and get their academic sessions regularized at the earliest. So far, only PU has been able to regularize its academic and examination calendars. The academic sessions of all other universities are running one to two years behind the schedule, causing great inconvenience to the students.
