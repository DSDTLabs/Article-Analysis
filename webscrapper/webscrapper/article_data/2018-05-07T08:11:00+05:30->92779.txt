GURUGRAM: As many as 40 more such gyms will be set up in coming months across different locations in the city. The total cost of the project is estimated to be around Rs 1 crore.

  has inaugurated five open air gyms in the last one month in wards 3, 8, 5, 18 and 15, while two of these were inaugurated on Sunday morning by PWD minister Rao Narbir Singh and mayor Madhu Azad. 
 
 The project was initially proposed with a lesser number of gyms, but it was later revised. “The gyms have been installed in order to give the general public a place to work on their health in their neighbourhoods without expenses. More such gyms will come up in the city over the coming months,” said Azad.
 
 Six machines, including an air walker, roving machine, elliptical exerciser, air swing, seated chest press and leg press will be installed at each of these gyms. Talking about the maintenance, MCG officials said that the responsibility and maintenance of these gyms will be shared by the corporation, residents and councillors of concerned areas. “Given that many parks in the city are now maintained by the RWAs, the gyms would automatically fall under their supervision,” said Ajay Nirala, executive officer, horticulture, MCG. 
 
 MCG had set up a few open-air gyms in the city a couple of years ago, as a pilot, under corporate social responsibility fund. Although the response was good, MCG failed to assign someone the maintenance work. The proposals had come after Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar announced that big parks in all districts would have open gyms. However, nothing much had happened beyond the announcement.
