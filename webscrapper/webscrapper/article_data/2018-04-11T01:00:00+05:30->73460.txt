Barely days after her track in the historical show ' ' wrapped up, veteran actress   has bagged another show. She will be seen on ' '. She says, “Personally, I love daily soaps more than a historical as the latter demands a lot of time. There is a lot of detailing that goes into a character, right from make-up to dialogues. I will be playing Dadi in 'Bhootu', who is witty with shades of grey. I love to play such characters. My look is of a Bengali woman, which is different from what I have sported on television so far.”

 In an earlier interview to us when she gave her nod to 'Porus', the actress on staying away from acting for so long, said, “I was offered a few shows, but their sets were located quite far. So, I had no choice but to decline them. I met 'Porus’ producer   some time ago and appreciated him for the way he is making the show. Two days later, I received a call from his team and I was on board. I immediately agreed as I wasn’t doing anything for long and wanted to get back in action. The best part is that I am stationed in Umbergaon where the shoot happens and don’t have to fight traffic.”
