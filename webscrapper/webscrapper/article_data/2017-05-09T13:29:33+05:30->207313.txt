PANAJI:   has directed the member secretary of   (GCZMA) to deposit sums of Rs 10,000 each from his personal account into Pune collector’s escrow account for not implementing its orders in two separate matters of CRZ violations. Both matters have been fixed on May 30 and the member secretary has been directed to be present before the tribunal with receipts of payments of costs made by him.

 In the first case filed by activist   and others, NGT had directed GCZMA to decide a matter related to alleged conversion of a bungalow into a carpentry unit in a setback area of CRZ II of   creek, Ribandar, by July 18, 2016.
 
 The tribunal had taken note of the bungalow owner’s grievance that he had not been heard by the authority. But after allowing a few extensions in the outer limit, the tribunal had stipulated a deadline of March 18, 2017, with a condition that if the member secretary failed to comply with it, he would be saddled with costs of Rs 10,000.
 
 In the other case filed by Anthony D’Souza and another complainant, the tribunal had directed GCZMA to hear the concerned parties and complainants on November 15 and 16, 2016, and decide the matter within four weeks.
 
 The matter pertained to violations by two property owners in CRZ area of   creek. GCZMA had decided to initiate action in the matter, but at the hearing on May 5, the authority sought more time to finalize the case.
 
 But, the tribunal pointed out that the last opportunity to comply with the order had already been provided and directed the member secretary to pay the amount and furnish a receipt of the same in person at the next hearing.
