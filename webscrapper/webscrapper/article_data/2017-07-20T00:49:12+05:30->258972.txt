Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday suo motu impleaded the project directors of   (National Highways Authority of India) who are in the limits of   in Tamil Nadu and sought reports from them regarding the   available for vehicles and motorists.

 The division bench of justices K K Sasidharan and G R Swaminathan gave this direction on a public interest litigation filed by P Palanikumar from Madurai. As per the direction of the court, the officials should give a report about availability of ambulance, recovery and patrol vehicles, special lane for ambulance vehicles and rest room facility for motorists in toll plazas in the state.
 
 The petitioner told that there are two toll plazas between Trichy and Karur covering 53km. The plazas are situated at Thirupavaithurai and Manavasi. As per the National Highways Act, there should not be any toll for two lane roads. But, toll is collected in both the toll plazas.
 
  The people who collect toll should ensure quality road connectivity, hassle-free movement of vehicles, safety and other services including ambulance. But, no facility is available in both the toll plazas, the petitioner said. 
 
 Further, the public works department has to manage sand quarry operation. But, it allowed private people to quarry sand illegally. On June 17, 700 sand trucks were parked in the distance of 10km on the toll road which caused huge traffic jam in the locality. The trucks were waiting to carry sand from the Cauvery riverbed. 
 
 Hence, it was necessary to restrain the NHAI from collecting toll charges at Thirupuvaithurai and Manavasi toll plazas and direct it not to allow any vehicle to park on the toll road, the petitioner prayed. 
 
 Following it, the court impleaded the officers and sought a report from them and adjourned the case to August 1.
