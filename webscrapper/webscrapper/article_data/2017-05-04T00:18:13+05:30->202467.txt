Pune: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was cornered on Wednesday as political parties intensified their agitation over the 18-day deadlock on   in Uruli and Phursungi.

  (NCP) leader and MP Supriya Sule visited the Uruli depot and expressed support to the agitating villagers while Congress and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers staged strong protests in the city against BJP and the civic administration’s inaction in finding a solution.
 
    corporators held a meeting with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai to update him about the ongoing issue. MNS leaders staged a protest at mayor Mukta Tilak’s residence by dumping garbage near her house. Party workers raised slogans against the mayor and also guardian minister Girish Bapat for being on foreign tours while the garbage issue was taking a turn for the worse in the city. The workers have threatened to hold similar agitation outside Bapat and the municipal commissioner’s residence if the problem remained unsolved for the next eight days.
 
 Congress workers took out a protest march from the party office to   building demanding an urgent solution. The protest was led by city unit chief Ramesh Bagwe and former MLC Mohan Joshi. BJP has completely failed to resolve the issue which has led to piling up of garbage across the city, Joshi said.
