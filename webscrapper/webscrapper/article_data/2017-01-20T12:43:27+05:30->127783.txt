NASHIK: During a meeting with chief secretary   and civic officials in Mumbai on Wednesday, the   asked the municipal corporation to hand over   to the board in lieu of their land that was being used by civilians. 

 The military officials claimed that civilians have been using the area from Lam Road to Anuradha Talkies and from Kargil Gate to   road for decades. 
 
 Many commercial activities of the   (NMC) were also going on in that area and civilian traffic moved on these roads. These roads have now become very busy and congested.
 
 “They said that the area of this land is 54 acres and they asked for the same space elsewhere. The chief secretary immediately spoke to the district collector who said that he would look into the issue. But the NMC does not have a huge chunk 54 acres. These areas are have been used for many years and it is not even possible to relocate people and hand over the land to the military,” said a civic official.
