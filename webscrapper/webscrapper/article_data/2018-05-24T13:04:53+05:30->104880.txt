Indore: After protest by residents for shifting of a   shop to elsewhere from MR 9 square, a team of Indore Development Authority ( ) officials on Wednesday reached the spot for   of the shop. However, the drive was postponed till May 31 following excise officials’ intervention.

 “The land belongs to IDA. We are giving a deadline of May 31 to contractor to shift the shop. On failing to this, IDA will remove the shop,” IDA official   told the shop manager.
 
 The manager asked IDA official to give a legal notice before taking any action. “We have obtained the licence by fulfilling all terms and conditions and after obtaining all the required permissions. If IDA has any objection, they should issue us legal notice before taking further action,” the manager said.
 
 Haldhar, however, discarded the request and asked the contractor to shift the shop till May 31.
 
 “According to excise policy, we provide licence for a particular area and not for a spot. The contractor has all the rights to operate from the spot. IDA should give them a legal notice before taking the action of removal,” assistant excise officer Naresh Kumar Choubey said.
 
 He said that a case regarding ownership of the land has been filed in high court and IDA should also deal the matter accordingly.
