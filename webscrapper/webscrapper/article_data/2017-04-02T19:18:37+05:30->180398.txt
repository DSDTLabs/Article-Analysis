AGRA: After the father, it was the turn of the 'Chacha' on Sunday to publicly admonish Akhilesh for disrespecting his father and elders in the party for his lust for power.

 Though unlike  , who a day earlier minced no words in accusing Akhilesh of disrespecting him,   did not name his nephew but said those who get everything easily, squander it as easily because of their wrong and untimely decisions. Shivpal, who also chose Mainpuri to vent his feelings during an inauguration of a school, said he too was disrespected, as his name was removed from the party's star campaigners list.
 
 He said, “Jab kisi ko bina mehnat Ke sab kuch mil jata hai, woh aadmi sahi samay par faisle nahi le pata hai”. (If person get everything easily then he could not take a decision at right time). He further said many MLAs, MLCs and ministers were in the government who had never contributed anything for the party.
 
 Addressing the public, Shivpal said that he had travelled in almost every district of UP at least 10-15 times during 5-year period and surprisingly his name was not included in   during elections. He said, though he has been elected as MLA but he was not even informed for   meeting which was recently conducted.
 
 In scathing attack on Akhilesh, Shivpal said that he had never asked for any “position” but even today he holds two position including chairman of district Cooperative bank in Etawah. .
 
 On possibilities of forming a new party, he said any decision would be taken after seeking public opinion and as per directions of Netaji.
