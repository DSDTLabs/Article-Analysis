ROURKELA: Following the publication of a TOI report on salary having been deposited in the bank account of a deceased government school cook in   for the past 14 months, the district's education officer on Saturday ordered a probe. 

 The December 26 report had highlighted how the current cook at Ulundajharn Primary School in   block of the district had not been receiving her salary as a result of the error. The Sundargarh education officer has now ordered the Gurundia block education officer to conduct an investigation in the matter and submit the report as soon as possible.
 
 Fulamani   had been working as a cook to prepare the midday meal for children of the primary school until September 20, 2016, when she died. Lakra used to receive a salary of Rs 1,000 a month. After Fulamani, one   had been engaged as a cook in the school. When she expressed her inability to continue as a cook, she was replaced by one Lily   - an appointment that had been approved by the school management committee on February 28, 2017.
 
 Recently, Tirkey reported to the headmaster of the school,  , that she had not received her salary since she joined school and would need some money for Christmas.
 
 "Parvati and Lily have both served in the school as cooks after Fulamani's death, one after the other. Both their appointments had been approved by the the management committee and were intimated to the concerned authorities for necessary pay regularisation," said Kerketa.
 
 Upon discovering that Tirkey had not received any salary, Kerketa found out that Fulamani's account was where the money had been going. In the process, Parvati too had not received any salary for the time she worked.
 
 "We are shocked to know of this. We have let higher authorities know of the issue and called for necessary retrospective correction," he said.
