MUMBAI: A chargesheet has been filed against five people accused in a cheating case involving letters of credit to the tune of Rs 290 crore. A letter of credit, or LC, refers to a credit facility extended by a bank or a group of banks.

 
  The economic offences wing of the city police has filed the chargesheet. The alleged cheating case involves Parekh Alluminex Ltd (PAL), a company which has its factory in Silvassa near  . 
 
 It makes aluminium foil and aluminium containers. Besides this, Central Bu- reau of Investigation is probing six other cases against the same company for allegedly cheating a group of 21 banks to the tune of Rs 1,100 crore. 
 
 A police officer said that PAL had sought for a letter of credit for some business deals with some other companies. The other companies had alle- gedly also endorsed that they were getting into such a business transaction with PAL, the- reby voicing their accord for the credit facility. 
 
 The chargesheet which runs into more than 8,000 pages mentions that the documents submitted to the banks were fake. “The company availed of the funds purportedly to finance its business deals, but ended up diverting this money for purposes other than what the funds were meant for,” said an officer. 
 
 Another officer said that the police have now taken over the company’s factory at Silvassa. Besides, 30 bank accounts have been frozen but there was hard- ly any money in the accounts. “All the main accused played a vital role in criminal conspira- cy to avail of the credit facility of Rs 290 crore,” said the officer. 
 
 The banks eventually declared the loans as non-performing assets. In banking jargon, this refers to bad loans. Last month, three directors of various firms were arrested for cheating. Those arrested last month include director in  , director of   Premal Goragandhi, and director of   Kamlesh Kanungo.
