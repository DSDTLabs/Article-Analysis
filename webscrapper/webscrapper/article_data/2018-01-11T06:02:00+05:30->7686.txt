Nagpur: In a major relief to the farmers, the Maharashtra government informed that it would be providing five times compensation to about 41 of them from Hingna whose land was being acquired for chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s ambitious Samruddhi Corridor project.

 It informed that a notification was issued in this regard on November 24.
 
 The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Tuesday then disposed of the plea by these aggrieved farmers who had knocked its doors for increased compensation. Through counsel Pradeep Kshirsagar, they contended that the government was offering them only 2.5% compensation of the market price after Hingna was brought under the jurisdiction of city’s metropolitan region.
 
 They argued that even if their lands were brought under the ambit of the metropolitan area, they were still surviving on farming, their only source of income.
 
 They cited the case of Wardha farmers who were getting five times compensation of their lands being acquired for the project, which would pass through ten cities. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has so far acquired 2,800 acres of private land, while it has having 1,000 hectares of the government land. It has set the target to complete the project within 2020. tnn
 
 The petitioner-farmers belonged to villages like Sukli, Waifal, Datala, Pimpaldhan, Salai, and Dhaba among others.
 
 Additional government pleader Sanjay Doifode appeared on behalf of the government.
