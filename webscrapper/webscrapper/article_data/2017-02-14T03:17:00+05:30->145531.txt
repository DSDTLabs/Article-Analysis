Nagpur: “Iran’s Chabahar port is expected to open in a month. This will give a major boost to trade between India and Afghanistan since the land route through Pakistan can be avoided now,” said Afghan Consul General Mohammed Aman Amin. He was in the city along with a batch of 34 Afghan Revenue Service officers, who will be trained over a 15-day period at the National Academy of Direct Taxes (NADT) here.

 Officers of Indian Revenue Service (IRS) cadre joining income tax department are trained at the NADT before getting field postings. This is the first time that NADT will be taking in an Afghan team, though it has imparted training on tax laws to many other foreign officials.
 
 Talking to newspersons on the sidelines of the induction function, Amin said Afghanistan is keen to increase trade ties with the country. “India has been a long-term partner and has been helping Afghanistan in times of crisis on non-reciprocal basis. Though India’s gesture may have not been appreciated by some,” said the diplomat.
 
 Recently, a team from India was in Afghanistan to explore avenues for mining precious stones. The country is open for such ties in the mining business, he said 
 
 Opening of the port in Iran, which borders Afghanistan is expected to take trade ties to new levels. Many Afghan items like sweets, dry fruits and even carpets have great demand in India, said Amin.
 
 A proposal will be mooted before the Indian authorities to start a flight connecting Kabul to Mumbai too. At present, there is only a Delhi-Kabul flight, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, sources at NADT said that the team of revenue officers will be undergoing training on basic principles of taxation. The course would cover topics like investigation, assessment, capital gains, and digital forensics, apart from issues related to international taxation like transfer pricing. If any specific issues related to tax administration are raised by the trainees it also will be dealt with during the training sessions.
