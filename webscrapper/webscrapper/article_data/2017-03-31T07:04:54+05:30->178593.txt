PUNE/NASHIK: Commercial flights would connect five underserved airports in the state with cities such as Mumbai and Hyderabad following the ministry of civil aviation's announcement on the results of the first phase of the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) on Thursday.

 The ministry announced that flight operations connecting the Nanded airport with Mumbai and Hyderabad would start from June. The airports at Jalgaon, Kolhapur, Solapur and   (Nashik) would have flights to Mumbai from September.
 
 “Five airlines selected by the ministry will be using more than 90 underserved or unserved airports and airstrips in different parts of the country.  , operating under the brand name TruJet, will be operating the civil flights from the Nanded airport.Air Deccan will operate from the other four airports in the state,“ an official in the ministry said.
 
 The TOI had reported earlier that the airports at Jalgaon, Kolhapur, Solapur, Nanded and Ozar had drawn the attention of airlines under the scheme UDAN (Udey Desh Ka Har Nagrik).
 
 Private airline operator   will start services from Nashik to Mumbai and Pune in September. Sources said Air Deccan plans to operate 18-seater planes on the two routes.
 
 Aviation experts welcomed the move of connecting the underserved airports with big cities. “Maharashtra has around 28 airports and proper air connectivity should be provided to them. While the airports in Nanded, Kolhapur and Solapur have been offline since a long period, the one in Nashik demanded civil flights because it has a proper terminal building as well as a decent runway,“ aviation expert and analyst   told TOI.
