The helipad area can be used as a parking lot.”
  
  Supporting the idea, an adventure enthusiast attached to the Tiger Adventure Foundation, Tiger Solanki, says, “It would a great initiative even if they can ban vehicle movement on Sunday mornings for a few hours, as the number of cyclists are more then. Completely banning vehicle movement may prevent tourists from visiting Chamundi Hills, which could have an adverse impact on the tourism industry. For trekkers, it doesn’t matter whether vehicle movement is allowed or not. There are two trek trails to Chamundi Hills -- a pony trail and another one near the steps.” Endorsing his views, cyclist  , says, “Chamundi Hills is a favourite destination for cyclists, but there are no dedicated cycle lanes which is a potential risk for cyclists going up Chamundi Hills. If vehicles are completely banned during weekends, it would be a perfect paradise for cycling.”
