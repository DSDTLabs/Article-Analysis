 “Dream and dedication are the two important prerequisites for progress and success,” Sareshwala said in the inaugural speech. “Since conditions to do business and get loans to fuel dreams have become much simpler and easier now, I urge the youth, especially girls, to engage with the government and take benefit of its diverse welfare schemes.”
 
 Dhanani took a political potshot at Sareshwala and said: “I know Sareshwala as a person who has immense love for Prime Minister Modi. So when he invited me to this event, I decided to come because my ideology believes in love for all irrespective of caste, creed, and community.”
 
 Tiwari said that entrepreneurship and education have become important at a time when political elements are trying to discriminate in the name of caste and religion. “When there is a debate about a community, why are voices from that community not being heard? The question applies, for example, to the triple talaq issue,” he said. 
 
 Patra told participants to avail of various minority welfare schemes launched by the Modi-led government. “The life of women is not easy in this society,” he said. “But toppers in any board are girls.” Sareshwala said that over 500 took part in the workshop.
