Sanjay Dutt, who is gearing up to start work on his comeback film,  's 'Bhoomi', in Agra on January 29, is up for a grand welcome-back.

  
  
 Mirror has learnt that while his family and friends will fly to the city of the   from various parts of the world and wife Manyata will conduct the pooja on the set and give the mahurat clap. The couple's kids, Shahran and Iqra, will also be present.
 
 Trishala, the actor's 28-year-old daughter with first wife, the late  , may fly down from the US where she resides with her maternal grandparents.
 
 'Bhoomi' producer Sandeep Singh told Mirror, "We are looking at kicking off the shoot near the Taj Mahal. When the Dutts were bringing in the New Year in Dubai, I called up   bhabhi and said that if Nargisji (Dutt's mother) had been alive, I would have requested her to conduct the pooja and give the mahurat clap but since she isn't with us, I requested her to do it. She agreed to come with the children. She will be in Agra for a day for the pooja. A lot of Sanjay's friends and relatives are flying down from the US, Dubai and Mumbai for the first shot."
 
 Recounting how the 57-year-old actor came on-board the film, Sandeep said, "We met Baba through a friend and narrated the subject to him. In 10 minutes he decided that it would be his comeback film. After that I was a regular visitor at his residence. He loves to feed people and many times, he cooks himself. I had heard that Maanayata bhabhi controls his life and approves of his films but that isn't true.   cannot be controlled or managed by anyone, he is an intelligent man. She doesn't interfere in his work at all."
