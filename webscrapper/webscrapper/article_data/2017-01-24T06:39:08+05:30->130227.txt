VADODARA/ANAND: The year 2017 has brought in a golden opportunity for Congress to defeat BJP and come to power in Gujarat. Congress will never get such an opportunity to win in the state again. This is what Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said on Monday while addressing a large gathering at the   sammelan in milk city Anand.

 While urging Congress workers to expose the misdeeds of BJP government in Gujarat and NDA government at the centre, Patel said 2017 is a crucial year for   as it is the only opportunity for the party to win the polls in the state.
 
 Gujarat Congress had organised the meet over the issue of demonetization at the ground behind Uma Bhavan near Borsad chowkdi in which senior state Congress leaders including Bharatsinh Solanki, Shankersinh Vaghela,   and   from Haryana among others addressed the gathering. Accusing the Narendra Modi government for putting people under “tremendous hardship”, Patel said the policy has taken a heavy toll on the country’s economy. 
 
 “It was claimed that the difficulties arising due to the policy would come to an end on December 30 but clearly this has not been the case,” Patel said, adding that the note ban decision had robbed poor people of their money. “The poor, the farmers, labourers, the middle class and the common people are suffering the most,” said Patel, member of the Congress working committee and Member of Parliament from Gujarat. 
 
 He accused Modi for spreading lies during his tenure as Gujarat chief minister. “He is doing the same as Prime Minister of the country,” said Patel, terming demonetisation as the biggest blunder of the Prime Minister. 
 
 Calling Urjit Patel, governor of the   (RBI) a “puppet” of the NDA government, Patel also took jibes at the RBI terming it as Reverse Bank of India.
