PATNA: After the growing differences between the grand alliance partners over his statement against JD(U) president and chief minister Nitish Kumar,   chief Lalu Prasad’s family on Wednesday asked party vice-president   to refrain from attacking Nitish.

 While Lalu’s wife and former chief minister   asked Singh as well as JD(U) people to exercise restraint, her son and deputy chief minister   said, “If the trend continues, I would request party chief (Lalu) to take action against people who attack the CM or try to weaken the grand alliance in the state.” 
 
 Raghuvansh has been regularly attacking Nitish. On Tuesday, he said Nitish extended tactical help to the BJP in UP assembly polls by not contesting the election and maintaining silence on the demonetisation issue. He said Nitish stayed away from UP polls to help the saffron party despite holding many public meetings in the run-up to the election in the neighbouring state. 
 
 When asked for her comments, Rabri on Wednesday said, “It is important for everyone to maintain unity of the grand alliance and stop targeting CM on every petty issue.”
 
 Tejashwi, who is apparently unhappy over the growing differences within the alliance, went on to say that everyone, especially senior person like Raghuvansh, should avoid creating controversy. 
 
 Calling the grand alliance a compromise for power, BJP functionary Nand Kishore Yadav said no one is surprised over the infighting. “RJD and JD(U) joined hands for power and the quarrel is natural,” said Yadav.
