CHENNAI: Three years after appointing IAS officer   as court-appointed legal commissioner to probe the illegal granite mining scam in Madurai, the Madras high court on Friday officially relieved him from the responsibility. 

 A division bench of   and Justice   passed the order.The court also dismissed a plea moved by PRP granites to allow them to carry on mining in locations other than Madurai and to export the granites. 
 
 According to the petitioner, a police officer investigating the case had requested the RBI and   ports to freeze the accounts of the company and not to permit export of granite by the firm. 
 
 Though the officer meant to freeze the accounts connected to Madurai and export of granite mined at Madurai, the RBI froze the company's all accounts across the country and the port authorities were refusing to permit export of granite even from locations outside Madurai. 
 
 Counsel for the state said since the authorities could not trace the source of the granite meant for export, they were not permitted inside the ports. 
 
 Noting that if Tamil Nadu is saying illegal mining is still happening in the closed mines of Madurai, then it shows the failure of the state machinery, said the bench.
