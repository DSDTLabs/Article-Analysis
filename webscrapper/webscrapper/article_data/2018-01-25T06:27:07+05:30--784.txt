AHMEDABAD: With hardly 20 days left of the   in  , people are finding it difficult as the   are refusing to fit the plates and the HSRP at RTO has stopped collecting online fees.

 Sources in the RTO said that as soon a person applies on the HSRP website, a message is sent on his mobile asking him/her to contact the HSRP for payment of fees. The message reads “Your details have been uploaded successfully. Kindly visit Deemed Dealer/RTO to pay the HSRP fee along with all original uploaded documents.”
 
 Rajiv Patel, a senior citizen, said, “I went to several dealers to get the HSRP plate fitted but the dealers refused to do the needful stating that they have stopped fitting the plates. They did not give any reasons as to why they were refusing to do so. I was asked to contact the HSRP at RTO and found a serpentine queue there. After standing in the queue for nearly 90 minutes, I was able to pay the amount and was told to come back at 4pm on Wednesday for getting the number plate fitted.”
 
 Another person, Karan Shah, said, “After standing in the queue for two hours, I was told that I have to first apply online and then only the fee would be accepted.” He then decided to hire an agent who demanded Rs 1,000 extra for the job. The RTO officials, however, were not available for comment.
