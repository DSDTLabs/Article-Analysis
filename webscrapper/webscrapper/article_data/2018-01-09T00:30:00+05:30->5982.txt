Trichy: The 21-day long Vaikunta Ekadasi festival at Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam concluded on Monday with the observance of Nammalvar Motcham. 

 The rituals for Nammalvar Motcham were initiated by the senior priests at 6am on Monday. The idol of Nammalvar, one of the 12 supreme devotees of Lord Vishnu, was placed at the feet of Lord Namperumal, the processional deity of Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple. 
 
 Temple sources said the practice is observed in every Vaikunta Ekadasi to re-enact saint Nammalvar achieving Motcham (transcendent state) in front of Namperumal. 
 
 Around 10 lakh devotees participated in the nearly three-week-long festival. “All through the 21 days of festival, at least 10 lakh people, including 15,000 foreign nationals, thronged the temple. Crowd management was ensured at every stage of the festival,” HR&CE joint-commissioner P Jayaraman said. 
 
 HR&CE (Hindu religious and charitable endowments department) officials said the recent Unesco award for the temple had helped it attract a certain number of exclusive devotees from foreign countries like Germany and France. Srirangam well known as the ‘Boologa Vaikundam’ (heaven on Earth), is synonymous for Sri Ranganathaswamy temple, the foremost of all Divya Desam temples as per Vaishnavite belief.
