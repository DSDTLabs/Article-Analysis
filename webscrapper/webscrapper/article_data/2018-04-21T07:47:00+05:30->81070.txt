Ludhiana: The micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sector has hit out against the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) for the hike of 2.22% in the power tariffs across all categories of consumers. In addition to this, the fixed charges for industrial consumers too has been hiked, which has further angered businessmen, who are now demanding a rollback of the new tariff order.

 According to Badish Jindal, president of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association (Fopsia): “We strongly oppose the increase in   by PSERC. As per the new tariff order, the fixed charges of small power connections increased from Rs 85 per kilowatt (KW) to Rs 90 per KW. Along with this, consumption charges too have been increased from Rs 5.48 to Rs 5.58 per KW per hour (KWH). Besides, fixed charges for medium connections have been hiked from Rs 100 to Rs 115 per kilovolt ampere (KVA). Likewise, consumption charges have been increased from Rs 5.60 to Rs 5.72 per KV ampere per hour (KVAH). This shows the negative approach of the PSERC and Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) towards small and medium consumers. We condemn this tariff order, and it should be immediately withdrawn.”
 
 According to Inderjit Singh Navyug, president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA): “The new tariff order is totally anti-industry, and it has exposed PSERC and PSPCL officials who have negative attitude towards industrialists. As per the new order, power will cost more for small consumers, as both fixed charges and consumption charges have been increased for us. On the other hand, tariffs have been reduced for only large-scale industrial consumers. This is a serious situation, and we are calling a meeting of our association on the issue to discuss the next course of action.”
