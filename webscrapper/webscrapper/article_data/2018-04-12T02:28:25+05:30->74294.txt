NAVI MUMBAI:   rickshaw drivers have been allegedly harassing commuters outside   railway station by haphazardly parking on the road. The auto drivers have also been blocking the path of transport buses which leads to create chaos at the entry and exit of the station and near the bus stands. 

 The traffic police has claimed helplessness in tackling the situation by citing insufficient staff. Residents also allege that many rickshaws have been operating illegally as RTO officials are never seen checking their documents. 
 
 Nerul resident Balmurali Menon said, “I travel by train daily from Nerul to reach my office in Vashi and I witnessed the chaos daily outside the station on the east side. The miscreant auto drivers approach commuters and do not wait for their turn in a queue. 
 
 Turbhe traffic unit in-charge inspector   said, “We have got several complaints against the auto drivers outside Nerul railway station and also deployed a constable to ensure autos wait in a queue to pick up passengers. But we don’t have the manpower to provide a constable on a permanent basis and the miscreant drivers take advantage of this.” 
 
 DCP (traffic)   said the city traffic department has a manpower of 416 staffers, including those assigned with administrative work at the head office and 20 traffic units. “In order to resolve the menace of unruly auto drivers, we have been registering offences and imposing a penalty of Rs 200. But the auto drivers still indulge in unruly behaviour.”
 
 Pawar said he has written to the Vashi deputy RTO for conducting a joint operation against the drivers outside Nerul as well as Vashi railway station.
