GURUGRAM: School bus conductor Ashok Kumar (42), arrested for allegedly killing Ryan student   last week, was tortured mercilessly by police, forcing him to confess to a crime he did not commit, his lawyer Mohit Verma claimed on Friday.

 “Ashok was tortured, beaten with sticks and forced to confess. Cops and school made him a scapegoat in this case,“ said Verma after meeting Kumar in Bhondsi jail.
 
 Ashok, who was picked up hours after the murder of the Class 2 boy on the school premises, has been sent to judicial custody till September 18.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the lawyer further alleged Ashok's thumb print was taken on a piece of blank paper, which was later used by cops as his confession. “Police told Ashok they had already arrested the actual killer and that he would be booked for a smaller crime and released within a couple of days. Then he was given two injections and drugged. In this state, he was made to give thumb impressions on blank paper,“ Verma claimed. “He got to know about the charges of sodomy and murder only after reaching prison.“
 
 School gardener Harpal and driver Saurav Raghav had also alleged coercion by police to get confessions.
 
 Verma said, “Principal Neerja Batra (now suspended) had called Ashok and asked him to pick up the bleeding child. That is how his shirt got the bloodstains.
 
 But cops used it as evidence to frame him.“
 
 Ashok's father Amir Chand, who visited Bhondsi jail on Friday, said his son had been tortured. “Two policemen carried him to the meeting area. He was clearly limping. It was out of fear about the safety of his family that Ashok gave a confession. But now, he plans to tell everything in front of the judge.“
 
 Gurgaon police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar rubbished the claims. “We categorically deny such allegations. We duly followed procedure. The family was intimated at the beginning. The accused confessed and was produced in court too. He knew he had been booked for murder,“ he said.
