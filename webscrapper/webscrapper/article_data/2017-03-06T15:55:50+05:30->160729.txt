Actress-director   says she hopes Cambodians will be proud of her film 'First They Killed My Father' instead of feeling hatred or resentment for what the country endured in the late 1970s. 

  
  
 The movie throws light on the genocide in   under the   communist party's regime. "I hope this doesn't bring up hatred. I hope this doesn't bring up blame. I hope the people of this country are proud when they see it, because they see what they've survived," Jolie says. 
 
 The film is based on the autobiography of Cambodian human rights activist and friend of Jolie's  , and tells the story of the devastation inflicted on the southeast Asian nation by the Khmer Rouge. More than 2 million people out of a total population of 7 million were killed during the purge, including Ung's father, mother and two sisters. 
 
 In February, Jolie made her first official appearance since her split from   when she attended a premiere for her film in Cambodia. She was joined by all of her children at the event.
