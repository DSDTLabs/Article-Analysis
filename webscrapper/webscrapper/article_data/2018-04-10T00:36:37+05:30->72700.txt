NEW DELHI: Starting this year, students of   will have to sign an   that they will not consume  , tobacco or any other kind of   on campus or in the hostel room. 

 Until now, these rules were only part of the rule book, but considering the increasing menace of substance abuse, the administration wants to get students to sign the undertaking.
 
 Dean of students’ welfare T   said, the consumption of alcohol and tobacco was never allowed on the campus, yet students were found in possession of either alcohol or drugs and were also punished for that. “We used to rope in parents when a student was found indulging in such activities, at which point even the parents seemed helpless. We want to deter students in the beginning itself, and have also taken the assistance of the police to create sensitivity and awareness,” he said.
 
 While the prohibition of possession of narcotics and alcohol was always laid out in the rule book, the undertaking is new. 
 
 “We are going to have a new batch joining in July who will sign the undertaking, which is exactly what the rule book has been saying all these years. The current students are also being asked to sign the document,” he said.
 
 The undertaking states that any violation of the law, in reference to possession, manufacture, sale or retail of narcotics, will bring penalty as per the law, or might even lead to expulsion from the institute.
 
 The institute this year, Sreekrishnan said, wants to deter students from engaging in such activities, instead of punishing them if they are found breaking rules, which is why the undertaking has been introduced.
