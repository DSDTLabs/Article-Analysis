Iranian actress Mandana Karimi’s marriage with Gaurav Gupta hit troubled waters in July this year and the two have kept a distance since then. Mandana found solace in a social cause that was close to her heart — using sports to help underprivileged children. Her foundation, MHT (Minds & Hearts Together), assists NGOs that provide education to kids. She says, “I wanted to be in a space where I can help someone. We help existing NGOs by providing whatever we can that might help children. I am a big fan of football so we train kids and organise football matches for children who have no access to sports. We provide clothes, shoes, sports equipment, refreshments and grounds that are essential for this.” Speaking of her personal life, Mandana adds, “I got involved in this cause while I was going through a lot. I am grateful to the children. If it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t be able to cope with the sadness that surrounded me. I don’t think I am helping them. They are helping me. They are so pure and happy that being with them has changed me as a person. Gaurav and I are still officially married but he needs time to figure out what he wants, and I am just doing what makes me happy.”
