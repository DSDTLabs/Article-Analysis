PANAJI: The government has decided to upgrade blood testing facility at Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim. The facility is expected to be in place within the next two months. Currently, patients have to go to private labs for blood tests as the tests aren’t carried out at  , and patients have to pay around Rs 2,000 for the outsourced facility.

 Speaking to reporters health minister   said that he is aware of the issues in GMC in relation to the blood testing facility. People have consistently complained that they have to pay between Rs 800 to Rs 2,000 for blood tested outside GMC. Rane said that all blood tests are sent outside GMC. “I am of the opinion that no blood testing needed at GMC should go out,” Rane said, adding that even the cardiology department doesn’t have faith on the testing facility at GMC.
 
 Rane said “there are some blood sucking agents operating at GMC who are exploiting poor people”. He stated that the government hospital should have vetlab and core lab for analyzing blood samples. “In the next 60 days, we will streamline the blood testing facility and pathological lab at GMC, so that all blood testing is done at the hospital itself,” he added
 
 Rane also directed the GMC dean to opt for National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories ( ) accreditation for the pathological lab and blood bank at GMC. The government has also formed a committee under joint secretary, health department, to pursue the accreditation. 
 
 The health minister also said that the government has decided to have an independent blood bank. He said the government will procure the I STAT machine to test 29 parameters of blood by just taking two blood drops. The machine will cost the government Rs 4.5 lakh and it has requested companies to help purchase the I STAT machine under cooperate social responsibility. “Government will procure this I STAT machine under national rural health mission,” he said.
