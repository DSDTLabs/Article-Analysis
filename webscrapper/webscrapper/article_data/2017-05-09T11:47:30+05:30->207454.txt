Abir Chatterjee's knee-knocking smile almost always creates as much noise as his good acting skills. Only recently, a picture of the actor, at a wedding reception, went almost viral on Facebook. There were multiple share and comments that ranged from the classic, 'Oh, my God' to elaborate ones like, 'Chobi ta dekhe not only girls, but also j kono chele e prem e pore jabe...Again it's proved that beard men are much sexier than clean shaved men..(sic)" to smileys with hearts for eyes that say more than words ever can! What do we say about the smile? It says heaps about his happiness post   going great guns at the BO and also securing the coveted National Award for the Best Bengali Feature Film this year. 

  
  
 
 For the uninitiated, Abir had been sporting the bearded look for over 3 months and fans grew quite fond of it. Since then, he has experimented with the look and if the picture is any proof, it is only making us fall head over heels in love with him. His mustached look in 
  (2016) was also received well by fans. The actor is sporting a bearded look for 
 's Chaya o Chobi too, that's slated to release soon. A little birdie tells us that the actor loves a bearded look on himself but the Kolkata heat is making him rethink his decision. Now, now, Abir, it's hot outside but the beard? That's hotter! What do you think, fans?
