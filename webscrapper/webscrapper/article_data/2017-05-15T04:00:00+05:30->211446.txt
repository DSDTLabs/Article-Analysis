Vadodara: A Barodian has made his mark at the prestigious Rowan University in United States.  Harshdutta Pandya, who had earned seven gold medals as a Bachelors of Engineering (BE) student at M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering, has now been selected by the US varsity for awarding university scholar status. It is after a long gap that an Indian student has been selected for the honour. Rowan University, which is a public research university in Glassboro, New Jersey, has bestowed the honour of “university scholar status” to Harshdutta, for “achieving excellence academic success” in study and research during graduation by securing grade point average (GPA) 4 out of 4 during Spring 2015 to Fall 2016.  Harshdutta, who as a PhD research fellow at Rowan University, is pursuing his doctorate in “Rehabilitation and repair of bridge structures” will be conferred the award on May 19 at the inaugural function of Rowan University’s convocation ceremony at the varsity’s foundation hall.  His name will appear in the President Scholar List of Excellence and the Graduate Deans’ List for Spring 2015 and Fall 2016.  “After completing his BE in civil engineering in 2011 with seven gold medals, my son had cleared his Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) with 98.07 percentile and completed masters in engineering in structural engineering.  He was selected by Rowan University for MS-PhD integrated programme in 2014-15,” said his father Dr I I Pandya, senior teacher and former senate and syndicate member of MSU.  “Since he had earned gold medals at MSU and was also holding a masters degree, he was given credit of one year with fee exemption of US $ 16,000. Now, since he has been selected for the university scholar status, he will get scholarship and teaching assignment along with fellowship,” said Pandya, former president of Baroda University Teachers Association.
