CHENNAI: Seiminlen Doungel hit a hat-trick as   shocked   3-1 and secured their third victory of   in Guwahati on Friday. And   coach Avram Grant was a happy man. “This was our first game of the second round (phase of the league stage), and we were facing a top-placed team. So, it was not easy. But we wanted to show that we can change things around, and it’s good to start with a win,” he said.

 
 The Israeli said that NEUFC played clever football. “More than the win, I am happy with the performance of the players who showed good spirit. They played a clever, intelligent game. We scored three goals, we can score even more. And the other team that had very good attacking players had only one or two chances in the game. So, I am happy for the players,” he said.
 
 The 62-year-old lauded his players for the attitude. “They are very good boys with good attitude. They have good spirit, so it’s easy to work with them. Of course, there were things that did not work before, and we wanted them to work. It started with the game against FC Goa. They are also a top-placed team. Even last week was not a bad performance (against ATK). We lost after we created chances, but the opponent scored a fantastic goal. So, I think we should develop from game to game and pick points. The players are responding well, and the staff is doing a good job also,” Grant said.
