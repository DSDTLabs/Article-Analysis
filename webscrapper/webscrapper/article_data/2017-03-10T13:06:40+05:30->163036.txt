Nashik: A contract labourer with the civic body’s pest control department won a 10-year-long legal battle after being orally terminated from his job. The   on March 3 ordered the   (NMC) to hire the employee Vinayak Nehre back and pay him his dues. Nehre was employed with   in 2005.

 “He (Nehre) was terminated from the service orally in 2007. He had filed a case with the deputy labour commission. The counselling officer tried to make both the NMC and pest control officer see reason, but they were not interested. Hence, Nehre filed the case in the labour court under Industrial Disputes (Bombay) Rules 1957. In 2012, the NMC was ordered to restore Nehre’s job and pay him dues from August 2, 2007,” said Hafiz Shaikh, Nehre’s lawyer.
 
 The NMC then filed a writ petition in the high court. However, judge RP Sondurbaldota ordered the civic body to first pay the dues to Nehre and then only the case would be admitted.
 
 “The NMC said they paid Rs 5.5 lakh to Nehre, but could not prove it. Following this, the high court confirmed the 2012 decision of the labour court and asked the NMC to pay Nehre and take him back to work. But they refused and filed a special leave petition in the apex court,” said Shaikh.
 
 He added, “We informed the legal cell for poor people in the Supreme Court and a lawyer was appointed for him. We provided all the documents and informed our defence how the NMC has misguided the court. On March 3, the SC upheld the decision of the labour court confirmed by HC and ordered the NMC to continue Nehre’s service from August 2, 2008 and pay his dues,” said Shaikh.
 
 On being asked about the case, deputy municipal commissioner (administration)   said, “We have not yet got the court order. We will have to see it first before taking any decision.”
