JALPAIGURI: Following a 70% production loss owing to the indefinite strike in the Hills, nearly 75,000 workers in 87 Darjeeling tea gardens will remain at the receiving end.

 As the losses are mounting at over Rs 400 crore, the workers are unlikely get a single-day wage this Puja. During the all-party meeting held at Uttarkanya on Tuesday , the   demanded payment of workers' wages for the closed period along with bonus. But as per the age-old system of `no work, no pay' in tea industry , hardly any payment will be made to the garden workers, feel experts in the industry .
 
 “For bonus, we have to do calculations. And that can be done only after the gardens resume work and internet service is started. If normalcy is restored and work resumes now, the gardens will get a shape after at least three months. But then, it will be the lean season when no tea leaf is generated in the bushes. So before April there will be no revenue generation.Darjeeling Tea is a sick industry now,“ said  , secretary of DTA.
