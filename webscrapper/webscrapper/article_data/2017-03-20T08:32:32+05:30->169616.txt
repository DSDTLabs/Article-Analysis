LUCKNOW:   and   were poles apart in style during their cricketing days, but are now sailing in the same ship as   in the   cabinet in UP. Chuhan has been inducted as a cabinet minister while Raza is the Muslim Muslim face in the ministry.

 While Chauhan was known as a run-accumulator, who went on to represent India in 40 Test matches, Raza is well-known for his flamboyance and aggression. Though the latter could only play in two First Class matches for UP, many believe he could have played more but for his belligerence that antagonized the top bosses of state cricket those times.
 
 Bareilly-born Chauhan, is known for his partnership with the legendary Sunil Gavaskar as an opener. During the days when helmets were not known in cricket, Chauhan’s courage and perseverance matched up to Gavaskar’s brilliance against some fearsome pace bowling of the foreign sides to provide India some memorable starts.
 
 But, the 69-year-old Chauhan never represented UP in Ranji Trophy. His 179-match First Class career was moulded in Delhi and Maharashtra, but the man is now firmly in the saddle in UP politics, ready for another dogged innings.
 
 Raza, on the other hand played all his cricket in Lucknow, with the city’s Chowk stadium being his second home. Known for his incisive medium-pace bowling and big sixes, he developed a following in the Old City that still remains. Now, it has to be seen how successful he is during his second innings amongst his fans.
