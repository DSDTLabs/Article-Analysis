CHENNAI: The prospect of   releasing   to the city looks bleak. As per a 1981 interstate agreement, the neighbouring state must supply 12 thousand million cubic feet of water per year. But last year, the Andhra Pradesh government released only 1TMC, while this year about 3TMC has been supplied so far.

 Krishna water stored in the   reservoir in Andhra Pradesh is directed to the Poondi reservoir near the city through a 150km canal. With the absence of Krishna water inflow since March, the city’s reservoirs are set to remain dry until the northeast monsoon arrives in October. 
 
 Meanwhile,   is running out of sources to draw drinking water from. In a desperate measure, the government agency has decided to tap water from the Porur lake which has the capacity to supply only 4 million litres a day. “If there is plenty of rainfall over the Krishna river, it may lead to excess water in the Kandaleru reservoir,” said a Metrowater official. “But it does not seem likely. We will have to wait until December when the reservoirs are filled up by the northeast monsoon rainfall.”
