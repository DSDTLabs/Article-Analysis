BENGALURU: Public outcry against translocation of trees on   has deferred the project. Members of the royal family of Mysuru have declined to take up the responsibility of the pilot project, which was scheduled to commence from Thursday.

 On Wednesday evening, princess Indrakshi Devi (late  's sister) informed   that she would no longer take the initiative because her name was being dragged into the controversy. The Palike has now decided to take up the work on its own but is yet to fix a date. 
 
 Civic group Citizens for Bengaluru (CFB) has shot off a letter to the royal family members, urging them not to begin the translocation process. “We want to assure you that the translocation, in addition to having only a one per cent success rate, is completely unnecessary. As you know, the earlier Mara Kadi Bedi protest attended by over 1,000 people, plus objections of over 30,000 citizens via emails and letters that were specifically solicited by BBMP are being disregarded in an attempt to ramrod this project, which is in violation of the Town and Country Planning Act,” reads the letter. The group has demanded a public consultation be held.
 
 BBMP sources said this would only delay the process of road widening, a project which has got the nod of the   and the  . “It’s like saying there will be no blood loss during a heart operation. Do they (protesters) have no respect for the law of the land? They can be held for contempt of court in future,” said a source.
 
 Citizens feel road widening is not the solution to traffic congestion but will only cause bottlenecks on the stretch.
 
 The princess and her husband had planted the trees long ago. Earlier, BBMP had planned to cut 112 trees on Jayamahal Road.
