GURUGRAM: Police have solved the   mystery of a 54-year-old   whose body was found in the guard room of a IMT Manesar-based company in November last year after the arrest of another guard. 

 Ramakant (51), a native of Allahabad, has allegedly confessed, saying he murdered Devi Prasad, a native of UP, who used to be his next door   in Naharpu Rupa village, Gurgaon, after Prasad abused him. Both were working as security guards at different companies in the city.
 
 On November 1, Prasad, who worked with Gold Fame Technology Pvt Ltd, in Sector 4,  , was found dead in the guard room. Cops found that Prasad had a stab wound on the left side of his neck. 
 
 During the probe, cops found out that a brawl had broken out between Prasad and Ramakant some days ago. “Ramakant said Prasad had asked to borrow some money but when Ramakant failed to give him money, Prasad abused him. After this, Ramakant hatched a plan to kill Prasad,” said the police.
