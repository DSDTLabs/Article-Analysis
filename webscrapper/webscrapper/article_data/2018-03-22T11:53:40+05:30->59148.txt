NEW DELHI: Google today commemorated the 98th birth anniversary of   Katsuko   who is known for calculating how nuclear fallout was moving in the seas, which was used to limit the nuclear explosions in the oceans.

 
 Born in Tokyo, Saruhashi was awarded several awards for her pioneering work in the field of geochemistry, including the prestigious Miyake Prizeâ€” a first for a woman.
 
 She started her career by working at the Geochemical Laboratory of the Meteorological Research Institute of the Central Meteorological Observatory.
 
 Among her first notable achievements was to study the level of CO2 in seawater.
 
 In 1954, the Japanese government wanted to analyze and monitor radioactivity due to nuclear fallout in seawater and in rainfall. Saruhashi's work established that it took a year and a half for the radioactivity to reach Japan in the seawater from the site of nuclear explosion.
 
 In 1957, she became the first woman in Japan to earn a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Tokyo.
 
 Saruhashi died of pneumonia on September 29, 2007, at the age of 87.
