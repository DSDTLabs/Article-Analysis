When a group of Shiv Sena members attempted to be the moral police in Kerala in Kochi on International Women's Day, it triggered widespread outrage against the group across the State.

 Politicians, students and even actors voiced their displeasure about the incident and said that the group's conduct on the day was extremely distasteful. Actor  , who played the role of a student politician in the film ' ,' said recently to the press, "Did any of these people raise a finger in protest when numerous women were raped in various instances in our State? Also, who are they to determine whether those at Marine Drive were doing anything immodest? If at all their conduct was so, is video-graphing it and spreading it around the so-called right kind of 'moral policing?'"
 
 The actor also added that the group's claim that 'romance' is cheap is senseless. 'Think about how each of you were born,' the actor said at the event.
