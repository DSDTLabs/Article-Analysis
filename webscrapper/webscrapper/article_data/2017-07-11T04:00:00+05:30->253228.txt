Congress leaders and workers presented memoranda in this regard at all district collectors. 

 State Congress spokesperson,  , said,“Despite the severe hardships faced by the state’s farmers, the Gujarat government is not showing sympathy towards them. To help farmers in distress, the Gujarat government needs to announce a waiver of crop loans as done in Punjab, Karnataka and other states. The UPA government had waived more than Rs 72,000 crore of farmers’ debt. If the BJP government does not give this, we will give it when we win the 2017 elections.”
 
 In its memorandum the Congress said, “Due to complete negligence and irregularities in the land resurvey, a situation has arisen in the state which will lead to violent clashes between farmers and people over land ownership, as one person’s land is shown as another’s in the resurvey.”
