NEW DELHI: Your wait to take the metro to shopping destinations like Sarojini Nagar, INA, South Extension and   just got longer. 

 The extension of Delhi Metro’s   (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) from Durgabai Deshmukh   station to Lajpat Nagar will now open in July, instead of June as scheduled earlier.
 
  
  
 Managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Mangu Singh had told TOI in an interview that the corporation is ready to open two sections of the 
  to Lajpat Nagar and Shiv Vihar to Trilokpuri — in June this year. 
 
 While the extension of the operational Majlis   corridor to Lajpat Nagar has now been postponed to July, the opening of Shiv Vihar-Trilokpuri section has been rescheduled to August. The combined length of these two corridors is 27 kms.
 
 “Both the sections were scheduled to open in June but there is still some finishing work left at many stations and that is why the opening has been postponed,” a DMRC official said. 
 
 “Also, instead of opening two sections at one go, we have now decided to open them in a staggered fashion,” he added. Another section of the corridor, Lajpat Nagar to Mayur Vihar Pocket 1, is scheduled to open in September this year.
 
 At present, Lajpat Nagar is connected to the Delhi Metro network on Violet Line (Kashmere Gate-Escorts Mujesar) and in July, it will become an interchange station with the opening of the underground Lajpat Nagar metro station of the Pink Line.
 
 The new station will open right near the popular Lajpat Nagar market and will be a major attraction for shoppers, coming all the way from north and west Delhi. 
 
 Pink Line would also connect major shopping destinations of Sarojini Nagar, INA, South Extension and Lajpat Nagar through a single corridor.
