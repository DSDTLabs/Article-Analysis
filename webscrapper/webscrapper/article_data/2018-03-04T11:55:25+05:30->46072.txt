KOHIMA: The BJP-Nationalist   (NDPP) alliance is likely to form the next government in   after winning 29 of the total 60 seats in an election that gave a fractured verdict. The JD(U), which won one seat and one Independent candidate, have also pledged to support the BJP-NDPP alliance. Though JD(U) had earlier formed a pre-poll alliance with Naga People's Front ( ), it decided to back the Neiphiu Rio-led alliance taking the number to 31. 

 NPF has emerged as the single largest party with 27 seats while National People's Party (NPP), which had backed NPF, has won two seats. Both the   (12) and NDPP (17) have won two seats more than the ruling party. BJP's performance this time has been the best since it started contesting the polls in Nagaland as in 2013, it had won only one seat. 
 
 This election, NDPP put up candidates in 40 seats and BJP in 20. On Friday, NPF had submitted to governor PB Acharya a letter of its pre-poll understanding with NPP and JD(U) and also apprised him of his decision to make TR Zeliang as the alliance's CM candidate. But in a remarkable turnaround, JD(U) has decided to back the NDPP-BJP alliance now. 
 
 NPF president Shurhozelie Liezietsu had earlier said, "The people of Nagaland are with us and they want us to form the government. Our priority is to bring a solution to the Naga political problem."
