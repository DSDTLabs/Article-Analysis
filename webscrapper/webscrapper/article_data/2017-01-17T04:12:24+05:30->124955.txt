NEW DELHI: In what appears to be blatant violation of   order, the north corporation during its house meeting on Monday has gone ahead with the plan to rent out ATM spaces in over 850 properties — a majority of them in its primary schools — to fill its empty coffers.

 Parwesh Wahi, chairman of the north corporation’s standing committee, which had passed and forwarded the proposal earlier, said: “These small spaces of land are lying vacant. Apart from generating revenue, this move will provide relief to general people and banks will be able to get land at reduced prices.”
 
 These 855 locations are spread over 95 community centres, 53 hospitals and dispensaries, 6 zonal offices and over 584 municipal corporation primary schools — a major chunk of the total number. While the civic body is touting it as a step forward, there are many apprehensions over the decision flouting a 2004 HC directive that states school land can’t be used for non-educational purposes.
 
 Sanjeev Nayyar, mayor of the North corporation, said, “That in case any legal problems arise it will be taken care off.”
