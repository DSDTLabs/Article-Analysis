CHENNAI: In what could be seen as a shift in the ruling camp’s relations with Narendra Modi’s BJP, deputy chief minister   on Tuesday said no national party would find space in   going by the electoral verdict in the state, where Dravidian parties have been recording successive Victories since 1967. The reaction has come close on the heels of the bitter exchanges between   and   in the recent past over the functioning of the government, especially after the R K Nagar poll debacle.

 With Madras high court reserving its verdict in the disqualification of 18 MLAs, the political atmosphere continues to be volatile in the state. During his recent visit to New Delhi, Panneerselvam failed to make the customary visit to Prime Minister Modi’s residence. When prodded, the deputy chief minister told reporters in Tamil Nadu House that he did not seek any appointment with the PM.   MP and a senior leader in the erstwhile OPS camp, V Maitreyan did not accompany OPS. But, Maitreyan met PM with his family a week ago. “The ruling camp is under pressure to appear to distance itself from the saffron party, given the opposition jibes that AIADMK is a benami government of Modi’s BJP,” said a senior leader.
 
 A section in the party confided that it would be disastrous to have an electoral tie-up with the national party. BJP polling less than NOTA for R K Nagar byelection was the butt of jokes in social media. “OPS statement is only out of compulsion as DMK calls them our benami. In politics anything can happen. Having said that, there is no political alliance between BJP and parties in the state,” BJP national secretary H Raja said. Modi’s visit to the Gopalapuram residence to meet ailing DMK chief M Karunanidhi caused some anxiety to DMK ally Congress.
