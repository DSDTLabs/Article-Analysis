Shimla: The Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government has transferred Solan deputy commissioner and Baddi SP on charges of “mismanagement during the recent visit of governor Acharya Dev Vrat and the chief minister to the district”. On Thursday, the two had visited Solan district during their trip to Baddi. 

 The programme was afflicted with chaos exposing the inefficiency of the administration. Immediately after the CM’s return, the state government transferred Solan deputy commissioner Hans Raj and Baddi SP Gaurav Singh.
 
 A state government spokesman said that the new regime on the first day of assuming office, had made it clear that it was committed to provide a transparent, clean and accountable administration to the people. In this regard, every officer has to work with total commitment, zeal and dedication, so that the objective of good governance was achieved, he said.
 
 He added that during the recent visit of the governor and the CM to Baddi area, last-minute changes were made in the itinerary and the district administration failed in coordination in this regard, leading to complete mismanagement causing inconvenience to the general public.
 
 The spokesman said the failure of the administration was viewed with utmost seriousness at the highest level and the officers responsible were shifted. He claimed that the government would not hesitate to take similar actions in the future against erring officers caught for being negligent on the job.
