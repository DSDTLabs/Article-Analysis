AHMEDABAD:  , the tallest leader of the Koli community in  , is called “Bhai” by his supporters. Kolis constitute nearly 20% of Saurashtra, according to Solanki, 57, the Bhavnagar (rural) MLA and fisheries minister. On Tuesday, Solanki expressed his displeasure over the limited role given to him in the   government. 

 Solanki commands his own brigade of  , a collective of more than 10,000 young footsoldiers. He had been brought from Mumbai in 1998 to woo Koli voters. Solanki’s father belonged to Dhara Bandar village of Amreli. 
 
 Before ‘Bhai’ shifted base to Gujarat in 1998, he was already a TADA detainee and had been accused in half-a-dozen criminal cases, including murder and rioting; most of these were registered in Mumbai in connection with the riots after the Babri demolition of 1993. His name even figured in the Srikrishna commission report. Bhai was originally brought into Gujarat politics by BJP rebel  , who had formed the Rashtriya Janata Party. But soon Solanki defected to the BJP on Keshubhai Patel’s invitation and fought the 1998 elections and became a minister of state. He was appointed minister again in 2002 by Narendra Modi, who was chief minister at the time.
 
 In the Modi government’s second term in 2007, Solanki was appointed to the cabinet and given the fisheries ministry. But in June 2008, he became embroiled in a Rs 400 crore fisheries contract scam. For a brief period in the Anandiben Patel government, he was not a minister; but she inducted him later. He has also held the portfolios of labour and employment, animal husbandry, and cow breeding. But in the previous two governments, he has been assigned only the fisheries department.
