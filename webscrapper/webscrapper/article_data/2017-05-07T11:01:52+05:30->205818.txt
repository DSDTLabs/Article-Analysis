CHANDIGARH: One particular resident from Chandigarh's southern areas has created a record of sorts by sending nothing less than 300   through the centralized public grievance redress and monitoring system ( ) at the   "He puts one grievance daily and almost all are personal in nature," an official told 

 Complaints in the centralized grievance system go directly to the PMO where they are sorted by city and sent to the various authorities in each city to take action. Dr S B Deepak Kumar, Chandigarh IT secretary, who personally monitors the system, says, "We send real grievances to the departments they are related to and dispose of frivolous ones at our own level. Residents must send only their serious grievances to the PMO so that their issues are resolved."
 
 Three employees of the Chandigarh administration and two senior officers monitor grievances from PMO on a daily basis. One of the officials told TOI, "When a complaint is serious, we track it and try and find a solution. But having to employ a couple of people just to sift through senseless complaints can often be a painful task. An effective mechanism will become less effective if people don't use it properly."
