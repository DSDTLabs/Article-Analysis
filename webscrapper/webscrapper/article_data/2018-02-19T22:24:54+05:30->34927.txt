CENTURION: After leading India to their maiden ODI series victory on South African soil, captain   thanked wife   for being a pillar of strength during tough times.

 
 
 
 
 "People who are close to me deserve a lot of credit. My wife has kept me going throughout the tour. I am grateful for that. Obviously, you want to lead from the front, and that's a wonderful feeling,"   said at the post-match presentation ceremony.
 
 His form has been 'Bradmanesque' in ODIs and Kohli wants to make "each and every remaining day" of his international career count.
 
 The Indian captain scored a staggering 558 runs in India's 5-1 ODI series victory against South Africa and is now ready to scale greater heights.
 
 "I have got eight or nine years left in my career and I want to make the most of every day. It's a blessing that I am healthy and getting to captain my country," Kohli said.
 
 
 
 
 The skipper said that he was in right frame of mind while batting on Friday. He scored an unbeaten 129 off 96 balls in India's eight-wicket win in the final match.
 
 "It was a day where I felt really good. Last game, I was not in the right kind of mindset. This is a beautiful place to bat under lights. That's the idea behind bowling first. I like setting up for the short ball. It was a blessing in disguise, and they kept bowling short. I think the pitch got better to bat on under lights."
 
 Kohli termed the current tour as a roller-coaster ride.
 
 "It has been a roller-coaster till now. They have shown great character - especially the two young spinners.   ( ) at the top, Rohit. The way the series went augurs well for us. We are looking forward to the T20s. The tour is not over yet," his voice had a note of caution.
