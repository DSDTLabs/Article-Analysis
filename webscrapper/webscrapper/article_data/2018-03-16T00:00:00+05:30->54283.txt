For a newcomer director, who has had no prior ties to the industry before taking the plunge with Idam Premam Jeeevanam (IPJ),   is cool as a cucumber as the film — which he has produced, along with Gokul NK and Naveen Kumar JP under Riona Productions — hits theatres today. His composure, he says, comes from the fact that he is confident about having brought his vision to the screen and his firm belief that audiences will relate to it. For starters, Raghavanka believes that he is presenting a   that will work for audiences across age groups. “More importantly, IPJ is a film that will earn me respect from audiences,” he says.
The trigger for this engineer-turned-filmmaker to take to cinema was an incident from his childhood. “I was still in school when my father bought a poster of   from Bengaluru to the small town of   — where we lived — and pasted it on the door of the room, since I admired him a lot. That was the first instance that made me think about the lengths parents will go to try and fulfill the wishes of their kids and how much they observe and love their kids. They are the only ones who will stand by you at all times,” says Raghavanka.
 IPJ, he adds, explores the importance of parents in the life of modern-day youth and the infinite love they share for each other. “The story unfolds in a simple middle-class family and explores subtle emotions and moments between the characters. The narrative is such that there will be moments that make you smile, think and maybe even cry,” says the director.
