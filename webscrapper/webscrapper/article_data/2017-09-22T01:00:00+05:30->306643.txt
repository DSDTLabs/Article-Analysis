Some actor-director combinations work magic at the box office. Among them is Ajith-Siva. The two have teamed up thrice in the past and their films —  ,   and   — have fared well at the counter. And now, the buzz is that the duo is set to come together for the fourth time.

 A source says, “Though nothing is on paper now,   and   will be teaming up again soon. The actor is recuperating from his surgery now and Siva is working on a script. While their first film had a rural script, their second venture together was an urban entertainer. Their recent release was shot in international locales. Siva wants to ensure their next is different from their previous movies.”
 While there have been reports of Anirudh joining the team, nothing has been finalised yet.
