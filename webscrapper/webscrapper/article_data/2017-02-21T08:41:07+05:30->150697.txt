HOWRAH: The family of Rajat Chowdhury, the business facilitator of Union Bank of India’s Uluberia branch whose body was recovered from the railway tracks on February 9, is likely to seek a CBI probe if the   (GRP) fails to arrest the accused, including bank manager Chinmoy Dutta. Till Friday, the matter was being probed by the  . On Saturday, the additional chief judicial magistrate’s court in Uluberia handed over investigations to the GRP as Chowdhury’s body was found on railway tracks. 

 “We had made some progress in the matter. Now, all documents, CCTV footage and findings have been handed over to the GRP as per the court’s directive. There will be no joint investigation though Chowdhury’s widow lodged her complaint at the Uluberia police station,” said Sumit Kumar, SP (rural), Howrah.
 
 “We can’t say anything yet. We haven’t gone through the documents as of now,” said Amit Kumar Singh, superintendent of railway police, Kharagpur.
 
 The family sounded disheartened at the court’s decision. “We had been told the handwriting on the so-called confessional note didn’t match that of my uncle. There is likely to be delay now. We suspect the accused will take advantage of this and even get anticipatory bail. We have urged the GRP to arrest them. They can do so based on our complaint. We also plan to meet the CM and seek justice. If nothing happens, we shall seek a CBI probe,” said  , nephew of the deceased.
