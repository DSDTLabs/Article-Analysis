Justin Bieber’s Mumbai performance fetched the state government a cool, though not unexpected, `3 crore approximately. Around 45,000 Beliebers thronged the stadium to see the Canadian pop star sing live. But turns out, the singer wasn’t as true to his fans as they expected him to be. While concert-goers were looking forward to hearing him improvise his studio songs on stage, little did they know Bieber would lip-sync 12 tracks out of his set. The funniest part? The singer didn’t even try to make the put-on act believable. As comic Ashish Shakya from All India Bak**d (AIB) rightly noted in a Facebook post, “Bieber was wiping his face with a towel such that the towel covered his entire face, and the vocals just played on unchanged.” Is lip-syncing at live gigs, where fans brave the sweltering heat and pricey tickets just to hear their idol sing, really fair to them? Artists weigh in on the practice.
