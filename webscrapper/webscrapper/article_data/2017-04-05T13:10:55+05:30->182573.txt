NEW DELHI: External affairs minister   said that "not all attacks are racial" after opposition members raised concern over the attacks on Nigerians in the   on Wednesday.

 "The incident took place when some miscreants took advantage of the anger among locals in the death of 19-year-old Manish allegedly due to drug overdose,"Sushma said, adding, Än independent inquiry is already underway into the two incidents, including that of Kenyan national."
 
 She also said that six people have been arrested in the case.
 
 "Before inquiry is completed, please don't say it is driven by racial discrimination," the Union Minister said.
 
 On the Kenyan national issue, she said,"When we checked the visa of the woman (Kenyan national), it had expired months ago. Just because she said something, one cannot level allegations of racial discrimination."
 
 On March 27, four Nigerian were severely beaten up in a neighbourhood in Greater Noida, after residents there suspected them of peddling drugs to a teenager who died of a drug overdose.
 
 Meanwhile, Sushma also termed the African envoys' statement on attacks as "unfortunate, painful and surprising".
 
 Yesterday, the heads of missions of African countries in India have slammed physical attacks on their compatriots in the as "xenophobic and racial" in nature, saying the government in New Delhi took no “known, sufficient and visible” deterrent action despite such incidents happening in the past.
 
 In a strongly-worded press statement that is set to embarrass New Delhi, the envoys of 44 African nations, called for an independent investigation by the   as well as other human rights bodies, and also to comprehensively report the matter to the Commission of the African Union.
