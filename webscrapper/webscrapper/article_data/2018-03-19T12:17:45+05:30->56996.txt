The name who took   folk music to another level,   is no more between us. The 80-year-old ace singer expired in a road accident near Amargarh town on Sunday.

 Around noon, Karamjit Dhuri was allegedly returning from Bargain Village to Dhuri, when a motorcycle hit his two-wheeler from behind. According to the police, the singer was sitting on the pillion seat while his companion, Inqilab Singh was riding the vehicle. The Amargarh deputy superintendent of police,   also allegedly added that as soon as the singer was rushed to a private hospital in Patiala, the doctors declared him dead. On the other hand, Inqilab Singh reportedly suffered minor injuries.
 
 Karamjit gifted some of the best folk songs to the world like ‘Rab Naal Thagian’, ‘Hoondia Shaheed Jorhian’, ‘Nanak Dukhiya Sadh Sansar’ ‘, ‘Mitran Di Loon Di Dali’ and many more. Punjabi poet   paid tribute to Dhuri and said, “He sang folk songs for over 30 years during cultural programmes at Kila Raipur sports festival.
