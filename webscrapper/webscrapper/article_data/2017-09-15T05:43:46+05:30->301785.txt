I have done quite a few commercials.On August 28, I got an email around 6pm from someone called `Instagramhacker2'. He told me he was verifying all Instagram accounts and I should submit personal information. As his email carried an Instagram logo, I believed him to be genuine and sent across my details,“ she stated in her complaint.
 
 Subsequently , she found her Instagram account was locked.“The new username displayed on my account was that of `Green Squad Hackers'. Thereafter, I received around 40 to 50 emails from `Instagramhacker2.' Every email contained the same three words, `how are you?' From September 11, I started receiving phone calls from unknown people. I checked my Instagram account again and found my email address and cellphone number displayed on the page,“ she added.
 
 The singer stated that she has created a new account but the phone calls haven't stopped. She has now deactivated her phone number.
