MUMBAI: The   police on Tuesday arrested   Manish Kabra (49) charged for alleged negligence for the massive fire that broke last week after a LPG cylinder exploded at the under construction site which led to the death of nine   and injured another eight people who are in the hospital.

 Kabra was   after the police probe found him guilty for not following safety measures. “He had undertaken the construction work and it was his responsibility to ensure safety and security of the labourers. He has been remanded in judicial custody,” said a police officer of the Juhu police station.
 
 After the incident, police arrested the supervisor Prashant More (38) and site engineer Kiran Patel (50). The FIR was registered last week on Thursday after the major fire gutted the ground floor of 13-storey   near Kaifi Azmi Park in Juhu, around 10 pm on last Wednesday. 
 
 The blast took place on the mezzanine floor and the temporary structure collapsed thus trapping people on the ground floor. 
 
 Around 30 labourers along with their families lived in the 15 makeshift houses on the ground floor and temporarily built mezzanine floor.
