LUCKNOW: The most awaited moment of happiness for Lakshmi and Amit Chauhan turned tragic when their newborn boy went missing from the women and child hospital (Bal Mahila Chikitsalay) in   area here on Wednesday evening. 

 Though Ghazipur police has lodged an FIR against unknown persons for kidnapping (section 363) and hospital administration is expressing helplessness. Talking to reporters, Amit Chauhan, said, “Lakshmi was admitted to Monday and the baby was born on Tuesday.” 
 
 Resident of sector-c Indiranagar, Chauhan said, “The baby was lying by the mother;s side when I left the hospital around 1pm. When I returned, I found the baby was not there while Lakshmi was asleep. My relatives and hospital staff started searching for the baby everywhere but to no avail. Eventually, we lodged an FIR.” 
 
 Station head officer, Ghazipur Deepak Dubey said, “We have acquired the   footage. But so far, it has not revealed anything. All we can say on the basis of the footage is that the culprit is a woman but we cannot identify her because her face is covered.” Dubey said the involvement of a human trafficking racket cannot be ruled out. 
 
 Family and friends were trying to find the baby in public vehicles. Several relatives blamed poor security arrangements at the hospital for the incident and demanded action against the hospital administration. Hospital suprintendent Dr Archana denied the allegation but had little to say in defence. 
 
 In another incident, body of a newborn   was found near a residential apartment on Kursi Road under Gudamba police circle. Talking to TOI, station house officer R K Singh said, “The baby might have been the one   from Indiranagar. We would get a DNA test of the baby done to establish if Amit and Lakshmi were the parents.”
