GHAZIABAD:   MLA   wrote to the UP chief minister’s office on Tuesday demanding implementation of an act to regulate maintenance and operation of lifts in highrise apartments in the state. The letter was written in the backdrop of a petition filed in the matter by the   (FedAOA) of Ghaziabad.

 Sharma said while highrise apartments have increased across the state, particularly in NCR, there is no law or policy to govern the installation, operation and maintenance of these lifts. 
 
 “After lifts are installed by builders, it remains noone’s objective to ensure that they are properly maintained and serviced. As a result, accidents pertaining to lifts are reported regularly. The FedAOA wrote to the former chief minister regarding implementation of a Lift Act. However, no action was taken by their government,” Sharma said.
 
 The FedAOA had filed the public interest litigation in Allahabad High Court in May 2015 which is still pending. Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) had sent a set of detailed provisions for incorporation in the Lift Act in the year 2016.
 
 “The high court had directed the principal secretary to the chief minister in the   government to file a reply as to why a Lift Act has not been enacted in the state. The reply was never filed. We hope the present government, which is empathetic to the plight of NCR residents living in high-rises, enacts a Lift Act,” said federation president Alok Kumar.
