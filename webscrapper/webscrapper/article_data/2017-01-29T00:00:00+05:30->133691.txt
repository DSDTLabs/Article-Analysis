Bengaluru is home to several entrepreneurs, and many of them need their products to be delivered across the city in short periods of time. In such cases, regular courier companies get ruled out since they usually take around 24 hours to make the  , and many do not accept food items, such as baked goodies. So, what do you do when you, a baker, want to deliver, say, a cake, across town in a couple of hours? You get creative and book a cab to ship it.

 Baker Shweta Chauhan, who lives in  , has clients in far off areas like   and  . Her biggest concern was the amount of time spent in travelling long distances across the city to make deliveries. But all that was sorted out around five months ago, when, after being advised by fellow bakers, she started booking   to make the deliveries instead — the cabs ferry only her products, and not her. 
 
 
  
 “It’s very easy and I have saved a lot of time and effort. I haven’t faced any issues with the deliveries so far; if a cabbie doesn’t want to make the delivery, I cancel the booking and, usually, another cab is booked in a matter of minutes, and the delivery is carried out. I have sent consignments worth `60,000 which have been delivered safely. I even use the carpooling option, which has reduced delivery costs further,” she says.
 
 While this may be a convenient option for entrepreneurs, cabbies are not very comfortable with becoming delivery boys. Shashi HS, a cab driver, found himself in such a situation, and only agreed to deliver the item because it was not covered. “There is no way to know what is inside covered boxes. What if it’s something illegal? Also, the roads in the city are such that there are chances of the parcel falling off the seat and breaking. I will be held responsible if that happens. We are supposed to drive people, not products,” he says. Will he be willing to transport products in the future? “No. I would request that the booking be cancelled. It’s too risky,” says Shashi.
