 The 63-year-old former Indian skipper said: “I am overjoyed and it is like setting a record straight. But more importantly , I believe the recognition is a big leap for women's cricket. We were overlooked for the award for over a decade. 
 
 This is a big step forward and I'm sure from now on, other women players who deserve it will get it,“ she said, before adding, “ It feels like we have stormed the male bastion!“ Talking about the changes in women's cricket, Shantha said, “Over the past few years women's cricket has been on an upswing. The BCCI has been receptive and the central contracts stand testimony to that. I feel finally there is light at the end of the tunnel for women's cricket. I'm an eternal optimist and always believed the current generation should get what we didn't.   being a part of COA is a big boost.She knows women's cricket like the back of her hand. Things now look rosy and it is up to the players to brighten it up.”

It is because of them that hundreds of women cricketers are employed with Railways today. In 2006 the women's cricket team was travelling to England and BCCI offered to foot the bill. That was the turning point for women's cricket and soon BCCI took over the women's cricket. Sharad Pawar played a big role, introducing good schemes like pension despite some opposition within the system. Under Anurag Thakur the central contract was implemented.”
