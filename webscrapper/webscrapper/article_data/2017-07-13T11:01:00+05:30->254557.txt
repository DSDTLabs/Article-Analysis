PUNE: The Pune unit of the   (NCC) will receive two twin-seater microlight training aircraft sanctioned by the   headquarters in New Delhi for the NCC, Maharashtra unit. Six aircraft were sanctioned in total for the state.

 The   has three air wings in its Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur units. The other two units will also get two aircraft each — all by March 2018, a senior NCC official told TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 He said, “The flying activity of these air wings had stopped due to various reasons including poor maintenance of aircraft. The Pune unit has started its flying activity. These new aircraft will certainly provide an impetus to the cadets as they will get realtime flying experience. The NCC plans to acquire about 150 microlight aircraft in the long run and the plan has been approved by the central government.”
 
 The government had entered into a deal with Pipistrel, a Slovenian light aircraft manufacturer in 2015. “Some of the states have got the delivery of these aircraft. In the coming phase, NCC Maharashtra will get the delivery,” he said. The aircraft has modern avionic system with adequate space in the cockpit, he added.
 
 “We have observed that flying is one of the main catalysts to motivate cadets. Hence, we strongly feel that more students in the state will opt for NCC in the near future,” another NCC officer said. 
 
 The government has been making a conscious effort towards expanding NCC not only in the city but also in rural areas.
 
  “At present, the country has about 13 lakh cadets. The NCC wants to take this number to 15 lakh,” the official said.
