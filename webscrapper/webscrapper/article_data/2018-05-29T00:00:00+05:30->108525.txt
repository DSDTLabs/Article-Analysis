 Ambareesh’s debut film   got a quiet and intimate puja and muhurat yesterday, but the actor is also going to have another big launch event soon. Letting us in on the information,   says, “It was Ambareesh’s idea that we should have a soft launch and muhurat ahead of his birthday and the shoot. We want to do another launch shortly, which we think seems right for a launch. We will sit to discuss the details and plan everything around the first week of June. The event will most probably be in the third week of June.”
Given the goodwill that   and   have among their coterie of friends, especially the 80s batch of actors, we are told that this event could have actors from across the nation gracing it to bless Abishek. We can’t wait to see what this event will be like. 
 Meanwhile, the team of Amar will begin shooting with   as the director and   as the cinematographer. The film has former Miss India finalist   as the heroine.
