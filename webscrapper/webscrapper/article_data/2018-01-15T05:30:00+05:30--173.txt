Mysuru: Arrest of a father-son duo in a recent   case led Crime Branch Police uncover three more cases of theft, including one reported five years ago.

 Riyaz Sheriff, 42, and his son Fayaz Sheriff, 22, of Hanumantha Nagar, were arrested for lifting valuables and cash, of total worth Rs 29 lakh, from an acquaintance’s home in Mysuru. They were caught within a week after the theft.
 
 The incident took place on December 31 when Sunil, a wholesaler dealer in copper, left home after locking it. The duo looted the house in the noon hours.
 
 In a similar manner, Riyaz and his son teamed up with another person, who is still absconding, to lift money and valuables from the house of Patrick, another acquaintance, in 2012 and again in 2015. Riyaz used a duplicate key that he had got done when he was frequently visiting Patrick’s house in NR Mohalla.
 
 Riyaz had earned Patrick’s trust in financial matters by promptly repaying the borrowed money and also making payments on time. When Patrick was away from home in 2012, Riyaz lifted cash and gold valuables worth Rs 7.5 lakh. However, Patrick didn’t suspect him. Again in 2015, he lifted money from Patrick’s house.
 
 CCB ACP B R Lingappa told TOI that Patrick didn’t suspect Riyaz as he was accompanying him while lodging the complaint. The cases remained unsolved as there was no forced entry.
 
 The father–son duo revealed their past crimes when police took them into custody for the second time for three days. They were in police custody for 5 days earlier, but they hadn’t disclosed their past crimes.
 
 Theft at relative’s house 
 
 Riyaz had lifted Rs 1 lakh cash from his relative’s house in Ahamed Nagar of Chamarajanagar town three years ago. In this case, too, Riyaz used a duplicate key to gain entry into the house.
 
 Interestingly, Riyaz had invited his relatives to his Mysuru home for lunch and then sent his accomplices to Chamarajanagar to commit the crime. Even this case remained unsolved since then.
