MUMBAI: A   on Friday dismissed an appeal filed by the prosecution against the   of five men alleged to have been members of the   Student Islamic Movement of India ( ). The five-Irfan Sayed, Mohammed Bakali, Firoz Ghaswala, Imran Ansari and Mohammed Chipa -who were arrested in the aftermath of the 2006 Mumbai serial train blasts were acquitted by a magistrate court in February last year. 

 The police told the court that after the blasts, there was a constant watch on extremist groups and banned organisations. During one such watch on August 4, 2006, an officer received information that Santacruz resident Irfan was involved in anti-national activities with some of his associates and working for SIMI. The officer further stated that a watch was kept on Irfan and it was found that he was in touch with Firoz, Chipa, Imran and one other person. The prosecution alleged that two among these were also arrested by the Delhi police for allegedly possessing RDX. 
 
 The prosecution alleged that after investigations and confronting the accused with each other it was allegedly revealed that the accused were active members of SIMI. Accordingly on August 13, 2006, a case was registered under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The accused were then tried by the magistrate court and 13 witnesses deposed. The court, however, found no evidence against the accused. Aggrieved, the prosecution filed an appeal. 
 
 Among the grounds seeking setting aside the acquittal, the prosecution told the sessions court that the lower court had failed to consider that cops investigating the case had seized a diary on the basis of a statement made by one the accused. The prosecution alleged that the diary showed the description of preparing a bomb with its material and was written by another one of the accused. 
 
 However, the sessions refuted the grounds cited by the prosecution and dismissed the petition.
