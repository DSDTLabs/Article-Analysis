NEW DELHI: Amid the blame game between the government and the opposition over the near washout of the  , minister for parliamentary affairs   on Wednesday announced that no BJP or   MP will take salaries or allowances for the 23 days that were wasted.

 
 Two NDA leaders told TOI that this was the unanimous view in a Cabinet meeting. This would send out a message that the 
  for the washout, they said. NDA MPs may also demonstrate at the Mahatma Gandhi statue on the last day of the session on Friday to register their stand, sources said.
 
  
  
 
 Blaming Congress for the stalemate, Kumar tweeted, "We, @BJP4India-NDA MPs have decided to forego salary & allowances for 23 days as #Parliament was not functional. Salary is to be given only if we serve people through work. Congress's undemocratic politics has made LS & RS non functional, in spite of our willingness to discuss." He told reporters that no bills getting passed had led to a "criminal wastage" of the taxpayers' money. "We discussed the issue with the Prime Minister, BJP president and NDA constituents... The money is given to us to serve the people. Since no issue of public interest was discussed and no legislative business could be transacted, we are returning the money to the people," he said. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution and Lok Janshakti Party chief   told TOI, "It was a unanimous decision. Opposition is not allowing the House to function and crucial bills which will impact people's lives could not be taken up."
 
 Last month, BJP MP from Delhi Manoj Tiwari had demanded implementation of "no work, no pay" rule in Parliament. The government and BJP are also planning a big show for the Ambedkar anniversary on April 14.
