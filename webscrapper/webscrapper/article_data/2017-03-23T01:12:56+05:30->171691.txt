NEW  : Forming roughly a third of Delhi’s total electorate, Poorvanchalis will play an important role in the municipal corporation elections. It is in this backdrop that AAP convener Arvind   will kickstart his campaigning from  , a constituency with a high percentage of   settlers.

 Since the 2015 assembly elections, AAP has enjoyed the support of Poorvanchalis, largely residing in JJ and unauthorised colonies. This time, there are other claimants to this segment, including JD(U), which is contesting all the 272 seats, and BJP, which is headed by Manoj Tiwari, a Poorvanchali himself. In fact, AAP leaders claim Tiwari was brought in precisely because BJP perceived their party as a threat. The party will launch a focused   in areas being represented by a Poorvanchali candidate or where there is a high concentration of such voters. AAP campaigners will focus on work done by their government in unauthorised areas, such as setting up of mohalla clinics and public toilets. Work done by the government on Chhat Ghats will also be highlighted.
 
 “Poorvanchalis have supported the anti-corruption movement right from the beginning. The party also has the highest representation of Poorvanchalis, whether as MLAs or simply members. The government also has two Poorvanchali ministers, Kapil Mishra and Gopal Rai,” said Ashish Talwar, Delhi in-charge for AAP.
 
 “We are confident that when the party’s Poorvanchali leadership in Delhi starts campaigning, BJP and other parties will not be able to match our presence,” he added.
 
 The   will also touch upon the impact of demonetisation, which prompted thousands of migrant workers to quit their jobs and move back to UP and Bihar.
