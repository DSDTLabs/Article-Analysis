PANAJI: Aside four sitting and former MLAs, every other elected representative in the fray for the February 4 state assembly elections has seen a jump in their assets since the last two state assembly polls.

 Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party’s (MGP) Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavlikar, the former factories and boilers minister, has seen the highest jump in his assets since 2007, recording a whopping 924% growth to touch Rs 14.44 crores in moveable and immovable assets.
 
  Meanwhile, at Rs 50 crore,   has the highest total value of assets. Rane is also the oldest MLA to be contesting the 2017 polls.
 
 Four sitting and former MLAs — Joaquim Alemao, Vijai Sardessai, Shyam Satardekar and incumbent chief minister   — have seen a drop in their asset value. 
 
 “Many candidates have given purchase price or undervalued market price of their land. There are instances of agricultural land and settlement land being valued at the same price,” said   from ADR.
