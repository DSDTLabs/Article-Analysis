Artist at heart and police officer by profession –  , Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) is often seen spending his evenings, post-work, at his studio in Amar Colony, Lajpat Nagar. In the studio, against one wall lies a wooden artwork for assessment while on the floor lies unfinished wood work. Most of the finished sculptures just came back from Alliance Francaise, where he had recently organised an exhibition titled Lakdi Jal Koyla Bhai.

 Verman, who was awarded the Lalit Kala Akademi’s National Award in 1994-1995, explains the title of his exhibition, saying, "‘Lakdi jal koyla bhayi, koyla jal bhayi rakh, main papin aisi jali, na koyla bhayi na raakh’ – this song explains the situation of the actress in the film  , who is waiting for her husband, but doesn’t know whether he is alive or dead. Similarly, I feel that I am stuck in the same situation, performing two different duties – I’m an artist at heart but my duty is policing."

 Verman carves out sculptures from logs of wood that he came across while he was posted in Mizoram. He shares, "During my long walks in the forests, I found logs of wood which weren’t totally burnt, or there were logs that were just lying around. Two years ago, when I was transferred to Delhi in the EOW ( ), I brought these logs to Delhi along with me. Earlier this year, I started my wood work, and it was quite a satisfying experience. I am thinking of doing it more frequently now.” He is as passionate about sculpting as he is about policing. He says, “For me, policing is passion, art is more than a hobby – it is my life. Wood is hypnotic, if you look at it for long, you will realise that something is attempting to break through. It’s thought-provoking."
