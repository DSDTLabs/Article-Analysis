THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A special active  , which covers Wayanad, Ernakulam,   will be completed in one year. 

 The drive aims to cover 50 districts across the country, out of which four are from Kerala. About 7.81 lakh people in the four districts will be covered under the programme.
 
 The first phase of the Central government programme has been completed and the next two phases will be held in July and December.
 
 "The four districts have been selected from the state as there are certain high risk populations in these regions. The   of Thrissur and Ernakulam and   of Idukki and Wayanad have been identified as most high risk areas," said Dr Parvathy A P, additional director of health.
 
 Ernakulam and Thrissur have topped in fresh TB cases with 1,582 and 1,143 new cases in 2016.
 
 "From Idukki and Wayanad 20 to 25 fresh cases are being reported in a month, on an average. The tabulation of the exact figures we have received during the first phase of the drive is on and the exact figures of the fresh cases will be known only by then," she said.
 
 The state health department has been doing the TB eradication drive on a regular basis following which the high incident areas were identified. But the health authorities have found that case detections have been very poor in the tribal areas of Idukki and Wayanad.
 
 The special drive has been focussing on migrant labourers, tribal areas, coastal areas, remote and backward areas of Idukki and Wayanad, old age homes, etc.
 
 "The drive is similar to pulse polio campaign and it is an active fact-finding mission. We can also go into the reasons behind the increase in the cases in particular areas once the drive has been completed. The drive will also help in curtailing the spreading of the disease," said Dr Pravathy, who heads the TB wing of the state health services.
