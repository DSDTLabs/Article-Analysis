Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brains is either blocked by a clot or ruptures. When this happens, part of the brain cannot receive blood and oxygen it needs, and death of cells occurs. Healthy food habits helps to reduce three risk factors for stroke –  ,   and excess weight. Diets high in saturated fat and trans fat can raise blood cholesterol levels.   high in sodium contributes to high blood pressure, and   contributes to obesity.

 Studies have found that fiber intake has a role in preventing stroke (Graeme Hankey, MD, of Royal Perth Hospital in Australia. Dr. Hankey) reported in The Lancet in December 2011 that fiber intake appeared to lower stroke risk factors including high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Researchers at the University of Leeds analyzed various long-term studies from the US, Japan, Europe and Australia concluded that eating just seven more grams of fiber a day would lower their stroke risk. The recommended daily amount is 25 grams for women & 38 for men. Tanya Zuckerbrot, MS, RD, author of The Miracle Corb Diet: Make Calories and Fat Disappear— With Fiber says that fiber makes us less likely to be overweight by slowing our digestion and keeping us fuller for longer time. It also helps starve off high cholesterol by sopping up lipids in our blood.
 
 If anyone who suddenly upped the fiber intake, having too much roughage at once can lead to some pretty uncomfortable digestive situations in the form of constipation, bloating, and gas. To avoid constipation, be sure to drink plenty of water. Food items rich in fiber in dude lentils, nuts, black beans, peas, ladies finger, fig, coconut, berries, pears etc. Ensure that you take adequate amount of fiber in your daily diet.
