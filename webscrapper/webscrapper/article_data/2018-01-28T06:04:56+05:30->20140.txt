LUCKNOW: Armed miscreants attacked the house of a tailor in  , Malihabad, at 2am on Saturday. It happens to be the eighth strike by armed miscreants in Kakori,   region in a span of just six days.

 However, SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar denied that it was dacoity incident. Kumar told TOI that it seems to be a case of theft and investigation is under way. “Villagers are spreading rumours of dacoity. It seems someone residing in the village has committed theft,” said Kumar. SP (rural), CO (Malihabad) visited the house and will give me a report within 24 hours, he added.
 
 SSP Lucknow has sent SO Chinhat and SO Malihabad to the lines for failing to control crime in their regions and no breakthroughs in the back-toback dacoities.
 
 Aslam Khan, a tailor in Amaniganj, said in his complaint to police, “I went to relieve myself around 2am when suddenly four-five armed, masked miscreants attacked me with a sharp-edged weapon on my head. One of them tied my hands and legs,” said Khan.
 
 Later, they entered my house and looted Rs 20,000 in cash and jewellery worth lakhs. “I was bleeding profusely and had no strength. Somehow, I raised an alarm following which my neighbour Akbar woke up, but by then the criminals had escaped,” he said.
 
 The villagers claimed that they contacted UP 100 but got no response. When contacted by TOI, SP (rural) Satish Kumar contested the claims of Khan. Kumar said if such an incident had occurred why the villagers informed police only in the morning. “I am personally investigating the case, prima facie it seems to be a case of theft,” said Kumar.
 
 On Friday, DGP OP Singh had visited the areas where dacoities had taken place and had directed SSP Lucknow and IG (Lucknow Range) to crack the case at the earliest.
 
  has also been asked to trace the criminals who had committed dacoities.
