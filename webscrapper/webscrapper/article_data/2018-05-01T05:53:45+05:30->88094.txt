CHANDIGARH: Even two weeks after cabinet expansion, the   is yet to tackle the discontent among a section of party leaders aspiring for a cabinet berth in the   government.

 Sources said prominent Dalit face of the party and Amritsar (West) MLA Raj Kumar Verka again met with senior party leaders in Delhi on Monday. However, when contacted, Verka said it was only a courtesy call and he was not upset with the party over cabinet expansion at any level.
 
 Though the party leadership has offered to accommodate those left out of the cabinet in various boards and corporations, a section of these leaders are not ready to settle for such an offer. “The issue was of Dalit representation in the cabinet and it could have been any party leader,” said Sangat Singh Gilzian, who had resigned from party posts after the cabinet expansion.
 
 Meanwhile, another Congress leader said the party was yet to make any offer pertaining to heading of any corporation. “The issue has definitely been red flagged by Dalit leaders before the party high command so that the party makes up while making these appointments,” he added. 
 
 Last week, a group of Dalit leaders met with senior Congress leaders   and Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday and briefed them about the “grouse” of the SC/BC communities in the state. Later, technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi escorted Gilzian and deputy speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti to meet party president Rahul Gandhi. Priyanka Gandhi was also present during the meeting.
 
 Talking to media persons, Punjab Congress president   said the party would shortly decide on its candidate for the Shahkot by-election that is scheduled for May 28. Meanwhile, on allegations made by the AAP against local leader Hardev Singh Laddi, Jakhar said such charges and counter charges were common before any election.
