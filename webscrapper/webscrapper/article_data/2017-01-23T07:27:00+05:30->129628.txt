BCHIWIND(AMRITSAR): Having suffered losses in three consecutive seasons owing to natural reasons and demonetization, farmers of border region have joined hands ahead of the Punjab assembly elections to demand that each party fixes the   (MSP) for fruits and vegetables in its manifesto.

 Leaders of various farmer organizations, including   and   (BASC), addressed a series of meetings in the border villages on Saturday, asking people to exert pressure on their assembly candidates to include the issue of MSP for fruits and vegetables. “The recent example before us is the heavy losses suffered by farmers of potato and pea crops due to demonetisation,” said  , who owns seven acres, while addressing a gathering at Bachiwind village on Saturday.
 
 The farmers are of the view that if there was an MSP for potatoes and peas, they would have not suffered any losses since the government was bound to purchase their produce at a fixed rate, but the situation was other way round. “Peas were sold for Rs 15-20 per kg last year, but now they are sold for Rs 4-6 a kilo. Many farmers ploughed the crop in fields only,” said BASC general secretary Rattan Singh Randhawa.
 
 Anup Singh, a farmer who had lost wheat and basmati crop due to bad weather, said elections were the only time when people gave a patient hearing to them. “I am telling everyone that I will vote only if a party will fix the MSP of fruits and vegetables, and implement recommendations of  ,” he said.
 
 A farmer who had just returned from a rally by the Congress, Gurveer Singh, said that on the night of January 20, he led a delegation of farmers to meet the assembly candidates of the Congress, SAD and AAP and talked to them about their issues. “I am really confused; everyone of them promised to accept our demands if voted to power, but I don’t know who to believe,” he said.
