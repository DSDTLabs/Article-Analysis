Pune: A survey conducted by Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat has found that women   are plagued by a multitude of  . 

 The study, of a sample of 100 waste pickers from six wards, also found that the women face social rejection due to the nature of their work. 
 
 The health issues include body aches and complaints of arthritis, while social problems involve unavailability of toilet facilities and harassment.
 
 “We found that the women, who do hard work on the streets, are treated with disgust. The society does not think about their health and the nature of work. They are working for the city’s cleanliness at risk to their own health,” said Shruti Tambe, research investigator and heard of sociology at SPPU. 
 
 About 70% reported severe joint pain and body ache, 51% complained of eye problems, while 27% had frequent fever and chronic weakness, vaginal infections, and cramps during menstruation. 
 
 From each ward, two to three women from different age groups were interviewed, as were experts, activists and social workers. 
 
 “Less than 50% of the women surveyed had the ‘Janarogya Yojana’ card. The remainder had either applied for it and did not get it, or had yet to apply,” Tambe said. 
 
 The respondents said they have to contend with extreme weather conditions in the line of duty. Over 50% have sustained cuts or bruises due to needles or broken glass. Some even suffered from animal or insect bites. “A small number also reported harassment by authorities. This number may underrepresent the problem as it came forth during qualitative interviews,” said Tambe.
