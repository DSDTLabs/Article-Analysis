 The government dedicated several projects — like the multi-level parking facility,  , nursing hostel — to the people, in Ahmedabad. The day was celebrated with pomp and fervour at several locations in the city. Schoolchildren and artists from several parts of the state performed at the GMDC ground on the occasion. 
 
 Speaking at the opening of the state’s Foundation Day celebration at GMDC ground in Ahmedabad on Monday the Gujarat CM said, “While PM Narendra Modi has taken a resolution for a ‘New India’ lets take a resolution to create a new Gujarat in line with PM Modi’s vision. The new generation needs to take over the leadership.”
 
 He did not miss the opportunity to target the Congress. He claimed that, “Seventeen years ago, no government was celebrating Gujarat Foundation Day as that party (Congress) did not want the separation of Gujarat from Maharashtra. Youngsters of Gujarat were martyred to get Gujarat. Indu Chacha and Pandit Ravishankar took the lead. We started celebrating Gujarat Gaurav Divas to celebrate the state’s progress.”
 
 The CM and governor O P Kohli also witnessed the state’s Foundation Day parade at the Sabarmati riverfront. 
 
 Blacking out protests
 
 Security at GMDC ground was tightened out of fear of protesters wearing black coats streaming into the venue. Police intercepted and checked every individual for any traces of black cloth or clothing. "We are just being cautious," a senior police official claimed.
