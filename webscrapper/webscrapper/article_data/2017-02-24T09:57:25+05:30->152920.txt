PUNE: The MNS, which had emerged as the second largest party in Pune in the last  , failed thereafter to provide a solid leadership in the city. Raj Thackeray’s close aide Deepak Paigude was the party’s choice during the initial years but he has distanced himself from active politics of late. 

 Two active corporators of the party, Ravindra Dhangekar and Vasant More, wouldn’t see eye to eye and the former finally quit the party. Two of the MNS’ four corporators in Pimpri Chinchwad also left the party. The MNS is faceless in both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. 
 
 Interestingly, when party leaders and corporators were joining the opposition camps, Raj Thackeray did not initiate much efforts to retain them. 
 
 Like the MNS, the Republican Party of India ( ), the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have no strong leadership in the city. The AIMIM was particularly hoping to win more seats in the city, but failed miserably.
 
 MP Raju Shetti, president of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, which is in an alliance with the  , has accused the ruling party of trying to eliminate   from the political scene. RPI leader   has criticized the multi-member ward system, saying it will not allow smaller parties to survive. Interestingly, Dhende and other candidates had to contest on the lotus symbol in the panel system.
