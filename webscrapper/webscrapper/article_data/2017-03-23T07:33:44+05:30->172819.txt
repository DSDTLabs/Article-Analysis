The party was facing issues with the day-to-day expenses of district offices, so then CM and now PM   suggested that we carry out a fund raising drive from which the party's district and taluka units can meet their day-to-day expneses from the interest income. So far we have not planned any fund raising drive for the upcoming elections. We strictly follow the spending rules of the Election Commission of India. If required, we will work out a plan to raise funds." 
 
 Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki, about fund raising, said: "So far we have not planned any drive for fund raising. When required, we will begin accepting donations. Unlike the BJP, we don't believe in arm-twisting to get  . Our workers work for the party and not for money."
