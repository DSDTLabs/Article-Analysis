 Chandigarh: The University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET) will soon set up a skill and development programme centre for SC/ST students. All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has sanctioned a grant for the centre and   will get around Rs 23 lakh. 
 
 In the beginning, seat intake will be 30, which will gradually increase with AICTE funding. “All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has sanctioned a grant for skill and personality development programme centre for SC/ST students to the University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), Chandigarh,” said Dr Harish Kumar, professor at the department of computer science, UIET.
 
 Anyone belonging to the SC/ST category pursuing technical education will be eligible. The students will be taught resume writing and trained in communication, business ethics and interview skills. However, admission criterion has not been decided yet,” said Harish. 
 
 We applied for the AICTE scheme as students need to be trained in such skills. All students need such skills but the scheme was only available for SC/ST students. Moreover, since it has been sponsored by AICTE, training will be provided free of cost to students,” said Harish. 
 
 According to AICTE guidelines, the centre will have to organize orientation programmes to enhance students’ English proficiency and communication skills, both written and verbal. The focus should be on personality development. Lectures by eminent personalities should also be organized. 
 
 The centre should also conduct open houses, personality development workshops and competitions to test students’ degree of learning. The centre will also have to set up a feedback mechanism for students so that the curriculum is revised accordingly. The scheme rolled out by AICTE is to impart skills among SC/ST students.
