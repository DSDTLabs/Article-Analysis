PATNA: After a Holi break,   will be back again this Sunday — this time on the stretch from the police check post on Boring Road to Bikanet Sweets Mor, also called S K Puri Children’s Park Road.

 Otherwise filled with fumes emanating from motor vehicles, the stretch will be blocked for vehicular traffic from 6.30am to 9.30am on March 19 for Patnaites to rediscover the simple pleasures of community interaction.
 
 An initiative of The Times of India in partnership with the Patna Police and Patna Municipal Corporation, Happy Streets promises to leave you rejuvenated for the gruelling week ahead. You can do Zumba, cycling, yoga, hula hoops and skating; play tug of war; pitthoo, badminton, human Snakes and Ladders and cricket and enjoy musical performances, street art, street play and German master class on Happy Streets.
 
 Inspired by Ciclovia in Columbia's Bogota, Happy Streets aims to create a relaxed atmosphere to help participants unwind as well as to raise awareness about healthy living and non-motorized transport options.
 
 Conducted earlier near Gandhi Maidan on February 26 and March 5, Happy Streets was a huge success with heavy turnout of people from all walks of life — children, students, homemakers, working professionals and senior citizens. “Happy Streets is the best thing to have happened to Patna in recent times. I will do aerobics and cycling this time,” said Monu Agrawal, a city- based entrepreneur.
 
 So, see you all on S K Puri Road at 6.30am on March 19!
