MUMBAI: A city family has set up a   page to gather support and finances to enable a seven-year-old   survivor continue her schooling. Ritika Srivastava, a student of marketing, with her mother and her aunt had managed to get the girl admitted to a school in Andheri last year after they found that she was not enrolled anywhere.

 Last year, Srivastava and her family took care of the expenses as they had missed the deadline for centralized admissions under the Right to Education Act. The girl’s father is a watchman.
 
 “The response from most schools was very bad. One school finally agreed to admit her and we thought we could get a quota seat next year. But the system does not allow that as admissions happen only at entry level. If the fees aren’t paid this year, she might have to drop out. She has already made friends and in fact stood second in her class,” she said. 
 
 According to   rules, admissions can be conducted only at the entry level, that is, pre-primary or Class I. “We tried to reach out to the BMC, which conducts admissions for RTE seats, but it did not work out,” said Srivastava.
 
 The family has started a Facebook page, Bringing Change by RTE, to reach out to Mumbaikars willing to sponsor the child’s education and to demand that RTE exceptions be made in special cases. 
 
 Thousands of seats that remain vacant in the admission process continue to be vacant for the next eight years.
