TV actress   has been quite active on   and has always kept her fans updated on what is happening in the world through updates on her phone.
 
  The actress has now decided to undergo a digital detox and limit her time and presence on social media as well.
  
  Saumya, who is loved for her role of Anita Bhabhi on the popular comedy show Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hai, feels that the world is becoming a slave to technology and people are losing out on good conversations and many more things in life because of the same.
  
  Reportedly, the actress has said that technology is invading their privacy and the amount of time that she spends with her husband and friends has been reduced to being very little because of cell phones.
  
  She recently stated to an entertainment daily that when she meets her friends, one of them is constantly over the phone. Also when she is with her husband, either he is busy making calls or watching TV, there is hardly any form of communication between the two even while having dinner.
  
  
 
  
  Therefore, the actress has finally thrown light upon how cell phones are hampering personal relationships and the amount of time people spend on the phones in a day.
  
  Well, vouching for a good cause will always help the society only if everyone detoxify themselves of technology.
