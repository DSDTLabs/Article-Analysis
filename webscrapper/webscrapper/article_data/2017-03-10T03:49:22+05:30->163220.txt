NEW DELHI: Refusing to show any leniency to real estate tycoon   who had asked to be let off with the sentence already undergone in the  , the   on Thursday dismissed his plea but extended the deadline for him to surrender to complete his one year jail term till March 20.

 Gopal, who was to surrender on March 10, told a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi, Kurian Joseph and A K Goel that he was suffering from several ailments related to old age and requested that he should also be let off like his elder brother Sushil Ansal with the sentence already undergone.
 
 Senior advocate   contended that Gopal was entitled to parity with his elder brother with regard to punishment as he was suffering much more than his brother.
 
 “Kindly give me a hearing on the ground of humanity and law. I am almost a dead person. I am living on people’s help and charity. I have to look after my wife who is of my age. Even though I am entitled for acquittal in the case, I am just seeking parity,” Jethmalani said.
 
 The bench, however, refused Gopal’s plea and asked him to surrender to complete his sentence. It also dismissed the plea of Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy seeking modification of its order by which Sushil Ansal was let off with the sentence already undergone in view of his old age.
 
 The association contended that Sushil was hale and hearty and there was no evidence that he was suffering from age related problems and urged the court to direct him to surrender to finish the remainder of his one-year sentence.
 
 Gopal and Sushil were let off last year by the SC with the sentence already undergone by them as adequate punishment provided that each paid Rs 30 crore in fine. However, on review petitions filed by the association led by Neelam Krishnamoorthy and the CBI, the SC on February 9 upheld Sushil’s sentence but asked Gopal to undergo his full one-year prison term.
