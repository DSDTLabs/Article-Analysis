Twenty three-year-old  , who realised his dream of becoming a police officer like his father   after securing 624th rank in the   exam, has revealed that he is a die-hard fan of controversial filmmaker   and that he apes the filmmaker’s personality. 

 “I can’t express in words how much I follow him. I’m such a big fan of him that if he puts up a video on the Internet, a night before my exam, I cannot write the exam without watching it,” Akshay shared. 
 Akshay, who cracked the extremely competitive exam in his first attempt, says that he was drawn towards RGV because he found logic in his words. 
 
 “He taught me the importance of reasoning and logic and not to take anything or anybody by face value. I learnt from him that society is just a collection of people and thoughts. If 10 people say something, RGV says something completely different and yet, there is logic in his words. I have been influenced by him so much that my personality has changed after following him. Without him, I don’t have a life,” he added.
 Reacting to this, Ram Gopal Varma took to his social media to share that he also inspires   toppers and not just “criminals”.
 
 “For all those who thought i inspire only criminals and perverts take a listen to what this Civil Topper is saying ..The irony is that I was a terrible student and failed in Civil engineering twice but proud about it (sic),” the filmmaker tweeted. RGV also added that he would like to meet Akshay and speak to him about education.
