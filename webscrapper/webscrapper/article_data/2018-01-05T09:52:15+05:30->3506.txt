JAMSHEDPUR: As the Steel City gets ready for another   encounter, the expectations of a   fan have changed. A flurry of goals is not what could be on display at   on Friday. Having played seven matches in their first campaign in the league, the Steve Coppell-coached side have revealed themselves as a side that is stingy in conceding with more tactical acumen in defending than going all out for goals.

 Having let in just two goals so far, Jamshedpur will be facing a Mumbai City team that has hammered 11 goals in their eight games. It is expected to be a tactical battle between coaches Coppell and  . While   has kept five cleansheets, Mumbai City have conceded seven goals - five of these have been away from home. The two teams are separated by just four points, but Jamshedpur have played a game less. If they win, they will make significant ground towards the top four from their current sixth place.
