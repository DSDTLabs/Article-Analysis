GUWAHATI:   Indian citizen suspecting that he could be a sleeper agent of   

 Alamgir Hussain, the suspect, came under police scanner after he bought properties worth crores at Badarpur in Karimganj district. He visited Singapore frequently on a Bangladeshi passport between 2001 and 2013. 
 
 "We have taken him into seven-day custody. We have doubts on his source of income going by the wealth he has amassed within a short period of time. He could be a member of some Islamic radical group. We will get all the facts only after a thorough investigation," said SP (Karimaganj) PR Kar. 
 
 The doubts of police are based on Hussain's illegal entry into Bangladesh in 1998 without any passport. "He obtained a Bangladeshi passport there and went to Singapore in 2001. He came to India on a tourist visa in December, 2008 and got married. He returned to Bangladesh after 20 days," said Kar. 
 
 Police said Alamgir visited Singapore from Bangladesh on a Bangladeshi passport till 2013 when he decided to come back to his home town Badarpur. "He returned in 2013. But this time, he did not travel legally on his Bangladeshi passport because he would have to come on a tourist visa and return to Bangladesh again. He choose the illegal way to enter India," the SP said.
 
 Alamgir would have gone unnoticed had he not gone on a property-buying spree in the last four years. Police said he built a two-storey building and also purchased land. When police asked him about his source of money, he said he used to work as a daily wager at a construction company in Singapore and was getting $2 a day. 
 
 Police are yet to find his Bangladeshi passport.
