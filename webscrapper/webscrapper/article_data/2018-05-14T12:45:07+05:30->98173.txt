CHANDIGARH: Haryana minister O P   said on Sunday that the ‘vyayamshalas (gymnasiums)’ being opened across the state by the Khattar government were common places for children, young and old, where yoga could be practised.

 “These can also be utilized for public interest by social or youth organisations. We have no objection if the Congress party too wants to make use of these vyayamshalas,” Dhankar said, responding to the opposition party’s charge that there was a plan to use vyayamshalas and public parks for holding RSS shakhas.
 
 The minister’s remarks come at a time when Haryana is in midst of a row over the use of public places after right-wing organisations in Gurgaon objected to people performing namaz in the open. Meanwhile, conceding to the demand of farmers of the state, the Haryana government has asked the central government to allow procurement of mustard crop over and above the 25% limit. Dhankar said the decision had been taken to ensure that the produce of farmers in the state is procured properly.
 
 He took a dig at former CM Bhupinder Hooda for his rath yatra and INLD leader   for his remark on CM Manohar Lal Khattar’s foreign visit. “So far as Hooda is concerned, his rath got dysfunctional after the first leg. Let’s see whether he and his supporters have been able to get the rath repaired,” said Dhankar. “And, let Dushyant ask his party to come out with white paper on the foreign visits of the CM during the INLD regime,” he added.
