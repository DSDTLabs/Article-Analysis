LUCKNOW: When the new session of   starts on Monday, freshers are likely to be greeted by mosquito breeding on the campus. In a reality check on Friday, TOI found garbage heaps and stagnant water in hostels and teachers' residences besides at other spots.

 Last year, campus resident Prof Pankaj Mathur lost his father-in-law to dengue. All members of Prof Dinesh Kumar's family, which resides on the campus, suffered from dengue last year.
 
 "Just two days ago,   wrote to the vice chancellor for anti-larvae spray and garbage removal from the campus and residential areas," said Prof Dinesh Kumar from the education department. The condition of student hostels is worse. A huge pile of garbage is dumped near Acharya Narendra Dev hostel, while near Golden Jubilee hostel, a leaking water tank has led to logging.
 
 “Last year, there were six dengue cases in our hostel. We are living in fear this year,” said Ashish Saxena, a hostel resident. “Instructions for anti-larvae spray have been given. The head of every department has been directed to contribute to the cleaning drive every Saturday through 'shramdaan'," said vice chancellor SP Singh.
