CHENNAI: The Dravida Kazhagam, which professes atheism and rationalism, has given an ultimatum to Kanchi Sankara Mutt junior acharya   asking him to apologise for his failure to stand up when “Tamil Thai Vazhthu” (invocation to Tamil mother) was played during a book release function in Chennai on Tuesday.

 DK leader K Veeramani on Friday said the junior pontiff should apologise on or before February 3. "If the acharya refuses to apologise, DK cadre will stage protest in front of the Sankara Mutt in Kancheepuram as well as in front of its branches across  ," said Veeramani in a statement.
 
 The book release function was organised by BJP leader H Raja. When the Tamil anthem was played, Governor Banwarilal Purohit and other dignitaries stood up. But the junior seer remained seated.
