PUNE: The city   have taken their crackdown on   to the next level.

 Since Thursday, the police have sent more than   through text messages — along with links to photographic proof — to rule violators.
 
 The violations include to non-adherence to the zebra crossing rule, triple-riding, not using helmets and flouting the seat belt norm, using fancy number plates, and parking vehicles illegally, among others. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Praveen Mundhe told TOI, “These offenders, after receiving the e-challan text, are required to pay the fine at the concerned traffic division or at the nearest traffic division. S/he can also pay the fine online. Each day, we receive fines from 8-10 such offenders. About 35 people have paid the fine online or in person.”
 
 The 700-odd motorists were caught violating rules on the CCTV cameras installed at different spots in the city. For the purpose of sending e-challans, the traffic department has built a database of more than 7 lakh vehicle users in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. The list is constantly being updated. 
 
 Two years ago, the state home department had installed 1,230 CCTV cameras at different chowks and roads in the city. These cameras provide live feed to the city police control room. The same feed is now being shared with the traffic police control room as a part of the exercise to curb traffic violations, and also to take action against the violators.
 
 The cops, on witnessing any traffic violation, take a screengrab of the incident as photographic evidence. These photographs are saved online, and text messages are generated and sent to the cell phone number of the violator, along with the e-challan.
 
 Mundhe said about 15 days ago, the city police introduced swipe machines (point of sale machines) to collect fines. “However, if these traffic offenders want to pay the fine in cash, it will be accepted at the traffic police divisions,” he said.
