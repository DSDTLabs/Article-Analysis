PUNE: A 75-year-old man, who was undergoing treatment for   after giving up liquor, stabbed a medical practitioner with a knife at a private hospital off   on Monday over “inflated bill amount”. 

 The doctor, Santosh Awari, sustained injuries to his stomach and hand during the attack. He has preferred not to press charges in terms of an FIR against the senior citizen on humanitarian grounds, police said.
 
 A prima facie probe revealed that the elderly   was infuriated over the medical bill, which he felt was inflated by the doctor and the hospital authorities, police added. 
 
 The incident occurred at the Sinhagad Speciality Hospital at Nanded Phata when Santosh Awari was visiting various wards to check on patients. “The elderly man had got himself admitted four days ago as he was not feeling well after giving up his liquor and was constantly shivering. He had since recovered and was feeling better,” Awari told TOI.
 
 When Awari approached the elderly patient, he pulled out a knife from under his pillow and attacked the medical practitioner. “Awari sustained minor injuries as he managed to move away from the belligerent patient, who also attempted to chase him. The patient’s relatives managed to hold him back. He then slapped his two women relatives,” police said. 
 
 The doctor left the ward and went to his office thereafter. Later the patient’s relatives informed the hospital authorities that he was under the impression that the hospital had escalated his bill amount and were planning to keep him in the hospital for more days. To this, the authorities informed them that the patient was not given discharge so there was no question of processing the bill.
 
 Sinhagad Road practitioners’ association’s secretary Sangeeta Waghomode and Sinhagad Road medical forum’s coordinator   condemned the incident.
