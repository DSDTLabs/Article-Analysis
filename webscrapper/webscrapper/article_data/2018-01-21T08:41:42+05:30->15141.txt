BAREILLY: The Army and police are looking into the possibility of a spy network being active in the region since   belonging to the armed forces were seized from a photocopy shop in the   area here. Officials said on Friday evening, a police team accompanied by officials from the   (LIU) raided Yaraince Traders and found a bundle of classified documents. 

 Police are trying to look for the two youths who brought these papers to the shop for photocopying.
 
 "It is early to draw conclusion. We need to know how they got these documents. The papers in their possession had layouts and details of our training centers here," an officer of colonel rank said.
 
 Police and Army officials have also been checking   footage from the shop to gather clues. "All our units have photocopy facility. It is hard to believe that one of our men is involved," the Army officer said.
 
 Meanwhile, Cantonment police station SHO Vijay Pal Singh said, "The shop owner has told us that the youngsters were wearing tracksuits. The documents have been handed over to the army. We have also seized a laptop from the shop. A formal complaint into the case hasn't been registered yet." 
 
 When TOI visited Yaraince Traders, its owner   said, "Since they were carrying a bundle of documents, I asked them to come next morning. After hesitating for a bit, they agreed and left the shop."
