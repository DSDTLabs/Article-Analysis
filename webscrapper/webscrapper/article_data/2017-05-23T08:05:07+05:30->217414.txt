THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   termed corporation’s decision to pay operation and maintenance (O&M) charges to a contractor for cleaning of debris accumulated in Pazhavanagadi canal ‘fraudulent’ and has demanded investigation into the issue.

 The corporation awarded work related to the cleaning of Pazhanvangadi canal to one A Nizamudeen of Thoppil Constructions India Limited for Rs 9.37 crore in June 2012. The work also included installation of stainless steel bar screens at a cost of Rs 28 lakh at selected locations across the drain to arrest debris.
 
 As per terms of O&M, the contractors has to clean screens fixed across Pazhavangadi canal two times a day in non-monsoon period and three times a day in monsoon period for Rs 44 lakh. The contractor was also responsible for removing silt from the canal.
 
 However, in January 2015, project director of   decided to omit the scheme for providing silt pit and bar screens as they felt that chances for flooding would be more if the debris clogged the screens.
 
 The CAG found that corporation additionally paid Rs 6.09 lakh as O&M charges for cleaning of debris in bar screens for around 203 days, as claimed by the contractor. The CAG has noted that payment of O&M charges by corporation towards cleaning of bar screens, which were not installed, was ‘fraudulent and merits investigation’.
 
 In a reply to CAG, the corporation replied that temporary bar screens were installed at three places and the claim was related to cleaning of these. The corporation also stated that screens were removed due to public protest.
 
 However, CAG was not satisfied with the reply, as corporation was not able to submit work order or proof of incurring expenditure for installing the temporary bar screens for scrutiny. “Physical verification conducted by audit party proved that no bar screens were installed and hence the reply was not tenable in the absence of any evidence to show that the screens had been installed,” the CAG report said.
