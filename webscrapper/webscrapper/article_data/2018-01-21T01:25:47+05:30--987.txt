NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress   Ajay Maken on Saturday claimed that the   (EC) has delayed recommending the disqualification of 20 Aam Aadmi Party MLAs in the ‘office of profit’ issue to the President, which has only helped the latter in getting its members nominated for Rajya Sabha.

 “By delaying the disqualification by three weeks, the EC helped AAP. Had the recommendation made by EC had come three weeks earlier, it would have been before the Rajya Sabha election and these 20 MLAs would not have been able to vote and nominate Rajya Sabha candidates,” Maken said. “The Rajya Sabha elections were declared on December 22 and on January 19 the EC recommended the disqualification of these 20 MLAs. There is no justification for this delay.”
 
 “There is a tacit understating between BJP and AAP, which is why EC has delayed the recommendation,” he claimed.
 
 The Congress functionary also said that it is evident in documents in his possession that parliamentary secretaries were allowed to use government transport for official purposes and office space in the Minister’s office, apart from rooms in the Vidhan Sabha secretariat.
 
 Maken said Congress leader Sonia Gandhi was re-elected after facing questions of holding an  . “Sonia Gandhi had taken the high moral ground and got re-elected. There can not be different rules for different parties,” he said.
