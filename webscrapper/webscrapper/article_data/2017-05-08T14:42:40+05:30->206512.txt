CHENNAI: With   spiralling upward earlier this year than usual, police have pulled their trustworthy sola topees out of their lockers: When the summer sun threatens to wilt everything under it, they know they can rely on headgear that has proved its worth for more than 170 years. 

 The Chennai city traffic police have made available 2,500 new helmets of the type to replace damaged helmets and those that previous summers wore out.
 
 Summer is a stressful time, especially for  , who have to stand for long hours under the sun and battle   as they control traffic.
 
 Manufacturers use coir pith with thermocol padding and pores for ventilation, designed to reduce sweating, to make the wide-rimmed sola topees.
 
 When the British introduced them in India in the 1840s and started using them widely across the subcontinent by 1660, they made them of different material, but the product served its purpose just as well.
 
 The British-made sola topee, also known as pith helmet and safari helmet, derived its name from the 'shola'/'sola' swamp plant that its first manufacturers used.
 
 The helmets may now just be a useful remnant from the days of the Raj but have, for generations, stood out for their utility. Little wonder that various police forces across the country still depend on them when the dog days come around.
 
 The helmet does not hinder visibility and the projecting rim serves as a sunshade, a police officer said.
 
 Traffic policemen in Chennai control vehicular flow for four hours each in the morning and evening every day.
 
 "The scorching sun drains us completely,"   sub-inspector   said. "We use similar helmets every year because they are very helpful. Out seniors have asked us to exchange old ones for new."
