 Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said the BJP could criticise   for speaking the truth about contemporary India at  , but the criticism from the UN body was a first of sorts.

 “India has never had to face this ignominy and international humiliation. You can rail against the UNHRC but the fact is that it is an inter-governmental body,” he said.
 
 Questioning the BJP regime’s policy on refugees from  , Tewari said, “The government’s stand on Rohingyas is totally contrary to India’s traditions where we have welcomed the persecuted from any part of our neighbourhood.”
