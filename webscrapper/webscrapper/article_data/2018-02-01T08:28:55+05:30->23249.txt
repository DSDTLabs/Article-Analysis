AHMEDABAD: It was February 1, exactly 101 years ago when Mahatma Gandhi came to Ahmedabad to make one of his biggest decisions of establishing a Satyagraha ashram in Ahmedabad that would change the course of history.

 It was Sir  , a large hearted philanthropist who had assured the Mahatma all help and was even the first to organise a felicitation ceremony in the walled city to welcome Bapu to Ahmedabad. Today, the 84-year-old statue dedicated to the same man, ironically on February 1, stands abused and vandalised, with the nose chopped off, fingers cut and his feet hammered off.
 
 Baronet’s statue at Bhadra plaza, was inaugurated by Bapu himself on September 21, 1933. After enduring the weather for decades, the marble statue developed cracks. A pained family member and descendant of the Baronet family, Achyut Baronet, registered an FIR with the Karanj police station against unknown miscreants who had vandalised the statue.
 
 “I had expressed my concerns for the statue to the authorities and the architect when the Bhadra Plaza revitalisation project was on. I had told them how the statue will be vandalised if the protective railings are removed. This proved true,” says Baronet.
 
 On November 7 last year, TOI had warned of miscreants vandalising the statue after the protective railing around it was removed during the Bhadra Plaza revitalisation project. This exposed the marble statue to all elements. “Our family is thinking of protecting monument and carrying out the restoration work. One of my well-wishers even suggested of installing   cameras,” says Baronet.
