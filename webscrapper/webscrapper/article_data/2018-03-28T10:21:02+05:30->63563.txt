LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief   said in the   on Tuesday that he would rely on the "age and experience" of   chief   to defeat   in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 

 Akhilesh also dared BJP to try and break the BSP-SP alliance, saying the saffron party wouldn't come back to power in 2019. 
 
 His statement comes two days after Mayawati said that Akhilesh was "politically inexperienced" to have relied on Independent MLA   that led to the BSP candidate's defeat in Rajya Sabha elections. 
 
 "After BJP managed to defeat us in the RS elections, it tried very hard to sow seeds of discord between SP and BSP. But I will rely on experience. I have a big heart and if I get an opportunity, I will give whatever is required to be given," Akhilesh said, referring to Mayawati's remarks. He accused BJP of making attempts to harass political rivals.
