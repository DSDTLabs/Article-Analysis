HYDERABAD: As many as 10,000 women across India die from burn injuries and many more face severe deformities and disfigurement leading to full or partial disability. Many women also succumb due to inadequate and unresponsive support services. To understand the magnitude of the problems being faced by   in the state, the British Deputy High Commission, Chennai, is facilitating a state-level round table meet on February 8 at  , Secunderabad. 

 "We have noticed that the death rate among women is 20% higher than men succumbing to burns," said B Girija, an activist. These are only conservative estimates, she added. The meeting will look into the need for a more holistic support system for women burn survivors in Telangana.
 
 Activists said a policy must be framed to extend support to burn victims. Earlier, help has been provided to victims to get multiple surgeries under the Aarogyasri scheme. The meeting will focus on figuring out ways for the state to access funds under the National Program for the Prevention of Burn Injuries.
 
 The International Foundation for Crime Prevention & Victim Care (PCVC), a Chennai-based non-profit organization, will be the coordinator of the event. Doctors (plastic surgeons, forensic experts and psychiatrists), officials from the police, legal services authority and lawyers, and representatives from several civil society women's organisations will participate in the day-long meeting.
