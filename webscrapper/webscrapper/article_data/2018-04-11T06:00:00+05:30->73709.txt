 Ramesh and Amulya R, sitting in the southeast pavilion, broke into loud cheers as Team Hyderabad’s openers —   and   — walked out to begin the chase. “This chase is going to be a cake walk if they don’t do anything silly,” cautioned Ramesh as Saha took guard for the first delivery.

I just hope they keep it going as this is a really long tournament and anything can happen,” said 58-year-old Murali Rao, a loyal Orange soldier.
