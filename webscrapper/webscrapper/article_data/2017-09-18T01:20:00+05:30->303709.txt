Lucknow: Below normal rainfall this year is threatening the   crop in most parts of the state in the   season. Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi met on Saturday authorities of the energy and   departments and directed them to ensure optimum power supply and to arrange for the necessary level of water to flow into paddy fields. 

 The chief minister was informed that Agra, Hathras, Amethi, Ghaziabad and Bulandshar districts received highly deficient rains, less than 15% , while in the entire Bundelkhand region comprising Jhansi, Lalitpur and 16 other districts, rains were below 40%. 20 other districts of the region have also received deficient rains. In 48 districts comprising more than 50% of the stateâ€™s geographical area, rain was deficient this year and if the dry and humid spell continues for the remaining days of September, there may be a crisis for farmers, as majority of them are depending on rains for their paddy crop.
 
 During the review meeting, the chief minister was presented a report by the irrigation department on its efforts to bolster flow of water into the agriculture fields, particularly for paddy and other   of the Kharif season. State energy minister Shrikant Sharma said rise in demand for electricity all over the state was primarily because of deficient rains.
 
 Principal secretary irrigation Suresh Chandra told TOI he had issued necessary directions for optimum supply of water to canals for irrigation and he added that he had asked electricity department officials to ensure regular and adequate power supply to run tube wells. Agriculture director Soraj Singh said amid deficient rains in Bundelkhand, seeds and other aids to farmers are being supplied for the   season. 
 
 Paddy is sown in 59 lakh hectares agriculture land. Last year, rice production was 143 lakh metric tonnes as rains were normal but this time, with below average rain, not only paddy, most Rabi crops, mainly wheat will suffer because of lack of the requisite moisture level.
