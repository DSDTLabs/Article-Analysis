According to Khambatta’s complaint, she had purchased a moisturizing face cream, Happyderm, from   in 2007. When she applied the cream to her hands and lips, blisters broke out and her skin turned red.

She said when she called the store, she was offered a compensation of Rs 25,000, which she declined. She later sent a legal notice to the store as well as to L’Oréal. When the cosmetics company did not respond, she approached the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (rural) and demanded a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for her troubles, including the cancellation of her Singapore trip and medical treatment. Her claims were contested by the store owner and L’Oréal. They also disputed Khambatta’s claim that she was offered Rs 25,000 as compensation. They told the court that the cream’s samples conformed with standards when they were tested at a laboratory in  . The consumer forum rejected her complaint on March 31, 2010. 
 
 Dissatisfied with the order, Khambatta challenged it before the  , contending that the lower court had not taken into account the prescription of the skin specialist she had consulted. After Khambatta’s lawyer passed away, she did not follow the matter up with another lawyer. The commission upheld the forum’s verdict and rejected her appeal last week on the grounds that the bill that she had produced did not bear her name, no date was mentioned on it, and that there was no proof of the cancellation of her Singapore trip.
