NOIDA: Anurag Garg and Sandesh Verma, who are accused of orchestrating a Rs 260-crore   through their Noida-based company  , have got   from the Allahabad high court. 

 Granting bail to the Webwork directors, the court observed that Noida police had delayed filing of the charge sheet and also put an ante-date (the charge sheet was dated April 16 but was filed on May 15). It said such a charge sheet was not valid in the eyes of law and the accused could not be held on the basis of it. 
 
 Garg and Verma have, however, been asked to report to the court every week during the pendency of the trial. 
 
 The court had in May ordered the   to take over the probe. The order was passed by Justice Amar Singh Chauhan on June 29. Amit Kishore Jain, a resident of  , had filed a complaint against Garg and Verma on February 12 at Sector 20 police station in Noida, alleging the duo were running a digital Ponzi scheme and cheating scores of investors in the name of high returns. 
 
 Jain claimed he had invested Rs 3.5 lakh and subscribed to six IDs in the company, which had suddenly stopped payments. Barely a week before this, Anubhav Mittal’s Social Trade, a Ponzi fraud whose scale is suspected to be many times more than Webwork, was busted in Noida. 
 
 Following Jain’s complaint and the unraveling of Social Trade, Garg and Verma shut down Webwork, which had its office in Sector 2, and went incommunicado for a few days. On February 17, they surfaced for a meeting with the police at the Noida SSP’s office where they were arrested. 
 
 But Noida police, in the charge sheet, stated the two directors were arrested on a tip-off by an informer from Pari Chowk. 
 
 Jain alleged Noida police delayed the investigation and, in the end, hurriedly filed a 6,000-page charge sheet a on May 17, a day before the deadline.
 
 Manish Tiwary and Sunil Vashisth, counsel for Noida police, argued before the court that with the CBI taking over the case, police investigations had become ‘functus officio’ (mandate had expired). But Justice Chauhan observed it is illegal to file ante-dated charge sheet. The court ruled that the accused were being illegally detained on the basis of a charge sheet that is null in the eyes of law.
 
 When TOI asked Anil Kumar Shahi, SHO of Sector 20 police station, about the charge sheet, he said he was on leave and not aware of the bail order.
