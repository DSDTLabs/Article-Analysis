MEERUT: An eight-year-old boy was allegedly kept in police lock-up for five days in Meerut as angry cops on the lookout for elder male members of his family, all of whom were charged with  , couldn't find them. Fearing action, the boy's uncles and father are still on the run. 

  On Friday, when local media got hold of the story - the boy's mother Channo Begum, 43, had been wailing outside the  , about 15 km away from Meerut city, for days now - they finally let him go. 
 
 Rajesh Kumar, SP (rural), told TOI, "The matter has been brought to my knowledge. I spoke to the in-charge of Kharkhoda police station, who denied the allegations. But we are investigating the matter." 
 
  This comes even as two minor sisters, one 12 and another 16, have been in jail in Muzaffarnagar battling cow slaughter charges for more than a month now. Nine people, including their mother, were arrested on December 29 for alleged slaughter of cows. The main accused,  , the girls' father, is still at-large. The two girls were shown as adults in court. 
 
  Begum told TOI on Friday that on January 27 police had raided the jungles of Uldhan village following a tip-off that a cow was being slaughtered. She said cops claimed that 3 quintals of the meat was recovered. As the men, Babua Ahmad, Mohd Kafil and Ayub Ahmad - all related to her - ran away, cops from the Kharkhoda police station picked up her son and took him to the thana. 
 
 Pramod Kumar, station officer, Kharkhoda police station, refuted the charges. He said, "We never detained any boy. The reality is that ever since the village was raided and cow slaughterers fled the scene while firing in the air, we have been continuously on our toes to nab them. Consequently, these village women along with their kids have been coming to the station every day, telling us that their men are innocent. It is an everyday affair for them. Now it is being portrayed as if we have detained one of the boys, which is not true."
