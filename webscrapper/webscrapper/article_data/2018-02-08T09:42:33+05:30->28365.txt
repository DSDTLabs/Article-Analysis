LUDHIANA: Faced by strong opposition from private schools affiliated to it,   announced on Wednesday that government schools will not necessarily be allotted as examination centres for Class X and XII students of private schools.

 The decision came two days after private schools had gone on strike to oppose the PSEB’s move to have government schools as examination centres for private ones and vice-versa. Before this, students sat for exams at their own schools.
 
 The board released a press release in the evening, stating that the examination centre will be within 3km of a student’s school and not necessarily a government one. PSEB   (RASA) had raised the issue with   education secretary   on Tuesday.
 
 The education secretary said there would be no rollback of the decision on discontinuing with “self centres”. “However, we will ensure all examination centres are within 3km of each school. It will be no compulsory to have centres of private schools in government ones,” he said.
 
 In the protest strike on Monday, nearly 450 private schools affiliated to the board remained closed. The logjam between private schools and the   had also started worrying students. Private schools had been opposing the move, saying that government schools lacked facilities, especially benches and their students would be forced to sit on the floor. The school had also said that government ones lacked clean drinking water and washrooms. 
 
 The secretary said the board had decided to allow practical exams of students in their own schools. When contacted, RASA district secretary   said they were glad with the decision. “It will be of benefit to the students,” he said. 
 
 The education secretary added that all schools promoting cheating would face disaffiliation. “We will not allow students to indulge in unfair means in any way,” he said.
