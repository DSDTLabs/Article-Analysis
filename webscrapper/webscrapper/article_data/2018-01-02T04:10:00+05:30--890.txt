Vadodara: Even as the mercury levels are expected to dip in coming days Barodians will have smooth ride at junctions which witness heavy traffic in the morning hours. Thanks to the initiative of traffic branch of city police to give winter jackets to traffic cops, the busy roads will be manned since 8 am. The city police provided winter jackets to hundreds of traffic cops last week so that they can get relief from winter chills during the morning and late evening hours. Senior police officials said that this will help them to curb traffic jams in areas like Makarpura, Chhani, Gorwa among others where heavy traffic is witnessed during the morning hours as many industries are located there. “Due to industries the staff buses and other heavy vehicles move around in these areas leading to traffic jams, but if our men will be present there the situation will be better,” the police official said. A traffic constable said that earlier they used to go little late at traffic junctions since it would be very cold even at 8 am, but now the new jackets help them brave cold winds. Another cop who was deployed at Kalaghoda on New Year’s eve said that he could manage traffic even beyond midnight since he had the new jacket. “The other cops already have their jackets so they are able to patrol even in the wee hours, but the new jackets for traffic cops will be like their new uniform and they will be able to manage traffic from early morning till late night,” said K G Bhati, joint commissioner of police.
