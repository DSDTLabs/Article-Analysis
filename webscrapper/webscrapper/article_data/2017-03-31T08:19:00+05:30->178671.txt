THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even by mediocre standards of fund expenditure in the past this financial year would go down as the toughest for the local bodies in the state. A comparison of the levels of plan fund utilization in the past three fiscals for the month of March shows that this year recorded the lowest percentage.

 As on March 29, the percentage of fund utilization in local bodies is 52.7%, while in 2015-16 and 2014-15, the utilization percentage for the month recorded 73.6% and 68.21% respectively. The state government had released Rs 5,724.89 crore for local bodies of which only Rs 3045.43 could be spent. A total of 95,569 projects have incurred expenditure as on March 30.
 
 Of the six civic corporations, only one civic body ­   ­ could manage above 50% as on March 30. Kollam and Kochi recorded 43.39 and 43.10 percentage respectively. All the remaining three corporations, Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode are below 40%. Among district panchayats, Palakkad, Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram have earned some respect recording 68.3%, 66.96% and 64.53% respectively .

Till date, the local bodies have managed only 20.71% of World Bank funds. The local self-government officials and civic body heads attribute poor plan fund utilization mainly to code of conduct during assembly elections and effects of demonetization. “The implementation was completely stuck for almost three months when the code of conduct was in effect. When the local bodies recovered from that phase, demonetization hit us and delay in transaction of bills at treasury hindered progress of works,'' said an official with the  . Lack of adequate staff in some local bodies is also cited as a reason for poor fund utilization. The officials also said that there was a natural delay on account of the transition to Price software for preparing work estimates as there was confusion among contractors.
 
 “There was opposition from contractors regarding technical difficulties in switching over to Price software. It cost us time to resolve disputes. Many local bodies started preparing plans for this fiscal after May , 2016, and it was only by September, 2016, that the projects were approved,'' officials said.
