CALANGUTE: All   allotted by the tourism department will have to be dismantled by the end of the tourism season in early June, said deputy speaker and Calangute MLA  . 

 The recent notification of an amendment to the CRZ notification of 2011 permitting the owners of seasonal, temporary structures in the CRZ 500m zone to retain their structures has created confusion amongst a section of beach shack owners in  , with some of them assuming that the notification also allows them to retain their structures on the beach. 
 
 The Candolim-Calangute beach stretch has more than half of all the beach shacks in Goa.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Lobo said that the notification only applies to private shacks and ‘coco-huts’ in private properties. “This notification does not apply to beach shacks on the public beach who have been given licences by the tourism department. It only applies to private shacks and coco-huts in private properties. No beach shack can be kept on the beach during the monsoon,” he said.
 
 Most shack owners are also of the view that it is not possible to keep the beach shacks on the beach as most of the Candolim-Calangute beach stretch gets eroded during the monsoon, and the water level rises tremendously beyond the line where shacks are erected. However, some sections of the beach, such as at the Calangute beach main entrance are not much affected by the seasonal erosion. With some media reports claiming that beach shacks are allowed to be retained on the beach, some of the shack owners in these areas are contemplating retaining their shacks where they are, even though the beach shack license given by the tourism department clearly states that they are to be dismantled at the end of the season.
