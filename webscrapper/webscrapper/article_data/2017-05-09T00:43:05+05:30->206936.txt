His movie '  2' enjoys a massive fan following even today, but filmmaker   says he will not come up with a third part without the right script. 

 'Aashiqui 2', directed by Suri, had   and   in lead roles. There were reports that Bhatts were gearing up for a third part with   and Alia.
 
 Mohit, who is currently busy promoting 'Half Girlfriend' told PTI, "It's a loved franchise but it should come back for the right reason, which is the script. I would've made 'Aashiqui 2' even if it would've been called 'RJ ki ek love story'. I wanted to make the film badly and tell the story. 
 
 "You shouldn't make a film because you want to capitalise on a title. You can get the film to the audience but you can't make them like it. I can lose everything I built with 'Aashiqui 2' by making a bad 'Aashiqui 3'," he adds. 
 
 'Half Girlfriend' is scheduled to release on May 19.
