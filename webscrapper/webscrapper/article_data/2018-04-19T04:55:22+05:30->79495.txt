 In a statement, UIDAI also clarified that media reports quoting UIDAI’s counsel Rakesh Dwivedi's argument in the   that   is trying to fail Aadhaar were not correct. “Dwivedi had submitted that as far as Google, Facebook and Twitter are concerned, they cannot be compared with Aadhaar due to the nature of information being different and also due to the difference in the nature of algorithms being used,” it said.
