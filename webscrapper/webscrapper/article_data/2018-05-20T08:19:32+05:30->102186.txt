MANGALURU: To facilitate education of poor students in rural areas,   has opened a constituent college in  . The campus will start functioning from this academic year. The campus has come up on a sprawling 27-acre land and will offer BA, B.com and   courses from June.

 Currently Mangalore University has four constituent colleges - Field Marshal K M Cariappa College, Madikeri, University College, Mangaluru, University Evening College in Mangaluru and University First Grade College, Mangalagangotri.
 
 “As per our plans, the Nellyadi campus will start functioning from a temporary building and we will improvise year by year depending on grants from government,” MU registrar   told STOI.
 
 Explaining why the university decided to setup a campus in Nellyadi, one of the backward areas in the district, Khan said that there is no government college in a 15km radius around the campus. “Students have to depend on private colleges and local residents demanded an education institution run by government. Local leaders and panchayat members from here convinced government to grant land and then chief minister Siddaramaiah laid the foundation on January 7,” he added.
 
 Khan said more courses will be added in the coming years based on demand. Currently the college will function from   premises.
 
 The college will be headed by a senior staff from Mangalagangothri campus and other staff will be recruited as guest faculties. MU will also depute staff from   campus on time to time for teaching purposes.
 
 Udupi campus work on snail’s pace
 
 Mangalore University’s plan to add another constituent college at the Government First Grade College, Thenkanidiyoor in Udupi is still under process. Though it was planned three years ago, there has been no positive development, said a source from MU. Syndicate members had recently given the green signal to consider the Udupi college as a constituent college. Sources add that it is delayed due to financial crunch.
