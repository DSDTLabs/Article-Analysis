BHOPAL: Summer is in and Bhopalis are packing their bags and looking for the perfect retreat. While Thailand, Singapore and   were preferred till last year, this time it’s Europe.

 Richa Singh Bhadoriya, location head of a well-known travel agency said, “This year the trend has shifted to European countries from ASEAN locations. But, what is surprising is that the tourists are not opting for the most frequented locations and are choosing to explore Milan, Venice, Barcelona, Croatia and Prague.”
 
 Speaking about domestic tourism trends Richa said, “Sikkim is the hot-cake for tourists who wish to explore India along with other destinations of North-East. The culture and hospitality of locals allows tourists to have a good time. The delicacies of the region too are a crowd puller.” Kashmir and Himachal that used to be topdraws are not in demand with vacationers from the state capital. The drop in tourists to these location may be as significant as 40%, she said.
 
 “We went to Europe for summer vacations as we wanted to experience snowfall. Our wish was fulfilled in Paris and Switzerland. It was a great vacation and the Le Lido show at Champs-Élysées in Paris was wonderful,” said Kaushal Chaubey. Bollywood movies showcasing Croatia and Prague have played a major role in heightening interest in India.
 
 Vijay Saxena state secretary of consumer forum who visited five cities of Europe said, “I wanted to see the cities that were closer to nature. I enjoyed boat rides in Venice and visited the Chapel of the Holy Nail and it was a memorable experience.”
 
 Sagar Sharma, holiday consultant, of a Bhopal-based travel consultancy said, “Youth are attracted to the bohemian culture of Kasol and out-door camps of Leh-Ladakh. Outdoor camps and star-gazing in the mountains are also becoming a major trend among youngsters who like being called ‘explorers’ instead of tourists.”
