MUMBAI: The project cost of the entire 20-km monorail corridor has gone up by Rs 236 crore over the planned Rs 2,460 crore, and the system is not even running today for want of adequate stock of spare parts. “We are yet to finalise the date for commissioning of the corridor,” an MMRDA official said on Thursday. “We are trying to fulfil the recommendations of the safety commissioner on spare parts.”

  
  
 
 Though Phase 1 services were launched in February 2014, these were suspended on the 8.8-km corridor between Chembur and   after two coaches were gutted in a fire in November 2017. It was decided then that the entire system would be launched together as Phase 2 of the project was almost ready.
 
 The cost rise came to light in information obtained under the RTI Act by activist  . “The total estimated cost for the project was pegged at Rs 2,460 crore, which included Phase 1 and Phase 2. MMRDA has now said that the project cost increased by Rs 236 crore,” Galgali said. The project cost does not include tax expenses.
 
 The inspection of the system was completed by former commissioner of railway safety S   on March 28. His report asked the MMRDA to ensure adequate stock of spare parts for regular maintenance of the rakes.
 
 CM   announced in last year’s budget session that the full corridor would start in December 2017. Later, it was hoped that services would begin in February, but it was delayed again.
