KOLKATA:   Antara Das was worried that her   Santosh Kumar might continue to   her even at workplace. Unable to stop Kumar from stalking, she planned to use her kin's wedding - that was slated for January 22 - as her own, to mislead him said cops. 

 When Kumar called her in mid-November, she told him a friend had proposed her and she has already planned to marry him. At that time, Kumar had congratulated her. 
 
 According to police, the accused later found out that Antara had taken a leave in January to attend a wedding in Kolkata. This made the stalker believe that Antara was actually getting married. Now, the Pune police claims that ever since Kumar got to know about her leave, he had been planning to murder her. 
 
 Antara's father, Debananda Das, said, "She took this step believing that it might destroy any wrong notion Santosh had about her," said the officer. 
 
 Police said that since the accused had already said that he was not in Pune on the day of murder, his confession, which says that he got another person to commit the crime, could be true. "But nothing is certain yet. He might be misleading the investigators," said police sources.
