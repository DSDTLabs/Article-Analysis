CHENNAI: Opposition parties in   on Friday welcomed the   ordering a confidence vote in Karnataka on Saturday itself. The parties wanted the Centre to recall Karnataka governor   immediately.

 
 “The verdict given by the Supreme Court is seen as a big victory for democracy and the Constitution. The mistake by the Karnataka governor has become apparent,” DMK working president M K Stalin told reporters at the party headquarters Anna Arivalayam.
 
 “Vala should immediately resign or Prime Minister   or President   should remove him from the post,” Stalin said.
 
 The parties termed the governor decision to sworn in B S Yeddyurappa as hasty and against the Constitution. “The invitation to the BJP and also swearing in Yeddyurappa as chief minister was hasty and unconstitutional. It will lead to horse-trading,” said Stalin.
 
 PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss welcome the Supreme Court order as it will prevent horse trading of MLAs. “The Supreme Court asking the BJP to seek a trust vote immediately will prevent horse trading of MLAs. But the apex court must also have a watch on the trust vote as a repeat of 2008 must not happen,” said the former Union minister. Anbumani criticised the appointment of pro tem speaker who belongs to the BJP. “K   is a former speaker of the Karnataka assembly and is not the senior most MLA. The Supreme Court wanted only the senior-most MLA to be appointed as pro tem speaker,” said Anbumani.
