LUCKNOW/BAREILLY: The first list of   (SP) candidates which was released on Friday has most of the 38 names which were recommended by party patriarch Mulayam Singh to his son and UP CM  . These include  , who was ousted by Akhilesh as UP SP chief. He has been re-nominated from Jaswantnagar in Etawah. At least three nominees recommended by Mulayam were rejected by Akhilesh.

 The list of 208 candidates, released by Akhilesh, focusses on SP's tested Muslim-Yadav (MY) formula: 56 Muslims and 26 Yadavs figure in the list.
 
 Akhilesh's focus on Muslim candidates gains significance since Mulayam had said recently that there was a perception that UP CM was not pro-Muslim. SP, which had fielded 80 Muslim candidates in 2012 polls, plans to match the count of 97 Muslim candidates fielded by BSP this time. The party has also given tickets to 23 Thakurs and 11 Brahmins.
 
 However, Akhilesh has not given tickets to SP MLA from Bidhuna Ashish Yadav and Shivpal confidant and SP MLA from Etawah Raghuraj Shakiya. Both of them were recommended by Mulayam. Another recommendation set aside is that of Rakesh Verma from Ramnagar in Barabanki. He has been replaced by Akhilesh loyalist and minister Arvind Singh Gope. In all, 21 sitting MLAs did not make it to the list announced on Friday.
 
 SP MP Naresh Agrawal's son Nitin Agrawal has been fielded from Hardoi, while Azam Khan and his son Abdullah Azam will be SP candidates from Rampur Khas and Suar assembly seats in Rampur, respectively.
