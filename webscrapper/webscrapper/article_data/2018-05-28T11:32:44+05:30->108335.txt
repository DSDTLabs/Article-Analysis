SAN FRANCISCO: A major tobacco company is pumping millions of dollars into a campaign to persuade San Francisco voters to reject a ban on selling flavored tobacco products. It includes menthol cigarettes and vaping liquids with flavors like cotton candy, mango and cool cucumber.

 
 RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. has contributed nearly $12 million to the "No on Proposition E'' campaign, filling airwaves and mailboxes with ads urging voters to reject a ban on the June 5 ballot.
 
 Supporters have raised $2.8 million, including more than $2 million from former   Mayor  , in what they say is an effort to help stop another generation from getting hooked on nicotine.
 
 Small business owners are among those opposing the ban, which they say will hurt sales because people can still buy flavored "e-liquid'' and tobacco products online.
