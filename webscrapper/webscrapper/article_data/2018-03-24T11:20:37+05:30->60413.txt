GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat governmentâ€™s decision to enforce a temporary ban on new   permits on health grounds stems from the fact that the state witnessed a sharp 108% increase in such permits in two years. According to the records of the state home department, 1,922 health-based liquor permits were issued in 2015, which touched 2,841 in 2016 and 3,998 in 2017, a 108% rise compared to 2015.

 The data revealed that Surat has the highest number of health-based liquor permits followed by Ahmedabad and Rajkot. Porbandar registered almost 190% jump in health permits in two years. Dang has only five   holders.
 
 In two years, while the number of permit holders went down in Surat, Tapi, Bhavnagar, Narmada, Sabarkantha, Patan and Junagadh, it shot up in Porbandar, Kutch, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Vadodara, Valsad and Jamnagar districts.
