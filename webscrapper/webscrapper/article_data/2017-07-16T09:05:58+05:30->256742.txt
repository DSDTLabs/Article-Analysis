BENGALURU: After the back-to-back drought years, low storage in dams coupled with a rain deficit of 22% this year seem to have pushed Karnataka to the brink. The state government has pinned all its hopes of survival on a four-day rain spell, expected between July 19 and July 22, failing which it will turn to  .

 “We are expecting a good rainfall for four days next week. If it doesn’t rain, then we are faced with a drinking water crisis,” minister for minor irrigation and law   said. 
 
 According to the minister, he had held a series of meetings with municipalities and urban local bodies, wherein he was informed that the drinking water situation is reaching a critical stage across the state. “Forget farming, which will take a sizeable hit, we are certainly staring at an even bigger crisis — of drinking water,” he said. 
 
 Echoing  , KSDMC in-charge   said that the four days of monsoon will be critical for the state. “The current trend suggests that between July 19 and July 22, we are expecting rains in Karnataka. It is critical because water levels in most dams are currently in a dismal position,” he said.
 
 With water levels falling below 40% of the capacity, none of the 10 major dams in Karnataka have shown any signs of increase in their water levels ever since the monsoon has officially commenced this year.
 
 The situation in Cauvery basin reservoirs are in a much precarious situation with two major dams of Krishna Raj Sagara and Hemavathi recording just 13 and 17 per cent of their total live storage capacity.
 
 The only dam that has shown signs of improving water levels is Harangi, a small-sized dam. Water level in Harangi is at 41% of its capacity — that is a paltry 3.29tmc as on July 15.
 
 The situation in north Karnataka is no better. Almatti has just 40.28tmc water while Ghataprabha records 10.95tmc.
 
 Alarmed by the shortage in rainfall, the Karnataka government has decided to accelerate cloud seeding, and is aiming for its implementation by August first week. “What other option do we have? Majority of the minor irrigation tanks have gone dry and there is barely enough potable water. Cloud seeding is the best bet we have got,” Jayachandra said.
 
 Success of cloud seeding activity depends on several factors — from the take-off time of the plane to the experience of the pilot who should know where and when to release the catalyst to increase the chances of rains in catchment areas, an expert said.
