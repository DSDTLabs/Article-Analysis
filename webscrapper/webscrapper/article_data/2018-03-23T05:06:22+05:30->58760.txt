The state government will give directions to the police to take back cases filed against the protesting apprentices who paralysed railway traffic on Tuesday morning, said CM   on Thursday. 

 He said only those who pelted stones and had been identified in the CCTV footage would be treated differently and charges would be pressed against them. “If we release them then a different message will be sent, that people can do anything and they will be let off,” Fadnavis said.
 
 The issue was raised by leader of the opposition Radhakrishan Vikhe Patil, who said that the youths who agitated for an rise in the   quota in railway recruitment from 20% to 100% were not hardened criminals and should be let off to protect their future prospects. tnn
