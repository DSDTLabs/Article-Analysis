 Girish Bapat, parliamentary affairs minister, said the Bill to allot Mayor’s Bungalow for Bal Thackeray’s memorial will also be tabled in this session. Other Bills include the amendments to the land revenue code and revise penalties on illegal buildings by municipal corporations.
 
 “All these amendments to rules have already been approved by the state cabinet. These amendments will only be tabled as Bills for approval from both the Houses of the legislature,” said Bapat.
