HYDERABAD: The   president, N Uttam Kumar Reddy, on Saturday appealed to all opposition parties, NGOs, civil society organisations and other public forums to launch a mass agitation against the proposed amendments in the Panchayat Raj Act by the chief minister   Rao-led TRS government. 

 Uttam appealed to the elected members of all gram panchayats to pass a resolution on January 28 opposing the proposed amendments in the PR Act and seek direct elections to the post of the sarpanch. The   party would submit resolutions to governor ESL Narasimhan to take action, he said.
 
 Speaking at a round table conference here, Uttam said the TRS Government was bringing amendments in PR Act not to empower the local bodies but to strip them of their powers and funds. He said if the TRS Government is allowed to do what it is intending, then the local body institutions would face a situation which would be worse than it was in united Andhra Pradesh.
 
 Uttam rejected the proposal of the TRS government to hold indirect and party-less elections for Panchayat Raj institutions. He said that the sarpanch elections should be conducted through ballot papers. The TRS government had completely neglected the gram panchayats, mandal and zilla parishads and they were not given their due share of money in the 5 lakh crore allocated in the last four budgets. 
 
 The   chief alleged that the CM was crushing democracy at all levels. The entire government was run by a family while all sarpanches, ZPTCs and MPTCs have been reduced to mere figure heads. 
 
 TJAC chairman M Kodandaram said the weaker sections of society will lose out if an indirect election is conducted. "Earlier too the ruling TRS tried to become an extra-constitutional authority in villages. Now, it's time for all the opposition parties to oppose an indirect election and all issues in the proposed PR Act," he said.
