NEW DELHI: Taking the battle over   a step further, the Khadi and   ( ) has sought compensation from ethnic retailer   for selling non-khadi garments as khadi products in its stores.

 While KVIC sought payment from Fabindia for indulging in alleged “unfair practice”, sources told TOI that the government agency could have lost around Rs 100-200 crore business due to this. So far, KVIC has not quoted any compensation amount.
 
 “This is highly speculative, with no basis in fact. Fabindia has been sustaining artisanal livelihoods for the last 57 years. We would like to clarify that Fabindia sources handcrafted products, including fabric, from artisans across the country. We have been in conversation with KVIC on certification since 2015,” a Fabindia spokesperson told TOI.
 
 Under the law, khadi products can only be sold if they are sourced from approved units. When contacted, KVIC chairman V K Saxena refused to comment, saying this was a business matter.
 
 Sources said the agency responsible for promoting khadi and village industries sought compensation earlier this month, while rejecting Fabindia’s application for selling khadi products as the foreign investor-backed entity refused to accept the terms and conditions.
 
 Sources said despite KVIC’s warning in 2015, Fabindia was allegedly selling non-khadi products as khadi till January this year. Initially, there were negotiations between both the organisations to allow Fabindia to use the khadi trademark, something that has been granted to   and Arvind Mills.
