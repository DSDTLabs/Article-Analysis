NEW DELHI:   sources termed CAG’s complaint about non-cooperation from   regarding details of searches and seizures by I-T department during 2012-2016 as misleading and unnecessary.

 “We cannot provide them with definitive figures for the simple reason that searches and seizures are only the first step of a long process and cannot be the basis for a conclusive statement. A report based on searches and seizures is subject to verification by assessing officer whose determination can be challenged before Commissioner Appeals in the income tax department. 
 
 The assessee can move the   of the I-T department and, in case he fails there too, the high court and the  . We cannot tie ourselves to a definite figure before the federal auditor before the assessee has exhausted all options he is entitled to. Can a police officer predict the number of convictions his investigation can lead to?” said a central board of direct taxes (CBDT) officer.
 
 He further said that CAG’s approach has been both “reasonable and intriguing”. “They are familiar with our inability to give them definitive figures about the outcome of search and seizure operations, the fact that that this goes back a long time as also our stand that exchange of information will be faster once we start using the software-I-T Business Application which has been developed for the purpose,” said the source.
