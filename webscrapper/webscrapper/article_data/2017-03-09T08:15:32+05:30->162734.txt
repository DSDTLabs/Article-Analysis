NAVI MUMBAI: Over 3,500 shanties were razed near   in sector 11 of Khanda Colony on Wednesday in a joint drive conducted by Cidco and Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC). 

 Civic chief   was there to monitor the drive, which had over 150 cops as security cover.
 
 Cidco cleared encroachments on an open plot measuring about 16 hectares. The town planning body could not take action against these slum dwellers as they had some political leaders’ backing, said sources. 
 
 But some local activists raised their voice against the encroachments. Many such houses had legal power connections. “We cleared around 16 hectares of open land. We were waiting for police protection to clear this huge open plot. It’s a prime location and has premium market value,” said S R Rathod, assistant controller of unauthorized constructions, Cidco.
 
 Shinde said the civic staff was present to support Cidco’s drive.
