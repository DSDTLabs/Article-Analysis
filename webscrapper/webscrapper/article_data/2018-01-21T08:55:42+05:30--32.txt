CHHAPRA: The recent ban on the construction of a ‘chachari’ (bamboo)   over the Ganga owing to security reasons, has given momentum to the demand for a permanent bridge to improve connectivity between   (Saran) and   (Patna). 

 A delegation of the Dighwara residents recently met former Union minister   and district administration officials, demanding the construction of a permanent bridge.
 
 The demand assumes significance as the residents of riverine village   are left with no alternative but to risk their lives by crossing the river through a country boat to reach the district headquarters at Chhapra.
 
 According to sources, the Sonepur SDO recently banned ‘chachari’ bridges. Prior to this, the locals used to create such a bridge.
 
 It may also be mentioned that Rudy during his visit to Akilpur in December last year had assured the people that a permanent bridge would be constructed.
 
 According to Dighwara resident Amit Kumar, if a permanent bridge is constructed between Dighwara and Danapur, it would also reduce the journey hours from Saran to Patna and eastern UP districts. It would also provide connectivity with Champaran and Nepal.
