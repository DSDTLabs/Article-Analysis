BHUBANESWAR: The twin cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack witnessed a spike in rape cases last year, according to the statistics collected by the  , here. In the bulk of the cases the rape accused were known to the survivors. 

 "Rape cases have gone up to 144 (with Bhubaneswar and Cuttack taken together) in 2016 from 127 in 2015. What is more disturbing is the bulk of the   were minor," the police report revealed. While 68 rape survivors were adults, in 76 cases they were minor girls, it added. 
 
 The incidents cast a shadow on the several women-centric safety measures being undertaken by the commissionerate police - from pink auto-rickshaw service for female commuters to Mo Sathi mobile application and self-defence programme for college girls. 
 
 NGOs claimed parents can play a pivotal role in checking atrocities on women. "We often came across children of labourers who have been abused in their absence in slums. The government should identify such slum clusters where labourers reside. Parents must also ensure the safety of their children before leaving their homes for work," said   of Pecuc, a voluntary organisation. 
 
 Lopamudra Buxipatra, chairperson of state commission for women, said: "Though it is the lookout of the police to firmly deal with such cases, we at times refer rape complaints to police when girls or their families are harassed. We have been sensitising survivors through public meetings to come forward and lodge complaints."
