INDORE: A new   will soon come up at   to cater to the needs of the 29 newly inducted villages. IMC officials said that they have given a   (NOC) to the   to open an office in the area.

 Officials said the post office would operate from the old   that has been lying vacant after the areas were brought under the municipal corporation’s limits.
 
 “The postal department has been asking for space in the area for a long time. Since this building was vacant, we decided to give a part of it to them,” zonal officer of zone number 8 told TOI.
 
 Officials said the space has been given out temporarily until the postal department constructs its own office here.
 
 A large number of people live in the newly inducted area. However, with no post office in the area, the residents have had to travel a long distance to avail the service.
 
 “This would be a big relief for us. There were no courier facilities nearby,” said Priya Sachdeva, a resident of the area.
 
 Postal department officials however did not confirm the date from when the post office would begin to operate.
 
 Residents of Nipania have been complaining about the lack of several other facilities in the area like streetlights, Narmada water connection and proper roads.
 
 Officials of the civic body claimed that they were in the process of supplying these basic amenities.
