BATHINDA: A day after Punjab chief minister   expressed displeasure over extortion of ‘goonda tax’ from transporters engaged in supplying building material to the Guru   refinery in Bathinda, the district police on Thursday conducted raids at the residence and other places associated with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) activist   Singh.

 The police also probed the arms licence possessed by Ramandeep against whom a case under charges of house trespass and criminal intimidation was registered last week.
 
 Work on township and a petrochemical project is on at the refinery site.
 
 When contacted, Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP)   confirmed the development and said the raids were conducted on Thursday to arrest Ramandeep and also to check his arms licence. “We are serious about the issue and any complaint of extorting money from the transporters will be dealt with seriously,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, supply of building material, including sand and gravel, resumed on Thursday. Nearly 30 trucks loaded with building material went inside the refinery without anyone stopping them to extort money.
 
 Transporters had been complaining since January 25 about henchmen of the politicians of both the ruling   and SAD, extorting money from them for carrying building material to the refinery.
 
 Bathinda additional deputy commissioner Shena Aggarwal said if asked, the district officials would look into Ramandeep’s arms licence.
 
 A representative of a transport firm said five of their loaded trucks went inside the refinery without any problem.
 
 A refinery official said the district’s civil and police officials were cooperating with them and supply of building material had returned to normal.
