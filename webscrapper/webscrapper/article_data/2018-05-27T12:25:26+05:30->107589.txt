Many like to stay nearby their workplace and want all amenities available around them,” he said Madurai city is set to grow faster structurally with various projects worth crores of rupees going to be implemented soon. Over Rs 1,000 crore to be spent in the city under the smart city project alone. In addition, Rs 1020 crore will be spend on drinking water scheme. While the city is bracing for development, the authorities are planning to make it more walkable.

 Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao said that as people might not be domain experts they are banking on the confidence of the builders while buying house. “They have lived up to the trust of the customers. The builders should help the administration by sticking to the rules and regulation in construction. They should keep in mind the future development and ensure wide roads,” he said. Credai officials R Ilankovan, Tamil Nadu vice-president, Madurai president   and chairman of the fair K Elango Packiaraj took part.
