NAGPUR: Romance was in the air at Suresh Bhat auditorium on Sunday evening as artistes rendered selected hits of Guru and Geeta Dutt. The group Shekhar Naik Productions, Pune, were invited to play the classical melodies at a special concert ‘Guru Geeta’ organized by Maharashtra Times’ Culture Club.

 Singers Ali Hussain, Shamika Bhide, Mukta Joshi and   rendered vocals while Marathi film actor Gauri Konge anchored the show. 
 
 The concert was a mix of audio and visual. Short clips of Guru’s acting stints from movies like ‘Pyaasa’, ‘Mr & Mrs. 55’, ‘Baazi’ and ‘Baaz’ were shown at the event.
 
 The on-screen magic created by actor, director and producer Guru and playback singer Geeta is now considered to be the golden era of Indian cinema. The artistes married in 1953 and worked together in several films.
 
 The couple’s romance reflected in ‘Sun Sun Sun Sun Zaalima’ from the 1954 comedy Aar Paar, which Guru acted in, directed and produced. The song was originally performed by Mohammad Rafi and Geeta.
 
 The audience admired Geeta’s classic rendition of ‘Tadbir se Bigdi Hui Taqdir’ from the 1951 ‘Baazi’ directed by Guru and starring actor  . 
 
 The clip from the movie ‘Aar Paar’, which showed Dutt’s character attempting to obtain a character certificate from a police station to marry actor Shyama’s character, led to another one of Geeta’s admired numbers ‘Yeh Lo Mai Haari Piya’.
 
 However, ‘Thandi Hawa Kaali Ghata’ from Mr & Mrs 55 stole the show as the audience requested a second helping of the performance. The mood then mellowed down with ‘Jaane woh kaise log the’ from Guru’s 1957 ‘Pyaasa’ starring Waheda Rehman. The movie was a story of a poet’s struggles in the 50s Calcutta (now Kolkata).
 
 The mellowness prevailed with ‘Mujhe jaa na kaho meri jaan’, Geeta’s final performance before her death from the 1971 drama ‘Anubhav’ starring   and Tanuja. ‘Aaj Sajan Mohe Ang Laga Lo’ from Pyaasa was rendered before the interval.
