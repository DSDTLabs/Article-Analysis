IMPHAL: It's been 16 years since the sound of her familiar bicycle bell vanished from the streets of Imphal. For long, people haven't seen her making her way through crowded roads riding her black cycle flashing that beaming smile. 

  will witness that familiar sight again when their 'Iron Lady'  , along with supporters of her newly floated People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA), will hit the winding 18-km road from Imphal to   in a bicycle to file her nomination.
 
 Sharmila, who is contesting from Thoubal, the home turf of chief minister  , said, "By Friday, I will fix the date of filing my nomination papers. It's most likely to be done on February 15," Sharmila said on Thursday afternoon, a few minutes after she carried out a house-to-house campaign in some parts of Thoubal.
 
 "Many prominent persons, senior citizens and students have promised to join me on that day. I still remember my blissful days when I used to move around Imphal riding my bicycle," said Sharmila.
