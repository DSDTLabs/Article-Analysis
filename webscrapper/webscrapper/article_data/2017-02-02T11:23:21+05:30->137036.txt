BHOPAL: Security is beefed up for   Singh at   and Hospital in Bhopal after the Dewas court acquitted her in the RSS pracharak  , on Wednesday.

 “Truth always prevails and I do not have a grudge against anyone,” Sadhvi said while talking through her brother-in-law  .
 
 In April this year, Thakur blamed the state government for restricting her from visiting her spiritual guru during Simhastha fair. “At that time, the government was against court’s order. The court allowed me to visit Ujjain and as the government was not listening to the orders, I said those words to the government. A ‘sanyasi’ harbours no bad feelings against any one. I do not have any ill feeling against anyone,” she said while talking through Jha.
 
 Usually, three police personnel were deployed at the hospital for security purposes and one police patrolling vehicle stationed at present. “Today, the security has been beefed up and there are around 14 police personnel and four police vehicles at the hospital,” Jha said.
 
 Now that Thakur is acquitted in the Sunil Joshi murder case and there is no case against her in  . “As she is not in good health, we will discuss a course of action and it is more likely we will request the court to allow her undergo treatment at this hospital,” Jha said.
