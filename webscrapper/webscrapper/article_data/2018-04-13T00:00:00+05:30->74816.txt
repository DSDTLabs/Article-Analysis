For  , starring in   — produced by Trivikram Sapalaya, under the Druthi Creations and Sree Kadari Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Productions banners — not only gave him an opportunity to share screen space with acting greats such as V   and  , but it was also educational in some form, as he got to know about a thriving seizing industry that he was previously unaware of. As the film releases today, he tells us, “Seizer is a good revenge film that is made well. It is very interesting, because the seizing of vehicles is such that the seizers, who are rowdies as well, seize cars from police colonies as well, despite there being so many cops around. They don’t need a key for each car; there is a master key that can open any car. It was exciting to play someone like that and in the process, there were many moments when I wondered, ‘Can there be people like this as well?’ So, it was educational in some manner.”

 Chiranjeevi adds that the other thing to look out for in this commercial entertainer is his and Ravichandran’s combination onscreen, as well as the Crazy Star’s with Prakash. “It will be interesting to uncover how Ravi sir and I are connected in the movie, and also how Ravi sir and Prakash sir are pitted against each other. Whatever scenes I have with Ravi sir are the most memorable for me. Being with him is always fun and working with him was a very good opportunity, since I learnt many nuances of acting, such as being spontaneous and humourous,” says Chiranjeevi. The actor couldn’t bid us adieu to us before heaping praises on music director and singer  . “Seizer is his first film as a music director and he’s done a very good job. All the numbers are peppy and you will instantly like them,” he says, signing off.
