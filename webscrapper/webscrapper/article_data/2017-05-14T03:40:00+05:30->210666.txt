Panaji: The introduction of the ‘first-in-the-country’ sightseeing buses will bring Goa on par with several iconic cities of the world, including Singapore, Rome, London and a few other destinations, said tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar, after flagging off the hop-on-hop-off (HOHO) tour services on Saturday.

 It has been conceptualised on the lines of the HOHO bus tour of London to enable tourists to visit prominent destinations across the city at their convenience and catch a bus every 20-30 minutes by using a single card. 
 
 The royal red buses will offer tourists sightseeing circuits in and around Panaji, Old Goa, Miramar and Dona Paula to begin with. 
 
 The buses will move from Paryatan Bhavan giving tourists an experience of the Panaji Church, Archbishop’s Palace, Miramar beach, Goa Science Centre, Dona Paula, Kala Academy, Bhagwan Mahaveer Garden, Panaji market, casino point, river cruise point, Goa state museum, Ribandar-Patto circle and return to the Paryatan Bhavan. The service will operate from 9am to 6pm.
 
 Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) launched the hop-on hop-off bus, including two double-decker buses, which will be operated by the Pune-based private bus operator, Prasanna Purple. The service will operate on public private partnership. 
 
 “Goa will be famous and the buses will be iconic. At the sight of them one will remember Goa. We are eager to go ahead despite all the hurdles we have had to overcome,” Azgaonkar said.
 
 Other officials present during the launch were GTDC chairman Nilesh Cabral, CCP mayor Surendra Furtado, director of tourism Menino D’Souza and managing director of the GTDC, Nikhil Desai.
