BHOPAL: “I am not happy. From my point of view, you can say I am satisfied. Even if the court had freed the accused, my reaction would have been the same,” said Syed Masood Sultan, Shehla’s father while reacting to   (CBI) court verdict on Saturday that awarded life-imprisonment to four accused including Zahida Parvez.

 Less than a month ago, the 75-year-old was on ventilator life-support with his family by his side. Though he put up a brave face, he could not hide his tears.
 
 “My first reaction was to remember my daughter,” said Masood after hearing the judgement. His health condition is being monitored by his other daughter who lives in the United States. Taking no chances, the family took Masood for a medical check-up. On his way back, the father offered Fatiha or prayer for the deceased. 
 
 At the Koh-e-Fiza residence of the Masood’s it was nearly a repeat of 2011. Media crew descended and waited for the father to speak. At the entrance there is still a wooden swing, and bamboo furniture. The silence of Shehla, the activist is very evident.
 
 On Saturday, he was far more reserved and cautious. Perhaps in the last five years, the retired school teacher has learnt the art of leaving others to fill in the blanks.
 
 Has justice been delivered, screamed a voice from the waiting reporters. “The case was not filed by me. It was CBI versus the accused. The court punished those it understood to be guilty and absolved those it felt were not guilty,” he replied.
 
 Masood recollected a moment during which he met Zahida the prime accused in court. I got off the podium, Zahida held my legs. I asked her what she had done and then cried endlessly. She gave me water and said, “Once I come out of jail, I will be a daughter like Shehla to you.”
 
 Masood clarified he would not like to meet Zahida, the prime accused in the murder of her daughter. “Last night, I thought about her two kids and wished well for Zahida, only for the sake of her children,” said Masood.
