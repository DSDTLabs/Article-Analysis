NAGPUR: Industrial associations of the region feel that small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) do not get a level playing field with large-scale industries when bank loan rates are considered. They want the union budget to end this discrepancy by reducing interest rates for SMEs. The local captains of industry and trade also have several other expectations from the budget to be presented on Wednesday.

 Chandramohan Randhir, president of MIDC (Hingna) Industries Association (MIA), said that industrialists in India got loan at between 13% and 16% interest against global standards of between 9% and 10%. “In our country big industries are able to reduce the rate through negotiation but small industries have to accept the bank’s terms and conditions. Therefore, rates for SMEs should be reduced to 9%,” he told TOI.
 
 Randhir added that at present service tax eligibility was Rs 10 lakh per annum. “This should be doubled. Similarly, excise qualifying limited should be increased from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 5 crore per annum. Income tax slab for 10% tax should be increased to Rs 10 lakh. This will give big relief to small tax players,” he added.
 
 Nitin Lonkar, president of Butibori Manufacturers’ Association (BMA), also demanded reduction in interest rates for SMEs. “Start Up India started with a bang but is now not going great guns. I feel new industries need more incentives. Railways should focus on infrastructure development and users should get incentives for making digital payments,” he said.
 
 Madhusudan Rungta, president of  , said that the interest rates should be reduced by at least 3%. “There should be a compulsion for big industries to procure at least 20% of their requirement from local small industries. The power tariff in the state is very high and we don’t get a level playing field. We expect the government to announce a uniform tariff for industries in the country,” he added.
 
 BC Bhartia, president of   (CAIT), said that an effective scheme for financial inclusion of small traders should be launched. “Government should stop charging commission on digital payments. The margin of traders in India especially on FMCG products is very less and paying commission makes B2B transactions unviable,” he added.
 
 A major problem for traders according to Bhartia was that government now expects them to keep tab on not only on payment of indirect tax but also on direct taxes. “This is not our job. Our core activity is doing business and we should be given ample time to do that. Nowadays traders are spending their time doing statutory compliances,” he added.
 
 Bhartia also demanded that the government should take steps to infuse liquidity in the markets to help the fledgling the real estate sector.
