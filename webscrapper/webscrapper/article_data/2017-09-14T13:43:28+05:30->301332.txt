NEW DELHI: The   party yesterday wondered whether the   has an ulterior motive in hosting 
  , especially considering Assembly polls are due in the state soon.

 "  goes to the polls soon, could it be that the 
  for political ends?" asked Congress spokesman Manish Tewari.
 
  
  
 
 The Congress was talking about the fact that the Japanese PM's two-day state visit to India is 
  , with not a single event or day spent in the Capital.
 
 The Congress party's Tewari acknowledged that he didn't want to "transgress propriety" by talking about a diplomatic visit by a foreign head of state. Yet, he couldn't help wonder and went so far as to call the turn of events "quixotic". 
 
 "We do not want to transgress propriety by commenting on a state visit but it is rather quixotic that the Prime Minister of a country as important as Japan, who is almost India's strategic partner in many respects, is strangely not even being hosted in Delhi," said Tewari, as quoted by PTI.
 
 The fourteenth Gujarat legislative assembly election will be held likely in December for the 182 constituencies in the state. Both the Congress and the BJP, as well as other parties have launched their poll campaigns in the state.
 
 On Monday, the BJP's election in charge for Gujarat, Arun Jaitley, and co-in charge Nirmala Sitharaman met members of the state party's core group here to chalk out strategy for the polls.
 
 "The BJP in Gujarat has started its preparations for the forthcoming assembly polls. I along with Gujarat CM and Sitharamanji sat with the core team of the state to formulate the strategy for the polls. We also attended the workshop for those who handle media and social media," Jaitley told reporters after the meeting.
 
 As many as 500 party workers associated with state BJP's media and social media operations received guidance from senior leaders at the workshop, said a party release.
