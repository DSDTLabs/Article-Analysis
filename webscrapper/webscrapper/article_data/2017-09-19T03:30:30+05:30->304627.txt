NEW DELHI: A medicine student, training as an anaesthetist at  , allegedly committed suicide at his rented house in central Delhi on Monday. Police have recovered a suicide note, a syringe and vial of medicine from the room, which have been sent for forensic analysis.

 In the note, the student Siddarth Shankar Mahapatra (26) claimed that he took the extreme step because he was depressed. Police said they were probing if the victim had some mental disorder or was cheated by someone.
 
 Police received a call at 8.38am from Mahapatra’s roommate, following which a team reached the second floor of the house at Rajendra Nagar. Mahapatra, a resident of Odisha, was found hanging from the ceiling fan using trousers. “We called the crime team and shifted the body to the RML Hospital for an autopsy. The cause of the suicide is yet to be ascertained,” said Mandeep Singh Randhawa, DCP, central.
 
 Mahapatra, a first-year MBBS student, stayed with two other students. One of his roommates had gone to meet his parents, while the other was away on a night duty at the hospital.
 
 In the suicide note, Mahapatra mentioned about his  , perhaps work-related, and claimed that he was feeling like a prisoner. Police said that his family has been informed and the autopsy would be conducted once they arrive. 
 
 Preliminary inquiry suggests that he had first injected the medicine and then hanged himself. An inquest under 174 CrPC has been initiated.
 
 Hospital authorities said that Mahapatra had recently attended a protocol on thesis presentation and was preparing for it.
