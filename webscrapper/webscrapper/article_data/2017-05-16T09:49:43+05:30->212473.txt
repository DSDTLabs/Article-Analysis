NEW DELHI:  's swashbuckling knocks this season helped   pull off a couple of wins but the 19-year-old was not consistent enough. Still, the Daredevils, which let   go in 2008, and thereafter David Warner, Ab de Villers and   among others, are keen to continue with Pant in the coming seasons.

 The reason for this is that Delhi's mentor   and his coaching staff have suggested to the management that Pant should be a must for the team, sources told TOI. "The coaching panel has made it clear to the Delhi management that Pant should be the top choice for the team in future," a source told TOI minutes after Delhi lost their last game of the season to the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 10 runs on Sunday night.
 
 If the   governing council bats in favour of an open auction without retention, which is likely, Delhi is certain to ask for a matching card and the Delhi management has already being advised to make Pant their top player at next year's auction.
 
 Dravid didn't make a public statement about Pant's future status with the Daredevils, but he praised him for his performance. "Rishabh played very well this year. He entered the tournament at a very a difficult time. He lost his father, but overcame that tragedy and did consistently well throughout the season. I am sure he will go on to become a very important player for India," Daredevils' mentor Dravid said.
 
 The Indian legend also said he was disappointed with the way Delhi played and that losing five to six close games put pressure on the team.
 
 Injuries to key players and losing key foreign recruits like Quinton de Kock and JP Duminy before the tournament started contributed to the poor show.
