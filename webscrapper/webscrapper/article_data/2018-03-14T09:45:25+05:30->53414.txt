NASHIK: Apprehending possible accidents on the   highway, especially in the densely populated regions of   and Khed, the National Highway Authority of India ( ) has decided to construct foot overbridges (FOB) at different locations of the route. 

 One FOB was recently constructed and thrown open for pedestrians at Malwadi, Shivaji Nagar in Sinnar taluka, while three more are in the pipeline.
 
 The exact locations of the three FOB would be finalised soon. Senior officials said that one could come up in   district and the remaining two could be in Pune district. Once the locations are finalised, the work of the FOBs would be completed within a matter of a few months. 
 
 Senior officials of NHAI said that the FOB near Malwadi was constructed at a cost of Rs 88 lakh to assist the villagers and students there, who often have to cross the highway for some or the other purpose.
 
 The work of widening the Sinnar-Khed stretch of highway got over about a year ago. Apart from the difficulty faced by the villagers to cross the highway, crossing the widened road had become a challenge for many students who have to attend school on the other side of the road.
 
 NHAI officials said that vehicles travel fast on the highway and pedestrian crossing becomes a challenge for them as well. While the drivers have to suddenly control the vehicle if a villagers come in the way, pedestrians struggle to cross the road in the short time between spotting the vehicle and it reaching them. 
 
 A few years back, an 18-year-old girl,  , was crushed to death by a speeding car on the Mumbai-Agra highway, near Vilholi. She was crossing the highway to fetch water when the car hit her. The impact was such that the girl died on the spot.
