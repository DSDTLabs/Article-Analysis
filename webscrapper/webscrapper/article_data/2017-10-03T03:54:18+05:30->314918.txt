BENGALURU: Popular actor Prakash Raj has criticised Prime Minister   for his silence on social media trolls hurling abuses at him and also those who condemned activist-journalist Gauri Lankesh’s murder.

 “I haven’t heard such bad language in all my life that the trolls are using against me on Twitter and Facebook. It is astonishing that these people are being followed by the Prime Minister, and the PM is silent about it,” said Raj.
 
 Observing that politicians like   chief minister   Adityanath are bigger actors than film stars, Raj said they deserved the national awards given to him for his acting talent.
 
 His remarks came at an event organised by   ( ) in Bengaluru on Sunday.
 
 Referring to the UP chief minister being a pontiff and also holding the CM’s office, Raj said Yogi was performing a dual role, like an actor. “Watching the video of Yogi Adityanath, one should appreciate his acting prowess. He is performing the dual role of chief minister as well as a priest. I have won five national awards. But these politicians deserve these awards,” he said.
 
 While his remarks were perceived as an intention to return the national awards, Raj clarified on Monday that he had never said that he wanted to return his awards.
 
 “I am not so dumb to return the awards given in recognition of my talent and hard work. The reports saying I offered to return the awards are baseless,” he told a news channel.
