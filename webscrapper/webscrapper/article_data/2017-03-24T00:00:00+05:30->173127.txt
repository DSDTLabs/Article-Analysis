How many of us would have thought about beautifying a public place like a railway station, let alone a public latrine? 

 But that is what these students of St Xavier’s College set out to do, on a Saturday morning. With a few master strokes, the students gave the walls of the ‘pay and use’ washroom at the   a complete revamp. 
 
  The youngsters were backed by their teachers for the project, who also gave them a hand. Resmi Varghese, assistant professor of the college, says, “The students inscribed railway rules, maxims related to cleanliness and other designs on the walls, which managed to catch the eye of the passersby. Such an attempt grabs more attention that an event on the streets. It reaches people of different social backgrounds, and the message is conveyed more easily.”
 
  The slogans that found its place on the walls were, ‘Be part of the solution, not the pollution’ and ‘Ek kadam swachta ki aur’. Keerthy D P, a student from the department of Mathematics says that it was a completely enriching and enjoyable experience for the students. She adds, “Our initiative was mainly to tell people that cleanliness should always be one’s priority. It was also a means to educate the public.”
  From around 10 am to 6 pm, the students immersed themselves in the cleanliness drive. She says, “We were happy that people came up to us to give suggestions and also complimented all the students for the much needed effort.” 
 
  Lekshmi Dileep, another student from the department of Physics was initially sceptical about the attempt. However, the exercise boosted their morale and instilled confidence in their minds, she says. She concludes, “It reinforced the fact that we were doing something for the betterment of society. It also pointed towards the need for more of such attempts, which will result in a positive change.”
