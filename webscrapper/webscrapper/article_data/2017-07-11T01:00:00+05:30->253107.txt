GAYA: Altogether 47   dealers have booked in Gaya district in the last ten days for selling on the black market the foodgrains meant for distribution among the marginalized sections of the society. More cases are likely to be registered in the coming days.

 The racket came to light during intensive scrutiny of records and spot inspection at several PDS shops by senior officials of the district. The PDS dealers have also been accused of overcharging, under-weighing and cheating gullible cardholders.
 
 As per the distribution protocol, Antyodaya scheme beneficiaries are entitled to 35kg of foodgrains per month (14kg wheat and 21kg rice) at a highly subsidized rate (wheat Rs2/kg and rice Rs3/kg). Besides the Antyodaya beneficiaries, the priority households are to get 5kg foodgrain per person (wheat 2kg and rice 3kg). The official rate of kerosene oil is fixed at Rs21 per litre.
 
 According to official records, 11 PDS dealers have been booked in Belaganj block, followed by 10 each in Fatehpur and Bodh Gaya block. Nine dealers have been booked in Paraiya block. The divisional commissioner has cautioned officials against complacency in dealing with PDS licence holders and supply officials, who are allegedly hand in glove with the racketeers.
 
 Show-cause notices have been served on the marketing officers of the blocks where large-scale bungling had been detected during inquiry. The marketing officers have been given three days to reply. In case their explanation is not found satisfactory, departmental proceedings would be initiated against them, collectorate sources said.
