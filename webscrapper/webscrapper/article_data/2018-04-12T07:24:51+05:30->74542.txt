KOCHI: The high court, on Wednesday, allowed vigilance and anti-corruption bureau ( ) to continue the investigation in microfinance scam allegedly involving   Yogam general secretary  . 

 Considering petitions for quashing the FIR, the court directed that an IPS officer (not below the rank of superintendent of police) should conduct the investigation against Natesan and the other accused. HC has removed Kerala State Backward Classes Development Corporation ( ) former MD Najeeb from the list of accused.
 
 The directives were issued by the court while disposing the petition filed by Natesan and Najeeb for quashing the FIR. 
 
 The case was registered on a complaint filed by V S Achuthanandan, alleging that SNDP Yogam is not qualified to conduct the microfinance scheme and misappropriation took place.
 
 In the order, the court pointed out that VACB only has Biju Ramesh's statement that Natesan and Najeeb entered into a conspiracy whereas it was a board comprising of Najeeb and other officers of KSBCDC that allotted the fund. 
 
 Other than allocating the fund, Najeeb did not have a role in its disbursement. Najeeb, while he was the secretary of  , had ordered the demolishment of buildings owned by Ramesh's father and this could have given rise to personal animosity. There is no reliable evidence to prove conspiracy, the court said.
 
 Further, the court said it should be inquired whether funds were wrongly allocated to any other organizations like SNDP. Assistance of officers outside VACB can be sought if required, the court said while asking to complete the probe within eight months. 
 
 As per the FIR, SNDP Yogam received Rs15.85 crore from KSBCDC for disbursing as loan to self-help groups among the poor between 2003 and 2014 and misappropriated and misused the money. The loan that was obtained at 5% interest and to be repaid at 3% was given to an SHG at 7.84%, VACB had informed the high court.
