GURUGRAM: A fast-track court will be set up in Gurgaon for the trial of  , who has been accused of killing seven-year-old Ryan school student Pradhyumn Thakur. Kumar was produced in the Sohna court after three-day police custody on Tuesday, and was sent to   till September 18. Sources said a chargesheet would be filed by Saturday in the case.

 Kumar, who is facing a boycott by lawyers, was represented by advocate Saurav Raghav of legal aid service on Tuedsay. 
 
 “The court provides a lawyer under legal aid service to the accused who can’t afford or manage to get any advocate,” Raghav said, adding that Kumar was quiet during the court hearing. “He didn’t even talk to me. He doesn’t utter a word in the court,” Raghav said.
 
 People who attended the court hearing said Kumar was looking very weak and struggled to hold a pen to sign on the papers. 
 
 “His hand was shivering and looks very weak,” said a person who was inside the court. 
 
 Sohna has only courts of judicial magistrate 1st class (JMIC), which can award imprisonment up to three years only. “It is a case of murder. The guilty can get up to life imprisonment or capital punishment. The trial of such cases can be conducted only in session courts. So the case would be transferred to a special court,” said a lawyer.
 
 Ryan International School’s north India head Francis Thomas and Bhondsi campus main administrator Jeyus Thomas will be produced in the Sohna court on Wednesday, according to sources. They were booked under the JJ Act and are now in police custody. 
 
 All the court proceedings will be conducted in the special court.
