Lucknow: On Saturday, 96 school vehicles in Lucknow were caught plying without the safety norms in place. The crackdown on the part of the transport department across the state has come in the wake of the Etah accident in which 12 school kids lost their lives when their bus rammed a truck on Thursday.

 The number of school vans caught in Saturday’s drive was more than the school buses. The enforcement officers at the   (RTO) seized five   and 19 vans for being unfit. Their drivers could not produce the fitness certificate. Another 15 buses were challaned for not having either a CNG-leakage certificate, seat belts, fire extinguishers, first-aid boxes or their drivers not holding a DL and 57 school vans were challaned for similar offences. “We are issuing notices to schools as well to ensure that their vehicles have all the documents while on road, said   (Enforcement), Lucknow, Vidisha Singh. The drive will continue, said the officer. 
 
 The transport department’s order says enforcement officers will have to hold a meeting with school management or principals and ensure that no driver of school vehicles uses mobile phones or earphones while on duty. 
 
 Action should be taken against the errant driver and he should be removed from the job, it says. 
 
 School management and principals should also ensure they do not pressure drivers to reach on time “at any cost”. No action should be taken against the driver who fails to make it on time in case of a traffic blockade or a jam.
