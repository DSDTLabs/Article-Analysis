ALLAHABAD: The   on Wednesday dismissed a PIL challenging reservation of Dudhi and Obra constituency of   district for Schedule Tribes (ST) in the state assembly elections. It said that   (ECI) had taken the decision on the basis of census data hence the court could not interfere in this matter.

 The judgment was given by a division bench comprising Justice Vimlesh Kumar Shukla and Justice   who had earlier reserved its judgement while hearing a PIL filed by   of Sonbhadra.
 
 The petitioner's contention was that Dudhi and Obra were reserved for Schedule Tribes on the basis of an ordinance issued by central government in 2013 but this ordinance had lapsed hence the reservation of seats was wrong.
