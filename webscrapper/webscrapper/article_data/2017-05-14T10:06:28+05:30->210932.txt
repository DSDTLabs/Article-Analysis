The consultant will finalize the building’s design in terms of modes of connectivity to the old building, parking and such. We aim to finish the work ahead of schedule if all goes well,” the official said.
 
 The new building can handle around 5,000 passengers at any given time. Officials said work on expanding the existing building is going at full speed.
 
 “The traffic congestion issue in front of the building is also being addressed. Once the expansion is complete, the old building’s passenger-intake capacity will increase to 1,500, from the existing 1,200,” another official said.
