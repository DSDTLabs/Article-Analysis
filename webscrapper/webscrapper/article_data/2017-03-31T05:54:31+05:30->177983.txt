GURUGRAM: The   along with the   is all set to run a project from April under which they will educate, create awareness and implement   in residential areas with the help of a special bio culture.

 According to the officials at   department, this bio culture can be used for treating segregated home   and converting it into compost which can further be used in kitchen gardens.
 
 “The bio culture which comes in liquid form has to be mixed in with jaggery and water. It can then be used to treat the kitchen waste and convert it into compost without the help of a composting unit,” said Deen Mohammad Khan, district horticulture officer, Gurgaon.
 
 The idea behind the project, Khan says is to ensure that the garbage influx to the Bandhwari waste plant can be reduced as much as possible. 
 
 The aim of the project is to get more and more residential condominiums to adopt waste segregation and composting with the use of bio culture. 
 
 Many of the residential condominiums are already working on waste segregation and composting but they are all working with NGOs or other organisations and are using composting units. The proposed method would help residents’ compost at a much lower cost compared to the other methods, say the officials.
 
 “I welcome the initiative as waste treatment is the need of the hour and the initiative will encourage people to take it up,” said Ravi Chandra, RWA member, Sector 52. Chandra has been composting for the last six months.
 
 The municipal corporation of Gurgaon is also working towards encouraging the   to adopt waste segregation and waste management.
