The company has fixed a two-hour deadline for its field staff to address a consumer’s complaint. Hardly 1 percent of the complaints are not being addressed on time. 
 
 “This increase in number of complaints is obvious. Most of these complaints are related with service lines disruption, disconnection of jumper or fuse,” said Subroto Roy, discom’s superintendent engineer. 
 
 He said that these calls occur mostly due to loose connection or overloading which leads to heating and short circuit at junction points, mostly in the service lines.
