NOIDA: A 14-year-old girl was forced to get ready for marrying a 19-year-old youth by her own family members to enable her to escape harassment at the hands of her mentally challenged brother.

 However, a timely tip-off by locals helped the police stop the wedding by arriving at the spot around 8pm on Friday.
 
 The minor girl was decked out in a bride’s attire when she was rescued by the police from a house in Gali No. 1 of Nithari village in Sector 31.
 
 According to neighbours, the family of the girl belongs to West Bengal and her parents work as domestic helps in a nearby house in Nithari.
 
 The police received a call from a functionary of the BJP’s mahila morcha and raided the spot where some members of the family and the girl were present.
 
 “The house was raided before the wedding could take place. It was found that the girl was minor and she was taken to the district hospital, Sector 30, for an age determination test,” Prahlad Kumar, sub-inspector, Sector 20 police station, told TOI. The medical test confirmed the girl to be a minor and she was later handed over to Chidline.
 
 Parimal Rajvanshi, a neighbour who was present at the wedding, said the girl was a minor from a poor family. “She has a mentally challenged elder brother who has tried to beat up his parents many a time and has been misbehaving with the girl when they are away at work. We could not think of any other way out for the girl and the wedding was fixed with consent of the two families,” he said.
 
 The teenager’s mother and other relatives were speechless and shocked when they saw the   mahila morcha members and the police arrive at the wedding venue.
 
 When contacted, Satya Prakash, of Childline, said that the NGO’s counsellors would talk to the girl.
