JAIPUR: Former chief minister   on Tuesday said he became a chief minister after having served as the   (PCC) chief thrice in 14 years. Gehlot’s remark was seen in the party circles as his claim for the state’s top post once again vis-à-vis  , who is having his first stint as the PCC chief.

 The politicking followed Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s statement—made in New Delhi earlier in the day—on the need for structural and organisational changes in the party after the latest assembly election results in five states. Agreeing with the Congress vice-president, Gehlot said ‘old’ and ‘new’ leaders have to work together and grow gradually.
 
 “When   was the Prime Minister, young people got the opportunity to be union ministers. I also became a union minister during the tenure of  ,” Gehlot said, while talking to reporters at his residence here. “Gradually the opportunity does come. I became the chief minister after serving as PCC chief for the third time, 14 years after my first appointment to the post. This is how the progress continues all over the country,” Gehlot said.
 
 The senior leader, who was being congratulated by the Congressmen for his role in the party’s victory in Punjab assembly elections, said the ‘old’ will make way for the ‘new’. “It is our duty to encourage the new generation. And, it is the duty of the new generation to take everyone along with them,” Gehlot said.
 
 Even though the Congress has suffered big blows in elections since 2013-14, the party’s state unit has routinely witnessed supremacy tussles among its senior leaders. The second-rung leaders too appear divided into different camps, depending on their affiliations to top leaders. Often, sitting as well as former legislators from these camps have publicly voiced their preferences for the leadership in state.
