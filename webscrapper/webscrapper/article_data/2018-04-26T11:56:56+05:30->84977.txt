HYDERABAD: It’s an easy ‘booze pass’ for underage drinkers in the city, as Telangana   it difficult to keep a check on liquor being served at pubs and bars to people below the age of 21.

 Customers easily get away by providing fake identity proofs (IDs) to get access to alcohol, deputy commissioner, prohibition and excise department (Hyderabad division) C   said.
 
 
 
  
 
 "There are around 500 pubs and bars in Hyderabad, including those located on the outskirts. These days, the youth have become very smart. They provide fake ID proofs or scanned ID proofs. Pubs and bars consider serving liquor to the underage a minor offence," Reddy added. In the past one year, only one bar/pub was booked for violating the rule, he added.
 
 Experts have raised concern over the fact that authorities don’t take this violation seriously, which is considered a criminal offence abroad."The authorities have been taking underage drinking very lightly. Currently, the pub/bar management manually check IDs of people who appear to be in their late or early twenties. However, people may create fake IDs. So, there must be a mechanism to check the validity of the ID like laser printing or use of tamper-proof security features. In the US, underage drinking is a criminal offence, however, here people easily get away with it," Bhagi Nanda Sandilya, founder and CEO of  , told 
 .
 
 According to experts, nearly 60% of pub-goers, especially during happy hours, are college students, but still most pubs and bars in the city do not check ID proofs.
 
 "We talked to several college students who said that most pubs do not ask for ID proofs. The authorities should not put all enforcement responsibilities on pubs and bars, after all, they are running businesses. At the end of the day, they want to make money," Vinod Kumar Kanumala, founder of  , said.
