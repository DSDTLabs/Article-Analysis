KOLKATA:   has decided to call a syndicate (highest administrative decision making body) meeting on February 16 to place the matter of student assault on Bhaskar Chandra Das, the head of department of chemical engineering. 

 Das was allegedly slapped and threatened by a section of   leaders on Tuesday on the   campus of CU. On Thursday, he lodged an FIR with the Amherst Street police station.
 
 Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee, vice-chancellor of CU, and pro-VC (finance) Minakshi Roy met Das on the campus on Thursday and and spoke to him for two hours. 
 
 "I assured him that we will take up the matter immediately in the syndicate meeting. We faced similar humiliation last year when we were pushed, shoved and heckled by agitating students while coming out of office. Assault on teachers cannot be tolerated," said the VC. Sources said CU may draw up a mechanism to check student assault on teachers. 
 
 Das, who was allegedly shoved and slapped by some third year students of BTech, has mentioned the names of the suspects involved in the assault. Das was also allegedly verbally abused by the students. 
 
 Education minister Partha Chatterjee said that he wanted the university to find out what had happened. Chatterjee added that the   leadership would take up the matter and see if the students were involved in the case.
 
 Trinamool Chhatra Parishad state president Jaya Dutta met Chatterjee in the assembly on Thursday where the minister asked her about the incident.
 
 Meanwhile, students of Ananda Mohan College, who were not handed registration by CU following additional intake, staged an agitation on Thursday. A section of the students even pelted stones at teachers while they were coming out of the college. Officers from Amherst Street PS went to the college to bring the situation under control.
