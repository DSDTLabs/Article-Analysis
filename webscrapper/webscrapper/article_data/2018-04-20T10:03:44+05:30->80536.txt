MYSURU:   Revanna, a ZP member and wife of former minister H D Revanna, on Thursday landed in a controversy after a video in which she asks JD(S) workers from K R Nagar to work against the party candidate, Sa Ra Mahesh, who is seeking his third win on the trot, went viral.

 
 While the embarrassed MLA sought to give it a different spin saying she has not named him but was speaking about the   candidate, Bhavani has chosen to keep mum. She refused to comment on the alleged video or its contents.
 
 Bhavani , who is native of Saligrama in K R Nagar taluk in   district, has allegedly asked a bunch of party activists to work against Mahesh, who is looking at a hat-trick win. At a meeting with party workers in Holenarsipur, she accuses him of being arrogant and needs to be taught a lesson. She tells the party activists that she will protect them.
 
 Soon after the video went viral, Mahesh sought to play it down arguing that Bhavani is referring to the Congress candidate, not him. He told TOI that she has not named him. “I have nothing to do with the video,” he stated.
 
 When reporters approached Bhavani, she didn’t respond.
 
 Sources said Bhavani is upset with Mahesh as she holds him responsible for her son Prajwal Revanna being a denied a party ticket from   segment in Mysuru district. Though Prajwal had been touring the segment for six months, he was asked to go slow and the party high command allotted the ticket to the former MP Adagooru H Vishwanath after he switched over from Congress. “She holds Mahesh responsible for Prajwal missing the bus,” said a party worker.
