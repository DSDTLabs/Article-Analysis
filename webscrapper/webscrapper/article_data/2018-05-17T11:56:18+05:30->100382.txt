BENGALURU: Seven candidates, who had contested under the banner of the   (AIMEP) in the assembly polls, have filed a cheating case against their party’s national president  .

 The candidates alleged that Nowhera Shaik collected cheques from them in the name of party fund, but did not give money for campaigning as promised earlier. She had promised up to Rs 28 lakh for each contestant.
 
 In the FIR, a copy of which is available with TOI, S Krishna, who contested from   constituency, alleged that Shaik took a cheque of Rs 50,000 from him without mentioning the recipient’s name, stating that it’s for the party fund. However, she was unavailable when they tried to meet her later. Her close aides informed the candidates that they would disburse Rs 2 crore (black money) via various means, following which blank cheques were collected from them. “We were denied entry to her office in Leela Palace. Later, cops arrived and took us to a police station where we filed a complaint,” Krishna told TOI.
 
 Ajjaiah H who contested from Hagaribommanahalli constituency, Kalavathi from Sagar constituency and   M T from Channagiri constituency have also lodged complaints. Kalavathi alleged that Nowhera took a cheque of Rs 5 lakh from her without mentioning the recipient’s name and claimed 20 candidates have lost money.
 
 Sources from MEP said the money was collected from candidates initially to prevent them from withdrawing nominations or shifting loyalty to other parties in the last minute. 
 
 DCP (East) Ajay Hilori confirmed that cheating cases had been registered at Jeevan Bheema Nagar police station and the matter will be probed. Meanwhile, MEP spokesperson said he would comment on the issue later.
