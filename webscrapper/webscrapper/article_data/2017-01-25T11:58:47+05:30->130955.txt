PANAJI: Mormugao police booked power minister  , and 12 other persons late Monday evening on charges of outraging the modesty of a 35-year-old woman at Sada, Vasco.

 Four other cases of a similar offence were also registered. “We’ve received five complaints, including three counter-cases of rioting and two counter-cases of outraging modesty,” a Mormugao police officer said.
 
 Dismissing the charges, Naik said, “It is a political gimmick.” 
 
 On Sunday night, a fight broke out between two groups owing allegiance to Congress candidate   and BJP’s Naik during their campaigning trail at Sada.
 
 The first complaint was lodged by   against 11 identified persons and five unidentified persons for threat and abuse. The second was lodged by Shraddha Amonkar, Sankalp’s wife, against nine identified and 15 unidentified persons. The third complaint was lodged by Manuel Frederick Estebeiro against seven identified persons.
 
 The complaint against Naik and 12 others was lodged by a 35-year-old woman, who alleged that her modesty had been outraged. A complaint of a similar offence was lodged by another woman against one identified and six unidentified persons. Both have been registered under Section 354, IPC, while the other three have been registered as non-cognizable offences. Mormugao police is probing whether the complaint against Naik is genuine and will act accordingly.
