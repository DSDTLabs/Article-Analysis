Chennai: A JJ Nagar resident on Thursday told police that a man and a   posing as house painters tried to strangle her on Wednesday night when she was alone at home before robbing her of 8 sovereigns of gold jewellery worth Rs 1.85 lakh when she lost consciousness.

 In a police complaint, Jebasti, 29, who lives on 13th Street, JJ Nagar, said her husband Keerthi Inbaraj was away and she was alone at home, watching television, when the couple arrived at at 8.30pm. They said her husband had hired them to paint the house, she said. 
 
 Jebasti said she tried to contact her husband but the call did not go through, so she asked the pair, both in their mid-30s, to return the next morning.
 
 “They suddenly caught hold of me and choked me,” a police officer quoted her complaint as stating. “I struggled and then fainted. When my husband returned, I recovered consciousness and found that they had taken my chain and bangles.”
 
 Police are investigating the case, but are sceptical about the woman’s claims because there was no sign of a struggle in the house.
 
 “Jebasti also did not have any visible injuries to the neck,” the officer said. “The complainant’s neighbours did not see any strangers in the vicinity at the time. We are probing the complaint all the same. Her husband Keerthi Inbaraj said he had to admit her to a hospital.”
