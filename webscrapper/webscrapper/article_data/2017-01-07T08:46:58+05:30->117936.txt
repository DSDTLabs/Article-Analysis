JALANDHAR: Minister of   and   on Friday termed AAP convenor Arvind  . Accusing Kejriwal of tarnishing the image of Punjab and Punjabis, he has also challenged the Delhi chief minister to come out with evidence to prove his claim that there were 40 lakh young addicts in Punjab. “His statements against corruption are just drama. Actually, he is the mother of corruption,” said Sampla, while stating that Kejriwal did not allow any prominent leader of Punjab to grow, and has finished them so that he and his cronies from Delhi could freely indulge in all sorts of corruption and loot in Punjab.

 “He claimed to end corruption and bring in Swaraj, but his own party leaders exposed him. Kejriwal and his coterie are wary of the people of Punjab, and he doesn’t like to be answerable to them. He did not allow any leader of Punjab to develop, and instead, he defamed the state’s leadership and hurt the sentiments of the people,” he said, while addressing a press conference here. “This was the reason he sacked Sucha Singh Chhottepur from the post of state convenor, claiming that there was some video evidence against him, but till date, no video clip has been brought out in the public domain. This happened as he and his coterie feel insecure about Punjab-based leaders of the party,” he said. “He failed to deliver whatever he promised in Delhi, and here also he is promising the moon. He has no qualms in cheating people emotionally and politically,” he said.
 
 Sampla said for his narrow political ends, Kejriwal and his cronies had been defaming Punjab on the issue of drugs without substantiating their allegations, and they never bothered about the image of the state as they went about their slander. He claimed that the response to Vijay Sankalp Rath Yatra from party workers and people was very encouraging. However, when asked about factionalism in the party at the local levels coming out during the yatra, he claimed all was well and even denied incidences of skirmishes.
