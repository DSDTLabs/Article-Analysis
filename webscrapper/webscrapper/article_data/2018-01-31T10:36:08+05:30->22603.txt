BENGALURU: As Bengaluru gets ready for a rare occurrence on Wednesday evening — the earth’s satellite will be deep red during a total   — arrangements are being made for astronomy enthusiasts to view the spectacle, described as the Blood Moon.

 Wednesday’s lunar eclipse is particularly special because two other lunar events will occur on the same day:   and Blue Moon. A Supermoon is when the the moon is at perigee — it’s the closest to the earth and appears 14% larger than usual — while a   is the second full moon of a month, which is very rare.
 
 A Blood Moon (copper red) is when a Supermoon occurs on the same day as the lunar eclipse. Particles in the earth’s atmosphere scatter the sunlight, making the moon look reddish. The moon will appear 14% closer to the earth and 30% brighter from about 6.15pm onwards, when the eclipse occurs. India will be witnessing the Blood Moon after nearly 36 years (the last was seen in 1982).
 
 The city will have several spots where people can enjoy the rare sight.
