LUCKNOW: Budget provisions evoked a mixed response from pensioners on Wednesday. According to office-bearer of the UP Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh R P Mishra said, “Thanks to the  , salaries of teachers have already been hiked to a significant extent, so the new income tax rate will have no significant impact on most of them.” He added that most of the teachers were expecting the Budget would exempt those with income up to Rs 5 lakh annual income from being taxed, but that did not happen.

 Social media activist Aadesh Shukla, said the Budget attempts to redress woes and grievances of almost all sections of the society. “The reduction in income tax rate is welcome for a significant part of the population, especially the service class,” he said.
