Pune: An animal rights’ activist was accused of slapping a resident of Nana Peth on Monday afternoon after she interrupted a civic squad that was catching dogs. Residents had complained to the civic body about the stray dogs. Local residents then beat up the activist. 

 Senior police inspector Rajendra Mohite of Samarth police station told TOI that the police have registered two cross non-cognisable (NC) offences.
 
 Nana Peth resident Rohit Avachite of Nana Peth lodged a complaint against animal rights’ activist Vineeta Tandon while Tandon lodged a complaint against some local residents. Both slapped each other when the PMC team was catching dogs in the area, Mohite said.
 
 “The local residents had written to the PMC about the dogs and the squad was there on Monday afternoon executing the task. Tandon, who came to know about it, rushed to the spot. She claimed she was a government officer and ordered the squad to stop catching the dogs. Tandon is not a government appointed officer,” Mohite said.
 
 The squad stopped its work but local residents demanded that they continue. “Tandon intervened and stopped them. This enraged the residents. In a fit of rage, Tandon slapped Avachite and then the local residents beat her up,” he said.
 
 The dog squad members intervened and stopped the fight and a police team rushed to the spot. “Later, both parties filed NCs,” Mohite said.
 
 Mohite said the civic team was working and the activist should have approached PMC’s higher authorities to stop work instead of taking the law into her hand. He also said the residents should have refrained from beating her up. 
 
 Tandon, honorary animal welfare officer, under the Animal Welfare Board of India, said she went to the society to stop the relocation of sterilized dogs, an old dog with a limp and some puppies, which is illegal.
