Kolkata: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation, which has come up with a plan to illuminate all major thoroughfares of the city with   lights, can follow the New Town model, where more than 50km of road stretches, including the main arterial road, have been illuminated with LEDs.

 Since 2013, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has been installing LED lights on the roads in New Town, replacing the old metal halide and sodium vapour lights. “Street lighting in New Town has seen a major improvement. The entire stretch of the main arterial road is very well lit up,” said Tamal Pal, an IT executive who regularly visits New Town for his work. 
 
 “The system is better in terms of visibility and longevity,” said Suman Saha, a resident of New Town’s Action Area I. 
 
 NKDA authorities said the LED lights were already saving a considerable amount of energy. NKDA chairman Debashis Sen said, “We are very happy with the LED lighting experience. Initially, there was some problem in the LED driver that switches on the light due to some voltage fluctuations, but that problem has now been sorted out and the streetlights are functioning well.” He added that NKDA will replace all CFL lights in the trident poles with LED panels.
 
 NKDA has also gone a step further by conducting a pilot project to switch off one third of the LED streetlights on a 1km stretch in New Town at nights until a vehicle passes by.
