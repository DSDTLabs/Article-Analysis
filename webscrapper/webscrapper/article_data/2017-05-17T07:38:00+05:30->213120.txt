GURUGRAM: The enforcement wing of the department of town and country planning ( ) has sealed a 100-bed hospital being constructed in   on Tuesday, for unauthorised construction. 

 The hospital was being built without approvals from competent authorities, by  , in the revenue estate of village Bhondsi, tehsil  , without the owners having first obtained change of land use (CLU) permission from DTCP. The society had applied for CLU, but DTCP had returned it citing non-availability of adequate access to the site, as per norms.
 
 The action was taken in view of a complaint at the CM Window by a Satparkash in July 2016. “Following the complaint, a showcause notice was issued to the society under provisions of Punjab Scheduled Road and Controlled Area Restriction of Unregulated Development Act, 1963, and several opportunities were provided to the said society, being a charitable hospital, to apply for compounding of said unauthorised constructions, and for obtaining necessary CLU permissions,” said district town planner (enforcement) Rajendra Sharma.
 
 Assistant town planner Narendra Kumar said the society sought time to apply for the fresh CLU permission by April 2017, but failed to submit the application within the prescribed time. “Finally, the unauthorised building of the hospital society was sealed,” said Kumar, adding the society was given adequate time to get the approval.
 
 Officials said absence of an access road was the prime reason for returning the previous CLU request. “The society was given time, but failed to resolve the matter with locals and acquire the land required to build an access road,” said the official, adding that along with the hospital building, which is almost complete, they have also sealed the under-construction staff quarters.
