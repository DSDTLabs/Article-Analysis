MUMBAI:The   (ED) has hired experts from banks to ascertain the value of jewellery seized from premises belonging to diamond businessman   and his associates during raids as part of their investigation into the PNB scam. The stock value of the seized jewellery is Rs 5,716 crore.

 
 A senior ED official said they were collecting intelligence inputs on Nirav and his associates. Once his location is established, the ED will initiate the process to get a letter rogatory issued through court for judicial assistance from the country where he has taken refuge. Nirav, who fled India on January 1, followed by his wife a few days later, is said to be holed up in a swish New York hotel.
 
 The ED is planning to ask   (PNB) to provide its internal audit reports along with the reports of statutory audits conducted by the RBI in the last few years to find out if auditors had detected any fault in the bank's books. The agency has also asked the income tax department to share details of their investigation against Nirav. The ED has not received a reply from Nirav to the summons they sent asking him to appear before the agency for questioning. The summons were the first step towards moving court to declare him an absconder.
