BATHINDA: After   announced his decision to go against his   by not voting for the   for the   on Monday, now all eyes are on   as far as his vote is concerned. Ghubaya has declined to elaborate on his choice and says he will definitely vote on Monday in Delhi.

 Despite having been elected on an SAD ticket, Ghubaya is alleged to have good relations with Congress. His son Davinder Ghubaya was recently elected MLA from Fazilka on a Congress ticket. Sher Singh Ghubaya too has been spotted mingling with Congressmen in recent past after his ties with SAD chief Sukhbir Badal had soured before the assembly elections earlier this year. The two-time MP had vacated his assembly seat of Jalalabad for Sukhbir in 2009 and had won as MP on SAD ticket from Ferozepur parliamentary seat. He repeated his victory in 2014 but after that his relations with Sukhbir turned sour. In the February 4 assembly elections, Ghubaya had succeeded to get a Congress ticket from Fazilka assembly segment for his son though he remained in SAD. 
 
 Ghubaya said that, “I will vote on Monday in Delhi as per my conscience and in accordance with my people’s aspirations who want me to poll my vote but I cannot reveal as to whom I will vote for. My son is free to vote as per his conscience and I will not vote under any pressure and look for all options,” he said, adding that no leader from SAD had made any contact with him and so “I am free to poll my vote as per my choice”.
 
 SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said that though no whip had been issued for presidential elections but morally and ethically every MLA and MP belonging to the party must vote as per party choice. “We have a meeting of MLAs in Chandigarh and that of MPs in Delhi in the evening and the party will look into the aspect if anyone goes against party choice,” he added.
