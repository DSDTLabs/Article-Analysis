HYDERABAD: Even as authorities have announced the construction of 50 foot over bridges (FoB) across various locations in the city, pedestrians point to the lack of attention given to existing FoBs in the city, including the newly-inaugurated FoB at Road No 2 Banjara Hills.

 Escalators at a few FoBs don’t work, while at other locations, elevators are switched off by evening, say pedestrians.
 
 “The escalators and elevators at many FoBs in the city are not in working condition. The escalators at the L V   often do not work, forcing patients and pedestrians to climb the stairs to reach the bus stop on the other side. This causes major inconvenience to senior citizens who account for a majority of patients at the institute,” M Sai Kiran, a resident of Begumpet.
 
 Over 880 pedestrian deaths were recorded within Cyberabad limits in 2017, accounting for a whopping 37 per cent of road fatalities within the limit. Commuters said that walkways and FoBs for pedestrians could curb those statistics.
 
 “When I tried to make use of the newly-opened FoB at Road no 2 on Thursday evening, I found that the elevators were switched off. At the time of inauguration, it was promised that the elevators would work round the clock. The FoB is completely inaccessible to differently abled and elderly. Cutting off access to elevators and escalators beats the very purpose of building them. Authorities must ensure that existing FoBs are maintained, while building more pedestrian infrastructure,” said  , a commuter.
 
 The FoB opposite   was constructed at a cost of ?2.5 crore and opened to public in February.
