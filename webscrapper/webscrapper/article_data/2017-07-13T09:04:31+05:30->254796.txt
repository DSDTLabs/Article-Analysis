CHANDIGARH: With the Pakistan authorities denying the presence of   -- a native of Channa village in Ajnala -- in Pakistan jail, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday directed the Union government to explore all available possibilities to reunite him with his family.

 Nanak, then 5 years old, had strayed into Pakistani territory in 1984 while working in the fields near international border. There was no barbed wire fencing at the border then.
 
 A public interest litigation was filed before the   in 2016, seeking directions to bring back Nanak.
 
 During the hearing of the case on Wednesday, additional solicitor general,   produced a May 19 letter received from Pakistan’s ministry of external affairs denying the presence of Nanak at   in Pakistan. Jain informed the HC that as Pakistan has completely denied Nanak’s presence in its jail, the Centre cannot do anything.
