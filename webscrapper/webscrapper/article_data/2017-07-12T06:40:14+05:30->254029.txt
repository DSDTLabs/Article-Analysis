New Delhi: Following the terrorist   on Amarnath Yatra pilgrims, Not In My Name campaign protesters united against hatred and violence and mourned the loss of lives at   on Tuesday. The last vigil was organised hardly two weeks back to   the lynching of 17-year-old Junaid. 

 Few people turned up as the event was planned late on Monday night and due to the heavy downpour.

 Many activists from different rights groups were present at the vigil. Utkarsh Kumar, a businessman came to the protest right from his office. “We are not endorsing any religion or political agenda here but are present to fight for human rights,” he said. 
 
 Zaheeruddin, a businessman from Mustafabad held a banner saying ‘Hatred will not win’ and condemned the death of the pilgrims. “I was deeply saddened by the incident and came to the protest to share my pain for the victims,” said Zaheeruddin.
