LUCKNOW: Hours after SP general secretary   joined  , the party announced in Lucknow that it had maximum number of spare votes and it had to the first right on the 10th Rajya   seat from the state. 

 "We have 28 spare MLAs after electing 8 candidates, while BSP has just 19 legislators to support its candidate. So, to get a candidate elected, BSP needs 18 more votes while we need just nine. So, we are constituionally right in staking claim to our ninth seat. We are not violating any law," deputy CM   told TOI. A candidate needs 37 votes to sail through.
 
 This open claim by the ruling party, probably emboldened by Agarwal's arrival, has sent all three opposition parties BSP,   and   (SP) scurrying to protect their MLAs ahead of March 23 election. 
 
 SP has fielded Jaya Bachchan as its candidate and after ensuring her win, it would be left with 10 spare votes while Congress has seven MLAs. The two along with RLD and NISHAD Party (one MLA each) have pledged support to the BSP candidate.
 
 Sources in Congress said that party's UP chief Raj Babbar rushed to Delhi to meet his party leaders and ensure that none of their legislators were in touch with the BJP to vote in their favour. Two-time Kushinagar MLA and Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajay Kumar Lallu, too, had convened a meeting with senior Congress MLAs on Sunday, while issuing a verbal diktat on supporting the BSP's   candidate Bhim Rao Ambedkar.
 
 Fresh from the shock of their outgoing MP Naresh Aggarwal's induction into the BJP, SP too was busy keeping its flock together.
 
 Earlier, Maurya said that a rush of "development"" works his party has stood for under  's leadership and after electoral gains in the North East, BJP will "easily"will get the ninth MP. He did not comment if his party is already in touch with any of the Opposition parties.
