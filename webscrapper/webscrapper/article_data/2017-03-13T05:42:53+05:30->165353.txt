AHMEDABAD: For two days from March 16, nearly 40,000   employees will proceed on mass casual leaves to   against the governmentâ€™s failure to revise their   according to the seventh pay commission. Several bus routes towards Saurashtra and central Gujarat will be affected on these two days literally crippling the intra-state transport. 

  The   association have said that though ST drivers are employed under the class III category, they are paid salaries of class IV employees. Besides this, they have said, while fixed-pay employees in the drivers or conductors posts are paid class III salaries, their salaries are reduced to that of class IV employees when they are permanently employed with the state transport. 
 
 The workers unions of state transport have demanded the removal of these discrepancies. Another major demand of the employees is to stop privatization of bus stands and introduce the policy of employing immediate relatives of deceased state transport employees.
