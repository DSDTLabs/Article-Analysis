HYDERABAD: Hours after they embarked on an indefinite strike, members of Osmania University Teachers' Association (OUTA) called off their stir on Wednesday evening after the state government green-signalled the implementation of a contributory pension scheme (CPS) for OU teachers. 

 The decision, agitating teachers said, was taken after OU VC S   informed them that CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had signed the papers required to facilitate the implementation of the pension scheme.
 
 "We have decided to call off the strike as our problem has been resolved. The VC assured us that the CPS will be put in place for all teaching and non-teaching staff recruited on or after September 1, 2004, and the old pension scheme (OPS) will be implemented for those who joined the varsity between April 1, 2001, and August 31, 2004. He said the university has received a message from the CMO assuring that the paperwork for facilitating the implementation of the pension schemes has been completed," said  , president, OUTA.
 
 Earlier in the day, more than 250 teachers launched an indefinite strike and staged a dharna in front of OU's administrative building. They lashed out at the varsity for its indifferent attitude towards the implementation of government pension schemes.
 
 "We are happy that the state government has reacted on the first day of the protest. This decision was important as the varsity has introduced an LIC-linked pension scheme without any GO or approval of the varsity's executive council, adversely affecting all teaching and non-teaching staff," said B Manohar of the association.
 
 Under the LIC-linked scheme, reportedly introduced both at OU and JNTU, employees were expected to contribute 8.3% of their basic pay towards LIC with varsities not even shelling a single paisa.
