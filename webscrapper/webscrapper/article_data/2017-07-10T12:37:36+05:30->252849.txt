LUDHIANA: The   have identified more than 80 cops (in the rank of sub-inspectors, assistant sub-inspectors, and head constables) who will shortly receive their transfer orders. The cops slated for transfer are those who have been working in one police station for years together without being transferred. 

 The commissioner of police R$N Dhoke had sought a detailed report from deputy commissioner of police   in the matter. According to Dhoke, it was discovered that such cops developed a nexus and did not perform their duty efficiently.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Dhoke said: “A detailed report of the past five to ten years was sought from the DCP about the number of years all cops — including SIs, ASIs, and head constables — were posted in their current posting. In the report, we found that more than 80 cops were posted in same area for the past three to four years. 
 
 Now, what is wrong with this is that these cops created their nexus and did not take any action against   happening under their jurisdiction. However, my motive is to make the police more effective and accountable. Therefore, as of now, we are transferring SIs and ASIs out of that police station sub-division and zone.
 
  I have talked to all of them and told them that since they had been posted in the same police stations for several years, they would now be transferred to a place they had never been posted earlier.” He added that this would bring more efficiency, responsibility, and transparency in the police force. 
 
 The 80 cops chosen for transfer were out of a total of 285 SIs and ASIs. Importantly, police officials have also identified cops who have not been transferred from that police station even after promotion, and some were posted in the same zone for nine to ten years.
