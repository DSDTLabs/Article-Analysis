PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Chief minister   has directed the   Municipal Corporation ( ) to stop the work order for the civic contracts for door-to-door collection, transportation and dumping of garbage at the Moshi depot.

 “CM Fadnavis has stopped the work order for the garbage contracts. He has directed the municipal commissioner to study the contract and the rates. A government official too will study the contract. If any shortcomings are found, we will not hesitate even to re-invite the bids for these contracts,” said Laxman Jagtap, the BJP MLA from   and the party’s Pimpri Chinchwad unit president.
 
 “The rate given by PCMC to garbage collection and transportation contractor was Rs 1,800 per ton in the previous NCP rule. Now the PCMC has received the lowest rate of Rs 1,740 per ton. We will try to get an even lower rate,” Jagtap said.
 
 When contacted, PCMC commissioner   said, “I have received the information orally from the MLA. We have still not given any work order. We are still verifying the rates with government experts.”
 
 The civic body has divided the city into two parts and will allot one contractor for each of them for garbage collection and transportation. It expects the contractors to purchase their own vehicles and use their manpower for it. But opposition parties have criticized the ruling BJP and civic administration for approving the contracts.
 
 Rahul Kalate, the group leader of Shiv Sena corporators, said, “The method used for preparing the estimated cost of the projects is wrong.”
 
 Moreshwar Bhondwe, NCP member of the standing committee, said, “I have filed a petition in High Court. Four members of NCP and one Shiv Sena member had opposed the proposal, but the BJP approved it due to its majority.”
