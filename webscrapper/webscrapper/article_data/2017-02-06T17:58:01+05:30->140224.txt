 Miley Cyrus has apparently performed Lakshmi puja. 

  
  
 The 24-year-old songstress posted a picture on   where one can see a traditional Hindu prayer set-up with the Goddess of Wealth being worshipped, alongside an offering of fruits and halwa with incense sticks and diyas. 
 
 
  
 
 "#FruitBowl over Super... #offering," captioned the 'Wrecking Ball' singer, giving a light and healthy angle to the homely function in wake of the ongoing   2017. The picture also gives a sneak peek into Miley's spiritual side showing the photographs of gurus whom she perhaps follows. 
 The singer had also taken the services of a pundit to conduct the prayers.
