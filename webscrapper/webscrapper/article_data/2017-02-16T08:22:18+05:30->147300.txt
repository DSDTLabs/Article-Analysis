AMARAVATI: In a landmark move, the state government has decided to provide housing for all the government employees working in Amaravati. The government staff quarters will be constructed in G+8 apartments to accommodate 9,061 employees.

 The   (CRDA) will spare 139 acres for taking up the housing for the employees.
