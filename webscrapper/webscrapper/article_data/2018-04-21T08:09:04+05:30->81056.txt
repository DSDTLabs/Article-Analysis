Chandigarh: Punjab finance minister   Singh Badal on Friday said there was a need to upgrade cooperative   in the state, especially those in border areas, by producing byproducts like ethanol and liquor.

 He said this would create job and develop border areas economically. “A draft plan will be discussed in the next cabinet sub-committee meeting. We will formulate a long-term plan for the revival of sugar mills,” Manpreet said.
 
 The finance minister’s statement came after he presided over a cabinet sub-committee meeting on Friday. Forests and welfare of SCs and BCs minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and former minister   attended it. The sub-committee has been formed to look into proposals given by a “group of experts” for revival of loss-hit cooperative sugar mills in the state.
 
 The committee discussed a report presented by the group, which has been formed by the state government to give suggestions. During the meeting, there were suggestions that “only way” for the sugar industry to survive, in the prevailing circumstances in which there were major fluctuations in sugar and molasses prices, was to generate income from byproducts like ethanol. Experts also suggested converting cooperative sugar mills into sugar complexes in which ethanol, electricity and liquor could be produced.
 
 National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF) managing director   also gave a presentation on the global and Indian scenario in sugar industry.
 
 Additional chief secretary (cooperation) DP Reddy and additional chief secretary (development)   informed the committee that experts, after series of meetings with stakeholders, had drafted an exhaustive plan for upgrading and setting up distilleries for production of ethanol and to revive mills.
