BENGALURU: Cognizant’s employee strength in India fell by 8,000 in 2017, to a total of 180,000, according to the company’s latest filing with the US SEC. It’s not just a massive decline, it is perhaps also the first decline for India in the company’s history.

 
 It also stands in marked contrast to the big increases in the India headcount that it saw in the past four years – varying from a low of 10,200 in 2015 to 40,100 in 2014. Even in 2016, it had a headcount addition of 38,500.
 
 There were reports early last year indicating that the IT services company was looking to lay off 6,000 employees. The company itself announced a voluntary separation programme for senior executives and later said 400 had accepted the package.
 
 In the SEC filing,   said it incurred $53 million in severance costs, including those related to the voluntary separation programme.
 
 The company, however, is hiring more in other geographies. In 2017, it added 2,900 in North America, 2,300 in Europe, and 2,600 in other locations. The total number of employees in North America and Europe were 50,400 and 13,800 respectively. In 2016, its headcount in North America had gone up by 6,700. Clearly, Cognizant is moving more of its people closer to the customer.
 
 “In 2017, we began a realignment of our business to accelerate the shift to digital services and solutions while improving the overall efficiency of our operations,” the SEC filing said.
 
 In digital services, certain skills are required closer to the customer. Early last year, presumably referring to these skills, chief financial officer Karen McLoughlin told analysts in a call that there was no big price differential for the same set of skills while hiring onshore.
 
 The employee realignment has reduced the India employee strength as a proportion of total employee strength to 69% in 2017, from 74% in 2014. 
 
 Most IT services companies do not break up their employee strength by geography, but many of them are believed to be seeing similar trends.
 
 
 
 
 Cognizant incurred $36 million in costs related to the FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) investigation and related lawsuits in 2017. This is in addition to the $27 million it incurred in 2016 on the same matter, taking the total so far to $63 million. The company said it expects to continue to incur expenses related to these matters this year. 
 
 In 2016, it voluntarily notified to the US department of justice and the SEC that the company was investigating payments related to company-owned facilities in India that were possibly made improperly and in violation of FCPA and other applicable laws.
