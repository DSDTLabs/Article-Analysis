Pune: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has started a system to issue tickets with the transport body’s complaint number (020-24503355) printed on them.

 PMPML CMD Tukaram Mundhe has stressed on prompt response to complaints, a senior official told TOI. The fresh move will give a broader platform to the passengers to immediately call up and register their complaints.
 
 “Many people are not aware about the complaint number. The move will ensure that passengers dissatisfied with any service of the transport body, will not have to wait long to file a complaint,” a senior official, requesting anonymity, said.
 
 The PMPML also has a mobile application ‘Fixi PMPML’ to file complaints.
 
 Sunday a workday
 
 With steps being taken to streamline PMPML services, Sunday was not a holiday for some senior officials. Presiding over a meeting of ticket checkers and other staff at Swargate depot, general manager (operations) Anant Waghmare briefed the officials about the instructions from Mundhe. A decision on forming a special surveillance squad has also been taken.
 
 Nine staffers suspended
 
 On instructions of the CMD, PMPML officials conducted a surprise check at different depots on Saturday night. It was found that nine people were sleeping during duty hours and they were suspended. Earlier five staff members who had reported late for duty had been suspended. As many as 117 employees had seen a salary cut for a day on March 31 for reporting late to duty.
