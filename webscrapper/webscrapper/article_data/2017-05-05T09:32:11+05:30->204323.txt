 The officials further said that the new rules that have been notified by the government make it clear that charging fees for two quarters together will be considered ‘collection of capitation fee’. Schools that charge fee for two quarters together shall be liable for penal action for violation of the Act. The committees have the power to take such action.
 
 The fee regulation panels will also determine the interim fee which shall be binding on the self-financed schools till the revision application is finally decided by the Fee Revision Committee. In the event of increase in fees by the Fee Revision Committee, the self-financed school shall be permitted to collect the additional amount from the student in the next quarter.
