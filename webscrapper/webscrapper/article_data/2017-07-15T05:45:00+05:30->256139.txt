Nagpur: Physical education teachers in schools and junior colleges have threatened to boycott all government sports tournaments as part of their protest over a cut in ‘teaching hours’. According to PE teachers’ associations, their hours were slashed in half from this academic year. 

 Pramod Charmode, secretary of the Maharashtra State Secondary and Higher Secondary Physical Education Teachers Association (MPETA), said they will protest “till the government restores our teaching hours”. “It is difficult to complete the syllabus in four-hour lectures per week and now they have reduced it to two.” 
 
 State school education minister Vinod Tawde told TOI that he will be meeting the physical education teachers on Monday. “I am confident that an amicable solution will be found.” 
 
 On Friday, members MPETA and CBSE School’s Staff Welfare Association (CSSWA) addressed a press conference slamming the government over the resolution issued on April 28 that led to their hours being cut.
 
 Indrajeet Basu, president of CSSWA, said “Students will suffer because of this action.”
 
 The physical education teachers also alleged that as their lecture time is reduced, some schools are also allotting them regular subjects to teach. “At many schools, physical education teachers are being asked to teach science and mathematics, it is totally wrong. The state must go back to the old rules. We want to create sportsmen,” said Sachin Deshmukh, the joint secretary of the MPETA.
 
 Members of the association also held a meeting at the Divisional Sports Complex at Mankapur to discuss their strategy. They wore black arm bands to register their protest.
