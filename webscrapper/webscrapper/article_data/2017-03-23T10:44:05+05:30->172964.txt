 CWC member Srikant Kumar said, "We have been observing the boy and woman claiming to be his mother for a few days now. When we realised that the child has not been going to school and looked intoxicated almost all the time, we decided to take him for counselling."
 
 The child, Kumar said, said the woman was not his real mother and refused to go back with her. "The boy claimed that his mother left him with this woman a long time ago and since then he has been living with her. He said he did not like staying with her and wanted to go to school," the CWC member said.
 
 However, the woman claimed she was the boy's biological mother and did not send him to school because she was alone and could not afford to do without her son.
 
 CWC and district child protection officer (DCPO) has sent the child to the state shelter home Balashray for now.
 
 Srikant said, "We will investigate whether this woman was really her mother or not. If it is proved that she is the real mother, we will give her the child and ensure he is sent to school. If she is not his mother, we will start a rehabilitation procedure for the child and lodge a complaint against the woman."
