Bharuch: Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday that the road transport and highways ministry will be spending Rs two lakh crore for the road development in Gujarat till the the government term ends in in 2019.

 He also slammed the Congress-led UPA goverment for delaying the construction of new bridge on Narmada on Tuesday.
 
 “Tender for the new bridge was awarded in 2012 by the UPA government to Hindustan Construction Company at the cost of Rs 475 crore. The company failed to start the work in stipulated time. When we came to power in 2014, the work was awarded to Larsen and Toubro (L&T) at the cost of Rs 375 crore,” he said, during the inauguration of the cable-stayed bridge. 
 
 “This is the longest extradosed cable-stayed bridge in India and it has been constructed in a record time of 36 months,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel conveyed his best wishes to the people of Bharuch for the new bridge.
 
 Meanwhile, pictures of the the foundation stone laying ceremony done in presence of Gadkari’s predecessor, CP Joshi and Ahmed Patel went viral on the social media. Congress workers sent out messages on social media taking the credit for the cable-stayed bridge and criticized Modi for not inviting Ahmed Patel for the inauguration.
 
 Nazu Fadwala, spokesman for Bharuch Congress said, " Though BJP is trying to take credit, people of Bharuch know what role of Ahmed Patel has played for this new bridge. Nevertheless, it is good that people will finally get relief from the daily traffic jams.”
