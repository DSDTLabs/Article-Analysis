PANAJI: Reclamation of a narrow strip of cultivable land along the   road by way of dumping of mud has been on since December 2017. The patch is one of the last paddy fields in the area and has been lying fallow for decades.

 The   that commenced more than two months ago is being carried out blatantly on the sea side of the Miramar-Dona Paula road. The stretch still has undulating sand dunes, which are likely to be buried or destroyed after the reclamation is used.
 
 While authorities have not initiated any action, the corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP) officials said that they are unaware about the reclamation. “We are not aware about it nor has anybody approached us with a complaint,” CCP mayor,   said.
 
 The partly reclaimed stretch on the Caranzalem road’s western side is near a private property popularly known as  . 
 
 A board fixed in the area referred to the property ownership.“The mud filling started on a weekend, but continues blatantly,” a local resident said.
 
 As per Section 17 (A) of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1974, no land filling in low lying paddy field is permitted. The area is close to the high tide line (HTL), though the exact distance from it is difficult to assess due to beach vegetation. Sources, however, said the plot is less than 200m from the HTL.The   beach stretch had a large dune field. Part of it still survives, but increasing footfalls and illegal burning of vegetation often exposes the dunes to erosion.
