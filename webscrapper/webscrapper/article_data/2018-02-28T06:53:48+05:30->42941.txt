LUCKNOW: There was no end to the deadlock between   and   despite a meeting between the two sides on Tuesday.
 
 
  officials on Tuesday appeared before an LU committee which is investigating allegations of irregularities in the college’s self-finance courses. The university panel, however, was not satisfied with the college’s explanation.
 
 “The college officials did not furnish any information about the self-finance courses and refused to acknowledge complaints against the college,” said dean of the college development cell RR Yadav.
 
 
 He said any decision on action against the college would be considered after a meeting of university officials.
 
 
 Meanwhile, IT College principal   said LU was unable to validate complaints against them.
 
 
 “We had asked the university under which provision it had sought information about our courses, but got no reply.”
 
 
 “LU had claimed that some guardians of students of IT College had raised complaints. But the names of guardians provided by the university did not match with our records,” she added.
 
 
 “We had also asked for the names of our students so that we could meet them and hear their grievances. But the university failed to provide any names,” the principal said.
 
 
 “It’s seems strange that students approached LU instead of their college. This raises doubt whether such complainants are bonafide students,” she said.
