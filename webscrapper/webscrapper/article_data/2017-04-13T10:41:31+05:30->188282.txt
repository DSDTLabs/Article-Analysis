MUMBAI: The schoolgirl who was grievously hurt after a 2kg griddle fell on her head continues to be in a comatose condition nearly two weeks after the incident. The plight of   (8) has caught the attention of Samaritans world over who have approached the hospital to support her treatment.

 A woman from the US contacted Hazequa's  , Dr  , to aid her recovery. “The lady was extremely concerned. She has assured that she would want to take care of her entire treatment,“ said Dr Turel. He said the family has been approached by people from all over the country.
 
 Hazequa is admitted to the ICU of Bombay Hospital. An MRI test showed injury in deeper parts of the brain. Dr Turel said a big step would be to operate on her and remove the broken part of the skull that has entered the brain. “It will minimize chances of infection,“ he said. The surgery could happen soon.
 
 On the positive side, the child has been responding to pain. “We hope she will come out of coma shortly,“ the doctor said.
