NEW DELHI: A sub-divisional magistrate has found serious lapses on the part of a private school in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar during an inquiry to establish whose negligence led to the rape of a five-year-old girl at the school, allegedly by a peon. 

 The SDM’s report has been submitted by revenue minister Kailash Gahlot to deputy chief minister   for further action.
 
 After the case was reported, the Delhi government directed SDM of Vivek Vihar to conduct an inquiry. 
 
 In the report, the SDM cited serious lapses in the functioning of the school. “Unhindered access was given to the accused to all the areas of the school. The accused was working for the school, though a formal appointment letter does not appear to have been issued. The movement of the accused, and other such non-teaching employees, was required to be restricted so that he does not have any contact with the schoolchildren,” the report states. “The accused had been working at the school for almost 2.5 years without undergoing any kind of verification and background check by the school authorities/police,” it points out.
 
 The report said the nursery classroom where the rape occurred should have been locked after the class timings were over. “(The) unlocked, pitch-dark classroom of the school facilitated the accused in his nefarious intentions,” the report says. It adds there was a “reduced deterrence effect” because the   cameras did not cover the entire school building.
 
 The SDM’s report says the “EDMC has not taken any action against the school for undertaking classes in unrecognised areas of the school building. The last safety audit was conducted by the school inspector of   in December 2016. However, the safety audit report does not have any parameters with regard to the police verification of employees, installation of CCTV cameras, entry/exit restrictions for unauthorised people, etc.”
