PUNE: Somewhere in the city, a group of children are intrigued by the colour of different flowers, leaves, stones and other natural things they see every day while playing outside. Their curiosity takes them on a quest — to find where these colours come from. Elsewhere, another group of children attending a tuition class discover their heavy bags were leaving them tired.

 These two scenarios were the topics of documentaries by two Pune school students that were screened at the 8th National Science Film Festival of India, in Guwahati, in February.
 
 Pradnya Datar’s Colours of Nature and Nandita Nachare’s School Bag were among the 82 shortlisted films, under five categories, that were screened at the festival. Datar and Nachare are both students of M S   and were trained in filmmaking at a city-based institute.
 
 “In my film, the children collect leaves that have different colours — yellow, green, red and pink. They then researched the source of these various colours. The children ask their teachers and read books on the topic. They finally reach the conclusion that leaves contain chlorophyll that gives them their colour,” said Datar, who is in Class VI.
 
 Nachare’s School Bag sees children perform experiments using balls, string and a rod to conclude that their heavy bags were to blame for their tiredness.
 
 Around 300 filmmakers and students of different institutes from all across the country and abroad had participated in this mega event. As many as 17 films from the countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and   were also screened.
