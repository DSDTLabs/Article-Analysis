 users across the world sent 75 billion messages on New Year’s Eve, the app said in a statement on Thursday. Of these, 20 billion were from India, the Facebook-owned platform’s biggest market with over 200 million monthly active users. The New Year’s Eve messages included over 13 billion images and five billion videos. “New Year’s Eve was WhatsApp’s biggest messaging day ever,” the statement said. This New Year’s Day, WhatsApp suffered a global outage for about an hour.
