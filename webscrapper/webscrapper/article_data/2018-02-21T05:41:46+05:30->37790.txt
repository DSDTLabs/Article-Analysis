MUMBAI: A slum-dweller has been arrested for allegedly duping several home buyers of Rs 10 crore by promising them affordable homes. The accused, Madhukar   (48), a resident of   slums in   (east), had promised to develop plots in Malad, Borivli and  , said officials from the the economic offences wing (EOW) of the city police.

 He had formed an organisation, Samyak Nivas Haqqa Sangh, and rented out an office in Parel in 2010, said a senior EOW official. He publicised his ‘scheme’ by word of mouth.
 
 “Suryavanshi offered a one-room kitchen for Rs 3 lakh while he quoted Rs 5 lakh for a 1-BHK. Flat buyers were asked to make an initial deposit of 10% of the value by cheque or cash. More than 700 investors had paid him,” said a senior EOW official.
 
 To make his claims appear credible, he had even taken a few buyers to a “construction site” in in Titwala. “He had bought the land by using the investors’ money,” said the officer.
 
 As construction work stopped eventually, those who had made part payment started visiting Suryavanshi’s office, which he eventually shut down to avoid them.
 
 Unable to get their flats or the money back, investors had lodged a complaint of cheating against Suryavanshi on November 28, 2014. When the police began probing the case, they did not find him anywhere and it was only a few months back that the police learnt that Suryavanshi had been lodged in Harsul jail near Aurangabad for three similar frauds he had allegedly committed there.
 
 He was taken into custody by the Mumbai police. Cases have aslo been registered against him in Pune, Ahmednagar and Satara.
 
 The EOW has invoked sections of the stringent Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act and produced Suryavanshi before a court. He has been sent to police custody till Febraury 23.
