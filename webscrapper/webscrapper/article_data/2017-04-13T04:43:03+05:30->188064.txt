NEW DELHI: Even as   distanced itself from the pro-EVM views of its senior member and former law minister   and reiterated that they were being tampered with, the party faced more embarrassment with another senior leader picking hole in its stance on Wednesday.

 As a united opposition met President   with EVMs among the list of grievances on Wednesday, Punjab chief minister   said, “If EVMs were fixed then I wouldn’t be sitting here. The Akalis would be.” Congress swept the Punjab polls by ousting Akali Dal, an ally of BJP, from office.
 
 within Congress over the stand on manipulation of EVMs, an issue that the opposition has made the leitmotif of its attack on BJP after the saffron party’s massive victories in UP and Uttarakhand.
 
 Unfazed by the differing voices, leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said Congress and the opposition are united in their belief that EVMs were being manipulated and they had “concrete evidence” from polls in Maharashtra and UP.
 
 In a chat with TOI, Moily had questioned on Tuesday the wisdom of Congress in meeting the EC to demand that voting in future be done again on ballot papers. Moily said complaints about EVMs were also made during the UPA regime but it was found that the machines couldn’t be manipulated.
 
 Faced with questions about Moily’s remarks, Azad said, “We have concrete evidence and we met the EC, which said it will call an all-party meeting and also inquire into the issue.”
 
 Azad said the opposition is united in their view that “something is wrong with EVMs” and any Congress leader talking otherwise was only expressing his “individual opinion”.
 
 Interestingly, after his comments in TOI, Moily was taken into the team which discussed the draft of the memorandum to the President and also signed the memorandum besides visiting Rashtrapati Bhavan, in what appeared to be an attempt to dispel the impression of a difference of opinion within.
