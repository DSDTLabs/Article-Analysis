Actor  , who featured on   when she was just 23, said director   told her to avoid plastic surgery on her face. Reportedly, the 50-year-old said she is grateful to the director for the advice.

  
  
 When I was 23, right before a close-up on 'Jurassic Park', Spielberg said to me, "People will tell you what you could do to your face years from now. Don't you ever touch your face."
 
 "He was saying, 'Your face is perfect, it's female, it's emotional'. I am determined to be human in my acting, and when you own your power and your womanhood, you grow into your beauty. Your face finds you."
