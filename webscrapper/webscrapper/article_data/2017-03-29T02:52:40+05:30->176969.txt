KOLKATA: A woman sub-inspector of police returning to her home at Radha Madhav Dutta Lane in   near Subhas Sarobar at 11pm on Monday was followed by a group of men who passed   at her and threatened her when she objected. 

 Two people were arrested on Tuesday after she lodged a complaint. “The officer alleged the accused were passing remarks at her. Accordingly, we arrested Abir Sikdar and Gopal Chakraborty. They were charged under Section 509 IPC (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman),” said DC (ESD) Debasmita Das.
 
 The spot where the incident took place is within a two-kilometre radius of both Beliaghata police station and the DC East Suburban office.
 
 The incident comes a week after a Phoolbagan police station constable’s chain was snatched when she was returning home in the evening after duty. 
 
 According to some Beliaghata residents, Sikdar and Chakraborty were also involved with a chain snatching gang, but the Beliaghata cops denied it.
