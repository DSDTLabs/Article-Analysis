CHENNAI: The Class XII pass percentage in the state dipped for the first time since 2011 this year, but the figure for   remains on an upward curve. The overall pass percentage has improved to 94.5% this year — a marginal increase of 0.1%. Chennai district’s performance too gave reasons to cheer as its pass percentage rose from 93.8% last year to 94.2% this year.

 
 A total of 10.01 lakh students including 8.6 lakh school candidates appeared for the   (SSLC) exams, the results of which were declared on Wednesday. However, the number of students taking the exams dwindled by nearly 25,000 this year. Nearly 96.4% of girls and 92.5% of boys cleared the exams that were held between March 16 and April 20. Sivaganga district topped the state with an overall pass percentage of 98.5% while Erode and Virudhunagar secured the second and third spots by recording 98.38% and 98.29%.
 
  
  
 
 
 Only 0.99% of students fell in the bracket of those scoring in the highest range of 481 and above out of 500. Meanwhile, the biggest chunk of students (38.5%) have scored in the range of 301to 400. More than 2.6 lakh students have scored more than 400 out of 500 this year.
 
 Schooleducation minister KA Sengottaiyan said nearly 5,500 schools have secured 100% pass. With the state abolishing the rank system from last year, he also warned schools which tried to promote admissions by advertising toppers.
 
 Thedrop in the number of students taking the exams is a pattern that has been seen over the past few years. Since 2015, the numbers have been falling every year – in a matter of four years, the drop has been more than a lakh.
 
 R Visalakshi, president of the Private School Association, said there could be an overall drop in enrolments across classes and not necessarily at just the Class X level. She said many students may have migrated to other boards after the implementation of Samacheer Kalvi (uniform education). Also, there has been a mushrooming of CBSE schools, she added.
 
 Schools too said that with the implementation of Samacheer leading to a fall in standards, and “over-regulation” of fees and other charges levied by the fee committee, there was no incentive for many matriculation schools to encourage more students.
 
 “The growth in matriculation schools has not been significant over the past few years. Several matriculation schools too push students toward their CBSE branches and this could have led to the drop in numbers,” said a representative of a matriculation school.
