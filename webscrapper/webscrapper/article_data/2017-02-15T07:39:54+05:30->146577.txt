KOLKATA: To stop the supply of rickety bicycles to Class X-XII students at government schools under   scheme, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has asked chief secretary   to float fresh tenders and place orders with a company that will give a three-year guarantee. 

 A state secretariat source said the CMO had been receiving complaints about poor cycles supplied over the past few months. "The CM took initiative to find out the veracity of the allegations and asked Banerjee and backward classes welfare minister   to look into the matter," a Nabanna official said. But Mahato declined to comment. "I have not received any complaint but we will look into the matter if we get any grievance," he said.
