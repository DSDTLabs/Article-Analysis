MELBOURNE:  's hands went up in celebration the moment Croat Jana Fett's two-hander drifted into the net. In the stands, her fiancé, basketballer David Lee thumped his hands, relief written all over his face. The 27-year-old second seed scripted a stirring comeback win on Wednesday, saving two match points and clawing back from 1-5 in the third set against the 21-year-old.

 
 
 
 Wozniacki, looking for her first Grand Slam title, came through 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in a match in which her free-swinging opponent slammed 39 winners. Down 1-5, 15-40, she was all but out of the tournament. The Dane, superbly fit, pairing a cropped tee with an A-line skirt, fittingly called it one of her best comeback efforts.
 
 
 
 "I'm very proud of the way I came back. It was definitely difficult, definitely wasn't my best match, especially in the beginning. It was very different conditions. I just tried to mentally stay focused, tried to play my game. She was playing really well," Wozniacki said.
 
 "At 5-1, 40-15, she served a great serve down the T. It was just slightly out. I was kind of lucky. Then I felt her tighten up just slightly. I thought to myself, at this point, make her win it, don't give it to her. When I managed to push to 5-2, I said, I'm still alive. She still has four more balls to win in a row or in the game. I was like, try and stay aggressive and that was that."
 
 Wozniacki, who finished 2017 in spectacular fashion winning the WTA Finals in Singapore and shortly after announced her engagement, was seeded 20 the last time round in Melbourne Park. The striking Dane - who endured a public break-up with her then fiancé, golfing star Rory Mccllroy some four years ago - struggled not just emotionally and mentally at the time, but also had to deal with a series of injuries.
 
 "I'm feeling happy, content off the court, everything is going great. It helps me play better on the court. I don't have any worries. I just kind of do my thing," Wozniacki, who'll play Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens on Friday, said. "All I think about is the yellow ball, the net, and the lines. It just makes everything much simpler. It's great to know I have that amazing support. It makes a huge difference to me."
 
 
 
 About the time Wozniacki got out of jail in her second round match-up, 15th-seeded Frenchman   battled back from 2-5 down in the decider to beat the Canada's 18-year-old shotmaker Denis Shapovalov 3-6, 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 in 3 hours and 37 minutes
 
 The 32-year-old, who had lost his only previous meeting to the teenager in the second round of the US Open, said he was hot on his opponent's chase from the word go. "Since the start I was behind him. I had to fight a lot and make him finish the match. He never did! That's good for me," he said. "The most important for me, it's to fight, give my best on court until the last point. That's what I did today. I think he deserved to win also today, but I was also courageous, I deserve it too."
 
 Shapovalov, athletic and a tremendous striker of the ball, including his single-fisted backhand, tested the Frenchman, bringing the fight out of him. "When your body is hurt, your mind is hurt, too. I felt a lot better at the end than the start. I start pretty slow. We came from the locker room where the atmosphere is nice and pleasant, and you go in the heat. It's tough for me," Tsonga said. "Next time when I have to play in these conditions, I have to be a little bit more ready than what I did today."
 
 Next up for the Frenchman is the 17th-seeded Aussie Nick Kyrgios, who ousted Serbia's Victor Troicki 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).
 
 Top-seeded   put out Argentine Leonardo Mayer 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4); Sixth-seeded Croat   ousted Portugal's Joao Souza 6-1, 7-5, 6-2. Women's fourth-seed   rallied to beat Czech Katerina Siniakova 4-6, 6-2, 6-1; French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko beat China's Ying-Ying Duan 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
