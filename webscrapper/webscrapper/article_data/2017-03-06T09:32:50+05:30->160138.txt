JAISALMER: Sleuths of state intelligence agencies have several incriminating evidences against suspected ISI operatives   and his nephew Vinod. The sleuths have found out that the duo was involved in providing details related to movement of Indian security forces along the border districts in October and November 2016.

 “All through the months of October and November last year, the entire border region was buzzing with activities. The Indian security forces were extra vigilant and Satram and Vinod were asked to go to these border areas and give reports about the movement of Indian troops,” an intelligence official said.
 
 Satram and his nephew Vinod were arrested in Barmer and Jodhpur, respectively, for their alleged ties with   ISI. The police said that the duo have been brought to Jaipur for further interrogation.
 
 “Satram came to India from Pakistan and became a citizen in 2008. Two years ago he also brought his nephew to India on sponsorship. Satram was a regular visitor to Pakistan. During one of his visits, he was contacted by an   who offered Satram money for espionage,” the official said.
 
 The sleuths of Rajasthan police’s border intelligence wing has found that duo was on the radar of security agencies ever since the cops arrested   last month in the same connection.
 
 The sleuths said that ever since the arrests of ISI’s western Rajasthan module of spies, the espionage activities has become dormant. “For the first time in past several years so many Pakistani operatives have been arrested. This has given a major shock to our counterparts across the border,” the officials said.
