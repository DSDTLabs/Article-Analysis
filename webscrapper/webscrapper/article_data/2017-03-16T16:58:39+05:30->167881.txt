Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s period drama ‘Padmavati’ starring 
 , 
  and 
  in lead roles has been in the news ever since it was announced. And it looks like Shahid has already worked his magic on the maverick filmmaker. According to reports, the ‘
 ’ actor is in talks with Bhansali’s production house for another film after the magnum opus. 

 The film in question is apparently a light-hearted rom-com with a lot of dancing. According to sources, Shahid has heard the script and liked it. However, he will sit down for a final narration before he signs on the dotted line. Titled ‘Tuesdays and Fridays’, the movie will reportedly be produced by Bhansali with a new director at the helm of affairs.
 
 It may be recollected that Shahid, for a long time, featured in light-hearted commercial entertainers before he started experimenting with more serious roles in films like ‘Kaminey’ and ‘Haider’. It sure will be interesting to see Sasha return to this genre after a string of serious films.
