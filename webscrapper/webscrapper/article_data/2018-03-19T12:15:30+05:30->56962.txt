Rappers   and   are reportedly teaming up in Wyoming for new  .

  
  
 Both rappers are staying at the   luxury hotel and resort under an alias, and have each brought a huge crew with them. Drake's team includes his engineer, songwriter and his personal photographer/videographer, sources told media.
 
 Big names like hip-hop artiste Lil Uzi Vert are there too along with a slew of major producers who work with Kanye and Drake.
 
 Sources said the rappers brought a ton of audio and recording equipment with them, most likely to set up their own studio at Kanye's place because he is staying at a separate house at the resort away from the main hotel.
