PANAJI: The district and subordinate court complex at  , being built at an expense of Rs 120 crore by   (GSIDC), is likely to be completed by March 31, 2021.

 GSIDC officials said they are attempting to complete the project by December 2020, failing which it will be ready by March 2021. While cabinet approval for the project was granted in June 2017, the original completion date had been set for October 2018.
 
 Law minister Francis D’Souza said the high court of Bombay at Goa is monitoring the project’s progress, and have been clearing the contractor’s payments regularly. “The project was delayed as it underwent some changes, and some permits were not taken when it was initiated in October 2016,” said a GSIDC official. Moreover, in October 2017, the contractor had stopped work over non-opayment of dues, leading to further delays and postponement of the completion date.
 
  CM Manohar Parrikar had earlier told the media that GSIDC had not obtained permission from the expenditure and finance committee (EFC) before starting the project. EFC approval is mandatory for all ventures costing over Rs 15 crore. In the absence of EFC approval, payments could not be made to the contractor, thus bringing work to a standstill.
 
 The town and country planning ( ) department’s clearance was received in September 2016 on payment of infrastructure tax of Rs 34.36 crore, while the conversion sanad was received in December 2017.
 
 GSIDC officials said delays in obtaining the environmental impact assessment (EIA) further slowed down the project’s progress.
