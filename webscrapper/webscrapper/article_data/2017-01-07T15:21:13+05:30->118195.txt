BHUBANESWAR: The   (SSM), an outfit of villagers within the   (STR), on Friday protested against their alleged forcible relocation by the district administration. 

 Addressing a news conference here, the outfit alleged that the action is in violation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, and Wildlife Protection (amendment) Act, 2006.
 
 The outfit alleged that the   district administration along with wildlife authorities have so far relocated nearly 200 villagers of Jenabill, Jamunagarh and Kabatghai located in the critical core area of the STR. In return, the administration gave Rs 10 lakh to each family for relocation. The relocated villagers are also promised 10 decimal homestead land and one pucca house under Biju Kutir Yojana.
 
 Sama Sidu, a resident of Khejuri village in the buffer zone, said the district administration passes proposal on relocation of villagers without their consent. Stating that the outfit would continue protest against their relocation, the villagers said the STR can be better protected when tribals and wildlife live together as ever. 
 
 Green campaigner Prafulla Samantara, who also attended the news conference, said the Mayurbhanj district administration along with the NGOs is taking advantage of innocence of tribals in the area. 
 
 When contacted, STR deputy director   said there was no truth in the allegation regarding of violation of FRA due to the relocation. "The entire relocation process is being carried out only after the consent of the villagers in the gram sabhas. The forest settlers have been given all the rights that have been laid down in the forest Act."
