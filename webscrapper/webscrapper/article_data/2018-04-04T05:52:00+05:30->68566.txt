NOIDA: A four-year-old girl was pulled back from certain death by her mother on Tuesday morning after the child fell into an open   while waiting for her school bus and got briefly swallowed by the cesspool.

 Not even a minute before that,   Mehra had felt Sirisha’s little fingers slide out of her palm and turned towards her daughter to see her absorbed in conversation with a kindergarten classmate. It was 7.30am and they were all waiting for the school bus, just outside the gates of  , a residential society in Sector 74.
 
 Then a car speeding past suddenly honked near Sirisha and the startled child took a few steps back. The open manhole was right behind her and she fell. Sukriti lunged instinctively to grab her daughter but the girl had been sucked entirely into the murky water because of the fall. When she rose back near the surface, her mother caught hold of her hand and pulled with all the strength she could muster.
 
 “She was deep into the water and only one hand was visible,” Sukriti, whose daughter studies in The Manthan School, told TOI later at the district child hospital, Sirisha by her side, clutching at her mother’s dupatta and tying and untying knots with it. The experience had obviously affected her young mind but physically, at least, there were only minor bruises on her back and legs. 
 
 “I tried to pull her up but wasn’t able to rescue her by myself and cried out for help. Pankaj, a Capetown resident who was at the spot, came to my rescue and he almost went inside the manhole and pulled Sirisha by her hands,” Sukriti said. The sewage level in the manhole was about two feet from the surface.
 
 Like Sukriti, Pankaj Kukreti was also waiting for the school bus. “I heard a scream and saw a woman leaning into the manhole. I ran and found her holding a child’s hand. I grabbed hold of the child’s other hand and we managed to pull her out,” Kukreti said. He said the manhole, which was sealed after this incident, was open for the last 3-4 months.
 
 Later in the day, a case was filed under Section 336 of IPC (endangering life or personal safety of others) at the Sector 49 police station against Noida Authority, the security agency of Capetown and Supertech, the developer of Capetown. 
 
 A Noida Authority official said the area did come under its jurisdiction, but claimed the manhole was left open after the developer undertook some work there. R K Mishra, ACEO of Noida, said, “We found the developer had opened the manhole for some work. The manhole’s cover was also found at the spot. We have served the developer a notice seeking an explanation,” he said.
 
 Supertech, however, claimed it had nothing to do with it. “Supertech has no involvement in this. This incident took place on the main road, it is the responsibility of the authority to maintain it. They took action after they were informed,” a spokesperson for the company said. Capetown chief estate manager Tapan Das added, “The area has been barricaded and we have deployed a queue guard on the spot.”
 
 Sirisha’s father Ashish owns a private company – APM Infratech – which is a Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation vendor. Mehra said he had gone out cycling when his wife and daughter were waiting for the school bus. “They were standing some 20 metres from the society’s main entrance. Sirisha stepped back for safety because of a honking car and fell into the open manhole,” he said.
 
 Ashish said when he reached, around 40 Capetown residents were already there. “My daughter was covered in muck from head to toe. I am thankful to all those who helped saved my daughter,” he said. Among them was Praveen Manikpuri, who helped clean the child and soothe her nerves. “The child was scared. I helped clean her up and counselled her,” said Manikpuri. Both said none of the society’s guards had come forward to help. 
 
 The family filed a police complaint against the developer and Noida Authority officials for negligence. “The police should investigate why the manhole was left open,” Ashish said. “Officials must take appropriate action to avoid such incidents in future,” said Sukriti.
 
 In neighbouring Ghaziabad, two four-year-old boys died in a gap of just two days last month after falling into an open drain. An FIR had been registered against officials of Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation in one of the deaths.
