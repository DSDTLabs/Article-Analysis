Every single person who turned up for this party had his/her share of fun, for it was high on music, dance, food, fashion and what not! When our photog dropped in at this pub, he spotted many cheerful and bubbly ones. Undoubtedly, peeps like Sheldon and Mojo were in their fashionable best and together they appeared quite photogenic. Rahul and Carol gave animated poses for the shutterbugs, whereas, Rekha posed next to a vintage scooter displayed at the pub. The trio — Megha, Harsh and Pallavi — were in high spirits and together they shook a leg in sync with the DJ’s peppy music. The others were happy about catching up with friends and indulging in delectable eats.
