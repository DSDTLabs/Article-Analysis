CHENNAI:   in Tamil Nadu may be celebrating that they don’t have to write the re-exam but for several   and parents, it is only leading to more apprehensions about entrance tests, delayed results and college admissions being affected.

 
 “I have to travel to Bangalore for a selection interview in a university which has dates from April 22 to 25. Now, with the economics exam right around the same time, it clashes with preparations and is only making me more nervous,” said Samhita, a student. Another parent said that the family has to travel outside of the city for an entrance test in the same week which is only making them feel concerned about the dates and performance in both the entrance test and the exam. 
 
 Already, students are affected regarding preparing for entrance tests that are coming up in a week’s time. For Class XII students, IIT Humanities entrance will be held on April 15, while   is on April 8 (online mode) and April 15-16 (offline mode).
 
 The extended exam date is also a cause of worry for parents as the results may get further delayed than usual.   are normally announced much after the state board results, leading to a section of students losing out on the first lot of seats being allotted during admissions in the UG level.
 
 Shalini Srinath, a parent, felt that the education departments across states should be sensitive to this possible delay in results due to the re-exam and ask colleges to ensure a fair deal in admissions for students across different boards. A faculty member of   said, “There are colleges which carry out an admission round following CBSE results. While we can’t reserve seats, we give a 10-day window for them once their results are out.”
