 and   have decided to cancel their movie ' ' after Ryan Murphy announced the similar project on the Italian designer. 

 Last year at Berlin film festival, Bille revealed he was prepping a biopic of Versace and Banderas would star in the movie. 
 
  
  
 But last fall another   project was announced when Murphy decided he would focus his incredibly popular "American Crime Story" series on Versace's murder. 
 
 The high-profile cast includes Edgar Ramirez as Gianni Versace, Ricky Martin as his boyfriend Antonio D'Amico, Penelope Cruz as Donatella and Darren Criss as serial killer Andrew Cunanan. 
 
 In an interview , "Actually I saw Bille at Cannes film festival. Because there was a TV show going on, that actually my friend Penelope is doing, we looked at each other and said 'this movie doesn't make sense anymore'." 
 
 "I have to confess now I don't think I am Gianni. I met him in the house where he was killed, actually, a couple of times. He was a very shy man, very laid back, beautiful, very sweet, but there was something about him that I don't have."
