NEW DELHI: Urging   to ensure smooth functioning of  , Vice-President M   on Sunday asked lawmakers to move away from the “environment of settling scores”.

 
 “We should move away from the current environment of settling scores in which each party adopts the strategy of ‘I disrupt because you have done it before’. Can we end this spiral? I think we can and we should. Let us make a new beginning,” Naidu said. 
 
 Naidu had abruptly adjourned   on Friday after   MP   asked him if he was witnessing such logjam for the first time.
 
 An upset Naidu had said, “No, no, that is not the issue. Because somebody had committed some mistake, I also commit... So you want this to continue.” Chaturvedi said the House did not run for one complete month, referring to the logjam during UPA-2.
