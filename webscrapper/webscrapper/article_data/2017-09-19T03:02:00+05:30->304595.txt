Panaji: Due to the incessant rainfall over the last few days, four dams in the state are nearing their full capacity, minister for water resources Vinod Palyekar said on Monday. 

 “Dams, especially in Selaulim,  , Amthane and Panchwadi, are filled and excess water is usually left in the river downstream. The public is cautioned by the water resources department not to venture into the rivers especially downstream of dams due to the sudden rise in the water level of the rivers,,” minister Palyekar announced.
 
 From Anjunem dam, 20 cumecs (unit to measure rate of water flow, as cubic metre per second) was released by opening all four gates. Levels at the Kashti and Valvanti rivers are set to rise due to this water release. WRD releases the water from the dam as a precautionary measure.
 
 The dam’s reservoirs are mainly rain fed and reach full capacity during monsoons. The situation is similar in other dams in Goa as well but they have a natural discharge system for excess water.
 
 Barring Anjunem, other dams are not controlled by gates, but excess rain water received in the catchment area of the dam is automatically discharged through weirs (a kind of enclosure), which are constructed and designed for such events.
 
 The Dam Safety Panel had suggested automation of the water-release gates at Anjunem dam, currently in the planning stage, and has also suggested replacing the apron covering the bottom of a reservoir adjacent to the dam to avoid water seepage beneath the structure.
