AHMEDABAD: Worried over misuse of mobile phones,   (AMC) has decided to ban the use of cellphones in general board meetings and suspend defaulters for a day. 

 “The AMC will soon install   cameras to record proceedings and take action against the guilty person,” said mayor Gautam Shah. The mayor also warned the corporators against using unparliamentary words and levelling personal allegations in the meetings.
 
 The corporators will have the choice of depositing their mobile phones with security officials or switching them off before entering the meeting halls. During the board meetings, many corporators are seen taking selfies and loading them on social networking sites.
 
 The mayor also made it clear that the members will address only the Chair and will strictly follow the time limit given.
 
 The AMC’s board meeting on the civic body’s annual budget had turned unruly recently with both the   and the   trading charges. Congress corporators also damaged mikes and other properties after the ruling BJP suspended a Congress councillor belonging to a minority community. The Congress, on the other hand, blamed the BJP for the unruly scenes.
