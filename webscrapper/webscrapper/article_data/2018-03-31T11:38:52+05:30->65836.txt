 Talking about wedding vows, Alisha said: "Marriage isn't just the union of two people, it is beyond that. And wedding vows are way more than just a promise. It is a lifetime commitment that forms the foundation of your marriage. According to me, an ideal man is the one who respects and values his lady. And my ideal man is my father".
