VISAKHAPATNAM: Days after the   queered the pitch for ESL Narasimhan, the   wing of the Bhartiya Janata Party has also joined the fray by demanding the Centre to appoint anew governor for the state.   has been officiating as governor for both Telugu states since the bifurcation in 2014.

 State   president and Visakhapatnam MP, K Haribabu, wrote a letter dated January 11 (a copy of which is with TOI) to the Union home minister   seeking appointment of a new governor. Haribabu said in his letter that there is a feeling among people that the governor doesn’t give priority to   as he functions from Hyderabad, Telangana’s capital. The MP went on to claim that there is a strong feeling and desire in the minds of people to have a governor exclusively for the newly-formed state of AP to enable smooth functioning of the administration.
 
 Taking potshots at the governor, the BJP chief said in the letter: “The people of AP desired that the government of the newly-formed state should function from the state itself. Accordingly, the chief minister has shifted the secretariat and its staff to a makeshift building in Amaravati. The CM has also shifted his residence and is functioning from Amaravati.”
 
 It may be recalled BJP floor leader in the state Assembly and Visakhapatnam North MLA, P  , set the cat among the pigeons by accusing the governor of being partial. Pointing to Narasimhan’s actions of sending back the NALA bill thrice, Raju alleged that the governor is denigrating the office and said AP needed an exclusive governor.
