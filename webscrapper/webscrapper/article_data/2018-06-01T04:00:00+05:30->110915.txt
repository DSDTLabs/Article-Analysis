Mumbai: Satyen Kothari, co-founder of   that was taken over by   in a Rs 850-crore deal, has launched his new venture   — a mobile application that ensures money does not remain idle in  .

 Cube has tied up with discount brokerage firm Zerodha and asset management companies for investments. It also facilitates payments and fund transfer services. Customers will also get recommendations on a few scrips from advisers. By connecting all service providers at the back-end, users can seamlessly sweep money from their bank accounts to  . 
 
 Customers can also get money into their savings account, within half an hour from liquid funds, for emergency withdrawals. The service will be available to those who make an initial transaction of Rs 50,000.
 
 The Cube Wealth service will be open for new members until June 5. After this period, membership will be selective with existing members having the option to invite a limited number of friends and family.
 
 Kothari, a five-time entrepreneur, had earlier worked at Apple and Frog Design. He has studied design, computer science, and entrepreneurship at Stanford University.
 
 “One of the keys to wealth creation is disciplined investing in few stocks. Cube’s platform provides access to the best wealth advisers in the market — which were until now available only to high net worth (HNI) investors,” said Kothari. These advisers will guide even those making small monthly investments under systematic investment plans (SIPs).
 
 A key feature of the app is that even small investors get international investment options through funds. These are currently limited to the US and China. “With this app accountholders need not maintain any balance in their salary account. The app will take care of all routine payments and ensure that the balances are invested,” said Kothari.
