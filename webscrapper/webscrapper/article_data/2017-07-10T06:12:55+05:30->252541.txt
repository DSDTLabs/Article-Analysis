VIJAYAWADA:   are drawn between the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the opposition   (YSRC) for by-election to the Nandyal assembly constituency in Kurnool district.

 The fight is between two powerful families in the district – Bhumas and Silpas. It is also a battle two strategists – politician Chandrababu Naidu and poll strategist   whose expertise will be put to litmus test in the face of sympathy and defection.
 
 The two families are firm on winning the seat. What matters in the region for the leaders is their supremacy and not the party. The Bhuma and Silpa families firmly believe that individuals matter more than the party. The Silpas were in the TDP until recently and had lost the 2014 election to the Bhuma family.
 
 Bhuma Nagi Reddy, who won the seat in 2014, had defected to the TDP much against the wishes of Silpa Mohan Reddy. When Nagi Reddy died of cardiac arrest,   made claim to the assembly seat even as people were mourning the constituency’s strongman. 
 
 After being rejected by TDP, Mohan Reddy switched over to the Opposition YSRC and secured clearance to contest the seat. He is now confident of the victory on three factors – his own strength, the strength of the party and the backing of yet another strong family, Gangula.
 
 The Silpa family and the YSRC are leaving no stone unturned to retain the seat as it had won it in the 2014 elections. 
 
 The Bhuma family, now represented by tourism minister  , is banking on the sympathy factor and the advantages of being in the ruling party. Though too young to understand the factionalism, she has to use the sympathy factor to win the seat. 
 
 She had already started invoking the tragic death of her mother   and father Nagi Reddy that had left the family in distress. She is now going around and meeting the people explaining how she had lost her parents and how the YSR Congress is targeting her family.
