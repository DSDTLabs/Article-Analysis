HYDERABAD: With police not cracking down on  , motorists are   stickers like ‘Police’, ‘Press’ or ‘Army’ on number plates or windshields of their personal vehicles.

 According to road safety experts, pasting stickers on registration number is a violation of the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act. However, police were allowing the violators to go scot-free. “We conduct special drives regularly and catch at least 100 motorists sporting stickers of ‘Press’, ‘Police’ or ‘Army’ on their vehicles. If they fail to show their ID proofs, we ask them to remove the sticker immediately and, if any other offence is involved, we issue challan on the spot,”   Suman Kumar said.
  
  
 
 Explaining the reason for spurt in such offences, traffic experts said police have failed miserably to curb such violations. “Unlike drunk drive campaigns, curbing speedsters and helmet violations, police have failed to focus on these violations,” Vinod Kumar Kanumala, founder of Indian Federation of Road Safety, said.
 
 Speaking to TOI, several commuters said such stickers give motorists licence to violate traffic rules. “A person can easily misuse such tags. Traffic police too go soft on motorists sporting stickers like ‘Press’, ‘Judge’ or ‘Army’,” G Bhaskar, a commuter, said.
 
 “Traffic police can issue challan for the offence. Currently, they are verbally warning the offenders and issuing challan only for any other violation. However, instead of just removing the stickers, they can issue challan to curb the menace as it is a violation under the MV Act,” Sundeep K of Autobatics Pvt. Ltd, an automobile start-up, said.
