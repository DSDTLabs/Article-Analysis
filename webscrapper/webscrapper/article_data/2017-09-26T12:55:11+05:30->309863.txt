Actor   has finished shooting for the upcoming   movie. 

  
  
 The 30-year-old 'Game of Thrones' star played the new female lead in the untitled 'Star Wars' spin-off and just weeks after co-stars   and Donald Glover wrap up their scenes, Clarke took to social media and said filming the movie was a 'trip and a half'. 
 
 "Well, now that really was an adventure. The perfection that is @realronhoward posted this little nugget and I had to share again. #untitledhansolomovie was a trip and a half but this genius here made it one I'll never forget. #happydays," Clarke wrote on Instagram. 
 
  
  
 Director Ron Howard - who took over helming the production after   Miller and Phil Lord left the movie over creative differences - also took to social media to announce that Clarke's involvement in the film has ended. 
 
 He wrote on Twitter, "@emiliaclarke has wrapped filming on #UntitledHanSoloMovie. She's given us a terrifically strong and exciting character. Fun to work with, too!" 
 
  
  
 The Han Solo spin-off movie will focus on a younger version of the titular character, with Alden Ehrenreich taking over the iconic role from Harrison Ford, who played Han in four movies.
