GURUGRAM: Two BJP MPs recently raised the issue of the Bhondsi school, where a Class II student was found with his throat slit in a washroom on September 8 last year, in Parliament and sought details of the measures taken to improve campus security in all schools.

 Sheohar (Bihar) MP Rama Devi and her Ranchi (Jharkhand) counterpart   on Monday asked about the shortcomings detected on the   campus during the probe conducted in the aftermath of the seven-year-old boy’s murder.
 
 In his reply,  , minister of state for HRD, said a two-member enquiry committee, constituted by CBSE, found “several irregularities and security lapses” in the school. “The panel found that there was no separate toilet for drivers and conductors, who were engaged by the school. They were using the facilities meant for students and other school staff. Moreover, the toilets had no window grille to stop unauthorised entry from outside. No attendant/aaya was deployed at the toilets to help small kids,” the minister said.
