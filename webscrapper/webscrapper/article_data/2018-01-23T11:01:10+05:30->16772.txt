GUWAHATI: In an attempt to counter the RSS's expansion goals in the northeast, Congress on Monday said it is going to organize an all-faith gathering in April to uphold the state's secular fabric. RSS held one of its largest congregations in the northeast, attended by 50,000 volunteers, here on Sunday. 

 "RSS's Luitporia Hindu Samavesh was nothing but an attempt to Assam a Hindutva laboratory and divide people on religious lines. We will hold an equally grand gathering of people from multiple faiths and ethnicities. Hindutva was never part of Assam's cultural milieu. RSS is trying to introduce its Hindutva agenda to help  ," president of the state unit of   said. 
 
 Saying that Hindutva is a direct threat to   (Assamese identity),   said the Sangh Parivar's "aggressive promotion" of Hindutva has followed the BJP-led coalition government coming to power in   in 2016. "We are an inclusive society where people from different faiths have been living in harmony," he added.
