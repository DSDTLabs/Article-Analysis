SHIMLA: The   cabinet has begun the process to review decisions taken by the previous   government in the last six months of its rule. 

 In a letter issued by the general administration department, all departments have been informed about the government move to review cabinet decisions taken by the Congress from the time when the model code of conduct had come into force.
 
 “Decisions by the previous Congress government from April 1, 2017, onwards will be reviewed and all departments have been asked to lit cabinet decisions of the last six months in a file for perusal and further orders,” official sources said.
 
 During election campaigning, the   had promised the voters   by the Congress government taken in last six months of its tenure, including new developmental projects, and the BJP had questioned the sanctity of such decisions alleging that the projects and schemes were being announced without any budgetary provisions for the same.
 
 A controversy had erupted in September last year when the cabinet had decided to allow in-principal sale of tea gardens under the garb of tea tourism by amending the Himachal Pradesh Ceiling on Land Holding Act, 1972. Then leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal had opposed the decision claiming that it would wipe out ailing tea industry of Himachal Pradesh when already area under tea plantation was very less.
 
 Even then Congress minister G S Bali had opposed the move by saying that change of land use should not be allowed and the land of those demanding the same should be vested in the government.
 
 “Just nearing elections, 40-50 inaugurations and foundations stones were laid by the former chief minister and other Congress leaders almost everyday while sitting in their offices,” CM   had said recently. He further alleged that the Congress leaders had befooled the people as the foundation and inauguration plaques were later sent for installation in vehicles, thus, starting a new culture of taking credit for development.
