NEW DELHI: An informal group of ministers has sought a full-scale review of the   order on SC/ ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, in particular the “dilution” in the form of court’s ruling that anticipatory bail for offences under Act cannot be denied.

 
 The GoM, which met on Wednesday, also sought that the Act in its entirety be restored. They also felt that the law officers should be in complete sync with the government’s view while arguing the case and there should be no tempering of the Act as laid down by Parliament.
 
 The meeting was attended by around two dozen government functionaries, including home minister Rajnath Singh, consumer affairs minister  , law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, social justice minister Thawaarchand Gehlot and relevant secretaries.
 
 The ministers also felt the government should go for an ordinance, if the   does not pass a favourable order. Paswan pointed out that while law officers have put the government’s view in their written submission, the issue of “no anticipatory bail” provision was not stressed. Section 18 of the Act specifies that no person booked under the law will be allowed to get anticipatory bail. The SC on March 20 order had observed, “There is no absolute bar against grant of anticipatory bail... if no prima facie case is made out or where on judicial scrutiny the complaint is found to be prima facie mala fide.”
 
 Paswan also pointed out the need to counter BSP chief Maywati’s stand by citing that during her regime a circular was issued to dilute the law. The circular said if anyone was found to have made a false allegation, action should be taken against such offenders.
