NEW DELHI: Taking exception to the   government’s reluctance to release   to Delhi as per the agreed plan, the Supreme Court summoned on Thursday its   to appear before it on April 23 and directed the state to immediately   to the  

 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta passed the order on a plea of Delhi Jal Board which accused Haryana of disobeying the court’s 1996 order directing the state to release 450 cusecs of Yamuna water daily to Delhi for drinking. DJB told the court that Delhi was facing an acute water crisis owing to shortage in supply by Haryana.
 
  
  
 “Haryana is defying the SC’s directions to supply drinking water at Wazirabad reservoir and is taking undue advantage of being an upper riparian state. It has converted the Yamuna in Delhi into a dry river having virtually no water and consequently no water is available for treatment at Wazirabad,” DJB said. It contended that Haryana was supplying only 330 cusecs of water per day as against 450 cusecs agreed upon. It said the situation would “escalate” with the onset of summer as the demand for water would shoot up.
 
 DJB wants daily check on quantity
 
 The board requested the SC for “daily monitoring of water quantity and quality at Wazirabad barrage/reservoir by an independent agency”.
 
 The Delhi government had earlier told the court that it was in talks with Haryana to sort out the problem, but the two sides failed to come up with an amicable solution and the apex court directed Haryana to restore water supply as per the agreed plan.
 
 Yamuna water sharing between Delhi and Haryana has been a contentious issue for decades. In February 2016, there was a tussle between the two governments over damage to the Munak canal which also supplies water to Delhi. The SC had advised the political parties to work together rather than score political points.
