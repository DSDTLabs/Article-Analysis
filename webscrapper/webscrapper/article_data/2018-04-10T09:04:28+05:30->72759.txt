CHENNAI: A couple taking an elderly woman’s dead body on a bike to a burial ground early on Monday morning created a flutter in Virugambakkam. When police questioned them, the man said the dead woman was his mother, and they were taking her to be buried since they didn’t have money to hire a hearse or conduct a cremation. 

 Seeing Kannan, a 55-year-old farmer, and his wife   taking the body seated between them on the bike made some neighbours suspicious. They called the police. When police arrived,   said he requested his relatives for assistance for a decent cremation for his mother, but none helped. Their elder son  , who drove a cab, had deserted the family after getting married.
 
 Kannan said his family depended on their younger son   who worked in a supermarket. The farmer had moved to the city to stay with his son in a rented apartment. Police said residents of the apartment complex did not interact with Kannan’s family. 
 
 Kannan’s mother  , 85, died on Sunday. With no help or money, the couple decided to bury the body at a burial ground 2km away. They had taken the body from   to the ground when the police team arrived. They helped the couple give a decent burial to the woman.
