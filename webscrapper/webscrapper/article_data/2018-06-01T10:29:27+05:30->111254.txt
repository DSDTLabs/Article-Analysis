JAIPUR: Two days after a 42-year-old property dealer committed suicide after failing to repay loan worth over Rs 1 crore, the   police on Thursday arrested one of the money lenders for abetting in the suicide. The police said they have arrested  , who had given a loan of Rs 19 lakh to the deceased Babu Lal. Lal had already paid Rs 40 lakh as interest, but Narayan kept harassing Lal for more money. 

 
 "We have found several cheques of Babu Lal at Narayan's house. The accused worked as money lender, a business which he had taken over from his father," said Suneel Kumar Jhajharia, SHO Mansarovar. On Tuesday morning Babu Lal Lal had gone to meet his friend Hari Narayan at later's house in   in Mansarovar. After a few minutes, Lal reached the roof of the house, touched a high-tension wire dangling outside the house and was electrocuted.
 
 He was a resident of   locality and had entered the property market only a few years ago. Due to the prolonged slump in the real estate market, Lal was taking loan from lenders in quick succession. He had taken loan on interest from six different persons which was nearly 1 crore.
 
 Lal had named at least six persons, who, he said were continuously threatening him. The police said they have been investigating his call detail records (CDR) to track down people responsible for abetment to suicide.
 
 "These money lenders have been operating illegally. They extort money in the name of interest. Also, their interest rate is extra ordinarily high," the official told TOI, adding that illegal money lending is an offence and the police have been advised to keep a check on such lenders. The police said that a case under section 306 (Abetment of suicide) of the   has been filed against Narayan. The Jaipur police said that they are probing the role of other suspects also in the case.
