JALANDHAR: A government school teacher from Sangrur was killed and five students were injured when a   bus carrying them to Science City, Kapurthala, rammed into a stationary truck on the outskirts of   town in   district on Tuesday morning.

 According to eyewitnesses and police, poor visibility due to fog was the main reason for the collision.
 
 Truck driver Sher Singh had parked the truck on the side of the main carriage way on the national highway (NH) to inquire about the exit point from a roadside shop. The truck was carrying rice that was to be unloaded in Goraya, but its driver could not spot the exit point from the main carriageway of the NH to the service lane.
 
 Driver of the bus carrying students from government senior school, Tungan in Sangrur, apparently could not spot the parked truck and bus rammed into the truck from a side. School teacher  , 54, who was sitting at the front seat, died at the spot while five students sustained injuries. As many as 48 students and three teachers were travelling in the bus.
 
 Goraya station house officer (SHO)   said the parked truck could not be spotted due to fog and it was also not supposed to be parked there. He said a case had been registered against the truck driver.
 
 Goraya residents, who came to help the injured, said more prominent and multiple display sign boards were needed to indicate the entry and exit points. “For outsiders, it becomes tough especially when it’s foggy,” said a police official.
