NEW DELHI:   has been India’s top-ranked singles player for nearly four years now. Except for a brief period last year when   overtook her, Ankita has been the India No. 1 miles ahead.

 
 Yet, the soft-spoken 25-year-old did not feature in the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS). The Ahmedabad-born responded by letting her racquet do the talking. She put on a sterling show during the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania Group 1 matches in the Capital, remaining undefeated throughout the week while beating top-100 players like Lin Zhu of China and Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan. Her resurgence began in November last year, when she marched into the $125,000 Mumbai Open quarterfinals.
 
 The   (SAI) has taken a re-look at her absence from TOPS and finally added her to the scheme after she became only the fifth Indian women tennis player to break into top 200.
 
 “I think my consistency since the Mumbai Open in November last year has helped in my inclusion into TOP. I managed to beat two top 100 players during the Fed Cup and then went on to win the Gwalior ITF tournament. I want to thank the sports ministry, All India Tennis Association (AITA) and Sports Authority of Gujarat (SAG) for backing and believing in me,” Raina told TOI from Anning City in China on Saturday.
 
 “The additional Rs 50,000 a month that I’ll get will help me travel with my physio Rutuja Patange and coach   overseas as well. Earlier, I had to handle everything myself - from booking practice courts, managing training schedules and recovery when I was outside the country, which affected my performances,” Ankita, who lives in Pune, said.
 
 The 25-year-old qualified for the $125,000 Zhengzhou Open but lost in the Round of 32 last week. “Before the year started, my aim was to break into top 150 but I think I can reach that mark by mid-season. I’ll try to keep my form and fitness up to move as high as possible in the ranking,” she said.
