KOCHI: A 23-year-old girl was recently detected with uterine cancer and was asked to undergo immediate surgery for removal of the uterus, followed by either chemotherapy or radiation. The treating doctor then advised her to go for ovarian tissue banking, a fertility preservation method, soon after the surgery.

 She visited an IVF specialist in the city, who suggested a modern but untested method in   in which either the ovarian tissue can be transplanted to the skin of the forearm or trans-positioned inside the abdominal wall away from the pelvis and near to the skin.
 
 The girl is not alone. To ensure that young women detected with cancer don’t lose an opportunity to become mother, doctors are now advising preserving the ovarian tissue before they go for chemotherapy or radiation. The new method was discussed in detail at the meeting of the  , a special interest group on fertility preservation, which met in Kochi last week. It is considered experimental and can be performed in centres with expertise.
 
 “Cancer treatment is no reason to deny a young woman her right to become a mother, unless it is a cancer that has affected her ovaries. We have the facility to go for such treatment but the awareness is lacking,” said Dr  , chairperson,   ( ), Kerala chapter.
