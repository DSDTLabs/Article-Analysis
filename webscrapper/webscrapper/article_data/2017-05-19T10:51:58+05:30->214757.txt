A team of young sters has come up with a bilingual music video, Adi Penne, which has Sai Pallavi's sister, Pooja, in the lead. Directed by debutant Madan, who has been doing promotional videos and adfilms for quite sometime, says, “Akilan, a Chennai-based model is the male lead of this video. We wanted a female lead who can bring that cuteness, and charm on-screen, like Sai Pallavi, and that's how we decided to approach Sai Pallavi's sister.“   This music video, Adi Penne, which has a unique concept, will be released in both Tamil and Malayalam. “Many celebrities from Kollywood and Mollywood liked the concept, and have expressed interest in being a part of the launch. Like how Nenjodu Cherthu was for Nivin Pauly , Nazriya and A l p h o n s e Puthiran, this song will be a launchpad for me, Akilan, and Pooja,“ adds Madan.    The music of Adi Penne is composed by NLG Sibi. Madan says, “ As I am a professional drummer, I have some knowledge in music. I am also currently composing music for a short film, En Avalae.“ He also adds that he will be soon making his directorial debut in Tamil Cinema with Pooja. “I am done with the script, and discussions are on. We have approached a few heroes, too, in the industry.“
