NASHIK: The   (HC) while hearing affidavits of various government offices on Thursday said it was the state government’s constitutional duty to conserve River Godavari.

 The high court said all responsibility has been imposed on   (NMC) for making the river pollution-free and conserving it. “Funds were not given for cleanliness and rejuvenation of the river. The chief secretary should submit an affidavit in this regard on April 18,” said the court.
 
 “The high court has asked the state government to mention if they were interested in river conservation. After their reply, the court would take a decision,” said Rajesh Pandit, petitioner of the river pollution case. In its affidavit, the state government said it had already deployed four police sub-inspectors and 30 policemen and they are working continuously for monitoring river pollution. The petitioner contested this claim and said some monitoring was done a few years ago and during the Kumbh mela.
 
 “The court asked the revenue commissioner to appoint officers to conduct surprise visits to the river bank at least seven times before April 18 and submit a report on whether policemen were present and what action did they take?” said a civic official. The high court asked the state government to read its order on Uttarakhand’s   where it mentioned that the river should be treated like humans.
