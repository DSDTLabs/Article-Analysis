JAIPUR: The relatives of victims alleged that police did not take timely cognisance of their complaint and even roughed up victims. They also demanded that investigation should be given to another police station. 

 'The students had secretly took away the hard drive of Rameez's computer and showed it to school and police, but none of them took any action against the teacher," said  , the lawyer of the victim's family.
 
 Majid Khan, a relative of the victim, alleged on Saturday that one when one of the victims went to register the complaint, the police officials slapped him away. 
 
 "The police could have taken timely actions and register the complaint. But we had to go to the senior   officials to file a complaint," Khan said.
 
 However, DCP   refuted these allegations and said that complaint was filed on February 7 when for the first time the complainants came to police station.
 
 "It is not factually correct, the relatives had first met the Jaipur police commissioner and then came to the police station to file the FIR, we had arrested the accused the very next day and collected evidence," said Bhomia.
 
 However, Khan said that when kids went to the police station to hand over the evidence, the police refused to accept the evidence. Several of the protestors on Saturday carried out protest against the police, accused and school staff for shielding Rameez.
