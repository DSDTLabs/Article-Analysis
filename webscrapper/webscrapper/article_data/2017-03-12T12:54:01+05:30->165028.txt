LUCKNOW: The 'Badi Didi' versus `Chhoti Bahu' battle in Lucknow Cantonment ended in favour of the more experienced woman on Saturday .Veteran politician  , daughter of former chief minister Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna, defeated  , daughter-inlaw of former chief minister  , by over 33,000 votes.

 Joshi garnered 95,402 votes while Aparna got the support of 61,606 voters, leaving BSP's Yogesh Dixit trailing with 26,036 votes. Aparna had worked hard to connect with the voters in a constituency that the SP has never won. In fact, in 2012, the party candidate had lagged at the fourth spot there, prompting the party to decide as early as March 2016 that Aparna would fight from Lucknow Cantonment this year.
 
 The 26-year-old's first electoral fight had been uncertain during the time when her family was caught up in an internal power struggle. But brother-in-law Akhilesh plumped for her and the University of Manchester alum was ready for her first campaign. But like her sister-in-law, Mulayam's elder daughter-in-law Dimple, the maiden experience wasn't a triumphant one.
 
 Aparna's rival Joshi told TOI, “I was always certain about my victory but wanted to outdo my previous performance.“ In 2012, she had contested the same seat for the Congress and won with 21,753 more votes than BJP's Suresh Tewari.
