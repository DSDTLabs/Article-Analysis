MUMBAI: Fire officials, who are investigating previous Saturday’s blaze at   in Chembur, will have to rely heavily on eyewitness accounts of whether the stage where the fire broke out had safety equipment in place. The   is expected in a fortnight.

 The blaze gutted a major portion of a television show’s set fire on the premises.
 
 A senior fire official said, “We will have to rely on eyewitness statements about the incident and also whether fire safety equipment was in place. Considering that it was a set, we need to ascertain whether the wiring was correctly done,” said the official and added that they will probe whether there was any   involved.
 
 The blaze has caused significant damage to shooting equipment, clothes, imitation jewellery, decoration equipment, furniture and the AC duct area on the ground floor of the one-storey structure. Firemen said the load-bearing-wall structure was being used as a studio.
 
 “We would also be finding out what led to the loud explosion on the roof. While accidents do take place, negligence is not acceptable if it has led to such a major fire. We would be very stringent in inspecting the site,” added the officer.
