HYDERABAD: The Telangana government may have foisted the   of Hyderabad along lines of the Tokyo model, but the state capital needs to go a long way even to achieve 10% of the Japanese success. Pollution control measures in Hyderabad are no match to those of Tokyo.

 Experts said, Hyderabad is faced with both natural and anthropogenic (human) pollution ranging from high levels of   and rising background natural radiation to indoor radon and  . Also, toxic heavy metals in road dust, pollen allergens in air and estrogen contamination of water sources add to the alarm. Quality of air, water and soil in Hyderabad is fast deteriorating going by research by various institutions, including Osmania University, National Geophysical Research Institute and Jawaharlal Technological University.
 
 While Clean Authority of Tokyo has meticulously worked out a blueprint for scientific disposal of solid municipal, hospital and industrial waste, Hyderabad does not have a proper scheme on municipal garbage disposal or prevention of leachate of harmful contaminants into the soil.
 
 Unlike Tokyo, the state capital is plagued by road dust pollution that contains cancer-causing and radioactive particles. The initial euphoria of the Swachh Bharat campaign has died down, leaving residents in the city gasping for fresh air.
