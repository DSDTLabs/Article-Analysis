 The Sensex dropped by over 137 points or 0.40 per cent to close at 34,046.94 on Friday to extend losses for the third day in a row as fiscal deficit worries and global sell-off triggered by US Fed rate hike fears continued to unsettle investors despite positive macro data.

 "Markets traded dull and ended lower amid mixed local cues. Initially, participants took note of encouraging GDP figure and uptick in core sector data, which helped index to open higher despite weak global markets. However, further widening of fiscal deficit also dampened the sentiment to some extent and capped upside," said Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking Ltd.
 
 Official data showed that fiscal deficit touched Rs 6.77 lakh crore at the end of January, 113.7 per cent of the target for the entire fiscal, on account of higher expenditure.
