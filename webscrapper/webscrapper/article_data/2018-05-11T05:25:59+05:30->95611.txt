NEW DELHI: Members of the Law Commission and   are scheduled to meet on May 16 to explore the possibilities of holding simultaneous elections to   and state assemblies starting with the general elections due in May 2019. 

 A source said the Law Commission had requested the Election Commission to hold a joint deliberation on exploring options and changes required in the law, both amendments in the Constitution and in the Representation of People Act, before finalising its recommendation.
 
 The law panel had held a full commission meeting last month while issuing a working paper on simultaneous elections and had invited comments from all stakeholders, including political parties.
 
 While considering its draft working paper in a full commission meeting on April 17, the commission was of the view that amendment of the Constitution is required besides the Representation of the People (RP) Act and the Rules of the Procedure of Lok Sabha and those of the assemblies for holding simultaneous elections to assemblies and Parliament.
 
 The commission, while issuing a public notice inviting opinions from all stakeholders, had set a deadline of May 8 to receive comments so that the commission would formalise its recommendation.
 
 Any amendment to the Constitution would require two-third of the members of both Houses of Parliament present and voting to approve the legislation followed by its ratification by at least 50% of the state assemblies. The government would require consensus of all major political parties to push through any such legislation.
