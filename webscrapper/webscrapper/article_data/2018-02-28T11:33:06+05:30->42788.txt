NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has directed the state government to provide four times compensation to the project affected persons (PAPs) of Vena dam whose land was acquired for its canal way back in 1996.

 A division bench of justices   and Arun Upadhye also asked it to grant that amount with 8% interest since the land was acquired. The judges further told the petitioners to make a representation to land acquisition and sub-divisional officers in Mouda division for seeking compensation. 
 
 Counsel SP Kshirsagar, appearing for the petitioners, relied on the judgment in a similar matter passed by the HC’s   bench which allowed the enhanced compensation to petitioners by a multiplier of ‘2’. Counsel VG Palshikar, who appeared for the department, stated that facts in cases of both sets of petitioners before the Aurangabad and Nagpur benches were almost identical.
