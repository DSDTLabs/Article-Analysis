NAVI MUMBAI: Debris is being dumped on a 25,000 sq ft of land behind   on the border of sectors 10 A and 11, Vashi, while the authorities are busy transferring responsibility, alleged angry local residents.

 Residents are demanding complete stop to debris and waste dumping at spots along the one-km pathway connecting the two sectors. 
 
 A team of residents from sectors 11 and 12, who are facing the same problem, also visited the site along with   on Saturday morning. 
 
 Hemant Sharma from the NGO said that they have launched a signature campaign against the debris dumped on the stretch near the creek. 
 
 “We will submit the petition for corrective measure soon,” he added.
 
 But the authorities are busy passing the buck. Mahendra Singh Thoke, ward officer, NMMC, claimed that the plot was under forest department. 
 
 “Civic body does not have any jurisdiction over the land. We have built a compound wall on the main road side so that vehicles cannot enter and dump debris,” he added.
 
 But K D Thakre, deputy conservator of forests (Thane), told TOI on Saturday that the area comes under mangrove cell since the cell got created some three years ago. “They should be the ones to look into the matter,” he added.
 
 But one of the area officers of the mangrove cell of the forest department cell said that the plot of land belonged to Cidco. 
 
 Meanwhile Airoli mangrove cell office said that it will promptly look into the issue.
 
 Meanwhile, the local Shiv Sena corporator, Harish Chandra Bhoir, has alleged that the some people from forest department are hand-in-glove with unscrupulous elements.
