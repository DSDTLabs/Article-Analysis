CHENNAI: Startup  , a train travel marketplace, has launched milk delivery service for train travellers. Warm milk will be delivered in specially designed spill-proof  . The milk for babies can be ordered through the RailYatri app and delivered at the designated stations.

 RailYatri.in analysis found that in more than 80% instances, trains are not prepared to serve   or milk to passengers. Long delays and uncertainties that often mark train travel add to this persistent problem leaving travelling parents in a big fix.
 
 “Train travel can have some severe hurdles when you are travelling with an infant. Our effort is to make sure no mother goes through the agony of seeing her hungry baby cry. Keeping such emergencies in mind, we will now deliver warm milk for babies in hygienic, spill-proof packages. We already serve great meals for the entire family, so why should the little ones’ need be unattended,” says Manish Rathi, CEO and co-founder, RailYatri.in.
 
 “Parents usually carry their baby's food and milk along. However, in case of unforeseen situations like long train delays or if someone forgets to carry baby food, you now do not have to worry about milk for your child. We have taken special care to deliver milk in the best condition, with emphasis on hygiene and quality packaging,” explains Rathi.
