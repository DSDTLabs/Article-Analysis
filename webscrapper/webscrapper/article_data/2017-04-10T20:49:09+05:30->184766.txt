Superstar 
  has cancelled a proposed meeting-cum-photo opportunity with his fans, that was scheduled between April 12 and 16. As D-Day drew close, the actor released a voice message to fans stating that the meet and greet would not be possible, as conditions were not feasible. 

 Addressing the media,   said he would have to cancel the meeting as it would be difficult to take pictures with each and every fan. 
 
 According to reports, Rajinikanth said that his initial idea was to meet his fans where they could take pictures and organise a get-together of sorts. 
 However, on realising the mammoth task ahead and the difficulties that could arise, he said that they then went ahead with the idea of taking group photos. However, fans expressed their disappointment in that idea. Understanding that it would be unfair to take group photos instead of personal clicks with the fans, the actor has promised to think of another plan. 
 
 He was quoted as saying, “In future will plan to have a meeting in every district separately so fans can take individual photos. I am sure you understand.”
 
 It has been reported that Rajinikanth has stopped meeting his fans after an unfortunate accident in 1998 resulted in the death of a few.
 
 Meanwhile, on the work front,   is currently shooting for director S Shankar's ‘2.0’ that also stars the new National Award winner   playing the role of the antagonist. 
 
 The film is scheduled for an 18 October 2017 release.
