The last time these two came together on screen (for ' '), everyone thought they were an unlikely pair. But they pleasantly surprised everyone with their fresh chemistry on screen, and their performances were lapped up by the audience. An attempt was made to bring them back together on screen a year ago, but a twist in the tale pushed it on the back burner.
 
 Now, two years since their first outing, Ayushmann and Bhumi will come together again for another quirky love story. Of course, having lost oodles of weight, the leading lady is a far cry from her appearance in her first film. This one, titled Shubh Mangal Savdhan, directed by RS Prasanna, will be jointly produced by   and Eros. The film will be shot in Delhi and   in a start-to-finish schedule and will release in August this year. 
 
 Coincidentally, the lead pair’s first film was also set in Haridwar. Aanand says, “Shubh Mangal Savdhan is a funny and layered story. These are the kind of stories I’ve identified with, right from the time I made ' '. It is a simple narrative with an interesting bend and the reason I cast Ayushmann and Bhumi is that they fit the bill perfectly for this part. They are the sort of actors I could be friends with even if they didn’t belong to the fraternity. They are simple and humble.” 
 
 Given that he loves the script so much, why is he not directing it himself? He explains, “I don’t easily direct a film, but I enjoy backing films with lovable characters woven into interesting stories. I also like supporting filmmakers who can do justice to a certain kind of story.”
