New Delhi: In an effort to minimise   of   and tell people about benefits of water conservation, Delhi Jal Board ( ) kicked off a ‘save water’ campaign on Tuesday. 

 The government body will focus on students, resident welfare associations and NGOs. Under the campaign, presentations will be conducted in 20-25 schools, telling students about habits that will help in saving water, along with activities for them. 
 
 “Children are the mediators of change who need to be educated about the scarcity of potable water, which is only 1% of the total amount of water on our planet,” said a DJB official.
 
 The activities lined up for students will include mental drills and other fun activities, and certificates will be given to encourage them. The campaign is expected to run till May 15.
 
 DJB officials will also address RWA representatives on the issue of water conservation in houses, beginning with water storage equipment like overhead tanks. “Leakages from overhead tanks result in large amounts of water being wasted. This can be stopped by tools like water alarms,” added the official.
