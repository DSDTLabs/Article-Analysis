AHMEDABAD:   (GU) is in controversy yet again as it has been alleged that each tasked with evaluation has been handling over 400   a day. This is against the norms of GU, which say that one   only 60 answersheets each day.

 Sources in the university said that the professors have been evaluating answersheets of BCom semester -2 exams. 
 
 “According to the norms, a professor can evaluate only 40 answersheets a day, and if the   wishes, then only, the number of answersheets can be increased to 60,” said sources in the GU.
 
 “These norms are not followed as each professor is given over 400 answer sheets to evaluate in a day. If a professor cannot finish evaluation work, then he or she also takes remaining answersheets home,” sources in GU said.
 
 According to the norms, professors who come for evaluation should be checked by   to ensure that they are not going away with any answersheets, but this is also not being followed, said sources.
