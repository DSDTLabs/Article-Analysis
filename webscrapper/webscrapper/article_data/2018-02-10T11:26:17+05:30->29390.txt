JAIPUR: The state has secured an appalling last rank among 21 bigger states in the ‘performance in health outcomes’ category when   released the health index of the country on Friday.

 It has done slightly better and come 20th in the overall ranking for 2015-16 in the   Aayog and   survey, ‘Healthy States Progressive India Report’.
 
  
  
 
 The ‘performance in health outcomes’ index covers state’s neo-natal mortality rate, total fertility rate, under-five mortality rate, sex ratio at birth, proportion of low birth weight among newborns, percentage of full immunization coverage, proportion of institutional deliveries, proportion of people living with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy, treatment success rate of new microbiologically confirmed TB cases.
 
 In all these health indicators, collectively, the state’s performance is the worst among 21 bigger states.
 
 However, the overall reference year (2015-16) performance ranking of the state remained unchanged in the second last position. The overall ranking was decided on three broad categories—health outcomes (indicator), governance and processes.
 
 While Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh are the top three ranking states in terms of annual incremental performance, Rajasthan’s incremental performance was just moderate and not enough to improve its ranking. In comparison to base year (2014-15), Rajasthan’s overall performance index score increased by 2 points from 35 to 37. “Despite increases in the composite health index scores, the rankings of Maharashtra,  , Bihar, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh did not change between base and reference years,” says the report.
 
 The state’s incremental rank is 8th in the country. Since all the other states except UP already have much better scores than Rajasthan, the moderate incremental change (2 points) did not help the state in improving its ranking.
 
 Even though the incremental changes for Kerala,  , Himachal Pradesh are negative, they have secured the 1st, 4th and 5th ranks, respectively. Kerala is at the top with 77 points in the overall performance index score.
 
 “The top five performing States for the reference year, based on the composite index score, are Kerala (76.55), Punjab (65.21),   (63.38), Gujarat (61.99), and Himachal Pradesh (61.20). On the other end of the spectrum, Uttar Pradesh (33.69) scored the lowest and ranks at the bottom preceded by Rajasthan (36.79), Bihar (38.46), Odisha (39.43), and Madhya Pradesh (40.09),” says the NITI Aayog report.
 
 However, the report says “for the health outcomes domain (health indicators), Kerala is ranked at the top and Rajasthan at the bottom, while for key inputs/processes, Tamil Nadu earned the top position while Uttar Pradesh received the lowest ranking.”
 
 The health outcome index score of the state has slipped by one point from 30 to 29 (from 2014-15 to 2015-16). The incremental change of health outcome has gone negative in the state. In 2014-15, the state stood at the second last position with 20th rank and UP came last. But, UP has now secured 7 points (incremental change) and moved up to 20th rank while Rajasthan slipped into last position.
 
 But the state has improved drastically in key inputs/processes domain, which is one of the three factors on which the rankings of states have been decided. With an addition of 17 more points, Rajasthan achieved the highest incremental change in this category. In key inputs/process domain, it has secured 10th rank among 21 bigger states.
 
 Box: The Criteria
 
 *Overall performance ranking of states depends on —health outcomes (indicators), key inputs/processes and governance and information
 
 *Under governance and information comes data integrity of institutional deliveries, first trimester ante-natal check-up registration, average occupancy of three key posts (principal secretary health, director of national health mission and health director) and average occupancy of chief medical officer in months
 
 *Under key inputs/processes come vacancy of auxiliary nurse midwives, senior nurses, medical officers, specialists at district hospitals, percentage of functional first reference units, primary health centres, cardiac units, birth registration, first trimester antenatal check-ups, etc.
 
 *Health outcomes (indicators) cover neonatal mortality rates, under-five mortality rate, total fertility rate, percentage of children with low birth weight, sex ratio at birth, etc.
 
 Box: Points to Ponder
 
 *NITI Aayog report says that the number of girls born for every 1,000 boys has deteriorated most, and slipped from 893 to 861 from base year to reference year (2014-15 to 2015-16).
 
 *Full immunization (percentage) and institutional deliveries (percentage) has deteriorated from 79 to 78 and 75 to 74, respectively. Also, TB treatment success rate has also taken a dip
 
 *Also, average occupancy of chief medical officers has deteriorated
 
 *Vacancy of specialists at district hospitals has increased from 41.47% to 45.77%
