AHMEDABAD: As many as 28 Congress MLAs were suspended from the   for a day and 15 of them evicted from the house after they created a ruckus over the suspension of  

 However, Speaker  , who suspended the opposition MLAs in the first half, revoked the suspension in the second half after the Congressâ€™ chief whip, Amit Chavda, tendered an apology on the behalf of his colleagues.
 
 The row began earlier in the day when Thumar said that the BJP government in Gujarat had not built a single dam during its 22-year rule. However, while replying on the budgetary demands for his department, agriculture minister R C Faldu listed out various irrigation schemes launched by the BJP-ruled state government since it came to power in 1995.
 
 As the minister named Thumar in his speech, the Congress MLA stood up and started arguing with him. The Speaker intervened and repeatedly asked Thumar to sit down, but the Congress MLA continued with their verbal attack. At one point, he even dared Trivedi to suspend him when Trivedi warned him of suspension. Later, Trivedi suspended Thumar for the rest of the day, following which several Congress MLAs rushed into the well of the house, alleging injustice and high-handedness by the BJP. As around 15 Congress MLAs sat in the well, Trivedi first suspended them for the rest of the day and then called in the marshals to evict them.
 
 Those standing in the well were also suspended by Trivedi. In all, 28 agitating Congress legislators were suspended for the rest of the day and the remaining 30-odd party MLAs in the house staged a walkout.
 
 In the second half of the session, Chavda tendered the apology after which the suspension was revoked.
