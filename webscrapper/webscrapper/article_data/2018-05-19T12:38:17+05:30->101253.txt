GAYA: Alarmed by the recent   (WHO) report ticking off   as the fourth most polluted city in the world, district magistrate Abhishek Singh has written to the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) to get a detailed study conducted to identify the causes of the high   level in the otherwise non-industrial township.

 The BSPCB has also been requested to recommend measures to effectively control the rising pollution menace. Tourism experts claimed that the WHO report is likely to discourage foreign tourists, particularly Europeans and Americans who are quite health conscious to visit Gaya.
 
 The DM also said that some immediate measures are being taken to curb air- pollution including covering vehicles carrying construction material and sprinkling water at construction sites among others. “Suspended particles from construction sites and vehicles carrying construction material may cause asthma,” Singh said.
 
 “Conceding that those engaged in construction activity in the town do not follow environment-friendly norms,” the DM said and added that the   officials have been directed to implement the rules strictly and tighten the noose of erring builders.
 
 As per norms, construction material including sand, stone chips and cement are required to be kept under cover but most people keep them open on the streets. 
 
 Construction sites too are required to be covered to prevent spread of dust and other hazardous particles that pollute the air.
 
 “As per lease conditions, those engaged in mining or quarrying activities have to undertake adequate plantation and ensure regular water sprinkling. Violators of the lease conditions would be punished,” said the district magistrate.
