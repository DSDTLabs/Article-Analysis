AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday turned down a petition filed by a former faculty member of the   ( ) against her sacking in 2012.

 Deepa   was working with apparel and merchandising department on two-year contract. After complaints from other faculty members, NID management discontinued her services by paying her Rs 40,000 toward the notice pay for one month.
 
 Chalke approached the HC challenging NID’s decision of terminating her contract without any reason. She submitted that he had complained to the authorities about the harassment she was facing from other officials of the institute. She had also complained against the warden of NID’s hostel by terming his behaviour derogatory to her personal and professional well-being. She also complained about the behaviour of security guards.
 
 Chalke had urged the court to direct NID management to take action against the warden and to reinstate her in service. NID opposed by saying that there was no question of giving the job back to her.
 
 NID defended its decision by maintaining that its management continued to receive complaints against Chalke. It also submitted that the discontinuation of her contract was as per the term mentioned in her contract agreement that one-month notice was required for either of the parties to end the contract.
 
 NID submitted to the court that it was very difficult for its management to continue Chalke’s service. There was ample material with the institute which would justify the discontinuance of her service. 
 
 She was sacked because of valid necessity.
 
 After she was sacked, Chalke was asked to vacate the residential accommodation. The single-mother had also raised the issue before the high court, which had then stayed NID from evicting her from the quarter.
