PATRAN ( ): A day after Delhi deputy chief minister Manish   urged the people of   to vote as if   would be the chief minister of the state, the   convener and Delhi chief minister ruled out the possibility.

 Campaigning for his party in Patiala, Kejriwal told TOI on Wednesday, “I am the chief minister of Delhi. The people of Delhi have given me a responsibility. Therefore, I cannot be Punjab CM. I will not leave Delhi.”
 
 Sisodia’s appeal to people to vote for Kejriwal as AAP’s CM face at a rally in Mohali had surprised many. However, Kejriwal defended Sisodia, saying there was nothing wrong in what his deputy had said.
 
 He added, “The CM of Punjab will be a local MLA, not from Pakistan or France, if my party is voted to power.But I will take full responsibility for every promise made by AAP .“He also denied that he may shift to Punjab if his party forms the government.
 
 “It's laughable how both SAD's Sukhbir Badal and Congress' Captain Amarinder were rattled within a split second at the thought of my entry into Punjab,“ he said.“That's because I will bring accountability into their past, whether it's of Badals' firms or the drug trade or Amarinder's Swiss accounts.“
 
 He also said he was delighted to see support drumming up for AAP as a national party and recognition from other regional parties but he said he would not run for the PM's office in 2019.
 
 “I believe all parties should come together on issues pertaining to a crisis. As far as alliance with any of these parties is concerned, I have no ambitions whatsoever for 2019. My target is to fix Punjab's crisis. We're not interested in satta. Alliances are the hopes of parties whose czars want power. I have no interest in this,“ he said.
