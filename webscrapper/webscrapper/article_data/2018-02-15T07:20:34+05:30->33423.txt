KOLKATA: The state CID probe into the Rs 350-crore cash-forgold scam allegedly involving a section of Jhargram police led by retired IPS officer   has come under the central agencies’ lens. ED and I-T officials wonder why the IPS officer was allowed to put in papers when the state police got a whiff of the scam while Ghosh was in service. They have also taken note of the FIRs against Ghosh that clearly mention that the scheme was floated following PM Narendra Modi’s demonetisation announcement.

 ED officials suspect that the scheme was tailored to siphon off unaccounted money of Ghosh and those who she was close to. They are also trying to find out if police vehicles were used to carry the demonetised cash to safe places.   officials have already spotted some people in neighbouring   who had a hand in exchanging old cash for the new ones against a huge premium. They are now trying to identify those who gave the scrapped cash to these people. Central agencies will get in touch with the state CID for inputs to connect the missing links of the reported scam.
 
  
  
 
 
 Even as Ghosh, now in hiding, has rubbished all allegations as “false and fabricated”, CID claims they are on right track. They spent all the day making list of the three accused police officers other than Ghosh — Chitta Pal, Subhankar De and Rajsekhar   — all in custody. CID officers arrested Pyne on Tuesday after he fumbled for a reply to their questions. A CID team had raided Pyne’s house the day before and also spoke to his neighbours.
 
 A Midnapore court remanded Pyne in police custody for nine days on Wednesday. The court earlier rejected Pyne’s bail plea. Jhargram police have sprung into action hours before CM Mamata Banerjee’s public meeting at   on Thursday and her scheduled administrative meeting at the   on February 16.
