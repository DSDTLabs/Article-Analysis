PATNA: State health department on Friday cancelled the ongoing postgraduate   counselling conducted by Bihar Combined Entrance Competitive Examination Board ( ). Now, counselling for all seats will be held on May 28 and 29 and the admission process would be completed by May 31.
 
  “Earlier, the counselling were conducted in phases for reserved and general categories. But now, it will be a combined counselling. We will try to fill up all the seats in the two days. The students in the reserved category would be given the option of choosing between merit and quota only once,” said state health department’s principal secretary  .
  
  Those who have already got admission would have to appear for counselling again. However, they would not have to pay admission fee again if selected for a different college.
  
  Officials said the reserved category students qualifying on merit used to take general seats in an institution and re-appear in counselling for reserved category in another college. Having got admission in an institution of their choice, they vacated the general seats, which were filled up by a candidate under reserved category. That reduced the seats under general category. “The students opposed this arrangement during counselling last Tuesday and four PMCH medicos were arrested for creating a ruckus,” said an official. They were released on bail on Thursday.
  
  “We looked into the objections raised by the students and noticed some discrepancies. Some rules had been misinterpreted,” Mahajan said.
  
  The counselling would be conducted for 449 seats — 350 for PG degree and 99 for PG diploma. This includes 136 PG degree seats and 32 PG diploma seats that the central government was unable to fill under the all-India quota and surrendered to the state government.
  
  Students can camp at the State Institute of Health and   where the banks have been invited to help students in making the draft for admission.
