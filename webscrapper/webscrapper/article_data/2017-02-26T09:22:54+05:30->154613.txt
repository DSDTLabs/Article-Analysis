KOCHI:  , one of the five   in Kerala identified by the State Biodiversity Board has been facing threat to its existence. Since the   has identified an area adjacent to it as ' ' in the  , local residents fear the fauna and flora in the area will be destroyed due to the ensuing pollution.

 The threat to the Kavu was raised at the three-day Kerala Sacred Grove festival, which began in Vyasa Vidyalaya in Kakkanad on Saturday.
 Those who attended the festival extended support to a public agitation which has been going on in Perumbavoor to protect the Kavu, when a native from Perumbavoor raised the issue.
 
 The preferred industrial area is situated just 200m away from the Kavu. When companies are set up in the region, the paddy fields around there will be filled up. This will lead to the drying up of ground water sources and destruction of trees," said Rajesh T, the local resident who raised the issue.
 
 Currently, a plywood company is functioning at the three acres near the area and the remaining region, which was a paddy field, is being filled with rice husk ash in order to drain water from the land.
 
 When an area is declared as industrial area, corporates will get permission to set up companies in the area. It will have a long term impact on the ecosystem of the Kavu, he added.
 
 The plywood company was closed for a few days due to the protest raised by the local residents.
 Iringole Kavu is a thick forest spread over 60 acres and is home to numerous birds, fauna and flora, with some endemic species unique to the region.
