CHANDIGARH: Municipal councillors on Thursday discussed an array of issues during the monthly house meet, including allotment of taxi stands, illegal hawkers on roads and poor functioning of the enforcement department among others.

 Senior deputy mayor   raised questions over the transfer of inspectors of the enforcement department. “The transfers of inspectors are not being done in a proper manner and the way areas are divided among them is not feasible. Moreover, those inspectors who are not behaving properly with the public should be given public dealing postings.”
 
 In a reply to Dhillon’s, joint municipal commissioner Tejdeep Singh Saini said that he transferred the enforcement inspectors as per his wisdom and information and stands by his decision. Saini said he had received complaints against two inspectors and an inquiry is being conducted in this regard. “In the last financial year, the enforcement wing generated a revenue of Rs1.19 crore.
 
 Councillors also discussed the issue of allotment of fixed stands to taxi drivers. The members were of the view that there should not be e-tendering and the current taxi operators should be given the priority while the sites are being allotted. Besides this, the issue of shifting of the car bazaar was also taken up during the meeting. It was stated that a feasible site should be selected for the resale market in the city.
 
 “The coconut vendors are sitting along the roads illegally. Moreover, most of the watermelon sellers have also not been given permission, but they do their businesses along the roads anyway. This can lead to road accidents,” a councillor said.
