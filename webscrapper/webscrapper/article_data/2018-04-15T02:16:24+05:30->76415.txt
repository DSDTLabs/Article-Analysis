NEW DELHI: There should be a   for politicians while   with   in the way there is a code for   when it comes to dealing with  , many former and serving bureaucrats said in a   held on Saturday on the issue of relationship between the   and civil servants.

 Talking at the discussion — Relationship between Elected Representatives (including Political Executive) and Indian Civil Services: Evolving a Code of Conduct — district magistrate and honorary president of Delhi Administration Officers’ Academic Forum (DAOAF), K Mahesh, said that while there is a laid down code of conduct for civil servants when it comes to dealing with elected representatives and the political executive, there is no such code for elected representatives. “We need to have such a code and this will go a long way in ensuring mutual respect and will bring transparency and probity in governance,” he said.
 
 The panel discussion assumed more importance as it comes in the wake of the ongoing standoff between civil servants and the political establishment in Delhi. After the alleged assault on Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash at CM Arvind Kejriwal’s residence in February, officials have stopped taking part in meetings with ministers and communicate with them only in written form.
 
 Former Delhi CS Omesh Saigal said that instead of the present system of governance, Delhi could have a mayor-in-council system. Anshu Prakash was present at the panel discussion, even though deputy CM Manish Sisodia didn’t come despite an invite, the organisers said.
 
 “In the relationship between the political executive and civil servants, the political executive has the obligation of translating the wishes of the people into legislation and the civil servants implement the policy decided by the political executive,” said Prabhat Kumar, former cabinet secretary and governor of Jharkhand.
