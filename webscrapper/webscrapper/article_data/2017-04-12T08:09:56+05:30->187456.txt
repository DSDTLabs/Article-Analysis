JAIPUR:   has banned hiring in government services through  , while also restraining the state government from employing a person on contract for a 'post of permanent nature'.

 Now, if the government has to hire a person on contract basis even for posts created under various schemes by the state or central government it will have to be merit based. The court ruled that the selection of any candidate, even on contract, will have to be through a proper channel, like inviting of applications through advertisements and conducting a written exam.
 
 The ruling by the single judge bench of Justice Sanjeev Prakash Sharma was on a petition filed by Surendra Kumar Gurjar and others who had challenged the state government's directive to cancel contract of a placement agency at 10 primary health centres. The petitioners had contested that at other health centres the hiring work was being done through placement agencies.
 
 The court observed that the government could lay down a procedure or constitute a nodal agency for conducting exams for hiring employ ees on contract.
 
 The court also said that no interviews should be done for such recruitment, observing that the same could lead to randomness in selecting candidates. The merit list of the candidates should be published showing the marks obtained by each candidate, the court observed. Jaipur: However, bonus marks can be given to candidates who have work experience with a government department, the court said.
 
 “Every attempt should be made to see that the entire selection process is transparent and without any unambiguous,“ the court said.
 
 “Considering that such exercise would take some time to be implemented, the court grants three-month time to the government to make such provisions from the date of submission of the certified copy of this order,“ the court said. For those already hired through a placement agency in a government service will henceforth be treated as working on contract.
