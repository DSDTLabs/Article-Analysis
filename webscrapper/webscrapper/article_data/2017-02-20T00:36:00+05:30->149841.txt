Imphal: Joining the BJP attack on Congress chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, his Arunachal Pradesh counterpart Pema Khandu on Sunday said the responsibility to lift the ongoing blockade lies solely with the state government.

 “It is his (Ibobi Singh’s) duty to lift the blockade. I would have lifted the blockade if a similar stir was launched in my state,” said Khandu, speaking at the release of BJP’s vision document. Khandu now heads a BJP government in Arunachal after all Congress MLAs, including him, defected to the saffron party en bloc.
 
 Echoing Khandu, Assam’s finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Ibobi Singh has ignored the grievous public suffering caused by the blockade. “If the state government hands over its responsibility to us, we could end the blockade within 48 hours without the Centre’s help,” said Sarma, the party’s ‘demolition man’ in Assam, who was also instrumental in bringing down the 15-year Congress regime in the neighbouring state.
 
 The blockade called by United Naga Council (UNC) in protest against the Ibobi government’s decision to create new districts entered 121 days on Sunday. It has affected the supplies of fuel and essential items to the state and hurt the state’s economy.
 
 Also in the BJP arsenal were attacks about the manifesto and corruption.
 
 “BJP cares about vision documents. In my state, Congress only studied the previous election’s manifesto and put forth similar points,” said Sarma, who was a Congress member earlier.
 
 Sarma also accused the Ibobi government of corruption in the process of police constable recruitment. He claimed all policemen in Imphal he had spoken to had said they paid Rs 2-3 lakh to get their jobs.
