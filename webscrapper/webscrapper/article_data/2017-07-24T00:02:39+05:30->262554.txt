NAVI MUMBAI: Citizens and activists have been for long demanding   near   and have submitted an application to the PCMC.

 Some locals have converted a natural hollow in the tree’s trunk into a place of worship and even marbled the surface inside the hollow. 
 
 Panvel-based botanist Madan Badgujar, one of the activists trying to save the tree said, “This species is known for its naturally-built hollow spaces in the trunk but the locals have marbled that inner space and spread myths about the tree to attract people.” 
 
 This   tree, which originally belongs to the African continent, is nearly 75 years old and is a heritage property about which the Panvelkars are proud of. The tree is nearly 30 feet tall with a trunk measuring 45 feet in circumference. 
 
 “We should save this tree by deconcretising the base and the root or else it may have a slow death,” said Raju Mumbaikar, the president of NGO Care of Nature. The activists were also willing to meet the mayor.
