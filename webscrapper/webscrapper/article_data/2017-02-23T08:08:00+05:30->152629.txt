GURUGRAM: Officials of Haryana State Pollution Control Board ( ) have submitted a report on Tuesday to the Environment Pollution Control Authority ( ), on work done in Gurgaon to control air pollution.

 The board has highlighted vacuum cleaning of roads and control over dumping of construction waste as their major achievements. “We’ve been successful in bringing down air pollution levels since Diwali last year. It is due to various steps taken by the authorities, some of which include vacuum cleaning of roads and controlling of construction waste dumping. We have also been inspecting construction sites and ensured that all norms are being followed,” said a senior official of HSPCB.
 
 However, sources in EPCA said the city still needs to work on keeping a check over  ,   emitted by   and flagrant burning of waste and garbage in the open. “Though vacuum cleaning of roads done by   is highly appreciated, many other necessary steps haven’t been taken. Control of dust pollution, preventing traffic congestion and burning of waste in the open are major concerns in Gurgaon,” said sources in EPCA. 
 
 To improve  , EPCA had asked Delhi and neighbouring states of Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to submit an action taken report on their graded response system.
 
 EPCA’s graded response system is the first of its kind in the country, which envisages roll out of emergency measures, once air pollution levels go up beyond a threshold. Some of the emergency measures recommended in the graded response system are banning open waste burning and use of coal and firewood, closure of brick kilns, closure of schools, power plants and advisories and asking people to avoid polluted areas. 
 
 There are more than 1,200 construction sites in and around the city. Nearly 15,000 diesel autos ply on Gurgaon’s roads, while all residential societies and commercial buildings are dependent on diesel generators for power back-up. All this add up to the air pollution level in the city.
