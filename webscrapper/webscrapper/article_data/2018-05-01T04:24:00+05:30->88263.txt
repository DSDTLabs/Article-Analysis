Vadodara: Sitting in any corner of the world, the alumni of MS University (MSU) will now be able to remain in touch with their alma mater. On the 70th foundation day of MSU, the university officials unveiled a special online portal from where the alumni can connect to the university and their friends even after many years of their graduating from MSU. The website has a section of newsroom, event and newsletter from where the alumni can get regular updates about the university. Besides that, the alumni can also get in touch with their teachers and batchmates for interaction. According to university officials, the alumni can even create groups of their batchmates across departments and faculties on the portal for interaction. However, that will not act like a social media platform, university officials said. The portal also provides an option to the former students to make donations to the university online. The department can also get in touch with the alumni through the website for inviting them to interact with current batch of students and mentor them. “It will also be like an HR platform because of alumni of different batches will be able to connect with each other. Through that, a senior passed out student can also get in touch with a junior student for the purpose of recruitment,” a university official said. The former students have to register on the website by paying a life membership fee of Rs 1,000. From this fee, an amount of Rs 600 will go to the former students’ department, Rs 200 each to the faculty and university to organize alumni events.
