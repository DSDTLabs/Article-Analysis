Chennai: Work on the underground stretch to connect north Chennai through metro trains in the phase-1 extension of the project will be completed in seven months from February. CMRL officials said they would be excavating a 2km stretch starting from   to   and build tunnels from next month. The 9km phase-1 extension project, built at an estimated cost of 3,770 crore, is planned for completion by 2019. 

 Officials said work to build the station box is under way and the shaft for assembling the tunnel boring machine underground has also begun. The station box will be an extension of the existing underground Washermenpet metro station, built as part of phase-1 of the project. Work to build tunnels in the project was launched by former chief minister   in July 2016.
 
 "We have decided to start tunnel boring in the first week of February and are looking at finishing it by August," an official said. The line will be underground from Washermenpet to Korukkupet and after that it will run on an elevated line up to Wimco Nagar. Work on the elevated stretch will begin once a substantial part of the underground stretch is complete. Once complete, the extension project will give the much needed access to far flung areas of north Chennai through metro trains. According to officials, though the soil conditions are favourable for faster building of tunnels, they will still slow down from the usual pace of excavating the soil, as they do not want to cause any damage to the buildings above.
 
 A report released based on a geotechnical investigation conducted in the 9km stretch in 2016 showed soil conditions from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar comprise mostly three soil types - silty sand, clay or fine sand. However, the tunnels will run below densely populated areas with buildings, including houses and shops, in the arterial stretch of  , which are mostly single brick walled. Hence, engineers want to show more caution when they begin the tunnelling work.
