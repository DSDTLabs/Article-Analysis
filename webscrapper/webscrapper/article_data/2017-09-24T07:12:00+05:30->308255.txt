GURUGRAM: The state government is likely to increase the floor area ratio (FAR) to 500 from exiting 250 for the  , providing a much-needed impetus to the industry.

 According to officials, real estate costs in Gurgaon are very high, which often acts as a deterrent for the sector. Hence, the government is working on increasing the floor area ratio (FAR) as part of the new   and ITES policy launched recently.
 
 “It is the only sector where buildings can be expanded vertically, which is why we have decided to increase the FAR, providing some buffer against the increasing real estate prices,” said  , additional chief secretary (industries), Haryana. The government had increased the FAR last year too, from 175 to 250. But, the increasing real estate prices offset the advantage.
 
 However, experts said the challenge would be to develop infrastructure keeping pace with the increase in FAR. “With the proposed increase in FAR, we will have huge towers coming up across the city. The situation is likely to get worse in Udyog Vihar, which is already suffering due to illegal parking and regular traffic jams,” said  , president,   Industrial Association.
 
 When asked, Singh said the government is already working on the matter to ensure that infrastructure is developed at the same pace. 
 
 “When FAR is increased, we will increase external development charges (EDCs) to augment infrastructure. We will also ask companies to give us space to expand roads, wherever required,” he added.
 
 The new rate of EDC will be decided in consultation with the department of town and country planning.
