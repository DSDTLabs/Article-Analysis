AGRA: The students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) may have to pay Rs 100-200 more every month as hostel mess fee for meat (buffalo) to be back in the varsity's 19 dining halls. Each student currently pays Rs 1,000-1,200 a month as mess fee. 

 A meeting was organised on Thursday between a five-member committee of provosts and the dean of the students' welfare (DSW). With meat going off the daily menu since March 26, AMU students had written to the vice-chancellor on Tuesday seeking intervention in the matter. AMU media consultant Jasim   said the five-member committee of provosts will contact license holders on Friday to ensure resumption of meat supply in the dining halls. The state has been hit by an acute meat shortage following the UP government's crackdown on 'illegal' abattoirs and curbs on mechanised slaughterhouses. While the varsity had purchased meat (buffalo) at Rs 120-130 per kg earlier, Mohammad informed that there has been a steep rise in prices due to low supply.
 
 In the varsity's 19 halls, each catering to five-seven hostels, 25-30 kg of buffalo meat is consumed daily, except on Fridays. That takes AMU's total consumption to 570 kg meat a day. On Fridays, students get chicken to eat and the varsity administration procures 600 kg poultry meat to serve them.
 
 AMUSU president  , in the meanwhile, also said that an increase in hostel fee is likely to affect students coming from financially weaker backgrounds. Many students in the varsity come from middle and lower middle class families, he added. 
 
 The five-member committee, comprising of Prof  , provost of V M Hall, Dr  , provost of I G Hall, Prof Meraj Ahmad, provost of Aftab Hall, Prof Salman Habib, provost of Suleiman Hall and Major S M Mustafa, principal of Sayyid Hamid Senior Secondary School (Boys), which met the Dean of Students Welfare, Professor  , also decided to seek the administration's intervention to fix prices of meat with suppliers.
