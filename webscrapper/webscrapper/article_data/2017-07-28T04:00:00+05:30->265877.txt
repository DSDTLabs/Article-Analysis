Rajkot: A man has registered a complaint of marriage fraud, alleging that he has been duped of Rs 1 lakh by his wife and in-laws as his wife deserted him just after one week of marriage. 

 According to the officials of Gandhigram police station, where the case has been registered, Munna Bharwad has alleged in his complaint that Machha Gamara, Vibha Gamara and Lala Bharwad, who used to work as matchmakers in his community, had shown him the photograph of a woman named Bhavu for marriage.
 
 “Bhavu was divorcee and had a seven-month-old daughter from her previous marriage. Bhavu’s mother Raji told Munna that he would have to pay Rs 3 lakh for marriage, which after negotiation was brought down to Rs 1 lakh. After Munna paid the sum, he was married off to Bhavu. Munna also has the photographs of his marriage. Then exactly after a week of the marriage, Bhavu’s mother Raji came and said that Bhavu would have to accompany her to her native in Aji dam area as there were some legal formalities left to be fulfilled pertaining to her divorce,” an official from Gandhigram police station said. 
 
 Munna waited for his wife’s return for one-and-a-half month, but to no avail. During this period, he went to her relatives in Jetpur and Virpar, hoping to get the news of his wife in vain. Later, he realized that he had been conned and decided to approach the police with a complaint. Police have booked Machcha, Vibha, Lala, Jaya and Raji under Sections 406,420, 120-B and 114 of Indian Penal Code and started the investigation.
