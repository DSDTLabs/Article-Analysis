THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Several MLAs in the assembly on Wednesday questioned the role of   Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organisation ( ) in shaping up master plans for school infrastructure development projects under the general education protection mission plan. 

 MLA KB   sought an explanation from education minister  . He pointed out to finance minister TM   that there were widespread complaints that the government agency was preparing master plans, unilaterally, for schools in their constituency.
 
 "Why should there be an intermediary like Kitco. They have no expertise in these matters. They don't care to hold discussions with MLAs or school authorities before finalizing the master plan. Their design is unscientific and will fail to serve the purpose. Unless the government intervenes, the mission will bring infamy to MLAs and government," he said. Several MLAs from the opposition and ruling benches shared his views.
 
 However, education minister C Raveendranath said Kitco was appointed to ensure that master plans being developed by schools follow the provisions of Kerala Education Rules and the conditions set by KIIFB. "It is not mandatory that Kitco should be engaged in developing the master plan. They are only asked to wet the master plans," he said.
