KOLKATA:  ,   and   of   are heaving a sigh of relief as the institution has come forward to   while they are away at work. 

 IIT-Kharagpur has started a creche-cum-playhouse on its campus and 53 happy babies have already enrolled there.
 
 The creche-montessori playhouse-cum care-giving centre will handle babies to 10 year olds. Children going to primary schools can come directly to the care-centre for food, rest and homework, till their mothers are free to collect them.
 
 A reputable pre-school is running the creche. It has 14 support staff, including six teachers, six ayahs, one attendant and one supervisor. The creche opens at 7.30am and remains open till late in the evening. 
 
 A bungalow inside the campus that was not in use for long has been remodelled to house the new creche. 
 
 It is fully air-conditioned and packed with specialized Montessori teaching equipment, furniture, play area, activity zone and a computer lab. 
 
 Chandrani Singh, professor of geology and geophysics department, has finally stopped worrying about her 4-year-old daughter Archisha. "Now, I can work peacefully knowing that my baby is in safe hands. We often stay back till late because of meetings and research work. Though I had a nanny but there would be days when she would not turn up. That disrupted my schedule," she said.
 
 Sanghamitra Basu, the faculty-in-charge of the creche is happy too. "It was a long-standing demand and finally we have the facility up and running. We have ensured the recommended teacher-student and teacher-caregiver ratio and kept the fee nominal so that everyone can afford it," she said.
 
  IIT-Kharagpur director Partha Pratim Chakraborty said: "The creche was a crying need. We wanted our talented women on campus to put in their best but it was often difficult for them to work at their optimum leaving their babies at home."
