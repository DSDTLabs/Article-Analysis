 became a mommy two months back and she's attending to both baby   and her professional commitments, remarkably well. 

  
  
 The gorgeous actress was the showstopper at the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai and she had something really sweet to say about her hubby   at the event. 
 
    thinks Saif is a really supportive husband as she said that, 'I'm lucky I have a loving and supportive husband because right now he's looking after him (Taimur), so we share the responsibility.' Talking about their relationship, she added that, 'It's like he's my Ka and I'm his Ki and he's very supportive so when he's working, I'm at home and when I'm working he's at home and that's the way I think every man and woman should be and every husband should be to his woman.' 
 
  It is definitely endearing to see that the two are going strong in their relationship and that baby Taimur has brought them closer.
