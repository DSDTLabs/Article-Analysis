NEW DELHI:   (SP) chief   on Sunday cast his vote in the third phase of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections 2017.

 Wearing a red cap, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister cast his vote at a polling booth in Saifai's Jaswant Nagar constituency of the state. Interestingly, Akhilesh's uncle Shivpal Yadav is contesting from the constituency as SP candidate.
 
 "I have voted for SP candidate. I want more and more number of party candidates to win," Akhilesh said while evading a question on uncle Shivpal.
 
 Akhilesh got angry when the mediapersons asked about his father   Singh Yadav not accompanying him for vote, like he always does.
 
 "Netaji (Mulayam) probably wanted to cover other areas. More rallies during election is good for party. Isn't it?" Akhilesh while responding to a question, why Mulayam Singh, whom he ousted as the National President of the party in January, did not turn up for joint rallies with him.
 
 A total of 2.41 crore voters will decide the fate of 826 candidates in third phase polling comprising 12 districts.
 
 There are 16,671 polling centres and 25,603 polling stations in this phase.
