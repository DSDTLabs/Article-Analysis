NEW DELHI: He started stealing pencils as a child, but his hobby of theft soon graduated into  . A 23-year-old youth, the son of an east Delhi trader, had taken to crime to get an adrenaline rush while being chased after committing a theft. The accused, Dilshad, had even roped in a juvenile to assist him. Police may hire a counsellor to find out whether he is suffering from kleptomania as he is not addicted to alcohol or drugs.

 “Dilshad was arrested from a petrol pump in Yamuna Vihar with a stolen scooter. He led the police to his house where he had kept the other stolen properties, including scooters and mobile phones,” said DCP (northeast) Ajit K Singla. 
 
 His father, Shamshad, owns a scrap trading business in northeast Delhi. He is the only son and has a considerable amount of money.
