INDORE: The regional   has slapped a   to the   for violating   (Management and Handling) rules and failing to renew the authorization for   since 2014 despite repeated alerts. 

 The board sent a notice to the district hospital in January after the audit team found a series of irregularities in its day to day operations and violation of mandatory pollution norms. 
 
 “We have served a show-cause notice to the district hospital for violation of mandatory terms and conditions,” said the board’s biomedical cell in charge S N Katare.
 
 According to the pollution board, the hospital has not renewed the authorization since June 30, 2014. The audit team of the pollution found that the hospital do not segregate waste as per the norm and neither follows the colour code as mandated under the rule. 
 
 “There was no record of day to day waste generation in the hospital. They are also not treating the waste water generated from the hospital,” Katare added.
 
 The district hospital is 100 bedded and approximately 80 kg of bio medical waste including recyclable and incinerated waste is expected to be generated from the hospital every day. In absence of lack of proper segregation and disposal of waste, the hazardous bio medical waste is expected to be mixed with municipal waste. 
 
 Katare said, “We are keeping a watch on the hospital and a copy of the notice has been sent to Bhopal to bring to the notice of senior bureaucrats.”
 
 The hospital has also not submitted the annual report of 2015 to the regional pollution board. 
 
 Dr Satish Neema, RMO, district hospital said, “We were trying to renew the authorization but could not do it online due to some technical problem. We are meeting the pollution board officials on Monday and the process of all the necessary permissions will be initiated.”
