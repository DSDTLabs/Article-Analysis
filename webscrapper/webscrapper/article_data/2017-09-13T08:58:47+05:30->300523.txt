LUCKNOW: As Prime Minister   gears up for his first visit to his constituency following the landslide victory by his party in the   elections earlier this year, projects worth Rs 1,800 crore--being billed as  's showpieces ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls--await either completion or inauguration in Varanasi. Modi will be on a two-day visit to Varanasi from September 22.

 The list from Delhi is long and exhaustive, with big-ticket religious tourism projects in the holy city. At least eight of the 16 projects that are approaching completion are religious shrines on mythological structures or popular ancient sages. Six different ministries including textiles, power, road, shipping, tourism and railways are involved in these projects.
