MUMBAI: A cash-strapped   will purchase 24   for Rs 4.65 crore for cabinet members and distinguished visitors on official visit to districts. Each car will cost around Rs 20 lakh and an order has been placed with a Latur dealer.

 The   will be at the disposal of district collectors. Five will be at the disposal of the collector, Nagpur, home town of the chief minister and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, while four each will be at the disposal of the Yavatmal and Aurangabad collectors, three each for Chandrapur and Jalgaon, two for Beed and one each for Solapur, Latur and Gondia. “We have scrapped the 225 Ambassador cars at the disposal of the collectors. It has been proposed to replace these cars with seven-seater vehicles, each costing Rs 20 lakh,’’ a senior   said.
 
 Expressing shock and surprise over the huge expenditure, the bureaucrat said at a juncture when the debt burden will cross the Rs 4.13 lakh crore mark, instead of embarking on a massive austerity drive, the government is purchasing swanky vehicles. “Certainly, it’s avoidable expenditure, instead of purchasing high value vehicles, the CM should have gone in for cheaper vehicles,’’ he said.
 
 The bureaucrat admitted that there is absolutely no control over gross misuse of cars by cabinet members and bureaucrats. “Besides official vehicles, every cabinet member has at least two to three cars for family members. While cabinet members flout rules, bureaucrats are not lagging behind. Besides official vehicles, most bureaucrats have two to three vehicles for family members. Wives of bureaucrats, who are either in government or private service, prefer to travel in red beacon vehicles. The chief secretary must stop this misuse of power,’’ he said.
