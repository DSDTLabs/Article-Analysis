HYDERABAD: Having suffered 15-20% losses in operations already due to 'breakdown of logistics', the 2 lakh industrial units in and around city are seeing red due to the ongoing transport strike.
With the strike entering the seventh day and supplies dyring up, small and medium industrial units are feeling the pinch as these have limited production capacity.
 
 There are around 50,000 MSMEs (Micro, Small and  ) in the core city and another 200 big industrial units. Some of them having already halted production. “We stopped production two days back due to unavailability of raw materials and trucks. Our previous order is lying at the store. There is no point producing more till we can send the earlier batch,“ said Vishwanath Rao, owner of a small food-processing unit at Jeedimetla.
 
 Industry leaders say the remaining units too will be forced to pull down shutters within the next three to four days. “Logistics is very important for the industrial sector, without which the industry is paralysed. Most industrial units are facing shortage in raw materials. With the logistical support being cut off, cost of operations has increased by 15% across industries as units still have to pay for maintenance, labour, godowns and power even as they will not recover the money put in,“ said Ravindra Modi, president, Federation of Telangana &   Chambers of Commerce and Industry .
 
 The impact has been 'strongly felt' across industries but the worst hit are the ones that have perishable goods as raw materials like food processing and packaging. Many plastic manufacturing units have already stopped production, reveale Plastic manufacturers association president Venu Gopal Jasti. Most of them are also having to keep labour idle for several hours.
