GUWAHATI: Unfazed by Beijing’s apparent unhappiness over his upcoming visit to  , the Dalai   said the reaction was “normal”.

 “No problem. It’s normal,” the Tibetan spiritual leader said when asked about China’s objection to his visit to the northeast state. The spiritual leader will leave for   on April 4. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman on Friday warned that the Dalai Lama’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh will “have serious damage on bilateral relations”.
 
 It was second such warning on the spiritual leader’s Arunachal visit from China in the last one month. Speaking at the function, the Dalai Lama exhorted peace through compassion. He said it was not right to associate an act of terrorism with any particular religion. He said some “mischievous” persons may indulge in an act of terror but that does not mean they represent the entire religious community.
 
 “I am very uncomfortable when someone says a Muslim terrorist or a Buddhist terrorist. A genuine Muslim never follows the path of violence. There may be mischievous persons among Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and Jews. These people cannot represent the entire community. It is wrong to generalise,” he said. The Dalai Lama said the only way to end violence was through karuna, intelligence, adherence to moral and ethical values and holding spiritual dialogues.
