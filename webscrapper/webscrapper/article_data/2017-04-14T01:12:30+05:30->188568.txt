THANE: As many as 22 train services on the   sector between Thane and Navi Mumbai were cancelled due to the midweek   undertaken by the   on Thursday. 

 Day one of the 90-minute-long   block on the Thane-Vashi/Nerul railway route led to immense hardships for thousands of commuters who had a tough time reaching their destinations using road transport. The railways have now rescheduled the second block to Saturday instead of Friday.
 
 The block was scheduled to inspect the rails and detect any possible damage due to the increasing heat apart from the regular maintenance like overhead equipment, said officials.
 
 Though railways allowed commuters to travel via   route and Kurla, not many preferred to take the circuitous journey in the sweltering heat. Regulars lamented that it took over 90 minutes to travel the two km stretch between Airoli and Thane. Manoj Badgeri
