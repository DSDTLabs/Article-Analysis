JAIPUR: Rajasthan High court ruled that the regularization and confirmation of 21 employees appointed on an ad hoc basis in the high court is illegal. The court ruled that these employees would continue to work on ad hoc basis and the most high court would do was age relaxation in future appointment in high courts.

 The division bench of Justice MN Bhandari and DC Somnai issued the order on a petition by   who challenged the ‘back door entry’ of relatives and acquaintance of high court judges and employees grabbing job in the high court on a regular basis.
 
 The court said the orders of regularization and confirmation of their jobs issued in 2009 and 2013 respectively issued by the high court administration without following the due process of recruitment is illegal and set aside.
 
 No advertisements were issued for the posts and no tests were conducted to ascertain their merit. The modus operandi was to first appoint them as ad hoc employees and later regularize their job as LDCs. These employees also got promotion to UDCs after their confirmation in their posts.
 
 The Court ruled that these appointments were against the high court recruitment rules of 2002. The high court administration argued that the chief justice has the power to appoint so the court should not intervene. The court said the power of chief justice is confined to ad hoc appointment but for regular employment these posts had to be duly advertised and rules had to be followed.
