INDORE: Indore Municipal Corporation has fined   Rs 1,000 for throwing waste on the streets outside the airport. This is perhaps the first time a civic body has fined an airline for littering.

 IMC officials told TOI on Thursday that they found garbage “thrown by the airline staff” at three locations outside the airport. The corporation immediately summoned the city manager of IndiGo. The airline denied that the garbage belonged to it and insisted that they always disposed garbage “through the proper channel”, an IMC official said. However, the civic body’s investigation revealed that the garbage belonged to IndiGo, he added.
 
 “It is shameful that such a well known airline threw garbage on the streets. While we are running so many initiatives to help clean up the city, such an act was not expected from the company,” said IMC commissioner Manish Singh.
 
 Indore airport generates more than 400kg of waste every day. The airport has an inhouse garbage disposal system that is managed by a private firm. “We have found that the system was not working properly. We will not tolerate such acts by airlines or airport officials,” Singh said, adding that IMC has proposed new plans for disposal of waste to  . “We have suggested ways to ensure that disposal of waste take place in a proper manner. We will charge them according to the service we provide,” the IMC commissioner said.
 
 While the civic body has been fining citizens, business establishments and industries for not disposing of waste properly, this is the first time that it has fined an airline.
 
 IndiGo said it will pay up. “We have led several cleanliness campaigns across the country, and our employees actively participate in them. While we are aggrieved that IndiGo is being fined for the acts of a third party, we understand the spirit behind it and shall comply with the order,” said a statement issued by the airline.
