Actor   was in Lucknow sometime back to promote his show ' '. A regular visitor to the city, Praneet couldn’t get much time to be with his in-laws. "Since I am shooting back to back for two shows, I will not get much time to stay with my in-laws. I will be visiting them but for a short while. However, I love this city a lot, especially now that it is my sasural. And I’ve seen the city change for the good in the past few years. Now the Lucknow Metro has really added to the city. While on my way from the airport to the hotel, I saw the Metro. From outside, it looks fabulous." he said.
After playing negative characters in the serial 'Mahabharat' and 'Rishton Ka Chakravyuh', Praneet once again plays a grey character in 'Porus'. Ask him if he is happy being the bad guy on the small screen and he says, "I always wanted to do good roles whether positive or negative. I never thought that I will be typecast in the role of a villain though I always wanted to play the bad guy. It is all because of   (Kumar Tewary) sir who first saw a villain in me in   and considered me for the role of Shakuni Mama. After I did 'Mahabharat', the whole TV industry sees me as a villain on screen. However, now I am happy playing a villain’s role as I have realised that a bad guy on screen has more shades to him than the other characters," he says.
