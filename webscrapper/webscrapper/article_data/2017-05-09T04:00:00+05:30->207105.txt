Rajkot: A Dubai-based non-resident Gujarati was threatened by three persons, who demanded Rs 3 crore, to let him live. The accused, booked by the police, had said that they would kill him if he failed to make the payment.

 According to Veraval police, Farooq Hasam Makalai, a native of Veraval town, now settled in Dubai, lodged a complaint under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 341 (wrongful restrain of any person), 387 (extortion) and threat to kill against Imran Mugal alias Imran Chipo and two unidentified persons.
 
 On April 22, Makalai landed in Veraval from Dubai for one month. On May 6, he went into Veraval town from his village, along with his friend Sattar Mohammed Patel. When riding a motorbike, Imran and his two accomplices intercepted Makalai and put a pistol to his head and demanded Rs 3 crore and threatened to kill him if he did not pay.
 
 Makalai took the incident lightly, but in the night, Imran and his men once again intercepted his car near ID Chauhan School and demanded Rs 3 crore. They asked Makalai to pay the money till Monday afternoon and threatened to shoot him otherwise. 
 
 After receiving two threats in a day, Makalai approached police and lodged a complaint against Imran and two others.
