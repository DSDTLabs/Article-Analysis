NEW DELHI: Delhi high court (HC) today issued a notice to all those accused in the  , on an appeal filed by the Enforcement Directorate ( ) and the  . 

 
 The HC has set May 25 as the date for hearing the plea.
 
 The ED moved the Delhi high court on Monday challenging the acquittal of former Union telecom minister A Raja and DMK MP Kanimozhi among others in a money laundering case in the   spectrum scam.
 
 On December 21 last year, a special CBI court acquitted Raja and 18 others, including DMK chief M Karunanidhi’s wife Dayalu Ammal and daughter Kanimozhi, of the offence of money laundering. The court had also ordered release of attached properties in the case worth Rs 223 crore.
 
 The ED’s appeal, filed by its joint director Rajeshwar Singh, said the “special judge committed a grave error by acquitting the accused of the offence under Prevention of Money Laundering Act on the basis of acquittal in the CBI case and without applying mind and considering the 
  offence as a separate, independent and standalone offence to be tried and adjudicated.”
