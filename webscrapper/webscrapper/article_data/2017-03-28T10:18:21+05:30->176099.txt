Panaji: The employment agencies in the   for over 1,400 individuals in various government,   within April and November 2016.

 The office of the commissioner of labour and employment has received over 18,000 new job seekers’ registrations and has notified 2,579 vacancies. In addition to this, the ministry of labour and employment’s model career centre launched at the employment exchange here held two job fairs in 2016 at   industrial estate and Navelim where close to 60 companies participated, looking for candidates to fill about 900 vacancies. While 500 jobs were offered in hospitality, manufacturing and construction sectors, there was a candidate dropout rate of 50% with 222 candidates finally taking up the offers.
 
 The model career centre was launched as part of the Centre’s mission to implement the national career service which is expected to eventually replace the employment exchange. The department of labour and employment had asked employers to register their departments on the national career service portal (www.ncs.gov.in) to get access to a large and reliable data base of job seekers. 
 
 The new portal provides an interface where employers and prospective employees can interact directly. Once registered, a job seeker will receive updates of vacancies and only after they apply will their details be visible to employers.
