NEW DELHI: Signaling a slight thaw in their troubled bilateral relations, India and Pakistan have decided to ensure closer coordination between their coast guards in liberalising procedures for release of each other’s fishermen as well as undertaking search and rescue missions and tackling oil spill disasters or pollution on the high seas. 

 
 This came during a delegation-level meeting, chaired by   (ICG) director general Rajendra Singh and Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) chief Rear Admiral Zaka Ur Rehman, here on Monday. 
 
 This meeting, which is a significant link between the two coastal maritime agencies, was not held last year after   conducted “surgical strikes” against terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir in September 2016 and a Pakistani military court awarded the death sentence to former Indian   officer   in April 2017. 
 
 “The two sides will now stay in regular contact and expeditiously exchange information on maritime boundary violations and nabbing of each other’s fishing boats through the existing hotline between the ICG and PMSA headquarters, instead of merely talking once a week on Wednesdays,” said an official. 
 
 Fishermen from the two countries often stray across the international maritime boundary line in search of “lucrative catches”' and get caught in the bitter tussle between the two countries. Hundreds of them end up in each other’s jails due to the lack of clear demarcation of territorial waters. 
 
 The meeting discussed measures to liberalise procedures for release and repatriation of each other’s fishermen as quickly as possible instead of letting them languish in each other’s jails for months at end.
