In keeping with the tradition of the last few seasons, Indian handloom and textiles will be at fore at the upcoming   in Delhi, which will take place at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. But this season, there will be a special show dedicated to Indonesian textiles and techniques as well.

 For the first time, Indonesian designer   will be showcasing her designs at the prestigious event. To enable cultural and creative exchange between designers from India and  , the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) has collaborated with the Jakarta Fashion Week.

 FDCI president Sunil Sethi says, "The idea behind this collaboration is to give designers from both countries an opportunity to share their craft and techniques with each other. Yunus, who will be showcasing with us on the first day of the fashion week, will be presenting her works in batik, a technique which is very popular in India. Later this year, one of our designers will be participating in Jakarta Fashion Week. We have not finalised the designer yet. I think we will keep it open to all designers of FDCI, and then any one of them can participate or JFW may have a jury to decide on one Indian designer based on his/her work. The collaboration is already so popular that another fashion body from Indonesia has also approached us for a similar partnership."
