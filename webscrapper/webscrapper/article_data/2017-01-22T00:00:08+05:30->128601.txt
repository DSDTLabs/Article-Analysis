  Mornings are about transformation. You can power your day with life-changing habits. The secret to success lies in how you start your day. Early morning, our inner power and mental awareness are at their peak. Our thoughts are clear. To make it easy, create certain habits that make your day energetic. If your mornings are energised, your day and life will be energised too. Smile for 60 seconds and think positive. Smiling strengthens the  . If you wake up with a smile and remember to keep smiling through the day, you’ll ward off diseases. Breathe deeply. This supplies oxygen to your whole body. Spend some time alone and reflect on how you feel. Also set up your daily goals.
  
  Take care of your body. Performing a morning stretching routine will help loosen your muscles. Have a shower, a healthy breakfast and spend time with your loved ones. Take time to taste and smell food.
  
  Before you start reading emails, create something. This can be anything: write a blog post; draw something; write a poem. Do these things every day, and give yourself a break on Sundays. It will soon become a habit. Create a ‘vision board’ and place it in front of your bed. Write your inspiration of the day. It will lead to a happy and fulfilling life.
