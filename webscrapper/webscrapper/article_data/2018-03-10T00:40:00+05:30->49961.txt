Bhopal: The tussle for two Rajya Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh is likely to intensify with Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar filing his nomination papers from Maharashtra, on Friday. The senior party leader was elected to the Rajya Sabha from the state quota in 2012. A day before, the BJPâ€™s central election committee had cleared names of Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Thawar Chand Gehlot for two of the four Rajya Sabha seats from the state. Sources in the BJP said for the remaining two seats, three senior leaders - Makhan Singh, Rakesh Singh Chaturvedi and Ajay Pratap Singh - were the main claimants. Makhan Singh, former state organisational general secretary with strong backing from the Sangh Parivar, was assured by the state leadership for the Rajya Sabha seat. Rakesh Singh Chaturvedi, who quit Congress in 2014 to join BJP, was promised by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for the Upper House seat. Senior state functionary Ajay Pratap Singh, who was tipped off for the coveted post by senior party leaders in Delhi, is also a strong claimant. However, only two of these leaders will get nominated to the Upper House from the state, if the BJP high command does not opt to field for any outsider. Sources in BJP said that BJP leader from Tamil Nadu, La Ganesan, who is retiring from the Upper House on April 2 is also seeking renomination for Rajya Sabha. However, the BJP may not consider Meghraj Jain, who is retiring from the post after his second term and is searching for a new face, they said.
