AHMEDABAD: Consider these numbers. In the last decade   have added 24.59 lakh more vehicles on  . Back in 2007, there were a total 16.3 lakh vehicles registered since early 1950s. While the   for the city has remained 2,600km and will not grow in length any further in near future, Ahmedabad is on the verge of imploding under its own   Today the city has 43 lakh registered vehicles!

 A cursory glance of the number of vehicles registered with road traffic department year on year since 1997 will only reveal the boom in private vehicle ownership. If there were just 3,095 vehicles registered in the whole of 1997, the registration increased to 3.07 lakh vehicles in 2016 and in 2017 about 2.9 lakh vehicles were registered. 
 
 Considered a status symbol till the late 1980s, private vehicles have now become symbols of urban blight! The change came in 2007-08 when the number of registered vehicles increased from 32,000 in 2007 to about 1.14 lakh in 2008.
 
 Shivanand Swamy, executive director, Center for Excellence (CoE) in Urban Transport, CEPT university says factors leading to the sudden boom in vehicle ownership include easy finance support from banks, rising fuel costs, upgradation of technology and better mileage in vehicles, lighter and manoeuvrable two-wheelers, and failure of public transport in meeting mobility demands.
 
 Shivanand adds, “If you were to look at the combined two-wheeler and car ownership in Ahmedabad, it comes to 350 vehicles per 1,000 people. This is close to 400 car owners per 1,000 in Europe, where various European countries have already begun imposing congestion tax. Singapore capped giving licences when their density reached 115 car owners per 1,000 people and have begun auctioning licences only against cars being phased out.” 
 
  
  
 
 He further adds that speaking of cars, Ahmedabad’s average has reached 40 to 50 car owners per 1,000 people, while in case of two wheelers the ownership ranges between 220 to 250 owners per 1,000 people.
 
 “Ahmedabad needs a better and reliable public transport system to curb the problem of rising traffic congestion and pollution. Under the smart city initiative we have introduced electric buses to make public transport comfortable and affordable,” said a senior AMC official.
