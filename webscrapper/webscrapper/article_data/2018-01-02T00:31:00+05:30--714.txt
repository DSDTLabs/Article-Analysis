Pune: Union road transport and highways minister   on Monday said it was not possible to give exemption from toll tax as the government did not have adequate funds.

 “Good roads not only save fuel, but time as well. Therefore, if you want good service, you will have to pay (the toll tax). It is common across the world. At this juncture, I cannot promise toll exemption as the government doesn’t have adequate funds,” Gadkari said after inaugurating the 15th Jagatik Marathi Sammelan in the city. The event was organised by Jagatik Marathi Academy and BVG group.
 
 “Projects like Mumbai- Pune expressway and Worli-Bandra sea link have made people’s live easy,” the minister said, adding that he will inaugurate the six-lane road between Satara and Kolhapur and the tunnel work at Khambatki Ghat section next month.
 
 When asked about his close association with RSS, Gadkari said, “I never hid my association with the RSS. At the same time, I have not given importance to caste and religion in my political career. Therefore, all sections of society have supported me and elected me several times.”
 
 On dynastic politics, the minister said, “I don’t believe in it (dynastic politics). However, in politics, you have to compromise on certain principles and therefore we have to give tickets to relatives and family members of political leaders.” He, added that none of his family members would ever contest the elections in the future.
 
 Meanwhile, Gadkari said the government was exploring a plan to raise Rs 10 trillion from retirees and provident fund beneficiaries. “Our plan is to give 7.75% interest rate to retired women employees of defence services, while retired personnel from other services will get the interest rate of 7.5% on their funds. This interest money will be deposited in their bank accounts every month,” he added.
