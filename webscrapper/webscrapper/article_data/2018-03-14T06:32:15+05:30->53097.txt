AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Universityâ€™s (GU) decision to hold   in the subject of   as per the   has left students studying in   confused.

 This happened because the colleges have taught their students the new syllabus and given them preliminary tests as per the new syllabus prescribed by the university. A month ahead of final exams, GU informed the colleges that the final tests will be conducted as per the old syllabus.
 
 This led the students to make representation before the Controller of Examination as well as the Board of Studies for Economics, but the GU officials informed the students that the decision cannot be changed, sources in GU said.
 
 During their representation before GU authorities, the students placed a circular issued by the university itself which said that the new syllabus should be provided to new students, and old syllabus should be continued for old students.
 
 The issue came to the fore when students of R T Tibrewal College received an SMS a few days ago from the college that the final exam would be conducted as per old syllabus, and all students have been intimated to attend classes because the college would teach the subject afresh as per old syllabus.
