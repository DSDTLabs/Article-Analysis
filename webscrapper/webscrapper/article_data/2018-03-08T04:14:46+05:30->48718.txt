MUMBAI: While it’s known that India has the higher ratio of   airline   than the global  , the percentage of female pilots in   such as Air India, IndiGo, Spice Jet is on a steady rise. 

 Two days ago, IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh tweeted that 25% of the 1,200 women pilots in India work with IndiGo and they account for 14% of IndiGo’s pilots. At 12%, India has the highest average of women airline pilots against the global average of 4-5%, he had tweeted, referring to a December 2017 survey by International Society of Women Airline Pilots. 
 
 National carrier Air India is one of the big recruiters of women pilots. An Air India spokesperson said 13% of its cockpit crew comprised women pilots.
 
 Women comprise more than 12% of Jet Airways’ pilots, said a Jet Airways spokesperson. “The percentage of women pilots has been growing over time. About a decade ago, 7.5% of Jet Airways’ pilots were women. That number has grown over 12.1%, reflecting a progressive increase in women crew,’’ the Jet spokesperson added.
 
 Another airline that is keen on increasing its women pilot number is low-cost carrier Spice Jet. On the eve of International Women’s Day, the airline announced a first of its kind initiative—an exclusive recruitment drive for women pilots for its Boeing 737 and Bombardier Q400 fleet.
 
 The airline has extended an open invite to women pilots across the country as part of the recruitment program held at SpiceJet training Academy in Gurugram on Wednesday and Thursday. “It is open for both captains and first officers having a valid commercial pilot licence,’’ said a Spice Jet spokesperson and added that an all-women selection board comprising the airline’s management lady pilots will conduct the interviews. “With no examination fees attached, the hand-picked candidates will be given the offer letter the very same day.’’
