PUNE: The Directorate   ( ) has asked the Shirdi airport authorities to improve certain aspects before allowing flights at the facility declared “operation ready” around 10 days ago. 

 The DGCA’s orders, which have to be carried out by Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC), has further delayed the start of the much-awaited airport in the temple town. Among the objections and suggestions raised by the DGCA is the need to close the corners of the runway.
 
 “A   visited the airport on Tuesday evening, inspected the facility and left on Friday evening. It has made some observations and we need to work on them. It will take at least 25 days or close to a month to implement what the DGCA wants,” an   told TOI requesting anonymity.
 
 MADC, which has developed and will manage the airport, had never declared a specific date to start flight operations. An MADC official had said last month that the airport was 100% operational ready. 
 
 “The airport cannot start functioning without a licence from the DGCA. We need to work on the DGCA’s suggestions to get the licence. We have been waiting for the inspection for about a month. We cannot ignore the DGCA’s directions and endanger the lives of people,” an MADC official said.
 
 “We will look after the issues raised by DGCA. Care of all facilities has been taken to construct the airport. We want its smooth operations, without any hiccups,” he said, adding that the coprporation will start working on the DGCA’s suggestions from this week. 
 
 “Once our work is done, we will get in touch with DGCA so that it issues the licence. At this point of time, it is difficult to say if a DGCA team will come again for inspection,” the official said.
