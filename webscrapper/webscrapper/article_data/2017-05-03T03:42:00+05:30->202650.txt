Calangute: The state government plans to beautify the Nerul riverside towards Candolim with a walkway along the bundh and provide for various activities and facilities for visitors, said Calangute MLA Michael Lobo.

 Lobo told TOI, in the first stage, the Nerul bridge approach road in Candolim is being converted into a parking lot for tourist taxis and tourist buses. Also, the 1.7 km-long ‘bundh’, which was built along the mangroves and flood plains at Orda, Candolim, three years ago, to prevent flooding of the low-lying areas, will be developed and beautified with a walkway, benches and other facilities for visitors. Visitors will be charged a fee to enter the walkway.
 
 “This project is at the planning stage and work will be undertaken by the water resources department (WRD). The walkway will be on the ‘bundh’ with coffee shops, and other facilities. We’re also thinking of creating a traditional fishing village where people can witness traditional methods of fishing. There will be a place for fishing and canoe rides too,” Lobo said, adding that the walkway would have murals depicting incidents from Goan history and statues of eminent Goans”. 
 
 Lobo said the beautification project, estimated to cost Rs 3 crore, will be ready in about two years. “It will be handed over to the Candolim panchayat for maintenance and an entry fee will be charged which can be spent on the maintenance and garbage collection. People can come and have picnics here, or just come for a relaxing walk,” he said. 
 
 “We’re discussing the project with the locals, the panchayat members, architects, WRD engineers, and will incorporate their suggestions,” he added.
