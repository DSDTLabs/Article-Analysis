KOLKATA: Preparations are on in full swing for the third edition of Jio   East to adjudge the best Bengali films released last year. The announcement for the awards was made by actor Abir Chatterjee at a   mall on Saturday.

 Just a week later, on February 17, the statuettes of the black lady will be given away at a star-studded affair to be organized at Science City. Though the organisers didn’t reveal who would get the Lifetime Achievement award this year, they promised that a surprise was in store.
 
 A nostalgic Chatterjee recalled how he had grown up watching Filmfare Awards. “I still remember how we would try to return home early to watch the telecast of the event,” he said. As many as 100 films are competing to be nominated for the coveted awards in 25 categories. While there will be 10 awards in the popular categories, the remaining will be given in the technical, critics and writing categories. With the lines between popular and critically acclaimed cinema getting blurred, the organisers said the jury was having a challenging time deciding on the winners. “I can vouch for the transparency of this award,” said the actor, emphasizing how happy he was with the way the awards recognize the contribution of technicians. “They are our real heroes,” he added.
 
 Last year, Chatterjee hosted the show along with actor Jisshu Sengupta. This year, Chatterjee will return to host the show with actor  .
 
 “As hosts, we will do our bit of leg-pulling, but without hurting anyone,” the actor promised.
