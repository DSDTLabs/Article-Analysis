AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of two ships located 90km from   port, after the crews of the vessels complained that they were not been paid by the shipping company and that they are terribly short of supplies.

 Two vessels – MT Nautical Global VII and MV Nautical Global XVI – both flying   flag, are owned by the   FZC. Both ships are in Indian waters. On intervention being sought by 41 crew members of both ships including their captains, Justice Biren Vaishnav ordered the arrest of the vessels along with hulls, engines, gears, tackles, bunkers, machinery, apparel, plants furniture, equipment and all appurtenances.
 
 The HC directed the port officer and   authorities at Kandla to execute the arrest, seizure and detention of the vessels.
 
 This came after the crew members filed an admiralty suit in the HC, complaining that the vessels, flying the Panama flag, have been abandoned by the shipping company and the owner for various reasons. Their supplies have diminished slowly, whereas the shipping company is bound to supply fuel, food, drinking water and other bare necessities as well as their wages. They complained that their wages have not been paid for quite some time, said their advocate Punam Gadhvi.
 
 The crew members, all of them Indian, also submitted that due to the climate in this part of the world, there is a threat to their health and it has become difficult and unhygienic to remain on ship. They have claimed dues of $108,000 from the employers, with 12% interest. The crew and captains also sought permission to leave the ships because of the failed circumstances.
 
 The HC has ordered the arrest of the ships and kept further hearing in June. The court said that only payment of dues to the crew members can spare the vessels from being arrested.
