Fatehgarh Sahib: For the way he has utilized 17 acres of his land for floriculture, 39-year-old Gurwinder Singh Sohi from Nanowal village in the district has received Sardarni Parkash Kaur Saran Award â€“ the national award for innovative farmer -- from the Punjab governor. Gurwinder, who previously sowed wheat and paddy in nine acres of his land turned a floriculturist and took additional land on lease to grow gladioli and marigold flowers. The flower crop has fetched him Rs 31 lakh a year. After completing school, he could not clear the Joint Entrance Test (JET) for engineering but refused to join the family business of wheat-paddy cultivation. In 2008, he learnt about subsidies being given by the Punjab horticulture department on Holland gladiolas seeds and started growing the same on two kanals of his land. Having found it profitable, he kept adding acres under the Holland gladiolus that started reaping more benefits. He flourished by exploring new markets in Chandigarh, Sanghol, Ludhiana and Patiala. He said last season he grew gladioli on 12 acres and fetched Rs 2 lakh per acre and marigold got him Rs 1.25 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh per acre. He also ventured into online trade of flowers and made good profits by selling through social media sites.
