MUMBAI: State-run   in   will on Tuesday apply to   (MCI) seeking 44   for its  . Presently, it has 15 seats.

 This application follows MCI’s special notification on May 19 giving government medical colleges “one more chance” for a “one-time increase in seats in superspeciality courses under revised teacher-student ratio in medical colleges (already running superspeciality courses) for 2017-18”.
 
 Grant Medical College dean Dr T P Lahane said his institute would seek an increase of 38 seats across seven superspecialties —cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, neurology, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, paediatric surgery and urology. “We will also ask MCI to consider giving us six superspecialty seats in the nephrology department, which has so far never offered the course,” he added.
 
 The MCI call is a part of the Centre’s drive to improve the poor doctor-patient ratio—it is poorer in superspecialty fields.
 
 JJ Hospital has three seats in cardiology and wants 10 more seats. “We have two seats in neurology and want three more, while we have to increase four more seats in our neurosurgery department, which has only one seat now,” said Dr Lahane. The demand for other specialties are eight for cardiothoracic, five for paediatric surgery, five for urology, and three for plastic surgery. 
 
 “The JJ proposal will be sent to MCI on Tuesday, the last date for submission,” said Dr Pravin Shingare, who heads the state department of medical education and research. The JJ Group of Hospitals also include Cama, G T and St George’s hospitals.
