AMARAVATI: The controversy over the suspension of   refuses to die down with both the ruling and opposition parties not looking for an amicable solution. 

 Even though the suspension period is not yet over, the Nagari MLA is attending the assembly sessions in the last two days. As of now, the matter rests with assembly speaker  , who is yet to take a call on the recommendations of the privileges committee. It is believed that the committee recommended extension of the suspension for another year if Roja does not tender an apology for the remarks made against TDP Dalit legislator Vangalapudi Anitha and chief minister  .
 
 Legislative affairs minister   echoed the same and said Roja must apologise to the house for the punishment to be waived. "We will consider the committee's report but the house will decide on the future course," Yanamala said. 
 
 Meanwhile, Roja has made it clear that under no circumstances will she apologise to Anitha. Speaking to mediapersons, Roja alleged that chief whip   had stolen the video footage from the assembly library and doctored it to portray her in a bad light. "How could they punish me without making the original tapes public? The speaker should punish the chief whip," she said.
