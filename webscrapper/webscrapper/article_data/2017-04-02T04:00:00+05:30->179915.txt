Ahmedabad: A routine protest by Congress councillors at the civic body over alleged irregularities in multi-crore EWS and affordable housing projects turned to a war of words between Ahmedabad municipal commissionerMukesh Kumar and the Congressmen. 

 Kumar had observed that he expected some decorum from the Congressmen while representing civic matters. The matter worsened when Jamalpur Congress corporator, Shahnawaz Sheikh, lost his cool and started accusing Kumarâ€™s municipal team of corruption. 
 
 Kumar told opposition leader Dinesh Sharma to escort Sheikh out of his chamber. While the Congressmen struggled with Sheikh, Kumar took the memorandum and assured that the CAG observations into alleged irregularities will be looked into.
