BHOPAL: Automated teller machines (ATMs ) in the Chambal region of Madhya Pradesh continue to dispense   notes. After a Rs 2,000 note with Mahatma Gandhi’s image missing was received from an ATM in Sheopur earlier this week, which was the third case since January, an ATM in the neighbouring district of Morena ‘dumped’ Bapu from two Rs 500 notes.

 The State Bank of India branch termed these to be ‘misprinted’ notes. It said that they would be replaced after being sent to the RBI.
 
 On Friday night, Gowardhan Sharma, a resident of Morena, received these notes from the SBI ATM at Nalla number 2 of the city. A bewildered Sharma showed the notes to the security guard and then called up on the phone numbers available at the ATM.
 
 Sharma later told media that he was asked to wait and added that only RBI would be able to address the issue. As he waits for the note to be exchanged, bank officials were not available for comments.
 
 Earlier on April 23, Purshottam Naagar, a farmer of Chandrapura village in Sheopur district had received a Rs 2,000 illegal tender from the SBI e-corner located on Shivpuri road. He had deposited a cheque in an SBI branch of the city. Between 12.02 pm and 12.17 pm, he made four withdrawals amounting to a total of Rs 40,000. But when he checked the notes, Gandhi’s image was missing from one of them, he said.
