 Salem: Tamil Nadu Makkal Urimai Katchi (TMUK) president Poomozhi on Saturday petitioned the President Pranab Mukherjee and Union home minister Rajnath Singh to appoint a full-time governor for Tamil Nadu.
 
 Talking to TOI, Poomozhi said the state did not have a full-time governor as well as a chief minister for the past few months. “The sad part is that the central government is unable to find a governor for more than five months,” he lamented.
 
 Pointing out that both Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were big and important states, Poomozhi said, “It’s very hard for a governor to monitor both the states, especially given the political situation unfolding in Tamil Nadu.”
 
 Recalling acting governor Vidyasagar Rao’s recent visit to Coimbatore for a private event, Poomozhi said the governor had to cut short his visit to Udhagamandalam to leave for New Delhi on the same day. “If there has been a full-time governor, s/he would have stayed back,” he added.
 
 The party also petitioned Vidyasagar Rao to invite the leader claiming majority support for the floor test in the assembly and also to form the government.
