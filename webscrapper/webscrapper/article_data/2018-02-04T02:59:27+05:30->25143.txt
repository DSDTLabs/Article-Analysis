NEW DELHI:   accused   of carrying out a political witch-hunt against opposition leaders to “divert people’s attention from its failures” and “save the NDA government from a public backlash in the 2019 LS elections”, a day after the CBI filed a chargesheet against former Haryana CM B S Hooda and filed an appeal in the   against a 2004 Delhi high court ruling to bury the case.

 AICC spokesman Randeep   said, “The decision of the Delhi high court in the Bofors case established how Congress leadership, including (former PM)  , was a victim of the smear campaign of BJP decades ago.” 
 
 Surjewala added that attorney general K K Venugopal had also said there was no evidence or truth in the case.
 
 Referring to the Hooda case, he added, “Political witch-hunt, vendetta and malicious intent to seek revenge has blinded the Narendra Modi-led government and the Manohar Lal Khattar-led Haryana government in registering a series of criminal cases against Congress leaders across the country... The... false criminal cases being filed against Congress leaders exposes the sinister hallmark of the   government’s style of functioning,” he said.
