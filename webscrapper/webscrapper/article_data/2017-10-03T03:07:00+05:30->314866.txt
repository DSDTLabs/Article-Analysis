Ponda: The Shivaji fortress at Farmagudi-Ponda junction will be reconstructed within two years at an expense of Rs 2 crore, art and culture minister Govind Gaude said on Monday, after visiting and inspecting the site. The tourism department has already floated a tender for the work, he said. The current structure, with a statue of Maratha king Shivaji on horseback, is a few decades old and has been built at the site of an old fortress constructed by Muslim rulers. The structure was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1549, according to records. The tourism department is set to take up the project after two months and complete it before Shivaji Jayanti in 2019. “Besides reconstruction, the fortress would be beautified and there would be a gallery housing inscriptions on the history of the fortress,” Gaude said.
