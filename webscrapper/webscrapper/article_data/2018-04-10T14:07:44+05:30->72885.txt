SURAT: A police inspector (PI) and a constable of Umra police station were suspended and another police inspector was transferred by city police commissioner   over negligence in providing security to Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas   during his press conference at   on Sunday. 

 D J Kubawat, police inspector and Paresh Dhiru, constable, were suspended and S B Bharwad, police inspector, also of Umra police station was transferred to Surat airport. D H Gor, who is posted at Surat airport, has been transferred to Umra police station.
 
 Kubawat was in charge of police bandobast at the Circuit House while the constable was absent. Sharma had ordered an inquiry after some people created a ruckus at the press conference of Athawale. The protesters entered the room where Athawale was talking to reporters and put a black cloth around his neck. One of the protesters happened to be the son of a   municipal councillor.
 
 “The failure of police is obvious. How can anyone go and create disturbance when there is so much security? A police inspector and a constable have been suspended for negligence. Another PI was transferred because being the senior PI of the police station, he should have taken care of the security arrangements for the minister. A departmental inquiry will also be conducted against the officers and further action taken on the basis of the report,” Sharma said.
