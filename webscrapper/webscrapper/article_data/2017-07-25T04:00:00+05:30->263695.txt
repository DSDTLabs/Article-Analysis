Vadodara: An alleged illegal construction in the Brahmeshwar Mahadev temple in Wadi area of the city has sparked a major row at Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). Even representations by a former deputy mayor from the ruling BJP seem to be making no impact.

 Former deputy mayor and BJP councillor Sunita Shukla has been raising the issue since quite some time now. Shukla said that a building permission was obtained in 2003-04 in the name of Vishnu Bhatt, the trustee of Brahmeshwar Mahadev temple in Wadi area of the city. Bhatt had passed away in 1967.
 
 Shukla said that this had come to light in 2008 itself and the building permission was cancelled by the then municipal commissioner M K Das. “The department of the civic body, however, later treated the application as that for impact fee to regularise unauthorised construction. The fact is that the ground-plus-one construction is a reconstruction,” she said.
 
 Shukla added that after Das had cancelled the building permission, the VMC had even started paperwork to raze the building. “It had even asked the temple trust to pay Rs 15,000 for razing the unauthorised construction,” Shukla said.
