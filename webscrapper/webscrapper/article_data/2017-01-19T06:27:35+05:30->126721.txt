NEW DELHI: After taking over as   president, UP CM   has the uphill task of keeping out dons like   and Atiq Ahmed as party candidates in the assembly polls, overlooking their appeal among minority voters in the state's eastern region.

 Akhilesh had revolted against father   over several issues, including the two don-turned-politicians making it to the list of candidates for the polls. Mukhtar's   has merged with SP and Atiq was made the party candidate from Kanpur Cantonment, although he belongs to Allahabad.
 
 Mulayam's recent outburst that Akhilesh was anti-Muslim and had tried to stall appointment of a Muslim as state police chief also stems from the CM's specific reservations about Mukhtar and Atiq.
 
 Sitting MLA from Mau in eastern UP, Mukhtar and his brother Afzal hold sway over the minority population in three-four districts, including Ghazipur, Azamgarh and Ballia. The weaving community swears by the brothers despite Mukhtar being in jail for several years.
 
 During Lok Sabha polls, Afzal had contested from Ballia as Qaumi Ekta Dal's candidate. Other than the "Modi wave", Afzal's presence was seen as a key factor in the defeat of SP candidate Neeraj Shekhar, who lost the seat known as a family pocket-borough.
 
 Atiq is equally powerful in Allahabad and Kanpur regions, with strong appeal among minority voters and the Mulayam-Shivpal combine had roped in the two dons to safeguard the party's traditional winning combine of Muslim-Yadav - M-Y factor.
 
 Party insiders said one of the several issues on which father-son had differences was the fast changing strategy towards safeguarding the M-Y factor.
