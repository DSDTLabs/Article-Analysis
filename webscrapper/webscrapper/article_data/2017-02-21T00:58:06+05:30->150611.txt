NEW DELHI: The government has started preparing a roadmap for building 8,000km of pavements and laying more cycle tracks in 106 cities in the next five years to promote   and to reduce  . 

 The urban development ministry targets building these infrastructures, lay 1,300km bus rapid transit (BRT) corridors with dedicated fast lanes for buses, set up 500 new bus depots and promote use of electric and hybrid vehicles under Green Transport Scheme. 
 
 Sources said the scheme will involve investment worth nearly Rs 80,000 crore and will benefit about 22 crore  . 
 
 The urban development ministry has floated a detailed proposal for discussion and for carrying out the preparatory work. In the first phase, cities with population over 5 lakh will be covered.
 
 Considering that the scheme wonâ€™t be successful unless cities have necessary rules and regulations in place, so to enable cities to get financial incentive from Centre, the states are required to have and implement a parking policy, adopt street vendor regulation norms, have a policy to prevent encroachments and also have an urban transport fund.
 
 The Centre will set up   (NGUMF), which will channelise 60% funds from central government and other agencies to cities covered under this scheme. 
 
 This entity will contribute to 60% of the entire investment required for the mission, which is around 48,000 crore and the rest 32,000 crore will come from states.
