NEW DELHI:  , the 39-year-old offender in the gruesome serial killing of six people including a pregnant woman, was arrested on Tuesday after his release from Safdarjung Hospital. He is being interrogated to establish the sequence of events and the situation that led him to attack the victims.

 Dhankar told the Special investigating Team from Palwal that he could not control his anger after being “mistreated by his wife and in-laws”. Earlier this week, a police team had visited his apartment at Omaxe City in Palwal to locate his mobile phone and scan the texts and calls made before the murderous spree. Prescriptions and medicine samples were also found at the house. 
 
 The accused claimed that he was unwell and had run out of medicines and food due to which he had gone to the in-laws house to ask his wife to return. But when she refused, he lost his temper. 
 
 He sat outside the house from 11pm to 1am following which he picked up the rod from a construction site next to the house and went on the bludgeoning spree. He claimed that he had gone to the hospital hoping to find a place to sleep and found the woman on the bench. He first asked her to move, but when she refused, he hit her with the rod. He turned mad when others tried to catch him and then attacked random people on the road.
 
 Family members said that Dhankar’s wife, Seema, used to stay at her parents’ house on weekends in Palwal’s Adarsh Nagar to avoid confrontation with him. “This has been going on for the past six months,” said his nephew  . “He told us that he did not eat for days because   did not leave any food for him. He was also off medicines for nearly a year.”
