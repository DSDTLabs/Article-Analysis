PATIALA: SAD candidate from   constituency and former Army chief General   has got a case registered against Col Amar Singh (retd) for criminal intimidation and wrongful restraint. 

 The case has been registered at the Patiala Civil Lines police station under sections 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. In his complaint, Gen Singh said   had not allowed him to garland the statue of his (Col) grandfather freedom fighter Sewa Singh Thikriwala, who was the leader of Praja Mandal Movement. 
 
 Gen Singh had to face some awkward moments during his poll campaigning on January 23, when Col Singh did not let him garland the statue. He said he had reported the matter to police two days after the incident at Thikriwala Chowk.
 
 Speaking to TOI on Thursday, the SAD candidate said, “Col Singh has disrupted my election campaign not once, but on a number of occasions. He is working at the behest of Captain  , as he is closely related to him.”
 
 The former Army chief had taken out a cycle rally in the town during which he was to garland Thikriwala’s statue. But Col Singh had not allowed him to do so, saying he would not let anyone take a political mileage by exploiting the name of his grandfather.
 
 The Gen contended that the statue was a national property and nobody could stall his move to pay homage to a national figure. “He had not only wrongly restrained me from exercising my right to honour a national hero, but had also intimidated me with criminal intentions,” General Singh said.
 
 Col Singh could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.
