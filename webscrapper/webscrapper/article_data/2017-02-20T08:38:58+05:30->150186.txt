IMPHAL: Activists of the All Manipur Students' Union (Amsu) on Sunday staged a protest near the venue of Union home minister Rajnath Singh's poll rally and sought details of the framework agreement signed between the Centre and the   (Isak-Muivah). 

 The activists staged a similar protest near the   auditorium at Palace Gate when Singh was releasing BJP's vision document for the polls. 
 
 The protesters carried placards reading, "No politics on the integrity of Manipur." Police, however, confined the activists to DM College gate, next to Thau ground in Thangmeiband where Singh addressed his rally.
 
 Speaking to the media, Amsu secretary general Manjit Sarangthem said the home minister's assurance that the framework agreement had no mention of Manipur was unconvincing. 
 
 "Why can't the Centre put the agreement out in the public domain?" he asked.
