PANAJI: In a bid to satiate the thirst of   in the   during summer, the   has built a number of  , which are   to maintain a good level. 

 The officials believe this would also help prevent man-animal conflict in the areas around Bondla, even before it surfaces, the forest department has dug a few holes to make alternative arrangement of water for the wild animals.
 
 “We are supplementing water in some areas of Bondla wildlife sanctuary and its neighbouring forest area in Shivdem. The water is refilled in these waterholes every alternate day,” a wildlife official told STOI.
 
 Officials have built 10 such artificial holes, each of which can hold 40 litres of water. They will continue to replenish them till the first week of June when the monsoon is likely to hit the state.
 
 Besides helping wild animals quench their thirst, the initiative also ensures that the animals don’t venture out of their habitat to enter human settlements, thus, containing their urge to move into orchards and village areas. “Though we haven’t faced any man-animal conflict in Bondla yet, we have taken up the artificial waterhole initiative as a preventive measure,” a source from the sanctuary said. STOI had reported on Wednesday that the quest for water had pushed a number of gaurs from their habitat into the village areas.
 
  Forest department officials rescued a gaur at Molem on Monday and another one at Sacorda last week. Both were led back into the wild after being rescued and hydrated.
 
 Forest officials now plan to expand the initiative to other areas next season. “We will carry on with this drive more extensively next year and try to penetrate other areas in the state, too.” the wildlife official added.
