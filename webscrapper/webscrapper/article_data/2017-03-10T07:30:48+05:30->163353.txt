HYDERABAD: The   on Thursday directed the   in Hyderabad not to start   in the Ramky, Vanpic and individual investors chargesheets pertaining to   disproportionate assets case till March 17. The CBI court is scheduled to start this process this week and it has to wait for further orders of the HC which will hear the matter again on March 14. 

 Justice M Seetharama Murti gave this interim order while hearing three petitions filed by Jagathi publications, the publishers of Sakshi Telugu daily, which is seeking a combined trial in all the 11 charge sheets filed by CBI in the case. The senior counsel appearing for Jagati told the court that though the HC ordered stay of proceedings in 8 charge sheets, the trial court is proceeding further in respect of the remaining three charge sheets and is about to commence the charges framing session. We will be forced to disclose our defence now itself if the trial begins in a piece meal manner and that will jeopardise our case at the stage of trial in other charge sheets, Jagathi advocates D V Sitarama Murthy, T Niranjan Reddy and S Sriram told the court that to ensure a fair trial, there should be a combined trial. 
 
 CBI counsel P Kesava Rao told the court that the petitions filed by Jagathi are not maintainable. The judge while observing that it takes time to decide the technical issues sought to know from the CBI counsel whether it is al right for him to wait for a week to enable the court to arrive at a just conclusion. With the CBI counsel too agreeing, the judge directed the CBI court not to commence the charges framing session for a week.
