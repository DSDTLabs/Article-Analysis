NEW DELHI: The rain definitely did not dampen enthusiasm at Jawaharlal Nehru University on Thursday, where students gorged themselves on exotic offerings at the  , an annual feature of the   in the institution. 

 Rain paid put to the stalls being erected on the grassy lawns outside  , but to the gourmands it only meant a short walk to the new venue, the School of International Studies, where there was fare from 15 countries awaiting them. In the spirit of traditional home-style cooking, members of the   of JNU had prepared the dishes themselves.
 
 Cuisine of Armenia, South Korea, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Tibet, Thailand, Russia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Nepal and Syrian Arab Republic pampered the palate of students and staff, with the first stall put up and the first bestseller of the day being the momos prepared by Tibetan students. But Ghapama - pumpkin cooked with rice and dry fruits by Armenian students - quickly caught the attention of the eaters.
 
 Among the most popular was the South Korean stall with its live counter. From Korean-style sushi to Bibimbap (a unique rice and vegetables dish) and the innovative kimchi paratha, the food had people wanting more. Heejoo, an undergraduate student in the School of Languages, said, "Our set menu tried to offer as many varieties of food as we generally have at home."
 
 To add to the atmosphere, there was a sideshow of cultural performances from across the world, with students presenting songs and dances from their countries.
 
 There was also a stall belonging to Unnoticed JNU, which was selling salads and snacks, but also folders and hand-painted greeting cards. Unnoticed JNU is an NGO formed by students to take care of children of labourers working on the various construction sites on the campus. The NGO, which supports the kids in their education, collected a fair amount for their objective. And for many, that was as deeply satisfying as the piquant kimchi.
