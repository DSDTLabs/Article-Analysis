Holi might be over but Kanpurites are still enjoying the festival. A social club recently organised a happening Holi party for its club members. "This is my favourite festival and nothing could be better than celebrating it with friends and family," said,  , one of the key organisers of the party, who played a warm host and was seen welcoming the guests along with wife  . Soon after everyone arrived, the guests started playing colours with each other.   and Apoorva were initially a bit hesitant about playing with colours, but soon both got into the act. The members also shook a leg on 'Balam Pichkaari' and 'Rang Barse'. "These songs have a magical impact on you. They put you in a festive mood altogether," said  . We also spotted Ela, Tanvi, Kalpana, Shruti and Renu playing Holi with each other. 
The highlight of the party was santre ki thandai which was a hit with the guests. Also present at the party were  , Nikku, Anish, Rita and Lucky.
