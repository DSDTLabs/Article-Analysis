PATNA: The State Health Society (SHS) has asked all district magistrates and heads of civic bodies to remove hoardings advertising   products in their respective jurisdictions.

 A letter to this effect was issued by SHS executive director Lokesh Kumar Singh on March 28. Singh asked the DMs and civic bodies to implement tobacco control regulations in the state under Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003. Under section 5 of COTPA, direct and indirect advertisement and propaganda of tobacco products are banned. 
 
 Executive director of Socio-Economic and   (SEEDS), Deepak Mishra, who is engaged in an anti-tobacco campaign in the state, said, “Surrogate advertisement of tobacco products is still a big problem. The central and state governments are trying to implement COTPA stringently to curb sale of tobacco.”
 
 He added display of cigarette boxes in paan shops also violates COTPA. “Some companies have come up with other forms of surrogate advertising by launching two products – one with tobacco and one without it – with the same brand name and same colour. While they advertise non-tobacco products, they go for advertisement of tobacco products as well,” Mishra said.
 
 As per the recently released Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2 (GATS-2) 2016-17, there has been a decrease in consumption of tobacco products in  . From 53.5% in 2010, it came down to 25.8% in 2016. 
 
 The state has already banned manufacture, distribution, trade, sale, purchase and advertisement of tobacco products and items containing nicotine and not approved by the   (DCGI). With the introduction of GST, the tax slab on tobacco products has increased from 5% to 28%.
 
 Sale of loose cigarettes was banned in February this year. The state government had even banned sale of e-cigarettes in January this year.
