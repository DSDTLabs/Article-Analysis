PANAJI: The shrine of Bodgeshwar in   is yet again decorated with flowers, lamps and lights as the   unfolds today for the 83rd year. The annual fair of the wish-fulfilling deity attracts thousands of devotees from different walks of life. 

 This year will also mark the 25th year of the installation of the statue of the deity in the Mapusa-based temple. Until then, people worshipped the   in the temple.
 
 Legend has it that the deity would stroll around a certain route of Mapusa at precisely 12am daily. This was at a time when people wouldn’t venture out after dark. Residents along the route would often keep coconuts or beedis (local cigarettes) for him. “Every morning, the beedi would disappear and people believed it was the deity himself who used it,” said Mahesh Rane, a resident of Mapusa. Even today some people claim to see him strolling, but the things left for him are untouched. 
 
 It is believed that Bodgeshwar bestows blessings on newly-weds, owners of new vehicles, students answering exams and those in distress. Agriculturalists residing in the area pray for a better produce by offering bananas and coconuts. The business community still visits the temple every Sunday for good fortune. Besides farmers, fisherfolk, rickshaw and tempo drivers worship the deity by way of a pooja during the festival. 
 
 Observed in the Hindu month of Paush, the fair following the two-day festival will continue till Sunday.
