CHENNAI: Vegetable prices at neighbourhood stores have gone up by 30% with the arrival of summer. The rising temperature has caused a fall in groundwater level and reduced crop yield. The   wholesale vegetable market, which used to receive 400-450 truckloads of vegetables every day three months ago, received only 350 loads on Friday.

 In three months, the price of green beans has gone up from Rs15-Rs20 per kg to Rs30-Rs50 per kg at the Koyambedu market. At neighbourhood retail stores, green beans was selling for Rs60 per kg on Friday.
 
 Yield from the year’s second crop (April to June) is 30% less than the yield from first crop which is harvested from December to March. Prices of tomato, beetroot, cauliflower, radish and turnip have increased by about 30%, while prices of onion, sambar onion, capsicum and brinjal have decreased marginally. Prices of all vegetables will rise from the third week of April by 10%, according to Koyambedu Wholesale Traders’ Welfare Association treasurer P G M Sukumar.
 
 Sukumar said, “Prices began to go up from the first week of March last year due to a failed monsoon. This year, however, prices will only rise gradually, thanks to sufficient rainfall.” Except for coastal Andhra, all other parts of the southern peninsula registered normal rainfall during the recent northeast monsoon.
 
 Prices of tomato in April last year was Rs18, while this year it is only Rs10-Rs12. Likewise, the price of carrot was Rs35 last year compared to Rs15-Rs20 this year.
