MUMBAI: Bombay high court has asked   not to take action against  , a hospice offering palliative care to terminally-ill cancer patients in  , over property tax payment. 

 The hospice challenged BMC's revised bill fixing the capital value of the property at Rs 181 crore and demanding per half-yearly property tax of Rs 9 lakh since April 2015.
 
 In September 2014, the HC had granted a temporary stay when the capital value was fixed at Rs 146 crore and the hospice was directed to pay over Rs 6 lakh per half-yearly from April 2010. This was subject to the hospice continuing to pay water benefit tax, sewerage benefit tax and tree cess of nearly Rs 5 lakh yearly.
 
 The petition said while fixing capital value of the property, BMC has purported to apply the ready reckoner rate of commercial properties in Bandra. The land was leased to it by the government for 99 years on a nominal rent of Re 1 exclusively for construction of a terminal care centre for cancer patients. Considering its charitable nature, BMC exempted it from paying general tax, education cess, employment cess and street tax. But it recovered water benefit tax, sewerage benefit tax and tree cess as part of property tax computed on rateable value as there was no provision for exemption under BMC Act.
 
 The petition also said the hospice was run on donations and provided free service to poor patients irrespective of religion and there was no way it could be commercially developed. "The right of admission is free for everyone," its advocate told a bench of justices   and Riyaz Chagla on April 10.
 
 As BMC's advocate Suresh Pakale sought time to take instruction from the civic administration, the judges posted the matter for April 24 to decide on granting the hospice interim relief. "Are you taking any action? ... Inform them not to take action till then,'' justice Oka told Pakale.
