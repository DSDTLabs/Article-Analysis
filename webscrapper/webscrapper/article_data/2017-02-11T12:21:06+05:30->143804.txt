The gang’s kingpin Subodh Kant Ishwar Prasad Singh alias Kumar Gaurav alias Abhishek Singh’s wife Janhvi has been arrested in the matter so far by city police. 
 
 The West Bengal police, which is learnt to have been after the gang since December last year after they robbed a gold finance company, had taken into custody Sasanth Singh and Manoj Kumar in Andhra Pradesh to begin the operation. This was followed with arrest of Mukesh Prasad. The arrest of the trio led to the spilling of beans regarding the presence of Thakur Anurag Kumar Singh, alias Jacky and Sunny Kumar Singh on the beach from where the duo was arrested. Half dozen firearms and around 90 cartridges have been also seized.
 
 DCP (crime) T Ravi Kumar Murthy of Vizag, while talking to TOI, said mastermind Subodh Kant had travelled to Vizag but gave the cops a slip after sensing something was amiss. “He is expected to have returned to Bihar,” he said. 
 
 It was also reliably learnt that West Bengal police now have launched an operation in Bihar to nab Subodh Kant. City police too had spent several days in Bihar in search of the kingpin.
