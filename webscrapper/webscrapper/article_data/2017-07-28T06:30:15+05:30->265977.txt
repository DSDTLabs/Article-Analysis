PUNE: The   on Thursday took over the investigations into the   against Congress leader  , the  , from the Vishrambaug police.

 Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Dahane told TOI that the case had been transferred from the police station to the crime branch. “A senior woman police officer will be investigating the case,” Dahane said.
 
 The probe was transferred after city police commissioner Rashmi Shukla issued an order on Thursday morning.
 
 Tilak was booked after a 41-year-old woman lawyer lodged an FIR with Vishrambaug police on July 17, accusing him of rape and other criminal offences.
 
 According to sources in the police, one of the reasons behind the transfer of the probe was the absence of any woman police officer in the Vishrambaug police station. The transfer will also reduce the undue pressure on Vishrambaug police considering the sensitivity of the matter.
 
 “Tilak comes from a politically influential family and the police want to avoid any controversy, allegations, mudslinging or miscommunication. At the same time, the woman complainant is a lawyer. Hence, the case has been transferred to the crime branch,” a police officer said.
