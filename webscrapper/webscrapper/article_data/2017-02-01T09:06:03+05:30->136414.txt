JAIPUR: Departments in   government not only failed to spend the money sanctioned in the   but also about 52% of the total funds provisioned under centrally sponsored schemes ( ) remained largely unspent.

 As per the available figures, out of Rs 19,625 crore provisioned for CSS, only Rs 9,565 crore were put into use. Among major projects, funds sanctioned under Swachh Bharat Mission were Rs 1,206 crore. However, only Rs 639 crore were utilized by the state. Similarly, in horticulture department, provision of Rs 162 crore was made out of which state received Rs 95 crore and spent only Rs 36 crore. For the agriculture department too, CSS funds were not used optimally. Provision of Rs 1,265 crore was made, however, only Rs 544 crore were sanctioned out of which department spent Rs 106 crore. In national rural livelihood mission, Rajasthan had a provision of Rs 158 crore but only Rs 32 crore were used from the kitty.
 
 According to the officials, the CSS pool is released only when concerned department makes effort to get it sanctioned and use it optimally. “Departments with better performance and networking with the Union ministry are likely to draw more money from the CSS funds. Once allotted, it should be used to get further money allotted for the scheme,” said an official. 
 
 From the state budget, in nine months, the government has been able to spend only 55.78% of the sanctioned plan budget, with agriculture and public works departments lagging far behind.
