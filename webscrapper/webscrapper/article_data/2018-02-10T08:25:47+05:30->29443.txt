NEW DELHI: The IAF group captain “honey-trapped” on Facebook to pass on secret information to Pakistan’s   appears to have fallen for one of the oldest tricks in the book: one of the two “women” on Facebook stepped on his ego.

 “How do I trust you that you’re not an imposter but a Group Captain of the  ,” Mahima Patel asked Grp Capt Arun Marwaha on Facebook Messenger. The questioning of his identity and rank by a “young woman” was, it seems, enough to tick off Marwaha who then proceeded to satisfy the “young woman” about his identity by leaking sensitive information.
 
 A day after TOI reported on how two Facebook profiles — in the names of Mahima Patel and Kiran Randhwa — had honey-trapped IAF Grp Capt Marwaha into sharing classified information, police are trying to retrieve and analyse his chats, most of which he has deleted from his mobile phone. It is uncertain whether the Facebook profiles actually belong to women by those names pictured in the profiles.
 
 The special cell is in the process of writing to Facebook and WhatsApp seeking information about the content of these deleted chats. If they get the information they seek, it will be strong evidence against Marwaha and will reveal in greater detail the kind of information Marwaha allegedly shared with ISI operatives, sources said.
 
 Police are also trying to ascertain the IP addresses of the devices from which “Kiran” and “Mahima” were logging in. 
 
 This will be difficult as the ISI is known to use IP-masking tactics and proxy servers to obscure the trail. The details of the SIM card he had bought and passed on to one of the women is also being sought from the service provider. Police are also trying to trace the women whose photographs were used by alleged ISI operatives.
