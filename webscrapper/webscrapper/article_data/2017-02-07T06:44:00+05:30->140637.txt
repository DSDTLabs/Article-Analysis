ROHTAK: A day after controversy erupted over an audio clip in which Hansi sub-divisional magistrate (SDM)   was allegedly heard saying that Jat protesters were spewing venom against the government, the Hisar district administration sent the officer on 10 days’ leave.

 Hisar deputy commissioner Nikhil Gajraj said the   had gone on leave for 10 days due to family reasons. 
 
 In the audio clip, the SDM was allegedly heard complaining to top government officers over the phone, saying the Jat agitation in Hisar could go out of control but he would not let them burn Hansi even at the cost of his own life. 
 
 The said conversation had gone viral on social media and generated much controversy over the officer reporting to his seniors -- whether he was giving correct facts or misreporting to score points for his personal gains. 
 
 His alleged conversation was recorded in three different audio tapes, including the one in which he got into a heated debate with a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) for not following his orders. 
 
 Refusing use of any foul language,   (AIJASS) state spokesperson   said when their national convener   had gone to the protest spot in Hansi, media persons were present there. “The officer in question might want to mislead the government for destabilising our protest that was gaining momentum by the day,” he said.
 
 Malik urged the government to verify the facts submitted by their officers in districts before acting on them.
