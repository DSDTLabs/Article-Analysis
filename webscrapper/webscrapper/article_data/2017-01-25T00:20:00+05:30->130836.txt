 Bhopal: Her family had to mortgage jewellery so that she could contest in an international event in 2016. In 2017, she will be contesting against a Russian boxer as a professional. Meet our own Rocky Balboa. The 22-year-old,   Rajput, daughter of a sepoy in home guard, will debut professional circuit of women boxing on January 24 at Tatya Tope stadium.
 
 On one hand, she is to take on Russia’s Panian trained by a full-fledged team of coaches and trainers, than on the other hand she travels by city bus to practice at Tatya Tope stadium.
 
 Purnima’s father Anand Singh Rajput, a resident of Kolar had to leave studies after class 11 while her mother Kusum Singh Rajput could not study beyond class 6th.
 
 Last year Anand had to stop driving auto rickshaw as he was not able to do it with the job.
 
 “Just couple of years back buying a boxing kit was a distant dream for my family. It is the support of family that made it possible for me to reach this stage,” said Purnima.
 
 While narrating his daughter’s journey, Anand said, “Credit goes to my niece Anita Rajput. Despite being blind, she completed her B.Ed. Purnima was highly influenced and she was also keen to make her name like that.”
 
 During the talent hunt she was selected for MP’s boxing academy under the guidance of coach Roshan Lal. “I was impressed from her since her days in the summer camp . I had never seen a budding boxer hitting such strong punches. She is a borne talent. Only need was to brush up her skills,” said coach Roshan.
 
 After joining the sports academy, in 2010, Purnima won her first bronze medal in senior national in 2013.
 
 About Tuesday’s fight, Purnima said, “I am all prepared to fight against Russian. She is more experienced and a big name in the boxing circuit. But, I am least bothered about it. I am not going to let her defeat me in front of home crowd.”
