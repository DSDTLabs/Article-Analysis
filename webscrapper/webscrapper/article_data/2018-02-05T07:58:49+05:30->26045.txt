 Akhilesh has adopted a balanced approach on the  , even seeking Rs 50-lakh compensation for Chandan Gupta, the youth killed in the riots, but Ram Gopal created a controversy by claiming that the Chandan’s death in Kasganj communal riots was a mystery. He also claimed that Muslims being targeted by police and victimized.
 
 This provided an opportunity to SP’s opponents , mainly the BJP, to charge it with pandering to Muslim appeasement only and ignoring the interests of Hindus. While the opponents have always accused SP of protecting even the antisocial elements in the minority community, the fresh charges that Ram Gopal’s comment has invited has rattled the cadre. Many in the party feel that it was a deliberate design from insiders to ruin the prospects of the party in the 2019 general elections.
 
 Ram Gopal’s remarks are intriguing as Akhilesh has of late refrained from making any comment that projects the pro-minorities image of the party.
