The jury members of the ninth edition of the   gathered at a suburban hotel on Tuesday, to select the best from the world of Hindi film music. Heading the 19-member jury was veteran lyricist and scriptwriter  , who was quick to point out that songs were judged under three specific parameters. “The quality of the composition, the rendering and the lyrics are of utmost importance. Songs that have stood the test of time have always boasted of good lyrics,” he said.

  The jury, which comprises Pritam, Lalit Pandit,  ,   and Sameer to name a few, saw a new face this year. Actor, composer and singer   is the youngest member to join veterans and stalwarts of the music industry in zeroing in on this year’s winners. He said, “I asked them why they were choosing me as a jury member. And they said that there was nobody from the younger generation in the jury. Some of the veterans don’t know the new songs. But I know all the songs because I listen to everything. So I think I was of help.” The 9th Royal Stag Mirchi Music Awards will be held in Mumbai on February 18.
