This is the first time that I am seeing an actor being called by his character’s name before the movie has released. This is all new to me,” says director  , when we ask him for his reaction to the popularity of his film,  . The character in question is that of actor  , who told us that wherever he now goes, people call him  .
Speaking about Dhananjaya, it was Suri who made the actor cut off his signature locks — and the result seems to be quite a hit with the ladies. In fact, the entire look of the film and all its characters has struck the right chord with audiences. And it was Suri who thought of all these nuances. “I am a very observant person. When I make a film, I try to keep things as close to reality as possible, and this includes everything from the character’s clothes, accessories, chappals, mobile phone to the way they speak. When it came to each character’s look, my cameraman and I even discussed the colours of their clothes. It was a team effort and not something we left to the costume designer. Now, tell me, would three people buy clothes from the same shop? That’s unrealistic. We were also working with a certain colour pallet in mind and we fit in all the elements accordingly,” says Suri, matter-of-factly. Doing that for each character for all the scenes sounds like a lot of work. So, how long did all the planning take? “Once you have clarity of thought, everything falls in place. I don’t believe anyone who says that they spent six months thinking of what black shirt a character should wear. Once you are sure about the look, just ask for three black shirts and take your pick,” he says, laughing.
 As for the ‘Tagaru craze’, Suri says, “I never knew that the popularity of the film would be at such a level. I didn’t ever think about   while filming Tagaru; to me, it was just about putting in good work. This is my ninth film and the aim for all my films is that ultimately, the movie has to be good. I don’t think about anything else.”
