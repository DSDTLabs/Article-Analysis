CHANDIGARH: The   (CAG) has taken serious note of the situation where it found that as many as 788 primary schools (8.86%) and 269 upper primary schools (4.79%) in Haryana were running   in the academic year 2015-16.

 The situation has been highlighted by the CAG in its audit of the implementation of the right to free and compulsory education (RTE) Act, 2009, in Haryana from April 2010 to March 2016. The audit report says, “Persistent vacancies and lack of proper deployment of available teachers cause adverse pupil teacher ratio (PTR). Adverse PTR and single teacher schools affects the quality of education being imparted and the learning environment.” As per the union ministry of human resource development, PTR at primary level should be 30:1, at the upper primary level 35:1 and at secondary level should be 30:1.
 
 The audit also found that as per state’s own data, as many as 96,120 were “out of school children” in 2014-15 and in 2015-16, the figure rose to 1.95 lakh students. It came out during the audit that the net enrollment ratio in academic year 2015-16 was 73.76% in primary classes, 69.36% in upper primary classes and 50.65% in secondary classes in Haryana.
 
 The CAG has commented, “Access to elementary education is not a privilege, it’s a legally enforceable right and yet, many of the children are still not in school. The number of children eligible for elementary education is not being maintained and updated through household surveys by the local authorities under the appropriate government.”
 
 Highlighting the huge unutilised budget for implementation of the  , the CAG commented that Haryana government had unspent balance of Rs 305.52 crore in 2015-16. “Retention of huge balances by the state government, year after year at the close of each financial year was indicative of poor internal control by the authorities concerned in the state/ centre,” reads the CAG report.
 
 The CAG has also found that there was no internal audit system in place in the directorate of elementary education (DEE) and Haryana school shiksha pariyojna parishad (HSSPP). 
 
 “An amount of Rs 2,147.14 crore was released by director, elementary education (DEE) to HSSPP during 2009-15, but verification of annual accounts prepared/ maintained by the Parishad revealed that only Rs 2,027.36 crore was accounted for and balance of Rs 109.78 crore was not accounted for in accounts.”
 
 The CAG has also mentioned in its report that though the state commission of protection of child rights (SCPCR) should have been constituted in all states by April 2010 but Haryana constituted the SCPCR in December 2012.
