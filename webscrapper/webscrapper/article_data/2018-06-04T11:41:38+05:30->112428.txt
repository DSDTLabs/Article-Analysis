AHMEDABAD: Many local residents and shop owners of   gathered around the 70-year-old neighbourhood Banyan tree when   ( ) officials arrived to prune it to ready the site for ‘bhoomipujan’ or ground-breaking ceremony. 

 
  Trouble began when a   reached the site to dig a pit for havan. “We thought the AMC had come to uproot the tree as the tree is located on the roadline below the Vastrapur flyover,” said Jugal Bhatt, one of the residents. When a few labourers began chopping the branches, the locals asked the labourers to leave and sat on a protest. At least two similar protests were witnessed in March this year when the AMC’s roads and building department came to uproot the tree. 
 
  resident Satish Panchal told TOI, “Even to this day one sees a healthy parrot population, along with that of other birds, bats, and numerous insects on the tree.” He went on to say: “We are emotionally attached to this tree and we will not allow it to be cut.” The AMC’s new west zone officials said that they have no plans to cut the tree. “We just pruned a few branches to clear the site for the havan ceremony, but residents got suspicious,” an AMC official said.
