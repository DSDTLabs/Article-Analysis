NEW DELHI: Nine-year-old Noor Jamal picks up a white plastic sack and leaves his home before sunrise, along with his brother, every day. Instead of heading towards school, the two make rounds of the lanes and dhalaos of Goyla Khurd village in search of recyclable waste. 

 Jamal is one of the 150 kids, who have become   to support their families. Mostly migrants from Assam and West Bengal, they settled in Shyam Kunj in Chhawla four-five years ago. 
 
 Like Saidul (12), Safikul (8) and Lal Chand (7) who died, allegedly due suffocation after inhaling poisonous fumes inside a drain, scores of children get exposed to such an hazardous environment on a day-to-day basis. And they   their   just to earn Rs 20-30 a day. 
 
 “I also want to go to school, but who will do the work then,” asked Jamal. “We roam around till 4 in the evening and deposit the scrap to the contractor. Money goes to our parents,” he added.
 
 Besides the unbearable stench they brave on a daily basis, the kids have to protect themselves from stray dogs and bullocks while going out in search of scraps. Some of them have even fallen prey to substance abuse, locals allege. The families have taken small plots on rent, which they use to separate the different kinds of waste—pet bottles, plastic bags, metals and glass bottles. 
 
 Rajeev Jakhad, who lives opposite the “accident site”, said, “Just yesterday, some people had pulled out a few kids from the same drain. There used to be a fence around this place, but someone had stolen it and sold it as scrap. The families should be held responsible for such mishaps. None of these kids, who are visible across the village, goes to school.”
 
 Mahesh Kumar, the contractor who used to buy scraps from the victim family, said, “It is an accident. There is no foul play; no one has pushed them inside.”
