BENGALURU: In a highly secure, clean room of the   ( ) here, a new jugalbandi is unfolding — teams from the private sector are working shoulder-to-shoulder with government engineers to create a new bird that will soar in the sky very soon.

 The Indian space establishment has crossed a new threshold, engaging for the first time a private sector industry to make a full multicrore, heavy duty satellite. Having been unable to keep pace with satellite fabrication, the Isro has now roped in the private industry to bridge the gap.
 
 A consortium led by   Design Technologies, Bengaluru is tasked to make two full satellites for India’s navigation system. After almost 150 missions and three decades of space faring, the Isro is on a mission like never before, handholding the private industry to make a full navigation satellite. Towards that, a high-tech defence equipment supplier from Bengaluru,   has been chosen as the first private industry tasked with making not one but two full satellites for the ISRO.
 
 Colonel H S Shankar, the man who helped India get its first bulk supply of electronic voting machines (EVMs), is leading the consortium. Shankar, Chairman-cum-Manging Director of Alpha Design Technologies, says, “It is a challenging task for any Indian company to undertake assembly, integration and testing of a satellite and that too for the first time in India.”
