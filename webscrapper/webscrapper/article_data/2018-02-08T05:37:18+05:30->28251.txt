NEW DELHI: The   ministry has approved increasing the speed limit of cars plying on   from the existing 80 kmph to 100 kmph. On expressways, the maximum permissible limit for cars will be 120 kmph. 

 Sources said road transport minister   approved the maximum speed limits on Wednesday and a notification will be out soon. The minister has also reportedly approved putting in a device like electronic control unit, which will not allow vehicles to go at very high speeds. 
 
 The idea is to end the installation of external devices like speed governors considering that there have been several complaints about monopoly of a few players, a source said. "Technology can solve that problem of speeding," the source added.
 
 As per the decision,   will be allowed to ply at a maximum speed of 80 kmph on highways and expressways; 90 kmph for trucks and buses on expressway and 80 kmph on national highways.The state and local authorities including the traffic police will decide the speed limit for state and local roads, which will be much less than the limit set for national highways.
 
 Union government revises speed limit from time to time as the road infrastructure improves. 
 
 While increasing the speed limit may be just an official procedure, highway users say people often drive at more than 120-130 kmph and there is hardly any enforcement of speeding on NHs.
