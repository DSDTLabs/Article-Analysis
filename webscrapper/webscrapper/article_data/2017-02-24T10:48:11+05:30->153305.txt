VADODARA: A resident of Wadi was booked for making a fake identity card of   and visiting card of a city-based lawyer. Co-incidentally the accused was former client of the lawyer.

 Nilkesh Desai, a resident of Wadi, was arrested for three cases of cheating in 2014 and 2015 for which advocate   had bailed him out. During the proceedings, Raval had given his visiting card to Desai. Earlier last year, Raval learnt that Desai had faked the former’s identity card of Bar Council of Gujarat.
 
 Raval gave an application at Raopura police station to file a case of cheating against Desai. During his statement at Raopura police station, Desai refused the charges. But, his wife told the police that he had showed his identity as a lawyer after which they got married. She also told the police that in connection with a case, the Madhya Pradesh police had seized Desai’s car in which the police had found legal documents of several persons, blank cheques and fake identity card of the Bar Council.
 
 When the police did not file the case against Desai, Raval filed the application in the court after which the court directed Raopura police to take Raval’s complaint.
 
 Raval said that the several cases of cheating that were registered against Desai were also about impersonating as assistant of senior lawyers and legal adviser of State Bank of India. The police is yet to arrest Desai as he is absconding.
