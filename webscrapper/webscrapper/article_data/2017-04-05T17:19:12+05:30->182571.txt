In a matter of days, director   will launch the first trailer of his upcoming film ‘Half Girlfriend’ starring 
  and 
 . However, as fans eagerly await the trailer launch, the makers unveiled a surprise teaser clip featuring their leading man Arjun, as his Bihari character Madhav Jha.
 
 The clip sees Arjun, well immersed in his character, reading out his character Madhav’s description of his love interest Riya Somani (Shraddha). It ends with the star asking the question, “Yeh   hota kya hain? (What does Half Girlfriend even mean?)”
 
  
  
 
 The romantic comedy, which is an adaptation of Chetan Bhagat’s novel by the same name, explores the complicated relationship between Madhav and Riya. It can probably be aptly summed up by the film’s tagline which reads, “Dost se zyada, girlfriend se kum” (More than a friend, less than a girlfriend). 
  
 For those impressed with the actor’s Bihari accent, all credit goes to him for going the extra mile (literally) and living in Bihar for 10-odd days to pick up the authentic accent before filming and dubbing began. It had been reported that Arjun hired a language coach and even interacted with the locals to learn their dialect and mannerisms.
  
 ‘Half Girlfriend’ will see Arjun and Shraddha paired up for the first time on screen. The movie revolves around Madhav and Riya’s close friendship that blossoms over their love for basketball.
 
 The film is slated for release on May 19, 2017.
