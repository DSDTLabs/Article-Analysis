NAGPUR: The troubles for   from   are far from over as yet another case was filed against him challenging caste   committee’s clean chit to him.

 On Monday, the division bench of the high court issued notices to state social welfare department secretary, State Election Commission (SEC), Buldhana collector and the MLA asking them to reply within two weeks.
 
 Petitioner Sahebrao Sardar, through counsel Pradeep Wathore, contended that in 2009 Raimulkar contested assembly elections from a seat reserved for scheduled castes. He also submitted that the MLA claimed he belonged to ‘Sutar Balai’ caste of which no verification was done and later he completed his five-year tenure without submission of any caste validity certificate. The petitioner pointed out that there exists no caste called as ‘Sutar Balai’ and the MLA’s real brother has been identified by the divisional caste   scrutiny committee in Akola as belonging to OBC category.
 
 Sardar and other complainants had on October 1, 2009 filed a complaint before the scrutiny committee in Akola stating that the MLA didn’t belong to SC category. In reality, he is from Sutar caste which has been recognized as OBC, following which on January 19, 2016, the committee had invalidated his caste claim.
