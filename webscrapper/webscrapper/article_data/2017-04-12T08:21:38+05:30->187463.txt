RANCHI: As many as 11 underage drivers, mostly school students, were penalised on Tuesday by the   for not wearing helmets while riding bikes during a four-hour long checking drive carried across multiple locations in the city. 

 Despite the  's initiative to   and   to adhere to   a few months ago, the efforts seem to have been futile as was evident during the drive. 
 
 "We collected a total fine of Rs 11,000 from the parents of those children who were caught riding without helmets. A few other violators were penalised for not carrying licence and registration papers," traffic (DSP) Dilip Khalkho said.
 
 Khalkho said the vehicles of the traffic violators were seized. "Apart from this, triple riders and a few others driving without number plates and insurance papers were also penalised. Approximately, Rs 50,000 was collected as fine from the violators," he added.
 
 Khalkho also announced crackdown on drunk drivers. "We are going to tighten the noose around drunk drivers. The department has purchased 40 breathalysers for this," he said. 
 
 The drive by the traffic department comes two days after three youths, riding without helmets, were killed in a n accident on Airport Road on Sunday. 
 
 Traffic SP Sanjay Ranjan Singh, led the drive, said, "Traffic violators are mostly school students who are underage and not fit to ride bikes. We have begun distributing helmets free-of-cost to colleges and our target is to distribute 21,000 helmets by the end of the year. But, it is the responsibility of parents to prevent children from unsafe driving."
