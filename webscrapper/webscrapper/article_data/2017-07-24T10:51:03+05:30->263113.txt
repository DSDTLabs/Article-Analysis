PUNE: A sessions court has convicted and sentenced a 26-year-old man to life imprisonment for killing his wife by setting her ablaze near Tilak statue in Mandai on the night of December 17, 2013. 

 Additional sessions judge M R Purwar found the accused,  , guilty of an offence punishable under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5,000. Jogdand, who has been in jail ever since his arrest on December 25, 2013, will get the benefit of set off for the period so far served in jail, the court ruled. 
 
 The court held that the case did not fall within the definition of the rarest of rare case to merit a  . However, the normal punishment for murder is life imprisonment along with a reasonable fine. 
 
 The victim, Radha Shankar Jogdand’s, dying declaration while she was being taken to the   and her statement recorded by a police head constable in the presence of a medical officer proved critical in convicting the accused. Additional public prosecutor N D Patil examined 10 witnesses. 
 
 The judge referred to the evidence on record including deposition by the witnesses, medical evidence and police investigation papers and held that Radha’s dying declaration was voluntary, true and inspired full confidence in terms of accepting the same. 
 
 “It is settled proposition of law that the dying declaration can be sole basis of conviction if it inspires confidence of the court,” the judge observed. “Further there is corroboration to the dying declaration,” the court held. 
 
 “There is no positive defence of the accused that death of Radha is accidental or suicidal,” the court observed. It said that the presence of the accused was established. 
 
 There was nothing on record to show that accused ever tried to extinguish the fire on his wife. The prosecution has proved its case beyond doubt, the court ruled.
