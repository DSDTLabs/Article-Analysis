BENGALURU: The Supreme Court’s directive to implement its February 9, 2017 order to revise the promotion list of government employees within a month has come as a setback for the  

 The government has been dragging its feet on the sensitive issue for about a year because of the approaching assembly polls.
 
 
 In January, the SC had slammed the government for not complying with its February 9 directive and had set a deadline of March.
 
 
 
 The state’s plea for a sixmonth extension was rejected on Tuesday by a bench headed by   who gave April 25 deadline to implement the order after senior advocate  , on behalf of the state, submitted the revised seniority list of departments.
 
 “If the directives are not complied with, then the chief secretary has to appear before the court on April 25,”Justice Goel said.
 
 This would mean that when the seniority lists are published and implemented by various departments in a month, about 10,000 SC/ST officials would face demotion, as promotions of general-category employees are effected. This leaves the government in a tricky position as it cannot afford to   closer to the polls. “We need to find a way to defer the implementation by a couple of months,’’ a minister said.
 
 On February 9, the court had held that the exercise for determining inadequacy of representation, backwardness, and overall efficiency is a must before a state decides to provide reservation with consequential seniority under Article 16 (4A) of the Constitution for SC/ST persons in government service. It had then given Karnataka three months to revise its list.
