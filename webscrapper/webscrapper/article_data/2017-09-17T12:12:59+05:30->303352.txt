PUNE: The total rainfall received in the city has crossed the 600mm-mark, a surplus of 122mm, despite a subdued monsoon activity in early September.

 “Good rainfall expected in the next few days taking this figure up further,”   (IMD) officials said on Saturday.
 
 Though Pune’s normal rainfall till this time of the monsoon season is 484.4mm, the city’s rain quantum has touched a significant 606.1mm. With this, the city has received 122.2mm surplus rainfall from June till September 16.
 
 “The recent thundershowers in the city have added to the existing above-normal quota of rainfall. The rainfall this monsoon season has not only been good for Pune, but also for some other cities in state, including Aurangabad, Nashik, Jalgaon and Akola, among others,” an IMD official said.
 
 Though the city’s September quota of rain is 122.3mm, the recent thundershowers brought 41.9mm rainfall to the city. However, with another 14 days till September-end, Pune is likely to meet its September quota of rains too, especially because showers are expected to continue throughout the next week.
 
 The convective activity will be promoted by the cyclonic circulation over central India and another over the  . The Met department has forecast widespread rainfall for central Maharashtra and Konkan-Goa for the next few days, while fairly widespread showers have been projected for Marathwada. “Fairly widespread rainfall may occur in Vidarbha on September 19 and 20,” the department said.
 
 Meanwhile, 0.4mm rainfall was recorded at IMD’s Shivajinagar weather observatory with its Lohegaon observatory receiving none.
 
 Instances of traffic jam and uprooted trees were reported from several areas of the city. An IMD official said other areas may have received more rainfall than 0.4mm, but the Shivajinagar weather observatory only depicted the rain in Shivajinagar area.
