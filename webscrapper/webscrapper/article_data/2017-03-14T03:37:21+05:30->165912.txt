MUMBAI: The   and   have decided to raise the issue of stringent rules framed by the   government to regulate app-based cabs in the legislative council.

 Leader of opposition in legislative council, Dhananjay Munde, said Mumbaikars should not suffer because of these new rules framed to regulate app-based operators. 
 
 Congress too had decided to second the issue. Senior Congress MLC Anant Gadgil told TOI that the rules should be for consumer’s safety and not to protect someone else’s “kaali-peeli” business. Gadgil said that instead of putting restrictions on   and  , government should keep an eye on illegal passengers service by private vehicles on Mumbai-Pune route. 
 
 A Congress MLA, requesting anonymity, pointed out that the Shiv Sena has its own taxi union that is allegedly forcing the party to protect its business. It should be noted that the public transport portfolio is with the Sena and headed by Diwakar Raote. 
 
 The state government issued two notifications on October 15, 2016 and on March 4, 2017 to set stringent rules for app-based aggregators.
 
 The permit fee applicable for app-based cabs having engine capacity less than 1400 CC has been fixed at Rs 25,000, and for 1400CC and more it is Rs 2.61 lakh. No such fees has been levied on kaali-peeli taxis. 
 
 A source from a   aggregator company said that if pushed to the wall, they may move the high court. “We want driver partners to continue having a stable income while providing reliable service to Mumbaikars,” the source added.
