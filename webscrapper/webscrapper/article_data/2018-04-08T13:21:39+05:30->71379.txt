VADODARA:   (CM) Nitin   took officials of the state-run   Hospital to task during his surprise visit to the hospital on Saturday afternoon. 

 The deputy CM, who was in Vadodara to begin the 8th edition of Gunotsav – for evaluating education in primary schools, had paid a surprise visit to the hospital. 
 
 Patel, who took a round of the emergency ward and the OPD sections, pulled up a contractor for not maintaining the required hygiene in the washrooms at the hospital. 
 
 When the deputy CM was leaving the hospital premises, a female relative of a patient who had passed away recently complained that the patient had died because of negligence of the hospital authorities. 
 
 Trying hard to control her tears, Kirti Sharma complained that her brother Chetan Damodar Sharma, was last month admitted after he received a head injury. 
 
 The woman complained that her brother passed away as neurosurgeon did not reach on time and proper oxygen was also not available when the patient was admitted at SSG Hospital. 
 
 As the female relative insisted that the authorities do something about the sad state of affairs at the hospital, the deputy CM asked SSG’s medical superintendent R N Daveshwar to inquire into the complaint and submit a report within an hour. 
 
 Later talking to media persons about his visit, Patel said he will continue paying such surprise visits to nearby hospitals during his tours to check whether proper medical facilities are available to patients at government hospitals. 
 
 “I visited the hospital to know whether patients are getting proper treatment, medicines are easily available to them and the staff is maintaining proper hygiene,” he said.
