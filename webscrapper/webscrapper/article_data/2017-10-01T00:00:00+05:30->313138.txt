He is a person of wisdom from whom the new generation must learn,” says Vineetha Jayaraj, a bank employee from Jagathy.
 
  Yesudas explained the meaning of the Gayathri mantra in simple Malayalam and gave the children some dos and don’ts. “We should not be selfish in life and should help others through our words and actions.

It is only to make your life better. Be like the trees which selflessly give us shade and oxygen, ” he said.
