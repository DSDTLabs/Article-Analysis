 is very common in this current era with the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( ) estimating that 9.1% of US Adults meet the criteria for depression including 4.1% who meet the criteria for major depression. Psychological factors such as depression, chronic stress and anxiety; chronic hostility and anger; social isolation and perceived lack of social support have consistently been linked with the risk of coronary heart disease. 

 Depression is consistently associated with the development of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients without Cardiovascular Disease. 
 Similarly patients with known Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) have higher prevalence of depression. Depression almost doubles the risk of developing CHD. Approximately 20% of patients hospitalised for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) have major depressive disorder on admission or within a few weeks thereafter. Among these patients the mortality rate is approximately 2.5 times that in patients without depression. Major depression and elevated depressive symptoms are associated with worse prognosis in patients with CHD. Severe depression can be correlated with more severe cardiac events. Depression appears to remain associated with at least a doubling in the risk of cardiac events over 1 to 2 years after Myocardial Infarction (MI).
 
 Effective treatment options for depression include antidepressants, Cognitive behavioural therapy and physical activity. Medicines are helpful for many; but usually not for stress. Some people take tranquilizers to calm them down immediately, but it's far better in the long term to learn and manage your stress through relaxation or stress management techniques. If you suffer from anxiety, speak with your doctor about treatment or management. Exercise, maintain a positive attitude, stop smoking, cut down drinking, enjoy a healthy diet and maintain a healthy weight to deal with stress.
