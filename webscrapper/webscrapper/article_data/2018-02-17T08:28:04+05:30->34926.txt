HYDERABAD: Cocking a snook at the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ) officials who have been looking for him in the disproportionate assets ( ) case and even got a lookout circular issued, accused Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) director K Purushottam Reddy surrendered before the court on Friday.

 On February 2, ACB sleuths raided the houses and office of director (planning) of HMDA and unearthed disproportionate assets worth Rs 25 crore.
 
 At around 10.15am on Friday, Purushottam Reddy surrendered before the ACB Special Court in the DPA case. He was sent to judicial remand by the court till March1.

Majority ofthe gold belongs to Nivedita Reddy but we have found two diamond necklaces weighing about 35 to 40 tolas, which Purushottam Reddy’s daughter   wore on her wedding. The two necklaces are worth Rs1crore,” ACB inspector   said.
