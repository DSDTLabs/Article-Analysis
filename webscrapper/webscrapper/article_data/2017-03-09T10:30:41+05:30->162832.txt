 is on an overdrive promoting her upcoming film ‘Phillauri’. At a recent media interaction in Mumbai, the lady did something incredibly cool. She picked up a reporter's phone to answer a call. Why you ask? Well, because,   was calling, and no one misses a call from their mother. 

 So on Tuesday afternoon while the actress was answering questions tossed at her, she happened to see a ringing cell phone in the pool of media recorders and boom mikes. Without batting an eyelid, the lady reached straight for the phone that read 'Mumma calling' and spontaneously answered the call. 
 
 "Hi aunty, she (your daughter) is in an interview right now, she will call you later. I am Anushka." She then went on to ask the reporter's name and responded, "Aunty she will call you later. She's taking my interview." Everyone, including Anushka’s ‘Phillauri’ co-star Diljit, were left in splits. 
 
  
  
 
 Anushka is known for speaking her mind and being her bindaas self, which her fans absolutely love. The actress, who plays a ghost in her home production, is making all the right noise ahead of its release on March 24.
