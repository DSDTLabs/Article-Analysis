NAGPUR: Acting swiftly on a tipoff, the   police chased a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( ) bus and nabbed four women thieves, including mastermind, travelling in the bus near Butibori stop on Thursday. 

 No stolen valuables could be recovered from the thieves as they had probably handed it over to other gang members before boarding the bus, said police. 
 
 The accused have been identified as mastermind   (40), Tanuja Katagde (40), Komal Lokhande alias Soni (25) and   alias Manju (40), all hailing from Saoner. Their accomplices are yet to be identified, said cops.
 
 Cops were already on the lookout of these women in previous cases. Around 12 noon on Thursday, beat marshal commandos got a call from a bus controller Kawdu Maske, 53, who spotted the gang at Sneh Nagar bus stop near Chhattrapati Square on Wardha Road.
 
 Maske told cops that the gang had surrounded a woman passenger while she was boarding a bus. One of them blocked the woman’s way and started asking frivolous questions to the conductor, thus distracting the woman passenger. 
 
 Maske spotted the mastermind unzip the passenger’s bag before she stepped into the bus. The gang then took another bus headed to Wardha, Maske told cops.
 
 The commandos, who along with women cops, intercepted the Wardha-bound bus at Butibori and caught hold of the women. 
 
 Cops said the gang was identified due to their big bindis, scarves, saris and gaudy appearance. The thieves operated at other busy bus stops too. 
 
 “The miscreants would hand over the stolen material to their aides and travel in another bus,” said senior PI   and added previous offences have been registered against them at Dhantoli and Sitabuldi police stations.
 
 Cops produced the accused in the court and demanded custody remand for investigation. One of them is mother of an infant. The court released them after levying a fine of Rs3,000 each.
