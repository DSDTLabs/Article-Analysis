I am a morning person. Years of having to wake up early for school, work and kids have primed me for that. Sleep is a luxury, so I have honed my skills over the years in designing really good sleep – a quiet room with warm lights (TV and computers are a no-no), firm bed, high pillow and my favourite negative-ion beddings — all lull me to a well-deserved rest. I turn off my devices by 11 pm, spend time meditating before lights out.

 I love waking up knowing that an emotional reset has happened overnight during my sleep, and get up knowing that I have a   template to play with for the day. Starting the morning well, i.e. gently and slowly, sets the tone for the rest of the day. The first thing I do is lie still and try to recall my dreams. Then I get into a full body stretch, and gently get my blood pumping through my limbs by rotating my feet and hands.
 
 I have a tall glass of warm water with lemon juice and then, either meditate, journal or listen to an inspirational music. I resist the urge to turn on any communication device to delay the more mundane. I love to stay in my blissful state for as long as I can before taking a deep breath, saying, “Bring it on!”
