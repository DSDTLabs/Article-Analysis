NASHIK: The Central Railway on Wednesday started the repair and renovation work of track and level crossing No. 99 on   route near Niphad railway station, causing inconvenience to commuters. The gate has been closed for five days until Monday.

 As this road is the important route joining Gujarat to Shirdi, devotees — who came to Shirdi on the occasion of first Thursday of the New Year — had to face difficulties.
 
 “We had to take an alternate road from   crossing. It added 12 km to our trip. Moreover, the condition of the road was pathetic,” said Aniket Bhavik, who came to Shirdi from Surat.
 
 Not only tourists, but daily commuters are also facing difficulties as the only road joining Niphad and Pimpalgaon villages is completely shut. Local residents blamed railway administration for not providing prior information about the repair work. “Neither MSRTC Bus, nor private four-wheeler is available to commute between Niphad and Pimpalgaon. Buses of Pimpalgaon Depot are coming only up to   from where we are forced to walk for 5 km to reach Niphad,” said student Vikram Pagare.
 
 Meanwhile, the traffic moving towards Shirdi, Niphad and Aurangabad via Pimpalgaon was diverted towards Nanduri Road that increases the journey by 18 km.
 
 The railway authorities said they had issued a notice and suggested alternate route for the commuters. “Railways never conduct repair works without prior notice. Kundewadi gram panchayat authorities, police station of Niphad and MSRTC were informed in advance and they adopted the alternative routes. Police are also handling traffic arrangements on the alternative routes,” said a senior official at Niphad railway station.
 
 According to authorities, the gate will remain closed from 8 am to 6 pm till Monday.
