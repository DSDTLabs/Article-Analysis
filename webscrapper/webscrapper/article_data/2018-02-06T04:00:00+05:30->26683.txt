Rajkot: Four flamingoes were electrocuted when they came into contact with a high-tension line at Bamansar village of Rapar taluka in Kutch district on Sunday evening. 

 “We have recovered charred bodies of the birds and sent them for postmortem. The high-tension line has become cause for deaths of many birds,” said range forest officer Lalubha Jadeja. 
 
 “In 2013, at Khadir village, some 12km from Adesar village in Rapar taluka, 130 flamingoes had been electrocuted after coming into contact with a high-tension line,” said Jadeja. 
 
 Acting on the complaint from the forest department, state government had removed the high-tension line at Khadir village and buried it underground. However, the high-tension line at Bamansar village remains there, posing danger to lives of migratory birds like flamingoes, ducks and pelicans.
