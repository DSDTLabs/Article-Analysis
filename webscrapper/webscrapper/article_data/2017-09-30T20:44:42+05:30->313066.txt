 MUMBAI: In a curious turn of events, the political wing of the newly-formed PCMC overturned its decision in 24 hours and decided to take over the collection and transportation of garbage from Cidco nodes from January 1, 2018. 

 Cidco sources said, "senior officers were in touch with Panvel mayor and politicos over the phone."
 
 Cidco chief health officer, B S Bawaskar confirmed having got the letter Friday evening. But, mayor,   allayed fears of the corporation succumbing to Cidco as she had shot off a letter Thursday refusing to take charge of trash collection and its transportation. 
 
 "We will take over the work only after we sign the agreement that will include a thorough joint survey of the works to be completed by Cidco as in infra works related to road, garden water and other issues. We can always defer the taking over of garbage work."
 
 Pritam Mhatre, leader of the opposition PWP in the   dominated civic house said, "four of our members in the 12-member committee had opposed the move." Sources said the "decision of the all-party commiittee had to be communicated to the civic commissioner and discussed at the general body before taking a decision, but the mayor did not abide by the norms."
 
  of Swacch Kharghar manch criticised the "sudden change in decision." She said, "as per the minutes of the meeting held by the manch on September 15 in which Cidco MD, Panvel commissioner and Panvel MLA participated, the Panvel corporation general body had to take a decision. This has been violated." 
 
 PCMC commissioner,   said, "Cidco has to complete various infra works in the nodes. Ours is a new civic body just one year old and I hope, the corporation does not face problems."
 
 Cidco had insisted that PCMC take over the nodal civic administration from October 1. PCMC was constituted last year on October 1.
