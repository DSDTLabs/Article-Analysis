MUMBAI: The city economic offences wing ( ) may soon get custody of a cheat who fled the country in 2006 and was located by Singapore police recently, in its first case of getting a red corner notice (RCN) successful. 

  alias Captain, now 59, had   28 Indian job-seekers in Singapore 11 years ago. “Captain said he would send people to work on a ship in Singapore and collected over Rs 28.70 lakh but he never got   for them,” said a city EOW officer. “When we learnt he was in Singapore, a red corner notice was issued against him through the Central Bureau of Investigation. Recently, Singapore police located him and took him into custody. An EOW team has left to submit extradition documents and evidence against Captain before a Singapore court,” said a source. 
 
 Captain used to meet up people and ask them if they were interested in going abroad for jobs. In 2006, he met several youths who were interested. They brought some friends and relatives who were also keen. “He collected money from them and took them to Bengaluru, where they underwent training in fire safety and security. Those aspiring to work as stewards got certificates after completing courses, besides a certificate required to work abroad,” added a source.
 
 Captain later collected everyone’s passports and got visas for them. The aspirants were told to bear their flight and hotel expenses in Singapore. “They were happy on reaching Singapore, and hoped to get jobs assured by Captain. But a month passed and they were not hired by any shipping firm or hotel. Their tourist visas also expired. Captain told them to contact the   in Singapore, which later sent them to India as their visas had expired,” said the source.
 
 On reaching India, the job-seekers tried to contact Captain several times and asked about their jobs or getting their money back. Later, they approached EOW and a case was filed. Police said they had recorded statements of victims and evidence, and he will be prosecuted once extradited.
