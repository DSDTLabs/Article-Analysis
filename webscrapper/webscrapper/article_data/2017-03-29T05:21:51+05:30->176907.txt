MUMBAI: Students from Cambridge International Examination (CIE)-affiliated schools from this year can get provisional admission to FYJC on the basis of predictive class X marks.

 Students who appeared for the IGCSE (class X equivalent) exams in May would until now miss out on their chance to apply to FYJC through the online admission as they would not have received their marksheets by then.
 
 However, this year on the office of the deputy director of education is incorporating a change in the online system as prescribed by the state. The state education department on July 25, 2016, had issued a government resolution which stated that IGCSE students can seek provisional admission to FYJC. The GR also stated that the admission would be confirmed after the submission of the marksheet.
