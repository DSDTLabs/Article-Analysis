VADODARA: If you witness an accident in the city and see an auto driver giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the victim, don’t be surprised. For, hundreds of auto drivers across the city are being trained to save lives of the accident victims. The traffic police have undertaken a drive to train the auto-drivers and cops for giving medical attention to the accident victims till the emergency services arrive. 

 “Auto drivers are present on the city roads round the clock. Whenever any accident happens, the chances of an auto driver passing by are always high. So we decided to train them in giving CPR and other basic medical attention. The idea is to save lives in those first few precious minutes after the accident,” said Amita  , ACP (Traffic).
 
 “Nearly 800 auto-drivers registered under our ‘Nirbhay Savaari’ scheme will be trained at the GMERS Medical College, Gotri, from Wednesday. They will be trained in two different batches,” Vanani told TOI. Under the ‘Nirbhay Savari’, the auto drivers, who are registered with the police, have been given special three digit numbers that are displayed in bold letters on their vehicles.
 
 These auto drivers will be taught CPR in theory and practical by the experts from Lifeline Foundation. Apart from giving CPR (medical technique for reviving heart if it stops beating), the auto drivers will also be trained in checking pulse and giving first aid for injuries caused to road accidents.
 
 “We are also training 200 traffic cops, 200 policemen from different police stations and 100 from city police HQ in giving CPR. They are being trained in two different batches daily. After the training that ends on Thursday, we will be giving certificates to both auto drivers and the cops who underwent the training,” Vanani said. They will then be eligible to give CPR at any occasion in case of emergencies.
