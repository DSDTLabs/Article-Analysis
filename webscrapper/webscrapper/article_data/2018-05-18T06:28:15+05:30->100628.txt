CHENNAI: DMK working president M K   has accused Prime Minister   of murdering democracy by ensuring the swearing-in of a BJP government in Karnataka that did not enjoy a majority. 

 Stalin in a series of tweets condemned Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala’s action and likened it to   governor Banwarilal Purohit “permitting a minority government here”. 
 
 “Tamil Nadu has a minority government, and the country knows that the Prime Minister has ensured a minority government in Karnataka as well (with   assuming charge as chief minister on Thursday). It is against the Constitution and the DMK condemns the continuous murder of democracy in the country,” Stalin told reporters on Thursday. 
 
 He alleged that governors of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and several other states were working at the behest of the Centre. Earlier, Stalin took to social media to criticise the Karnataka governor. “The Karnataka governor’s hasty invitation to the BJP to form a government despite majority of the MLAs forming a post-poll alliance is arbitrary and unconstitutional. Such a move will lead to horse-trading. It will destroy our democratic foundations (sic),” tweeted Stalin. “AIADMK government which also incidentally does not enjoy the majority support in the legislative assembly. Constitutional institutions and principles are under threat from these actions (sic),” said Stalin in another tweet.
 
 Tamil Nadu Congress chief S Thirunavukkarasar also criticised the Prime Minister for using all state governors to BJP’s advantage. “Since 2014, the Prime Minister has appointed all RSS members as governor and through them he is managing the states,” said Thirunavukkarasar. The TN Congress has announced that its workers will protest against the Karnataka governor’s action across the state. MDMK chief Vaiko, VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan and Left party leaders, too, came down heavily on   for swearing in B S Yeddyurappa as chief minister of Karnataka on Thursday.
