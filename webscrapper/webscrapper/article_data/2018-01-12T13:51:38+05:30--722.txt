LUDHIANA: The city continues to witness above normal temperatures, even as partly cloudy conditions prevailed in Ludhiana on Thursday. The good news for residents is that the Met department predicts dry weather to prevail in the next few days.

 The maximum temperature in the city was recorded at 22.9C (five degrees above normal), whereas the minimum temperature was 8.3C (three degrees above normal). Relative humidity was recorded at 79% (slightly below normal). However, visibility in the city on Thursday morning was better than the past week, as it was recorded at 750 metres.
 
 As residents continued to enjoy the pleasant weather, there is more good news coming their way. Met department officials at Chandigarh said even as partly cloudy conditions were expected in the next two days, there are no chances of rainfall. They added that fog/mist are likely in Ludhiana in the morning hours. According to the Met department website, day temperature was expected to rise in the next two days, and it might reach 23C on Saturday. However, there are chances of a fall in night temperature in the coming days, which is expected to touch 6C the same day.
 
 Residents are happy about the weather in the city. “Last week, I was planning to escape to Dubai with my family due to severe cold in the city, but I have cancelled the programme, as conditions are great in Ludhiana as well. We have even stopped using heating appliances at night, as it is not too cold. Also, during the day, the temperature is high, so I don’t wear warm stuff, but simply wear a sweatshirt,” said Mohit Jain, a businessman from Civil Lines.
