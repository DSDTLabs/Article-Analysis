HYDERABAD: After TOI reported on the  , one of the busiest stretches in the city, the road has been re-carpeted. 

 Potholes on the lane were filled and a 40mm bitumen layer was laid. After the works were completed,   ( ) officials cleared the residual construction material from the road.
  
  
 The road was refurbished using Full-Depth Recycling ( ) technology, but GHMC’s experiment failed as the road was filled with potholes. Even dust emanating from construction material became a major problem. So, after restoration works were completed on Sunday, commuters were relieved.
 
 “Apart from health hazards due to the dust, construction material scattered on the stretch was turning out to be dangerous, especially for motorists. I saw many vehicles almost skidded when they applied breaks,” said Rajneesh Shinde, a retired teacher.
 
 One of the commuters said after the bitumen layer was laid, the road has ceased to be bumpy. “Before laying the tar layer, I could feel the vibrations while passing through the stretch. Now, the ride is smooth,” said  , a student.
 
 He added that due to the potholes, earlier he felt sudden jolt in his shoulder while commuting along the stretch. GHMC officials said if no vehicles were allowed to pass through the road for a week, as the FDR technology demanded, the road would not have been damaged.
 
 “The company that laid the road wanted it to be closed for a week before laying the bitumen layer, but traffic police didn’t agree to that,” said E Nagender, executive engineer, GHMC Khairatabad circle.
 
 The road was laid by a private agency free of cost. It will be tested by  , who will assess it.
