Trichy: In an attempt to pre-empt further accidents, Pudukkottai district administration has closed the oil effluent   that went up in flames on Thursday at Nallandarkoil village. 

 The five-foot cement tank is located near the ONGC exploratory well at Nallandarkoil village near Neduvasal where the local residents are staging a protest against the hydrocarbon project. A fire broke out from the oil effluent tank outside the ONGC well late on Thursday causing panic among the villagers. Fire fighters which were called in put out the fire in an hour with the assistance of two fire tender vehicles.
 
 Following the incident, the villagers took to the road demanding closure of the tank ONGC has set up for dumping oil effluent. The police rushed to the spot and held conciliatory talks with protesters, requesting them to call off the agitation. 
 
 However, the village stood their ground, asking the authorities concerned to take necessary steps to close down the tank. The authorities had filled the tank with construction debris, on Thursday.
