NEW DELHI:   of  , an upscale locality in south Delhi, have been suffering from   and   as their   are   with   for the past  .

 The recurring problem, due to old sewer lines, has now grown both in magnitude as well as frequency. Residents rue that they have filed hundreds of complaints with the Delhi Jal Board, but only temporary arrangements have been made using super-suckers and manual intervention.
 
 Sanjiv Rao, president of the resident welfare association of the area, said that all complaints to DJB have fallen on deaf ears. “Some of us even paid bribes and kept on visiting the local jal board office to get the choked sewer cleared, but with no result. Suction machines are deployed by DJB but the problem persists. The only solution is to repair the sewer line,” Rao explained.
 
 Residents say that the choked sewer repeatedly leads to water contamination and damaged roads. “DJB officials are playing with the health and life of the resident here as the overflowing sewer has resulted in contamination of drinking water,” said Tarandeep Singh, a resident. “Every time the junior engineer comes and gets some minor work done, but problem resurfaces in a few days,” he added.
 
 Dinesh Narang, another resident said that while the population of the locality has increased over the years, the pipes haven’t been changed.
 
 Unaware of the magnanimity of the situation, a local DJB official said that the sewer lines of the area was very old and required sanctioning of large amount of funds for complete replacement. “New lines are being laid in that area and we will soon cover the entire locality. Meanwhile super-suckers are deployed to clear lines whenever the problem increases,” added the official.
