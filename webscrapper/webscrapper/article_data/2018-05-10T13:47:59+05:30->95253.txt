 "Modi has anger inside... he has anger for everybody, not just me ...and sees a threat in me," Gandhi said.
 
 Expressing confidence that the Congress would win the assembly polls in Karnataka on May 12, he said the opposition had restricted itself to making personal attacks during the campaign.
 
 The BJP, he said, feels "uncomfortable" when he visits a temple.
 
 
 
 
 "I don't think BJP understands the term Hindu," the Congress leader said.
 
 The Congress president also dismissed Modi indirectly over his mother's Italian origins.
 
 "My mother is Italian. She has lived a large part of her life in India. She is more Indian than many people I see," he said.
