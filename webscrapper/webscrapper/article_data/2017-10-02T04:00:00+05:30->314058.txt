Vadodara: Notorious bootlegger Vikram Chavada, whose diary mentioning some senior cops with ranks had created a flutter in the police department, has filed for anticipatory bail in the sessions court. The police has filed an affidavit opposing the bail but without any mention of the diary. 

 Chavada hs sought for bail saying that he is innocent and there is no prima facie case against him. His bail application also mentioned that since other accused of the case has been released on bail, he too should be allowed on grounds of parity.
 
 Cops, however, stated that Chavadaâ€™s custodial interrogation is necessary as he had been procuring liquor stock from Rajasthan and running a network in state. However, the affidavit does not mention about the diary which the state monitoring cell officials, who raided his godown on Waghodia Road, had found. The diary had mentions of names of several people and ranks of senior police officials from the city with an amount written against it, raising suspicion about alleged nexus between the cops and the bootleggers.
