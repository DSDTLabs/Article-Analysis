BENGALURU: Tata Consultancy Services reported a 0.3% rise in sequential dollar revenue in the third quarter helped by demand for digital services and improved results from its banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) and energy and utilities sectors.

 The growth was better than expected by many analysts. Though the third quarter is a seasonally weak quarter due to furloughs and the annual holiday season in the US and UK, TCS’ net profit rose 1.6% to touch the $1 billion milestone in a quarter for the first time. Operating margins remained flat at 26%, but within the company’s expected range.
 
 Revenue rose to $4.39 billion for the third quarter ended December 31, from $4.37 billion in the previous quarter. On a constant currency basis, which discounts the impact of currency fluctuations, revenue rose 2%.
 
 “For the last 5-6 quarters, there were three to four areas that were troubling us and I believe those have past their bottom, pushing us in the growth curve,” chief executive N  , who will move on from   to head the entire   next month, said in a news conference on Thursday.
 
 The areas include TCS’ weak performance in Japan and   and its UKBPO division Diligenta.
 
 While growth in Japan remained slow, Chandrasekaran said it was showing signs of improvement. Latin America grew 12.5% sequentially. “Diligenta is on the right track to deliver the right set of numbers,” he added. But Chandrasekaran also pointed out that volatility in currency movements was “too much”. This, he said, was affecting the company’s results. “We have lost about 170 bps, or about $75 million, between October and January.”
 
 During the third quarter, digital services contributed 16.8%, or $737 million, of total revenue. “Digital is doing well and will continue to grow on a good trajectory,” Chandrasekaran said energy & utilities was up 5.8% sequentially, helped by a rise in oil prices. “Energy is in for very good growth in the coming times.”
