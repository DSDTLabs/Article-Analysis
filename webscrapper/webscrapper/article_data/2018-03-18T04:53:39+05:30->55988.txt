NEW DELHI:   has been entrusted with writing the   which will help all Indian Institutes of Technology ensure the number of girl students on each campus will be at least 14%. This was decided at the   (JAB) meet here on Saturday. 

  The step is part of the government's long-term plan to increase the female representation in IITs to 20% of the total number of students by 2026. The number of girls in the   campuses are set to see a quantum leap of 14% as there will be a separate supernumerary list prepared for coming session. This will be apart from the girls shortlisted in the common list for admissions. The JAB decision came following a circular from the ministry of human resource development specifying that the number of girls to be admitted - to achieve 14%- will be "supernumerary" and the number of boys to be admitted cannot go down from the 2017 number. 
 
  "A consensus has been reached among the IITs and the JAB decided to ensure 14% supernumerary seats for girls. The numbers of the girls in the common list will not be calculated in the 14%, which means there will be more girls in the campuses now. IIT-Kanpur will write the   algorithm," said R Subrahmanyam, secretary, higher education, MHRD.
