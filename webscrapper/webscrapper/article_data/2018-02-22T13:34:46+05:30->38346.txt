PATNA: The   has decided to support any party capable of defeating the NDA nominees in the byelection to Araria parliamentary and Bhabhua and Jehanabad assembly seats on March 11, its state secretary   said on Wednesday.

 The CPI is not contesting any of the three seats. From the Left camp, only the CPI (ML) is in the fray. Kunti Devi is its candidate for the Jehanabad seat.
 
 Singh, along with party’s state secretariat member Jabbar Alam, was talking to media persons after the CPI decided to put in public domain of the state the draft national political resolution prepared for the 23rd five-day national congress/convention to be held at Kolam in Kerala from April 25.
 
 The CPI’s national position is that it would stick to Left unity and also strive to form the broad-based alliance of the Left, democratic and secular forces to defeat the BJP and the NDA in the polls. Besides, the state units would be free to support or partner with any party that is opposed to the BJP-led NDA.
 
 “As per our party’s position, we will support the CPI(ML) candidate. But we will also keep a watch on other non-NDA candidates in the fray and take the final call accordingly. The CPI will support the party that finally emerges in a position to defeat the nominee of BJP or its alliance partners,” Singh said.
 
 By that token, the CPI would support RJD in Araria and Congress in Bhabhua, but has kept its options open between the CPI(ML) and the RJD in Jehanabad.
 
 Meanwhile, as to its general campaign in the state, the party would align with the Left and like-minded parties to protest against the policies of the Centre under PM   and also highlight the failures of the   government.
