NEW DELHI:   has opened another front in its tussle with the Centre. Following Friday’s police action on the JNU students during a protest march, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged on Saturday that the professor accused of sexual harassment is being shielded because of his ties with BJP and ABVP. 

 Party spokesperson   said the action could not have been taken without direct orders from the Union home ministery, which is in charge of  . “JNU students were peacefully marching towards Parliament but the way the police have beaten them is a very dangerous sign for our democracy,” she said. 
 
 Claiming that AAP functionaries have been facing Delhi Police’s dictatorial attitude for the past three years, Marlena said, “Many of our MLAs have been manhandled.” 
 
 Party MLA   alleged that JNU professor Atul Johri, accused of sexual harassment, was being protected due to his ties with BJP and ABVP leaders. “Delhi Police did not even oppose his bail application. Now pressure is being created on the nine complainants,” she said.
 
 Lamba, who was DU students’ union president, said she had never seen students, teachers and journalists being beaten up in this manner. “The government, on the one hand, gives slogans like beti bachao but when nine daughters were raising their voices for security supported by JNU students, they were brutalised. We will meet home minister Rajnath Singh, the LG and the police commissioner for a strict action.”
 
 Recalling the police violence during the Rohit Vemula suicide protests and the Ramjas College incident, Marlena said the police had apologised only for attacking a photojournalist. “Doesn’t it show that they were targeting students?” She called the claims of Delhi Police about the students attacking and provoking the police personnel “a joke”.
 
 AAP, Lamba added, supports the cause of the JNU students and teachers. “If any more students have faced harassment, we urge them to come forward.”
