Srijit Mukherji’s   will see   U Sengupta and her daughter   for the first time together onscreen. It is a story about a young girl who is fighting a terminal disease, afather who is struggling to make his daughter`s dreams come true and about a director whose past haunts him. It starts off with Uma, a young girl brought up in Austria, being recognised with a terminal disease and goes on about how Himadri, her father takes her to Kolkata to fulfil her dream by setting up a fake Durga Puja, the most celebrated festival of the Bengalis. We ask Jisshu who is he more close to – her elder daughter Sara or the younger one Zara? “I am more close to Zara as Sara is her mom’s pet. Nilanjana and Sara are best of friends while Zara and me are a team,” said the loving father.
