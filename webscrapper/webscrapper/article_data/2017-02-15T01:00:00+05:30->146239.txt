Shahid got into the skin of his character so much, he often forgot that he was shooting. A particularly interesting incident took place when an intense battle sequence was being filmed. The scene required Shahid to run through coarse grass, gunning down enemy combatants. So engrossed was he in the scene, his heart literally skipped a beat when he fired the first shot and saw a man fall to his knees. 
 Another time, a sequence of Shahid being captured by the enemy was being shot. The scene had him crawling on all fours, carrying a rifle on his shoulders, amid heavy artillery fire. We hear, by evening that day, Shahid’s ears were ringing with the sound of explosions. But that was the least of his problems — his knees and elbows were badly bruised and his pulse rate was so high, he felt that he was returning from an actual war zone.
