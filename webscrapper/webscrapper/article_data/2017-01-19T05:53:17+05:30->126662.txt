MEERUT: The   had announced the   so that they don't have to bring their own dishes and glasses to school for   before Diwali last year but these have been provided to students in only 225 of the total 1,539 schools in Meerut. Now, with the announcement of the assembly elections, the model code of conduct came into force and the scheme has hit a roadblock as these utensils carrying stickers and stamps of the SP government can't be distributed until the polls are over.
 
   , district coordinator of midday meal, said, “We received the utensils – including plates and glasses – a day before Dhanteras to be distributed to students in the schools of the district just like in the entire state. The scheme was introduced so that students would not have to bring their own utensils to schools for midday meal.”
  
  While some of the utensils were distributed to students for regular use in schools, these could not be distributed in a majority of schools because the model code of conduct came into force.
  
  “Of the total 1,539 schools, utensils have been distributed in only 225 schools so far. There is not much that we can do because the utensils have pictures of Akhilesh Yadav and stamp of the SP government. So, we have put on hold the distribution process,” said Nagar.
  
  The initiative was brought in by Akhilesh Yadav ahead of the UP polls for over one crore students of basic and primary government schools across the state so that mid-day meals (MDM) could be served in stainless steel plates and glasses from last year's Dhanteras onwards.
  
  “Once the model code of conduct is over, the utensils will be distributed. Had the utensils reached us on time, before the model code of conduct came into force, we would have distributed them immediately,” said Nagar.
