PANAJI: Allocation of a sizeable quantum of funds for infrastructure development in key towns and villages in the Goa budget 2017-2018 is likely to accommodate the aspirations of some BJP MLAs, who missed out cabinet berths in the new government.

 Mapusa, Bicholim, Mormugao, Curchorem, Calangute, among others, are some of the towns and coastal areas that will see a flow of funds for development. MLAs from these areas could not be assigned portfolios and to keep the BJP-led coalition happy, chief minister   set aside a total budgetary outlay of Rs 35,195 lakh under municipal administration with provision of grant of Rs 500 lakh for Mapusa, Mormugao, Curchorem, Ponda and Margao municipal councils for development. Others will be allocated Rs 300 lakh and Rs 200 lakh as per their grading.
 
 In addition, special grants of Rs 20 crore each for Mapusa and Curchorem and Rs 10 crore to Bicholim municipal council for special infrastructure projects are earmarked.
 
 The compulsions of granting cabinet berths to coalition partners disappointed former power minister Milind Naik, lone woman MLA Alina Saldanha and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral. Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, who played a stellar role in government-formation, had to be content with the deputy speaker’s post. Former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza also faced relegation in order of importance in the cabinet.
 
 Considering that Mapusa is North Goa’s administrative hub and growing rapidly, the government has proposed an administrative complex at Morod to bring government offices under one roof.
 
 Rail over bridges at Sanvordem, St Jose de Areal, Chandor and Cansaulim in   have been a long-pending demands of residents and Parrikar said he would take these up with the railway ministry.
