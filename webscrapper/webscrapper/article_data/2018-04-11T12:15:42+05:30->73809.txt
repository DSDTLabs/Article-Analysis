LUDHIANA: Five days after Charanjeet Singh (50) — an auto driver from SBS Nagar — committed suicide, the   police arrested his son, Sukhdev, for abetment to suicide on Tuesday. The FIR has been lodged on the complaint of Charanjeet’s sister Rajni, who accused   of thrashing him, after which Charanjeet hanged himself from the ceiling fan inside his house.

 However, hours after Sukhdev was arrested, his siblings and in-laws gathered at Sadar police station in the evening, and staged a protest against the police, claiming it to be a case of suicide. They alleged that Charanjeet was an addict, and had committed suicide on the provocation of his sisters.
 
 After Charanjeet hanged himself on April 5, his sister Rajni complained to the police that his sons and daughter-in-law often beat him up. On April 4 also, when Charanjeet’s auto — which was on Sukhdev’s name — got fined, his son started beating him up. Rajni also alleged that when Sukhdev pushed Charanjeet, he hit the auto and sustained a deep cut, due to which he also received stitches.
 
 After investigation, the police registered a case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) against Sukhdev, and arrested him on Tuesday. Sukhdev’s sister   said: “My father was a drunkard. He often used to drink and create a nuisance in the house. He committed suicide on the provocation of his sisters. However, the police have framed Sukhdev. There was just a minor fight on April 4, after which my father fell on the auto and got himself injured.” 
 
 Sadar SHO inspector Sukhdev Singh said the police had registered a case after investigation, in which they found Sukhdev would often beat up his father. “He also thrashed his father a day before the man committed suicide,” said the SHO. However, the family said they would approach police commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill for an unbiased inquiry in the case.
