GREATER NOIDA: A 32-year-old man in a Greater Noida village allegedly throttled his wife to death with her own scarf in front of their children after she failed to prepare breakfast for him on time. 

 Neighbours rushed the woman to a private hospital but she was declared dead on arrival. The accused,  , lived with his wife   (28) and a son (7) and daughter (5) in a rented accommodation in   village.
 
 Police said the husband, a worker in a private company, often fought with his homemaker wife over trivial matters. On Saturday, too, the couple had had a fight after Rekha delayed preparing breakfast.
 
 "The husband-wife duo had a heated argument, following which the woman decided to leave the house and visit her mother's place. She had already packed her bags and was trying to leave the house with the children when Mukesh blocked her way. He caught hold of the woman's scarf and wrapped it around her neck. He then pulled the two ends with all his strength, and the woman collapsed," said Rajpal Singh  , the SHO of   III police station.
 
 The couple's two children, who were witness to the alleged murder, raised an alarm and alerted neighbours as Mukesh fled the house. Rekha was taken to a nearby private hospital, where she was declared brought dead.
 
 Police were informed and a team visited the couple's house in Kulesra village. The cops searched for Mukesh, but he was untraceable.
 
 On Sunday morning, a police team intercepted Mukesh near   and arrested him. "We have registered a case of murder under Section 302 of the IPC. The accused was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody," Tomar said.
