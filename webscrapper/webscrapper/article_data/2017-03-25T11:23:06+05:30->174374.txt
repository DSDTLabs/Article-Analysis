KOCHI: The third edition of the   introduced different facets of modern art to the city, including immersive art and participatory art to the fore through various installations that ranged from virtual reality documentaries to artistic puzzles for the audience. 

 The top five of the most noted and remarked among these were  's 'Sea of Pain', Ales Steger's 'Pyramid of Exiled Poets', Orijit Sen's 'Go Play Ces', Camille Norment's 'Prime' and Christer Lundahl and Martina Seitl's 'Symphony of the Missing Room'.
 
 While the Sea of Pain, an immersive art, demands the visitors to take off their shoes and enter a studio ankle deep in salt water in order to put them in the shoes of 5-year-old Galip Kurdi-whose shocking image showed the world the tragic plight of refugees, the Pyramid summons them to enter the pitch dark interiors of the pyramid and fumble in the dark unsure of the way, listening to the voices of the dead exiled poets that reflect their sense of rootlessness.
 
 Delhi-based Orijit Sen along with his German collaborator Guido Wolfram constructed three interactive artistic puzzles to build a participatory installation, a style of making art in which the audience is engaged directly in the creative process. The viewer has to insert missing cultural pieces with miniature models and illustrative icons given to him. In one room the puzzle is about a Muharram procession that leads to Charminar, in another room the puzzle concerns the colourful Mapusa Market in Goa. Another immersive art, 'Symphony of a Missing Room -The Mnemosyne Revolution' sees visitors don headphones that play pre-recorded instructions and ambient noise from the Biennale while trained guides provide additional effects with torches and touches.
 
 In Norment's installation, the audience are made to sit on benches that vibrate according to the resonant voices-a cross-cultural mixture of sounds, ranging from the moaning practised in Afro-American church worship, to the singing of Tibetan monks. The installation connects these cultural references to the body's experience.
