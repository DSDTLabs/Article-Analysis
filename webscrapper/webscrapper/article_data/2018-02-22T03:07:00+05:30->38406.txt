Porvorim: Panaji police will be asked to relook at a high-profile prostitution racket involving a Bollywood actress that was busted in 2015, PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, who is standing in for chief minister Manohar Parrikar, told the assembly here on Wednesday. “We will ask the department to inquire into the case,” he said. Congress MLA Nilkanth Halarnkar had raised it during Question Hour and said police had “summarily closed” the case due to “lack of evidence”. “When police raided the hotel with their own decoy, how can the case be A-Summary. The case was filed with police personnel as a key witness,” Halarnkar said, quoting police records.  In 2015, during a raid at a five-star hotel in Panaji, police had rescued a Bollywood actress and arrested a Mumbai-based pimp Ayesha Sayyed. The actress, in her statement, had said that she involved herself in prostitution for financial stability. Panaji police had been roped in by their counterparts in Mumbai to bust the high-profile racket. Police informers then negotaited a deal with the pimp. The pimp demanded over Rs 3 lakh and an advance of Rs 1.5 lakh. The informers paid the money and booked a room in the hotel. Police raided the hotel and rescued the actress. She was the shifted to a government-run women’s home and later handed over to her family members.
