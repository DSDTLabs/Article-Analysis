Salem: General secretary of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) T T V Dhinakaran has asked the cadres of BJP in the state to come forward and participate in protests seeking constitution of Cauvery Management Board (CMB).

 Dhinakaran was in Salem on Tuesday to participate in a demonstration organized by his party against the central government for delaying constitution of the board
 
 “BJP cadres in the state should not be alone when all the opposition parties are protesting for CMB,” he said. Hundreds of AMMK cadres participated in the demonstration and raised slogans against the central government for not forming CMB.
 
 Speaking to reporters after the demonstration, Dhinakaran said he did not agree on showing black flags to Prime Minister Narendra Modi while he visits Tamil Nadu on April 12. 
 
 He said the central government should take decisions without any bias by submitting draft Cauvery management scheme before May 3 to keep its ‘neutral’ position. Dhinakaran said his party would continue its protest until CMB is formed.
