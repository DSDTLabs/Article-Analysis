NAWADA: Two middle school headmasters —Onkarnath Rai and Brajesh Kumar— were arrested on Wednesday following an FIR lodged by midday meal district programme officer on the directive of   DM  . The duo defied the DM’s appeal to provide midday meal to students. 

 The District Primary School and Middle School Teachers’ Association has termed the arrest as illegal, vindictive and violation of the Patna high court order as well as the Right To Education (RTE) Act, 2009. 
 
 FIRs have been lodged against half-a-dozen middle and primary school headmasters and several contract (anubhandit) teachers of the district for not providing midday meal to the students, belonging mainly to extremely backward and dalit sections of the society.
 
 The arrest has triggered a bitter war of words between the district administration and the teachers’ association. 
 
 While the DM insisted upon the teachers and headmasters to continue providing midday meals in their respective schools, the headmasters and teachers insist their disassociation citing orders of the Patna high court and the RTE Act 2009, wherein it is clearly stated that “no teacher shall be deployed for any non-educational purposes other than the decennial population census, disaster relief duties or duties relating to elections to local authority or the state legislature or  , as the case may be”.
 
 Nawada district president of the teachers’ association,   said, “The arrest of the two headmasters was a contempt of court and we will inform the state president about the injustice. We will also take up the matter at appropriate forum.”
