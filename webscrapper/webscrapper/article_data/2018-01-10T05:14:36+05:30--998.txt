NEW DELHI: Questioning the Prime Minister’s claim about investments hitting a high,   said   should have presented the truth of economic slowdown and joblessness before PIO parliamentarians at a conference on Tuesday. 

 Congress spokesman and   MP   said, “PM Modi today said that fresh investments in three years have been the highest. It is not true. It would have been good had he said that in 2017, the investments were at a 13-year low.”
 
 He said fresh investments in 2014 totalled $16.2 trillion and came down to $7.9 trillion in 2017. “It would have been good had he given this figure as well,” he said. Babbar contrasted the PM’s speech with that of Congress president   at a meeting of NRIs in Bahrain.
 
 “One leader is expressing concern about all these issues and, on the other hand, BJP is always in election mode. The PM and his entire council of ministers reach wherever there is election. But they keep themselves away from the country’s problems,” he said.
 
 Slamming BJP for saying that Rahul was defaming the country with his statements on foreign shores, Babbar said, “There is a difference between criticism and expressing concern. When he says this, there is a concern... It is our responsibility that we talk about providing jobs, quality education and improved healthcare.”
