 The three officials, identified as G Ikuto Zhimomi, Ketouzo Peseyie and  , were arrested on Sunday. They were produced before the NIA Special Designated Court, Dimapur, the next day and were sent to two-day NIA remand. Though the NIA had sought judicial remand for the trio, they were granted bail.
 
 On Tuesday, the NIA issued fresh summons to former Nagaland CM   and his personal secretary K Francis Zeliang who were believed to present at the NIA headquarters at New Delhi on March 31. Zeliang has been asked to come with documents relevant to the payments received from the government department for the purpose of answering certain questions relating to investigation in the case. This is the third summon issued to Zeliang.
 
 The NIA first summoned Zeliang on March 13 for questioning in connection with alleged funding of banned outfits through government departments. The notice issued to Zeliang then read, 'it appears that you are acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case being investigated by the NIA.' But Zeliang wrote back to the NIA saying he would be unable to comply because the budget session was set to begin on March 13. Accepting Zeliang's request, NIA had changed the date to March 17, but Zeliang still could not go as the assembly session was in progress.
