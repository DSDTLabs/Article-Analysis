Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials have made it clear to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) authorities that they don’t have any direct role as far as action and demolition of residential and commercial buildings were concerned over their height obstructing the flight path of Surat airport. 

 AAI’s senior officials from Mumbai and Delhi met municipal commissioner M Thennarasan on Monday over the issue concerning the height of buildings. 
 
 Sources said the power to bring down buildings violating the height restriction was with the district collector. The collector has the authority to order further action and demolition of the buildings that obstruct flight path of Surat airport. 
 
 M Thennarasan told TOI, “The municipal corporation has no direct role to play as far as the building height violation is concerned. The corporation is ready to provide all the assistance as per the order passed by the district collector. The AAI should first complete the procedure.”
 
 Recently, deputy general manager (aviation safety) in Mumbai, S Mangala filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court seeking a special investigation team (SIT) to probe violation of air safety norms around Mumbai airport and alleged corruption in permission granted to buildings by top officials of AAI, directorate of general of civil aviation (DGCA), ministry of civil aviation and other authorities. 
 
 Sources said no objection certificates (NOCs) for tall buildings were granted to realtors in Surat by AAI and DGCA authorities. Based on the NoCs, realtors constructed the buildings when the airport development was still at a nascent stage. 
 
 Airport director Dilip Sajnani said, “Building permissions are given by municipal corporation and its officials do have a role here. Our officials will submit the minute of the meeting to the commissioner and then decide future course of action.”
