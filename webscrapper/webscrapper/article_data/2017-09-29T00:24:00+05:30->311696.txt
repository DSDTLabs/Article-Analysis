DMK working president M K Stalin on Thursday alleged that the local administration has come to a standstill in Tamil Nadu, and that the inaction of local bodies was the reason for the spread of   in the state.

 On Thursday, he interacted with patients admitted for dengue treatment at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital and Stanely Hospital in Chennai. Stalin referred to media reports stating that around 7,000 people have been affected by dengue in the state, and alleged that health minister C Vijaya Baskar has not revealed the number of dengue patients in the state and the extent of its spread. “Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy too appears to be unperturbed by the spread of dengue,” he alleged. “The reason for uncontrolled spread of dengue is because local bodies are inactive. Since the government has not conducted civic elections there are no people’s represenatatives in local bodies who should be preventing health hazards,” he said. He blamed local administration minister S P Velumani as well.
 
  PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss alleged that the reason dengue is spreading in the state is that the government has not implemented the Solid Waste Management Rules, revised by the environment ministry last year. He explained that the mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus usually breed in clean, stagnant water in containers such as plastic, paper and glass cups, tyres, boxes and cans.
