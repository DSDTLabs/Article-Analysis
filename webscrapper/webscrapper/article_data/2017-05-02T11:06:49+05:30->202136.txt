NEW DELHI: The  's direction for medical examination of Calcutta HC judge   created a flutter among the lawyer community which vigorously debated whether the court could force a person to undergo such a test.

 This issue was settled by a three-judge bench in a matrimonial dispute on March 28, 2003 in Sharda vs Dharampal. An HC had ordered the woman to undergo medical test as her husband had proposed so in seeking divorce on grounds of mental instability.
 
 The three-judge bench had said, "A   has the power to order a person to undergo medical test. Passing of such an order by the court would not be in violation of the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. However, the court should exercise such a power if the applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is sufficient material before the court. If despite the order of the court, the respondent refuses to submit himself to medical examination, the court will be entitled to draw an adverse inference against him."
 
 However, in the case Selvi vs State of Karnataka, the SC on May 5, 2010, had examined the validity of polygraph and narco-analysis test forced on accused. It had said, "We hold that no individual should be forcibly subjected to any of the techniques in question, whether in the context of investigation in criminal cases or otherwise. Doing so would amount to unwarranted intrusion into personal liberty.
 
 "However, we do leave room for voluntary administration of the impugned techniques in the context of criminal justice, provided that certain safeguards are in place. Even when the subject has given consent to undergo any of these tests, the test results by themselves cannot be admitted as evidence because the subject does not exercise conscious control over the responses during the administration of the test."
