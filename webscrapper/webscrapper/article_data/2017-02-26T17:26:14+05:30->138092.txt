Director Kamal's upcoming movie, Aami, a biopic on writer   has been ridden by controversies ever since it was announced. 

 After   opted out of the movie, the news making the rounds was that the director is considering   for the role of Madhavikutty. However, Kamal cleared the air saying that he hadn't even thought of considering the actress. The latest rumour is that Parvathy of Ennu Ninte Moideen fame will be cast for the role.
  Putting an end to all speculations, Kamal tells us, 'I am still on the lookout for someone who has the features of Madhavikutty. I am not in a hurry to make the movie and will patiently wait until I find the right match. It can even be a newbie.'
 
  However, the director admits that he is indeed considering a few actresses. 'People are suggesting names and I am considering them. Parvathy is also one among them but I haven't zeroed in on any one. However, I am glad that there is so much of curiosity and eagerness among the people to find a suitable actress for the character.' The reason why he chose Vidya as Madhavikutty was because of their facial similarities. 'I am not going to compromise on it at all!' he says.
 
  Aami has Murali Gopy as Madhavikutty's husband and Prithviraj playing a fictional character who leads the story. Actor Anoop Menon has also been cast in an important role.
