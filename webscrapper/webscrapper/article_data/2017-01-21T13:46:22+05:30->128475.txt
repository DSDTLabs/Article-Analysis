BERHAMPUR: People residing in   near Sorada under   on Friday staged a demonstration in front of the office of the regional chief conservator of forests (RCCF) here, demanding record of right (RoR) or land patta under the Forest Right Act (FRA). 

 Several tribal and non-tribal forest dwellers of 11 villages under Lathipada and   said they have been denied RoR under FRA even though they applied for it. 
 
 "In the name of plantation, the forest personnel has harassed us. Minor forest produce is being seized by forest personnel violating the FRA," alleged Chikaria Gamanaga, an agitator. 
 
 In the last one week, protestors claimed, forest officials seized 13 bicycles which tribal people used to transport firewood. 
 
  Protestors submitted a memorandum to the RCCF urging him to take immediate action. Tribal leader Bhala Chandra Sarangi, who led the agitation, said forest dwellers (both tribal and non-tribal) will intensify their agitation if the forest department does not take early action. 
 
 "In the name of the collecting firewood, several people cut the logs of the trees and transport them outside on cycles. We will not allow them to cut the huge trees," a senior forest officer said.
