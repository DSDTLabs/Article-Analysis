NEW DELHI: There may soon be a  ,   gadget to detect  . Researchers from IIT Delhi,   and   have developed ‘iMC2 TB Test’, which promises to bring down the detection time from four days to an hour. 

 At present, smear microscopy is used to diagnose pulmonary TB by analysis of sputum samples. The new   needs no expertise or heavy infrastructure to test sputum. 
 
 The gadget is the brainchild of Seyed E Hasnain of IIT-D who is the VC of Jamia Hamdard, Ravikrishnan Elangovan of IIT-D and Nasreen Ehtesham of ICMR. “TB is a dangerous disease that should be diagnosed and treated at an early stage. The existing diagnosis method is time-consuming and lacks desired sensitivity. We studied 49 people who were not diagnosed with TB earlier. But we found 84% of actually had TB,” said Hasnain. 
 
 The diagnostic kit costing up to Rs 500 would be designed to minimise exposure among clinical workers. Six samples could be tested at a time. The gadget is already being tested at Jamia Hamdard. The project has cost Rs 2.28 crore and comes under a centrally funded IIT-IISc joint programme. 
 
 In future, the researchers are hoping to make it as popular as the diabetes strips.
