GUWAHATI: The Assam Human Rights Commission ( ) on Thursday ordered a magisterial probe into the alleged killing of Yakub Ali in police firing during a protest in   district last week. The commission has sought the report within a month.

The rights body had received an appeal from the  , seeking this intervention.
 
 Ali allegedly died from injuries to his head from a stray bullet after police started firing in the air to disperse the group of protesters who had staged a road blockade on NH-37 at Naranarayan Setu point on June 30. He was among hundreds of agitators who were protesting against the  's practice of branding doubtful citizens as 'D' voters in the state. Once the EC marks 'D' against the names of electors who could not prove their Indian citizenship status, such 'doubtful' electors are not allowed to cast their votes or contest elections.
 
 Following the incident, Goalpara police had said police had to fire in the air to disperse the mob of around 300-400 protesters who were allegedly pelting stones on the security personnel.
 
 Eyewitnesses said, "A railway line passes by the area. Protesters picked up stones from the railway line and began throwing them at the security personnel, who also threw back stones at them. It went on for more than an hour. After that, police began firing and Yakub was hit."
 
  chief Badruddin Ajmal has demanded a judicial inquiry into the firing incident.
