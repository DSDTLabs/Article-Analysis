PATNA: The   (EOU) of state has formed its own special investigation team (SIT) to track the money transactions in the   (BSSC) intermediate level clerical examination racket. EOU IG J S Gangwar formed the team on Tuesday, a day after an SIT under Patna   was constituted on the directive of Bihar CM   to probe the job examination scam after question paper allegedly went viral on WhatsApp hours before the examination on Sunday.
 
  ASP Shushil Kumar will lead the EOU team comprising three DSPs — Anup Kumar, Sanjay Kumar and Ashok Kumar — along with two inspectors and equal number of sub-inspectors. Sources said the EOU team would investigate the money transaction made by the racketeers involved in leaking the question papers from examination halls. Several ‘scholars/experts’ have been arrested from different parts of the state.
  
  “The EOU team has sought the copy of the FIRs lodged with Muzaffarpur, Munger, Chhapra and Warisaliganj police to know the details of the arrested persons and track the money transactions made in their bank accounts,” a top EOU officer said. He also said bluetooth and other devises were recovered from the possession of candidates sitting inside the examination halls at Muzaffarpur and Chhapra during the BSSC examination on Sunday.
  
  EOU sources said their bank account details would reveal if any BSSC official or members were involved in the  . The EOU team is investigating five question paper leak-related cases as of now.
