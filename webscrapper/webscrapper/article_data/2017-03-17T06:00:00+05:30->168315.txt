BAGNAN: A   in Bagnan was beaten up, placed in a   and left for dead in a bamboo grove by her in-laws on Wednesday night. On Thursday morning, she was rescued in a semi-conscious state by locals who noticed the sack moving. 

 They informed Bagnan police station and got her admitted in   with cops’ help. Police detained her mother-in-law and two sisters-in-law, but her father-in-law and three brothers-in-law are absconding. The accused were charged under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 498A (dowry) of IPC. 
 
 Ashmira Begum’s in-laws reportedly assaulted her in a bid to make her Saudi-based husband   contribute more towards the family. According to neighbours, during Asfarul’s visit home last month, he got into a quarrel with his brothers when they asked him to double his monthly contribution to the family to Rs 50,000. He refused saying he shouldn’t have to pay so much when his wife and kids were simply living in his part of the family home. 
 
 Ashmira and her daughters live on one floor of Asfarul’s parental home in Bagnan’s Bainan locality. Besides the upkeep of his wife and kids, Asfarul also contributed to his family comprising parents, brothers and their wives, who together occupy the rest of the house.
 
 After Asfarul left, his family allegedly started torturing Ashmira regularly. They even drove her and her daughters — aged seven and four — out of the house. Ashmira then stayed at a neighbour’s house and at her parents’. On Wednesday, Ashmira and her daughters returned to the neighbour’s house. Her in-laws allegedly barged in, caught hold of Ashmira and started beating her up. 
 
 When she fell unconscious, they thought she had died and dumped her body in a sack.
