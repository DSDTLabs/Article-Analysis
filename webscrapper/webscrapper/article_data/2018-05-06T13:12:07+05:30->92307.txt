THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Though the investigation team secured the custody of   residents   (28) and   (24)-the accused involved in the alleged rape and murder of a Latvian tourist-a day ago, the team did not take them to the crime scene to collect evidence. 

 
 While seeking custody of the accused in court, police had stated that the duo had hidden important evidence such as the footwear and undergarments of the Latvian woman near the crime scene and that the items had to be recovered.
 
 Sources said on Saturday that the probe team was questioning the accused to ascertain whether they had received outside assistance in committing the crime or destroying evidence. The police are also trying to extract information on drug and   peddlers in   and Panathura regions from the accused.
 
 The accused were known for peddling ganja and had allegedly trapped the Latvian woman by offering her ganja before taking her to the secluded crime scene to kill her.
 
 A large group of people had gathered near the crime scene anticipating that police would be bringing the two accused there to collect evidence. The murdered woman's live-in partner too was among the crowd. But, they had to return after a long wait as the police team did not turn up.
 
 Meanwhile, police are yet to receive reports on chemical analysis test done on the internal organs of the deceased and that of the forensic examination. However, officers involved in the probe said that they went ahead with the arrest after receiving informal assurance from scientific experts that the tests had revealed sufficient evidence against the accused. 
 
 At present, all evidence the police have against the accused are mostly circumstantial in nature.
