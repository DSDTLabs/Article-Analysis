 "Writing, for me, is about questions—not answers. And Captain America, the embodiment of a kind of Lincolnesque optimism, poses a direct question for me: Why would anyone believe in The Dream? What is exciting here is not some didactic act of putting my words in Captain America’s head, but attempting to put Captain America’s words in my head. What is exciting is the possibility of exploration, of avoiding the repetition of a voice I’ve tired of." Coates wrote.
 
  Leinil Francis Yu, known for Phoenix Resurrection and Secret Empire, will do the interior pencils and Alex Ross, known for Marvels and Kingdom Come, will paint the covers.
