NEW DELHI: A six-year-old child was murdered by a youth who had kidnapped him and then sexually assaulted him. The incident occurred at   in southwest Delhi. 

 Police said the child was kidnapped from a lane outside his house. The kidnapper, later identified as Rohit (22), then took the boy to his room, confined him there and sexually assaulted him. Police said the boy was gagged during the assault due to which he was suffocated to death. Rohit then dumped the body outside his house and fled. 
 
 Meanwhile, the child’s father, who works at a factory at a village, approached the nearest police station to register a missing complaint. 
 
 Police launched a search during which they found the boy lying naked outside Rohit’s house. He was taken to a hospital where he was declared brought dead. 
 
 A search was launched to nab Rohit and he was picked up from a friend’s house nearby. During interrogation, Rohit claimed that he was drunk when it all happened. He said he found the child playing outside and lured him by promising him sweets. 
 
 Soon after, he forced himself on the child. But as the child cried out in pain, Rohit pressed his hand over the child’s mouth. The child choked and fell unconscious.
 
 Rohit said he then slept beside the unconscious child for a while. But when he returned to his senses, he realised that the child was dead. That’s when he decided to dump the body outside his house and go over to that friend’s house from where he was picked up. 
 
 Police said Rohit is a vagabond who had come to the city to look for work. Police said they were trying to find out if he had assaulted other children in the area as well. His cellphone has been seized to see if he clicked any photo of the child.
