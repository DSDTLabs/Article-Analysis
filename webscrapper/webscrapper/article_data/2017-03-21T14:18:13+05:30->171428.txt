Comedian   has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, of late. Reports of him assaulting good friend and co-actor   on a flight have been doing the rounds, with Kapil even accepting the fact, in a Facebook post, that he yelled and fought with Sunil. Taking it from there, Kapil has now apologised to Sunil on Twitter.
 
  Realising his mistake, Kapil took to Twitter on 20th March and wrote: Paji @WhoSunilGrover sry if I hurt u unintentionally.u knw vry well how much I luv u. M also upset .love n regards always:)
  
  
  This message to Sunil by Kapil comes in the wake of many fans wanting him back on   after the news of comedian's leaving the show emerged.
  
  
 
  
  Sunil plays Dr Mashoor Gulati and Rinku Bhabhi on Kapil's hit show, and it is the way he essays these characters that have made the audience love him even more.
  
  
 
  
  It remains to be seen if Kapil's public apology is accepted by Sunil. There are millions of fans who would want them to patch up and continue to make them laugh the same way.
