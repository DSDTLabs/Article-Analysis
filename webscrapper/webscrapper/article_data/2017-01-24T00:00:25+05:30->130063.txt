Indore: All three witnesses who were scheduled to appear before a special CBI court court to testify in the trial against SIMI mastermind Safdar Nagori, could not depose before the court on Monday. The prosecution had cited insufficient time, whereas the defense stated the absence of witnesses being the reason. Atul Pathak and Ashutosh Sharma, independent witnesses testifying on behalf of the CBI, will now be examined on February 2. According to defense advocate Chandan Airen, both Pathak and Sharma did not appear before the court till lunch time due to which the case was adjourned for the day. Forensics expert from Sagar, Narendra Singh was also expected to depose before the court on Monday. Despite having issued bailable arrest warrants against him, Singh’s testimony has been pending before the court for a long time. Judge BK Paloda on Monday issued bailable arrest warrants against Singh again and asked him to appear before the court on February 3. The prosecution also stated that the connectivity for video conferencing of the accused from Sabarmati Jail, Ahmedabad could not be established on Monday as they were appearing via video conferencing for another trial which was being held in Karnataka. “On Saturday, former district magistrate of Dhar Rajkumar Pathak testified before the court and stated that he had issued prosecution sanctions for seven accused under the Arms Act and from among these seven, he had also issued prosecution sanctions for three accused under the Explosive Substances Act,” public prosecutor Vimal Kumar Mishra said. The seven accused were arrested from a flat above Gafur Khan’s bakery in Sanyogitaganj on the intervening night of March 27 and 28, 2008, by the STF. Safdar Nagori, along with ten other SIMI operatives, is being tried before the special CBI court here for possessions of arms and explosive substances and also for plotting a terrorist attack.
