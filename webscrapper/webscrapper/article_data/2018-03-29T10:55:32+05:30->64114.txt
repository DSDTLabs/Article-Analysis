CHANDRAPUR: Standing committee chairman Rahul Pawde’s alleged statement that disabled people come to the corporation to seek publicity stirred a controversy during the general body meeting of   (CMC) on Wednesday. 

 Opposition corporators staged sit-in in the well and took the ruling BJP to task over the statement, forcing mayor Anjali Ghotekar to tender an apology before the house to resolve the matter. 
 
 Ruling BJP in CMC is under criticism from opposition for not using a single penny from the allocation of over Rs1 crore for specially-abled people in 2017-18. Disabled people had staged protest at CMC on Tuesday during the budget meeting. 
 
 Things turned ugly on Wednesday when corporator   questioned the norms on which Gajanan Construction Company’s additional bill was approved by the standing committee. As Congress corporator Nandu Nagarkar waved a banner alleging corruption in the affair, Pawde turned furious and charged that banners are waved for publicity and even disabled people come to CMC for publicity. 
 
 Opposition corporator including Deshmukh, Nagarkar and Anil Rameteke flayed Pawde’s statement. Pawde denied of making any insulting statement about disabled people. He maintained that the subject on agenda was only to provide the information of standing committee proceedings to the house, not to discuss it.
