 dropped by a Durga puja pandal in Juhu, which is organised by his filmmaker best friend Ayan Mukerji's extended family. 

  
  
 Dressed in a peach kurta, the actor was joined by their upcoming superhero film's leading lady, Alia Bhatt, and served bhog at the pandal, much to the delight of other devotees who had turned up to pay respects on Navami.
 
 Around 4pm, he headed to  's design store in the vicinity to pick up a few pieces for his new digs.Gauri, who ventured in interior designing a few years ago, had helped him do up his house, where he moved earlier this year from grandmother Krishna  's residence, before providing inputs to Karuna Dhawan as she decorated actor-son Varun's new house.
 
 RK spent two and a half hours browsing through decorative pieces and furniture. After shortlisting some statement chairs, among other things, he sat down with Gauri for an hour to discuss how to place his latest purchases around the house.
 
 "Gauri knows how to make a house a home without compromising on the style quotient," Ranbir told Mirror, impressed with her contribution to his pad.
