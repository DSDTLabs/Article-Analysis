Lucknow: Surgeons at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee   have removed an   tumour from a woman’s abdomen.

 “The   was not only big, its roots were deeply ingrained in the woman’s utreus, and small and large intestines. What added to the challenge was that the patient had undergone a caesarean section thrice which left little place for us to make the incision for the surgery,” said Dr RK Gautam who performed the surgery. 
 
 The patient, Bina Singh, a resident of Alambagh, developed tumour following hormonal imbalance which is common after pregnancy. “The problem grows big with the tumour because women often ignore the initial warning signs like pain and discomfort in abdomen, especially while walking, vaginal bleeding, irregular menstrual cycle, backache and lethargy,” he explained.
 
 Dr Gautam said ignoring symptoms could result in more serious problems like cancer.
