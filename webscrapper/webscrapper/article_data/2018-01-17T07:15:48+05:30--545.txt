NEW DELHI: The only person missing was Jeff Bezos! When yoga guru   decided to announce an online push for his   company Patanjali, the who’s who of Indian e-commerce industry — from Paytm founder   to Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy — turned up to join him on stage.

 Despite his staunch swadeshi stance, Ramdev decided to take the help of top e-commerce firms, even the foreign ones, to make inroads into India’s fast-growing online FMCG market. While Patanjali claimed it raked in Rs 10 crore through online sales in December from its own e-commerce platform Patanjali Ayurved, Ramdev estimated that online sales will contribute 15 per cent to Patanjali’s turnover in a few years. “Online mechanism aims to provide convenient and efficient option along with extension of traditional retail market,” he said.
