 Vigeesh has left his home a few years go after he was in debt following the collapse of a chit fund business he was managing.Though there was no information about his whereabouts for quite some time, police sources said he was involved in some shady business in the interiors of Palakkad and used to come to his native place very rarely.There were reports that he visited home nearly eight months ago.
 
 “Whatever be the claim of the CPM, in our inquiry , it has been confirmed that he belongs to a CPM family and the involvement of his brothers in criminal cases, including the role of Sajilesh in Kathiroor Manoj murder case, underscores what their politics is,“ said senior BJP leader and former district president K Ranjith.
 
 However, Kathiroor police said that Vigeesh was involved only in one case, a scuffle, in 2012 but was acquitted later.
