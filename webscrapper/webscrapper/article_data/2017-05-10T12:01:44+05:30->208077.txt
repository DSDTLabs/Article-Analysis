NEW DELHI: Having advised   to adopt a conciliatory approach in its dealings with the   (ICC) following a row over revenue sharing, the   (CoA) has now extended an invitation to ICC chairman   to attend the   final in Hyderabad on May 21.

 This is seen as a move to build bridges with Manohar after BCCI suffered a huge setback at the   last month, losing the vote over the finance model by a 9-1 margin. With ICC's offer of an additional $100 million to BCCI still open, the move may lead both BCCI and Manohar to initiate the negotiations once again.
 
 "The invitation has gone to Manohar on Tuesday. This is a good opportunity for the board officials to sit across the table and sort out all the differences with ICC in terms of finance and governance models," a source told TOI.
 
 Board sources said that talking to Manohar first before thrashing out the finance and governance issues with other full members would be an important step. A few board members who attended Sunday's board   in the Capital are also of the understanding that Manohar's stand on the distribution of ICC's revenue is something which can keep the world crick et in balance. This is a far cry from the strident stand a section within the BCCI had taken in the wake of grave differences with ICC over the new finance model which is set to considerably cut down India's share in the global cricket pie.
