 The vast background of the pandal will give a glimpse of a palace in antique golden tone in which the 15-feet high Durga idol will be placed. The interiors of the pandal will also have the look of an old-styled grand palace.
 
 Nitesh Awasthi, one of the organisers, told TOI, “Everybody is aware of the craze around Bahubali, so we wanted to give people a glimpse of it and make their experience memorable.While the movie's style will be used for decoration, the murti and puja will be done in the traditional way.“ Another attraction this year will be the huge 15X50 feet stage at Chowk Durga Puja. Built in three parts, the composite structure consists of 18 figurines and gives out a message of women empowerment.
 
 Niloy Mitra, the artist constructing the idol, said this is the biggest structure he has ever made on Durga Puja. “The Durga murti will be between the idols of two demons, Shiva and Brahma. The lower part of the structure will show a woman getting tortured by a man and the next scene will be how she fights back symbolising the power of womanhood. The structure will cost around Rs 1.5 lakh,“ he said.
 
 The Durga Puja pandal at LDA Kanpur road will ha ve a dragon symbolic of the tension in Doklam. Anirudh, one of the organisers, said, “We will try and create a 3D effect with the use of light and sound. It will show Goddess Durga slaying the dragon,“ he said.
