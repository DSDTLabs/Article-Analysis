GUWAHATI: Two years ago, Rohan and his brother Angel were taken away from Sadiya to   by an 'uncle' from their locality. 

 Before they could realize what was happening, they were engaged as domestic helps. On Saturday, Assam Police in a joint operation with their counterpart in Arunachal Pradesh rescued Angel from   and Rohan from Pasighat. 
 
 "Their father, a daily wage worker called  , had sold them to a trafficker in 2014 for Rs 5,000. Israil was sick and unemployed at the time. Taking advantage of the situation, a trafficker offered him money and said his kids would get jobs in Arunachal Pradesh. He was an easy prey," said a   officer. A search operation is currently on to nab the unidentified 'uncle'. The two households in Arunachal Pradesh who employed them are being questioned by the cops as well.
 
 With over 1,494 cases of trafficking in 2015, Assam recorded the highest number of cases of human trafficking in the country. Assam also has the highest number of child trafficking cases (1317). The track record of action being taken in such cases is a dismal one. While 1,552 persons were arrested in Assam in 2015 for involvement to human trafficking networks, police had filed chargesheets in only 365 cases against 424 accused, of whom only eight were convicted.
 
 Recurring floods, militancy, poverty, lack of employment avenues are often behind such cases. The chairperson of the Assam State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Runumi Gogoi, said, "The school dropout rate in the tea garden areas is as high as 75%. Because of the lack of education and economic backwardness, it becomes easier for traffickers to lure children and youths from these areas."
