After Lord Livingstone 7000 Kandi, director Anil Radhakrishnan Menon has roped in   again for his upcoming film titled Diwanji Moola Grand Prix.

 The filmmaker tells us, “Kunchacko is part of the cast and will be playing a bureaucrat. It’s a completely different role from the last film we did together. His character as the government official is an inspiring figure in the society and is one of the several pivotal characters in the social satire.”
 The movie, which is co-scripted by Anil and collector Prashanth Nair, also has Nyla Usha, Nedumudi Venu, Ketaki Narayan, Rajeev Pillai, Sudheer Karamana, Joy Mathew and Shaheen Siddique in important roles. Apart from them, the director says that the film will also introduce a host of new faces.
 
 “We have auditioned a lot of talents and have chosen close to 15 debutants to be part of the film,” says Anil, adding that the movie will go on floors by next week.
 
 While it’s a social satire, the director says the film will also have bike racing as part of the story. “There will be thrilling elements in the movie as well as comedy. All my films till date have been different from each other. This too will be unique in that sense,” he says. The movie has Thrissur as the main location. The movie is co-produced by Anil under the banner Mars Entertainment.
 
 Meanwhile, Kunchacko Boban is currently awaiting the release of Ranjith Sankar’s   and has also signed Sidharth Bharathan’s Varnyathil Aashanka… Athu Thaan Alleyo Ithu?
