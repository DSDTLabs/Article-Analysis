MUMBAI: The mysterious twist in this ‘murder’ case could make the cops bleat. 

 Months after the   police arrested two men for allegedly murdering their neighbour, a recent test at   in Byculla has shown that the murdered man’s bones are those of a goat!
  
 It all began in September last year. Samadhan Sonawane (20) informed the family of a missing youth,   (23), that Borse had been murdered but refused to divulge details. Borse’s mother, Leelabai, approached the police. Sonawane, who was detained, told the police that another man,   (25) was also part of the conspiracy. The two were then arrested for kidnapping.
 
 Police inspector IV Vishwakarma said that the two men admitted that in May they had drinks with Borse when they got into an argument. “Kadam confessed to having smashed a bottle on Borse’s head after which Borse passed out. The two men fled to Nashik.” Police sources said that Kadam had attacked Borse for passing comments at his wife.
  
 “Five months after the incident, we took the two men to the crime scene, but did not find Borse’s mortal remains. But buried at that place were some bones, a torn shirt, a pair of jeans and one sandal. Borse’s brother identified his torn shirt,” said the officer.
  
 While the clothes and sandal were sent for analysis to Nashik, the bones were sent to JJ Hospital. “Two witnesses told a magistrate that they had seen dogs eating parts of human flesh. They kept mum, fearing involvement in police formalities,” said the officer. 
 
 Kadam and Sonawane are currently lodged in Nashik jail.
