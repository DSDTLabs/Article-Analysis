 gets ready for his sister-in-law  's "gauna" with the bride's outfit and jewellery. He tells them to come to the temple for the   ceremony in the evening that day.
 
  Kanak comes home excited to tell   and   whatever happened at the exhibition and shows them the head accessory which   had helped her wear. She tells them that she won't take it off even at night now. Babasa and Meena are happy to see her talk like that.
  
  The neighbouring women come home and mock Meena and her son Golu. Dai sa calls out for Bhabho and asks her why she didn't tell anyone about Kanak's wedding? She tells her to do a ritual for Kanak. Meena asks Kanak to go and get dressed for the ritual.
  
  At the ritual, Bhabho follows the tradition and does everything for her. She also misses those days when she became a mother to Sooraj. There is dance and fun among the family members at the ceremony.
  
    and Vansh are happy to see their sister come and dance with them.
