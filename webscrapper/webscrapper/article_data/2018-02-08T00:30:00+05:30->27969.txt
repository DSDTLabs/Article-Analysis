Bengaluru: Kundalahalli-based Kalyani Motors Service Centre was booked in connection with the deaths of a 30-year-old woman and her four-year-old   in their car, which went up in flames in the basement of their Whitefield apartment last week.

 In his police complaint, Rajesh K, husband of deceased Neha Verma, accused the service centre staff of apathy while servicing the vehicle, resulting in the accidental fire that charred his wife and son Param to death in their Maruti Ritz on February 2.
 
 According to Rajesh, the car had been sent for service to Kalyani Motors six months ago, and the staff seemed to have erred while handling the vehicle.
 
 “Rajesh has sought legal action against the staff of Kalyani Motors, saying faulty servicing may have resulted in the fire. We have registered an FIR under IPC-304A (causing death due to negligence),” police said.
 
 A spokesman for Kalyani Motors said they are cooperating with police in the probe. “Our records show the Maruti Ritz was serviced in February 2017. Around six months ago, a team from our service station had attended to the car which broke down. During inspection, our staff had noticed that the electrical equipment hadn’t been switched off by the customer, resulting in the battery discharging,” the spokesman said, adding, “We are in touch with police and are waiting for the forensic report.”
