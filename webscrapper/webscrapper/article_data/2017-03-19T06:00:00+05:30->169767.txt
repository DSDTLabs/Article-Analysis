The trailer of   has just one dialogue, and that sums up what the film is all about — Power Star  . “Enthamandi unnarannadi mukhaym kadu. Evadu uannadu anedi mukhyam,” goes the dialogue. Loose translation: It does not matter how many people are around, what really matters is who is it that is around. “People will come back to the theatres again and again just to watch Pawan Kalyan. You will not be able to get enough of him,” declares director  , aka Dolly. 
A remake of Kollywood star Ajith’s blockbuster Veeram, the film is a high voltage action drama that is a “perfect blend of romance and action”, says Dolly. “I was working on another script for Pawan Kalyan when producer   told me about his plan to remake Veeram. I knew it would be perfect for the Power Star. It has a beautiful love story besides oodles of high octane action. And it’s not forced action sequences, mind you. Both romance and action are intrinsic to the narrative,” says the director. Talking about Pawan Kalyan’s characterisation, in the film releasing on March 24, under Northstar Entertainment banner, the filmmaker says, “Pawan plays the patriarch of a family of five brothers. He is a larger than life man with a heart of gold and is respected by everyone in the village. He will be seen rocking the panchekattu all through the film.” The most endearing part of the film however will be the protagonist’s love story. “He is someone who hates women and has never been in love. What happens when he falls in love with   is going to be the highlight of the movie,” says Dolly, adding, “Pawan is a very natural performer and his acting in the film is something that has to be seen to believed. He has delivered his best performance till date.”
