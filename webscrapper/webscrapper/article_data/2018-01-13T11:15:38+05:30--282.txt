COIMBATORE: A city-based architecture institute has come up with a vision for Race Course, keeping the population of 2050 in mind. Students of the Sasi   of Architecture submitted the proposal to city corporation commissioner   on Friday.

 “The Race Course area has a floating population of 12,000 and nearly 700 houses. But, there are neither public transport nor focus on green spaces and public spaces. Nearly 40 students conducted various studies on topography, land use, traffic, transportation, sensory and landscape studies in the last five months and prepared the detailed proposal,” said principal of the Sasi Creative School of Architecture Mohammed Ali Sharieff.
 
 Vijayakarthikeyan said that the civic body, which was planning a revamp of the Race Course area, will accommodate the suggestions. “Wherever it is possible, we will use the suggestions and include it in the plan,” he said.
 
 The commissioner also asked the students to come up with more studies and ideas for the development of the city. “Small ideas can bring big changes if executed well. Architecture students should come up with ideas for civic issues,” he said.
 
 According to the college officials, the students had come up with eight futuristic possible development options. Major aspects were green space development, exclusive bicycle track, integrating the residential community, creating recreational zone and a neighbourhood that is self-sufficient. The proposal will be submitted to various public forums and suggestions will be sought.
 
 “Cities need to plan ahead if they have to develop. So, we will continue to create visions for various other areas in the city and hope that they get implemented,” said Ali Sahrieff.
