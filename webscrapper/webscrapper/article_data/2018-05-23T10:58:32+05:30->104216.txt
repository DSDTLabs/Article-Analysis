AJMER: A special court for SC/ST cases on Monday awarded life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on a person accused of raping a minor girl who was on her way to the school. In his order, judge   said that the girl knew the accused so she trusted him that he would leave her till the school. But the accused instead took her elsewhere and raped her. The accused too was a student and such crimes are increasing, especially in this age group. He added that if such crimes are not strictly restricted then they will increase in the coming years.

 At the time of the incident the girl was 15 and the boy was 18 and they both belonged to the same village. The court observed that strict punishment was necessary so that minor girls can go to school without any fear. According to prosecutor  , one   of   village on August 29, 2013 on his way to school met a 15-year-old girl who was also going to her school. He told the victim that he would drop her till her school but requested her that they would go around the village on his bike. The survivor trusted   but he took the girl to different places and raped her several times.
 
 When the girl did not return her father began searching for her. He came to know that his daughter did not attend the school too. In the evening the father registered a police complaint. Police at late night found Ranjeet and the girl when they were coming back to the village. They arrested Ranjeet and took the survivor for medical. Jain said that they produced eight witnesses and 25 documents to prove that Ranjeet is guilty. The court, after the argument on Monday, gave life imprisonment and also other sentences under different sections to Ranjeet. He was also fined.
