About 25 of worldâ€™s prominent surgeons were treated to a special reception party by   recently. The dinner party for surgeons, who came down from the UK, was one fun do as the docs were seen chit-chatting not only about medicine, but about everything under the sun. Dr Raghuram played the perfect host making sure everyone was taken care of while the sumptuous food and delish cocktails made it one hearty party.
