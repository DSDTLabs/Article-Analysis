NEW DELHI: While Delhi Daredevils have kept alive their   playoff hopes with a narrow D/L method win over Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday, two of their players have made the Orange and Purple Caps their own.

 
 
 
 New Zealand fast bowler   has surged into lead position on the IPL 2018 bowling table, taking his season tally to 13 and thus assuming ownership of the   for most wickets, while his team-mate  , who before this match was at fourth spot on the batting chart with 306 runs from eight innings, has moved up to No 1 following his crackling half-century. 
 
 
 
 
 Boult’s returns of 2/36 from three overs on Wednesday saw him move ahead of Siddarth Kaul, Hardik Pandya, Umesh Yadav and Mayank Markande. Heading into Wednesday’s single IPL fixture, all five bowlers had been level on 11 wickets. 
 
 Pant’s strong tournament continued with a rollicking 29-ball 69, inclusive of five sixes and seven fours, and moved him past Ambati Rayudu (370 runs), Virat Kohli (349) and Kane Williamson (322) to the No 1 spot. However, given that Chennai Super Kings are in action today, Pant does not look like holding onto the   unless Rayudu falls for under five runs. 
 
 Daredevils captain Shreyas Iyer has moved upto fifth place with 307 runs, having scored 50 against Rajasthan. 
 
 With this win, Daredevils also lifted themselves off the bottom place on the IPL 2018 leaderboard, while shoving Rajasthan to seventh place.
