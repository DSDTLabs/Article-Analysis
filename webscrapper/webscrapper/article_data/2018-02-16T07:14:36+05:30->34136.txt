LUCKNOW: In a development which could probably put the   on a collision course,   on Thursday refused to abide by the directives of   asking the state government to get a   conducted into three cases of alleged   in Gautam Budh Nagar.

 Questioning the chairman’s direction issued two days ago, Yogi said the Central agency did not come under the jurisdiction of the state government. “We should not make a mockery of ourselves through such directives,” Yogi said while speaking in the Vidhan Parishad on Thursday.
 
 Yogi’s statement evoked sharp response from opposition members who said that the government was challenging the authority of chair.
 
 As Samajwadi Party legislators began raising slogans, leader of opposition Ahmad Hasan asked: “Ab kya peeth ki koi haisiyat nahi rah gayi?” (Does the chair have no significance now?) When cabinet minister Mahendra Singh objected and asked the chairman to intervene, the chair reserved its decision on the matter.
 
 On Tuesday, when the chairman issued the directive for a CBI probe into three encounters, Mahendra Singh had sent a letter to Yadav raising questions.
 
 “No discussion was held in the house and direction for a CBI probe was issued by you. Such directions can only be given by courts and therefore your decision is beyond constitutional provisions,” Singh wrote in the letter.
