It's been just less than a week since the   -   movie 'Godha' hit theaters, but the film's pirated copies are already out on social media.

 The movie's producer, director, composer and actors have been actively voicing out their angst through social media about piracy, for the past few days. The film's producer C V Sarathi said, "With the implementation of GST, come August 1st we may end up paying 54% tax per ticket... pirated copies of all the recently released movies like Sakhavu, Lakshyam, CIA and Godha are out on the net. Ours is a state where we have given more than 25 crores theatrical share for BAHUBALI 2 despite it's pirated copies circulating from day two of it's release...So audience is not averse to coming into theaters...We cannot match neither their grandeur nor their huge budgets with our limitations."
 
 The film's director   mentioned that he has filed a complaint in cyber cell regarding the incident. "We have entrusted two of the best companies in India along with the support of Kerala Film Producers Association and Kerala Film Chamber to investigate the matter. So far we have received around 359 IP numbers and we are in discussion with legal team for filing a mass action lawsuit.Investigation team has assured us that under 3 to 4 days,they will pinpoint the exact theatre were the pirated video was taken. Let this not happen to any other movie in our industry, let us all stand together to find the exact culprits.Meanwhile thank you all once again for being with us and thank you for making Godha a big success."
 
 Meanwhile, Shaan Rahman, it's composer, had also mentioned on his social media page about the struggles and hardships the team took to get the film to theaters.
