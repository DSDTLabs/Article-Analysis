BENGALURU: The state   coordination committee meeting in Bengaluru on Sunday will explore drafting senior ministers for party work with   due in 2018. 

  If the leadership decides to pull out ministers in the cabinet since government formation in May 2013, it'll be following the Congress high command's norm of drafting senior ministers for party work ahead of polls. There are about 13 ministers in Siddaramaiah's cabinet, who were inducted in 2013. 
 
 An indication that the issue would figure in the meeting was given by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president G Parameshwara who told reporters here on Saturday that during elections, the services of senior ministers are used. "I have an open mind on this. The final decision has to be taken by chief minister Siddaramaiah. It's likely to come up for discussion,'' he added.
 
 However, KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao in a separate news conference chose to differ. 
 
 "Having completed four years in power, it would be madness on our part to consider any cabinet reshuffle at this juncture. The agenda is not yet finalized," Rao said. A senior minister said the meeting will discuss what kind of a budget Siddaramaiah should present on March 15. 
 
 According to sources, Parameshwara is keen on revamping the KPCC, a task pending since 2010. The proposal is to give an opportunity to youngsters and old-timers in the party some of the posts. The immediate challenge for the chief minister will be the bypolls to Chamarajanagar and Nanjangud assembly constituencies.
 
  general secretary   arrived late Saturday evening and held preliminary discussions with party seniors.
