New Delhi: The   for   on Monday shared data, which highlighted the extreme vulnerability of children across the country to sexual abuse. It also decided to set up a National Alliance Against Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation, in collaboration with other stakeholders. 

 The ministry held a day-long meeting to work out the modalities for the “National Alliance”.

 Recognising that child sexual abuse needs urgent attention, the National Commission for   last year launched the POCSO e-box to enable children to approach it by simply registering their email ID and contact number, along with the nature of their complaint. The e-box has received 157 complaints so far. 
 
 NCPCR chief Stuti Kaicker told TOI, “The complaints are coming from different parts of the country and so far most of the cases pertain to children in the age-group of 12-16 years.” 
 
 Between 2013 and 2016, DCPCR intervened and sought action taken reports in 356 cases of children who became victims of sexual assault in Delhi. 
 
 A report by DCPCR in 2015 showed the average pendency of cases registered under POCSO Act in Delhi’s children’s courts during 2013-14 was as high as 85%.
