Udhagamandalam: About two-week-old carcass of an aged tiger was found in Masinagudi range of forest in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris on Wednesday evening. It was found near Avarallah river, forest department officials said.

 Government veterinarians Rajamurali and Krishnamurthi conducted postmortem as per the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on Thursday. “The carcass must be around two weeks old. It was highly decomposed. Parts like nails and bones were washed away. We could recover about 12 nails and some bones from the river,” deputy director of MTR buffer zone Pushpakaran told TOI.
 
 However, the officials could not identify the sex of the animal. “It might have died due to infighting. An injury on its head and nail marks on the nearby trees indicate a fight with another carnivore. The yellow canines indicate it was an aged,” he said. TNN
