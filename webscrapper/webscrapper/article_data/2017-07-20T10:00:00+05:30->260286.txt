Estrogen, the  , has long been considered to protect women from heart failure and inflammation, and has been linked to the reason, why women may live longer than men. This protection is compromised in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a condition in which above-normal levels of the male hormone, testosterone, are produced. In recent times, plant-based estrogens have been shown to perform similar protective functions as  , and a clinical trial that concluded recently demonstrated measurable benefits of   isoflavone supplementation, particularly in women who had been diagnosed with PCOS.

 The clinical trial evaluated the impact of including soy isoflavones in the diet of women with PCOS. Seventy women with PCOS participated in the study. Half of the study population received 50 mg/day soy isoflavone supplement every day for 12 weeks, while the other half received a placebo. The subjects were required to maintain their level of physical activity, and to avoid any other nutritional supplements during the course of the study. Samples of blood were collected from all participants to measure their hormone and lipid levels, along with markers of insulin resistance. Soy supplementation was found to reduce the levels of circulating insulin, as well as the markers of insulin resistance, suggesting protection from Type 2 diabetes, compared to women who received the placebo. In addition, women who took soy isoflavones had lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, testosterone and triglycerides, suggesting that they were protected against heart disease as well. The results of the trial indicate that women with PCOS would benefit from regular supplementation with soy isoflavones, particularly in terms of their metabolic and heart health.
