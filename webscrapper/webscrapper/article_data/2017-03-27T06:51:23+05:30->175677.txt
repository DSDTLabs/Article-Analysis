GUWAHATI: Asked to explain the presence of a garbage dumping site in Boragaon near Deepor Beel, a Ramsar wetland, the state government has informed the   (NGT) that the site did not violate any law. 

 In an affidavit submitted to the NGT earlier this month, chief secretary   stated that the location of the dumping site did not violate any provision of law. The NGT is hearing a case filed by environment activist   against the   (GMC)'s garbage dumping site near the Deepor Beel wildlife sanctuary on the outskirts of the city.
 
 The state government's affidavit informed the NGT that the district administration had taken the recent deaths of greater adjutant storks on the eastern fringes of Deepor Beel very seriously.
 
 In January this year, 22 greater adjutant storks were found dead in Deepor Beel. The report on the cause of death is yet to come out. Greater adjutant storks are highly endangered and protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.
 
 Last month, the NGT had also taken note of the bird deaths, saying the applicant had drawn the attention to an alarming incident in which at least 20 greater adjutant storks were found dead at a spot close to the GMC's garbage dumping site.
 
 The NGT, in its order on March 10, had directed the state government to file the management plan for long-term protection of the Deepor Beel after two months. The state government's additional advocate general   had informed the NGT that the management plan was being prepared by IIT-Kharagpur and had prayed for three months' time to place it on record.
