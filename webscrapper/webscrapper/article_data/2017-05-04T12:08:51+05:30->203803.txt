UDUPI: Ignored until now, the breathtaking  , 40km north of  , in Udupi district, is being developed by the tourism department. Though it has a stunning seascape, the main hurdle for this tourist destination has been lack of road links.

 Tourists who drive to this place on NH17 get the   on the west and the river   on the east flanked by NH17. At Othinene, one can view the beautiful merger of the river and the sea. From the highway to the viewpoint, there was a mud road and vehicles couldn't use it. The 1.2-km walk would put off tourists. The spot itself is managed by the forest department.
 
 Last year, the tourism department earmarked Rs 1 crore for the construction of a 1.5-km approach road. With forest department aid, a View Point (like in  ) has been constructed at a cost of Rs 1 lakh. Last year, a children's playground was constructed. There are seven cottages, two A C and five nonAC. There's accommodation for 25 people.
 
 Prabhakar Kulal, By ndoor RFO, said, “Once the approach road is ready, it will definitely make a difference. As the construction is going on, the number of tourists has come down. Usually, 100 people visit Othinene to view the sunset every evening. This place gets very little publicity . The number of new tourist is not much but there are many repeat visitors. People who come to   could come here to stay. The place is cool and peaceful.“
 
 He added, “We have a one cook, two room boys and a deputy ranger. October to February is considered the best time to visit. After monsoon, the place is at its best, with beautiful wildflowers.Some film units come here for shooting.“
