LUCKNOW: Birthdays are special to all and city's most revered   is no exception. But unlike commoners, the lord will wear designer clothes on his   to be celebrated like every year as   on Tuesday. 

 The deity at   is most likely to wear a handmade outfit designed by Sonika Gupta, an Aliganj housewife, while Lete Huye Hanumanji will be draped in a ‘chadar’ (sheet) designed by Indiranagar-based Sunita Batra. 
 
 A chola set for the idol at Hanuman Setu includes a dhoti and a chadar while that for Lete Huye Hanumanji consists of a langot, a Ramnaami and a chadar. Clothes are offered to the deity along with saffron vermilion, jasmine oil, garlands and sweets amidst chant of mantras. 
 
 Hanuman Setu secretary   said Hanuman Jayanti is not the only occasion when new clothes are offered to the deity. “Devotees come to dress up the deity in their moments of happiness, so much so that we have a waiting list of at least two months,” he said. 
 
 Some people come up without booking. “Birthdays, anniversaries, festivals, weddings, child-birth, results are some occasions when they offer chola to the deity,” said Sunil Gomber, associated with the Lete Huye Hanuman ji Temple Trust. 
 
 Known for making the dress to order, Sonika has sold more than 30 chola sets in the past one week. “The only way to ensure a devotee gets a distinct piece is to make limited number of sets,” said Sonika, who turned to designing to support her husband who after he suffered huge loss in business. “God provided solution to my crisis and has given me an identity,” said Sonika who supplies clothes to Sai Baba, Radha Krishna and Devi temples. Sunita Batra of Manas Vihar Indiranagar is another popular designer for deities. “I began with designing a chadar I wanted to offer and its unique design made people place orders and now I am booked for the entire year,” she said.
