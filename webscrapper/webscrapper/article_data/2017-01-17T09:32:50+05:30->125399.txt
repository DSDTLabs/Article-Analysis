Michelle Dockery and Miko Hughes starring drama "Good Behavior" has been renewed for a second season by TNT.
 
  The network also announced that season two would consist of 10 episodes and will premiere in the fall, reported AceShowbiz.
  
  "Fueled by unsinkable characters on a dangerous search for belonging, love and family, 'Good Behavior' is addictive television show," said Sarah Aubrey, executive VP of original programming for TNT.
  
  "Millions of viewers have fallen hard for this sexy, complicated couple, and in season two, Letty (Michelle Dockery) and Javier (Juan Diego Botto) will give us plenty more to obsess about," Aubrey added.
  
  Based on the novella series by Blake Crouch, the drama follows Letty Raines, a thief and con artist fresh out of prison trying to stay afloat and reunite with her 10-year-old son who is currently being raised by her mother Estelle (Lusia Strus).
