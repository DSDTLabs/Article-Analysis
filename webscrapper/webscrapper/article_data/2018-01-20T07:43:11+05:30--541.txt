 "An amendment was made to Section 32A of the Registration Act, 1908, to introduce the new system. Aadhaar verification will fulfil the requirements of Section 32A of the Registration Act, 1908, which relates to compulsory affixing of photograph," said an official at the state inspector-general of registration (IGR) office.

 "With about 90% adults having Aadhaar cards, the process would be simpler and transparent," said the official at the IGR office, adding that the consent-based Aadhaar authentication service would be cost-effective and fully auditable.
 
 The online Aadhaar verification was on for leave and licence registration. "The same will be done for the registration of new properties," said a senior official in the IGR's office.
 
  More than 7,000 documents are registered across the state daily and about 24 lakh registrations take place in a year.
