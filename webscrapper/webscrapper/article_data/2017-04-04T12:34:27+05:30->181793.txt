 'Sa Vidya Ya Vimuk taye', or 'knowledge liberates' was the traditional sutra that made India a  .   also echoed that education was the best weapon to change the world. It was going pretty well up to 1975. State boards were considered better than national board then with hard-earned marks, not by default. Students of UP and Bihar boards were preferred for quality.
 
 Slump began after failure of   experiment in the 1970s. Political chaos gave birth to a class that didn't believe in quality. These politicians ventured into various businesses that included education sector which was going out of control of the government as it did not have enough funds for new institutions. Criminals took over and ventured into education field for money as well as respectability. Thus, politician-criminal nexus in educationwas complete. Governments, mean while also started using educational certificates for job offers particularly at lower level   and that destroyed morality and righteousness in education. Individual performance also became best indicator of admission prospects in universities. Knowledge didn't matter, marks did. Perfect 10 and 98% became common. This triggered a blind race to get good marks--by hook or by crook. Cheating spread like plague. The entire system of examinations has now come under scrutiny for facilitating unrealistic demands for academic achievement. People, especially parents, instead of opposing it, have become partners. Private colleges have converted education into a purchasable commodity. Successive governments have failed to combat the menace and allowed a provisional stamp of approval to this practice. The anti-cheating law is not enough.
 
 There is no government action to promote quality literacy. Instead, they seem to be either promoting cheating or dealing with it as crime. Both approaches are complimentary and will lead nowhere. We need an approach not a law. We need to evolve better means of evaluation of knowledge.
