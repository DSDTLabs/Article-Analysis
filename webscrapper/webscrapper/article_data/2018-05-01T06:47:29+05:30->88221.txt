PANAJI: Goa police’s special investigation team (SIT) on Monday quizzed former mines minister and Margao MLA   for an hour in connection with the alleged Rs 35,000 crore mining scam.

 
  
 Summons were also issued late on Monday evening to Kamat’s son-in-law Govindraj Dempo to be present before the SIT on May 7 at 11am. “This is to probe into many suspicious shell companies, both in India and abroad, with bank accounts linked to foreign banks,” said SP (SIT) Karthik Kashyap.
 
 Kamat, who was also a former chief minister, arrived at the crime branch office at 10.30am and left at around 11.30am. A SIT officer said he was asked five questions. “If required, we will call Kamat again,” the officer said.
 
 The SIT recently filed a chargesheet before the special court against Kamat, government officials and others for allowing condonation of delay in filing application for renewal of mining leases, which resulted in a loss to the state exchequer worth Rs 135 crore.
 
 During the course of investigation, the SIT had arrested bureaucrats and iron ore traders, who were later released on bail. On July 26, 2013, the mines department had filed a complaint in the case with the crime branch, seeking that it fixes criminal liability against those involved. The department had also requested police to file an FIR against persons identified in the reports of the Supreme Court-appointed central empowered committee, the Shah Commission and the public accounts committee.
 
 “We also examined the acquisition of land at Bandekar Mines by the mines department, rather than PWD, for a proposed jetty for Anil Counto by disregarding all precedents and rules to prepare a jetty at that spot. This jetty was later on used by many fly-by-night traders who have exported illegal iron ore,” said Kashyap.
