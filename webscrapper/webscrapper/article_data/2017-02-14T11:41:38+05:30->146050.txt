CHENNAI: Justice has been upheld after 21 years, said   working president M K   on Tuesday after the   convicted   general secretary V K Sasikala in the disproportionate assets case.

 “The Supreme Court judgment against Jayalalithaa, V K Sasikala and V N Sudakaran and J Ilavarasi is historic. It is a lesson to all politicians to be clean in politics. We urge Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao to ensure a stable government is put in place at the earliest possible, given the   of Supreme Court,” Stalin said. 
 
 He said DMK would take a call when it comes to floor test keeping in mind the welfare of the people. 
 
 Manoj Pandian, a legal adviser to Jayalalithaa in many sensitive cases, said: “Truthful triumph. Sasikala betrayed Puratchi Thalaivi Amma and therefore was punished by God.”
 
 “The judgment of the trial court has been restored and majesty of justice has been upheld and it is a clear message to those people, who have criminal antecedents that they should not aspire to enter into public life. The probity in public life is a clear message from Supreme Court,” he said.
