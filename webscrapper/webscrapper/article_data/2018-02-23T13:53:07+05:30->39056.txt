PATNA: Even as the newly elected office-bearers of the   (PUSU) are likely to assume office after Holi, the PU administration has made up its mind to hold the next PUSU election in September or October this year.

 As per the new statutes for students’ union election in Bihar approved by the governor- cum- chancellor of universities in February this year, the term of newly elected students’ union will conclude with the end of current academic session in June. 
 
 “The next election will have to be conducted within six weeks of new admission in July. That is, fresh election will have to be held in September or October,” PU vice-chancellor Rash   said on Wednesday.
 
 The union to be elected in the next academic session is likely to be financially richer as it will get more funds to spend on its academic or other activities. The student union membership fee realized from students at the time of their admission has been enhanced from Rs 10 to Rs 100 from the next academic session. The fee is collected from the students at the time of their admission.
 
 According to sources, at least 12,000 students are admitted to different courses in the university every year. The amount of membership fee thus used to be around Rs1.2 lakh, which will increase to around Rs 12 lakh from the next academic session. Three-fourth of the funds thus collected will be handed over to the students’ union.
 
 Meanwhile, representatives of certain student organizations have reportedly inquired from the PU office about the status of students’ union funds collected from students all these years. The last election to PUSU was held in December 2012 and prior to that in 1984.
