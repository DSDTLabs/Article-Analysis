GHAZIABAD: The district administration has kept the   unchanged in most areas of the district for the financial year 2017-18 while making minor changes in some areas. 

 This year the determinant for the circle rates of properties has been revised with their distance from the road as the criterion. The rates vary with the width of the road in question — up to 9 metres; over 9 metres; up to 18 metres; and more than 18 metres.
 
 The new circle rates will come into effect from August 8 but before they are finalised, the administration has invited objections from the public till July 29.
 
 Elaborating on the change in the rates in the few areas, Rajesh Kumar Yadav, ADM, finance, said, “The circle rates for Red Mall on GT Road have been hiked from Rs 90,000 per sq metre to Rs 1.40 lakh per square metre while the circle rate for properties in Maliwara to Bus Stand and   to Ramteram Road has been revised from Rs 1.08 lakh to Rs 1.20 lakh per metre.”
 
 Yadav said, “Circle rates in the trans-Hindon colonies of Indirapuram, Vaishali and   are unchanged.”
 
 In addition, the rates in RDC, Raj Nagar and Sanjay Nagar have not been changed. Yadav said that given the minor change in circle rates this time around, the stamp duty collection target for 2017-18, which has been set at Rs 1761 crore, would be achieved without much of a fuss.
 
 The decision to get rid of anomalies in circle rates comes in the backdrop of the suspension of Rajesh Sharma, the additional inspector general (stamps) who was accused of running an illegal parallel office to change circle rates for personal gains. Yadav, meanwhile, said an investigation was under way into the manipulation of circle rates before August 2016 when Sharma was in office.
