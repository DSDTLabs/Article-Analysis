Gandhinagar: Incessant rains, floods and waterlogging across the state and weather forecasts about continuing heavy to very heavy rains in Saurashtra and north Gujarat has forced the state government to postpone programmes scheduled to be held in the open.

 After Monday’s review of the flood situation, Gujarat chief minister, Vijay Rupani, postponed the Narmada Mahotsav and Narmada Yatra which were to begin on July 27. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to visit the state on August 12 to participate in the event celebrating the completion of Narmada Yatra at the Narmada Dam site in Kevadia. However, in view of current developments, the PM’s visit to the state in August is likely to be rescheduled, said sources.
 
 The CM also announced postponement of his participation in the Ahmedabad heritage walk to celebrate Ahmedabad’s recognition by Unesco as a world heritage city. He said he will now attend the heritage walk on August 6.
 
 “Until now, 1,800 persons have been rescued across districts and work is still on. Three IAF helicopters, a column of army jawans and 12 teams of NDRF are working for rescue and relief operations,” Rupani told reporters.
 
  The CM told media, “We have decided to postpone Narmada Mahotsav and Narmada Yatra, as well as Ahmedabad heritage walk.”
