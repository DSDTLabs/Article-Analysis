 The EC on Wednesday asked the central bank to increase weekly withdrawal limits for candidates to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 24,000 (imposed after demonetisation) until March 11, the day on which election results will be announced. 
 
 Although candidates use cheques for a part of their poll expenses, they need cash for petty expenses, the EC explained. As well, rural areas present an especially tricky challenge, since there few or no banking facilities, the Commission added. 
 
 It reminded the central bank that candidates contesting Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab can spend upto Rs 28 lakh each for electioneering. The limit in Goa and Manipur is Rs 20 lakh.
 
 Given the current weekly withdrawal limit, a candidate will only be able to get a maximum of Rs 96,000 in cash during the three-to-four week election period, the EC said.
