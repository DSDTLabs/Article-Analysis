 PANAJI: The holy relics of   of   will be brought to Goa at the beginning of next month for a three day pilgrimage.

 The two original sacred relics— a fragment of St Anthony’s petrified flesh in a beautiful bust and his smallest rib in a casket—brought from Rome, will be kept at Monte de Guirim and Navelim for veneration. While the first relic—the petrified flesh in a bust— will be kept for public veneration, the rib in the casket will be used to bless the faithful.
 
  
  
 
 The St   Capuchin Province, Goa, jumped at the opportunity of bringing the relics to the state. During this pilgrimage in India, the relics are also being taken to Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Meghalaya.
 
 Devotees can venerate the relics on March 2 (morning to evening), and March 3 (morning to afternoon) at Alverno Friary, Monte de Guirim, and on March 3 (afternoon to evening) and on March 4 (morning to afternoon) at Padre Pio Friary, Moddi, Navelim. A detailed programme is yet to be chalked out.
 
 “St Anthony of Padua is a very popular saint in the   and for Goans too. He was a very charismatic preacher and miracle worker. Our province is dedicated to him and we hope this pilgrimage urges people to draw inspiration from his life and change their own lives,” said Fr Waldheim Rodrigues, provincial minister, St Anthony Capuchin province, Goa.
 
 The relics were brought to Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra and   in March last year. Prior to that they were taken only to Kerala in February 1996.
