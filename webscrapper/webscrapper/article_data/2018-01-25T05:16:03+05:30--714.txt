MUMBAI: In a first in the history of the   (SRA), it floated tenders on Wednesday for redevelopment of slums on a plot in village Kolekalyan of Andheri. The bidder will have to submit a bank guarantee of Rs 200 crore.

 “As per the directive of the Supreme Court, we have floated a tender for   monitored by the apex court,” SRA chief executive officer Deepak Kapoor told TOI.
  
 Elaborating on the case, Kapoor said the land belongs to Om Namo Sujalam Sufalam Cooperative Housing Society.
 
 Susme builders had submitted the scheme for redevelopment of slums. However, its appointment was later terminated. The decision was contested before a high power committee, Bombay High Court and Supreme Court too.
 
 Subsequently, JG Developers was appointed as the new developer to implement the scheme for and on behalf of the society.
 
 On January 4, the Supreme Court asked SRA to invite letters of intent from renowned builders and developers, who have the capacity and experience to take up such large projects.
 
 The SC’s condition on Rs200-crore bank guarantee is to ensure slum dwellers are not taken for a ride.
 
 “In case of violation of terms and conditions of the rehabilitation scheme without reasonable cause, the SRA will be entitled to invoke the bank guarantee. Further, the apex court has directed that the developer must complete rehabilitation of slum dwellers within two years,” Kapoor said.
 
 Kapoor said the unique feature of the scheme is the society of slum dwellers is also the owner of the land and the apex court has considered the rights of slum dwellers to have additional benefits as against their right of ownership.
 
 A senior bureaucrat said in view of the apex court order, the SRA should bring in drastic changes in its present approach to slum redevelopment. “In my opinion, SRA should accept the system of floating tenders for all slum redevelopment schemes to bring in complete transparency in the process,’’ he said.
