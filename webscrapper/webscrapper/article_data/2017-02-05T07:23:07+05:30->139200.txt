CHENNAI: Faced with a shortage of space to set up industries, the State   (SIPCOT) is eyeing an addition of 50,000 acres to its land bank, including areas on Chennai's peripheries.

 At a leadership session on “Progressive Chennai: Advancing Success in an Evolving Market“ organised by   and JLL on Saturday, industries department secretary Vikram Kapur said SIPCOT had allocated 20,000 acres of the available 24,000 acres to industries. “Land has been the biggest constraint and most of the land provided through SIPCOT has already been occupied. We are continuously expanding our land bank and the target is to develop an additional land bank of 50,000 acres, some of which will come from Chennai and peri-urban areas,“ he said.
 
 In a bid to spur industrial growth across the state, the government is developing two major corridors including the   corridor. The proposed industrial corridor will for the first time comprise nodes with exclusive planning authority and special purpose vehicles to provide necessary infrastructure. “It is a new approach where, rather than industries running to various agencies, we will be creating a mechanism for all planning approvals such as masterplans and these will be given by a dedicated authority ,“ he said. The state is also foraying into the sunrise sector of aerospace and defence manufacturing and an aerospace park would soon be established at Sriperumbudur near the city for the purpose, he added.
 
 The industries secretary further said that the state till date had realised `25,000 crore of the   till that had been proposed during the Global Investors Meet (GIM) held in Chennai in September 2015.
 
 Noting that various industries had made an investment commitment of more than `2 lakh crore at the GIM, he said investments had been made at a rate of 10% of the proposed figure, higher than the usual range of 2%-5%.
