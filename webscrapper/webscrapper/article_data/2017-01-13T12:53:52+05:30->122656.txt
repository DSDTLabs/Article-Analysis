PANAJI: “It’s not everyday that you shake hands with the prime minister of your birthplace in his homeland,” Portuguese-born Brazilian mediator Nazareth Serpa said, moments after stopping Portuguese Prime Minister   in his tracks and   for a brief discussion on the meaning of the Portuguese word ‘Obrigado’ (Thank you). 

 Serpa is among 30 mediation professionals attending Lex Infinitum 2017, an international dispute resolution competition, held at V M Salgaocar College of Law, Miramar. 
 
  The personal touch Costa attached to his entry into the conference room of the   campus on Thursday evening was much appreciated by the attendees, as he looked each person, standing along the aisle, in the eye and greeted them. 
 
 He spoke on how the rich cultural heritage of Goa makes it a unique melting point for the east and west. “The Goan legal system, being a symbiosis of Indian and Portuguese legislations, has in a way endured the relationship between the two countries and the Portuguese government is committed to contributing to education in India,” Costa said. 
 
 A capacity crowd of mediation enthusiasts waited with bated breath for Costa’s arrival, but most of them were left high and dry when the Portuguese premier didn’t address any subjects relating to conflict management and resolution.
 
   , an attorney and mediator who shuttles between Rio de Janeiro and Miami, said, “I liked that he spoke about dialogue to facilitate better relationships between India and Portugal, but was disappointed he didn’t touch on the possibilities of alternative dispute resolution, considering he spoke about trade and business, and we are at a mediation event focussed on commecial disputes.”
