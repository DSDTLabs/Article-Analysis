 “The EC actually waits for Modi's speech in Lucknow to announce the dates (for polls)... their inde pendence is under question,“ he said during an exclusive interview with TOI on Sunday .
 
 He is in Goa for three days in the final leg of his election tour.AAP is jostling for power in two of the five states going to polls on February 4: Punjab and Goa. “Do you believe it's a coincidence?.. They actually wanted to keep us engaged here (in Goa),“ he said.
 
 “Actually, during Modi's tenure, he has compromised most institutions. RBI... CBI...CIC have become a joke. One of the information commissioners said show Modi's degrees and he was transferred... (With the) new charge he got, he said show Smriti Irani's degrees, again he was transferred. Is this the way you run a govern ment?“ the AAP chief asked.
 
 Kejriwal said if in Delhi, CBI is questioning deputy CM Sisodia, in Goa ,the anti-corruption branch interrogated its CM candidate Elvis Gomes.
 
 “It's all political victimisation... When Modiji came to power... he used to abuse Vadra and Congressmen. He never said a word against AAP. But in the past two and a half years, he has not arrested them, but our 20 MLAs have been arrested.“
