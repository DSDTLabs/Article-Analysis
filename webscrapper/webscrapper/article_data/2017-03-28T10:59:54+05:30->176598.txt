CHENNAI: A man who claimed to be former   chief minister 
  and audaciously moved the Madras high court seeking to be declared her son, besides protection for himself, is now facing arrest. 

 He even furnished a copy of a 'will' signed by his 'parents'   and Telugu actor Shoban Babu. 
 
 Citing a police report, Justice R Mahadevan lambasted the man, J Krishnamoorthy. He directed police to take appropriate action against him. 
 
 "The inspector of police, CCB ( Central Crime Branch), submitted a report in a sealed cover. The petitioner, who is son of Krishnamurthy and Vasanthamani and not the alleged son as falsely claimed by him. It is also alleged that old stamp papers were purchased from one Subramanian, a stamp vendor and fabricated and the name of former chief minister was written as Komalavalli alias Jayalalithaa. Only with an ulterior motive that the petitioner came to this court. The report filed by police is placed on record. Police are directed to secure the person connected thereto and proceed in accordance with law and report before this court on April 10, 2017," the CCB report said. 
 
 “He has not only cheated the court but also prepared forged documents,” said the judge and asked the police to take appropriate action against him in accordance with law. 
 
 When Krishmoorthy moved the petition more than a week ago, the judge flayed him in open court and directed him to hand over the document to the Chennai city commissioner of police for examination. 
 
 As per the direction, the Central Crime Branch scrutinised the document which had photographs of Jayalalithaa and Shoban Babu, besides signature of former chief minister and Jayalalithaa's mentor M G Ramachandran. 
 
 Inspector of police, the Central Crime Branch, submitted in a sealed cover which apparently identified his parents in Tiruppur as his biological parents and dismissed his Jaya son theory comprehensively.
