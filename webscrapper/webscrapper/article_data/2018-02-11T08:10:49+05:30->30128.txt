JODHPUR: Recruitment of teachers in   (JNVU) is again under fire, this time from its own syndicate members. Some of the members have upped the ante against vice chancellor seeking clarifications about the ongoing recruitment drive.

 Alleging lack of transparency in the recruitment of assistant professors and irregularities, the members, including two MLAs Pabbaram Bishnoi from Phalodi and   from  , have sent a questionnaire to V-C R P Singh and refused to be part of the recruitment process unless the answers were provided before interviews start.
 
 The questionnaire included queries pertaining to the legitimacy of authorities involved in the selections process, irregularities in written examination, absence of decisions of syndicate meeting in minutes, vacancy notification published only in the UP edition of a specific newspaper, OMR sheets and avoiding posting of the merit list of candidates on university website.
 
 “We are highly disappointed that the entire selection process lacks transparency, which indicates that the merit of the applicants stands highly compromised,” said Garg, adding that they will not be endorsing the selection process.Bishnoi said that they expect justified answers to all the questions raised by them from the V-C before the interview process starts. “Otherwise, it would not be possible for us to be part of this recruitment process in the interest of good education system and all the educationists and others would be forced to adopt legitimate democratic steps to avoid the selection process,” he said.
 
 V-C R P Singh, however, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
