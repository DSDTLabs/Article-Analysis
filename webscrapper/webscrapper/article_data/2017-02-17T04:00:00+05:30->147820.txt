Mumbai: Days after activist investor   got   to do a big   and change board composition, Wipro’s chief strategy officer   said there should be clear communication with shareholders on investment plans to avoid any activism. 

 “I think we really give much less credit to investors. If you are able to communicate very clearly to investors about the journey and path you are on, they can be patient with you,” said   at the Nasscom India Leadership Forum in Mumbai on Thursday. Last year,   approved a buyback up to 4 crore equity shares at Rs 625 per share, with an aggregate amount not exceeding Rs 2,500 crore or $377 million.
 
 With reference to the massive technology changes that are buffeting the IT industry, Premji said: “If there is ever a time for the companies in the IT services industry to be bold it’s now. The uncertainty around the US elections, the Brexit and you have shareholder activism on top of that. We are in a whole different level of complexities, fundamental change is happening in the industry. There is a need for organisations to design themselves to deal with such complexities.” Premji said the thing companies worry about most is that they see the change happening but cannot make the pivot fast enough. “Certainly there is more price competitiveness, but I still think there is lot of runway and opportunity for how you deliver with automation, and how you play a differentiated story. It will certainly depend on the big bold bets you take,” said Premji.
 
 Asked how companies incentivise employees in the stable business while living the excitement on the newer ones, Premji said, it’s important not to create the poor cousin feeling in the stable business. “The reality is — that’s the cash cow that will fund your future. Teams shouldn’t be looking down upon the old and that’s very important,” he added.
