VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh doctors stayed away from services, on Thursday, in protest of Andhra Pradesh Allopathic Private Medical Care Establishments (APMCE) Act-2018.

 Doctors wore black badges and raised slogans against the government.   (IMA),  , which was leading the agitation said 70 per cent of medical practitioners in the state are operating their own clinics and small-scale hospitals and the new bill will jeopardise their operations. Speaking to TOI,   state president   said it is not mandatory for the state government to implement the APMCE Act, which is meant for north-eastern states and union territories.
 
 The preamble of the national bill clearly says the states shall join this act with their own will and there is no compulsion, he added. “We have represented our case in front of former health minister   and chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu at least nine times. The committee, constituted by Kamineni Srinivas under the leadership of former IAS officer Dr  , studied the bill and recommended the state to not implement the bill in the state as Andhra Pradesh Allopathic Private Medical Care Establishments Act-2002 is doing a decent job of regulating private clinics in the state,”said IMA joint secretary Dr P Phanidhar.
