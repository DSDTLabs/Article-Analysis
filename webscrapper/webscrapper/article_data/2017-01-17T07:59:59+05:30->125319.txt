CHENNAI: An initiative to reduce pollution and save fuel, the   (PCRA) will train more than 7,000 drivers of the state transport corporation this year.
A pilot project was launched in the   of the  . It will soon be extended to other places in the city and eventually to other districts.
 
 “We have been asked to train drivers in the state, particularly from state transport corporations, on saving fuel and controlling pollution,“ PCRA southern region chief coordination A Janakiram told TOI on the sidelines of `Saksham 2017', a month-long oil and gas conservation mass awareness campaign inaugurated on Monday .
 
 The drivers will be selected by officials of the depots to which they are attached. “At the transport department training centre, we will make the selected drivers drive a bus or truck and note the fuel consumption and mileage details. After that we will teach them nuances of saving fuel like operation of clutch, gears, use of accelerators,“ said Janakiram.
 
 The PCRA trainers will record data on the driver's per formance before and after training and compare it.“We have noticed that after training the driver is able to reduce fuel consumption by 14% at the training spot. But in real time conditions the fuel consumption comes down by 5%,“ said Janakiram.
 
 The T Nagar depot was chosen for the pilot project as some of its buses travelled long distances on rugged routes. “We have a faculty of 30 members who will be training the drivers. There are more than 100 drivers in the depot and we will be training them for a day,“ said Janakiram.
 
 School children, home makers and others will be involved in creating awareness on fuel conservation during `Saksham 2017', inaugurated at the   regional headquarters by state transport secretary Chandrakanth B Kamble. The annual campaign in earlier years used to be for a week.
