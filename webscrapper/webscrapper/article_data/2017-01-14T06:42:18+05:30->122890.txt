AYODHYA: The chief priest of the disputed   has laid down a condition for supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party in the coming elections. 

 Speaking from his residence on Friday, chief priest Acharya Satyendra Das urged Prime Minister   to visit Ayodhya and assure the sadhus that he would get the temple constructed there. 
 
 “After the Modi government took charge, we got hopeful that the mandir would be constructed. Modi must give us a guarantee of trust that he would get the mandir built during his tenure,” said Das.
 
 “Then we will mobilize Hindus to vote for the   as mahants and sadhus in Uttar Pradesh enjoy a following among devotees. If we support the BJP, it will definitely win.”
 
 Reacting to the chief priest’s demand for Ram mandir, the mahant of Rasik Niwas temple, Raghuvar Sharan pointed out, “Many BJP leaders, rose in stature by raising the temple issue. LK Advani , Murli  , Vinay Katiyar, Uma Bharti, to name a few of them, all are MPs but they never spoke in favour of the temple in the House. They didn’t ask the PM to bring a resolution in Parliament for the construction of the temple.”
