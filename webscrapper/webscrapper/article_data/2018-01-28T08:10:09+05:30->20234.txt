BENGALURU: While uploading the video in question brought to light brutality against a minor, the shop owner's act must been seen as an encroachment of privacy, according to experts.

 "This may seem like a good cause, it is. But the man had no right to view videos or check other details on the phone that wasn't his," one expert said.
 
 "The information stored in a smartphone is more valuable than the actual device, given that bank information, photos, contacts and email account give anyone access to everything they need to know about you to steal your identity. It's not just smartphone theft that puts your personal information at risk. If your phone breaks and you take it to a repair shop you may also be at risk," said cybercrime expert and advocate  .
 
 He pointed out that it is important for the customer to know who is fixing their phone and be able to watch the process take place, he said. "If repairs are conducted in a back room there is always the chance someone will access your private information or photos while fixing your phone," he said, adding that an agreement between repairing shop and the consumer regarding data safety and its theft must become a practice. 
 
 Normally, repair shop owners just have one clause in their agreement: "Any data or information that you may have stored on the equipment shall remain your sole responsibility and we accept no liability for loss or corruption of such data howsoever caused. It is your responsibility to keep a record of any such data" 
 
 However, there is no clause regarding the privacy of the customer's personal data is such agreements.
