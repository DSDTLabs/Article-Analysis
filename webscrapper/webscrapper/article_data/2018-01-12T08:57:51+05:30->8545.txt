GUWAHATI: Amid growing popular demand for deferment of the Nagaland assembly election, the   has gone ahead and published the final electoral rolls, setting the stage for polls due next month. 

 The   is yet to announce the poll schedule for three northeastern states - Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura - assembly terms of which expire by the second week of March. Nagaland chief electoral officer Abhijit   said the final rolls have fewer names than those published before the last assembly election. This time, there are 11,89,264 voters registered in Nagaland, down from 11,92,377 in 2013. "The decline in numbers is due to cleansing of multiple entries in the electoral rolls," Sinha added. Till October last year, 11,63,388 voters had been registered in the draft rolls and a last-minute enrolment drive saw the inclusion of 25,876 additional names. 
 
 The demand to postpone assembly election in the state until the "Naga political issue" is resolved has been gaining ground for some time now. The Union home ministry, however, has taken a firm stand on the matter and said election has to be conducted as per schedule. "HM also told the Nagaland chief minister that announcing the dates for assembly elections is the prerogative of the election Commission and the elections have to be held on schedule. Any reports to the contrary are incorrect," the home ministry tweeted.
