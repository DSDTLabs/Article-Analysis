 who will sit for   on March 5, the first mandatory public exam after eight years, “need to secure overall 33% (both internal assessment and the Board exam marks taken together) in the subject to be able to pass”. They will be exempted from the mandatory separate pass criteria in subjects having internal assessment component of 20 marks and 80 marks of Board examination.

 The Central Board of Secondary Education on Tuesday notified this one-time exemption.
 
 The CBSE had introduced the Comprehensive and Continuous Evaluation (CCE) scheme along with optional Board exam. All others took the school-based exam. The CCE system was revoked in 2017 and Class X Board examination was made mandatory.
 
 According to the notification issued by CBSE chairperson Anita Karwal, the examination committee recently decided to give the one-time exemption to the Class X students as they will be the first batch after the Board exam made a comeback. The same passing criteria will also apply in the additional subjects, provided they have internal assessment of 20 marks and Board examination of 80 marks.
 
 This rule will also apply for students with subjects under National Skills Qualifications Framework scheme for the five major subjects —two languages, science, mathematics and social science. The provision of replacement of subjects extended to the   “for the failed subjects (out of the three subjects – science, mathematics and social science) by the vocational subject (passed by the candidate under NSQF) would continue to apply”. However, for vocational subjects listed in Annexure I, which were notified on March 9, 2017, there will be no exemption from separate pass criteria as the internal assessment component of these subjects comprise 50 marks. In these subjects, mandatory separate pass criteria of securing 33% both in internal as well as Board examination will apply.
