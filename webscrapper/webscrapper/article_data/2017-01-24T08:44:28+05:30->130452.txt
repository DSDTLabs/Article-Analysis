JAIPUR: It’s a book about two decades old.   said at the   (JLF) on Monday that he himself had quite forgotten about the narrative. Invited to make a presentation on ‘Nathaniel’s Nutmeg’ at JLF, he   about wars between nations over nutmeg.

 This reporter has seen nutmeg grown in Kerala, but only on Monday did one realize that the spice was at the centre of so much bloodshed a few centuries ago.
 
 Milton took his audience through the story of Nathaniel Courthope, an employee of the English East India Company, who bravely fought a large contingent of Dutch troops in the early 17th century to hold on to Run Island, off the coast of Indonesia, one of 10 islands in Banda Sea from where nutmeg was sourced by Europeans.
 
 Through interesting maps and slides, Milton showed images of the kinds of torture that men were subjected to in the race for control over nutmeg.
 
 He spoke of records maintained by the East India Company, which preserved diaries of its employees and even letters, which became a rich resource for historians trying to understand the period. Wading through these documents, historian-novelist William Dalrymple said it was no easy task as the script was very different from modern English and could take a while to decipher.
 
 What was especially interesting was this little known fact that Milton explained as postscript to his presentation – the English, by the 1667 Treaty of Breda, agreed to give up control over the island of Run to the Dutch in return for Manhattan – yes, that densely populated part of New York, the heart of Big Apple!
