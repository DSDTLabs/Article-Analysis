Salem: A 39-year-old auto driver, who consumed rat poison on Saturday in protest against the central government’s failure to constitute the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) by the timeframe stipulated by the Supreme Court, died at the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital here on Wednesday.

 The deceased was identified as K Prabhu, of Housing Board area at Maniyanur in the city. He is survived by his wife P Sumathi and two children.
 
 According to the Shevapet police, Prabhu had earlier served as the district member of an outfit named Revolutionary Marxist Party of India.
 
 Prabhu, the police said, consumed rat poison at the Shevapet auto stand. “Fellow auto drivers suddenly rushed him to the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College hospital, where he died without responding to the treatment,” the police added.
 
 Prabhu in his dying declaration said he had taken the extreme decision over the central government’s failure to pay heed to the Supreme Court’s February 16 verdict to form the CMB within six weeks of time. “He told us that he wanted to sacrifice his life for the people of Tamil Nadu. He had earlier recorded a video of himself saying the same things and uploaded on WhatsApp and Facebook,” the police said.
