AHMEDABAD: Thirty eight post-graduate students of   have not been paying fees for last more than a year following a dispute over   claiming that the term   of Rs 8.97 lakh is too high.

 The issue came to Gujarat high court after the college and the   (SMC) issued notices terminating their residency for not paying fees. The students, who are resident doctors too, rushed to the court, which has asked them to pay Rs seven lakh of total Rs 15.16 lakh dues by June 15. The court will decide deadline for payment of next instalment on June 15. Till then it has said that the authorities should not take any action against the students.
 
 The problem started in May 2015 when the   allowed the college to give admission on basis of fee structure prevailing during the previous year. The committee was to revise the fee structure in July-August and admission in PG courses took place before that.
 
 After the students took admission by paying amount as per the existing fee structure, the Fee Regulation Committee fixed it at Rs 8.97 lakh, which was not acceptable to the students. They challenged the fee revision before the high court and did not pay fees for next two semesters.
 
 Meanwhile, the college authorities issued them termination notice. But they approached the HC for stay. 
 
 During the hearing, SMCâ€™s advocate Kaushal Pandya argued that most of the students are getting stipend of Rs 42,000 per month while some others get various scholarships. The college spends nearly Rs 20 lakh per student per year whic is public money. It was also argued that the students have completed four semesters and after completion of two more semesters, they would be out of the college. This would be almost impossible to recover the money from them in such eventuality.
