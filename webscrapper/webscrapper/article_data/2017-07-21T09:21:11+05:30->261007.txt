 The work on the stretch between AG-DMS and Saidapet is nearing completion. It is part of the airportCentral-Washermenpet line of which Little Mount-Washermenpet stretch is yet to be opened.
 
 While officials earlier planned to open the entire Anna Salai stretch at one go by mid-2018, the beginning of trial runs indicates that it may be opened much before the deadline.Officials said a locomotive was operated on the 4km line from Little Mount and AG-DMS.Round the clock work is underway on the up-line. While the line between AGDMS and Saidapet is underground, Saidapet connects to Little Mount elevated station through a ramp built across the Adyar river. “Subsequent trial runs with metro trains on the stretch will start after the completion of system works,“ a release from CMRL said.
 
 Installation of various critical systems like tunnel ventilation, heatingventilation and airconditioning system (HVAC), signaling, platform screen doors, automatic fare collection (AFC) gates are complete. Last leg of work is underway at the AG-DMS, Tey nampet, Nandanam and Saidapet stations.
 
 The 4km line was part of the stretch on Anna Salai where work was stalled for more than a year after a Russian contractor abandoned construction midway citing a financial crisis.
 
 Now, while the line between AGDMS and Saidapet is ready , tunneling is still underway between May Day Park and AG-DMS. Tunnel boring machines are excavating soil and building tunnels near the Anna flyover close to AGDMS station. Officials are expecting to complete tunneling in the next couple of months.
 
 Once the entire stretch is open, metro trains are expected to decongest the arterial Anna Salai.
