CHENNAI: The DMK has criticised the AIADMK government for not appealing against the order of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on opening of   schools in Tamil Nadu.

 The high court had asked the state government on Monday to allow the opening of Navodaya schools in the state. 
 
 In a statement on Thursday, DMK working president M K   demanded that the government appeal against the HC order and prevent opening of Navodaya schools in the state.
 
 “The state government appealed against the high court order on waiver of all farmer loans. However, the government has not appealed against the court’s order on Navodaya schools,” Stalin said.
 
 He said introduction of Navodaya schools in Tamil Nadu is an attempt to impose Hindi in the state. “The headquarters of such schools is situated in   and all communications to and from the headquarters must be in Hindi,” he said.
 
 “As Hindi is a must in communications and curriculum, no teacher from Tamil Nadu will be appointed in such schools,” Stalin charged.
