PATNA: A day after the   president and joint secretary were forwarded to jail after their arrest for drinking liquor despite prohibition in the state, police SI   was arrested from his   in   district after he was found in an inebriated condition on Friday morning.
 
  Bihar Police Men’s Association president   and joint secretary Shamsher Khan were arrested by the Patna police in an inebriated condition from the New Police Line in Patna on Wednesday night.
  
  Sources said the SI had consumed one of the liquor bottles seized by his subordinates earlier on Thursday. He was arrested after Muzaffarpur IG Sunil Kumar, Muzaffarpur SSP Vivek Kumar and DSP (Town) Ashish Anand were tipped off about the SI’s inebriated state after midnight on Thursday.
  
  SHO Mithilesh Kumar Jha was not in the police station as he has been on leave since May 3. “A high-voltage drama preceded the arrest as the SI fled from the police station premises on learning about the movement of senior officers. He could be caught after around an hour and was subjected to breathalyser test,” a source said, preferring anonymity.
  
  Earlier on Thursday morning, the Kazimohammadpur police nabbed one Ravi Shankar Thakur and recovered 48 bottles of Haryana-manufactured IMFL from him, near Mukti Nath Nagar. “Ravi was carrying the consignment in a two-wheeler which was intercepted by ASI Pramod Kumar Singh and brought to the police station,” the source said.
  
  A native of Bhojpur district, the SI was forwarded to jail on Friday after an FIR was lodged against him on a written complaint of ASI Ramashish Singh.
