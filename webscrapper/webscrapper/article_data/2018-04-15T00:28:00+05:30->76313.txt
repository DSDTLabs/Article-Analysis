Coimbatore: A 100 metre-long bridge across the Noyyal river at Semmedu, the works on which started some six months ago at a cost of Rs 3.2 crore, is likely to take another year for completion.  The bridge, an engineer at the construction site told TOI, would connect Thombipalayam to Boluvampatti in times of flood. Pointing out that the river often overflows during monsoon, the engineer said, “As such residents find it difficult to cross the river. There is an existing mud road, but that also gets submerged during the rain. The bridge will be of great help to the residents.”  The bridge would be 100m long and 6.5m high. It would have six piers and five spans.  “During monsoon, it becomes very difficult for us to cross the bridge. There are several farms and residential localities in the area. Once the bridge is ready, it will be easier for us to reach Poluvampatti,” said a resident.  Another resident in the area, Siva Kumar, said the construction was going at a snail’s pace. “Monsoon will set in June. If they keep delaying it, it will serve no purpose,” he said.  Presently, Noyyal riverbed has become a hotspot for sand smuggling. “Every night, sand is smuggled from the area. We have dug up huge pits to lay foundations for the bridge. Locals dig up areas close to these and smuggle sand. Others may think that we have dug up the river for construction purpose,” said a worker at the construction site.
