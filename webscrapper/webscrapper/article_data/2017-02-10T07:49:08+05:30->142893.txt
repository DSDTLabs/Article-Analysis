COIMBATORE: Former mayor of the Coimbatore city municipal corporation P Rajkumar has extended his unconditional support to caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam. 

 “We are supporting O Panneerselvam. Many ward secretaries of   urban district unit are also supporting OPS. The people of the state and cadre of   wanted the government under chief minister O Panneerselvam to continue,” Rajkumar told TOI on Thursday.
 
 He said that he had spoken with a few MLAs who hailed from western Tamil Nadu. “They are also supporting the chief minister. But the MLAs are kept under wrongful confinement in Chennai. All the MLAs have to be rescued by the state government. MLAs were elected by the people of the state. So, they have to work for people,” said Rajkumar.
 
 OPS is the right person for chief minister post as he was appointed twice by former  , Rajkumar said.
 
 “We want the chief minister to take over the Kodanadu estate and Kodanadu bungalow and declare them for public use. It was earned by Amma (Jayalalithaa). So, after her demise, the properties should go for public use and Sasikala should not enjoy the property,” he said.
 
 As per the AIADMK bylaw, party’s general secretary should be selected by all the cadres of the party. But Sasikala violated the bylaw of the party and became the general secretary. So, party cadres won’t accept her as general secretary, he added.
 
 “Common people are raising many questions over the death of Amma. So, all the questions should be answered by Sasikala. Former chief minister Amma was surrounded by many corrupted ministers who earned for themselves only. They did not take any issues to Amma. These ministers wanted to rule the state for four years. Then only they can swindle crores of rupees. I have the names of corrupt ministers and not ready to reveal it now,” said Rajkumar, who will meet OPS in a couple of days along with his supporters.
