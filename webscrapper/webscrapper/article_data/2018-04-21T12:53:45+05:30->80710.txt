MADURAI: Seeking police permission and protection for holding protest against India-based neutrino observatory in Theni district, R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran’s supporter Thanga Tamil   has filed a plea. 

 When the case came up for admission before the division bench of justices C T   and A M Basheer Ahamed, the petitioner’s counsel said that Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) had decided to hold an agitation on May 4 at   in Theni to support the public voice against the installation of the neutrino observatory. 
 
 For that, the petitioner sent a representation to the Bodi taluk police inspector and the Theni SP on April 12. But, the SP rejected it on April 14. Besides, the police said that the agitation is unwarranted because the TNPCB and the forest department did not grant any permission for the project. But, the central government allowed the research unit to use 3.4 lakh litre of water from the Periyar dam. It shows the government is keen on commencing work on a war-footing. 
 
 Several political parties, organisations and public have been opposing the neutrino project by conducting protests, meetings and rallies, for whom the police had given permission. But, the police denied permission for the petitioner only. They should have not rejected the petitioner’s request. 
 
 Subsequently, the petitioner gave another representation to the police to hold public meeting on May 6. tnn
