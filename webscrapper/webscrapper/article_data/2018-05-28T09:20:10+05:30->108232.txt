 SP (north) Anurag Vats said, "We had been getting regular complaints from morning walkers about youths performing dangerous stunts on roads near Samtamulak crossing and Riverfront. The stunts endangered the life of morning walkers as well as of the riders.
 
 Gomtinagar SHO Jitendra Singh said controlling stunt biking had become a challenge for police. 
 
 "The bikers put their own lives at risk and can cause harm to morning walkers and commuters. We were given instructions to curb the menace, so we asked our informers for tip-offs," he said.
 
 The youths were doing a 'wheelie' and racing dangerously, he added. 
 
 "We will initiate further action like cancelling driving licences if needed," Singh added.
