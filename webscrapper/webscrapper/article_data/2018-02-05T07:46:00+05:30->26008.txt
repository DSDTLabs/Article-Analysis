Ludhiana: The   at the Kila Raipur sports ground has become a victim of apathy of the authorities, as it has now turned into a storage godown, in which useless banners and hoardings are stored, to keep them safe from the vagaries of weather. Constructed at a cost of more than Rs 25 lakh in 2002 by the then state sports ministry with an aim of reviving the sports culture in Kila Raipur village, it has not been used for the past ten years.

 More importantly, even players living in the village do not know that their village has its own indoor stadium, constructed to promote table tennis, boxing, and weightlifting in the rural areas. Local player Rajbir Singh stated: “From the time I started practising sports, I haven’t seen any tournament conducted in this indoor stadium. It was only used for storing banners and hoardings.”
 
 Meanwhile, sources claimed that Kila Raipur village was famous for hockey and traditional games, so it was a total waste of funds to build an indoor stadium here, as most players prefer to play outdoor sports. Member of the Kila Raipur Sports Association, Jagbir Grewal, claimed: “Kila Raipur Sports Association, along with sports department officials, would take some decision in this regard, and make appropriate efforts to bring them to use for village players who want to play indoor games in the village.”
 
 Alexi Grewal, an American Olympic gold medallist in cycling, visited Kila Raipur on the second day of the games. He told mediapersons: “India has the potential to prepare Olympic-level players, but the country needs to develop a cycling nursery to produce a good cyclist. Cyclists in India are required to be trained from the grassroot level. The Indian government should work to encourage cyclists. I came to know about these games six years ago. But I was very disappointed with the banning of bullock cart races. I personally request the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to re-start the event and preserve Indian village culture.”
