Teen sensation   showed why he is one of the hottest properties in world   as he pummelled   in straight sets to help Canada clinch the   playoff tie against India and return to the World Group in Edmonton on Sunday. For the record, 18-year-old Shapovalov defeated Ramanathan 6-3, 7-6(1), 6-3 in the first reverse singles before Yuki Bhambri beat home debutant Brayden Schnur 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in the dead fifth rubber as Canada avoided relegation with a 3-2 win.
And, for the record, India stay in AsiaOceania Zone Group I, having faltered at the playoff stage for the fourth time in a row.
 
 But Sunday was not merely about the record. This tie was as much about Canada as it was about India: a new tennis powerhouse in the making against a nation rich in tennis tradition but struggling to make it to the top.
 
 Consider this. Canada were without World No. 11Milos Raonic. Apart from Shapo valov creating ripples with his exploits in the last few months, they have a 17-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime (No. 161) who has become the youngest to break into the top-200 since Rafael Nadal and Richard Gasquet in 2002.Then they have the seasoned Vasek Pospisil (No. 81) and Peter Polansky (128). And Schnur (208) is just 22. Sunday gave proof as to why Shapovalov is considered a revelation not just back home in Canada but across the globe.
