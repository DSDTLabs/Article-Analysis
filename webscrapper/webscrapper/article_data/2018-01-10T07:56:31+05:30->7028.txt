CUTTACK: Again an   comes back to haunt   Infighting within the party came to the fore after a few   in Nischintakoili block in Cuttack district opposed inauguration of the overhead water tank by Panda scheduled for January 11. 

 The water tank in Buhalo gram panchayat in Nischintakoili has been constructed from Panda's MPLAD fund. 
 
 A group of BJD leaders alleged that local leaders have not been invited to the programme. The MP's office refuted the allegations. "Local leaders have been invited to the programme. Some people are upset because they have not been able to collect percentage from the project as MPLAD fund is out of their control," said a press release issued by the MP's office. 
 
  In May last year, Panda was attacked with eggs and shoes at Mahanga by BJD supporters when he had gone to inaugurate a similar project in the block. 
 
 In a related development, sarpanch of Buhalo gram panchayat Sarojini Das on Tuesday wrote a letter to the Cuttack collector, seeking cooperation during the scheduled inauguration of the overhead water tank by the MP, following threats.
