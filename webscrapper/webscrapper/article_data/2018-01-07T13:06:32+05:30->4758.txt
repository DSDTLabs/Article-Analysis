HUBBALLI: The   (HDMC) has launched a drive to end the menace of   which has caused huge panic among citizens. Following pressure from citizens, the   has started the process of shifting stray dogs from the city. 

 After resolving technical issues, the HDMC started the drive of sterilization of stray dogs with the help of an NGO in October. The drive fizzled out due to injury to dog catchers. However, the NGO decided to speed up the drive after increasing complaints. Now, they have decided to catch 20 dogs in the morning and 10 in the evening.
 
 Dr Ravi Saligoudar, officer of the HDMC health department, said that gradually, the civic body is attending to complaints on a regular basis. “Even the NGO is working hard. Due to some dog bite incidents, the number of dog catchers is less. But the injured catchers will be back on job after recovery,” he added.
 
 Ashalata Patil, a resident of Anand Nagar, said, “We complained to the HDMC, but they initiate action once in 15 days and sometimes once in a month. It’s difficult to walk on roads in the evening,” she said.
 
 Subramanyam Naidu, a resident of Gokul Road, said that he suspects the HDMC drops dogs at   after picking them from other parts of the city. “This is why they are reluctant to attend to complaints. If this negligent attitude continuous, then it would be very difficult to go outside for elderly people and children,” he said.
