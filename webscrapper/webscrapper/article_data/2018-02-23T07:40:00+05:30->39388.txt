Dharamshala: Teams of language and culture department, tourism officials and representatives of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will visit the Haripur-Guler area to inspect the site claimed as heritage property by some native villagers and their leaders. The visit is scheduled for Friday. The TOI had carried the story last week after which the teams were constituted for the purpose. 

 It was this month when villagers collaborated to clean up a well to make it a source of water during summer. They started clearing silt from it and later discovered a gallery, a room and stairs inside it. They claimed it an architecture marvel from the past. Residents of the area made strong claims that their place was located adjacent to the heritage village (Garli-Paragpur), where many historical monuments are also located. They said this was ruled by Guler Riyasat and Kangra miniature paintings evolved from this place.
 
 District tourism director Madhu Choudhary said the teams were supposed to visit the spot on Friday. “Officials from our department will too accompany them,” she said. Rajkumar Saklani, a senior official of language and culture department, too confirmed the move. “The main purpose to visit this spot is to verify the fact of the villagers,” he said.
 
 Haripur Heritage Development Society stated that they had been demanding that this place should be considered for heritage tourism for quite some time. “According to historians, this place was developed between 1398 and 1405 by Raja Harichand. His state was known as Guler Riyasat,” said Surinder Dhiman, president of the society.
 
 Raghav Guleria, a local resident, stated that there were about 300 temples and other such type of monuments in the area but these have never been considered for heritage tourism. “Historical monuments are being destroyed due to improper upkeep,” he added.
