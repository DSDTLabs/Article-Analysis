LUCKNOW: The   on Friday cancelled the   granted to ex-minister   and his two aides, Vikas Verma and Amrendra singh alias Pinto, in connection with a gang  . They had been granted bail by the additional sessions court on April 25, but the high court had put a stay on it. 

 The high court, however, said the accused can move fresh pleas for bail.
 
 Allowing the petition of the state government seeking cancellation of bail granted to Gayatri and his aides, Justice AP Sahi pointed out the manner of hearing of the bail pleas by the additional session judge. “The entire episode indicates that the manner in which the bail was granted almost on the eve of the retirement of the officer concerned, that too even without any opportunity being afforded to the prosecution in real sense, grant of bail was vitiated.”
 
 Gayatri, a former SP minister, and his aides were arrested on March 15 on charges of gang-raping a woman and attempting to rape her daughter. The FIR was registered after Supreme Court had rapped UP government.
