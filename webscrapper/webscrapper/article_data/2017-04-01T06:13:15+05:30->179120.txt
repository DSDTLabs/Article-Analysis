NEW DELHI: More relief is in store for people flying out of India’s seven biggest   — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Cochin.

 They may soon not need “security checked” stamps on their boarding pass, just like this practice is being done away for hand bag tags from April 1. These airports handle around 80% of air traffic in India by passenger volume.
 
 The Central Industrial Security Force ( ) originally wanted stamping of boarding cards to end when biometric identification starts getting used for passenger boarding process. However, now it feels the same can happen at the seven airports without waiting that long. For passengers, it will mean e-boarding cards after e-tickets — a paperless boarding experience.
 
 “There is no hard and fast rule. We can remove stamping for boarding cards too at these seven airports,” CISF chief O P Singh said, adding, “We are in constant touch with airlines and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security to start using biometric identification for flyers at the earliest.
 
 Once that happens, we will not have to insist on passengers showing identity cards along with tickets.” To study this model, Singh visited the Bangalore airport earlier this week as an Aadhaar-linked biometric system is already in use there.
 
 These changes may happen sooner than expected as, for once, India’s aviation and security personnel are on the same page as far as making passengers experience at airports a seamless one is concerned. The aviation ministry is examining making Aadhaar or some other ID must for booking tickets as it is formulating a national no-fly list.
