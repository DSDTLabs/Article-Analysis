Pune: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) published a ward-level manifesto on Wednesday. Apart from eight common points for all the wards, the party has given specific projects based on the needs of each panel.

 Discussions were carried out with different groups, including lawyers, doctors, engineers, sports personalities, writers, Ganapati mandals, public transport users and PMC employees for the manifesto.
 
 “Public participation is important for the improvement of civic life. The local level agenda will increase public contribution,” Vinay Sahastrabuddhe, national vice president of BJP, told TOI. 
 
 The ward-wise agenda has kept common points such as senior citizens’ centre, gardens, skill development centre, business development groups, yoga centres, cultural centre and garbage processing units.
 
 In its draft manifesto in December, the party has stated that old public health projects such as setting up of a municipal medical college, primary health centres, OPDs and ICUs in civic hospitals will be taken up.
