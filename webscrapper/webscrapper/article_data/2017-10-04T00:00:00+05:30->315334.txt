With Dileep being granted bail, the question on many minds is whether he can act again as all Malayalam film associations had revoked his membership. 

 However AMMA Vice president   tells us, " Dileep can act in films whether or not he is in AMMA. It is true that   had said that Dileep’s primary membership from AMMA was being cancelled. But it is not possible as per the AMMA rules. He can only be suspended from the association and that too after a detailed inquiry by a disciplinary committee set up by the association. So what Mammootty said was baseless and I think he was trying to please   by saying so. Now, Dileep should decide if he wants to be part of AMMA or not. If I am in his place, I will not join AMMA or any association even if they tell me ‘ponnukondu pulissery vechutharam’. Dileep can remain strong and go ahead with films in full swing. I am extremely happy that Dileep is granted bail. I am proud today for standing by him duing his adversity facing all the attacks from media. People also stood by him." 
 
 Meanwhile  , a representative of Women in Cinema tells us that bail doesn’t mean he is 
 free of the charges. "We respect the decision of the court. Our fight is to get her (assaulted actress) justice and we stand by her. However, I do not think we need to connect the success of his film   with his involvement in the crime. 
 Even the court granting him bail doesn’t mean that he is free of the charges against him. We knew we will have to face this soon when we went out to fight. There is nothing shocking about this."
