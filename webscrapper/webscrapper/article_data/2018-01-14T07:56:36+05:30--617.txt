MUMBAI:   has demanded an indepth probe into the death of B H Loya, who as special   judge was hearing the case of gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh’s “fake” encounter. “If you haven’t done any crime why are you afraid,” the   president remarked, targeting the   while talking to mediapersons on Saturday. “Is someone trying to make the judiciary dumb and deaf?” he asked.

 The Loya case was one of the triggers for four judges of the   to hold a press conference in New Delhi on Friday, a first in the annals of the apex court, and launch an unprecedented attack on SC chief justice Dipak Misra against his assigning of key cases to benches headed by junior SC judges, ignoring senior ones.
 
 Asked about the judges’ revolt, Uddhav demanded a probe into Loya’s death. “If someone thinks that Loya has died under suspicious circumstances and has asked for a probe, then an indepth probe needs to be conducted in order to get to the truth of the case,” he said. “The SC stir has affected the country’s sovereignty,” he added.
 
 Stating that the revolt of four top SC judges was “deeply shocking,” Thackeray expressed fears that such incidents may weaken the integrity of the judiciary and shake the faith of the people in the apex court.
 
 The Sena leader urged the Centre not to interfere in the SC row. “Let the judges sort it out among themselves,” he said. He said the four SC judges should not be victimised. “They may have to face action, but the action should not be arbitrary,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, the family of the minor girl who was raped and murdered in Kopardi in 2016 met Uddhav and demanded that   be continued as the public prosecutor in the case even in the high court.
