KOLKATA: Kolkata Police has called for procuring 50 drones. Also,   will be installed in south Kolkata. The move, claim Lalbazar officers, will help cops counter terror operations and strengthen law and order.

 However, the plan to procure 50 drones has raised the eyebrows. A section of cops believes that there are more pressing problems that needed to be addressed first. Lalbazar, though, maintained that unlike now — when it has two drones at its disposal — the new drones will be used for surveillance 24 hours. “We plan to use them in crowded areas like central business district,   and market areas like Gariahat,” said a  . “Increasing the number of patrolling vehicles at every police station is the need of the hour,” said an officer from a police station in southeast Kolkata.
 
 The tender asks that the supplier should also be commissioning, customizing, training and maintaining the drones. Further, the drones must come with at least three years’ warranty. “E-Tender are invited by the police commissioner on behalf of Governor of West Bengal from the bonafide dealers/ original equipment manufacturers / system integrator (SI/Industrial Undertakings/ organizations own and managed by Government based on medium and large scale units for “E-Tender for Supply, Commissioning Customization, Training and three years warranty and maintenance of 50 numbers of ‘DRONE’ for Kolkata Police,” the document reads.
