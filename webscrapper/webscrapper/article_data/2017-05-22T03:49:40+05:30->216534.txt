RANCHI/JAMSHEDPUR: A day after the steel city was rocked with clashes following the lynching of nine people over the last one week, police are yet to ascertain the source of rumour mongering, which they believe led to the violence.

 “If proper preventive measures had been taken and people’s apprehensions were assuaged on time, the matter might not have snowballed into this,” said a police officer.
 
 The administration had deployed additional forces, including two companies of Rapid Action Force, in minority-dominated pockets to control the situation.
 
 Seraikela superintendent of police (SP) Rakesh Bansal said, “Two people — Dhananjay Jyotish and Dinesh Mahato— were arrested on Sunday.”
 
 “We have arrested 20 people in the last 24 hours in connection with Nagadih and Mango violence,” said IG, Operations,
