KOZHIKODE: There has been certain course corrections and attitudinal changes in the   after the incident of attack against an actress in Kochi in February 2017, Kerala Chalachitra Academy chairman Kamal has said.

 
 Speaking to media at the Calicut Press Club here on Monday, Kamal said that there has been a realization that it was not good to harbour personal rivalries and enmity within the industry.
 
 “It is for the court to decide on who is behind the incident and I would not comment on that. But during a particular period, there used to be personal rivalries and conflicts within the industry due to various reasons. But now there is a growing realisation that it is not good and that there should be space for everyone, from super stars to small-time actors. I think it is an important change,” Kamal said in response to a question.
 
 
 He said that in the past there used to be instances of some people being deliberately kept away from the movies. “Some actors, producers and technicians used to insist that some people should not be part of their movies. It has now changed,” he added.
 
 
 However, Kamal said that Malayalam   still harboured a strong misogynistic attitude with respect to themes of films and treatment.
 
 
 “We have been seeing it clearly on screen for quite some time. But I would say that it is not prevalent in the filmsets. I would rather say the workspace issues in film industry were more or less similar to that of other sectors,” he added.
 
 
 He said that the formation of Women in   (WCC) and the women’s association of FEFKA were positive developments as the issues raised by them were very relevant.
 
 
  Chelavoor Venu, deputy director (programees) at Chalachitra Academy, N P Sajeesh were present on the occasion.
