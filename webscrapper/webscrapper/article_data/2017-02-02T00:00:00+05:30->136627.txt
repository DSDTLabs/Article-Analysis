One moniker that Bengaluru has proudly flaunted is its Rock Capital of India tag. The pubs in the city have stood by this as well. And while the city has had the hottest nightclubs spinning the best dance numbers, most Bengalureans once took pride in the old-school pubs with rock and metal playing in the background, singing along with the anthems on the playlist and bonding over trivia about each of their favourite rock bands. Sadly, though, in recent years, the number of rock pubs in the city’s   (CBD) has seen a steady decline.
Last year alone saw a couple of landmark pubs shut shop in the area, which included Purple Haze on Residency Road and Tavern on Museum Road. This area, at one point, flaunted a host of rock pubs that allowed one to hop across for a quick pint in each as they explored different genres of rock and metal at each of these watering holes.
 Old-timers remember names like Nightwatchman, Styx,   and more.   believes that while rock can never die in Bengaluru, there is a definite slump in the number of people following the music. “Youngsters in Bengaluru, like everywhere else, are bigger fans of house, EDM, tech and popular dance numbers. One of the biggest reasons for such a following is the way these names are thrown around on social media by their publicity machinery. It is hard to not notice them or their music. They go all-out to ensure that people everywhere know them. On the contrary, rock bands have a more old-school way of functioning and this is why the culture of rock seems to be completely lost. There would, hence, be a greater turnout to, say, an   concert than a Dire Straits gig. Though, I wouldn’t write the fan following off because we have already seen the revival of old-school hip hop, so you never know when rock will gain popularity with the new generation,” he says.
