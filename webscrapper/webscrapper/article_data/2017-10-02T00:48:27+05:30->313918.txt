Chennai: The International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care (PCVC) is launching a pilot for a statewide tele support line for burn   next month. The line is aimed at connecting them and their families to the nearest medical services.

 This is an initiative to save more lives as survivors of only 40% of burn cases received by hospitals manage to survive, said Dr Prasanna Gettu, Founder of PCVC, which provides medical services and rehabilitation to   admitted to the Kilpauk Medical College burns ward.
 
 The 24x7   would help burns survivors connect to the nearest hospitals, and will create a support system for post-burn care, physiotherapists, psychosocial interventions, and integrate them back into the community. 
 
 A National Burns Support hotline would create a toll-free number that burns survivors, their families and caregivers can dial during an emergency to access immediate and timely medical help as well as follow-up and referrals services that provide information to meet the needs of survivors at various stages of the recovery process.
 
  The proposed platform will create a database of available stakeholders, such as police and PCVC volunteers, across all spheres in every district of a given state and will be piloted in Tamil Nadu. “We have identified 75 hospitals in the state and nearing borders of Andhra Pradesh and Kerala which can be a part of our hotline framework,” said Lakshmi, of PCVC.
 
 The trust is looking forward for funds to set up the extensive helpline that would be rolled out across the country if the pilot in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring areas is a success.
 
 The objective of the hotline is to strengthen the already existing crisis line (044-43111134) that provides assistance to domestic violence and burn survivors to help them take charge of their lives and find means to earn a livelihood.
