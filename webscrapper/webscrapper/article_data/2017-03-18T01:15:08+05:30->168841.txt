Lucknow: Police are now on the lookout for two persons, Sarfaraz and Piyush, who had lodged a complaint against Madras University doctor M Sudheer. 

 Sudheer (57), a Chennai-based doctor, was arrested on February 24 on the basis of an FIR lodged against him at Aliganj police station in June last year by one Sarfaraz, a city-based real estate agent. In the FIR, the doctor was accused of not paying back Rs 1 crore taken for opening a medical college in UP.
 
 A CBI court had granted bail to Sudheer on Thursday after police admitted lapses in probe.
 
 “There have been lapses in the case,” said inspector, Indiranagar, Dhirendra Kushwaha, who is now investigating the case. SSP has set Saturday deadline for completion of probe. 
 
 “We are finding out how complainants got in touch with M.Kamraj, who implicated Dr. Sudheer,” ASP Aliganj Meenakshi Gupta told TOI.
