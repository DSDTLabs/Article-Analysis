LUDHIANA: Eight years after his return to Ludhiana as the commissioner of police (crime prevention),   has his priorities set out. Law and order, crime prevention and community policing will be his main focus areas. 

 “I have served in Ludhiana before. All-out efforts will be made to better policing in the city,” said Gill after taking over the charge on Sunday. 
 
 “I will study the ground situation before devising a strategy. Better policing will include improved traffic management, crime prevention and detection,   and justice to people. We will upgrade residents’ grievance redressal mechanism and promote community policing,” added Gill, who did his MBBS from Amritsar Medical College. 
 
 About his plans to make city safe for women, he said he would first study the scenario in the city and then plan measures. 
 
 On residents not preferring visiting police stations, fearing “misbehaviour” of cops, Gill said, “We will try to change the image of police and ensure they behave in a good way with residents. Injustice to anyone will not be tolerated. We will involve resident welfare associations (RWAs), seek their feedback and support to improve law and order.”
 
 Rough vehicular movement and jams will also be dealt with. “Steps will be taken to improve the traffic scenario,” he added. 
 
 Gill received a ceremonial guard of honour before taking charge in the morning. The new top cop was the Ludhiana senior superintendent of police in 2009-10 after which the city got the status of a police commissionerate.
 
 An IPS officer of 2003 batch, he was Chandigarh SSP from 2013 to 2016 before being promoted as Ferozepur deputy inspector general of police. 
 
 He was   range DIG before his Ludhiana appointment.
 
 Gill succeeds  , who has been appointed as Chandigarh ADGP (security).
