KOCHI: Two of the city's heritage troves-the   and the St Francis Church- will soon be accessible to people with disabilities with the   (ASI) deciding to step in to modify the two monuments in two phases.

 "The plan is to place signages and braille signs inside the building in the first three months. In the next six months, ramps and pathways will be set up inside the structures. We are still working on the designs and its costs so that we can present an estimate to the department for funds," said Smitha  , superintending archaeologist in-charge, ASI  .
 
 Due to space constrictions at the  , building of ramps will be in a limited format, enabling those on wheelchair to move around the church through a separate pathway. "At the Dutch Palace, the stairs leading to the museum is quite steep and thus the construction of a ramp beside it would deem futile. So, we are planning a suspended lift, which will be designed to carry a person with a wheelchair and help them enter through a window. It can be used for the elderly also, if needed. 
 
 However, for the construction of the lift an MoU needs to be signed between the ASI and the  , as the ASI owns only the first floor of the palace whereas the land is owned by the board. Discussions are on," Sumathy said. Construction of toilets accessible to disabled people will also be included in the modification plans. "At the St Francis Church, however, again due to space constriction, the existing toilet blocks will have to be modified to make them disabled-friendly. In other places, a separate one can be constructed exclusively for them. All the works are expected to be completed in a year at the maximum," Sumathy added. 
 
 The new schemes are being worked for the structures listed under 'Adarsh Monuments', which includes four structures in Kerala.
