PANAJI:   Lifesaving, the government-appointed lifeguard service manning the state’s beaches, has issued a   advisory with temperatures likely to peak this month. It offers simple ways to stay safe at the beach during the scorching summer. Owing to current sea conditions, Drishti has advised swimmers not to venture into ‘no-swim zones’, which are marked with red flags. 

 
  
  
 
 Zones marked with yellow flags indicate moderate currents, thereby making them safe to swim in, Drishti said. 
 
 In its advisory, Drishti said that the sea, inviting as it seems during the sweltering heat, could have rip currents, flash currents, and underwater currents, and that beach-goers always need to be cautious before taking a dip.
 
 Drishti’s entire team of lifeguards, it said, are trained to carry out rescues even in rough sea conditions. However, the agency noted, swimmers need to be cautious. 
 
 The   (IMD) has warned that temperatures could rise by 3-5C in parts of Goa. It is common for domestic tourists and locals to flock to the beach for some respite from the soaring mercury. 
 
 Every morning, Drishti lifeguards map sea currents, changes in wind patterns, and underwater activity in order to identify safe swim zones along every beach. They then mark them with red and yellow flags. 
 
 Drishti has stationed its lifeguards at 22 beaches in south Goa and 16 in north Goa. Additionally, there are also lifeguards at Mayem lake and at the Dudhsagar waterfall.
