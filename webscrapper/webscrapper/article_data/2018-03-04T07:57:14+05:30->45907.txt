LUCKNOW:  , who was sacked from the   ( ) following his meeting with Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, says he will not take part in any out-of-court settlement talks on the   dispute. 

 On Thursday night, Nadwi said he wouldn't take part in any settlement talks initiated by Sri Sri, and instead would wait for the Supreme Court verdict. He said he had taken the decision after AIMPLB president Maulana Rabey Hasan Nadwi and Maulana Arshad Madani opposed it. 
 
 Nadwi made the announcement through a video message on his official social media accounts, claiming that a large number of Hindu and Muslims wasn't ready for any out-of-court settlement. 
 
 "People on both sides have become abusive. We have always looked forward to SC verdict. But there was no harm in trying for a peaceful solution. Since the majoritarian view on both sides is against it, I strike off the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute from my agenda," said Nadwi. 
 
 "Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and I discussed the issue twice through video conferencing and twice in person. When I met him on Thursday, I told him that many people are against my initiative," he said. 
 
 Nadwi's statement came as a surprise since Art of Living director Gautam Vij had on Thursday said another round of talk on the Ayodhya dispute would be held between Nadwi and Sri Sri in Lucknow on March 28. 
 
 Nadwi said he is ready to re-join the AIMPLB, but would do so only when Asaduddin Owaisi, Kamal Farooqui, Qasim Rasool and Yusuf Machala are expelled from the board. 
 
 He advised the board to cut down expenses on fighting the case on Ayodhya.
