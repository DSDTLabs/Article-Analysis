Rajkot: The 21-year-old woman, who had honeytrapped a city businessman to extort Rs 21 lakh, was arrested from Jamnagar along with her friend and accomplice in the crime. 

 Police arrested Jahnvi Ahir alias Jagruti Makwana and her accomplice Kuldeep Parmar. The duo along with four others operate a gang that traps rich people and extort money from them by threatening to frame them in rape cases. Jahnvi was arrested in a similar case earlier too.
 
 Gandhigram police inspector H R Bhattu said, “Jahnvi made a fake Facebook ID in the name of Jahnvi. Her friend Parmar also accompanied her. All the accused in this case have been arrested.” The victim Girish Bhut, who owns a factory and lives in Mavdi Chowk, had befriended Jahnvi on Facebook around three months ago. On April 25, Jahnvi asked him to meet her casually near Nageshwar area on Jamnagar road. 
 
 When he reached there on his bike, five others — Geeta, Rasila, Ketan, Kuldeep and Sailesh Siparia — joined them and forcibly took him on a bike to an isolated spot. There, he was forcefully undressed and Jahnvi too removed her clothes. The five other persons then forced him to pose in a compromising position with her and they started clicking his pictures. But the trauma did not end here. They even forced him to masturbate and collected the semen in a condom.
