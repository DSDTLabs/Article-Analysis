PUNE:   took up shooting just three years ago. But it seems that time was enough for the double trap shooter from Meerut to achieve his goal of representing Indian seniors in three ISSF World Cups to be held this year.

 Shapath, 14, will be the youngest participant among the Indians in the World Cups, the first of which is scheduled to be held in New Delhi next month. The other double trap shooters in the Indian contingent are   and  .
 
 Shapath's career is shaped by his coach  , who trains him at Karni Singh range in Delhi.Shapath was spotted by Olympian Ronjan Singh Sodhi in 2014. “When I met him in 2014, he asked me to help him with his shooting. I don't coach anyone, so I told Yogendra to train him.I told him that this boy will make you proud one day , so don't take money from him,“ Ronjan said.
 
 Shapath participated in the senior category in the nationals last year and shot 136150. He then participated in the selection trials and shot 122 & 136 to finish overall second on average scores.That clinched his berth for World Cups. Ronjan, the former World No. 1 who was spot on in recognising Shapath's talent, himself finished 10th in the selection trials.
 
 A ninth standard student in Meerut Cant, Shapath was inspired by his elder brother Shrey who used to shoot in the same event. While Shrey decided to give up shooting and focus on his education, Shapath's interest in the sport grew stronger. “I used to accompany my brother for training at Karni Singh range. We used to travel from Meerut and I would fire random shots in between his training. But in 2014, I decided to take up the sport seriously,“ Shapath told TOI. He won the state championships in first attempt in 2014 and later participated in the shooting nationals and National Games in 2015.
