The state government has purchased an app from the union government for speedy submission of the police verification report (PVR) and it will help the passport authority issue passports to the applicants within a week, according to G  , regional passport officer of Coimbatore.

 The ministry of external affairs had launched a mobile passport police app called mApp for speedy submission of PVR in January 2016. The app enables police to upload verification details of an applicant using a handheld device (tabloid). The app will be installed in the tabloid and the policemen have to click some photographs of the applicant at home and sent them to the respective passport office with the help of the tab. The policemen have to fill few details of the applicant with the app and sent it to the intelligence section officersâ€™ system. The intelligence section or special branch police officers approves it after verifying the details through mApp. After receiving the verification details, the regional passport office will print the passport within a day and will be dispatched immediately. "We expect that the mApp will be launched by the Chief Minister within two months. The tabs had already been procured by the police department and the implementation process is on," said Sivakumar.
