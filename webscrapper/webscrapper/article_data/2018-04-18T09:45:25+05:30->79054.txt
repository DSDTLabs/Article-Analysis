MANDYA: Photos of   (SIP) candidate from Melukote, Darshan   lending his shoulders to carry the bier of a farmer have gone viral.

 The incident took place recently in Sadanahalli village in   taluk under Melukote constituency.
 
 Darshan, who was campaigning near Sadanahalli, heard about farmer Krishne Gowda’s death due to illness in the village. Cutting short his campaign, Darshan rushed to the village and consoled the family members and relatives. He then joined the relatives in the funeral procession and carried the bier bearing the farmer’s body. He went till the cremation ground about a km away from the village and participated in the last rites.
 
 “As I came to know about the incident, I joined the family members in the last journey and paid my respect to the farmer,” said Darshan.
 
 Darshan’s father, K S Puttannaiah, was a farmers’ leader of reckoning and represented Melukote till his death recently.
 
 “Puttannaiah never missed attending to farmers’ problems. He’d visit their homes in case of deaths in the family. He knew farmers won’t have money even to conduct last rites of the deceased. Darshan is following in the footsteps of his father Puttannaiah,” said Melukote taluk SIP president HN Vijaykumar.
