MUMBAI: Seeking bail before the   on Monday, Shrikant Shivade, counsel for 2008 Malegaon blast accused  , said a mandatory procedure in the sanctioning process was bypassed by the state, hence vitiating the prosecution.

 “On December 31, 2008, the Act was amended widening the definition of terrorist acts and as a safeguard, a provision was introduced requiring an independent authority to also assess the investigation and evidence gathered,” said Shivade. “The authority was to make an independent review of the probe and forward it to the sanctioning authority within seven days. But in Purohit’s case, the sanction granted by then home secretary Chitkala Zutshi, on January 19, 2009, does not mention such an independent review.” 
 
 Shivade added that ‘an inquiry under the RTI Act also revealed that no independent authority was even appointed and thus, the provision had been bypassed’. 
 
 On Tuesday, the HC bench of Justices R V More and Shalini Phasalkar Joshi will hear the bail plea of accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur.
