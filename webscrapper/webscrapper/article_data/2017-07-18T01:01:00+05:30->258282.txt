Last month, a group of research scholars from   started a   page called ‘IIT KGP RS Confessions’ for ‘frustrated’ students of the institution. A student, whose life is troubled by his research or someone who has recently been refused by his or her crush or perhaps students who are reeling under study pressure can write their story here. The administrators of the group, who did not reveal their identities, told us they started the group last month after a number of suicides by students on campus. “We felt that a large number of students needed a platform to communicate. There are many things they can’t share with anyone else and that is making them take drastic steps,” said an admin. He said in order to maintain secrecy within the group, they accept stories from students anonymously. Each of the posts is monitored by the administrators and then posted with a number. “People read them and provide solutions to the problem and the writers get a sense of being a part of a community. This was the main reason we created this group,” said the admin. The community already has around 1,000 hits and the number is growing every day.
