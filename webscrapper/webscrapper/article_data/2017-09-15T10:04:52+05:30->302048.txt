In the latest episode of Sasural   Ka, while the Bharadwaj family mourns the death of Simar,   rejoices and asks   to join her in cutting the cake. Sanjana slaps Samir for killing her mom. But he is unaffected and gives her the ‘mangalsutra’ back. Bhairavi tells her that no one can take her son away and congratulates Samir for taking revenge from his dad's murderers. 

 Just then, Bhairavi gets a call and it's Dhanraj, her husband, on the other side. This scares Bhairavi and makes her question the caller. Suddenly the lights go off and Dhanraj's voice can be heard. He threatens to tell Samir the truth. Bhairavi confesses that he cannot be alive as she had killed him herself. Lights turn on and Bhairavi finds Simar along with Samir and others. 
 
 
  
 Samir is furious at Bhairavi for killing his dad. He shows her the post-mortem report which reveals that his father was died due to a gunshot and not by a car accident. Bhairavi is dazed. Simar then reveals how everything was planned in a way that they were able to expose her truth to Samir. 
 
 Prem also tells Samir that Bhairavi is a drug dealer and uses to supply to his friends as well. This leaves everyone shocked.
