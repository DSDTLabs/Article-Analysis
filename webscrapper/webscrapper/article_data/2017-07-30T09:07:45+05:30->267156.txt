GURUGRAM: A class X student died while trying to save his friend from   in the   canal near   in Gurgaon on Saturday afternoon. Neither   (17) nor Sandeep (16) knew how to swim. But when Shivam saw Sandeep slip into the water and lash around trying to stay afloat, he instinctively jumped in to save him. Eventually, both drowned.

 Police said Shivam and Sandeep — both students of the government high school in Budhera and residents of Garhi village — had gone to take a bath in the canal around 12.30pm with three other friends. The three friends said Sandeep and Shivam were bathing on the steps. They, on the other hand, were swimming in deep waters then and were quite away from the duo. By the time the three realised that Sandeep and Shivan were struggling to stay afloat and rushed to their rescue, the two drowned.
 
 “We just wanted to take a dip. Since Sandeep and Shivan did not know swimming, they stayed on the steps and bathed there. But Sandeep slipped and fell into deep water. Shivam jumped into the water to save him without sparing a thought. He too died while trying to save Sandeep,” said one of the friends.
 
 They immediately raised an alarm, prompting local villagers to call police. Fire brigade personnel and divers were called in. The two bodies were fished out of the canal after an hour-long search. A report has been lodged at Rajendra Park police station. “Prima facie it appears to be an accident, and we haven’t found anything that suggests any foul play,” said inspector Ajayveer Bhadana, SHO, Rajendra Park police station.
