 The Mumbaikar said he was mentally prepared for the event. “I was mentally prepared for this and I’m glad that I finally got the nod. We’ve a very strong team and we can win a lot of medals. We’ll be playing against England and Singapore in doubles and in individual category we will be taking on top paddlers like Aruna Qadri of Nigeria and England’s Liam Pitchford. Our paddlers have beaten some of the top-ranked players in recent times and our morale is quite high. We’ve always done well in CWG and we’re confident of coming back with more medals this time,” Sanil told TOI before leaving for Australia on Saturday.
 
 IOA had earlier shot down Sanil’s name as replacement. However, following TTFI’s prolonged persuasion, both IOA and CWG Council allowed the replacement under “extenuating circumstances”. 
 
 “We tried hard for this and we were confident of getting a replacement. We are one of the stronger teams and have solid chances of winning medals in every category. TTFI had no other option but to suspend Soumyajit. It was an unexpected development and we deserved to get a replacement. We’re thankful to CWG Council and IOA for their continuous support,” MP Singh said.
 
 The nine-member Indian squads (men & women), accompanied by head coach Massimo Costantini and other support staff, had left for Gold Coast on Friday. Sanil will join his teammates A Sharath Kamal, Harmeet Desai, G Sathiyan and Anthony Amalraj on Sunday. The women’s team includes Manika Batra, Mouma Das, Madhurika Patkar, Pooja Sahasrabudhe and Sutirtha Mukherjee.
