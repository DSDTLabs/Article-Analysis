GURUGRAM: Residents of South City-2 have expressed happiness over the MCG’s instructions calling for expedition of the transfer of maintenance from   to the corporation, which has been pending for several months.The   asked Unitech to expedite the transfer and complete it within 4 months in a meeting held last week, residents said. 

 Speaking to TOI, Neeraj Yadav, president of   RWA, said they were invited by MCG officials last week to discuss the modalities regarding the transfer of   2, which is currently maintained by Unitech, to the MCG.
 
 “The MCG commissioner told us that the transfer has to happen as soon as possible. He gave Unitech four months’ time. They are also looking into the number of pendancies in the area”, he said.
 
 Members of KY Consultancy, which was hired to look into the civic amenities of the area before MCG’s takeover, were also present at the meeting and apprised the commissioner about the civic issues faced by the residents. “There are many areas where the roads are in a bad condition. Lack of stormwater drainage is another issue. All these were discussed in the meeting. Three power connections are yet to be given. The commssioner was surprised that connections are pending so many years after Unitech gave posession to residents,” Yadav said.
 
 The consultancy also raised the issue of the lack of adequate water storage. “We do not have the sufficient water storage. That needs to be increased,” Swati, another resident, said.
 
 An MCG official confirmed that Unitech was asked to complete the transfer within four to four-and-a-half months.
 
 “The developer was asked to address all the deficiencies found in the area, and told that MCG itself would fix them otherwise, but recovery charges would be recovered from Unitech,” the official said.
 
 Residents said MCG didn’t pass a formal order in this regard, although they will issue minutes of the meeting on Monday.
