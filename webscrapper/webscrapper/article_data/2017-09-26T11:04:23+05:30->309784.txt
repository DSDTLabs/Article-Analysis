 Earlier, the pro-strike Gorkhaland supporters torched a passenger vehicle in Lebong early on Sunday and another in Sonada late in the evening to send out a strong message to traders and shop owners who had resolved to open shutters after 101 days of shutdown. 
 
 That, however, couldn't stop several, including Glenary's, the popular restaurant-cum-confectionary outlet, from opening doors. 
 
 In Darjeeling's upper town area, a few roadside stalls opened in Toongsoong, leading off the horse stable in Chowrasta. A few business establishments selling winter garments were also open near the Chowrasta but shut shop by the afternoon. Barring Glenary's, however, prominent restaurants did not attempt to open.
