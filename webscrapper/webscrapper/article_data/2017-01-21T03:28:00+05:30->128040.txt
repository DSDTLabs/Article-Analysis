Panaji: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)   is likely to focus on employment creation and establishment of homes for the aged. The manifesto is expected to be released on January 25 or 26.

 During the 2012 assembly polls, BJP promised to create around 50,000 jobs for the youth and an unemployment dole, but by the end of its five-year tenure, they have had to face strong criticism from the opposition for not been able to keep its poll promises.
 
 The BJP has gone out of its way this time around to include all sections of society. 
 
 Election manifesto committee incharge and deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza told TOI, 
 
 “In our manifesto, we would like to promise the elderly that the BJP will build old age homes in each and every taluka,” D’ Souza said. tnn
