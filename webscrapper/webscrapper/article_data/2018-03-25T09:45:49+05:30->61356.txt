CHANDIGARH: With no reference to the implementation of the recommendations of the   in the state budget presented by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, the ambience in the Panjab University (PU) is what you can call pale. Quite justifiably, PU teachers are disappointed. Panjab University, which is an inter-state body corporate, will implement the recommendations of the pay commission only after getting notification from the Punjab government. 

 "Since the   had put the onus on the Punjab government, we have been waiting for the state government's decision to give us some benefit. Since the Punjab government will have to pay only 50% as the remaining 50% will be paid by the Central government, we were looking forward to it. But no mention of the 7th Pay Commission is so disappointing for us," said Panjab University Teachers' Association (PUTA) president  . 
 
 It was in the board of finance meeting on February 13 that  , principal secretary finance, Punjab government, had agreed that the government would consider releasing appropriate additional grant to PU on account of the implementation of 7th Pay Commission, as and when the same would get implemented for the employees of the Punjab government and other universities of Punjab. 
 
 He had also said that the amount of annual grant to PU, after the implementation of 7th CPC, shall also be re-fixed accordingly.
 
 "We are planning to launch a series of protests with the   of which we are part. MHRD had informed us us that in the last board of finance meeting, the Punjab government would review the implementation of the 7th Pay  ," added Gill.
