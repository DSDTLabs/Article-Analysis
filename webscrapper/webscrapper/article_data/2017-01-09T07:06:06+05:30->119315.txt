KARNAL: Family members of two youths who were seriously injured in an attack by a rival group on Friday are alleging that police are inactive in the case and not arresting the culprits even after two days of the incident.

 In their 20s, the two victims – Pradeep and Randeep – were attacked just outside   post on Friday when they had come to the police station to get a dispute with another group resolved. Both are residents of   and had a tussle with a group of boys on New Year’s party while dancing. The arguments turned serious and Pradeep and Randeep sought help from police. But, on their way back from the police post, the other group attacked them with swords and other sharp weapons. The boys got severely injured and were taken to civil hospital, Karnal, by family members.
 
 Mother of one of the victims said, “Both the boys are in critical condition. The government hospital did not give proper consideration and referred us to a private hospital. We asked the police for security while the boys were going back home on Friday but they did not act on it and you can see the result. We want justice. All of them should be arrested.”
 
  incharge said, “We have registered an FIR against the six accused and some unidentified people. We will arrest them shortly. It was just a fight between young boys over dancing and we had called them for compromise. We will take action against the culprits.”
