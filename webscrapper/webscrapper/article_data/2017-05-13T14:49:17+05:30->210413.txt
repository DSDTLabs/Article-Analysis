GUWAHATI: After the barriers between Manipur and Nagaland were demolished in a historic meeting between chief ministers of both the states in Imphal last Tuesday, the Tanghkhul Naga-dominated Ukhrul district has now become the centre of the newfound friendship. 

 Manipur chief minister   has invited a delegation from Nagaland to participate in the annual   at Shirui village in Ukhrul district from May 16 to 20. The state flower, shirui lily, is found in abundance in Ukhrul which is also the home district of NSCN(I-M) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah. 
 
 "Both sides (Manipur and Nagaland) are eager to build goodwill between various communities as well as the two states. When the Nagaland CM visited Imphal, Manipur chief minister verbally invited a delegation of Nagaland to the Shirui Lily Festival and a cultural troupe from Nagaland is likely to go there," Nagaland chief minister's office told the TOI.
 
 For the first time, the Shirui Lily Festival will be celebrated at the state level this time. Soon after assuming charge, Biren travelled to Ukhrul, the first time in the last 15 years of   rule in the state when hostilities were at the peak.
 
 Last Tuesday's meeting in Imphal was historic as it was the first time that a chief minister of Nagaland travelled to Manipur to meet his counterpart ever since Nagaland attained statehood in 1963, the chief minister's office said. It added, "The ice-breaking meeting was aimed at building better ties."
 
 "Manipur not just aims to promote and showcase the rich culture of the Tangkhul tribe at the festival but also use the platform to strengthen communal harmony," said an official from Manipur.
