Trichy: A 35-year-old man allegedly murdered his cousin at Keermangalam in Trichy district on Tuesday night as she refused his proposal to marry her. 

 The man also inflicted injuries on his father’s two brothers over the issue. The injured included the woman’s father. 
 
 The accused T Sathyakumar from Keeramangalam hacked S Hemalatha, 27, to death at her house in the same village on Tuesday night. 
 
 She was the daughter of his father’s younger brother Sivasubramaniam, 65. 
 
 Sathyakumar visited Hemalatha’s house on Tuesday night and picked up a quarrel with Sivasubramaniam and family members stating that they should allow him to marry her. However, they turned down his proposal saying that she was like a sister to him as she was the daughter of his father’s brother.
 
 Angered by their reply, he attacked them with a sickle. Hemalatha, who came in to her father’s rescue was attacked on her neck killing her on the spot. 
 
 Sivasubramaniam and his brother Vairavel, who suffered injuries, were admitted to a private hospital in Trichy.
 
 The Kollidam police who began investigations found out that Sathyakumar was unemployed and was insisting on marrying Hemalatha, an employee with a private firm in Thillai Nagar. 
 
 He expressed his feeling for her but she rejected it. She also advised him not to follow her with such intentions as he was her brother. 
 
 His family members too had reprimanded him for his desire.
 
 The Kollidam police registered a case and are searching for Sathyakumar who escaped from the spot.
 
 The body was sent to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital for postmortem. Further investigations are on.
