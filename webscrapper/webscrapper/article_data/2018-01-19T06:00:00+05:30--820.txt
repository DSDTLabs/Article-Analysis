Kolkata: Calcutta high court lawyer and Congress leader Arunava Ghosh has made an application under RTI Act, 2005, seeking information on the amount of money spent towards medical treatment of Justice Arun Mishra when he was Chief Justice of Calcutta high court.

 Ghosh took the cue from a writ filed by lawyer Pintu Karat, following which the court administration stated that money was spent on Mishra and his wife for treatment. 
 
 Ghosh made a fresh   on Monday wanting to know details of the medical expenses and also the account from which this expenditure was made. He also wanted the Bengal government to come clear under which rule of the Judges Act the state government decided to foot the bill. “I want to know the details because I am given to understand that the expenses were made by the state government from the account meant for medical expenses towards ministers and secretaries. Reimbursement of medical bills for judges of the high court is made from a different account guided by rules framed under Judges Act, a central Act,” he said.
 
 Ghosh’s RTI came after an SC bench dismissed an SLP from Delhi high court praying for disclosure of medical expenses towards judges. Justice Mishra was one among the SC bench.
