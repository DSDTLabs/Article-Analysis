KARNATAKA: In a no-holds-barred attack on the ruling   in Karnataka, UP chief minister   on Friday held Siddaramaiah government responsible for the birth and flourishing of ‘jihadism’ in the state. Also, in a change of strategy, he spent Thursday night at a 'math' run by the Lingayat sect instead of his own Natha sect, as planned earlier.

 Karnataka goes to polls on May 12 and Yogi has been roped in by the   to address 35 rallies across coastal, north and south Karnataka. He addressed nine rallies on Thursday and Friday and kept up his frontal attack on Karnataka CM   with repeated references to "jihadism".
 
 "This government has failed to arrest the alarming issue of killing of nationalists. Instead this state has become a breeding ground of ‘jihadism’ under Siddaramiah rule," he said addressing a gathering in Davengere.
