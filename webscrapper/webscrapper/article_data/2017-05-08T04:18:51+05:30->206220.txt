NEW DELHI: The clear advantage that   has come to enjoy in the electoral college for the President’s election has increased the pressure on the opposition to select a weighty candidate who will make the contest a high-profile ideological clash, a key reason why the fledgling grouping of anti-saffron parties has not been able to finalise a name.

 As the war of wits over presidential election starts, BJP appears to have been helped by its massive win in the UP assembly polls. While regional parties and   have started discussions over fielding a common candidate, there is a belief that the contest they are reconciled to lose would make sense if it comes across as an ideological challenge to a “communal” party which has put the “idea of India” under threat.
 
 The idea has sent key players of the opposition camp in search of a name who would match the billing. Their eyes are on persons of standing in civil society who would not arouse cynicism among people but would appeal to a vast swathe of electorate by their goodwill.
 
 While a couple of political veterans are willing to offer themselves for the losing battle, they are not seen to serve the objective of setting up an ideological clash. The numbers with the   alliance coupled with support from Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the likely backing from AIADMK would put BJP comfortably past the challenge.
 
 The headroom gives BJP the option of selecting a candidate of its choice, like an RSS ideologue to deepen the party appeal or a saffronite from SC/ST classes who would help in making a strong identity statement.
 
 The opposition is faced with the task of matching the saffron tricks. Sources said given the spurt in lynching of Muslims, the opposition focus will be on gau rakshaks and “rising intolerance” in its bid to frame the presidential contest as an ideological clash.
