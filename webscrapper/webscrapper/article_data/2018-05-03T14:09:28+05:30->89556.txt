 In his petition, A Febin Rahaman, son of Abdul Kader from Rajarathinam Nagar, said the sleuths interrogated him several times in connection with the murder of Hindu Munnani functionary C Sasikumar. “I was summoned on April 11 stating there were queries about certain phone calls I made. On the day, I was questioned from 10am to 8pm. However, instead of inquiring about my phone calls, they asked about the functioning and organizational structure of Popular Front of India (PFI),” the petition said.
 
 Rahaman, who came to the commissioner's office along with his mother Ashika, also alleged that the sleuths threatened him. “They told me that I would face dire consequences if I did not agree to what they told me,” he said.
 
 He was again summoned on April 14 and his statements were videographed, Rahaman said. “Again, on April 18, I was asked to come for an inquiry without formal summons and was mentally harassed for hours,” he alleged. When NIA officers asked him to appear the next day also, he refused to do so without proper summons. Subsequently he was issued summons to appear in NIA office in Chennai on April 23. 
 
 “Since I was not well, I could not go to Chennai,’’ he said in the petition, stating that he has been going through depression because of the frequent summons. He has sought protection from the state government.
 
 NIA authorities were not available for comment.
