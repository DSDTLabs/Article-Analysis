SURAT: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has decided to set up a high mobility corridor for green coloured city buses. A provision of Rs 40 crore has been made for the project in 2017-18 budget of the civic body. These buses will run every three minutes on the 12-km circular route with 24 bus stations.

However, now with usage of public transport increasing day by day with new routes introduced, high mobility corridor will help people reach their destination faster,” said an SMC official. This high mobility corridor will pass through the heart of the city.

 This high mobility corridor will pass through  , Jilani Bridge, Ved Darwaja, Katargam Darwaja, Railway Station, Sahara Darwaja, Udhna, Mandarwaja, New Civil Hospital, Athwagate, Sardar Bridge and back to Adajan. 
 
 “Majority of the bus stops will be made under the flyovers. Where there are no flyovers it will be made on the side and would be called curb stations,” said  , executive engineer, SMC. 
 
 “The entire plan will be implemented in next few months and we expect a large section of the population to benefit out of it,” said M Thennarasan, Municipal Commissioner, Surat.
