CHANDIGARH: Despite its empty coffers, the   did not take initiatives even to recover excise dues amounting to Rs 46 crore in 2015-16 and 2016-17 from 22 licensee groups. The money was to be paid to the government on account of unlifted quota of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), Punjab-made liquor (PML) and beer. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has highlighted irregularities involving Rs 69.94 crore in 425 cases of excise department. 

 In its recent report, the CAG has pointed out that the excise department had not put in place the system for making recovery of license fee in lump sum in advance with the result that the cases of short payment of licence fee were persisting. As per the   Liquor License Rules, 1956, a liquor vend licensee is required to lift his entire quota, after paying all excise dues, by March 10 of the following year in which license was granted. In case of failure to lift any part of his quota, he is required to deposit the license fee and all other excise dues.
 
 A performance audit of the levy and collection of excise duty for the period 2011-16 brought out both systemic and compliance deficiencies that led to loss and leakage of revenues amounting to Rs 57.45 crore.
 
 The audit, after scrutiny of records, has also pointed out assistant excise and taxation commissioners of Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar-II and   did not collect cow cess of Rs 9.72 crore during 2015-16 and 2016-17 on the sale of IMFL, PML and beer bottles. Interestingly, the excise department replied to the auditors, "Collection of the cess was fraught with the risk of distorting the liquor business in the state." But the CAG said, "The reply was not tenable as the levy should be in accordance with the notification once issued till revoked."
 
 Pointing out short recovery of overtime fee from various breweries in the state, the auditors said during 2011-12 to 2015-16, the excise department charged overtime fee from one brewery of Ludhiana at the rate of Rs 1,000 per day for working beyond normal working hours instead of applicable rate of Rs 5,000, resulting in short recovery of overtime fee of Rs 52.48 lakh. The audit report says the irregularity continued in 2016-17 as well and the department failed to recover overtime fee of Rs 9.60 lakh in the year. It was only after the CAG pointed out that the department recovered the overtime fee in August 2017.
 
 In   revealed that a liquor vend licensee sold 10.84 lakh cases of beer and 9,558 cases of IMFL during the year 2015-16. But license fee of only Rs 15 lakh was realized against Rs 1.25 crore, reports says.
