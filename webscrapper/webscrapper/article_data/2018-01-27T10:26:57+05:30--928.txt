NEW DELHI: The finance ministry’s proposal to corporatise National Highways Authority of India ( ) has been put on the backburner as the government did not want to upset the current arrangement, amid view that the move will not result in major gains. 

 Apart from the department of economic affairs ( ), other wings of the government were not in favour of the plan, which was dropped, at least for the time being, after a meeting between finance minister   and transport and highways minister   earlier this week, sources told TOI. 
 
 The agency is, however, looking at options to help the government and is considering separate special purpose vehicles for clubbing projects and companies can then tap the equity market to raise funds. Already, companies such as IL&FS have used the route to raise funds. DEA was seeing the corporatisation as a revenue-yielding move for the government and hoped to enable NHAI to raise money through an initial public offering. 
 
 The move came after the department’s estimates for the current financial year kept changing and its lastminute plan to increase borrowings by Rs 50,000 crore not only spooked the markets but also left a Rs 15,000 crore dent on banks’ balance sheets. What appeared even more bizarre was its decision to alter the plan three weeks later. 
 
 At present, NHAI primarily gets government funding from fuel cess, another Rs 8,000-10,000 crore comes from toll revenue and the highways authority raises funds from market through bonds. The corporatisation plan was opposed on the grounds that the move will make toll revenue taxable and will also restrict NHAI’s ability to acquire land.
