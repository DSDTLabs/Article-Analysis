NEW DELHI: The government is preparing to defend itself strongly at the   which will conduct its third review of India's human rights record under the Universal Periodic Review ( ) procedure in Geneva on Thursday. 

 Other countries are likely to question India about steps taken to protect minorities, gays and women. The UK is likely to seek an answer from India on what steps it is taking to ensure swift adoption of the Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence Bill.
 
 The government is also likely to face some tough questions on alleged human rights violations in J&K. Attorney general   is expected to focus on India's credible criminal justice system and, in that context, is expected to highlight the fair trial that terror accused like   and Yakub Memon got.
 
  On Tuesday, Rohatgi said he would represent the country and "put forth India's record of protection of human rights in front of the group of member nations in council". The UPR is a process which involves a review of the human rights records of all   member states.
