GURUGRAM: Residents of   have complained of shortage of water supply for last two days and blamed civic agencies of turning a deaf ear to their problems.

 According to residents, water supply stopped after Thursday morning. “We haven’t got a drop of water for the last 48 hours. The last time we got water was on Thursday morning for just 15 minutes,” said  , a resident of Sector 21. The sector’s RWA said   is an ongoing issue. “Two pockets in our sector — the pocket near   mandir and the B pocket — sometimes don’t get water even in winter. We’ve sent several requests to the authorities to lay a new pipeline in the area. While the pipeline work started in June last year, it is yet to be completed,” said Col Omed Singh, president of Sector 21 RWA.
 
 “We have complained to Huda,   and the developer, but they all keep passing the buck. While   officials say MCG is now looking after water supply, MCG officials say the maintenance company has to look into the matter,” said Dinesh Chaudhary, another resident. The sector is supplied water from the Basai water treatment plant. 
 
 When contacted, an MCG official said, “Water supply to the area is absolutely normal. The pipeline will be completed soon.”
