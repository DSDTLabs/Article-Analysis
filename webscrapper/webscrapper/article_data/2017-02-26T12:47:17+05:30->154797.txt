BHUBANESWAR: The   on Saturday staged a   in front of the office of the   (SEC) here demanding repolls in 10 booths of the   under Niali assembly constituency in Cuttack district.

 The workers, led by youth wing president   and students' wing president Itish Pradhan, urged the commission to consider their demand and order for repolls. Pradhan alleged that BJD workers captured these booths and indulged in booth rigging on February 21, in the last phase of the rural polls.
 
 "The BJD workers were very much aware that Congress candidate Sashikanta Lenka will win the election for the zilla parishad zone. So they captured the booths to turn this in favour of their candidate," Pradhan said.
 
 Pradhan blamed supporters of Niali's BJD MLA Pramod Mallick. "We have the CD bearing the video of their illegal conduct inside the polling booths. We have submitted it to the SEC so that justice is done," he said.
 
 A 15-member delegation also met the state election commissioner and requested him to consider their plea. Youth wing president Maharathy alleged that polling officials and police officers did not stop the BJD workers from booth rigging.
