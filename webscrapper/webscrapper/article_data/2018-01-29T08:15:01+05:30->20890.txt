HYDERABAD:   wasn't just a fearless journalist and a liberal democrat, but also a remarkable publisher, reckless in her idealism. That's how Chandan  , who edited a compilation of the slain scribe's essays titled: The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader, wishes to remember her.

 In a fitting tribute to Lankesh, who transitioned from English to   journalism to keep her father's newspaper,  , alive, Gowda said: "She accepted that she often faltered with the language, but her passion was unwavering. She run the paper with limited resources, but took great pride in the fact that it was always brought out on time," he said.
 
 Lankesh's essays have also been translated into Telugu and Tamil, facilitated by   and Kannan   respectively. "She bridged the gap between urban and rural India," Ramaswamy said. Sundaram had worked with Lankesh on other translations prior to her death. "A one point she had approached me saying her sister was keen on doing a movie on Perumal Murugan," Sundaram said.
 
 Incidentally, the Tamil author was present at HLF on Sunday, where his novel Poonachi (The Story of a Black Goat) was unveiled. Asked why he chose to write a story on a goat, he said: "I am fearful of writing about humans. Even more fearful of writing about gods. I can write about demons perhaps," in reference to the 2015 controversy around his novel Madhurobhagan.
