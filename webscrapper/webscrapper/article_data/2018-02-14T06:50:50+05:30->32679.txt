MUMBAI: The   administration on Wednesday is likely to table a list of plots having ‘municipal housing’ reservation on which the mayor’s new bungalow could be constructed.

 There are around 20 such plots available with the civic body in  , Malabar Hill, Lower Parel, Sion, Borla near   and Ghatkopar.
 
 The mayor’s residence is being shifted from Dadar’s Shivaji Park as the existing bungalow is being converted into a memorial for the late   founder  . At the last group leaders’ meeting, the mayor and civic chief were asked to follow up with the government to take back a BMC bungalow at Malabar Hill that is occupied by the bureaucrat couple-Pravin Darade and his wife Pallavi. They said that the legal process for allotment was not followed and the bungalow was allotted to Darade illegally. This was also because the mayor had shown interest in moving into the bungalow as his official residence. The BMC had initially proposed to shift the mayor to a bungalow within the Byculla zoo to which the later had objected as the area falls under a silence zone.
  
  
 
 Other plots that may also be considered is one at   where the BMC had recently proposed a gymkhana for its staffers. The proposal had met with stiff resistance and another plot at Worli where the rifle club is set up. Shiv Sena party leader in the BMC Yashwant Jadhav said, “There will be a discussion over the issue on Wednesday. We would see what the BMC is proposing.”
