 In the earlier promo, Salman was seen asking a girl   about how many guys pretend to be fluent in English during match-making dates. As the promo was out on social media, within no time it grabbed a lot of eyeballs from the audiences. While the second promo of the show was centered around marriages and Salman was seen asking a man how many percentage of people criticize the wedding function that they attend. The best part about the upcoming reality show is that Salman will be seen giving a peck on the cheek to all the contestant.
