The result of the Bihar Police Constable exam was likely to be released by December 2017, by the Central Selection Board of Constable (CSBC). But unfortunately, it has been delayed and there are no updates on the official website, neither are the people associated with it are replying to the queries.
 
 
 
  As quoted by a media organisation, the reason for delay is the error in the filling of the OMR sheets correctly by the candidates. It seems many candidates have not followed the prescribed format, which has made announcing the results difficult. An official, who did not want to be named, said it will take around a week’s time to declare the results.
 
  As recorded a total of 11.29 lakh candidates appeared for the Bihar Police constable recruitment exam that was conducted on October 15 and 22 across various centres in the state. A total of 9,900 vacancies will be filled through this exam. The results will be available at the board’s official website - csbc.bih.nic.in.
 
  The candidate has to score at least a minimum of 30 marks in the written examination out of 100 marks to be selected for further rounds, which will include a Physical Test.
 
  The CSBC is responsible for recruitment of police constables in Bihar. The board is headed by a three-star rank Additional Director General or Director-General level police officer.
