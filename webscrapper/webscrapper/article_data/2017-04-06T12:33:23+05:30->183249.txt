BHUBANESWAR:   on Thursday detained inspector-in-charge of Loisingha police station Antaryami Behera for allegedly carrying   of Rs 4.62 lakh in a car. 

 "Last evening, we received information from our sources that the inspector would carry the heavy cash from his house to another place. The information was true as we intercepted Behera's vehicle near Binka in Balangir district and seized the cash. The inspector failed to explain the source from where he received the money. It proves it was his ill-gotten money," DGP (vigilance) Rajendra Prasad Sharma told TOI. The anti-corruption wing said it would raid Behera's house to find out whether he amassed disproportionate assets.
 
 In a related development, the vigilance sleuths raided the house of Pabitra Mohan Mohanty, cashier of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) division in Bhubaneswar on the basis of information that he possessed disproportionate assets. Vigilance so far raided his triple-storey building at Matiapada in Puri and another house at Sudarsan Nagar in Puri. "Total value of his movable and immovable assets would be ascertained by evening," Sharma said.
