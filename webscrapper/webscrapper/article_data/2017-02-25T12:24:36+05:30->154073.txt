MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday summoned Thane municipal commissioner and the   of forests over a   about the  . A division bench of chief justice Manjula Chellur and justice Girish Kulkarni expressed dissatisfaction on the measures taken by the authorities following a report submitted in court after a site visit. 

 "There is no serious compliance of the directions of this court. In all probability the authorities have not understood the seriousness of the issue," observed the judges while asking the commissioner and conservator of forests to remain present at the next hearing of the PIL scheduled for March 2, 2017.
 
 The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by a local resident Arif Nawaz about the destruction of mangroves in Mumbra and Diva along the Ulhas river and other areas in Thane. 
 
 In a report submitted by the court commissioner, it was noticed that only for two or three days the authorities had removed some debris on the mangrove plots. 
 
 However, there was no proper clearing of the debris and obstructions of the water channels that bring tidal water and replenish the mangroves. The court said it wanted to hear from the top authorities about the measures they plan to take to save the mangrove areas. Shibu Thomas
