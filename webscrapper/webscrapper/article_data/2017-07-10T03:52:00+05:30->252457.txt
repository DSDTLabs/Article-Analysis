Margao: The numerous natural springs in the village make the quaint sleepy village of Rivona a popular getaway for picnickers during the monsoon. The Takazhor, particularly, is an all-time favourite natural spring of visitors to this village. The Takazhor has five large flows which enable several people to enjoy the water at the same time. Not long ago, villagers point out, there was a brick wall partition dividing the bathing space into compartments – one for men and the other for women. However, some anti-social elements, locals allege, damaged the partition wall, leading to a reduced flow of the spring waters. The milky white waters that rush down the spring, and its distinct taste somewhat like raw buttermilk, probably lent it the name takazhor, ‘tak’ meaning buttermilk in Konkani, villagers say. The spring is also believed to posses medicinal properties and a large number of domestic tourists head to Rivona in a bid to rid themselves of skin ailments and other health problems. “Why, even mental disorders get cured if one bathes in the waters of the Takazhor 3-4 times,” a village elder said. The waters of the spring also serve the irrigation needs of the village. The orchards and palm yards in the vicinity of the spring add to the beauty and serenity of the place.  The villagers are enraged over the fact that tourists often litter the place and dump leftovers of their meals into the spring waters, as the water is also used by the locals for drinking and washing needs.  Youngsters of the village are now keeping a close vigil on the movement of picnickers and warn them against littering the pristine place. “All are welcome to visit our village, but please do not pollute its natural resources,” a villager said.
