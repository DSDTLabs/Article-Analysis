NEW DELHI: After camping outside   for nearly  , a group of   finally managed to   lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and reportedly got an assurance that he would explore the possibility of an   to the Delhi  . 

 “We informed LG that traders can be protected from sealing if DDA makes some changes in the master plan, such as increasing the floor-area ratio. LG accepted that it can be done. He assured us that he will study the legal aspects and send a proposal to the Centre soon,” Saurabh Bharadwaj, AAP’s Delhi chief spokesperson, said.
 
 AAP has maintained that it has been doing everything in its power to alleviate the pain of traders, and Bharadwaj on Monday claimed that LG had accepted that the Centre and DDA had the “jurisdiction” to stop the sealing drive. BJP, on the other hand, has charged AAP with failing to clear 351 roads as mixed-land-use roads where commercial activities can be carried out. 
 
 A Delhi government official on Monday claimed that the commissioners of the three corporations had sought more time to clear the doubts raised by the urban development department on the issue. 
 
 Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has also sought LG’s intervention to either amend the master plan or request the Centre to bring in an ordinance to stop the drive. The FAR for local shopping centres, the CM has demanded, should be increased and conversion charges for them brought down to the level of notified commercial roads.
 
 Earlier on Monday, LG responded to a letter from Bharadwaj on the issue. Baijal wrote: “All possible solutions are being explored to overcome the crisis, keeping in view the judicial pronouncements on the subject and extant laws (sic).” He added that it was a complex matter and, if the MLAs had some suggestions, they should communicate them in writing, or through the city government’s urban development department.
