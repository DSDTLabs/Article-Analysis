MADURAI: People’s Watch Tamil Nadu has said that the one-man committee to probe the   case has been constituted against the rules.

 In a letter, to retired IAS officer  , who is to begin the inquiry on Thursday, executive director of People’s Watch Tamil Nadu Henry Tiphagne has said it must be considered that the allegation made in a telephonic conversation against a ‘higher official’ of the MKU can logically include the chancellor, the vice chancellor, the registrar, the controller of examinations, the directors in various responsibilities, the head of departments as well as members of the senate and the syndicate.
 
 The basic principle to be followed in such inquiries is that it should be led by a woman. In these days of development of gender justice, it is the basic principle that it is a woman and women alone who need to lead such inquires.
 
 Instead of conducting the inquiry, the collectors of   and Virudhunagar should be directed to immediately constitute a local complaint committee or constitute a high-level team of reputed women academicians, including preferably a former vice chancellor, and/or women lawyers.
