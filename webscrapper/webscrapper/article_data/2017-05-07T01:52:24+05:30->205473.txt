GHAZIABAD: A   told Ghaziabad Development Authority ( ) vice-chairman Kanchan Verma on Saturday that a 2016 order issued by the Allahabad high court to mitigate the township’s sewage overflow problem has not been complied with.

 The delegation demanded immediate inspection of sewer lines in Indirapuram so that remedial measures can be undertaken before the monsoon.
 
 On the basis of a PIL filed by Ghaziabad-based social activist Alok Kumar, the high court had issued an order in February 2016 directing GDA and the Federation of Apartments Owners Association ( ) to convene a meeting and draw up remedial measures for sewage overflow. 
 
 The meeting was held in the GDA headquarters near   on February 29 under the chairmanship of then GDA vice-chairman Vijay Yadav.
 
 “There was no concrete action on the ground by the GDA, even though a series of remedial measures were drawn up. GDA did not take any follow-up action on the measures. With the monsoon not far away, the township of Indirapuram stares at an impending flooding crisis on the roads again,” Kumar said.
 
 The measures that were decided upon in the joint meeting included an inspection of sewer lines in the township with the help of robotic cameras to find clogged points, desilting of clogged sewer lines, repair of damaged pipelines and laying of new pipelines wherever necessary.
