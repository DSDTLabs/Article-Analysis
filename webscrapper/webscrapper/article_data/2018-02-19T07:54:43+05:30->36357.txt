BIJNOR: Bird watchers had a pleasant surprise on Sunday when they spotted as many as 300   at the Ganga barrage. These  , mainly found in   to Mongolia and north-eastern China, come to various parts of India to spend the winter after crossing the Himalayas. However, these birds rarely come to the   in Bijnor.

 That is why the presence of the flock of demoiselle cranes in the area has created a flutter among forest authorities. They have started the task of identifying and recording the presence of these birds. Authorities say this is the time for these migratory birds to return to their nesting grounds in Eurasia. It is believed that the birds may be on their way home.
 
 The demoiselle crane, called ‘koonj’ in local parlance, is slightly smaller than the common crane but has similar plumage. It has a long white neck with a black stripe that extends from the fore neck down to its chest.
 
 With the onset of winter in the month of November, migratory birds from colder regions of Eurasia fly to India to roost at different places where they stay till March. This winter, a large number of migratory birds flocked to Bijnor district. They could be spotted at various places, including along river Ganga, Peeli dam, Harevali lake, Sherkot and Afzalgarh.
