MEERUT:   Pratap Singh, 13, often surprises people watching TV with him. During a game of football or cricket, when a country’s team sings their  , Rudra sings along in perfect unison. 

 A student of Class VIII, the teenager has already learnt the national anthems of 18 countries and plans to learn at least 100 by the time he is 21. “He wants to become a pilot when he grows up so he can visit foreign nations and learn their anthems. We first noticed his talent two years ago when, during a football match, the French anthem was being sung. Rudra suddenly stood up and began to sing along. Surprisingly, he knew each and every word and pronounced it with precision,” Rudra’s mother   said. 
 
 Rudra says he was inspired by international ‘anthem girl’  , who holds the Guinness world record for singing 80 national anthems in as many countries. “She did inspire me, but   is not the only reason I learnt these anthems. Actually, I love the sense of pride that people feel when they sing their national anthem. Being able to learn the anthems of other nations makes me feel like a global citizen,” Rudra said.
 
 He particularly likes the Chinese anthem, which he also finds the “most difficult”. The anthems he knows include those of the Philippines, Jordan, the UAE, Japan, Pakistan, Australia, the US, and Israel. “Today, everything is available on the internet and the medium helped me learn the anthems. National anthems must always be sung with utmost respect and correct pronunciation. I always take care of that,” said Rudra, who also has a special liking for complex foreign alphabets.
