CHANDIGARH: The 2018 Panjab   has formed a committee to make the 2018 election process paperless. The university will hold a meeting in this regard with the student council next week after the university reopens. 

 “We are determined to make the election process paperless by next year. We have already constituted a committee of the former dean student welfare (DSWs) and wardens regarding the issue, who have expertise in holding elections, to chalk out a plan to make the elections paperless,” said   of  , Prof Emanual  .
 
 The decision comes after the   and   high court on September 30, 2017 had issued notices to the central government,   ( ) and PU after taking cognizance of a petition seeking paperless student elections in PU. 
 
 The petitioner had sought directions for holding paperless canvassing in the the university elections. He also sought directions to ensure   elections are held without polluting the environment and causing any damage to it. This year, over a 100 cases were registered by police under the Defacement Act around the time of the time of the polls in the university.
 
 Nahar added that making the process paperless would resolve the issue of defacement of public property. 
 
 “With these posters everywhere during the elections, the entire city is defaced. We are trying to devise alternate methods for campaigning during the polls. The students can extensively make use of social media for campaigning. What is the need of posters and pamphlets and other promotional material when you have social media to your rescue? In the meeting with the student council, we are going to discuss about these alternate methods to stop the use of paper completely during the elections,” Nahar added. 
 
 The university is planning to install electronic boards which can be used by student parties for the digital posters and thus cut short on the environmental and monetary wastage.
