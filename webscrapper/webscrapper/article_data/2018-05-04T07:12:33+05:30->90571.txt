JAIPUR/JAISALMER: As many as 24 sites, including iconic monuments,   and cultural sites, have been identified in Rajasthan under the centre's 'Adopt a Heritage' scheme which invites private and public companies, individuals and agencies to adopt the sites and provide basic and advanced amenities and look after the operations. A meeting has been called on May 7 by director general of   (ASI) at Delhi in which officials of the tourism department,   and others will thrash out various options to make the scheme effective by attracting interest from companies and agencies for adoption. 

 While historic sites like Jaisalmer Fort, Nahargargh Fort, Kumbhalgarh Fort and Amber Fort have been named under the Phase 2 and 3 of the scheme, the Phase 4 list has mentioned 12 more projects. Besides, there is also an indicative list of important monuments open for adoption in 2018 and it includes names like Chand Baori, Bhangarh Fort, Mahal Badshahi (Pushkar), Mandore Fort (Jodhpur),   (Bharatpur), Shergarh Fort ( ), Taragarh Fort (Bundi), Deeg Palaces (Bharatpur).
 
 
 
 
 While rolling out the scheme in September last year, the government said that the heritage sites are facing common challenges, primarily related to the creation, operation and maintenance of various infrastructural as well as service assets. There is a need to develop a robust mechanism for the provision of basic amenities on an immediate basis and advanced amenities on a long-term basis.
 
 However, the move has attracted a lot of criticism from the opposition political parties who have accused the government of privatizing the monuments by giving them to corporate or private entities for operation and maintenance.
