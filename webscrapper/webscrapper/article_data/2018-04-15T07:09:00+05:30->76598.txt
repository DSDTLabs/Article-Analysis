 Nearly 100   owned by schools in Greater Noida failed to turn up for the fitness check organised by the transport department near   on Saturday.
 
 While around 600 buses of the Greater Noida schools have been registered with the department, 503 arrived for the check.
 
 Out of these, 46 buses were found unfit for various reasons such as the school’s name/phone number was not written on the bus, rust in the interior, missing   cameras, among others. They have been asked to fix the faults within a week. 
 
 ARTO S K Singh told TOI that they will compile a list of those schools that did not send their buses on Monday.
 
 The department had sent an email to all the schools through the office of the district inspector of schools (DIOS) on Friday. It will organise one last check at the ground behind Prakash hospital in Sector 33 on Sunday for those schools that failed to send their buses.
 
 “Sunday is the last day for schools from both Noida and Greater Noida that failed to send their buses for checking earlier. This will be the last chance following which, the buses of those schools that still fail to abide by the prescribed directions will be seized,” Singh said.
 
 Out of the buses termed as unfit on Saturday, there were some whose gates could not be opened because of rusting in the interior while others did not have CCTV cameras as sought by parents during protests after a child was killed in the Ryan International school in Bhondsi last year.
 
 A total of 1,694 school buses are registered in GB Nagar out of which around 1,000 belong to schools from Noida while the others belong to those in Greater Noida.
