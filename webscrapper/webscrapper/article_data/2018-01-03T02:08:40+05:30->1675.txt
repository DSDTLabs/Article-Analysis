MUMBAI: A total 777 people succumbed to swine flu in Maharashtra in 2017, of which nearly 20 deaths were reported from the city.

 Nearly 1,000 people had tested positive for the viral infection last year from the city. Going by this analysis, the   virus hit the state harder in 2017 than the previous year (2016). Barring 2015 when the virus had claimed the maximum 905 lives, the year gone-by grappled with one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in Maharashtra since 2009.
 
 The virus activity attained two distinct peaks in 2017, indicating its severity in the state last year. According to scientists at Pune-based   ( ), the country’s premier virology research institute, the virus’ transmission was at an all-time high first during summer (March/April) and then during the monsoon period (August/September).
 
 State surveillance officer   said, “India has been witnessing two peaks during transmission seasons in which one of the peaks is slightly more extended than the other one. Only difference last year was that the virus transmission was slightly more extended during both the peaks.”
 
 The scientists pegged the virus’s overall positivity rate at 23% in 2017. It means among the total suspected patients, 23% tested positive for the infection. Pune continued to be the epicentre of the virus activity in 2017.
 
 Since the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the California strain of the virus (influenza A (H1N1) pdm09) had been doing the rounds in the country. Since January this year, however, NIV scientists have been seeing only the Michigan strain of the swine flu virus. Experts said the new strain could be behind the increase in cases and mortality, but it is yet to be proved scientifically.
