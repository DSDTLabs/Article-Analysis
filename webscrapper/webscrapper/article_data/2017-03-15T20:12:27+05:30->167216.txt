ISLAMABAD: In a move that may raise concerns in India, reports suggest that Pakistan is planning to declare the strategic   region also known as Northern Areas as its fifth province.

  Pakistan's minister for inter-provincial coordination Riaz Hussain Pirzada told Geo TV that a committee headed by advisor of foreign affairs   had proposed giving the status of a province to Gilgit-Baltistan.
 
  "The committee recommended that Gilgit-Baltistan should be made a province of Pakistan," Pirzada said on Wednesday.
 
  He also said that a constitutional amendment would be made to change the status of the region, through which the $46 billion   ( ) passes.
 
  The four provinces that are presently under Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
 
  Gilgit-Baltistan shares a geographical boundary with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and India considers it as part of the undivided Jammu and Kashmir, while Pakistan sees it as a separate from PoK.
 
  The USD 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passes through this region, and reports said Pakistan was mulling to elevate the constitutional status of the region in a bid to provide legal cover to the CPEC.
 
  Reports also said China's concerns about the unsettled status of Gilgit-Baltistan prompted Pakistan to change its status.
 
  According to an earlier report in Dawn newspaper, Pakistan was mulling to elevate the constitutional status of the region in a bid to provide legal cover to the CPEC.
 
  The move could signal a historic shift in the country's position on the future of the wider Kashmir region, the paper had quoted experts as saying.
