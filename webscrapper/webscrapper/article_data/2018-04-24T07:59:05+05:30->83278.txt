 Addressing a press conference at Congress Bhavan in  , Batra said, "Be it Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar, Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Kiran Choudhry, party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala or former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, all are mobilising the support of their loyalists and workers to assemble under party chief Rahul Gandhi."
 
 Local Congress leaders associated with former Rohtak MLA B B Batra, former Rajya Sabha MP   and Hooda's loyalists were absent during the press conference.
 
 Attacking the ruling BJP in Haryana and the Centre, he said all Congress leaders had resolved to fight against the saffron party that made big promises but under delivered when it came to job creation, development in villages and other basic facilities to the common man.
