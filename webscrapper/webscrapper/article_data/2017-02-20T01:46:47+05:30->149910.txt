Lucknow: From a local tea-stall to table at high end hotels and in offices of bureaucrats, discussions about who was worth   for have been endless. Finally, after getting inked on Sunday, people in the city had one of the most relaxed holidays.

 With all restaurants, major hotels and hotspots remaining closed till late evening, people looked for innovative ideas to spend the day with their loved ones and TOI caught up with some of them. 
 
 Asim Khan, a businessman who usually spends off days shopping with his kids and watching  , said he retried his old hobby of kite-flying after casting his vote. “I opened up my kite box after almost five years and thankfully, the wind’s direction was also just right,” he said, excitedly.
 
 Seema Mishra, a doctor by profession, utilized her day making an elaborate south Indian meal for the family. “Being a doctor, I hardly get any leaves and when I get one, numerous things are already lined up. Because all markets are closed today, I decided to spend quality time with my family and what’s better than cooking for them,” she said.
 
 A ‘laiyya-chana’ stall in front of Adarsh Public College in Aashiana became a hangout spot for those coming out from the nearby polling booth. Prabhu Daya, the owner of the stall who is from Bahraich, said he had the best sales on the day.
 
 Naveen Sahu, a local who was accompanied by seven family members, said while munching on ‘laiyya-chana’, “After a long time, my family is out together. we will go to some park now and then to Marine Drive for ice-creams.”
 
 Abhinav Mishra, a college-goer, on the other hand, had planned ahead for the day, “I have organized a gaming session with my friends. We have refreshments and some ’90s movies also.”
