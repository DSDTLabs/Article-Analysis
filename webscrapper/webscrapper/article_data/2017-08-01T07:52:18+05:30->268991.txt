HYDERABAD: A new wing will be set up in the state intelligence for mounting surveillance on  ,  . Currently, there is no dedicated unit to track such crimes.

 Hawala funding has been the most popular, yet surreptitious means used by terror handlers in Hyderabad. Not just terrorists, even businessmen, realtors, smugglers, bookies, jewelers and other white collar criminals plough in money through hawala. As a result, government authorities remain in the dark till an accused confesses to investigators about such transactions. 
 
 There are many hawala operators in the city, who have a turnover running into crores. With drug abuse spiraling into a big issue and schoolchildren and cine stars caught in the dragnet, Telangana government directed police to include narcotics as part of antiorganized crime, where a dedicated intelligence set-up is being put in place. In the state in telligence bureau, there are four wings -Counter Intelligence which deals with antiterror activity, Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) for anti-left wing extremism, political intelligence, Intelligence Security Wing (ISW).
 
 â€œSince government wants such a wing to be created for controlling organised crime, we will do it,'' an intelligence officer told TOI. The decision was taken during a recent review meet on drugs probe, adulteration and other issues.
