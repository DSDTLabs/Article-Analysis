MUMBAI: Maharashtra has recorded 696   in the first three months of 2018 between January and March, according to official data. The figure is higher than the 672 cases reported in the same period last year, despite a farm   declared last June.

 
  
  
 
 Of the 696 cases, only 206 or 29% have been declared eligible for compensation so far. These are cases which a state committee links to indebtedness.
 
 The data shows that farmer suicides have risen in the three regions of   (an arid belt),   (the epicentre of the farmers’ strike in 2017) and   (the  ).
 
 
 
  
 
 The Vidarbha region, home to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, continues to report the highest number of farmer suicides, but has seen a decline of 24 cases compared to the same period last year (see box). Both the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions are in the cotton-growing belt, where 80% of the crop was affected by the pink bollworm pest attack last year.
 
 The impact of the loan waiver has yet to kick in with payouts proceeding at a slow rate, say activists. Till March 7, Rs 13,782 crore had been credited into the accounts of 37 lakh farmers, when the final beneficiary list is meant to be 69 lakh farmers. “This slow pace has affected crop loan disbursements as well with banks waiting for the waiver money to come in,” said Ajit Navle from the Kisan Sabha.
 
 Farmer groups stress that the crucial issue of pricing of crops has yet to improve, without which farm incomes will not rise. Officials admit that procurement by the government of crops under the minimum support price has been slow owing to the lack of storage space.
 
 Cotton prices have additionally been impacted by the pink bollworm attack, says activist Vijay Jawandhia. “Good quality cotton is selling at Rs 4,800 but poorer quality cotton is selling at around Rs 2,500. This is the price for 30-40% of cotton sold,” he added.
