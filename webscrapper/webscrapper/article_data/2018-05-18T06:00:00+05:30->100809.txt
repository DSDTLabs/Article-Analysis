Kolkata: The   Collective network comprising citizens’ groups, civil society organizations and farmers’ bodies have labelled the draft National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) a paper tiger without time-bound targets. On Thursday, the collective sent recommendations to the ministry of environment forests & climate change, including introduction of sectoral emission targets and interim milestones.

 Greenpeace India campaigner Sunil Dahiya felt the first and foremost priority for the ministry should be to set time-bound emission targets to reduce air pollution. “NCAP is the ultimate framework to ensure compliance to their commitment towards tackling air pollution from the source. If the document does not have emission and sectoral targets, it makes NCAP not only redundant but pointless,” he said.
 
 Ritwick Dutta of Legal Initiative For Forest & Environment (Life) accused the government of choking the 2015 emission standards for coal-based power plants. 
 
 “NCAP only speaks high words. It neither has any clear strategy nor targets even when pollution is reaching toxic levels across India. The plan is too techno-centric without any target and without any detail on action against violations,” he said. The recent report by World Health Organisation has again put India’s air pollution problem on a global platform. According to WHO, eight of the top 10 most-polluted cities are in India.
