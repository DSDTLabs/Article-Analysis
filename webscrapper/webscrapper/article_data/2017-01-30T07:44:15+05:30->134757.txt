LUCKNOW: The last news about Mahatma Gandhi before his assassination that local Urdu newspapers in Lucknow had printed on January 30, 1948, was about his chance meeting with  's son, at the shrine of Sufi saint   on January 27. After the day's headline recalled Lucknow's connect with the Mahatma through Firangi Mahali, it was in the evening that the news of his assassination rocked the nation.

 It had been months to the partition and the entire country was caught in communal riots when Mahatma Gandhi went on his last fastunto-death asking for the riots to end. With pressure from all sides to end his fast, he laid down five conditions, of which the return of Kaki's shrine to Muslims and that it be repaired by Hindus and Sikhs together was one.
 
 It was here that Gandhi met Maulana Jamal Miyan Firangi Mahali (the son of Bari whom Gandhi referred to as his brother), who recounted the entire meet to newspapers on his return to the city .“Maulana Jamal asked Gandhiji how he knew about Kaki and Gandhiji said that it was, in fact, his father Maulana Bari who had introduced him to Kaki as the disciple of Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer,“ said Adnan Abdul Wali Firangi Mahala, great grandson of Bari, referring to the reported incident.
 
 Explaining, Gandhi had told Jamal how in March 1922 he was invi ted by Bari from Ahmedabad to Ajmer, where he had his first brush with qawwali. “The ghazal being sung was composed by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar and the Bihar secretary of the Khilafat committee, Dr Syed Mahmood was translating it to Gandhiji from Urdu to English,“ said Adnan. In awe of what lay before him, Gandhi enquired from Bari about Chishti's disciple and Bari informed him of Kaki's shrine in Mehrauli, regarded as the spiritual successor of Kaki. Later in 1948, when Gandhiji visited Kaki's shrine, the annual Urs celebrations that had been called off under rioting were reinstated and the Sikhs performed the qawwali under Gandhi's guidance.
