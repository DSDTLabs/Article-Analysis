Panaji: With the nationwide implementation of the electronic way bill or e-way bill set to commence on February 1, the department of commercial taxes urged traders and transporters in the state to ensure that they register with the e-way portal while moving goods worth more than Rs 50,000 between states.

 Once the e-way bill system is implemented, tax avoidance will become extremely difficult as the government will have details of all goods above the value of Rs 50,000 moved and can spot the mismatch if either the supplier or the purchaser does not file tax returns, an official attached to the department of commercial taxes said.
 
 Speaking at the GST Trade Awareness Campaign, commissioner for commercial taxes Deepak Bandekar said that traders and transporters not registered under the GST regime will have to register on the online portal ewaybill.nic.in using their personal Aadhaar number and the company PAN.
 
 “The portal will be live for registrations from January 16 and there are 15 days for traders to register before the e-way bill mechanism comes into force,” Bandekar said.
 
 Traders and transporters will have to also register the vehicle that will transport the goods, but vehicles moving goods for less than 10 kilometers within the state will be exempt, said Bandekar.
 
 The GST provision requiring transporters to carry an e-way bill when moving goods between states will be implemented from February 1 to check rampant tax evasion and boost revenues by up to 20 per cent, according to the central government.
