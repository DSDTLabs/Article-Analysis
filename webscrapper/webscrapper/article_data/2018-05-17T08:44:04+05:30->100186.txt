 Meena is wanted for alleged gross irregularities in the distribution of 35,000 quintals of wheat meant for below poverty line (BPL) families that was sold to private flour mills as DSO, Jodhpur, in March 2016. According to ACB, it is a scam of nearly Rs 8 crore.
 
 Confirming the arrests, DIG (ACB) Ajaypal Lamba, said a woman officer would interrogate Meena.
 
 Meena has been absconding though various courts had successively rejected her anticipatory bail applications. The officer's last hope rested on the SC. But the apex court too rejected her bail plea. She was left with no choice but to surrender before the ACB.
 
 "Since the rejection of bail application, we had been searching for them and raided all the possible hideouts of the officer, but she remained elusive," said Lamba, adding that she surrendered as she had no option.
 
 During ACB's preliminary investigation, the charges against her were substantiated and an FIR was registered for siphoning wheat worth Rs 8 crore.
 
 Besides this, the ACB had registered a separate FIR against the suspended IAS officer and her husband for amassing wealth disproportionate to known sources of income.
 
 The ACB found the couple in possession of 19 immovable assets, which were said to have been amassed by them over the past 10 years.
