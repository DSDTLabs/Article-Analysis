MUMBAI: The   have pushed ahead implementation of their new notification, restricting   and private buses in the city, by 10 days. Officials said they will discuss repercussions of the order with various stakeholders in this period. But bus operators say they will go on a strike until the order is quashed completely.

 A   earlier this week stated that heavy vehicles and private buses would be restricted from plying in   for 17 hours and in   for nine hours. “Nearly 33,000 buses will go off the roads on September 19 and 20 till our demand is met and an assurance is given in writing. The bus strike has not been called off,” an operator said. 
 
 Operators are likely to meet BJP MP   on Saturday to discuss the issue. “We will protest aggressively as it will be difficult to carry on business with so many restrictions that will also inconvenience passengers,” said Malik Patel of the  .
 
 Somaiya, who took a delegation to Mumbai police commissioner Datta Padsalgikar on Friday, said all stakeholders, including bus operators, parking facility providers and BMC, should be taken into confidence before implementing the traffic police order. He added restrictions on vehicle entry into the city should be implemented in phases.
 
 Tourist bus operators have opposed the restrictions on entry of buses, particularly in south Mumbai. The order restricts their movement from 7am to midnight. Tourist bus operators have also demanded that a committee be appointed to look into their pending demands.
 
 If the strike goes ahead as announced, it may paralyse the movement of buses from Mumbai to other parts of Maharashtra and also badly hit inter-state tourist bus services.
