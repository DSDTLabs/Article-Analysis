Chandigarh: A former constable of Chandigarh Police was convicted of demanding Rs 15,000 as bribe from a shopkeeper in Sector 15 for settling a case of cellphone theft in August 2012.

 A special   court here will pronounce the quantum of punishment to be given to Jatinder Singh, who happens to be the son of a police sub-inspector, on Friday.
 
 The CBI had arrested Jatinder red-handed while taking the bribe at his government accommodation at Police Lines, Sector 26. According to the complaint, Jatinder was deployed with the technical cell of Chandigarh Police in August 2012. After a man approached Chandigarh Police over his missing cellphone, Jatinder had tracked the phone to the shopkeeper and started blackmailing him for the money, said the complaint.
 
 After he got tired from harassment at the hands of the cop, the shopkeeper approached the CBI and a trap was laid. When the complainant went to pay him the bribe, Jatinder was nabbed by a CBI team.
