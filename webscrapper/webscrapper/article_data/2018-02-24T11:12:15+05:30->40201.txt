However, membership by working class, farm labourers, middle class and rich   showed an increase. Interestingly, the report admits an increase in membership from the middle class and bourgeoisie sections.
 
 Out of the total membership, 59.4% are from the working class, 25.15% are  , 6.26% are from the peasantry and 8.69% middle class farmers. Rich farmers account for 0.28% members. The middle class has a share of 1.1% of the   and bourgeoisie-landlord section accounts for 0.07%, the report said.
 
 There are 79,757 women members in the party and they account for 17% of the total membership of 4,63,472. Women accounted for 14.5% of the total membership when the last state conference was held in 2014. However, the party has not been able to achieve the target of ensuring that there are at least two women members in all the 32,967 party branches in the state. The leaders said the CPM aims to enhance women’s membership to 25% by the next state conference. There was a drop out of 7% full-fledged members in 2017.
