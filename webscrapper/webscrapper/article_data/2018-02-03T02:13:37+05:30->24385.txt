THANE: India’s first woman private detective, Rajani Pandit, was arrested on Friday for allegedly using illegal means to procure   (CDRs) for her clients. Police had on Thursday busted a gang of detectives and arrested four of them for illegally sourcing and selling  .

 Pandit (54), the daughter of a former police officer, was picked up from her house after one of the arrested detectives, Samresh Jha, told police he had sourced CDRs on her instructions and delivered it to her “for a hefty price”.
 
 A police officer said there was strong evidence to show Pandit had demanded and bought CDRs of at least five people.
 
 Thane police chief Param Bir Singh said, “Pandit’s role has been clearly established in the  . Those involved in the scam, be they from any part of the country, will not be spared.”
 
 Police arrested two other detectives on Friday too — Santosh Pandgale (34) and   (34) — from Navi Mumbai. “Pandit’s statement has been recorded and we are questioning her for any leads in the racket, which seems to be much bigger,” deputy commissioner of police (crime) Abhishek Trimukhe said. 
  
 Police officials said more arrests were likely, citing their find that most detectives brazenly promised their clients CDRs for a big sum. Police have also zeroed in on a Delhi man who was reportedly providing CDRs to the accused.
 
 Meanwhile, police have started a technical analysis of the CDRs seized. A senior officer said they would summon the 177 people to whom they belong.
