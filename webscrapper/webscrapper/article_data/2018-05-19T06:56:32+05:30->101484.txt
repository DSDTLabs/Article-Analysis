GURUGRAM: A black-headed royal   was rescued from   on Thursday. The six-foot-long, non-venomous reptile was the third snake rescued from the area in the last two weeks. It was rehabilitated in the Aravalis.

 The snake was found near a warehouse close to Ramaprastha The Edge, a residential society. People living in the area, which lies along Dwarka expressway and has several housing societies and warehouses, expressed their concern over frequent snake sightings. “We are so scared that we are not sending our children out for playing. There is always the fear of snake bites,” said Rachna Jha, who recently moved to a high rise on Dwarka Expressway.
 
 Rishiraj, another resident, said: “Three snakes, including a cobra, have been rescued from the area in less than 15 days. We have asked security guards to keep an eye out on the boundary walls. However, it is very difficult to ensure that snakes don’t enter the society.”
 
 Interestingly, the black-headed   snake rescued on Thursday is not native to the area. 
 
 “However, it may have come through freight trucks in one of the warehouses. The area has long been a favourite refuge for snakes, it lot of moisture due to presence of a few drains,” said Anil Gandas, wildlife conservationist and founder president of the NGO Environment and Wildlife Society. 
 
 Forest department officials ruled out illegal trade of snakes in the area. Shyam Sunder, district forest officer (wildlife), Gurugram, said: “People have to understand that it is the natural habitat of snakes, we have encroached upon their habitat. As the heat is rising, we will witness more snake sightings. There is no need to panic as most snakes aren’t poisonous. However, there is a need to be careful in case of cobras.”
