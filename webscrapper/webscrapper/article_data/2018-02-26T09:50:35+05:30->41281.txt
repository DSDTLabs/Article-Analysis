PANAJI: The   (IIT), Bombay, has written to the   (GSPCB) stating that in case of a shutdown of   operations at  , the objective of a source appropriation study to quantify emmission contributions from various sources which create air pollution in Vasco will not be met.

 “We have received information that GSPCB has directed   to stop a substantial part of coal handling at the port. My understanding is that the objective of MPT/GSPCB for undertaking the air pollution study was mainly to find out the extent of contribution of coal, if any, in the total pollution load of the Vasco area. In case of the shutdown of operations, this objective will not be met since the sampling will not include the impact of expected sources,” wrote Virendra Sethi of IIT-Bombay said.
 
 The study, at a cost of Rs 94 lakh, is being conducted in view of coal pollution in the port town. 
 
 A senior GSPCB officer said the study is a part of the assurance given by chief minister Manohar Parrikar that a detailed study would be conducted in Vasco to find out the reasons behind air pollution.
 
 The GSPCB officer said the cost of the study would be borne by MPT. The study will be carried out as per Central Pollution Control Board guidelines to ensure the required quality. Its scope includes identification of sampling locations, ambient air quality monitoring, locating pollution sources and source apportionment.
