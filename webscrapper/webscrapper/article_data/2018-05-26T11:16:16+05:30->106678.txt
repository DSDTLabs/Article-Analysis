SHAHKOT: A day after the arrest of former president of Bhikhi block samiti   Singh in a  , the SAD has claimed that the accused was not associated with the party but had joined   in 2016.

 In a statement issued here on Friday, former minister and SAD spokesman   said Pargat had joined the Congress on August 23, 2016 in the presence of chief minister Amarinder Singh.
 
 Grewal said the Congress government had mischievously released details of Pargat’s arrest and branded him as an Akali to take mileage ahead of the Shahkot assembly byelection. “It seems the media was also misled that fell prey to this falsification as it did not verify the facts,” he claimed.
 
 The SAD spokesman said the truth was that Pargat joined the Congress and that event was widely covered by the media. “When the facts of the case have been made clear, the entire issue should be clarified and those spreading such misinformation should be exposed and booked,” he said.
 
 Pargat Singh was arrested while trying to escape after snatching Rs 3 lakh from a farmer on Thursday.
