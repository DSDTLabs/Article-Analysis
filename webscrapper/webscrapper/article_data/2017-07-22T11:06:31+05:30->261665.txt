CHANDIGARH: A gang issuing   is operating in New Delhi, said police after a 26-year-old man turned up at the Chandigarh railway station to join as a commercial clerk (grade III) with a fake appointment letter on Friday.

 Rahul  , a resident of New Delhi, was taken in custody but released later in the evening after it emerged that he was a victim of the gang that surprisingly did not take any money from him — probably a move meant to test the waters.
 
 Officials said Uppal came to the office of the station superintendent at 9.45 am. Suspecting something amiss, his documents were sent to the office of Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) for verification. “In the evening, the DRM confirmed that the documents are fake,” said Ved Parkash, government railway police (GRP) station house officer (SHO). Police registered a case against unknown persons under sections 420 B, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
 T P Singh, superintendent, Chandigarh railway station, said the officials found Uppal’s documents were not according to the norms.  , SHO, railway protection force, said Uppal during interrogation claimed he had not paid any amount to the man who gave him the appointment letter.
 
 When the police approached Central Hospital in New Delhi to verify the medical certificate of Uppal, it was found that the hospital is only for referral cases and has no right to issue any certificate. “In fact, the hospital staff told us that they have received 10 similar enquires about issuing medical certificates in a month,” said the GRP SHO.
