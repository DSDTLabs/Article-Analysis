Nag Ashwin’s   biopic ‘Mahanati’ brought in a big ol’ dose of nostalgia, with everyone wanting to sing and dance to the old tunes that Savitri performed to in her good times. 

  Looks like Ohmkar’s show ‘Sixth Sense’ is jumping onto the bandwagon too seeing as how Geetha Madhuri and   will be doing a ‘Mayabazar’ act in today’s episode. The channel the show airs on posted a promo for the same and wrote on their social media, “Geetha Madhuri does the Ghatotkacha act from   and #Shyamala dances to the tune. #SixthSense..This Sat & Sun at 9:30 PM on Star Maa.” (sic)
 
  In the promo, Geetha Madhuri wears a helmet, welding a hammer like a 
 , she sings the famous song ‘Vivaha Bhojanambu’ that SV Ranga Rao had performed to in ‘Mayabazar’.   and Shyamala look on with amusement as she performs the song complete with SV Ranga Rao’s mannerisms. Later, as the song plays out, Shyamala too joins the revelry and dances to the song with enthusiasm. 
 
  ‘Sixth Sense’ marks Ohmkar’s return to television after his last directorial ‘Raju Gari Gadhi 2’ featuring Nagarjuna and Samantha was a hit. He had revealed previously that he only made his comeback to television purely out of gratitude for the channel that helped him out during his hiatus. He also revealed that while the channel wanted remakes for his return, it was he who wanted something original and had hence pitched the concept of the game show. 
 
  Apart from ‘Sixth Sense’, Ohmkar is said to be working on two scripts – a third instalment of ‘Raju Gari Gadhi’ and another film that will be based on sports. His next is said to be finalised soon in the upcoming months and it remains to be seen if he will continue on with television thereafter. Last week’s episode of ‘Sixth Sense’ saw lyricist Chandrabose on the show crooning songs from ‘Rangasthalam’. It remains to be seen how this week’s episode will be like.
