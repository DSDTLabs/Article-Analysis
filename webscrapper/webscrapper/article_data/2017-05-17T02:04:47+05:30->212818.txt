NEW DELHI: A day after east Delhi MP   raised the issue of PWD unnecessarily replacing the tiles with granite slabs on a   (FOB) at   and requested lieutenant governor   to order an inquiry into it, the department blamed the contractor for not executing the work properly.

 PWD officials said that not all tiles were to be replaced. “It is the contractor’s fault. We had asked him to replace the tiles on the top surface. The staircases were in perfect condition and there was no need to change the tiles. We have asked the contractor to repair the tiles at his own expense,” said a senior official. The department also sought a report from the in-charge of the area in this regard.
 
 Meanwhile, Delhi   chief   visited the spot on Tuesday and alleged that PWD was unnecessarily carrying out the work, as the tiles on the FOB were in good condition. BJP, too, will raise the issue before the LG. “PWD is carrying out undue renovation by removing the anti-skid tiles and replacing them with granite marble slabs,” said Tiwari. The BJP leader said that earlier too, complaints were received regarding roads, drains and footpaths in good condition being damaged so that these could be reconstructed. “The renovation work of FOB speaks volumes about the rampant corruption in the AAP government,” said Tiwari.
