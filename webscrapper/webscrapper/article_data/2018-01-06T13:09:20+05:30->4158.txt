 "FM Jaitley's genius combines with Mr Modi's Gross Divisive Politics (GDP) to give India," tweeted the Congress president.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 The Congress president has been a fierce critic of the "unwise" note ban as well as of the "tardy implementation" of GST, and has said many times that both moves have dented India's growth as well as growth prospects.
 
  
  
 
 Rahul has called GST, 'Gabbar Singh Tax', alluding to an iconic Hindi cinema villain. And his 'fake in India' barb is coined to mock PM Modi's pet 'Make in India' plan, which the Congress president believes has not taken off because of missteps by the government.
