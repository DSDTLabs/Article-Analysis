BENGALURU: Until 3pm, nobody had an inkling that chief minister Siddaramaiah had decided to climb the 700 steps of the   to have a darshan of Lord Bahubali and perform the kalasha abhisheka.

 “He got down from the car at the foothills and as the   (bamboo chair lifted by four persons for those who cannot climb) carriers got ready to ferry him, the CM said he would climb. I’m going to a place where ahimsa is practised. My sitting in a doli and being taken atop the hill is himsa (cruelty),’’ CM’s security SP M V  , who also climbed the hill with him, told STOI after returning to Bengaluru from Shravanabelagola.
 
 His climb comes a day after he stood in the legislative assembly for 4hours, 11 minutes to read out the state budget.
 
 The CM had lunch at   and started the climb at 3.10pm and reached the hilltop at 3.40pm. “He did not take a break or sip water. Initially, we thought he would take a break midway. When we completed three-fourths of the climb, there was a mandated stop for a medical check-up. He sat there for two minutes before continuing,’’ Prasad said.
 
 The CM, accompanied by district administration authorities, local party workers and Kannada and culture minister Umashree is said to have chatted with them along the way. Doli carriers accompanied him as a precautionary measure.
 
 He performed abhishekha to Lord Bahubali. Shravanabelagola mutt seer Charukeerthi Bhattaraka swamiji and   district in-charge minister A   were present. 
 
 Umashree, who has low back pain, climbed the steps and after a while was ferried in a doli. “While coming down, the CM spoke to the doli carriers and asked about their welfare. He asked muzrai department officials accompanying him to pay the doli carriers though he didn’t avail of their services,’’ Prasad said. The CM was applauded by devotees for climbing the hill.
