A number of clinical departments at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) are suffering on account of “poor leadership”, and fail to deliver optimally, feels the faculty forum of the institute.

 Taking up the matter at the general body meet, members said that the problem was caused due to the lack of rotational headship at the departmental level. Besides, the forum also claimed that   had no uniform policy for re-appointment of faculty after superannuation/retirement, referring to the case of two recent re-appointments. 
 
 “Current heads of departments are often not accountable to rest of the faculty. No department meetings take place and unilateral decisions are taken. Due to this, needs of most of the faculty (other than the head) on equipment requirement are not met,” said Prof Ashok Kumar, president of the forum. The meeting was attended by 50 faculty members from various departments of the institute. 
 
 The body uniformly outlined that a rotational headship will be needed to “boost the performance of these departments” and that it was approved by the governing council in 2012. 
 
 The forum said that while SGPGI had no uniform policy of its own, it was surpassing the existing state and central government rules for it. 
 
 Forum questions director 
 
 The faculty forum at SGPGI raised questions against present director Prof Rakesh Kapoor for holding on to both the post of director of the institute and of department head. The forum said holding of more than one administrative post clearly flouts Medical Council of India (MCI) guidelines and rulings of Supreme Court. “This has become a trend at SGPGI with the last five directors having done the same,” said Dr Ansari.
