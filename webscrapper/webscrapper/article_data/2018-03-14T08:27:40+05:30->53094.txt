 Until recently, farmers used to fence their fields with different types of trees preferably with thorns, but now people have started planting bamboo. 
 
 “The advantage of bamboo is that every three years the farmer with a hectare of   on borders could earn as much as Rs 30,000 by sale of bamboo sticks,” district forest officer, Surat, Puneet Nayyar said. This is additional earning for a farmer apart from his regular crop. 
 
 Mainly two types of bamboo grows in this region — manvel and katas. These are low strength varieties. However, many have started planting other varieties like iscova and goagiri that have higher strength and sells at Rs 150 per piece against cheaper variety that fetches Rs 25 per piece. Bamboos are mainly used in construction, handicraft, furniture and some parts of it are used by many for making eat-able items.
