JAIPUR: Rajasthan High Court has asked the   (JDA) to inform the court on Monday the action taken against the JDA officials responsible for   to the post office at   or inform the court of the cost to be imposed on the JDA for its illegal act.

 The single bench of Justice M N Bhandariâ€™s order followed a petition by post master general.
 
 Additional solicitor general R D Rastogi who appeared for the post master general said the JDA allotted 2,517 square meter of land at Vaishali Nagar for post office in 1987. The JDA approved the site plan on condition that only 35% of the said land could be used for construction and the post office was constructed as per the condition.
 
 However, the JDA by an order on January 27 in 2015 cancelled the allotment of 1,668 square meter of land adjoining the post office building. Though the postal department appealed in the JDA tribunal its petition was dismissed on the ground that the JDA had cancelled the allotment for the construction of a parking space in the area.
 
 The post master general then approached the high court. The JDA counsel argued that the allotment was cancelled for violating the site plan approved by the JDA. The court then asked the JDA counsel if the JDA could give an affidavit that all constructions in Jaipur were according to the site plan which he refused. The court then asked to present in the court on Monday at 2 pm with the action taken against the errant officials or what cost it wants to impose on the JDA for its illegal action.
