 Jennifer said she rushed home and locked herself inside to try and process the change in her life. 
 
 Speaking to source , she said, "The day 'The Hunger Games' came out was a bizarre one for me because I wasn't famous 24 hours earlier and I got up to go about my day as usual and went to the grocery store. 
 
 "All of a sudden there were 25 paparazzi following me and there was a three-car pile-up. I was terrified. I went home and locked myself in the house. I couldn't really process anything. Then my doorbell rang and my friends were there with wine and vodka and the things I needed. They came in and we all watched TV and had a normal day, so that was nice."
