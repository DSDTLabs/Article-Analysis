BHOPAL: Students of   college on Monday refused to accept mobile phones given by the state government, terming them as inferior in quality. 

 Incidentally, students in Chhatarpur had also refused to accept such phones recently. The phone distribution scheme was initiated by the state government for government college students who have maintained 75% attendance.
  
  
 Students alleged that the quality of the phones is poor. "It is a smart phone only in name. What will we do with a phone having just two mega pixel and 0.3 mega pixel camera. Besides, the net speed in these phone is less than 2G and the battery back-up is poor," said students' representative Asma Khan. 
 
 As soon as the programme for phone distribution started, students boycotted the function. Students were so angry that they even locked the teachers inside the classrooms. Students were demanding 4G phones. 
 
 "The government is willing to give phones for studies. In the age of 4G, what will we do with 3G phones. If government is not able to afford 4G, then atleast they should give us better quality 3G phones," said Khan. 
 
 Students also alleged that the market price of phone is just Rs 700. "We were told that the market price of the phones which we were supposed to get us was Rs 2500. The matter should be probed," said Khan. Students alleged that better quality phones were given to their seniors in 2016. "Branded 3G phones were distributed. Why such partiality? We can accept the phones which were given to our seniors in the past," said another student. In 2016, the government had ordered 3.75 lakh handsets, each costing Rs 2159.75 from a Hyderabad-based company for their distribution among students, sources said. 
 
 Realising that the situation was going out of control, the college officials stopped the phone distribution. 
 
 Students said they will oppose the distribution which is scheduled on March 8 if the same phone is given to them.
