LUDHIANA: After a long tussle for over a month, leaders of Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) have finally reached a consensus on the number of wards. On Saturday in a late evening meeting, senior party leaders reached the conclusion that both parties would jointly contest in the   polls. However, LIP will get more benefits, as there will be more wards in their kitty.

 Leaders of both parties — Sukhpal Khaira, Bhagwant Mann,  ,  , Balwinder Bains, and other leaders — were present in the meeting on Saturday, which continued until 10pm. The apple of discord was distribution of wards from East constituency. The leaders, however, claimed that most issues were now sorted out, and very shortly, AAP leaders would release the list of final candidates from Chandigarh.
 
 Sources revealed that a consensus was arrived at on the basis of seat sharing in the assembly polls. LIP had fielded candidates from four constituencies like Atam Nagar, South, North, and Central, while AAP had contested from two constituencies of East and West. The AAP will contest on more than 35 seats, while LIP will get a chance to contest on more than 55 seats. The official announcement will be made on Monday.
 
 Meanwhile, AAP co-president Aman Arora said they had finalized everything, but at the moment, he could not disclose the exact number of wards on which AAP would contest the MC polls. He said they would release the list in a day or two, but the winability of candidates would be top priority. However, LIP MLA and party head Simarjit Bains also stated they had overcome all the issues, and both parties had distributed seats among candidates. 
 
 As soon as consensus was arrived at among party heads, the probable candidates from LIP started their activities related with polls. One of the candidates from ward 90, Rajesh  , got his office inaugurated by Bains in New Kundanpuri. He also got a rally organized in the area to lure voters.
