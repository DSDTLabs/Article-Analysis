PUNE: Dejected after a woman declined his proposal of love, a   from Vimannagar decided to exact revenge on her by  .

 However, police exposed the plot and solved the case within 24 hours.
 
 A team headed by senior inspector Sanjay Naik-Patil and inspector Vilas Sonde of the Airport police picked up the youth, Avinash Devram Vairagar, from the   on Friday night.
 
 On Thursday night, unidentified persons began calling Vairagar’s friends stating they had kidnapped him.
 
 Naik–Patil told TOI that his friends rushed to the police station on Thursday night around 11pm and informed police of the incident. “Vairagar’s friends had recorded the calls that were made on their smart phones,” he said.
 
 After a while, Vairagar’s mother also rushed to the police station, Naik-Patil said.
 
 The police team immediately began working on the leads in the case and realised that Vairagar’s ‘alleged kidnappers’ had mentioned a youth based in Solapur. Police soon managed to contact the Solapur-based youth but they found out that he was not behind the kidnapping.
 
 After this, police realised the kidnappers were roaming near the Pune railway station. A team rushed to the area and found Vairagar alone. Police took him to the station and quizzed him, when he confessed the truth.
 
 Naik-Patil told TOI that Vairagar is a flower decorator and takes orders to decorate wedding ceremonies, parties and other venues. 
 
 “Vairagar, who has completed his HSC studies, saw a woman at a party organised in a star hotel in Vimannagar. The two started interacting with each other and Vairagar made advances towards her. The woman politely declined them,” Naik-Patil said.
 
 Later, Vairagar spotted her with a friend, the youth from Solapur, and thought something was going on between them. 
 
 “He then decided to stage his own kidnapping to trouble the woman and her friend,” Naik-Patil said.
 
 The woman has done her MBA and works in a private firm in the city.
