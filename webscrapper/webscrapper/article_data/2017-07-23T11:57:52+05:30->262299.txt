THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even though many   in the past were   in  , not many   were arrested for involving in other criminal cases.

 In 2002, Chengannur MLA Sobhana George was arrested during the regime of A K Antony government for forging a document against the then minister K V Thomas. Like Vincent, Sobhana too represented Congress. Other MLAs who were arrested while serving as legislators include chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He was jailed during the Emergency.
 
 Thalassery MLA M V Rajagopalan Nair was jailed in 1980 after being awarded a life sentence by the trial court in the murder of RSS activist Kunnothuparambu Ravindran. There are several MLAs who were involved in sleazy sex scandals, but none of them quit their post as legislator. But, ministers from P T Chacko to A K Saseendran had to quit their post when sexual allegations were levelled against them.
 
 A Neelalohitadasan Nadar, P K Kunhalikutty, P J Joseph and K B Ganesh Kumar were other ministers who had to quit following their involvement in crimes against women. Janata Dal (S) leader Jose Thettayil, who represented Angamaly in the previous assembly, had faced rape charges. He evaded arrest after procuring anticipatory bail from the high court.
 
 Though there was clamour for his resignation from the LDF, his party decided against the resignation. Thettayil, however, was not given a ticket to contest in last year's election by his party leadership. Nadar was also denied a ticket by JD (S) after he was involved in a sexual harassment case.
