Chennai: While the city can finally be relieved as Chennai’s two-year-long dry spell has finally drawn to an end, little has changed for residents in the outskirts.

 More than a year after Metrowater completed laying close to 300km of pipeline in Ambattur and Korattur, 8,578 households continue to wait for water.
 
 Suresh S, general secretary, Federation of Ambattur Residents’ Welfare Association, is among them. “I got my Metrowater connection in August, 2016, but we have got more assurances than water,” he said, adding that residents have, however, been paying water tax for the last two years despite now having water.
 
 During last year’s drought, Ambattur was among the worst affected with the groundwater level plummeting by up to 3metres compared to 2016. “Most of us buy water from Metrowater through tankers. If the wait is too long we rely on private tankers,” said T Nalendran who stays in Poompuhar Nagar, around 10km away from Puzhal lake. Private water tanker operators say although demand for water from them across the city has fallen with Metrowater stepping up supply and the recent rains boosting groundwater tables, business continues to be brisk in Ambattur. “The area is rich in groundwater. The problem is many of the tanker operators source water from here. In some instances they sell the water back to the locals,” said a private operator in Vanniar street, Ambattur. 
 
 Metrowater officials said although the project was completed last year, they were unable to start supply owing to the drought. “The delay now is because we are disinfecting the new pipes,” said the area engineer. He said a few pockets in Ambattur and Korattur would get Metrowater supply before Pongal. “The rest will get as and when we finish the cleaning process,” said the engineer.
 
 Metrowater will source 300 million litres of water per day from Puzhal lake to cater to more than 8,000 households in Ambattur and Korattur.
