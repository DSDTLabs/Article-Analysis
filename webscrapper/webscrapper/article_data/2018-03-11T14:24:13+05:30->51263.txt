  The actor said, as a parent, she believes empathy is the most important lesson that needs to be taught to children. 
 
 "To value others. If you live life and walk around thinking of yourself and your own needs and desires then not only is it a selfish life, but it ends up being quite an unhappy life, I imagine. And that's where everything goes wrong. The wars and hostility, the ugliness and inhumanity in this world comes from this lack of being able to have real empathy for someone else. 
 
 "If you can value others, I think things naturally balance out in your own life. When you don't live with ignorant perceptions and that smallness, you open up in a beautiful way," she said.
