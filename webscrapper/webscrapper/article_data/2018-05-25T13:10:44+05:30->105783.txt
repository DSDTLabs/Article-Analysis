VADODARA: A fire broke out in the textile engineering department of MS University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) on Thursday morning.

 Fire department officials said the fire was sparked due to heating of an internet switch in the passage outside weaving laboratory of the department. As the fire came to the notice, the fire department was informed. Firemen from   fire station doused the fire within few minutes as the blaze had not spread to adjoining laboratory and cabins of three teachers in the same passage. Since the fire broke out at around 8.30am, there was no chaos as the staff was not present.
 
 However, the smoke and flames charred the walls and ceiling of the passage. Many waste documents and papers that were kept in one corner of the passage were gutted.
 
 “The papers and documents that got burned were not important. The teachers of the department also verified them and found that these were waste,” said professor  , dean of FTE.
