PANAJI: The   ( ) on Tuesday denied having ever offered the chief ministerial berth to Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) senior leader   alias Sudin in return for a merger.

 Dhavalikar, who is the chief ministerial candidate of the   (GSM)Shiv Sena alliance, had on Monday said that defence minister Manohar Parrikar had offered to put him at the helm of the state’s administrative affairs if he were to merge the regional party with the BJP.
 
 BJP media cell co-convener Premanand Mahambre said Dhavalikar’s statement was “totally false and malicious, and was made to create a sensation and raise his value in the eyes of the electorate”. The saffron party claimed that the former PWD minister’s only aim was to retain his party to somehow gain access to power by aligning with the party that wins the election.
 
 “This party has no principle, programme or cadre. It is apparent that it has been on a spree of distributing nominations to those who have never even been part of the outfit,” Mahambre added.
