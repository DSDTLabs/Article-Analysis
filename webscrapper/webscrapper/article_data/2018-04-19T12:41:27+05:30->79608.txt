LUDHIANA: You will now have to   out more when applying for an arms licence or renewal of an old one. The health department, on Wednesday, increased the applicants’ medical examination fee from Rs 500 to Rs 1,500 to include   charges. 

 Senior medical officer Dr Geeta said, “After receiving the state government orders to recover the charges from applicants, the health department implemented the new fee structure Tuesday onwards. For dope test, the applicants will be examined for morphine, codeine, D propoxyphene, benzodiazepines, 9-tetra hydro cannabinol (THC), barbiturates, cocaine, amphetamines, buprenorphine and tramadol.” 
 
 The state government had recently issued instructions that before issuing an arms licence, dope test must be conducted on applicants to check if they are dependent on any intoxicating or narcotic substance. The government imposed the rule about one-and-a-half years after the Union ministry of home affairs and justice notified it in 2016.
 
 Civil surgeon Dr   said, “Dope test kits have reached civil hospital. Expert doctors will check blood and urine samples. The test will be conducted on Tuesday and Thursday.” 
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (licences)   said, “Now onwards, those seeking arms licence or renewal of an old one will first have to go for a dope test at civil hospital. After that, the police department will take their documents. Around 15,822 arms licencees are registered in Ludhiana district. Every month, we receive 700-800 applications. The fee for new arms licence is Rs 2,000. For renewal, it is Rs 1,500.”
