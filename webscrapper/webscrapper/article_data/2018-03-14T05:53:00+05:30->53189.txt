Chennai: Two units of Vallur thermal plant has been shut down due to technical problems. Tangedco receives nearly 750MW from these two units as part of a joint venture with NTPC. The units are likely to restart power generation only after two days and Tangedco will be poorer by more than 1000MW as apart from Vallur, one unit of Kudankulam nuclear reactor has been shut down. 

 The demand is hovering around 14800MW and due to a cyclonic storm in the bay, wind power generation has picked up to the extent of more than 1000MW. “Vallur units are likely to back only on Thursday. While one unit is due to boiler tube burst and another unit due to some electrical problem,” said a senior Tangedco official. 
 
 Both the units of Kudankulam were down and the first unit has re-started power generation but only to the extent of less than 250MW. “We were informed that the second unit will re-start power generation only after May 15. Unit 1 has not reached the full capacity and we get less than what has been allocated to us,” he said. 
 
 Though commencement of wind season is more than a month away, Tangedco has been fortunate to have wind power generation now. “Last evening the total wind power evacuation touched 1800MW and since then the average has been not less than 1300MW. Along with this we get solar power during day time. Renewable power has come in handy to compensate the loss of thermal and nuclear power,” he said. 
 
 Two units of Kudankulam have become infirm power and Tangedco finds it difficult to forecast its supply schedule. “The load despatch centre is more or less not taking Kudankulam into consideration for forecasting its supply schedule. When ever we get power from the two units, it is a bonus,” said the official.
