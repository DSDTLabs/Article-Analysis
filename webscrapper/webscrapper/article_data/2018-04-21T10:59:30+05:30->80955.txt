NAGPUR :Corporators Asha Uike, Darshini Dhawad and   on Friday alleged that marriage and private functions are regularly organized on  , parks and open spaces depriving children of playing areas.

 Mayor Nanda Jichkar directed the administration to initiate action against the violators and free the open spaces for playing.
 
 Uike said NMC was not taking any action despite marriage and private functions being held on Muslim ground meant for football in her ward in Central Nagpur. “The violators are even earning by charging hefty amount for the area,” she said.
 
 Uike handed over the complaint along with pictures to Jichkar in the House.
 
 Dhawad said people residing near Green Park at Friends Colony in West Nagpur complained about marriage and private functions going on in the garden unabatedly.
 
 Gwalbanshi, along with former mayor Maya Iwnate, demanded shifting of green gym from the middle of Green Park to one of the four corners.
 
 Opposing the move, Dhawad said people demanded green gym in the middle of the Park. Corporator Harish Gwalbanshi too supported Dhawad.
 
 Gwalbanshi said public utility (PU) lands situated in layouts in his ward were falling prey to similar marriage and private functions. Corporator Praful Gudadhe said NMC was developing parks on playgrounds violating the norms.
 
 Municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal said only 15% of the playground area can be permitted for construction purpose, that too related to sports. “Even development of parks cannot be allowed on playgrounds. I will see whether any such work orders were given recently,” he said.
