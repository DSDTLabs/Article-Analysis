PURULIA: Police claimed on Sunday that the death of Dulal Kumar (30), a   worker found hanging from a high-tension electric transmission tower in Purulia’s Dabha the previous day, was due to suicide as per the autopsy report.

 
 “A post-mortem was conducted by a team of five doctors on Saturday. We received the report on Sunday. It clearly says death was due to asphyxia, due to hanging, ante-mortem and suicidal in nature. We wanted to share the (post-mortem) findings so that no confusion remains. Further inquiry is on,”   SP Akash Magharia told reporters.
 
 Magharia’s immediate predecessor Joy Biswas had claimed on Saturday that preliminary investigations suggested the death was a case of suicide. Biswas was later transferred to State Armed Police.
 
 Kumar’s family claimed Trinamool Congress goons were behind the murder. “My husband was killed by Trinamool goons due to political rivalry because he had joined BJP seven months ago and led the party to victory in the village booth,” his widow Monica said. She repeated her allegations on Sunday to a state BJP delegation. She even pleaded that the killers be hanged.
