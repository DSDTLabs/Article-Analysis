LUCKNOW: Amid reports that after desertion of two MLCs, there were a few more fence-sitters, including some senior leaders of the party,   Akhilesh Yadav had decided to adopt a wait-and-watch approach. According to sources close to him, the former chief minister has decided to wait till SP’s national convention in September, when his position as the national president would be rectified formally.

 “By then most of the black sheep would have left the party, giving an opportunity to   to reorganise the outfit,” says a legislator close to the former CM, who has been hinting that those hobnobbing with the   have no place in SP. For the record, the   leadership has downplayed the resignations of two MLCs. “They had no mass base and were surviving on the party’s doles. Their departure will make no difference,” a member of Team Akhilesh told TOI. 
 
 As compared to the SP, the loss is substantial for the BSP. Thakur Jaiveer Singh, the former minister, who quit the party on Saturday, is a leader with mass support in and around Aligarh. Although he lost his seat in 2017, he won thrice before that. Besides, his wife was Aligarh MP between 2009 and 2014. 
 
 “At present, we are focusing on rebuilding the organization through membership drive and formal election of its national office- bearers. Besides, we are keeping a close watch on those who are working or speaking against the interest of the party to identify them before the convention,” a party leader said. Another challenge that has cropped for the SP is BJP’s vigorous effort to win over its core Yadav voters. The convention will also focus on this. 
 
 The Akhilesh camp has criticized his uncle and party MLA Shivpal Yadav for discussing the family issue in public. “Had his intentions for the family unity been really true, he would have discussed within the family and not through the media,” retorted a close aide of Akhilesh Yadav.
