Ludhiana: If you are planning to travel somewhere and is in a hurry to book the tickets, then you might be left disappointed if you end up at the reservation counter towards Civil Lines of Ludhiana railway station. Unfortunately, due to severe shortage of staff at the local station, the railway authorities failed to start the reservation counter at Civil Lines.

 Though there is a reservation counter, the railway authorities had planned to open another reservation counter towards Civil Lines to tackle the heavy rush of passengers during summer. However, several months have passed on, but the railway authorities have failed to start the counter at Civil Lines.
 
 Station superintendent Ashok Salaria cites staff crunch as one of the major reasons behind the delay. “We will take up this matter with the senior authorities of Ferozpur division and bring the matter to their notice to appoint staff for the new reservation counter,” said Salaria. He also said, “In general, there is no need of reservation counter towards Civil Lines but in summer, there is a heavy rush of passengers and it becomes difficult for one reservation counter to handle the crowd. We will take the decision soon.”
 
 Speaking on condition of anonymity, a railway official said that earlier the authorities had decided to open a reservation center towards Civil Lines, because footfall increases during the summer season and it becomes difficult for one reservation counter to manage the heavy rush issue.
 
 Rakesh Kumar, daily commuter, said, “Ludhiana is one of the biggest stations in north India and almost 50,000-60,000 people visit the station daily. The authorities should be proactive on this issue and should have opened the reservation counter on Civil Lines side by now.”
