New Delhi: The   has set an example by “punishing” its sanitation chief and six other senior officials for dereliction of duty in the dengue control programme. Their salaries have been   and disciplinary action initiated. 

 To plug loopholes in the domestic breeding checking system, all the head of the departments have been told to submit “selfies” clicked in houses they have visited on a daily basis. An online complaint system is being worked out, which will have details of homes visited by each domestic breeding checker (DBC). The officers who were penalised on Tuesday are the DEMS chief (sanitation), one deputy commissioner, three executive engineers, one deputy director (education) and an additional director (education).
 
 Earlier, commissioner Mohanjeeet Singh had assigned two wards each to all senior officials and constituted 32 teams. The move was aimed at monitoring the work of 1,200 DBCs and field workers—the first line of defence against mosquito-borne disease in the city. “Beginning April 2016, each DBC headed by HODs were mandated to visit these wards and check that anti-mosquito drive is being carried out properly. But the officials displayed lack of seriousness ,” said a senior EDMC official.
 
 The commissioner has asked the director of IT department to revamp the online system. “Residents will be able to lodge online complaints by uploading pictures or videos of mosquitoes breeding sites and our employees will visit the house,” said Yogender Mann, spokesperson of EDMC.
