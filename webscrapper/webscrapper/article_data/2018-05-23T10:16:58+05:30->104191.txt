JAIPUR: Last year Rajasthan received Rs 352 crore from   (RUSA) for the development of higher education in the state. However, this year the government is sending a proposal of only Rs 189 crore as many universities and colleges are not up to the standards set by   for grant of funds. This has raised questions at the level of higher education in Rajasthan.

 RUSA, this year, has attached the funding to the universities and colleges according to the grades provided by   (NACI). Hence, for Rs 100 crore grant the university should have 3.51 and above grade and for Rs 20 crore grant 2.51 and above grade. In Rajasthan there are no universities with such grade to receive this amount.
 
 MC Sharma, the vice-chairman of higher education council said that they have drafted the proposal keeping in mind different requirements of the colleges. “We have requirements for different colleges and universities across the state. Our proposal also includes infrastructure development of professional colleges in the state. For development of research, innovation quality in  , Jaipur and  , Udaipur we have asked for Rs 50 crore. We are trying our best to get the funds for excellence in the higher education but whether this proposal will be accepted will be decided in the upcoming meeting” said Sharma.
 
 Lack of research facilities, infrastructure problems, faculty shortage are considered to be some of the reasons of decline of higher education standards in Rajasthan. RUSA’s second-phase meeting on May 24 will decide the fate of this proposal.
