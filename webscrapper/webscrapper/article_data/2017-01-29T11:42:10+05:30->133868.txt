While rejecting the application, additional district and sessions judge N L Dave said that the applicants have a criminal antecedent and they are also involved in other serious offences. 
 
 Rajesh, Sunny and Kanku had attacked Galsar while the latter tried to stop the truck in which the trio were travelling. They were carrying wooden pieces in their truck and since Rajesh was driving in a rash manner, the pieces were falling on the road. Galsar who was patrolling in the area intercepted them in a PCR van.
