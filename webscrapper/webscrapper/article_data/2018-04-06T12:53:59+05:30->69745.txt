TRICHY: Issues relating to station development, including passenger amenities, security of passengers and establishing two-wheeler parking facilities took centrestage at the meeting of the  , which was held here on Thursday.

 Member of the Railway Station Consultative Committee and auditor   while listing out the requirements for the   station said that destination boards fixed on various express trains were confusing the passengers and that they should be properly mentioned on the trains.
 
 Mohan also appealed to the assistant commercial manager and station master to introduce trolleys, at least on a trial basis as women and senior citizens are finding it difficult to carry their luggage.Mohan and another member   expressed displeasure over the practice followed at the junction where passengers arriving by an autorickshaw or car are blocked midway by placing barricades. Thus, they are forced to walk for more than 100m to reach the station building.
 
 The members opposed the railway authorities for allowing only a few inside while making other passengers, particularly women and senior citizens walk from a distance and asked the officials to treat all the passengers alike without any disparity.
 
 Mohan further stated that it was not acceptable to collect Rs 30 per head for using the battery car. “It was initially introduced only to help senior citizens to reach their platforms. However, to make revenue from each and everything, the railway authorities have started to collect Rs 30 per head from elderly passengers also. That should be stopped and they should be allowed to use the battery car free of cost”, he added.
