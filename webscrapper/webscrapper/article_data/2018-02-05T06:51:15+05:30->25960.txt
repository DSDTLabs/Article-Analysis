COIMBATORE: A day after Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) sleuths arrested the vice-chancellor of  , A  , for accepting a bribe of Rs 30 lakh from an assistant professor, syndicate members and members of the teachers’ association said they suspect irregularities in other appointments made by him.

 A source from the   said the association would demand that a body be constituted under a sitting high court judge to conduct an independent probe into all appointments made by Ganapathi.
 
 
 A senior syndicate member said there have been several violations in appointments under SC/ST quota and backlog vacancies in the university. “Also, of the 80-odd recruitments made by him, almost 90% are irregular,” he said. A special syndicate would be convened within a week to discuss the further course of action, he said.
 
 In the past, several controversies had broken out around the appointments made by Ganapathi. In November 2016, around 80 appointments made by him were under a spot, with education department officials saying he went ahead with the appointments in spite of being asked by the department to put them on hold.
 
 In December 2016, the appointment of S   as the director of the school of management studies raised several questions. As per UGC rules, only those who had been a professor for five years could be appointed as a director. But Saravana Kumar was an associate professor. The university, however, said it had taken into account his previous experience in appointing him.
 
 Last year, N  , who had sought the post of an assistant professor in the biotechnology department in 2016, claimed that though she was eligible for the post, the university appointed another person to the post. The appointment was irregular, she had claimed. Based on Prabha’s complaint last November, Vadavalli police registered an FIR against Ganapathi under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act 2015.
