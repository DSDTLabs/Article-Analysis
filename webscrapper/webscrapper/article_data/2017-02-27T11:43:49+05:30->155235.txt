DHARAMSALA: The temple authorities of the Kangra region are in process to implement   for pilgrims visiting shrines here.  , one of the 25 shaktipeeths of the country, would be doing the same before   next month.

 Sub-divisional magistrate, IAS Debsweta Bainik, told TOI that the temple trust has passed the resolution with a view to promote safety and tourism at pilgrimage places. “Machines would be installed to issue barcode access card having all the details of the visitors. This would enhance the security measures,” she said.
 
 Further adding to this, Bainik said that people usually keep standing in long queues during peak tourist season which would be eased with this step. “With access cards, visitors will be kept informed about their turn and they can visit other areas and make proper use of their waiting time rather than standing in queues,” she added. Moreover, this measure will help authorities to control an overcrowded situation. 
 
 It is for the first time that any pilgrimage place here has proposed this measure. Officials are of the view that this would also enable them to keep exact record of the visitors. In case, in any year the number comes down, the data would also help authorities to frame policies.
 
 Kangra has three shrines, namely Chamunda Devi, Brajeshwari Devi and Jawala Devi, which attracts hordes from across the globe. Brajeshwari Devi is visited by various sects from Sikhs, Hindus and few of Muslims. 
 
 Brajeshwari trust has recently passed this resolution in meeting and was pending before the government for a formal approval. “We are hopeful that the same would be implemented before Navratras this year,” said Bainik
