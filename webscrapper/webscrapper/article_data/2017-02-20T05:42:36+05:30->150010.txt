TAMLUK: In an effort to augment revenue, the   government has hiked   mutation charges, varying from 40% to 100% with a further incremental increase depending on land sizes. The minimum increase in land   charges has been made in respect of agricultural land, the biggest jump has been earmarked for commercial properties.

 The formal notification now made public in the BLLRO offices state-wide appears to resonate the erstwhile Left Front government’s intent to hike land mutation prices back in 2005. The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government had stopped short of doing so. Therefore, the rate change, according to sources, comes at a 12-year lag.
 
 These sources indicate the land demarcation under the rules remains the same. It covers rural swathes of Bengal, municipality areas which do not fall under the KMDA and lastly the KMDA areas. The land mutation fees has been structured under three broad heads — agricultural land, non-agricultural and non-commercial land or homestead land and commercial land.
 
 The new hike, effective from February 2017, increases the mutation rates across all spectrum. The biggest surge, however, has been kept aside for the commercial plots. 
 
 A senior state official argued, “A cursory glance may indicate a huge increase. But this is far from being so. For the last decade the land mutation charges have been stagnant. In this period the land prices have increased manifold. The attempt is to make the land mutation charges proportional to the much higher property values.” However, detractors indicate that the   ruled   has been reluctant to increase the land mutation charges, where the similar logic is applicable.
 
 The official also argued that flat land mutation rates have been kept for agricultural and homestead land state-wide and incremental charges are only applicable to KMDA areas hemming Kolkata.
