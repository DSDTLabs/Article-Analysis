GURUGRAM: On Thursday, the maximum   touched 26 degrees Celsius in the city. So, while people are in a fix, Met department has blamed the approaching western disturbance and change in wind direction for the rise in mercury. 

 The weatherman says Gurugram is getting warmer winds from Rajasthan instead of Jammu and Kashmir.
 
 However, starting Monday, temperatures are likely to dip slightly as cloud cover will persist leaving little way for the sun to warm up the region, according to the MeT department. TOI recently reported that January was the warmest in NCR in 12 years.
 
 “There are three reasons for the rise in temperature in the NCR, including Gurugram,” an official at the Regional   Forecasting Centre told TOI.
 
 “Firstly, a western disturbance (WD) is making its way into the region. Generally, WD leads to the warming up of temperatures initially before we see any precipitation. The north westerly winds that bring the chilly conditions from states like Jammu and Kashmir have been replaced by south-westerly winds bringing in air from Rajasthan that happens to be warmer,” he said.
 
 “Secondly, there have been clear skies over the last few days, so the sun charges itself with full force with little obstruction. And thirdly, from the perspective of climatology, since January 26 has just gone by, we are likely to see an increasing trend in the temperature,” the official added.
