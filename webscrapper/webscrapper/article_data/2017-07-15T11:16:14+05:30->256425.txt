VADODARA: A city-based school has decided to terminate services of a physical education (PE) teacher cum karate trainer who had punished students of standard four on Friday. 

 The teacher had punished around ten students by asking them to put their heads down during the PE class at Bright Day School’s Vasna unit (  board). 
 
 According to sources, the teacher who was taking the classes asked a couple of students to put their heads down for unknown reasons. 
 
 When some of them resisted the punishment, they were allegedly beaten up by the teacher identified as Dhairya Dalal. 
 
 School principal   admitted that she has received the complaint from 12 students. 
 
 “As soon as, we received the complaint from the students, we decided to terminate services of this teacher who had started conducting the classes just four days back,” she said. 
 
 Gandhi said that Dalal is a temporary teacher who was hired as a replacement for school’s regular PE teacher   who recently underwent a surgery. 
 
 “I informed the school trustees about the complaint raised by the students and they too have agreed that we cannot tolerate any such behaviour from any teacher,” she said, adding that the school has well laid down rules which don’t allow teachers to punish children. 
 
 Agitated parents, who were informed about the incident by their wards after they reached home, have decided to make a representation against the teacher on Saturday. 
 
 Although some of the parents suggested that the teacher had used sticks to beat up the kids, Gandhi said that the complaint that she has received does not suggest that the kids were beaten up with sticks. 
 
 “In any case, we will not tolerate this and we have already taken an apology letter from the teacher who will be relieved at the earliest,” she said.
