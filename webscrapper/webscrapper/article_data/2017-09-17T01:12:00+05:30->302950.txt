Lucknow: Residents of Old City areas comprising KGMU, City Station, Aminabad, etc will have to wait longer for the speedy transport because the new   Rail Policy 2017 requires revision of the detailed project report (DPR) for Lucknow Metro’s second phase, the ‘East-West Corridor’. 

 This is the third time the DPR of E-W corridor will be prepared. Earlier, Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation ( ) had planned to begin construction by 2018 but going by the strict norms of the new policy, revision of the report is expected to take much longer and in turn push the construction work further. 
 
 The E-W corridor from Vasantkunj to Charbagh is about 12km long and will run mostly underground because of the congested lanes of Old City. The stretch was planned in the second phase after the DPR was approved. But since the DPR was prepared in 2013, LMRC felt need to revise the corridor in 2016.
 
 Officials said, “The E-W corridor is an integral network of Lucknow Metro, which will connect Charbagh to the Old City. But since the DPR had become old, we felt need to survey all over again the locations, surrounding areas, population and properties affected, etc, to see if the DPR should be revised. We had given our inputs for change in DPR to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in mid-2016.”
 
 DMRC was working as interim consultant for LMRC while DPR was being prepared. It played an integral role in deciding the route of E-W corridor, so after conducting the survey in 2016, LMRC sent its feedback to DMRC. With the new Metro policy, the E-W corridor DPR needs to be revised, incorporating all guidelines of the policy.

 LMRC ran five trains on Saturday
 
 Expecting good ridership during weekend, LMRC launched five trains on the the newly launched priority section of Lucknow Metro, to run at a gap of 10-11 minutes each. But since ridership was not as good as expected, it ran the fifth train only during the busy morning and evening hours.
