LUDHIANA: Days after TOI raised the issue of   fixed on vehicles of high-ranking officials despite the ban, the officials got these safety guards removed from their cars. But the issue does not end there itself. Despite the ban, sale of these guards is still going on unchecked in the city. One can easily purchase these crash guards for their vehicles from car accessory shops at Model Town and  .

 When TOI spoke to such shop-owners, they said the crash guards were still being sold from Rs1,500 onwards, going up to Rs5,000. People are complaining that imposing a challan is of no use when the sale is still on. “People will keep putting the guards on their vehicles as long as they are being sold in the market, and police obviously can’t trace each and every vehicle in the city with these guards. Imposing a challan would be justified only if the sale of these guards is stopped too,” said Dugri resident  .
 
 “I think there should be an equal amount of challan imposed both on people using these guards on their vehicles, and shop owners still selling them, despite knowing they are banned. If police keep imposing challans only on people using the guards, it will be of no use since the sale of these guards will still be on. To make the ban more effective, police should check the shop-owners as well,” said South City resident Harinder Singh.
 
 Some people say the police should get these guards removed from vehicles of officials. “There are still many vehicles of officials who have these crash guards on them. Many police patrol vehicles too have these guards. If they themselves aren’t removing them, how do they expect people to do it? They should first get them removed from their vehicles before asking people,” said Sector-35 resident Navjot Singh.
