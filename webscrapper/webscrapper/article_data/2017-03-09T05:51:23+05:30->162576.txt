ABOHAR: In a new twist in the Bhim   case, the last and the fourth key  ,  , appeared in court and stuck to his earlier statement that Bhim died after a brutal attack by the “henchmen” of   and politician Shiv Lal Doda. With this, Ajay has become the only associate of the Dalit youth killed on December 11, 2015, who has not turned hostile in the case.

 Earlier, the other key prosecution witnesses — Gurjant Singh, Ranjit Singh Rana and his uncle Jaspal Singh Bhola — had claimed in court that Bhim was not attacked by Doda’s henchmen and the crime took place in a building next to his farmhouse in Ramsara village near Abohar.
 
 Bhim’s murder had rocked the state and the country in December 2015 because of the brutality with which he and Gurjant, alias Janta, were attacked. The attackers had chopped off the arms and legs of Bhim and he died midway to a hospital. The attackers had chopped off a hand of Janta and badly slashed one of his feet.
 
 In his statement in the court of additional sessions judge in Fazilka on Wednesday, Ajay maintained that Gurjant, who was also attacked along with Bhim, had asked him to accompany them to Doda’s farmhouse to settle a dispute. “Bhim, Gurjant, Rana, Jaspal and I reached there in two cars. The first car, in which Bhim and Janta, were sitting entered the farmhouse. We parked our car outside and entered the farmhouse. On reaching there, we saw the henchmen of Doda, led by Abohar resident Harinderpal Harry, attacking Bhim and Janta with sharp-edged weapons. When we raised an alarm and came out of the farmhouse, Doda’s henchmen fled the crime scene in their vehicles,” he said.
 
 On the statements of Rana and Bhola, Wahabwala police had registered a case against 26 accused, including Doda, for brutally killing Bhim at Doda’s farmhouse. Ajay will be cross-examined on Thursday.
