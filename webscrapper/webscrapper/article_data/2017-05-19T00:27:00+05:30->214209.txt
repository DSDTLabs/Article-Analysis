Pune: Pune-based motorcycle-maker Bajaj Auto posted a 15% decrease in its fourth quarter net profit, hurt by lower sales of its vehicles in the January to March period.

 The company posted a standalone net profit of Rs 802 crore in the three-month period ended March 2017, against a net profit of Rs 949 crore, in the same period a year ago. It sold 7,87,627 units in the January to March 2017 quarter, against 8,72,458 units in the corresponding period of 2016.
 
 As a result, Bajaj Auto’s quarterly gross sales revenue was Rs 5,121 crore versus Rs 5,603 crore.
 
 In the full financial year ended March 2017, the company sold over 3.66 million vehicles, against 3.89 million vehicles it sold in FY 2016.
 
 Demonetisation, weak exports, rising input material cost and Bharat Stage – IV emission norms that came into effect from April 1, 2017 seems to have cumulatively weighed in on the company’s sales.
 
 In the domestic motorcycle segment, the Pulsar-maker’s overall market share was 18% in FY 17, a drop of 1% compared to FY 16. In FY 16, the company had gained 3% market share.

 Cummins India Q4 net down 5.38%
 
 Pune: Engines and generator maker Cummins India registered a 5.38% drop in its Q4 net profit at Rs 158 crore against Rs 167 crore, a year ago. Although the company’s overall quarterly revenue increased 11% to Rs 1,319 crore, it’s expenses increased at a faster 14% rate to Rs 1,123 crore. “Our domestic growth story continues based on the momentum from the government’s increased investments in infrastructure for the economy. Export markets continue to disappoint based on the global economic scenario. In particular, the demand for our low kilowatt generators has continued to soften, based on difficulties that some of the economies are experiencing in the middle east, Africa, Europe and Asia. Our product mix was unfavorable in the quarter, which has had an adverse impact on profitability,” said Anant Talaulicar, chairman and managing director, Cummins India.
