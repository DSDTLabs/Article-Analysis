Kolkata: The arrest of Rajesh Kumar alias Munna, the Maoist linkman in the Rifle Factory Ishapore arms smuggling racket, has opened a Pandora’s box on his political connections to mainstream parties in Bihar as well as Maoists.

 According to top officials leading the Kolkata STF, the accused had been paying Rs 1.5-2 lakh to buy Insas rifles through   officials but selling them for Rs 3-3.25 lakh to Maoist. In 10 years (from 2008 to 2018), he sold around 15 such Insas rifles from RFI besides hundreds of smaller weapons. 
 
 “After payoffs to all hands involved, he made a profit of Rs 70,000-Rs 1 lakh on each Insas rifle. We have evidence that the deals have gone through almost every year based on specific demands,” said an IPS officer heading the probe.
 
 A working president of Bihar Sharif of Rashtriya Lok Samta Party being led by Up-endra Khuswah, Munna had met Maoists in 2004 when he was in jail in a kidnapping case. “He had kept in touch with them since then. He had met arms dealer Ajay Kumar Pandey in 2008 and had been arranging weapons for gang leaders and Maoists. This is the reason Munna had come to Kolkata several times,” a source said.
 
 The police sources insisted the accused claimed he took to kidnapping to avenge his father’s murder. “We have spoken to Bihar Police to ascertain the veracity of his claims,” said an officer. DC (STF) Murlidhar Sharma said: “He is a major associate of Panditji (Ajay Kumar). Some of the big weapons smuggled out had been sold to Maoists through Munna.”
 
 The developments came on a day the probe revealed that the two junior RFI officials accused of involvement in the racket had been attending sessions to get themselves trained in identifying the “better” made scrap material from the “really bad ones”. “RFI junior works managers Sushanta Basu and Sukhda Murmu had initially trained at the Ishapore Metal and Steel Institute and joined as semi-steel artisans,” a source said.
