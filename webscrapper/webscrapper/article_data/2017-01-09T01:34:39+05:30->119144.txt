NEW DELHI: External Affairs minister Sushma   today told a Twitter user who asked for her help with his wife's transfer that if he or his wife were her employees, they would have been suspended for making the request on social media. 

 Why? The man's wife is a government employee - a   employee in  , to be precise.
 
 Swaraj sent the tweet to Railways minister  , who promptly responded by saying he didn't handle transfers, but that he'd asked the Chairman of the   to "take suitable action as per rules."
 
 Here's the tweet Swaraj received, along with her response. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The word 'banwas' or 'banishment' was a reference to another tweet that Swaraj had received from a man who said he was forced to live without his wife in the US, because she couldn't get her passport cleared. 
 
 To that tweet, Swaraj had replied that the 'banwas' should end. 
 
 She helped the man who tweeted to her today, too. But since the request she received wasn't made through the appropriate channel, her response wasn't quite the same.
