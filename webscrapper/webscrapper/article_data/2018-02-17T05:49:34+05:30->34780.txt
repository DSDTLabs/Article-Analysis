MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Friday pulled up Navi Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale after he failed to meet late builder Sunil Lahoria's son Sandeep over withdrawal of police protection. 

 A division bench of justices BR Gavai and BP Colabawala was hearing a writ petition filed by Sandeep seeking to know why police protection was withdrawn though his father's murder trial was still on and there was threat to his life as he is a key witness.
 
 The court asked the public prosecutor why Nagrale had not met Sandeep despite a court direction. "The public prosecutor told the court the CP was busy with the Prime Minister's security arrangements. The court gave the public prosecutor 15 minutes to communicate with Nagrale, saying else the court would take action. Following this, the PP informed the court that Nagrale would meet Sandeep later in the day, at 3.30pm," said counsel for Sandeep, Amey Lambhate.
 
 Nagrale is said to have told Sandeep the issue of his police protection issue will be put up before the protection committee which will take a call.
 
 Nagrale refused to comment, while DCP Tushar Doshi said Sandeep was initially given protection as there was a death perception.
 
  "Eight months ago, we had informed that henceforth his security would be chargeable. He has not paid Rs 19 lakh dues hence his security has been removed." 
 
 Sandeep, however, has alleged that police have withdrawn police protection at the behest of  , main accused in his father's murder.
 
 Meanwhile, the Thane sessions court has granted bail to property investor Ketan Chug and builders Sunil Bhanusali and Sandeep in an extortion case registered by builder Suresh Jain's son, Hitesh. The court has also directed police not to file a chargesheet in the case until the next date of hearing.
