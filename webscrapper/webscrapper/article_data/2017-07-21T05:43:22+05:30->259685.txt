MUMBAI: In a setback for the NCP and Congress, large-scale   had taken place in the presidential election in the state assembly in favour of   nominee  , indicated the poll result on Thursday.

 NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that as no whip had been issued, the possibility of cross-voting was not ruled out. “If our legislators have voted in favour of Kovind, then certainly it’s a matter of concern for us,” Malik told TOI.
 
 At least 22 MLAs from opposition parties in the state voted for Kovind. Of the 288 MLAs in the state, 287 exercised their franchise; Nalasopara   Kshitij Thakur had not voted as he was abroad. 
 
 After counting of votes it was learnt that 208 MLAs voted for Kovind, 77 for Congress nominee Meira Kumar, and two votes were declared invalid. “From the voting pattern, it is clear that 22 legislators of the Congress-NCP voted for Kovind,” a senior Congress politician said.
 
 The politician said that the total strength of the BJP, Shiv Sena and other supporting parties stood at 186 in the assembly, while Ram Nath Kovind secured the support of 208 MLAs, which meant 22 MLAs cross-voted.
 
 Poitical observers said the voting pattern showed that the BJP may not require Shiv Sena support in future — even without the 63 MLAs of the Shiv Sena in the assembly, there were 145 MLAs who voted for BJP man Kovind. In the assembly, 144 is the halfway mark.
 
 The cross-voting is being viewed as a major political victory for CM Devendra Fadnavis, who had made all-out efforts for Kovind’s victory. “As there was no whip, it was open for the legislators to   for Ram Nath Kovind or Meira Kumar. It appears that most of the legislators from Maharashtra preferred Ram Nath Kovind,” a senior BJP politician said.
 
 The politician said Fadnavis was instrumental in pacifying Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and securing his party’s support for Kovind.
