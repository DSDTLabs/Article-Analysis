KOLKATA: Leaning against the collapsible gate at the VIP crematorium of  , he was heard murmuring: “Bolo Hori Hori Bol.. Thakur or atmake santi dio (God, give peace to his soul).”  , who was not on the best of terms with the deceased, said he had called up policemen and expressed his desire to conduct his nephew’s cremation two days after De was found dead in his Watgunge apartment.

 “We had differences. Lots of them. But now that he is no more, such differences don’t matter. I remember him as a lovely young boy, brilliant in studies and extremely humble and cultural. I had called the policemen and expressed my desire to conduct the cremation. Father Rodney got in touch with us and today we have paid Partha the last homage he deserved,” said the septuagenarian. 
 
 His son Arjun performed the last rites according to Hindu customs, touching a flame to De’s body before it was taken inside the electric furnace.
 
 On Friday, Arun reached SSKM morgue around 1pm and claimed Partha’s body. An error by the cops that lead to De’s name being misspelt slightly delayed the delivery procedure, till Fr Rodney Borneo called up some senior officers and solved the issue.
 
 From the morgue, De’s body was taken to St Ignatius Church at Ekbalpore, where the church authorities, in presence of members of Missionaries of Charity and De’s family, conducted a funeral service. The hearse then brought the body to Keoratola. 
 
 Arun added that the family will also conduct a shradh in a few days. “Partha wanted dignity. He did not want to be remembered as the ‘skeleton man’, but simply as Partha. Those were the last lines in his autobiography. On February 20, he had mailed me a synopsis of the manuscript and the day after, he was dead,” said father Rodney.
