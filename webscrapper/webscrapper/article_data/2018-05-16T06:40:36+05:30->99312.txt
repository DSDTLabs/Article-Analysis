BENGALURU: It would be inappropriate for a   to depose in a  , the high court has said.

 
 The HC made this observation while hearing a   wherein one of the witnesses brought in by the husband had cast aspersions about the wife’s character.
 
 The court noted that the witness, Maruthi Dakappa, was staying in some other place and that the husband, Chandrashekar Chavan, had failed to indicate the relationship of that person with his family.
 
 In his testimony before the family court, witness Dakappa had alleged that Chavan’s wife was an alcoholic and she had an extramarital relationship with her brother-in-law.
 
 “It would be appropriate for family members or neighbours to come and depose in family disputes to support either of the spouse, but not a stranger or person from another village,” a division bench headed by Justice Ravi Malimath observed while dismissing Chavan’s petition.
 
 Chavan had challenged the December 12, 2013 order passed by the Ballari family court which upheld the petition filed by the wife seeking divorce on grounds of cruelty.
