MUMBAI: The   has thrown open its   facility for students and alumni after a year-long pilot project. The first alumni digital locker was created for the university’s old boy  . The locker holds documents safe and in digital format, relinquishing the need for physical papers.

 The Digital Locker system, developed by an IIT, Madras-incubated company, was handed over to the university as part of the R&D and technology transfer plan for powering universities to go digital. 
 
 The technology will support requirements of the government’s digital locker programme, academic repository, embassy/foreign qualification recognition plans and private digital locker service providers, said vice-chancellor  . Using the digital locker facility, students and alumni can send digital credentials for job applications or higher studies requirements. The facility will also comply with the UGC’s new requirements of adding Aadhaar number, photographs and other details of the student on certificates and marksheets.
 
 As part of the programme, verification of degrees, marksheets and other documents will go digital. The online process aims to reduce processing time by more than 80%, added Deshmukh.
 
 The university’s verification staff has been provided with a secure and dedicated login ID. Higher officials will review reports of turnaround time, cases of fake degrees and long pending cases.
 
 Details of fake degrees detected will be uploaded on the university’s website automatically as required by the state information commissioner, said a university official. The programme is in line with the government’s efforts to set up a National Academic Repository and Digital Locker Service. The university is taking up key initiatives to turn itself into a centre of excellence with a focus on digital initiatives, added Deshmukh.
