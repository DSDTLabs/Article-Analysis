PANAJI: The leading exponent of the   gharana of Kathak dance in India, Pt Birju Maharaj has a vast treasure of   inherited from his father. Speaking to TOI, the stalwart said, “My father has written 5,000 poems on Krishna which comprises of bhajan, thumri, dadra etc. But he didn’t have the knowledge about printing them so they were not all saved.”

 Pt Birju Maharaj has however managed to document most of these compositions with the help of his mother. “My mother recalled some of the poems and narrated them to me. Even I am blessed in a way that I don’t have to search for words while penning my father’s compositions; it all just comes to me and I write. I now have a collection of 300 of his compositions this way.” he said.
 
 He is in Goa to conduct a teacher-training Kathak workshop which is a part of the Indo-Norwegian cooperation between Spic Macay and Concerts Norway.
