PANAJI: Goa   MPs, ministers and state party president on Sunday attacked the   leaders in the state for their demand that a new chief minister be appointed in Goa, as CM Manohar Parrikar is undergoing treatment in the US. The state BJP leaders said that Congress is feeling frustrated that Goa government is functioning efficiently.

 “The Congress asks us to change our CM. It is not like the Congress where the party president is changed three times in a year,” said BJP president   while addressing the booth level BJP workers at Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium on Sunday. 
 
 “Whatever note we forward to the CM, it is approved within two days. Congress is feeling sad and frustrated because we are functioning efficiently. There are nearly 4,000 to 5,000 government jobs in Goa. Party workers need to be patient. As soon as the CM returns, the recruitment process for these jobs will begin,” said power minister Pandurang Madkaikar.
 
 Panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho said that the Mopa airport will act as a growth engine for the state. “Union minister Suresh Prabhu wants to make Goa a logistics hub and start-up centre. These, along with Mopa airport, will generate jobs like never before,” Godinho said. 
 
 Health minister Vishwajit Rane, Union minister for   and Goa BJP prabhari Avinash Rai Khanna were also among those who reacted to Congress’ demand for appointment of a new chief minister for Goa.
 
 Deputy speaker of state legislative assembly   said that the new Mandovi bridge will be opened for use by December this year, while the new Zuari bridge will be ready within the next one-and-a-half years.
 
 “The Congress workers cannot digest the fact that development works are progressing smoothly in the state. We need to force them to hear how well it is working,” said South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar.
