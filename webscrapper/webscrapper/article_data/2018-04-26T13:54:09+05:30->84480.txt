COIMBATORE: At a time when the city is facing a harsh summer and an imminent threat of drinking   crisis, a drinking water pipeline on Cross Cut Road in front of a popular jewellery outlet has been leaking for the past two months. Residents and shop owners in the area say they have made several complaints to the corporation officials, but in vain.

 When TOI visited the spot on Wednesday, water was leaking from a pipeline in front of Joy Alukkas showroom and was draining into a storm water drain. A security guard of a shop said he had been complaining to corporation officials, but no action has been taken so far.
 
 “Water leaks here once in four to five days, whenever there is drinking water supply. Sometimes water leaks for the whole day. We have been complaining to the officials regularly. Even today morning I had called them and complained. But nothing has happened so far,” said the security guard.
 
 A resident of the area said the road was dug about a year ago to lay underground ED cables. “The workers had damaged the whole water pipelines of the area. Residents spent from our pockets and repaired the water pipelines. But now there seems to be a crack in the main pipeline from which water is leaking,” said the resident. 
 
 He added that he had been complaining repeatedly to officials and also the corporation-licensed plumbers. A corporation executive engineer said the complaint hadn’t reached him so far. “I will look into the issue and will get the leak fixed,” the engineer said.
