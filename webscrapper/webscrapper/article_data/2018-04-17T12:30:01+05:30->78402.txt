SHIMLA: The public works department (PWD) in   had no process in place to guage the requirement of bitumen, its allocation or payment and its procurement at the division level was made without following the principles of financial propriety. The database of receipt, issue and consumption was not maintained at apex level and monitoring mechanism for bitumen was almost non-existent.

 This was stated by the   report tabled in the state assembly earlier this month.
 
 Every year, after finalization of annual plan for carrying out periodical maintenance of roads, the engineer-in-chief makes division-wise allocation of bitumen. The funds for allocated bitumen are allotted to the paying division for making payment in advance to the companies making the supply.
 
 Now, the CAG audit has found that there was short receipt of 663.221 metric tons (MT) of bitumen valuing Rs 2.51 crore against allocations and supply orders.
