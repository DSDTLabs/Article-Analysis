The forest department will soon initiate steps to recover the 3,389 hectares (8,374 acres) of land leased by Bombay Burma Trading Corporation Ltd ( ) in   in the core area of   (KMTR). It is part of the 22,979 hectares that were declared as part of the reserve forest in the GO dated January 12, 2018.

 Calling the   ruling and the GO as the end of a four-decade legal battle that began in 1978, KMTR field director (FD) A Venkatesh told TOI that the case would set a precedent for many such cases involving plantations across the country. He said reclaiming the land would be instrumental in the conservation of the fauna and flora of the tiger reserve.
 
 “Notice will be sent to the company, regarding the payment of dues (revised lease along with interest) to the tune of ₹223.96 crore,” he said. Regarding the Madras high court order dated September 1, 2017, that was upheld by the Supreme Court on January 19, 2018, he said the court gave a favourable ruling in three of the four cases.
 
 
  
  
 
 The FD said in the case pertaining to utilising the leased land, the Madras high court permitted the company to use the land for a period of 99 years - till 2028. But it was let open to the actions possible under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and Supreme Court order WP No 202/1995 (dated 12-12-1996). “But the Forest (Conservation) Act and Supreme Court order 202/1995 clearly state that forest land cannot be used for any other purposes. “So we will be initiating steps to reclaim the 3,389 hectares in the core area of the tiger reserve. It will begin with collecting the dues along with interest,” he said.
 
 The FD said BBTCL had been paying only ₹1.75 as rent per acre per year, as per the lease agreement. For the entire area of 8,374 acres they have been paying only ₹14,235 a year. Though the Zamindari Abolition Act came to effect in 1948, the Board of Revenue in 1958 allowed BBTCL to continue till the end of the lease period in 2028.
 
 “From 1958 the total rent paid by the company is only ₹8.54 lakh. We have calculated the pending rent at ₹223.96 crore, including an interest of 12%. The   was fixed at 12.5% of guideline value based on land registration in the nearest panchayat,” the FD said.
