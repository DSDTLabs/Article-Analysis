SHIMLA:   has demanded financial support from   government for providing air connectivity to Shimla, the only state capital of the country which has had no flight service since last four years. 

 Sources said Alliance Air has sought financial support per return flight to provide air connectivity between Delhi-Shimla-Delhi route. Since September 2012, when Kingfisher stopped its services, the   airport near Shimla has turned into a white elephant as high end tourists have stayed away.
 
 Himachal Pradesh chief secretary V C Pharka said the government is examining the   for financial support. He said a final decision on the matter would be taken only after receiving a reply from the finance department.
 
 The Shimla airport was constructed in 1987 and airlines like Vayudoot, Jagson Airlines, Air Deccan and Kingfisher Airlines operated from here till September 2012 without any Viability Gap Funding (VGF) or other assistance from the state government. Even the runway has been widened to meet the requirement for landing of ATR-72.
 
 In December last year, Shimla MP Virender Kashyap had claimaed that 19-seater Dornier flights would start from New Delhi to Shimla in March. He had made announcement after meeting Union minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha. Earlier, chief minister Virbhadra Singh had raised the issue of air connectivity to Shimla with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October.
