Ahmedabad: Abhay Bhardwaj, senior lawyer and part-time member of the   of India, said the draft Advocates (Amendment) Bill is a “surrender document of lawyers”. Speaking at a press conference in Ahmedabad on Sunday, he demanded withdrawal of the draft bill which has been prepared by the Law Commission.

 Bhardwaj, a Rajkot-based lawyer was a defense counsel in the 2002 Gulbarg riots case. He said that the bill, which is currently under the central government’s consideration, puts lawyers at the mercy of judges who can take away their licences and even fine them for misconduct. He demanded that the Centre send the draft bill back to the Law Commission and ask it to remove anti-lawyer provisions.
 
 “We do not agree with several aspects of the draft bill,” Bhardwaj said. “The final draft was not sent to us (part-time members of the commission) for consideration. Even the minutes of the March 7 meeting in which the draft was finalised, have not been sent to us.”
 
 Bhardwaj further said that he does not agree with the proposed draft as it is anti-advocate. “Judges cannot be allowed to become a law unto themselves,” Bhardwaj said. “This is a surrender document for lawyers. The bill wants advocates to be tamed. Misconduct by a lawyer will be determined by a judge who can even bar the former from practicing. Judges should not be permitted to rule over lawyers.”
