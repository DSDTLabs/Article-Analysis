LUCKNOW: Across Dalibagh area of  , pedestrians watched in awe as police jeeps chased down a Tata Safari on Thursday evening. Worried that some criminal was on the loose, residents of the areas surrounding Ganna Sansthan locked their doors and peeped out from their balconies, as the district police chief gave the black Tata Safari, adorned with a Secretariat gate pass (which is assigned only to MLAs), the chase. The SUV, with registration number UP32FP5000, is registered in the name of one Ashish Kumar Dwivedi. 

 On the way back from Gomtinagar to his residence in  ,   Deepak Kumar had spotted the SUV on Rana Pratap Marg around 4.30pm, bearing black film on its windows. He immediately asked the driver of his official vehicle, and the jeep escort, to make U-turns and follow the Safari.
 
 Eventually, when the police intercepted the SUV at Dalibagh, the SSP's public relations officer, sub-inspector Sanjay Kharwar asked the driver to produce necessary documents. During questioning, it was revealed the Secretariat gate pass was assigned to BJP MLA and cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya. By the time the policemen tore off the black film and issued a challan to the driver for violating traffic rules, locals who had started gathering to observe the spectacle had realised the matter was not that serious, and had started dispersing.
 
 Later, Maurya told TOI, "The vehicle is used by my son. Henceforth, I've asked him to follow road rules." Meanwhile, the SSP directed all station house officers and police outpost in-charges to carry out spot checks every evening over the next fortnight. "Two-wheeler riders without helmet and four-wheeler commuters without seat belts will be on our radar. Other offenders will also be pulled up," warned Kumar.
