Nagpur: Eminent environmentalist and wildlife expert Kishor Rithe was conferred ‘Uttamrao Patil Smruti Vansamvardhan Award’ by commissioner of police K Venkatesham for his outstanding efforts to save nature, besides taking up various issues concerning the forests, at a function held at Dhanwate Sabhagruh on Wednesday. The felicitation programme was organized jointly by Vanarai Foundation, Maharashtra forest department and Padonnat Vanpal organization. Vanarai president Girish Gandhi was in the chair while chief conservator of forests Shree Bhagwan was the chief guest. Addressing the gathering, Bhagwan said, “Rithe has contributed immensely to the preservation of nature and wildlife and helped resolve many issues. His work as a mediator between non-government organizations and the authorities is praiseworthy as he effectively handled human encroachment on forest lands. His efforts to protect environment and wildlife are worth emulating.”  Gandhi said efforts of conservationists like Rithe have been yielding results with the society understanding the importance of nature and wildlife and taking a stand against those bent on destroying it.  Replying to the felicitation, Rithe, who is director of Satpuda Foundation and also a member of National Board for Wildlife, said his organization focused on making people aware of dangers of destructing nature, and protecting wildlife. Satpuda Foundation has trained over 5,000 people in wildlife and nature conservation who are now engaged in creating awareness among the masses, he said. Narrating his experience in wildlife conservation, Rithe said one should go to the root of the problem to curb forest crimes and protect flora and fauna. Rather than letting human encroachments increase on the forest cover, people living in the remote areas should be provided with basic facilities. This will help protect vegetation and environment, he added. Dipak Nilawar proposed a vote of thanks.
