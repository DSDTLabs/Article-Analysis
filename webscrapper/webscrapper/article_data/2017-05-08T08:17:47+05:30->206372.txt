MYSURU: Against a backdrop of unrest and turmoil within the party's state unit,   president BS   on Sunday announced that the list of candidates for next year's assembly elections would be finalized by the end of 2017.

 As the curtains came down on the two-day executive meet of the BJP   unit, Yeddyurappa reportedly informed the delegates that candidates would be chosen based on an internal survey commissioned by the party's central leadership. Cautioning leaders against lobbying for tickets, Yeddyurappa said, “Clean image and winning potential will be the basic criteria for candidate selection.“
 
 Delivering the valedictory address, Yeddyurappa called upon workers and leaders to use social media platforms to reach out to the voters. “We must promote the policies and programmes launched by the central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi,“ he said.
 
  minister of state for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman was among the central party leaders present at the meet. Dubbing the Congress government in Karnataka “most corrupt“, Sitharaman said, “There hasn't been a single alle g ation against the NDA government at the Centre.“
 
 Pointing to the party's recent victories in the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand assembly elections and the Delhi civic polls, Sitharaman said, “They were a verdict against corruption, inefficiency and maladministration of the opposition. Voters are impressed with Modi's performance and opting for the BJP.“
 
 Seconding Yeddyurappa's appeal to the workers to raise awareness among voters about Modi's governance model, Sitharaman added, “We must work towards a Congress-mukth Karnataka. We have to keep in mind people's aspirations to vote out this government, and prepare ourselves to achieve this historical necessity .“
 
 Yeddyurappa announced that the next executivemeet of the Karnataka BJP would be held in   on July 22 and 23.
 
 Meanwhile, the for mer chief minister's nemesis and BJP national secretary (Organisation) BL Santhosh exhorted workers to strengthen the party at the grassroots in the state.
