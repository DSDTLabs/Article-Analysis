DUMKA: Two senior BJP leaders on Tuesday accused the state bureaucracy of non-implementation of government schemes meant for the economically backward section of the society. 

 Godda BJP MP   directed the   to suspend seven   on charges of alleged corruption and indifference towards implementation of both central and state-sponsored schemes. 
 
 “The Godda administration had asked the state government whether an MP could issue a direction to initiate suspension of officials, to which the government recently gave its nod,” Dubey said, adding that the case was a first of its kind. 
 
 The MP also said that it was due to the apathy of the government officials, particularly those posted at the block headquarters, that common people continued to remain deprived of the Centre’s schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). 
 
 In a similar remark, senior BJP leader and state minister Saryu Rai said the execution of government schemes, including food security, were in shambles. “I learnt that new white ration cards are yet to be distributed among the beneficiaries,” Rai, who was in Dumka on Monday to attend a divisional level public hearing programme on Right to Food, said. The minister received hundreds of complaints related to   schemes and inadequate supply of food grains.
