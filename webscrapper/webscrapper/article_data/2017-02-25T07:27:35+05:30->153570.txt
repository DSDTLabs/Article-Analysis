PUDUCHERRY: Celebrating the creative side of the Union territory, the Pondicherry Heritage Festival is exhibiting a slew of homegrown brands which are eco-friendly sustainable and unique. For the first time since its inception three years ago, the festival is hosting an expo of brands, Made in Pondy, at the city’s Crafts Bazaar next to the famed Bharathi Park.

 While Hidesign leather products,   and MAROMA spa and fragrance items are the more recognizable names, also present are lesser known brands and boutiques. 
 
 Many of them are well-known among the residents and tourists including the fragrance and incense outlet Auroshikha, part of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, antique furniture outfit Geethanjali, Sri Lakshmi jewellers, an 80-year-old retail presence in the city and much-visited Pondy boutiques LAL and Disdis. Others like J Seetharaman’s Saran Exports is less visible, even though he supplies high-end bed linen to hotels in west Asia.
 
 “The whole idea is to showcase all those who are making beautiful things in Pondicherry and Auroville and helping the local economy not only in terms of revenue generation but also job creation,” said  , spokeswoman, Pondicherry Heritage Festival. 
 
 Puducherry’s basket of conscious brands sends out the message that entrepreneurship can also be creative and sustainable, and not necessarily scale-driven and without social consciousness. 
 
 Indeed many of the brands partnering for this event are all about eco-friendly artisanal products. That includes the likes of UPASANA which is into organic fabrics, the Sri Aurobindo Hand Made Paper and Auroville Papers and Naturellement organic jams, jellies and preserves which works exclusively with village women. There are also products that normally don’t see any retail display at all including the exquisite made-to-order embroidery items that sisters of the Cluny Convent are famous for.
