VARANASI: Citing the couplets of  , Prime Minister   not only tried to target the BSP supremo Mayawati and new friendship of AICC vice president Rahul Gandi and UP chief minister   without taking their names but also cautioned to beware of 'selfish' people. 

 "Ye Kabir ki dharti hai, aur Sant Kabir kah gaye hain (This the land of Sant Kabit, and he had said) -"Maya ko maya mile kar kar lambe hath; Nisprehi niradhar ko gahak dinanath" (When the rich meets rich, they talk lovingly; The selfless and pious have only the almighty to save)," said PM clarifying, "ise kisi ke naam se na jodein" (Don't connect it with anyone's name).
 
 Addressing the at the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) ground on Sunday evening, he said: "Those who were talking '27 saal UP behal' have found a new friend," referring to Congress-SP alliance. Exhorting people to take part in large numbers, he said that election is an important festival of democracy, and it needs active participation of people. It is also the duty of political parties to reach maximum people to connect them for running the country.
 
 "There is a need for public movement to get the desired goal of development," he said adding that it is unfortunate that there was a big gap between government and public. Tendering vote should not be treated as giving a 5-year contract to a party. Such a tendency was misused by political parties and leaders. 
 
 "We have to come out of the five-five year cycle," he said. It is not the Nehru era when only one party ruled the nation, today different parties have governments in different states. Now time has come to evaluate their performance," he said that people had seen the communist government in West Bengal that faced evils like poverty and bad law and order.
 
 The country had also seen the rule of Congress, and rule of 'parivarik party'. Now it is time to exmine where BJP stands," he said.
