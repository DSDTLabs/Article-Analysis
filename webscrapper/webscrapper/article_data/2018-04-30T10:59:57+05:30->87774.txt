BENGALURU: The   region is on BJP’s poll radar like never before. For, the party has realised that winning more seats in this Vokkaliga bastion is crucial for the party to cross the halfway mark on its own to return to power in the state.

 
 The region consists of 39 seats and the saffron brigade has never tasted electoral success in a big way here, though it did win a few seats in 2008 and 2013. In Mandya district, the party is yet to open its account — in the fight between JD(S) and Congress,   has been reduced to a mute spectator.
 
 This is perhaps why Prime Minister   and BJP national president Amit Shah have been focusing on this region. While Shah has done many rounds already, Modi is all set to kickstart his campaign from Santhemarahalli in Chamarajanagar district, a Congress bastion, on May 1. This is his third visit to the region in the past three months.
 
 This apart, a host of other leaders, both from the BJP and RSS have been working at the ground level for the past six months, says a BJP insider. Several Union ministers have also campaigned in Hassan, Mandya, Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts and more have been enlisted to tour the area.
 
 “Old Mysuru region is a weak link for the BJP. It has to win more seats here if it wants to get a majority in the assembly on its own. This has forced its national leadership to focus on the region,” says a BJP leader who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
 However, state BJP media convener S Prakash said there is nothing like special focus on Old Mysuru. The party is focusing equally on all regions. Modi will address 15 public rallies across the state. Shah has toured all districts of the state. “So to say that the party is focusing on Old Mysuru region is not correct,” he added.
