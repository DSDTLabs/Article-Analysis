Ludhiana: A local court has sentenced a man to life imprisonment after it found him guilty of murdering his employer about 22 years ago. The court of additional sessions Judge JPS Khurmi also imposed a fine of Rs 26,000 on the convict.

 On July 17, 1995, Raikot Police had lodged a case of murder and loot against four persons on the complaint of Gurbinder Kaur of Sultan Khan Waala. 
 
 In her police complaint, Gurbinder said her father had hired Ramesh Saha and Raju Mandal, a Bihar native, to work at their home and on his farm land. She added that it was on their recommendation that the family later hired Ganesh Mandal and Ramesh Lal Saha as labourers.
 
 The complainant added that on the intervening night of July 16-17, 1995, Raju Mandal called the deceased, Ajit Singh, to the fields close to their home. She added that when her mother Mohinder Kaur followed her father, she saw Raju and Ramesh attacking him with sharp edged weapons leading to his death. They later threw his body into a well.
 
 After Gurbinder and her mother raised an alarm, the accused followed them but they managed to lock themselves in the bathroom. Later the accused ran away with their belongings. 
 
 After registering a case, police started searching for the accused. While three of the accused were earlier arrested and convicted in the case, Ramesh Saha was nabbed from Bihar on August 31, 2014. 
 
 Police later produced a challan against the accused in the court, which convicted Ramesh and sentenced him to life imprisonment, after taking evidence into consideration.
