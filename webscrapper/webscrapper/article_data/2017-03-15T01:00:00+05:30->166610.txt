Riding high on the success of his recently released medico thriller,   seems to have finalised his next. A source says that the actor will be teaming up with director   again. The duo, who worked earlier in Thadaiyara Thaakka, we hear, is joining hands for a thriller. Arun Vijay says, “I heard the script just after I completed the work of my recent film. We have been in talks since then — he has come up with a brilliant script. Just how   was an important film in my career, this project, too, is expected to boost my career and engage the audience. As of now, I can only say that the film will be an intense thriller. The director is still finalising a few things and we should make an official announcement soon.”
