 When asked whether the 100 GW target was achievable given the slow pace of awarding of contracts, he said, "It is indeed an achievable target.

Last year only 8,000 MW capacity was added but if we have to achieve the 100GW target the government will have to increase the pace of capacity addition." PSK NP MR
