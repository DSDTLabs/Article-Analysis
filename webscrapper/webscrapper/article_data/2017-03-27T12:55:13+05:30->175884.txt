NEW DELHI: A Pakistani man has pardoned 10 Indians who are on death row after being convicted of killing is son in Abu Dhabi in 2015, BBC Urdu reported.

 A UAE court has approved the request that the father be paid 'blood money'. The court still has to rule on the pardon, but it appears likely the 10 men will be freed,  's The Express Tribune said. Under   or  , which the UAE follows, the victim's family can file an appeal in court against the death penalty for the convicts if the two reconcile and the former pardons the latter. 
 
 
 "It was unfortunate that I lost my son. I have forgiven these 10 individuals. In fact, Allah has saved their lives," said Mohammad Riaz, the father of Muhammad Farhan, who was killed by the Indians following an altercation. 
 
  
 "The lives of at least 10 people, including a wife and children, hinge [financially] on one person [who comes to work in the UAE]. I appeal (to) the young generation not to indulge in such fights," said Riaz.
 
 The 'blood money' is being provided by a Dubai-based Indian businessman, SP Singh Oberoi, who heads a charitable trust. In Islamic law, 'blood money' is paid to the victim's family as compensation, according to gulfnews.com. In the UAE, 'blood money' for all males residing the country, whatever their religion or nationality, is 200,000 dirham. (It's half that for females.)
 
 Oberoi, the Indian businessman, said the trust invited Riaz to come to the UAE and arranged a visa and accommodation for him and his family.
 
  "We somehow made him agree (to pardon the convicts) â€¦ and as per Sharia law, have submitted 200,000 dirhams as blood money in the court," Oberoi added.
