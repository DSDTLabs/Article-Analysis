CHANDIGARH: Taking up the case related to multiple allotment of plots in areas developed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda), the Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday directed the agency’s chief administrator to file a detailed affidavit on inquiry in all cases pertaining to different categories.

 “Affidavit should also mention as to why the recommendations were made for lodging of FIR against some persons and not against all. All details be mentioned in the affidavit by enclosing the status report signed by the members of committee by mentioning plot number, sector, urban estate, lodging of FIR, status of criminal case, notice issued or not, reply of the notice and its ultimate conclusion,” the court observed.
 
 Huda has been asked to file the affidavit within six weeks. Justice   of the HC passed these orders while observing several ambiguities in Huda policies regarding conditions for the allotment of plots. The case would now come up for hearing on August 2.
 
 Known as Haryana’s ‘Adarsh scam’, the irregularities in plot allotments surfaced in 2013, when HC had ordered probe into the matter after finding that a large number of defence personnel in the state were getting plots in Huda-developed sectors by submitting forged affidavits.
 
 They were entitled to get one plot under defence category at subsidized rates in their lifetime, but managed to get from two to 25 plots by submitting false affidavits and concealing previous allotments. On HC intervention, a large number of senior politicians, bureaucrats and judges and other higherups were also found involved in getting allotment of plots under discretionary quota from the Haryana government or under reservation on nominal price. They made hefty amount through the sale of those plots subsequently on high premium.
