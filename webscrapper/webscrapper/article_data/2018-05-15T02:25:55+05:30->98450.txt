NEW DELHI: Union finance minister   on Monday underwent a successful kidney transplant at the   ( ), an official at the premier health institute said. Both the donor and the recipient are stable and recovering well, the official added.

 
 Jaitley, 65, was admitted to the hospital on Saturday and taken to the operation theatre at 8.30am on Monday. It took about four hours to harvest the donor kidney and transplant it into the recipient, said sources.
 
 "Both the donor and the recipient were shifted to the ICU thereafter. They are stable and recovering well," said a doctor, who did not want to be quoted.
 
 According to sources, former professor of surgery at AIIMS Dr Sandeep Guleria, who is now with Apollo Hospital, led the transplant team. Dr VK Bansal from AIIMS' surgery unit and nephrologist Dr Sandeep Mahajan were also present.
 
 The finance minister had confirmed his illness in a tweet on April 6, when he was previously admitted to AIIMS for kidney transplant. The life-saving surgery could not be conducted then as the minister's sugar level and other vitals weren't in control. A team of experts in medicine and endocrinology worked on them to make sure Jaitley was stable enough to undergo the surgery.
 
 In September 2014, Jaitley underwent a bariatric surgery to treat weight gain.
