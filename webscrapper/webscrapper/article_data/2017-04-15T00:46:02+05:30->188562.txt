Trichy: Trichiites on Friday took ‘No Straw Challenge’, a collaborative effort by various NGOs and youth organisations in the city, discouraging the usage of straw made of plastic to drink juice and other beverages. 

 Plastic straws being the eighth biggest pollutants of water bodies in the world, volunteers from various organizations converged under the banner of ‘Ithu Namathu Trichy’ to sensitise the public on the menace. The campaign has gone viral in social media platforms with people posting selfies while taking #NoStrawChallenge by drinking beverages without straw. 
 
 City corporation commissioner N Ravichandran led many others to take the NoStrawChallenge as they gathered near the central bus stand on Friday as part of the event. Juice was served to the gathered - for a change in paper glasses made of sugarcane pulp. “These glasses are safe unlike other paper glasses available in the market with wax coating,” said Manoj Dharmar, founder member of Shine TREEchy, a voluntary youth organisation which initiated the online campaign. “We came to know that a district in Kerala has banned the usage of straws. We hope the city corporation too comes up with a similar initiative,” he said. 
 
 It might be hard to believe how using a plastic straw is going to cause a huge damage to the environment, says Ganesan, a volunteer. Recalling an incident, he said, “Recently a team of scientists in Costa Rica came across an endangered species of sea turtle with what they thought was a parasitic worm blocking its airway. They realized it was actually a plastic straw. The scientists successfully dislodged the straw themselves and released the turtle back into the ocean. The team members filmed their efforts and one can see the ordeal that the turtle underwent in the online video,” he said. “A straw can be used only once unlike other plastics like carry bags as it is dumped after use,” said event coordinator A Akshaya.
