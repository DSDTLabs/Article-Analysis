PANAJI:   Nilesh Cabral said on Tuesday that coal minister Piyush Goyal apologised for his statement on the Goa mining issue turning into another ‘Coalgate’, after they thoroughly briefed him on the issue. Goyal had told the all-party delegation in no uncertain terms that the state government would have to auction iron ore mine leases.

 Cabral told reporters that after hearing them out, Goyal was “convinced and he assured us to take up the matter. He (Goyal) apologised for his statement”. 
 
 The Curchorem MLA said that the all-party delegation went to Delhi not to protect the interest of mines owners, but to protect the economic activities of the state so that mining operations can continue after March 15.
 
 Mining belt MLAs had demanded that if the central government cannot amend the Goa Daman and Diu Mining Concession (Abolition and Declaration as Mining Leases) Act, 1987, so that leases can continue to operate after March 15, then they should bring in an ordinance on the lines of Jallikattu to continue mining activities for at least four year till the mines in Goa are auctioned.
 
 He added that the all-party delegation will once again leave for Delhi on March 9 to meet finance minister  , mines minister   and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. “If possible, we will meet the prime minister,” he added.
 
 Mining belt MLAs also urged Congress to get in touch with their high command to convince them to support the Goa mining issue. “Congress should contact its president and leader of opposition in   and seek support for mining in Goa,” Cabral said.
 
 The MLAs said that if mining comes to a halt on March 15, it would adversely affect people of Goa. Cabral said they will urge the government to take a cabinet decision to solve the mining issues and forward the decision to the Union government.
 
 “We will meet the governor and ask her to take up the mining issue with the Union government to come out with a solution,” Cabral said.
