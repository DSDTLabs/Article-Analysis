PANAJI: The government is yet to finalise fresh date for elections to the state’s 185  , even as the high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday directed it to complete the entire process on or before June 12. It further declined to accept the government’s rationale behind  .

 The government had deferred panchayat elections to June 17, even as the term of the current bodies will end in the middle of May. 
 
 Advocate   had filed a public interest litigation (PIL), alleging that the government’s decision was unconstitutional. 
 
 When contacted, panchayat minister   said while the government was considering all options, it would arrive at a decision by Friday afternoon. He also claimed to have not received a certified copy of the court’s judgment in the matter, although election authorities indicated June 10 or 11 as the poll date.
 
 The state government had sought to defer panchayat elections on the grounds that imposition of the code of conduct would further hamper administrative functioning. It stated that the code of conduct during the assembly polls, which remained in force for two months, hindered it from taking any policy decisions.
