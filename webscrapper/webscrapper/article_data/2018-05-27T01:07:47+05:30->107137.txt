GURUGRAM: Some students from the economically weaker section (EWS) category have passed the Class XII exam with flying colours. Scoring 92.5% in the commerce stream,   from Ajanta Public School, Sector 31, is one such example.

 The 17-year-old girl was under a lot of pressure after she lost her father to cardiac arrest in Class IX. Her family was finding it really difficult to make ends meet. “My mother is a homemaker. Ever since my father passed away, we have found it difficult to live. My family solely depends on whatever financial help my relatives can provide,” she said on Saturday.
 
 However, after being admitted to the school under the EWS category, her studies were taken care of. “I have been going through some of the worst days of my life but that didn’t stop me from studying. I want to change my fortunes and that can only happen when I get a good job,” Tilotma said. She lives in Sector 31 with her mother and two younger siblings who are studying in classes III and V in the same school.
 
 Tilotma borrowed books from her seniors to ensure that she did not have to spend money on them. “I had the option of taking books from seniors and they always gave me the same. I also used the school library for any aditional books that I needed. I had less resources but I made the most of it,” she added.
 
 Now, she wants to do her graduation from a good college in DU. “I would like to go to a regular college but if I can get a job which will help my family, I’ll also take that up. I have not decided about what I want to do after college,” Tilotma said.
