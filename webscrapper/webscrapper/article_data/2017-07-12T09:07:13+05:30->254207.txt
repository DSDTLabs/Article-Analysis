Police have also detained the two youths who allegedly helped him escape.
 
 Officials from   travelled with Naresh to Delhi and boarded the fourth coach of train number 64905. They made him stand at the position where he had noticed the initial scuffle between   and a 50-year-old Delhi government employee. 
 
 Naresh claimed that initially he didn’t react when the argument started as fights over seats were normal on the stretch. But he was “alarmed” when Junaid started calling his brothers and cousins for help. A police officer said that Naresh told them that “a group of teenagers thrashing an elderly man did not go down well with him”. 
 
 When Junaid and his brothers got down and entered the next coach, he followed them with two labourers. He said he used his knife “for protection”. 
 
 Naresh claimed that he decided to act and teach them a lesson. He attacked Junaid’s brother, Shaqir, and stabbed him in his chest twice.When Junaid tried to interevene, Naresh pushed him to the ground and stabbed him eight times in his chest and abdomen. “He claimed to be furious with the previous scuffle and decided to teach Junaid and his brothers a lesson,” said a police officer.
 
 When the train reached Asaoti, Junaid threw the knife out of the train and got off. He called his friends at the station to help him escape. After reaching home, he hid the bloodstained clothes in a trunk and left for a relative’s place in Faridabad. He kept changing his location for the next few days before fleeing to Maharashtra.
