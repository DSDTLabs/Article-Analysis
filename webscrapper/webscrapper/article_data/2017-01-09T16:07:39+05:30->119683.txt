It was celebration time for team Oppam recently in the city, when the cast and crew of the Mohanlal starrer gathered to raise a toast for being part of the movie. There was more to it, as the film completed 101 days of its screening.
 
  When actor Mohanlal stepped in, he became the cynosure of all eyes. An excited Nivin Pauly was on-stage along with the actor, as he talked about his favourite film of his icon. When the Premam star got an opportunity to twirl the moustache of Mohanlal, it kept the audience in high spirits. 
  
  A huge lineup of celebrities including Nivin Pauly, Alphonse Puthren, Aju Varghese and Prakash Raj, among many others made it to the event. While actress Roma appeared totally stylish, Vimala Raman looked more like a traditional beauty.
  
  The presence of director Priyadarshan, Samuthirakani, Devshi Khanduri, MG Sreekumar was inevitable, given that all of them were part of the runaway success.
