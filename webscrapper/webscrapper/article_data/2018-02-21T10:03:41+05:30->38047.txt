BENGALURU: A Bengaluru woman has alleged that men claiming to be supporters of  , elder son of   MLA N A  , had   her with dire consequences three years ago. 

 "I was standing outside a hotel on MG Road and the gang of men openly threatened me, saying if I approach police, they would butcher me in daylight," the woman, who identified herself as Poornima Das, claimed in a video that went viral on social media on Tuesday.
 
 Das said she was attending an event and had taken objection to a speaker allegedly abusing one particular community. "It was an NGO conference where the speaker was spreading hate messages against one community. I objected to this and walked out and decided to file a police complaint. On MG Road, men claiming to be Md Haris' supporters threatened me. I went to Cubbon Park police but the staff said the area where I was threatened falls under Ulsoor police station limits. When I went to Ulsoor police, they sent me back to Cubbon Park station. The staff at Cubbon Park station threw my complaint in a dustbin," she alleged.
 
 City police commissioner T Suneel Kumar said they will take up the case if the woman files a police complaint. "She is welcome to file a complaint. Based on the facts, we shall take up the case and investigate," he said.
 
 Police officers said they came across the video but could not identify the woman.
