MADURAI: As part of   of following   in motorists, the city police are planning to make all traffic signals ‘zero tolerant’ soon. The “zero tolerance signal”, which was first introduced at Goripalayam, has been expanded to Munichalai and Periyar.

 A dedicated policeman will be at these signals to ensure that any vehicle flouting rules is taken to task. Madurai city police commissioner   said, “In three to four months all the signals in the city would be made zero tolerance signals.” He stated this while launching ‘road safety express’, a vehicle loaded with multimedia facilities to sensitise the public on road rules. Aimed at reducing road casualties, the vehicle will be stationed at important places to reach out to the public. It will also visit colleges to make students aware of the rules. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of traffic   was present during the flagging off at the commissionerate on Thursday. A video with running time of 11.24 minutes has been created for the purpose. It is loaded with statistical information on the deterrence measures taken by the traffic wing to reduce road fatalities. What stands out in the video is its interesting narration replete with mimicry and casual talk. 
 
 Besides zero tolerance signals, Aggarwal pointed out that pathways had been cleared of encroachments and put to use for pedestrians. As many as 73 pedestrians had lost their lives in the city in 2017 half of whom were hit by vehicles from behind while walking on the carriageway. The commissioner said that there was a slight drop in the number of road deaths in the city from 232 in 2016 to 216 in 2017, due to the measures taken. Moreover, he claimed that the number of people wearing helmet had increased from around 40 per cent to 60 to 70 per cent now.
