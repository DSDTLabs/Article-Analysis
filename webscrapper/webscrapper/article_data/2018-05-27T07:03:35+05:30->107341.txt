HYDERABAD : Traffic jams during medical  , accidents, and transporting of organs will no longer be an issue for patients in Hyderabad. Wings Aviation Pvt Ltd is launching a 24/7   emergency service, Air Aid, on Saturday, touted to be the first of its kind in India.

 
 Officials said a fleet of   109 helicopters, which travel at a speed of 120 nautical miles per hour and cover 450 kms without refuelling, have been roped in for the venture set up with an initial investment of Rs 150 crore.
 
 “Each helicopter is fitted with all necessary medical equipment including a ventilator, aviation oxygen, defibrillator, multi-parameter monitor, emergency resuscitation kit, burns kit and medicine kit. There will also be professional pilots, case specific doctors and a medical team to take care of the patient,” said Prabhakar Reddy, chairman, Wings Aviation.
 
 The helicopters take 15 minutes to commute between two places, anywhere within Hyderabad, Reddy said. The firm is collaborating with major private hospitals like Apollo, for construction of helipads to ensures smooth landing in emergency. Transfer and ambulance services, at departure and arrival points will be available.
 
 “At present, the cost per hour per helicopter works out to be Rs 1.5 lakh. Hence, we are trying to collaborate with the government to avail of subsidies on rates,” Reddy said adding that his firm hopes to own at least six helicopters by this year-end.
 
 Air Aid’s services can be used during rescue operations, evacuations, fires or natural calamities also. The service will be available from Begumpet airport and can be contacted on the toll-free number (18007582080). While it is currently being implemented in Hyderabad, the firm hopes to make it accessible in cities like Chennai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Nagpur, Mumbai, and other districts and villages around   and Karnataka, soon.
