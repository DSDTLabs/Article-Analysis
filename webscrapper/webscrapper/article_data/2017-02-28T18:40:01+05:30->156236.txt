NEW DELHI: After almost a whole week's silence,  's   today touched on the 
  in Kansas, only to say that "early reports out of Kansas are...disturbing."

 White House press secretary Sean Spicer made a passing reference to what many are calling a hate crime, while he was condemning attacks on Jewish community centres across the US.
 
 "And while we're at it, I don't want to get ahead of the law enforcement, but I was asked the other day about the story in Kansas -- the shooting in Kansas. And while the story is evolving, early reports out of Kansas are equally disturbing," Spicer said.
 
  Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in US has issued a demarche on the incident to the US State Department and has called for a speedy investigation, ANI reported.
 
 
 Separately, Democrat Hillary Clinton tweeted yesterday to say Trump should speak out.

 Purinton reportedly got into an argument with the victims and hurled racial slurs. He yelled "get out of my country" and "terrorist" before shooting them.
 
 Kuchibhotla of Hyderabad and his colleague Madasani from Warangal district in Telangana were working as aviation programme managers at Garmin, an MNC.
 
 The mortal remains of the slain 32-year-old were flown to Hyderabad Monday night. He will be cremated today. 
 
 Purinton is currently being held in jail on a $2 million cash bond. The US's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is also helping gather evidence in the shooting because Kansas does not have a hate crime statute.
 
 If the FBI can prove that Purinton's actions constitute a hate crime, he could face federal charges that could potentially carry the death penalty
