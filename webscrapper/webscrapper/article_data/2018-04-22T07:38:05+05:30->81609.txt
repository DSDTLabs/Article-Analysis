 POINGUINIM: Unsure of tanker   supply every alternate day or every two days, summer is a nightmare for the 800-odd residents of Borighotto, Karnebhag, Kazuwadda and Gallink wards in Quepem near  .
 
 With some of the wells in the village having dried up in March, the villagers are facing an acute water crisis and are forced to source water from wells at least 3km away to quench their thirst. “This has been the fate of our community in these wards for years,” a villager said.
 
  
  
 
 The wards largely have a tribal population, who depend on farming and cashew plantations to eke out a living. “We get little water after two or three days and the situation is very bad,” a villager said.
 
 The erratic water supply is from a van, mounted with a water tank, which sometimes, breaks down due to the dilapidated condition of the uphill road. The situation is worse is remoter which have poor road connectivity. Even the quality of the water supplied is not so reassuring, but the villagers have very choice. 
 
 Most of the local students pack their bags as soon as their exams come to an end. “They go and stay with their relatives as there is very little water for bathing and other needs in the village,” said an elderly woman. Even social functions are shifted to other villages due to lack of water.
 
 This year, the crisis has persisted for one-and-a-half month. “Despite many complaints to the authorities, there has been no relief,” said  , an elderly woman. Katu Gaonkar, another local, said the villagers had narrated their ordeal to MLA Chandrakant Kavlekar, but to no avail. “Even the road has not been repaired,”   said.
 
 Local ward member   said the issue has been discussed during panchayat meetings and letters forwarded to the department concerned, but nothing has been done yet.
 
 Another villager said there’s no proper educational facilities either. Students have to walk for about 3km to reach the highway from where get transport for schools.
