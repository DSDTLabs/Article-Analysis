Kolkata: Three days after the Calcutta High Court banned   festivals on the occasion of ‘Folharini Kali Puja’ between May 12 and 16, various gov-ernment departments, ag-encies and citizens came together to curb illegal hu-nting of wild animals protected under the law in var-ious parts of south Bengal.

 In Howrah’s Deulti, foresters arrested one Manish Chowdhury, who is from Bihar, and found carcasses of a palm civet, a juvenile changeable hawk eagle (protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972) and a few small birds. The additional divisional forest officer of Howrah, Srikanta Ghosh, said Chowdhury would be produced in court on Monday.
 
 Over 50 civic volunteers, on behalf of Zero Hunting Alliance, came forward to help the forest department and Railway Protection Force on Sunday. The HC had on May 10 instructed the authorities concerned to help foresters ensure that no hunting took place during ‘Folharini Kali Puja’.
 
 Sources said hunting activities were expected to pick up pace on Tuesday, a day after voting for panchayat polls gets over. The forest department had raised awareness against hunting festivals via posters and audio brodcasts at various places in East Midnapore and Howrah.
