HYDERABAD: The city's limited number of component   has become a cause of worry for healthcare providers.

 The National Blood Policy clearly stresses the need for separation of components from whole blood. The policy says that all the components must be made available and hospital committees should monitor this.
 
 For instance, a normal whole blood bank cannot separate plasma and platelets, but a component lab can use plasma expanders and other equipment to do so.
 
 These labs can abstract various components like red blood corpuscles (RBC), white blood corpuscles ( ), platelets and plasma, from blood. This process helps in infusing one particular component of blood in a patient as against one patient, when whole blood is infused. According to data available with the   , there are about 150 whole blood banks in the state including 65 in Hyderabad.But only 16 labs have facilities to stop wastage of blood and ensure that every component of blood is used properly .
 
 Among them, only Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences ( ), Gandhi,   ( ), Osmania and Niloufer hospitals have component blood banks.
 
 “We are keen to launch PG medical course in blood transfusion and increase the number of blood component labs,“ said Dr M Ramani, director, medical education.
 
 Doctors say patients don't need whole blood, but only part of blood components in many cases.
 
 “For example in paediatrics, they don't need the entire blood, but some component like platelets, fresh blood plasma, RBC or some coagulation factors, which help in clotting of blood. Injecting the whole blood in the patient amounts to wastage of blood,“ said Dr Ramesh Reddy, superintendent of Niloufer hospital.
