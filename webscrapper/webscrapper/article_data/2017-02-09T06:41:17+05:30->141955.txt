SURAT: Top officials of   (VNSGU) were helpless when a peer team of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) could not read through presentation of vice-chancellor (VC) during its recent visit.   awards accreditation and grade to universities and is considered to be the most important exercise held once in every five years.

 VC’s presentation is one of the most important aspects of the entire report submitted to NAAC peer team. The presentation gives an overall picture of university. The report was prepared by computer science department of VNSGU and was presented by pro vice-chancellor   to the committee.
 
 During the presentation some committee members pointed out that they could not read clearly from the presentation slides on projector screen hence attempts were made to enlarge the fonts but the varsity officials did not succeed. Later, the committee members also pointed out that too much colours were used in the slides that gave the presentation a strange look. The committee suggested that the presentation should be more sober. 
 
 Top university officials informed that majority of the important points were covered in the presentation and it was good content wise but there were major lapses on part of packaging. “The presentation was confusing and was made too much flashy with lots of colours,” said an official.
 
 VNSGU is aiming to get ‘A’ grade this year and as per the experts from the field the varsity will get it considering the overall infrastructure development and academic facilities.
