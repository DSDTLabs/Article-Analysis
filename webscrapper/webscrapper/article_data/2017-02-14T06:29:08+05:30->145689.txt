MUMBAI: City Congress chief   on Monday expelled 25 activists from the party for six years for   for putting up nominations as rebel candidates.

 “Despite a warning, these activists filed nomination papers for the BMC polls against the official Congress candidates,'' Nirupam said. “ As per the laid-down guidelines, the party decided to expel them from Congress for six years.“
 
 The expelled Congress lea ders include councillor Gulista Shaikh, former councillors Raghunath Thawari, Baldev Manku, Seva Dal president Ramesh Raipalli, Mumbai Congress secretaries Deepak Kale and Ahad Khan and education committee member Vijay Kamble.
 
 As no understanding was reached between Congress and Sharad Pawar-led NCP , Nirupam decided to contest all the 227 seats. “Since NCP declared the list without even consulting the Congress, we had no option but to contest all the seats. There was massive response, as a record number of 2,200 Congress activists had sought nomination,“ said Nirupam.
 
 He said that the Mumbai Congress Committee had followed the procedure laid down by the AICC while selecting the nominees. “Most of the nominees were short-listed at the district level and only those cases, where there was a dispute, were brought to the notice of the Mumbai Congress Committee. We accommodated all sections and considered recommendations made by all former MPs, legislators and senior Congress leaders,“ said Niru pam.
 
 Nirupam claimed that despite rebellion, which was of very small magnitude, Congress will improve its performance.“In view of the split between Sena and BJP , Congress will benefit. I am sure, we will secure a large number of seats, much more than what Congress had in the 2012 elections,“ he said.
 
 On the campaign, Nirupam said it has gathered momentum. “Besides most of the leaders in Mumbai and former chief ministers, a section of AICC Congress leaders will join the campaign,“ he said.
