GUWAHATI: Police on Tuesday submitted a 'part'   in the   (APSC) cash-for-job scam before the special judges' court here. 

 In the chargesheet, police have primarily named 10 people as the key accused, including former commission chairman Rakesh Paul and members Samedur Rahman and Bosanta Doley.
 
 Of the 10, eight have already been arrested and two - Paul's brother Rajeev whose press was used to print APSC 'master' copies of answer scripts and Sudip Das who collected money from candidates on Paul's behalf - have been declared absconding.
 
 The chargesheet was filed 85 days after police registered a case following the arrest of assistant engineer of Dibrugarh's town and country planning department, Nabakanta Patir, for taking a bribe.
 
 Investigations have revealed that Paul allegedly collected between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 40 lakh from each candidate in exchange of government posts. 
 
 "Answer scripts containing enhanced marks and bearing the signature of invigilators as well as tabulation sheets were seized during raids at Paul's residence. A telephonic conversation between Paul and Patir revealed that the post of a BDO would fetch him Rs 40 lakh," police sources said.
 
 Police sought more time from the court to probe the case. The court, which granted the request, has sought the status report of the case by February 27. The court also rejected the bail plea of Samedur Rahman's personal security officer Mabud Ali Choudhury.
