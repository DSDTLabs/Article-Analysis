GURUGRAM: The main petitioner in the   land   case,  , who has spent nearly five years running around courtrooms, is not quite happy with the Supreme Court judgment, saying it put the onus for compensation on the government, which will inevitably require recipients to spend more time running around government offices and courtrooms to retrieve their fair share.

 The Supreme Court, in its judgment on the Manesar   scam, said while the land would not be returned to the landlords, they will be eligible for revised compensation, resting the responsibility of fixing and disbursing the compensation on the state government. 
 
 “We’ve spent a better part of our lives running around courts just because of this land deal. After spending five years fighting the case, we’ll now have to run around government offices to get our fair share of compensation,” said Yadav. He added if the compensation doesn’t match their expectations, they will again have to appeal to court. 
 
 “Our lands were acquired following the archaic British-era Land Acquisition Act, 1894. We had appealed to be compensated as per the 2013 Act, but this did not happen,” said Naresh Yadav, another petitioner. 
 
 The landlords were also unhappy with the observation that their claims had to be verified by HSIIDC and Huda, alleging this will require several more trips to government offices, and add to their agony. They said they plan to hold a panchayat in a couple of days to decide future course of action.
