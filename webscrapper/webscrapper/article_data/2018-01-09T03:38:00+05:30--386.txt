Panaji: The government has extended its contract with the United India Insurance Company Limited by three months for its universal mediclaim scheme, Deen Dayal Swashtya Seva Yojana (DDSSY). The scheme is currently under review before it is renewed for one year.  Health minister Vishwajit Rane told TOI the government is still in the process of reviewing the scheme and that the next meeting in the matter has been fixed for Wednesday. “All pros and cons are being examined before the scheme, introduced with the intention of providing better healthcare for the people of Goa, is renewed for another year,” he said. The review was slated to be completed in December, before the agreement, with some changes, was extended. This is the second extension granted to the scheme. The first extension was granted in October. The government pays Rs 80 crore as insurance premium for the scheme, which covers the entire population of Goa. Sources said once it is renewed, the premium is likely to rise to Rs 100 crore. The scheme currently covers 447 interventions. More are likely to be added upon renewal.  A source said empanelled hospitals have been demanding a higher rate for the enlisted interventions.  The flagship insurance scheme was introduced by the previous BJP-led government in 2016, after much deliberations and meetings spread over a year. Initially, though the government had not opened all procedures to private hospitals, it agreed to do so after they prevailed over it. A government official said the scheme needed to be tightened even though it was a good decision to open all procedures for private hospitals, as it meant the pressure on the GMC for tertiary care was reduced.
