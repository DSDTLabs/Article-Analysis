TIRUVANNAMALAI: An emerald   and other valuables have been stolen from the centuries-old Manonmaniam temple atop a hill in a village in   district of  .

 The robbery came to light when the priest, Mahendra Bandari, went to temple in Zamin Kudalur village near Vettavalam to perform poojas on Monday morning, police said. The temple was built and maintained by the Vettavalam Zamin. 
 
 The priest found the sanctum sanctorum broken open. The   lingam (lingam carved out of emerald), a gold thali of Amman and silver ornaments of other deities were found missing from the safe box (pettagam) in the sanctum sanctorum.
 
 The priest alerted the family members of the Zamin who in turn alerted police. Tiruvannamalai assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Ravali Priya Gandhanpuneni and a team of police personnel rushed to the spot and conducted an inquiry.
 
 Police officials said they were yet to receive a list of properties that were stolen from the temple.
 
 Sources in the police department said this was for the second time that the lingam has been stolen from the temple. "The lingam was first stolen 30 years ago, in April 1987. The department recovered it from the robbers in November that year and handed it over to the Zamin family," said the ASP.
 
 The police department had sent letter twice to the Zamin family, asking them to keep the precious lingam in a safe custody. "The department clearly communicated to the Zamin family that the temple was not a safe place to keep the emerald lingam. But they ignored our advice," he added.
