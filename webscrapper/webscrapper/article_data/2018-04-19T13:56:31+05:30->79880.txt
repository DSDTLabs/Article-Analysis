NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday 
  into the death of judge B H   in December 2014, who was at the time trying the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case. BJP president   was an accused in the case and was eventually acquitted.

 
 Loya died allegedly of cardiac arrest on December 1, 2014 in Nagpur where he had gone to attend the wedding of a colleague's daughter. A batch of pleas, including those filed by Congress leader Tehseen Poonawala and Maharashtra-based B S Lone, was filed in the top court seeking an independent probe into judge’s death.
 
 
 
 
 In a scathing attack, the court called the petition ‘frivolous’ and said it was an attempt to malign the judiciary. 
 
 Here are the highlights of what the   said in its judgment:
 
 * Completely frivolous petition brought in a motivated manner to denigrate judiciary
 
 * PIL ‘bereft of any truth’ 
 
 * Attempts were made to scandalise judiciary by levelling serious allegations against judicial officers and judges of Bombay HC
 
 * Judge Loya died of natural causes and there was ‘not a shred of doubt about it’
 
 * Advocates of the petitioners launched a frontal attack on the judiciary by egging the SC to disbelieve the three judicial officers who accompanied Loya to Nagpur and stayed with him at a guest house and said the judge died of a heart attack
 
 * No reason to doubt statements of four judges on circumstances leading to the death of Loya
 
 * Should initiate contempt proceedings against the petitioner in such a case where a ‘political rivalry is brought to court to malign judiciary’
 
 * During arguments, counsel forgot to maintain institutional civility towards SC judges and made wild allegations
 
 * PILs which are meant to provide succour to downtrodden and voiceless have now become an industry to settle business and political rivalry
 
 * When Loya matter was brought to the SC, a magazine and a daily newspaper published motivated reports to malign judiciary
 
 * These days an avalanche of PILs are being filed to settle business and political scores and the judiciary is unnecessarily made to spend precious time looking into such PILs which leads to delay in giving justice in other cases
 
 * Courts are not the place to settle business or political rivalry, which should be fought in markets or in elections.
