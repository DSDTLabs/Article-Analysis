KOHIMA: Nagaland Chief Minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu said Nagas need to be united and speak in one voice to enable the Centre to understand the need for a lasting solution to the decades-old Naga  .

 "Any political problem needs a human approach for resolution and the Naga problem, though political in nature is very much a human problem and needs a human approach to bring about a lasting and  ," he said addressing a civic reception at   in Mokokchung district.
 
 Nagas have been striving for almost seven decades for a common cause but were now fragmented into several groups, he said and stressed on the need for Nagas to be united.
 
 The chief minister also emphasised on determination to solve the Naga problem and urged the people not to bequeath it to future generations. This should be a priority for the Nagas, specially when the Centre has taken "a bold step to solve the problem once and for all".
 
 Calling for unity among the Nagas, Shurhozelie said blaming each other will not bring it. "Nagas have to start unity from home, clan, village and different tribes."
 
 Accepting that there may be differences of principle leading to   between Naga groups, he said such differences should not lead to fights against each other. "From now on we have to start a movement to bring unity among the Nagas to achieve the ultimate goal of bringing a solution to the protracted Naga political problem," he added.
