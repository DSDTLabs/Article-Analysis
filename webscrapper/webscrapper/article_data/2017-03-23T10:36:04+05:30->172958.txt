HYDERABAD: The city might not have any direct connectivity with the US, yet several passengers flying to the other end of the globe might now have to 'check-in' their   at the time of boarding their flight from here, much like those headed to the UK.

 The reason being the  ' recent move to ban devices such as tablets,  , laptops and cameras from being carried as  .The rule, implemented for `security' reasons, applies to passengers booked on nine carriers -Emirates, Etihad, Kuwait Airways, Qatar and Saudi Airways being among them ­ and flying out of certain countries including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Morocco and Qatar.
 
 “On the face of it, the move appears to be ridiculous. Travelling to these far away nations includes a lot of transit time that, professionals like me, spend getting work done. But if we aren't allowed to carry our laptops or i-pads then what are we going to do?“ asked Anoop Shastry, a senior-level executive with a city advertising firm.
 
 There is heavy traffic to the Gulf countries from Hyderabad, which has multiple services to destinations such as Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi.From there people continue their onward journey either to Europe or the US. The most sought-after airlines are Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways.
 
 “While until a few years ago about 50% of the travellers ago about 50% of the travellers opted for the national carrier Air India, things have changed now. The other three airlines now capture over 80% of the market in Hyderabad,“ said Abdul Majid Faheem, chairman, Travel Agents Federation of India (AP & Telangana chapter). Though city travel agents are still awaiting official communication from carriers to ascertain the impact of the rule, they fear that the rates of the other service providers ­ AI, British Airways or even Cathay Pacific, might take a northward turn owing to it.
