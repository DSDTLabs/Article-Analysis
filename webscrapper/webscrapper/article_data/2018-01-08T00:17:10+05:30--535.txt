Madurai: Amid hundreds of pious devotees at the Alagarkovil in Madurai district, fans of actor Rajinikanth thronged on a Sunday to celebrate their matinee idol’s recently announced political plunge. What charged up the already elated fans was the presence of one of the prominent fans of Rajinikanth. It was none other than actor Raghava Lawrence. While the absence of their Thaivar created a vaccum for the fans, the presence of Rajini lookalikes however consoled them to an extent. They stole the show with the makeovers from the Rajini’s hit flicks Sivaji and Kabali. Even as the captivating star is yet to form his party, the reverent fans raised slogans hailing him as future CM of the state. The enthralled fans kept surrounding Raghava Lawrence, the chief guest of the celebration. He could not even move around freely to distribute the welfare measures to be given to the selected beneficiaries. He would have wished to serve the food, an elaborate non-veg banquet organized by the fan’s club, but due to the overwhelming crowd, he had to cut short his presence. The mega banquet was prepared using over 200 kgs of chicken and equal quantity of mutton. As many as 1000 eggs were also served along with the meal. The human size garland, which was specially prepared for the chief guest, adorned him just for a few minutes. In another moment it was seen taken away along the ground by a couple of fans.
