SHIMLA: Barely three months ahead of the assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh, a   of the schoolgirl’s rape and murder case is threatening to split the state Congress unit. Six Congress MLAs have written to the party high command, seeking removal of chief minister   Singh for failing to control things and generating lots of resentment against the government. 

 Sources said the MLAs in the letter have suggested that the party high command change the leadership in the state government. The letter has come days after senior leader Major Vijai Singh Mankotia’s tirade against Virbhadra on corruption. 
 
 Pradesh Congress Committe president Sukhwinder Sukhu confirmed that six MLAs had written to the party high command but refused to divulge more details. He said it was an internal matter of the party and the problem would be sorted out after talking to the disgruntled party leaders.
 
 Sources said that Kotkhai incident has added to feud within the Congress and the rival faction is trying to build pressure on the high command to act against Virbhadra. Congress has launched “Mission Repeat” campaign ahead of the coming assembly election, but many feel the latest feud could harm the party’s poll prospects.
 
 Virbhadra is already under the fire of opposition over the corruption cases against him and his family members. The latest gangrape case and the subsequent custodial death of one of the accused has created a lot of resentment against the government, especially against the chief minister.
