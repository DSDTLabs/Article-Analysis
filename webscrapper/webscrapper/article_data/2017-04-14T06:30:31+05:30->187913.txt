LUCKNOW: The Christian community observed   in the city by organising mass services in churches. Maundy Thursday marks the day Jesus Christ shared the Last Supper with his 12 disciples and washed their feet.

 Devotees observed the ‘washing of the feet’ tradition which signifies the act of humility, while the inclusion of bread and wine in the tradition signifies the Lord’s flesh and blood which he sacrificed for his people.
 
 Bishop Gerald Mathias delivered a sermon at St Joseph’s Cathedral Church.
 
 Meanwhile, in his message for Good Friday, Reverend Father Donald De Souza, chancellor, Diocese of Lucknow, said that   is the day when Christians remember the suffering and death of Jesus Christ on the   for the salvation of humankind. “The redeeming death on a Cross for the sins of humankind and the Resurrection from death forms the foundation of Christian Faith,” he said.
