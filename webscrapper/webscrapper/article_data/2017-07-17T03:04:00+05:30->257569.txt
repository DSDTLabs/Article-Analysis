Bicholim: Increasing stray cattle loitering on roads has led to a spike in the number of accidents on the Bicholim-Sakhali highway and is a cause for concern among local residents, said president of Janahit Rakshak Manch Santosh Chari. Chari said his organisation has, in the past, attempted to create awareness among cattle owners to not leave animals on the road, but in vain. The organisation has urged the state to step in.  Lately, there has been a rise in the number of cattle on the the busy Bicholim-Sakhali road which is a part of NH 17. The strays lead to traffic obstructions. Several accidents have taken place, especially at night, with two-wheeler riders being unable to spot the animals. “The cattle sit right in the middle of the road and two-wheeler riders cannot see them in the dark, leading to accidents,” said Karapur-resident Vinay Mathkar. Chari said they did not get much support from authorities in their mission and demanded that panchayat, municipality or PWD authorities take necessary measures.
