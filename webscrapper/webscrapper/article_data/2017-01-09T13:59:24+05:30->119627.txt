Bimal Roy, the man behind classics like 'Do Bigha Zamin', 'Parineeta', 'Sujata', and 'Bandini', now has a road in Bandra named after him  . It was inaugurated on his 51st death anniversary on January 8 by  . The signboard has been designed by  's brother, Alan.

 Bimal Roy's son, Joy, who has lived on   all his life, still finds it hard to believe that a part of the road has been named after his father who moved there in 1954. "It was an important time in his life because that's when he started his first production, 'Do Bigha Zamin'. It's a huge honour," he exults, recalling that his father was so unhappy with the way 'Kabuliwala' had been shot that he spent the Rs two lakh in his bank account to re-shoot the film, reasoning that he couldn't release a film he was unhappy with.
 
 The family had been trying to get the road named after Roy when   was MP. After he passed away, it was passed to his daughter, Priya, along with MLA   and Councillor  . "Six months ago, I learnt that there's a proposal in the BMC to name the road after my father," he informs.
