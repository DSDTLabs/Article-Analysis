Ludhiana: “Lack of standardized infrastructure for cricket in this indsutrial town has become one of the major reasons no new cricketers from Ludhiana make it to the Indian Premier League or even ​to the last session of Punjab Ranji Trophy matches,” commented Ankur Kakkar, former Ranji Trophy player from the district, who expressed his disappointment over the ongoing controversy between ex-cricketers and officiating members of the district cricket body.

 Kakkar, who played near about 50 Ranji Trophy matches for Punjab, claimed: “Ludhiana cricket suffered a lot in past several years due to internal issues between office-bearers of the Ludhiana District Cricket Association (LDCA) and former players, due to which cricketing infrastructure could not develop here. Once there was a time Ranji Trophy level matches were being held in the city, but now the condition is so pathetic that we cannot find a standardized cricket ground for the young brigade, who are playing cricket these days.”
 
 He continued: “Even I have passed through the whole selection process. If a city youth wants to become a national or state-level player, then the conditions in the district are not suitable for their development, because cricket has gone into the hands of some self-interested players. Because of this, even ex-cricketers have not seen a single development.”
 
 Elaborating on the issue, the first cricketer from Ludhiana nominated for the Indian Premier League matches due to his successive performances in the Ranji Trophy, Karan Goel, exclaimed: “I have been the first player from the district who qualified for IPL matches in 2008, but the present scenario for cricket in the district is originates the positive waves for the young brigade who have the dreams to represent the Punjab or nation because non-availability of proper infrastructure remains in the centre of everything. The number of participants in cricket academies have increased in the recent past, but no well-developed cricket ground, no well modern clubs have been developed in the business city to promote the city, responsible bodies remains fails to developed best of their standard as of this from past three to four years none of the players from Ludhiana have qualifies for the Indian premier league matches, said Karan Goel, former IPL players from district.
 
 Another Ranji Trophy player from the business city Satish Mangal, excalimed that, if we talk about the overall number of players which have represented the Punjab cricket team in Ranji trophy matches till now date than ludhiana stands no-where in the queue because Ludhiana has produced least number of Ranji trophy and Indian premiers leagues players due to lack of cricket resources.if any cricketer from district would like to succeeded in cricket worild than he/she would have its own practice wickets or other useful resources because the responisbale authorities have remained failed to update the cricekt infrastructure in the district which leads to downfall of cricket players in the state or national level tournaments, said another Ranji Trophy Player from district.
