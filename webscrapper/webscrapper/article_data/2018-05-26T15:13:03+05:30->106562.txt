VADODARA: Soon, whenever a fatal accident occurs in any area of the city, a specially-designed police van will rush to the spot. The team travelling in the van will gather all the details of the accident including photographs and reasons behind the victim’s death. They will then prepare a report and submit it to the police department. 

 
 “We have prepared a special team that will collect details and analyse the fatal accidents. It has been named RASTA,” said Amita Vanani, ACP (traffic). His team will consist of one police sub-inspector ( ) and two constables from the police department,   (VMC) officials and regional transport office (RTO) officials. The presence of civic officials will help in understanding and solving faults, if any, in road design.
 
 This team will carry a kit for conducting the analysis. Every member of this team will be given a smart phone that will have a mobile app of the specially-designed software installed in it. 
 
 The kit will have measurement tapes, boundary line tapes and other necessary equipment. The police said that the idea was to give quick response after the fatal accidents and work out solutions as early as possible.
