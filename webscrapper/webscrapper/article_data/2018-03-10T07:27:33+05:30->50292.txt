LUCKNOW: There seem to be few aspirants for Lucknow   MBA courses. After receiving less applications than the number of seats,   has extended the last date for submission of MBA application forms for the third time.

 University officials said that students have lost interest in the course due to poor placement, less job opportunities and change in market trend. LU received only 166 applications till date against the 540 seats in its six MBA courses.
 
  
  
 
 “The main reason for less number of applications is lack of good job opportunities for MBA graduates. It’s a changing trend where students are shifting from MBA and engineering courses to law and humanities,” said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh. It’s an expensive course with low placement opportunities hence students prefer other courses like law and pharmacy which are currently in demand, he added.
 
 “Poor placement is one of the main reasons for less applications. Last year only 30% students pursuing MBA from LU could be placed and even the packages offered to them were not very high,” said an LU official.
 
 Earlier, LU had rolled back its decision of making CAT mandatory for admission to its MBA courses. The last date for admission forms was changed from January 31 to February 28 after the university received only 75 application from CAT scorers even though it has 540 MBA seats.
