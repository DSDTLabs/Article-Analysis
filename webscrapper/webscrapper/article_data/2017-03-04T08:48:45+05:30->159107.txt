 The matter came to light when he molested a 33-year-old woman, who travels to work regularly from Airoli railway station. The woman was rushing to board a train when Gaikwad came close to her, flashed her and rubbed against her before disappearing into the crowd. The woman immediately called up the helpline numbers of the Government Railway Police (GRP) and RPF.
 
 In the subsequent days, the woman noticed that the man would come to the station each day between 9 am and 11 am and act similarly with different women commuters and make use of the enormous crowds to disappear. She then managed to shoot a short video of his action as proof and sent it to the railway police.
 
 After receiving the complaint, the RPF swung deployed two teams at the railway station to look for the man. On Friday morning, a decoy team of two constables Nilesh Dalvi and Radheshyam spotted Gaikwad at the subway of Airoli railway station. The two waited until he harassed another woman commuter and immediately nabbed him.
 
 Gaikwad worked as a licensed labourer (head loader). The inspector in-charge of RPF at Turbhe, Lokesh Sagar called the woman who had complained to identify him and then handed him over to the GRP. A complaint has been registered under Section 354 (Assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code. An RPF official said, “Gaikwad lived with his family in Airoli village. They came to the police station when they heard about his arrest. His wife refused to believe his crime until we showed her the video shot by the complainant.”
