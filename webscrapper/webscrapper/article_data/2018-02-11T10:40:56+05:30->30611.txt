SILCHAR: Responding to a recent memorandum submitted by joint action committee of recognized unions of   and   owned by state-run Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited, the Presidential secretariat in a letter has asked the secretary to the department of public enterprise to take action immediately to ensure the re-opening of these mills and clear the dues of the workers. 

 The memorandum to President   had stated that the Cachar Paper Mill has remained closed since Oct 2015 and the Nagaon Paper Mill since March 2017, leaving at least 2 lakh workers jobless and the rural economy of the state severely affected. 
 
 The workers and employees have been deprived of their salaries and statutory dues, the memorandum said, adding that the Prime Minister had given his commitment to re-open these mills but the matter has remained unresolved because of lack of decision-making on the part of the Union government.
 
 "The unions hope that since the government is duty-bound to honour the directive of  , it will act promptly to save the industries and the affected peoples who are on the brink of starvation due to non-payment of dues. They have also been compelled to seek permission from the President to commit suicide if the crisis is not resolve immediately," said  , president of the INTUC-affiliated Cachar Paper Mill workers union on Saturday.
