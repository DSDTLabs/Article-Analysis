ALAPPUZHA: Yet another senior   has come up with   on how women can avoid being raped. Known to possess more gravitas than his cabinet colleague  , minister for public works   said that if more men were to engage in farming and if women became less obsessed with mobile phones, the number of rape cases would come down. He proffered the insights while inaugurating the renovated office building of the district child welfare committee here on Saturday.

 Explaining the link between farming and the reduced number of rapes, the minister said a farmer seldom gets time to abuse women. “He will be busy with farming and won’t get time even to think of rape,” he said.
 
 Rapping women who use mobile phones while walking on the roads, Sudhakaran said such women were not conscious about their surroundings. “Anti-social elements use such opportunities,” he said.
 
 Advocating the need for society to practise self-control, Sudhakaran suggested that local self-government institutions should intervene and teach people the need for self-control. “The state government and police alone cannot make society exercise restraint if the people are not ready to understand its relevance,” he said.
 
 He blamed the media for “rumours that Kerala was not safe for women and children. It’s wrong,” Sudhakaran said. According to the state police’s provisional crime statistics, as many as 16,960 cases of crime against women and children, including 2,568 rapes, were reported in 2016.
 
 Of the total rape cases in 2016, women were targeted in 1,644 cases while children were targeted in 924 cases, higher than the reported 1,263 and 720 cases, respectively, in 2015.
