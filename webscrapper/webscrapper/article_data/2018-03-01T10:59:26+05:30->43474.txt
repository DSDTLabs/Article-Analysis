PANAJI: Beginning from the new academic year,   merit marks will be granted to students at the Class X and XII public examinations. Such marks, however, will only be granted to students who participate in events approved by the art and culture department, chairman of the   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Ramkrishna  , said. 
 
 Certificates of participation will also have to be authenticated by the directorate of art and culture if the student concerned is to be eligible for cultural marks, Samant said. 
  
 In May 2017, art and culture minister   had announced plans to introduce cultural merit marks for students from Classes I-XII along the lines of sports merit marks. Though   had proposed to introduce the scheme from the current academic year 2017-18, the Goa Board had advised the government against implementing it in a haste, at least in the case of classes IX to XII. 
  
 Just as students participating in sports activities are granted merit marks for their participation and achievements, the contribution of students engaging in art and culture will also get recognition in the forms of marks from the academic year 2018-19. 
  
 The state is presently in the process of preparing a policy in this regard with inputs from the Goa Board, directorate of youth affairs, art and culture department, and other stakeholders. 
  
 Organisations such as the Goa Konkani Akademi, Goa Marathi Akademi, Kala Academy, Ravindra Bhavan and Rajiv Kala Mandir among others, are likely to be approved by the state government. Participation in cultural events held only by these organisations will be recognised for allotment of merit marks. 
  
 The final scheme on allotment of marks and concessions will require the approval of the boardâ€™s executive council and later, its general body. Only then can implementation begin.
