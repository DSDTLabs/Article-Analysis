PATNA: Miffed with the indifference of bankers towards the Bihar government’s ambitious students’ credit card ( ) scheme, the state cabinet on Saturday gave its nod to the formation of a Bihar State Education   Corporation (BSEFC) for providing loan to students up to Rs 4 lakh under the scheme.

 The BSEFC, to be headed by a chief executive officer -cum-managing director, will have 131 officials and employees. The cabinet also okayed fixation of honorarium for them. The CEO-cum-MD with be given a monthly honorarium of Rs 2.5 lakh. His deputy — general manager (administration) — will get an honorarium of Rs 2 lakh per month. “The BSEFC is being formed because the bankers were apathetic to the SCC scheme,” said cabinet secretariat department’s special secretary U N Pandey.
 
 Since the launch of the scheme on October 2, 2016 by CM  , 30,000 applications were received from students for loan assistance. However, loans could be given only to 412 applicants. Pandey said the corporation would start functioning from April 1 this year. It will have equity share of Rs 9.5 crore.
