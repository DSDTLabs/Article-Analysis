Looks like the dispute between   — producer of the TV show, ' ' — and   (Cine and Television Artistes’ Association) isn’t likely to end soon. Last year, the association had issued a non-cooperation directive against Meenakshi, alleging non-payment of dues to the artistes of her show like   and  , 
and later sued her for defamatory statements in the media. The show went off air in March 2017. 
 The latest development is that the Andheri Metropolitan Magistrate   has directed the police to conduct an inquiry against CINTAA. Advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, who represents Meenakshi, states, “CINTAA is a trade union and so, they have to follow the Trade Union Laws. In the complaint filed by my client, CINTAA was accused of threats, criminal intimidation and   and the Metropolitan Magistrate has ordered a police inquiry against the association under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. As far as the court summons issued to my client in a parallel criminal defamation complaint filed by CINTAA is concerned, we are already going in revision against the said order.” 
 
  
  
 Sushant Singh, General Secretary of CINTAA, says, “Initially, we had taken our members to the police to file an FIR against Meenakshi Sagar, but were told that it’s a civil matter. So, the members filed a motion against her and the court took cognisance of the matter. For us, it’s a win that the police will conduct the inquiry.” 
 Sushant termed the Non-Cooperation Directive issued against Sagar, which prevents other affiliated associations from working with her, symbolic. The directive, he says, didn’t stop her from making other shows. “It was important to go to court because she has been a regular defaulter. Her company is not paying artistes their due because they are CINTAA members. Now, let the court decide.”
