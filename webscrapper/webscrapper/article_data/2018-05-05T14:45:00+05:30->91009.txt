JAIPUR: Subhash Gopinath, a student of Hilton School in Tenkasi Municipality in Tirunelveli district in   had to cover 3100 kms to reach Udaipur with his father Arun Gopinath and his friend on Friday afternoon. Gopinath had prepared for   in his home town but due to an unfortunate turn of events he had to come to Udaipur to take the test. He had applied for three exam centres- Tirunelveli, Madurai and Tiruchirappalli- in TN but was allotted a center in Udaipur which is 2311 kms from Chennai.

 He was in disbelief until he checked the location of the exam center on google and was shocked.
 
 “I’ve been travelling since the morning of May 3. It took 15 hours to reach Chennai from my home town. I am not in a position to say anything and I want to focus on my revision,” said Gopinath, while adding that around 15 students from his home district got Udaipur as their exam centre.
 
 The trio travelled to   for the first time. They have heard that Hindi is the prominent language in North India but were not expecting that very few people will understand English. “None of us know even a word of Hindi other than few one-liners like, tumhara naam kya hai (what is your name) which we learnt watching Hindi movies. People are helping us in conversing with locals like auto rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers on our behalf.”
 
 The family will end up spending Rs 50,000 by the time they reach their native town. “I paid around Rs 40,000 on flights and an added Rs 10,000 will be spent on the stay and food in Udaipur for three days,” said a disappointed Arun.
