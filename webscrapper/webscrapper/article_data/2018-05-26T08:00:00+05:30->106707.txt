While people can't stop raving about  's impeccable style, we can't get over her latest hairstyle - the beach babe waves or the classic no-fuss look that is super cool.

 And, if you are wondering what it takes to get the hairstyle, you have certainly come to the right place! Beach babe waves are nothing but large, shiny waves that you can wear to a luxurious party or with jeans and a tee and all it takes is three simple tips to nail this look:
 
 
 
 Begin by blowing out your hair until they are almost dry. Even if your locks are naturally straight, you want a smooth, sleek base before you start curling.
 
 
 
 Add a texturizing spray. This is self-setting, so best advice is to put down the hairspray. You want your hair to be free-flowing.
 
 
 
 Perfect your curling technique. When it comes to creating waves, it's all about how you use your curling tongs. For a look like Kareena's, use tongs with a jumbo barrel. Don't open the clamp but instead, wrap big sections of hair around the barrel, starting approximately six inches from your crown and twirling away from your face. You should hold the tongs pointing down and parallel to your head for the best shape. Allow it to set for a few seconds, let it fall off the barrel, then hold the wave in your hand until it cools.
