PATNA:   district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Sunday said action will be taken against 550 government schoolteachers working in different schools in the district for dereliction of duty.

 During a review meeting with the education department officials, the DM said some of the teachers have not been taking classes for five years, but still getting all the government benefits.
 
 The DM has asked the executive officers to explain why action had not been taken against the   teachers.
 
 Officials said at least 300 teachers had submitted their resignations to the urban local bodies. The ULBs, however, rejected their resignation letters and let them continue to draw salary without taking classes.
