 I am a 28-year-old woman. I have had my share of unpleasant relationships, but right now I am   and waiting for the right guy in my life. There was a guy in my college, who pursued me for a long time, but I never felt the same way for him. Recently, he approached me again and is back to pursuing me. I am strangely not shunning him completely this time and cannot even decide my   for him. He doesn't stimulate me intellectually and it's difficult to have a conversation with him, but then I do not understand why I'm unable to completely get rid of him.
 
  I respond to him as per my whims and fancies, without really giving him signs of any possibility of a relationship. But I fear he might be seeing some hope. How should I deal with this? 
 
  
  
  Well, it’s very clear that you don't seem to be attracted to this man at all. Sometimes, when we are slightly muddled up with certain issues in our lives we tend to cling to certain feelings and emotions that could be attached to a particular person or situation. Introspection will really help in your predicament, sit down and ask yourself that maybe you are not shunning him because you are lonely at the moment or it’s an attempt to fill an empty void which is probably making you not letting this relationship go or maybe you are enjoying the attention he is giving you. Once you have more clarity, you can then have a friendly chat with him and clear the air. Let him know that you are defining this relationship not more than a healthy friendship without any romantic attachments. Respect his decision.
