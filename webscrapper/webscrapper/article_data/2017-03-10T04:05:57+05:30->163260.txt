NEW DELHI: The spate of racial attacks against Indians in the US - which have killed two and injured as many over the past month - came up for discussion in Lok Sabha on Thursday, with the opposition led by Congress leader   accusing the government of failing to devise a strategy to address the hate crimes and ensuring the safety and security of its citizens. 

 Expressing concern over the hate attacks in the US - which have claimed the lives of Indian techie Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Kansas and Harnish Patel in South Carolina, apart from injuring Ashok Madasani, also in Kansas, and Deep Rai in Kent (Washington state) - Kharge, Trinamool Congress's  , CPM's Mohammad Salim, BJD's   and others asked the government during zero hour to take up the issue with the US authorities at the highest level.
 
 Mahtab even suggested that a travel advisory be issued -- on the lines of US advisories asking its citizens to stay alert while visiting certain areas in India -- pinpointing the states in the US where they are more likely to face hate crimes.
 
 Home minister   sought to assure the House that the government was committed to ensuring the safety of its diaspora. 
 
 Earlier, raising the matter, Kharge wondered why PM Modi, who tweeted on every issue, was silent on hate attacks against Indians in the US.
