VARANASI: Targeting Prime Minister   in his parliamentary constituency, the leader of opposition in   and   general secretary, Gulam Nabi Azad, said, “Those, who do communal politics, should see the result of this kind of politics done by Muhammad Ali Jinnah.”

 Azad was addressing a seminar on `Idea of India- Indira’s contribution to it’, organized by the UP Congress Committee as part of its ongoing celebration of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s birth centenary at Naria area on Monday. He said that only those, who treat all caste and community equally, can be called a real leader. These qualities were there in Mahatma Gandhi, Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru and Indira, he said adding, “But, today our political leaders are not interested in becoming the leader of all. They should keep the result of Jinnah’s politics in mind.”
 
 Giving a rousing call to the partymen he said, “Those who think that they will become active in field after Congress will return to power should keep it in mind that power can’t be achieved by sitting at home. Go read the history of Congress. Gandhi, Nehru and India and jump into the field. Today not the Congress but an ideology, unity and integrity of the country are facing threat.” He asked the party leaders to stop lobbying and downsizing others as the party had already paid huge cost for it.
 
 Earlier, the Congress sympathizer and author Purushottam Agrawal, who was chief speaker at this seminar, gave a mantra to Congress workers to go among people and tell that mistakes are done by those who work. Earlier, UPCC chief   called upon the party men to take lesson from politics and achievements of Indira. Important among others Promod Tiwari, Sanjay Singh and Women Congress national president Sushmita Dave also addressed the seminar. They all condemned the police brutality on girl students of Banaras Hindu University and targeted   for avoiding the problems and agitation of BHU girl students.
