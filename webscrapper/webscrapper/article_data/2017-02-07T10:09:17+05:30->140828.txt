HYDERABAD: The planned infusion of over   into the state's nearly 1.2 crore sheep population is sending officials of the   into a tizzy. The challenge, they say, is feeding the animals and discouraging shepherds from continuing with  . 

 While each lamb requires very little in terms of feed, a fully-grown sheep requires one kilo of feed a day, officials said. "Ideally, each sheep should get a mix of legumes and non-legume plants for it to get the required carbohydrates and protein for healthy growth," an official said.
 
 However, a majority of the 24 lakh families involved in animal husbandry, including those who raise cattle and goats, are continuing with nomadic grazing of their animals. "A large number of shepherds own land. We are asking them to raise fodder for their animals there. But in most cases, they use the land to grow cash crops and hire hands to graze their sheep," the official said.
 
 If grazing by animals - be it cattle, goats or sheep - is not controlled, then additional measures may have to be taken to protect the saplings planted as part of the ambitious Harita Haram programme that aims to increase green cover in the state to 33% of the land area, officials fear. 
 
 The government is now reaching out to Yadava leaders and opinion makers to promote fodder plantations for animals. The   department is holding a meeting with the Yadava community leaders on Tuesday to impress upon them the need to stop using their land for cash crops and instead begin raising fodder.
