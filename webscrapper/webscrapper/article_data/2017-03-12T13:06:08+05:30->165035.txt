BAREILLY: Riot-scarred Muzaffarnagar, where BJP had failed to open its account in the 2012 assembly polls and won just one seat in a bypoll later, registered victories in all six seats of the district. Not only that, the saffron party also wrested the Muslim-dominated Deoband seat in neighbouring Saharanpur from Congress. It was BSP, in fact, that came second here, losing to BJP by 30,000 votes.

 Vikram Saini, who was arrested under the National Security Act for his role in 2014's riots in Kawal village of the district and later released, registered the most emphatic victory in Muzaffarnagar with a margin of over 30,000 votes.
 
 Surprisingly, the party smoothly marked victory on those seats where Jat voters are in sizable numbers. Overwhelmed by his party's tremendous victory in the district as well as the state, Union minister   told TOI, “Our party gave ticket to 15 Jat candidates in the region and 13 of them won. It proves that Jats are still with BJP.“
