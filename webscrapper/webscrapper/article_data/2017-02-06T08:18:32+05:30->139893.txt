BENGALURU: Opposition parties might find it difficult to put the government on the mat during a  . For, the  , a procedure that allows for setting aside normal business of the house to discuss an urgent matter of public importance, is all set to be redefined. 

 Henceforth, only issues where the government's failure is clear will be allowed to taken up under an adjournment motion. "This is being done to streamline legislature proceedings and make debates more meaningful and effective," assembly secretary S   said. The change will come into effect in the session starting Monday.
 
 The primary motive behind an adjournment motion is to draw the house's attention to an issue which affects most people and the state as a whole. But the reality has been different as MLAs, especially those from the opposition, use the motion to raise issues which affect smaller groups or are not urgent.
 
 Murthy said: "This affects business of the house as we need to set aside the schedule to accommodate adjournment motions. In this backdrop, we have decided to allow only those motions where the government has failed badly." He did not specify the parameters that will determine how and where the government has failed.
