AMRAVATI: Firebrand MLA   said that farmers will stage a ‘Dera Andolan’ before   in the state on May 10 to pressure the government to buy tur dal.

 Lashing out at the state government for its ‘anti-farmer’ stance in not buying tur from the farmers despite the bumper crop this season, Kadu said that on May 10, coinciding with Buddha Jayanti, farmers would reach APMCs in the state with their produce and stage a sit-in there to force the government buy tur dal.
