MEERUT: Nearly 1,500 doctors in the city, under the banner of   ( ), observed   on Thursday to protest against the   Clinical Establishment (Registration, Regulation and Transparency) Act, 2017 by donning black ribbons on their arm. Doctors say this will lead to corporatization of health care and hit small health care units.
 
  The Act will eradicate the concept of “home visits” and “free check-ups” as doctors will not be able to render services anywhere else except their registered clinics, the doctors said while expressing their solidarity against the Act here in Meerut.
  
  “Doctors across the country from as many as 1,765 units of IMA staged protests against the Clinical Establishment Act on Thursday. To mark our disagreement with the Act, which has been passed in West Bengal, all the doctors under the banner of IMA tied black ribbons on their arms while working,” said Dr  , president, Meerut IMA unit.
  
  The Act requires doctors, including specialists, to make arrangements for emergency equipment at their respective facilities. Doctors have questioned who is going to bear the cost of these equipment. Besides, not all doctors are trained to handle every kind of emergency.
  
  “As this Act comes into force, patients as well as doctors will be harassed and it will give a push to inspector and licence raj. This will also make treatment more costly for the patients,” said Tomar.
  
  According to the Act, each clinic should have one nurse and a pharmacist despite the fact that in a 2010 report of WHO had revealed that India is grappling with a shortage of medical staff, including 24 lakh nurses.
