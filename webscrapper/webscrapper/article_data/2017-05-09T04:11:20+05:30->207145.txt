New Delhi:   on Monday suspended   and alleged that he was acting on the behest of BJP as part of a “big conspiracy”.

 Chief minister Arvind   didn’t react on the day’s happenings beyond tweeting that “truth will win and a beginning will be made on Tuesday at the Vidhan Sabha special session”. But other senior leaders attacked Mishra sharply at a press conference held after Mishra had submitted documents to ACB to back his charge that Kejriwal had delayed the probe into a Rs 400-crore tanker “scam”. 
 
 AAP leader Sanjay Singh said at the presser that Mishra was making one allegation after another without any substance or proof. “We want to ask if at what time he went to the CM’s residence since he claims to have been there and seen the CM take   from  ,” Singh said. 
 
 Hitting out at Mishra over the allegations of corruption, Singh produced a letter and claimed it was written by Mishra to ACB last September, saying that the anti-graft body was trying to implicate Kejriwal in the tanker scam even though his name was not mentioned in the evidence. 
 
 “AAP can never compromise with corruption. And now they (BJP and Congress) are accusing us,” Singh said. He also said BJP and Congress had no moral right to raise questions about AAP’s honesty since many scams had occurred under their regimes. 
 
 “BJP and Congress are treating Mishra as Harishchandra. Let me remind BJP that he is the same person who had called Modi an ‘ISI agent’,” Singh said, throwing a dare at the BJP-led government to use all its probing agencies to investigate allegations against AAP and throw the leaders in jail if they find proof. 
 
 Earlier in the day, Dilip Pandey said Mishra was removed as minister since there were complaints of problems in managing water, and MLAs from across the city had been complaining about it.
