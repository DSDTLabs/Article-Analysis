Kolkata: An edge-of-the-seat thriller is playing out in the   area where a young police officer who played an important role in arresting the prime accused in one of the most shocking case of police murder has taken over as the head of the division.

 Syed Waquar Raza was part of the CID team that had arrested fugitive Mohammad Iqbal Munna, a former Trinamool councillor and an accused in the murder of sub-inspector Tapas Chowdhury, from Dehri-on-Sone in Bihar in 2013. Raza took over as the deputy commissioner of the Port division last week. But veterans of the Port division, an administrative parlance for areas that include Khidderpore, Mominpore, Garden Reach and Metiabruz, feel that Raza’s assignment here won’t be a calkwalk as the dynamics have changed — Munna is out on bail and has regained his position of the Port satrap. His son is now the councillor of the ruling party.
 
 But Munna is up against a smart cop, say officers who have worked with Raza. Raza is from Begusarai in Bihar. A student of St Paul School in Barauni Refinery, he’s a bright student who cruised into the Joint Entrance Examination and later to IIT-Guwahati in 1999. Raza completed his engineering in electronic and communication in 2003 and the same year, he qualified for the preliminary test of the Union Public Service Commission. In 2006, he ranked 121th in the IPS.
 
 But academic accomplishments hardly matter in this pocket where power and money hold sway.
 
 “Power and money reign supreme in the Port area. These two factors determine the politics here,” said a former policer officer who served in the area for a decade. 
 
 “The situation in Port area is peaceful and we will ensure it remains so,” Raza told TOI. When asked about his role in arresting Munna in 2013, he refused to comment. Munna, too, did not seem to be nervous. “As a law-abiding citizen, I will cooperate with the police,” said Munna.
