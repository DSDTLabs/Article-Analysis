PATNA: A controversy has erupted on Sunday after a rally led by state health minister   passed through the area which is banned for any such activity. 

 Tej Pratap, riding a chariot, led his Dharmnirpeksh Seva Sangh (DSS) rally from   near Gandhi Maidan to   ground on Birchand Patel Path while passing through JP roundabout on   and Dak Bungalow crossing. His supporters sitting inside and on a large number of SUVs with flags of   and   crippled traffic at several places during the rally, which was also escorted by police personnel on Sunday afternoon. The district and police administration don’t allow any such rally beyond the JP roundabout near Gandhi Maidan after the Patna high court order in this regard. Earlier, police used water cannon and force whenever the organizers of any rally attempted to cross the JP roundabout.
 
 SSP Manu Maharaaj said the district administration had not officially informed him about the rally. When asked, Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said, “I will have to look into the issue as how the rally was allowed beyond the JP roundabout. Let me talk to Sadar SDO and other officials.” The DM also said he had no knowledge if any permission for taking out the rally was granted or not.
 
 Former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said the state government had stopped any political procession to cross JP roundabout after the court order. “Pick and choose policy of the government was displayed by allowing Tej Pratap’s political procession, which violated the orders,” he said.
 
 However, RJD spokespersons Chittaranjan Gagan said, “We don’t think there was any violation of rules.”
