VADODARA: Shabbir Patel, a visa consultant, and his aide Hemalsinh  , who had kidnapped MSUâ€™s BCom student  , earlier this month were denied bail by a sessions court here on Wednesday.

 Patel had kidnapped Brahmbhatt, who used to work for him part-time by getting visa applicants, at a low-budget hotel in Fatehgunj and had demanded Rs 12 lakh from his father, a truck driver in Mehsana. Police investigations had revealed that Patel was approached by some of the applicants to get visa on urgent basis. Brahmbhatt told Patel that he knew one Rajendrasinh   of   who can get visa in short time.
 
 In order to get the visa, Patel sent Rs 12 lakh through courier to Chavda but the latter instead sent fake visa to Patel. Chavda then fled to Bangkok keeping Patel in a fix. Patel then pressurized Brahmbhatt to return his money and later kidnapped him on January 10. Brahmbhatt was kept in confinement at Sweet Dreams Hotel in Fatehgunj for eight days and his father Vijaykumar was asked to shelve Rs 12 lakh.
 
 Vijaykumar had approached the detection of crime branch on January 18. On getting the complaint, the cops raided the hotel, freed Brahmbhatt and arrested Patel and Vasiya from there.
 
 After their police custody ended, Patel and Vasiya had applied for bail from the court. During the hearing of their application, the court of additional sessions judge H N   considered the arguments of public prosecutor that Patel and Vasiya are the main accused in the case and that there are possibilities that they will flee to save themselves from the punishment an important factor to deny them bail.
