Nagpur: Many unresolved questions along with myths revolving around Vishnu’s avataar Parshuram and his life were discussed in a programme titled ‘Shapadpi. sharadapi. ek sawad, Bhrugunandan’ organized by Vijay Prakashan at Madhuram Hall of Mor   Bhavan, Sitabuldi on Thursday.

 Noted speaker Sachidanand Shewade and Ashutosh Adoni came together during the discussion of Bharti Sudame’s novel ‘Bhrugunandan’. 
 
 “Sahitya (literature) is something you create with the motive of educating and providing a better thought process for the society at large. Today, people lack the thirst for knowledge but it tests the patience you have inside you,” said Shewade while initiating the discussion. 
 
 Elaborating on the concept of the word ‘Atithi’, Shewade explained how you cannot predict their actual time of coming or going. Several other terms of literature such as ‘sahitya and nahitya’ were explained by him. 
 
 Speaking on different personalities, Ashutosh Adoni said, “As human beings, it is our habit, we love to divide great personalities on the basic of their caste and then we debate on their value.”
 
 “There is a myth that Parshuram killed his mother while obeying his father. If you observe the events closely you will find that in mythology many facts were neglected. Earth is mother of every living things and the mountains have been referred to as the earth’s head. They say while obeying his father’s orders, Parshuram cut the mountain in half and when his father asked him to seek a reward for his deed, he wished to make the mountain whole and green again.
 
 Author Bharti Sudame also answered questions of guests on Parshuram’s life. She also discussed the reason for choosing this topic and the role of her book in today’s life.
