Recently, it was announced that Bollywood actress   (of Masaan and Haraamkhor fame) would be making her Tamil debut in a yet-to-be-titled film directed by Saravanan. The film will be a romantic drama, which stars newbie   and   in the lead. The director says getting the cast together was a one-of-a-kind-experience. 

 He says, “I had earlier worked with Balu Mahendra, Kamal Haasan sir and lastly with   sir on Joker. After that, I decided to direct a film. This intense romance drama is written by Raju Murugan sir himself. Once everything was finalised, I felt that Shweta would be apt for the role. I have seen some of her films and loved her performance. When I reached out to her manager, Shweta had requested for a synopsis of the film. Later, I went to Mumbai for a narration. She was eventually happy about the script, her role and agreed to come on board.” So, what about the hero? “That was a different story altogether. He runs a big catering firm and I happened to met him at a wedding in Coimbatore. I felt he was just right for the role and asked if he was OK to act. We later did an audition and conducted a workshop for him,” shares the director. 
 
 The team will be shooting in   and in some parts of Maharashtra. “Both of them come from different backgrounds. The story revolves around how they meet and the incidents that occur. We will begin from November 27,” he says.
