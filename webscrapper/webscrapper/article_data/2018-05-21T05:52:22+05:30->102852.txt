AHMEDABAD: The state police’s CID (crime) investigating the Bitcoin case says it has found ample evidence against  , who had submitted a complaint of abduction and extortion. Sources aware of developments claim that there is evidence that   himself was involved in committing the crimes that he complained about. 

 According to sources, a CID team has brought in  , a businessman from Surat, who knows about the case involving a Surat-based crypto-currency firm. It is alleged that Bhatt, a Surat-based realtor, had illegally confined   and  , when he incurred losses in Bitcoins, and extorted crypto-currency. Bhatt has refuted these claims. Sources said that   has been questioned more than once in connection with the case by CID sleuths. If sources are to be believed, CID will register an FIR in its Surat office soon. The step will broaden scope of the current case, they said.
 
 “So far, the case was only about the extortion of 200 Bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore,” said an official. “But if a new case is registered, the scope will expand to 1,850 Bitcoins and cover more persons. If the investigation is extended from that stage, the investigators can check the transactions related to converting black money into crypto-currency after demonetization.”
