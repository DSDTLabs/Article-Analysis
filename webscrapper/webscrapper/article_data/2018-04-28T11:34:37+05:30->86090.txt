NEW DELHI: Higher sales and demand for fat-margin models saw   report a 10% growth in net profit in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 at Rs 1,882.1 crore against Rs 1,710 crore in the same period of 2016-17.

 
 The growth in net came in even as the company’s tax expenses went up.
 
 Net sales during the reported quarter rose to Rs 20,594 crore, up 14% against the year-ago period.
 
 Sales volume in the fourth quarter surged 11% to 4,61,773 as demand swelled for models such as Vitara mini SUV, Baleno and Swift hatchbacks.
 
 For the full year ended March 31, the company posted its highest-ever annual net at Rs 7,722 crore, up 5% from Rs 7,350 crore in the previous year. Net sales in 2017-18 stood at Rs 78,104 crore, up 17% from 2016-17.
 
 Commenting on the rise in net profit during the year,   chairman R S Bhargava said, “Compared to last year, the effective tax rates went up by about 3%. Instead of 26% earlier, it has gone up to 29%.”
 
 Other items that put pressure on Maruti’s balance sheet included an outgo of around Rs 255 crore for resolving a land issue in Manesar, Bhargava said.
 
 The company also faced cost pressure, including rise in commodity prices, forcing the company to shell out Rs 700 crore extra during 2017-18 on various items, including steel and aluminium.
 
  
  
 
 “Despite all this, we have done better during the year in all aspects. Our market share has gone up by 2.7% to 50% in the passenger vehicles segment,” Bhargava said. The company’s board also gave its in-principle approval for establishing an employee welfare fund, and a trust to promote scientific research and technology in India.
 
 Bhargava said a new royalty payment formula has been approved, which would result in lower royalty payment outgo for the company. Under the new formula, royalty would be calculated in rupee terms and there would be a discount on the royalty after a certain volume, and the expenses done by Maruti in product development would also be reimbursed.
 
 “It has been applied to three new models — Ignis, Swift and Dzire. These models will now be subject to new formula. The expectation is that by 2021, all Maruti models would come under this formula, resulting in royalty percentage figure coming down from the current 5.4%,” Bhargava said. He added that the figure is expected to go down under 5% (of net sales) going ahead.
