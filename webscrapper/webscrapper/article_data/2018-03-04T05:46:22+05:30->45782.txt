The CPM’s sense of its own invincibility is more likely to prevail, with the party’s apologists already busy pointing out that the demographics and political fault lines in Kerala are very different from that of Tripura. The humiliating Tripura defeat is, however, bound to make the CPM more amenable to a

 
 softer approach towards   at the national level, with veteran V S   publicly voicing the sentiment no soon had the election result been confirmed by Saturday noon.
