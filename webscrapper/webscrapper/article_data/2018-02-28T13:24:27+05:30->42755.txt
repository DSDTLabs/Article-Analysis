Visakhapatnam: Five Indian firms have submitted bids for the Request for Qualification (RfQ), the first stage of bidding process invited by the Amaravati Metro   Corporation Ltd ( ) for the 43km-long Vizag   Rail (VMR) project. 

 The five firms are: Gurgaon-based Adani Enterprises Limited, Mumbai-based TRIL Urban Transport Private Limited, Mumbai-based Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited, Noida-based ESSEL Infraprojects Limited, and Mumbai-based IL&FS Rail Limited.
 
 The AMRC, under the aegis of the state government, will scrutinise the bids and shortlist the eligible firms for further notification of Request for Proposal (RfP), which will be the final invitation to eligible private players for the Rs 8,800 crore project.
 
 Speaking to TOI, AMRC managing director N P   said all the five firms submitted bids with a volume of documents, ranging between 1,500 to 2,000 pages, explaining their experience in taking up big public-private-partnership (PPP) mode projects like airports, metro rail projects, elevated corridors etc.
 
 “We will take at least a month to thoroughly study their bid documents before shortlisting the eligible firms for further notification of RfP. We hope all these five would be shortlisted for the RfP, which will be invited in April this year,” Reddy said. The receipt of RfP proposals from the firms and the selection of a suitable developer is proposed to be completed in another five months, he added.
 
 Reddy said the shortlisted firms will then apply for the RfP in collaboration with their partner companies. He further clarified that the firms need not have experience in taking up metro rail projects for submitting bids in the RfQ or RfP, but they must have hands-on experience in taking up any giant project on the PPP model.
 
 “Participation of such big companies in the RfQ stage is a clear indication that PPP is a viable model. We are confident the   is going to be a successful project under this model,” Reddy added.
