CHANDIGARH: Despite the sluggish trend in IT sector, Infosys could expedite setting up of its Mohali campus. At a meeting with Nandan Nilekani,  , in Bengaluru on Friday,   local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu raised the issue and the former assured that despite the unfavourable trend, he would talk to the Infosys CEO to expedite the project.

 Sidhu discussed introduction of e-governance across the 167 urban local bodies in the state. Among other things, a public grievances app would also be rolled out pertaining to these services enabling the people to lodge their complaints in case they encounter any problem.
 
 Sidhu said the Congress government promised ‘Captain’s Government at your doorstep’ with focus on e-governance to ensure transparency, simplifying service delivery, and driving efficiency. The representatives of Punjab stated that their vision would not be merely technology enablement but the start to process re-engineering.
 
 An MoU was signed in February with eGovernments Foundation, also co-founded by Nandan Nilekani, to provide solutions for e-governance of urban local bodies (ULBs) throughout Punjab. An official said that the initial focus was on improved street lighting, controlling mosquito menace, managing stray dog menace, improved waste management and reducing potholes.
 
 Over 500 IT experts would be hired through TCS for the capacity building of ULBs. Sidhu said 10 experts each would be deployed with each of the municipal corporations, while five experts each would be assigned to each medium-level municipal councils and two each for each smaller municipal councils/nagar panchayats.
