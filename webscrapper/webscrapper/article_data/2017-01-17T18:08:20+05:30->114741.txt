Singer  , who completes 50 years in the film industry this year, paid his respects to his senior in the industry, KJ   by performing a paadha puja. Talking at the low-key event, an emotional   said that he wanted to pay his guru dakshina to Yesudas, who he referred to as 'my guru, brother and father figure'. 'My thirst is quenched. God has been kind with all of us. Maybe, he has been kinder with me because I stand behind him in talent or voice, but still I could sit along with him, and he has come to bless me on this occasion' We all pray that he should live long and he should keep singing and bless the entire world with his gandharva gaanam,' said the singer, who has also embarked on a world tour to mark his 50th year.

 Yesudas, who revealed that he had broken his own rule of not attending any events on a day he had a concert only for 'my Balu', mentioned that they were one and the same. 'We are ekam, not dwaitam. We came through music, and she is the blessed mother for us. He always mentions that he hasn't learnt music, but he shouldn't say that. He has learnt through various births and has reached a very high position now. Everybody knows that he is a great singer, and that is because of the blessings of Goddess  ,' he praised.
 
 Interestingly, Yesudas revealed that the day was also his star birthday, and marvelled at the coincidence of SPB paying his respects on the same day.
 
 He also narrated an incident that happened in Paris where they had gone for a concert. 'After the concert, we found out that there was no food at the hotel. I thought, 'What's going to happen if I miss one meal; after all, I've lived without food for three days in my early days,' and retired to my room. Later, I heard a voice calling out 'Room service' outside my door. I opened the door, and Balu was standing there with rice and rasam for me. I will never forget that meal, and I do not think any meal can give me that satisfaction. That is the care he has for me,' he recalled.
