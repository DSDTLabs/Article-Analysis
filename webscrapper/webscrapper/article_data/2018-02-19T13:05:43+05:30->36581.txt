Filmmaker   has debunked rumours he's next in line to direct  . "I won't be the man (to direct the next Bond). No, categorically," Nolan told.

  
  
 But he would love to helm a Bond film. "I think every time they hire a new director I'm rumoured to be doing it. I'd love to make a Bond film at some point and I think those producers -   and Michael (  and G Wilson) - they do a tremendous job and   has done a terrific job the last couple of films, so they don't particularly need me."
 
 "But I've always been inspired by the films and would love to do one someday," he said.
