You just enjoyed a nice lunch and are now struggling to stay awake, sitting sluggishly on your work desk. You are not alone! A lot of people feel sleepy after having a meal. But why do people feel this  ? Here we decode it for you.

 How can you avoid this slump? Overeating, taking big portions and feasting on fatty meals make your body suffer.

 However, if you are constantly feeling tired and sluggish, it’s advisable to visit a doctor.
