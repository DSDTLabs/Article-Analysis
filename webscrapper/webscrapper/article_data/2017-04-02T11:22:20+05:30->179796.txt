 According to the information from the Bilara tehsil office, there were orders to widen the road from tehsil office given to the sarpanch and patwari. They were also directed to remove the encroachments and widen the road adjacent to the agricultural field belonging to Lalitaâ€™s family.

 On the other hand, the Brahmin community is unifying to seek justice for the victim, who belonged to the Brahmin community. They are demanding a judicial probe now accusing the police to hush up the case and saving the accused.
 
 Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot also visited the family on Friday and consoled them accusing the present government of absolute apathy and spurt in the crime, especially against the women.
 
 Meanwhile, the police have not yet been successful to get to the accused of the case, who have still been absconding and mustering support for them through other sarpanchs, who submitted memorandum to the district administration in favour of the accused sarpanch Ranveer Singh Champawat.
