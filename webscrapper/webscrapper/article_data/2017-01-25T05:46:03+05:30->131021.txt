NAGPUR: A mother-son duo of   duped more than a dozen job aspirants, including the 29-year-old complainant and his relatives, to the tune of around Rs40 lakh. Dhantoli police have registered offence of fraud against the mother, identified as  , and her son Harshal, who had taken Rs2 lakh from each of their victims while promising them a job. The complaint was filed by   (29).

 The absconding tricksters had been residing in the jurisdiction of  . “Madhuri and Harshal had been behind bars for a month in similar cases two years back,” said senior PI RA Mane. The duo had taken substantial amount from Satpaise and others in February 2016, but the complainant approached cops quite late as they were trying to get back the money on their own, added the PI.
 
 “The mother-son were recently booked by Lakadganj police for cheating electronic shopkeepers. They used to buy air conditioners with cheque payments, which later bounced,” said Mane. Apart from Dhantoli and Lakadganj police stations, offences of fraud had also been registered against them at Sitabuldi and Ambazari police stations, he said.
 
 Satpaise had been given ‘confirmation’ of a job at Western Coalfield Limited (WCL) for the post of clerk by the tricksters. So he recommended his other unemployed relatives and friends to approach Madhuri, who had said she worked in Airport Authority of India. Harshal used to collect money from the victims at several different places, said cops. The matter came to fore when Satpaise went to WCL office with his appointment letter and was told that it was fake.
 
 Satpaise and others then started demanding their money back. Harshal returned some amount to the victims. Cops have now launched a manhunt to catch the mother-son due on the basis of their previous records.
