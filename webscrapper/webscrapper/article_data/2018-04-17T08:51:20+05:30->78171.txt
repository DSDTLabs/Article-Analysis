GANDHINAGAR: All India   president   is likely to visit   in mid-June to address the newly inducted members of the party. The state unit has launched a two-month long membership drive. Rahul Gandhi had visited Gujarat in January this year. 

 State Congress president Amit Chavda, leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani and   in-charge Rajeev Satav have been visiting talukas and districts to appoint minimum two new workers - one man and one woman - on every booth.
 
 A senior Congress leader said that Rahul Gandhi is personally monitoring progress in recruitment of new members. "The two-month drive will end in June second or third week, thereafter the party will organize a gathering of all the newly recruited members which Rahulji is expected to attend. The party is giving a major thrust on revival of its base in urban areas."
