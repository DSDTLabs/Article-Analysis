Actor   is quiet content these days, for all the work that he has put in for director Harikumar’s upcoming film  .
 The movie is a biopic of prodigy Edmund Thomas Clint, who left behind about 25,000 paintings before a kidney ailment claimed his life when he was just seven years old. 
 
  Playing Clint’s dad MT Joseph – at ages 35 and 70 – has been a moving experience for the actor, as he says, “It’s the first time I am playing a real-life character, and to be honest this role has haunted me the most. Joseph is an optimist who always looks at the bigger picture. When Clint had said he didn’t want to go to school, Joseph agreed and encouraged him to pursue art and enjoy the world of colours. He gave priority to his son’s wish than stick to conventions.”
 
 His physical transformation to play the septuagenarian also helped Unni get into the mindset of the character. “I stuck to a strict sugar-free diet that sort of made my body weak. Apart from looking tired, I was mentally exhausted and that helped me transform into Joseph. I lived as the character for weeks and was deeply affected,” Unni says.
 
 The shoot of the film also brought to the fore his “parental instinct” as the actor says he grew close to the child artiste Alok, who plays Clint.
 “I was able to feel exactly what Joseph had gone through while losing his son. There is a scene, where Alok’s head is being shaved and the pain I felt was unbearable,” he says.
 
 During the course of the film, Unni says his respect for Joseph and his resilience grew manifold. “Physically, we don’t have much likeness, but we are both hooked to body building and wrestling. Getting to know him has also given me a different perspective about life,” says the actor.
 
 Unni though confesses that Joseph was not a big fan of his 70-year-old. “I remember uncle telling me that he is not as old or feeble as I make him out to be in the film,” he laughs.
