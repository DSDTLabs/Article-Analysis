NEW DELHI: Mehul   of   has virtually declared he has downed shutters. The diamaond trader, who along with his nephew   is wanted in the Rs 11,300 crore PNB scam, has told his employees to look for jobs elsewhere as he was in no position to clear his dues. 

  In a letter, Choksi has said his operations have come to a standstill because "investigating agencies have started to create a havoc", and has claimed he was feeling "insecure about the safety of himself and his family members" because of the investigation and his bank accounts being frozen. 
 
  Choksi said he was writing with a "heavy heart", asserting, "I am committed to clear your past dues... once things return to normalcy." He also said employees could keep the laptops/mobiles issued from his group firms. 
 
  "...with the recent false allegations levelled against me of defrauding PNB bank and the media frenzy, the situation... is turning graver by the day," he wrote.
 
 "I will face my destiny and I know I have done nothing wrong, and ultimately, the truth shall prevail. At this moment, agencies seem to be interested not in fair probe but in creating a fear psychosis within my employees. The kind of unfair treatment, unfair investigation, media frenzy and political statements are making me highly insecure about the safety of myself and my family members," he adds.
