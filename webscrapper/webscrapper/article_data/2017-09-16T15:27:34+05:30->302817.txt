 In an interview during the promotion of 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle', the director revealed his plan for another 'Kingsman' film and also let it slip that he has had "chat" about the Kryptonian superhero.
 
 "I am planning another Kingman, I've written the treatment and some of the scenes...I don't know what I'm going to do next but I have had chats about Superman, I love Superman," Vaughn said. 
 
 "If somebody asks me to do Indiana Jones, most of the superheros or Star Wars the fanboy in me can't help but be excited."

 The DC movie is expected to mark the director's return to superhero films. He successfully directed 'X-Men: First Class' in 2011 and helmed another comic book adaptation 'Kick-Ass' in 2010.
