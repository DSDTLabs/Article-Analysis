For two days, the forest department failed to tranquillise and trap the leopard localised in an open ground, encircled with nets.

 Spotted in   village on Thursday, the leopard was shot at by the police on Saturday morning. Though it died on the spot, it is not clear what killed it. In fact, the
 
 
 forest department said it does not know who shot at the big cat.
 
 “We recovered the animal dead from the kitchen of the house in Aurangabad Khalsa,” said chief conservator ( ) K Pravin Rao.
 
 The postmortem was on till late Saturday evening to find the cause of the leopard’s death.   (Awadh)   said the postmortem report might be out on Sunday.
 
 The department has constituted an inquiry to find out who killed the big cat. The report will be out in 15 days.
 
 “It is our failure that we could not sensitize police and locals,” said UP chief wildlife warden ( ) SK Upadhyay. The forest department has also lodged a case against unidentified people under the Wildlife Protection Act.
 
 CWW said, “We have filed a departmental case against the violation and it is equivalent to FIR.”
 
 The department said its officers were not present at the spot where the big cat was shot at since a mob had made it difficult for them to act, causing a law and order situation.
 
 On the theory of the police shooting the leopard in self-defence, he said, “Where does the question of selfdefence arise when it was locked inside a kitchen.”
