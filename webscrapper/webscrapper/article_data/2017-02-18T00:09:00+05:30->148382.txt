Alwar: At least a dozen armed assailants attacked and killed an elderly couple at their residence at Naryan Pur village in Alwar district during early hours on Thursday.

 The two were into giving loans on jewellery to villagers. After murdering the couple, the assailants decamped with cash and valuables. Till evening, the police have detained 10 persons who had earlier lived as tenants in the house that belonged to the elderly couple.
 
 Thousands of villagers gathered at the spot of the heinous   after it became known to the public. Their bodies were lying in a pool of blood as the assailants had slit their throats.
 
 “The couple, identified as Ganesh Agarwal (80) and Bimla (75), lived alone in the house. Their family members, including a son and daughter-in-law, live in Delhi and Bhopal, respectively. Everything in the house was found scattered, clearly indicating that it was a murder-cum-robbery committed for gain,” said Rahul Prakash, superintendent of police, Alwar, to TOI on Thursday.
 
 Senior police officers along with a dog squad, FSL team and others rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. “It is too early to say who were behind this murder. It could be an organised gang or some people acquainted with the couple,” said a senior police officer.
 
 The deceased man used to give loans on jewellery and it appears that some people, who were aware of this business, could be behind the murder, the police said.
 
 “The exact assessment of money robbed can be done only after other family members arrive. We are also going through transaction slips and diaries that we found at the spot,” the officer added.
 
 Police further stated that a portion of the house was given on rent by the elderly couple. “There were 15 tenants in the house and some of them are missing,” said an officer.
