A22-year-old Thai Sikh, Manjeet  , was conferred with the award for exceptional academic pursuits by the King of Thailand, making him a role model of sorts for the expatriate community.

 Born in Khonkaen, about 450 km from Bangkok in Northeast Thailand, Manjeet, who is also known as Jolly, now aspires to promote Sikhism and Sikhs' distinct identity in Thailand.
 
 While talking to TOI, Jolly, the youngest of three siblings, said he had completed his bachelors in logistic engineering from   in Bangkok. “I had topped the logistics engineering studies and I was lucky to meet the King of Thailand Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarngkun and to receive a   medal from him.”
 
 Son of a realtor in Khonkaen, Jolly’s two brothers work as project managers in a real estate development company in Pattaya city, near Bangkok.
 
 After graduating, Jolly joined the supply chain department of one of Thailand’s biggest wood particle board manufacturing company. He said logistics engineering was very much in demand in Thailand and he was a proud to pursue this career.
 
 Jolly won a scholarship every year during his fouryear graduation course and remained president of  , chief organizer of   and president of the students' committee.
 
 Fumbling for words to describe the momentous occasion of receiving a gold medal from the King of Thailand, Jolly said, “I felt very proud when I went to receive the award sporting a turban and beard. It is a rare opportunity to meet the king."
 
 He said he wanted to make the people of Thailand aware about Sikhism, Sikhs' distinct identity and significance of the turban and beard in a Sikh’s life. “I usually take my Thai friends to the gurdwara. Now, I plan to start a ‘Singh in Style’ Facebook page with the help of my brother to popularize the turban, especially among teenagers,” he added.
