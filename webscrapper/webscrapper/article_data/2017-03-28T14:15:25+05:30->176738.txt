 Kapoor, who’s wowed everyone with her singing prowess and fashionable appearances, strutted down the ramp for designer   at   Showcase Week 2017 on Monday evening. The ‘Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan’ singer was the showstopper for her close friend, whose creations she has been wearing for 17 years now.
 
 The two shared great camaraderie as they posed backstage for the shutterbugs. Kanika owned the ramp with her grace and style in a gorgeous black creation designed by Nandita. Here are the pictures of the two and a video of Kanika sashaying down the ramp.
