NEW DELHI: Claiming that PNB scam accused   and   were personally known to the Prime Minister,   said   had promised to bring back black money from abroad but had only succeeded in sending white money out of India. As the opposition blockaded Parliament over "bank scam" on Monday, Congress leaders   and Anand Sharma told reporters that government was trying to avoid a debate on the issue because culpability pointed in the direction of the government. They demanded that the PM make a statement on the issue.

 
 The Congress leaders said PM Modi knew Nirav Modi and Choksi, arguing that Nirav's picture with him in Davos after he had escaped from India could not be an accident. "It is called a frame photo of which advance screening and vetting has to be done by intelligence agencies, by the Indian embassy and by the PMO. I can tell you by my experience of five years â€” even with a cabinet minister, no such frame photo can be taken, including the seating arrangement and standing arrangement, and where the person will stand," Sharma said.
 
 Congress also targeted Vinod Rai, former CAG who gave the report with the notional loss in 2G spectrum sales during UPA regime, and became the   Chairman under the Modi government.
 
 "Why is the Banking Board Chairman quiet? This is not notional loss.This is real loss and real loot. But he continues to be the favourite of the government," Sharma said.
 
 Azad said every time the Prime Minister goes on trips abroad, BJP claims that he has become very popular globally. "But what does the country gain from his popularity? India would gain if he uses his friendship with other countries to get these four five persons, who have cheated our banks, arrested," he argued.
