VARANASI: While   leaders are claiming to hold the joint roadshow of their vice president   and   president and chief minister   in the city on Saturday, the SP camp has doubts over participation of Akhilesh in this event due to his engagements in five rallies in   on the same day. 

 According to ADM (protocol) Vidya Shankar Singh, except the information about the arrival of special protection group (SPG) team no itinerary of Rahul or Akhilesh had been received till Thursday evening. On the other hand, the district Congress committee president Prajanath Sharma claimed that he had the final itinerary of Rahul's visit. He, along with the party's national secretary, discussed the route map of the proposed roadshow with SPG team, administration and police till late in evening. Sharma said that Rahul and Akhilesh will reach the city together at 10.15 am on Saturday.
 
 Sharma further added that the roadshow will commence after offering garlands to the statue of BR Ambedkar at Kutchehri crossing by both the leaders. The route map being finalized by the party hinted that the roadshow will cover only the localities falling under City North and City South seats, where candidates of SP-Congress alliance are contesting on Congress symbol. 
 
 However, the SP's state spokesman Manoj Rai Dhoopchandi and city unit chief Rajkumar Jaiswal denied having any intimation from party high command regarding the arrival of Akhilesh to participate in the roadshow with Rahul. Rai said that information available with party office bearers so far contains that five electoral rallies of Akhilesh are already scheduled in west UP district on Saturday. They said that had the Varanasi visit of Akhilesh finalized by the party high command the local unit would have been alerted to make necessary preparations. 
 
 UPCC spokesman Satish Rai claimed that after the roadshow Rahul and Akhilesh will release common minimum programme of the alliance.
