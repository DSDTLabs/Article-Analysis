PUNE: Coming in to bowl in the 28th over,   started his spell with a no-ball, but the pacer compensated for that extra run conceded by giving India their first wicket (David Warner) off his second ball.

 Should India have brought on Umesh early? India's batting coach   said holding the pacer back was part of their plan. “Umesh is known to bowl well with the old ball. Even in the series against England, you could see he got a lot of reverse swing.We had held him back, expecting that the ball would reverse-swing pretty early in the innings. It was the plan to hold him back and use Ashwin with Ishant,“ Bangar said.
 
 “We know that Ishant has troubled a number of left-handers from the Australian team over the years. We wanted to exploit this and give him the first go against left-handers. We know the capabilities of Umesh, who can pitch the ball slightly fuller and with reverse swing coming very early into the game, we were expecting that to happen.“
 
 Bangar was all praise for Umesh and said his success is a result of the work that the pacer has put in to improve his craft. “He has improved his balance at the crease, his stride has got a bit shorter, and also his wrist position has gotten better. He has worked very hard on his bowling and the results are for everybody to see. In the last couple of Test series on the Indian wickets, he has shown that he can contribute. It's not just about (number of) wickets , but also of getting the crucial breakthroughs. Both with the new ball and the old ball,“ added Bangar.
