TOKYO: Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s government came under fire on Tuesday after a senior MP suggested only women should raise children under three and another urged newly weds to have at least three kids.

 
 Koichi Hagiuda, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, touched off a firestorm on Sunday when he said men rearing children might be “unwelcome” for them.
 
 “Children need an environment where they can stay with their mothers ... if you ask infants under three which parent they like more, the answer should be mama, even though there are no firm statistics to support it,” the   leader said.
 
 Those remarks came after another MP,  , suggested that young couples should produce at least three children, saying he had received popular backing. Leader of opposition Constitutional Democratic Party lashed out, saying the comments were “intolerable.” “There are many people who cannot give birth despite wanting to and there are many single-father families,” Yukio Edano said.
 
 “What happened to the government’s pledge to build a society where men can participate in child-rearing? I’m sure many fathers have been angered by Hagiuda’s “rude remarks,” Sumire Hamada, a rights’ activist, said.
