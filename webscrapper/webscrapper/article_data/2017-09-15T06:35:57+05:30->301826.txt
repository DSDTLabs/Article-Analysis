BENGALURU: The   on Thursday came to the rescue of individual flat owners, saying the onus of producing occupancy certificates to obtain power connection rests solely on   or developers.Any insistence on individual owners to get such certificates is “per se illegal“, the court added.

 “Individual flat owners, who may be the consumers and applicants, may not have access or right to obtain such occupancy certificate at all from municipal bodies like  . Therefore, insistence upon them to produce occupancy certificate would be per se illegal,“ Justice Vineet Kothari observed, while dismissing a petition filed by BBMP.
 
 The court noted that the   latory Commission ( ) is the sole authority in the matter and guidelines do not require the proof of occupation -in the form of occupation certificate to be issued by municipal bodies, including BBMP -for regulating power supply.
 
 The occupancy certificate of a multi-storey has to be obtained by the builder or developer from the BBMP. The KERC has rightly held that the proof of ownership and occupa tion of premises in question can be proved by any consumer or applicant seeking the power connection in the manner stipulated in the Conditions of Supply (CoS), read with Section 43 of the Electricity Act, 2003. In the absence of any amendment of the relevant by laws or CoS, the state government could not have insisted upon -as has been done in the July 18, 2014 circular to distribution companies -production of occupancy certificate by the consumer applicant in a multi-storey building“ the judge observed.
 
 The BBMP, which was not a party to the proceedings before the KERC, had challenged the April 9, 2015 order issued by the commission on a complaint filed by Vidyuth Grahakara Hitarakshana Vedike and   State Licensed Electrical Contractors' Association.
