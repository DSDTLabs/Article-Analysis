CHENNAI: Monday turned to be a harrowing day for   at Thyagaraya Nagar bus terminus, as MTC services were squeezed in the wake of the strike.

 Nagappan, a commuter, said that he was waiting for 5B route bus (Thayagaraya Nagar - Mylapore) for nearly 45 minutes. "It is the only route that connects Mylapore from here (T Nagar). There is no service for the last 45 minutes," he said.
 
 A woman passenger claimed that the lone MTC service to Kancheepuram from Thyagaraya Nagar was not plying. 
 
 Meanwhile, confusion prevailed among commuters at Koyembedu as private buses, which ferry employees to IT companies and other industries, replaced MTC fleets.
 
 Drivers were charging a flat fare of Rs 50 for a single trip between CMBT and Kelambakkam, which higher than normal charges. "You can alight at any intermediate stopping with Rs 50," the driver of the private bus said.
 
 The white coloured luxury services were operated for Poonammallee and Redhills from CMBT.
