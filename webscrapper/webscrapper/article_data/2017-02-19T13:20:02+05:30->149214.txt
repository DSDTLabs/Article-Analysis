BANKA: Zonal IG Sushil M Khopde has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the cash loot by a gang of armed criminals from the Chandan branch of   (SBI) in Banka district on Friday. Apart from arrest of criminals, the SIT would also probe the security lapses which led to the daring loot.
 
  While   Shashi Shanker Kumar will head the SIT, other members of the team are   (SHO of Chandan police station),   (SHO of Katoria police station),   (SHO of Bounsi police station), Rajnandan Kunwar (SHO of Phullidumar police station) and Amarjeet Kumar (SHO of Amarpur police station).
  
  A group of six criminals had looted around Rs 39 lakh from the bank on Katoria-Deoghar main road. The criminals swiftly took the bank employees into their captivity as soon as the bank opened and forced them to open the locker and cash counter. After looting the cash, the criminals fled on three motorcycles towards the forest area. They also assaulted two bank staff during the looting spree.
  
  According to police sources, initial investigations suggested lapses on the part of bank. “The armed guard of the bank was being used as office peon. His gun was locked in the almirah at the time of loot,” sources said, adding a consignment of new currencies had reached the branch on Thursday.
  
  Banka SP Rajeev Ranjan said police have identified the criminals involved in the cash loot and efforts are on to arrest them. “Lapses on the part of the bank have come to light,” said the SP.
  
  IG Sushil M Khopde said help of Jharkhand police has been sought to crack the case. “The incident site is very near to Jharkhand. Hence, we do not rule out the involvement of inter-state gang in the bank loot,” said the IG.
