PATNA: Newly elected   ( ) president Divyanshu Bharadwaj may have some explaining to do before the university administration on his “fake” graduation degree. PU is likely to serve him a show-cause notice to answer allegations that he has a “false and bogus” degree.

 Representatives of different students’ organizations, including defeated candidate   of Jan Adhikar Chhatra Parishad, have alleged that Divyanshu, admitted to a three-year degree course in B N College, had failed in the first and second year examinations. At the same time, he had allegedly taken admission in a distance learning course of some other university without taking college leaving and migration certificates from PU. A student cannot study at two institutions simultaneously as per the provisions of the University Act.
 
 The PU authorities have asked the principal of B N College to submit certain details related to Divyanshu like his year of examination, transfer and migration certificates. “The head of PU political science department, where the PUSU president is currently enrolled, has also been asked to furnish the same information,” said registrar  .
 
 PU vice-chancellor (VC) Rash Bihari Prasad Singh has already constituted a three-member committee, headed by pro-VC Dolly Sinha, to inquire into the charges levelled against Divyanshu and submit a report at the earliest. “Other members of the committee are geology department head   and statistics department’s S K Singh. Suitable action will be taken against him, if the charges are found correct,” the VC said.
