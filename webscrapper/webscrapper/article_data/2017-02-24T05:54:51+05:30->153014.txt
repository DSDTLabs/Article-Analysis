LUDHIANA: With   (LCBSL) unable to buy a fleet of 200   in the city even after six years since the project started, its management has blamed the   for not paying its share. According to LCBSL, they could not purchase the buses despite the fact that   had already manufactured the buses. 

 The MC officials cited fund crunch behind their failure to pay the share to LCBSL.
 
 When this project was sanctioned for Ludhiana, its total cost was Rs 65.20 crore under Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), but over the years the cost of the project also gone up. The management of the   Service received Rs 32 crore from the central government, Rs 13 crore from the state government but the MC Ludhiana paid only Rs 7.5 crore till date against its share of Rs 28 crore.
 
 Sources revealed that due to scarcity of funds, the department is in a tight position to pay their share therefore they are silent on the purchase of the buses. The management had given the order of purchasing 35 low floor air-conditioned buses and 55 semi low floor non-AC buses from Tata and Ashok Leyland, respectively. Now the situation is such that even bus manufacturing companies have filed a case against the management in high court, which has appointed an arbitrator in this matter.
 
 The MC authorities had promised to pay their share in parts, but this financial year is about to end and still there are no chances of payment.
 
 Mayor Harcharan Singh Gohalwaria promised to purchase more buses, claiming that they had ordered more buses and would get the delivery definitely. About the non-payment of MC share, he said that they would give their share very soon.
 
 He claimed that they would shortly start the service on more routes. However, he admitted that project was not launched as per the demand of this city as more mini buses were required for the industrial town so that buses could move even in heavy traffic areas.
