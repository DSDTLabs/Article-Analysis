PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Those staying near Tilak school in Khadki cantonment are a harried lot.

 They have to put up with foul smell and smoke emanating from the Kailas   in   near Holkar bridge almost throughout the day since the   (KCB), even after 10 years, is yet to install a chimney at the crematorium.
 
 Babulal Yelpur, who stays near Tilak school, said, “The dead bodies here are cremated at any time of the day due to which we face the problem of smoke and foul smell almost throughout the day.” Similar view was shared by another resident, Sangeeta Gosavi.
 
 In July 2007, many students of the school suffered due to the foul smell emanating from the burning of dead bodies. The students were taken to a hospital for treatment and were later discharged. The cantonment then took a decision to not allow cremation during school hours. The cantonment had also approved a resolution to construct a chimney at the crematorium then.
 
 Manish Anand, elected Congress member, said the cantonment had approved a resolution for installing the chimney at the crematorium in his previous term, but nothing has happened since then. 
 
 Ironically, the KCB is now going ahead with a gas-based crematorium. Duryodhan Bhapkar, vice-president, KCB, said the work of constructing a gas-based crematorium will take around two years.
 
 Amol Jagtap, chief executive officer, KCB, said as per new NGT norms, chimneys with a 30-meter height have to be installed at traditional crematoriums to reduce air pollution.
 
 Brig. Dhiraj Mohan, president, KCB, said, “It is feasible to have a common chimney for traditional and new gas-based crematorium since it will reduce the total cost of the project. The cost of the gas-based project is Rs 1.5 crore, out of which chimney would cost Rs 30 lakh. The KCB will wait for approval for the gas-based project till July. If the approval doesn’t come, we will construct the chimney for the traditional crematorium.”
