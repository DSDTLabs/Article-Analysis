HOWRAH: While BJP leaders and workers marched across the state to observe Ram Navami on Wednesday, their counterparts in Howrah were shoved away from outside the 250-year-old Ram temple at Howrah's Ramrajatala, with residents of the area insisting there was no place for politics in their centuries-old puja.

 In no time did the BJP workers gather outside the Ram temple in the morning than they tied saffron triangular flags of a Sangh Parivar outfit, with “Jai Shree Ram“ written on them, on all the lampposts in the area.Like everywhere else, the BJP had ostensibly planned to take out a large procession from Ramrajatala, but the locals would have none of it. On getting wind of the plan, residents got together outside the Ram temple, pus hed away the cadre and tore down the saffron flags. BJP workers beat a hasty retreat.
 
 The residents of the area later explained that every Ram Navami, they gathered at the temple, which had 30feet-high idols of Ram, Sita, Laxman and Vibishan, besides others. “We have been offering prayers to Ram here for ages. Even  's   in 1990 had no political impact on Ramrajatala. Some people wanted to politically capiltalise the celebrations but we did not let them have their way,“ said a resident, Prasanta Ray, echoing the sentiments of locals Alok Das and Baby Sarkar.
 
 Ramrajatala derived its name from the Ram temple and the Ram Navami celebrations date back 250 years when a zamindar, Ayodhya Ram Chowdhury from UP, settled down in the area and built the temple on his land.
 
 Denying the his party's involvement in the attempt at the rally, Howrah district BJP general secretary   said, “The BJP wasn't directly involved at Ramrajatala. Some enthusiastic members of a Sangh outfit put up flags. When locals asked them to leave, they moved 1.5km from the temple to start their procession.“
 
 Local Trinamool MLA Jotu Lahiri said, “We will not allow politics to mar this tradition, we will not allow the place to turn into another Ayodhya.“
