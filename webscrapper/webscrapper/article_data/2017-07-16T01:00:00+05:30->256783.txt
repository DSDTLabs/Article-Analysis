Not just inside the shops, now CCTV cameras are being installed out shops across Agra.

  In order to keep a check on the increasing cases of   and loot in the city,   has collaborated with the residents to put CCTV cameras outside shops and stores located in the busiest areas of the city. A group of   members, who are active social workers, held a meeting with Kunwar Anupam Singh, the superintendent of police, city, Agra Police, and decided to ask shopkeepers and store owners to put cameras voluntarily outside their shops. The control rooms will be set up in police stations and various local shops.
 
  Anurag Gupta, who works in a private bank, says, "For the past few months, the number of robbery cases in the city has gone up, which perturbed locals and the police alike. It is very difficult to catch chain snatchers and vehicle thieves, who take advantage of the busy roads to get away easily. In the meeting with the SP city, we decided to urge the local shopkeepers and store owners to put these cameras. Hearing our proposals the shop owners enthusiastically got ready to be a part of this campaign.'
 
  Anant Upadhyay, a priest in a city temple, says, "We are planning to put 1000 cameras in the city. In the first phase, we have installed around 40-50 CCTV cameras in areas like Ajit Nagar, Hariparwat,   crossing, Wazirpura, among others. The second phase is going to start really soon."
