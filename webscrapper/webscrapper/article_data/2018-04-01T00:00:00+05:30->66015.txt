The   and Kriti Kharbanda-starrer   has been in the making for some time, but director   is nonetheless eagerly awaiting its release, which is slated for April 13. The film, he says, is one of the most special films in his career so far. “That is because I have not touched upon this genre before. My last film, Zoom, was a rom-com, but Dalapathi is a commercial family entertainer, with a love story. So, it’s in a genre of its own,” says Prashant.
So, why the delay? “I got busy with Zoom, Prem with busy Chowka, and Kriti in   and Bollywood. Prem’s look in   was also very different, so Dalapathi was on hold for some time,” says Prashant.
 Prashant and Prem have wanted to work together for a long time, so what sealed the deal with Dalapathi? “We heard just the baseline of the script and we were both on board. Prem told me that this was the first time he agreed to a film after listening to just one line about it. The story is such that if I tell you that line, even you will like it; I can’t reveal it, of course. That’s the best part about the film,” says Prashant, signing off.
