Panaji: Town and country planning minister Vijai  , on Saturday, said he is ready to engage with those opposed to the operationalising of RP 2021.

 Sardesai told reporters that opposition parties had raised the issue of implementation of RP 2021 in the assembly, adding that even some activists had demanded its implementation as the plan has been prepared with due consultation.
 
 Earlier, when RP 2021 was kept in abeyance, the government decided to clear applications for land conversion on a case-to-case basis, Sardesai said, adding that, at the time too, people had raised objections and had demanded that the plan be implemented in its entirety.
 
 “Now we have opened the entire   and for this, too, there is opposition. People say it is a way for corruption,” Sardesai said. While allowing development of settlement areas in RP 2021, Sardesai said he has put a clause stating that no development should be allowed in ecologically sensitive areas. 
 
 The TCP minister said the government was ready to engage with the people over the issue and that the onus of coming up with a solution was now with the people.
 
 “If they don’t have a solution then let people construct anywhere and everywhere. Is it what we are looking for? Is that what Goa should be?” Sardesai said. He also said that on the one hand people are saying orchard land is being sold illegally because RP 2021 is not in force, but, on the other hand, they are opposed to the its implementation.
