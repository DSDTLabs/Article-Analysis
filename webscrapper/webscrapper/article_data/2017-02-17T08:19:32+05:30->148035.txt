CHARMINAR: Excavations at the Naya Quila heritage precinct have unearthed two fountains from the   period as well as terracotta pipes and a hammam.

 The   (ASI) has been conducting the excavation at Bagh-e-Naya Quila in two segments. The recent discoveries are a part of what the archaeology juggernaut believes to be a  , gardens in four blocks, keeping in line with the Persian style of landscaping.
 
 “The recent finds here are the hammam and two fountains. One can see them from the from the Dal Badal Chabutra, a raised platform, which overlooks the entire 30 acres of the Naya Quila which is within the fort walls.The unique feature of the garden is that there is symmetry. There are mirror images of structures and landscapes,“ said N Taher, superintending archaeologist of the Hyderabad circle.
 
 In addition, archaeologists have excavated large water tanks. Sources said that they are 37 metres long and 34 metres wide. An octagonal pavilion has also been unearthed along with the fountains. ASI officials believe that another tank lies hidden underneath the thick vegetation. “We believe that there is a 100 metre long tank buried underneath the vegetation.We can say that it exists based on the evidence available at the site. Clear boundaries are visible,“ an archaeologist working at the site said.
 
 The hammam and chinni khana, or, water cascades have small niches believed to have small lamps which would enhance the aesthetic appeal of the site. Officials said that research on this aspect is in progress.
 
 Officials have now set up a temporary interpretation centre at the site which seeks to explain the nature of the unearthed site and its unique features. The ASI believes that the entrance to the   could have been the Dal Badal Chabutra.
