CHANDIGARH: The   on Friday informed the   and   high court that as many as 315 challans have been issued for non-functional silencers and high volume music players in vehicles from January 1, 2018, till February 15, 2018. 

 The information was provided by the administration in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking stricter implementation of the rule banning modified motorcycles producing a high decibel noise.
 
 Hearing UT's reply, a division bench headed by Justice A K   asked the administration to continue strict action against such violators for using loud music and horns.
 
 Adjourning the case for March 1 for further hearing, the bench further directed the administration to submit a status report on the issue.
 
 In this case, the petitioner, a Chandigarh resident, had submitted before the high court that people are openly flouting traffic norms by getting silencers of their bikes removed and modified to produce a jarring noise, which scares passers-by and creates noise pollution
 
 It was also submitted that the modified bikes also create noise pollution by pressure horns giving a succession of unduly harsh, shrill, loud and alarming noise.
