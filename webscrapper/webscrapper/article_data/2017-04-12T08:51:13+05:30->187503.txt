UDAIPUR: An unknown person copied a photo of an Udaipur-based teenager from her   account and morphed her face on a naked body. 

 Thereafter, the person sent the morphed photo with objectionable comments to the girl, asking her to meet him, else he would make the picture viral. 
 
 The terrified teenager then informed her parents who gave a written complaint at the   station a week ago. However, an FIR is yet to be lodged in the case. 
 
 The police said that the case has been referred to the cyber cell for detailed investigation. 
 
 Meanwhile, the aggrieved family said that instead of taking prompt action, the police officer lectured the girl and her father and advised that he should restrict his daughter from using social media and even a cellphone. The girl's elder sister shared the incident on social media which grabbed the attention of Maneka Gandhi, Union minister for women and child development, who assured to take immediate action in the matter.
 
 The incident took place about six days back. However, the police are clueless as detecting an anonymous message sender on a social media platform is a cumbersome task. 
 
 "We have to depend on the cyber cell for such matters and it takes a long time since the server is not in India but in the US. We can only take any action when the company provides relevant details of the account holder and the IP address etc," said a senior police officer. 
 
 Meanwhile, the circle inspector of   police station said that he didn't mean to lecture the girl and her father but had only lent a piece of advice to stay safe and cautious which has been misunderstood.
