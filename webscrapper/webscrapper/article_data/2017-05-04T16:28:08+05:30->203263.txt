PATNA:   boss   on Wednesday said the   and RSS’s slogan of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is anti-woman as they ignore ‘Mata Sita’.

 Talking to reporters on the occasion of ‘Janki Navami’ (the day of Sita’s birth) at Rajgir in Nalanda district, about 110km south from Patna, Lalu also said he always speaks ‘Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram’ where the name of Goddess Sita comes before Lord Ram.

 Claiming himself as a ‘sachcha Hindu’ (true Hindu), Lalu also said he used to respect the people of all religions and faiths as per the teachings of Hindu religion. “I love people of all faiths, sects and religions and try to help the poor and needy people irrespective of their religious identity,” he said.
 
 Addressing the party workers, the RJD chief said the BJP wanted to divide the nation by spreading hatred, but he would not allow them to do so. He said the RJD and its workers would fight for protecting the Constitution.
