NASHIK: The   policemen would soon be equipped with body cameras as the   department has accepted the tender of the bidder from whom the cameras would be procured. 

 While the police had earlier decided to procure 100 cameras, now the number of these cameras would increase to 125. Commissioner of police Ravinder Kumar   said in all the likelihood, the traffic personnel would start wearing these cameras within the next fortnight.
 
 The body cameras will make the police force technologically advanced and will also ensure transparency in their work. It is expected that after the police start wearing such cameras, motorists would not try to err in the first place and get caught on the camera. Further, instances of erring motorists arguing with the police are also likely to come down.
 
 The body cameras will bring transparency in the working of the traffic police and at the same the police will also have strong evidence in the form of footage captured in the camera of erring motorists.
 
 "Our aim is to make maximum use of technology to bring efficiency and transparency in the working of the police. The body cameras, high-tech towing van, e-challan system, the QRT system are among various things implemented in the past couple of years by the police," Singal said.
