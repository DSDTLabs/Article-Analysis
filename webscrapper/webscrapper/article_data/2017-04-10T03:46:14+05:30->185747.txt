AJMER: Bangladesh Prime Minister   visited Ajmer’s   dargah on Sunday amid high security.

 The PM reportedly offered prayers for the prosperity and harmony of her country, and for strong bilateral ties with India. She also offered a chaadar at the 13th century Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti’s tomb, and spent over 15 minutes inside the crypt.
 
 PM Hasina’s visit was monitored by several platoons of police forces, who had vacated the dargah before she arrived there. Authorities had blocked the road leading to the dargah to enhance security, and had to manage the   procession by Jain community.
 
 On her arrival, PM   was welcomed by the dargah’s management committee dewan Zanial Ali Khan, who presented an honour letter to her.
 
 Khadim Kamruddin Chishti completed the rituals with her, after which she flew out of the city. Hasina is a regular devotee at the   dargah as thousands of Bangladeshis are Chishti’s ardent followers.
