PATNA: The AK-47 magazine, which was looted from   SP Anusuya Ransingh Sahu’s bodyguard on Thursday, is yet to be recovered.

 The incident occurred when district magistrate Harihar Prasad and Sahu tried to pacify a group of   supporters who had blocked an approach to the newly commissioned JP Setu to protest governor Keshri Nath Tripathi’s invitation to Nitish Kumar to take oath as chief minister of the   government.
 
 The agitating RJD activists allegedly attacked the DM with bamboo sticks and pelted stones targeting him and the SP. The agitators also snatched AK-47 magazine from Sanjay Kumar, one of the bodyguards of the SP, during the melee.
 
 Sources said an FIR has been lodged with   police station against unknown RJD supporters for attacking the DM and the SP. “Sonepur block development officer Zubaid Ahmed, circle officer Raj Kumar and SHO of Sonepur police station Ram Kumar Singh were the co-complainants,” said a source. Police said raids were on to arrest the suspects and recover the magazine.
 
 The RJD supporters had blocked roads at four different places in Saran district on Thursday after Nitish Kumar joined NDA by parting ways with Grand Alliance.
