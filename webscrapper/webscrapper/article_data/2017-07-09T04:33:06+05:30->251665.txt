Greater Noida: Most of the 13 block development committee ( ) members and the two dancers who were arrested on Thursday for indulging in obscene acts in a house in   were drunk, officials sources confirmed to TOI.

 After a tip-off from a person living in a house in the neighbourhood in Sector Chi-Phi of the city, the police raided the spot and nabbed the BDC members who were residing in the house for 15-20 days, sources said.
 
 “Prima facie, most of them were drunk and indulging in obscene acts. Hence, they have been booked under IPC Section 294 (obscene acts and songs to the annoyance of public). They were let off the next day as the offence is a bailable one,” sources said.
 
 Even as some people in the neighbourhood said that a local   functionary had helped the BDC members get accommodation in Greater Noida, the police denied the involvement of any person from any political party in the case.
 
 “We are trying to investigate who helped them with the accommodation,” Amit Shrivastava, circle officer, Greater Noida 1, said.
 
 Meanwhile, he police said they would file a chargesheet in the case within a month.
 
 Jitendra Kumar, SHO, Kasna, told TOI that the BDC members had come to the spot some days earlier but it was the first time such a complaint had been lodged against them.
 
 The BDC members, belonging to the Chandauli block, were arrested after a neighbour complained that they were creating nuisance in the area.
 
 After a neighbour dialled 100, the police raided the spot and found the men in an objectionable situation with a group of women while playing loud music and dancing. They were soon arrested from the spot.
