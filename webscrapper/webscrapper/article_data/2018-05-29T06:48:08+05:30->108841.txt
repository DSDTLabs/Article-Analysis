HYDERABAD: Students of the   ( ) sat on a hunger strike in front of the chief warden's office on Monday against relocation of some students from various hostels during summer break. 

 
 Dozens of students raised their voice against the chief warden's move to lock down hostels and relocate students. "Hundreds of students will be affected by this move. Especially students of integrated and masters programme pursue internships and projects during summer break. We will not tolerate closure of hostels and relocation of students for a month since the next academic session is scheduled to commence from July," said P Sreerag, president of the UoH students' union. 
 
 The student leaders argued that the administration's move to relocate students to save electricity and water was not favourable for many. 
 
 "In the process, they are not even sparing the visually-challenged students. In the name of saving electricity and water, they are forcing students to shift to other hostels though the per capita water and electricity consumption will remain the same," argued Arif Ahammed, general secretary of the students' union. 
 
 It may be recalled that the university had accorded permission to about 450 post-graduate students preparing for competitive exams or attending to official internships.
 
 A press communique issued by the university earlier this month states that the move to accommodate students in a "handful of hostels" was "to rationalise use of electricity, water and management of messes". 
 
 "This will also allow the university to take up the much-needed maintenance and repairs of some hostels. The university spends, on an average, about Rs 9.5 crore per annum on electricity, water and internet in hostels. But, the rising costs of maintenance coupled with acute shortage of water supply has compelled the university to charge students wanting to stay back during vacation," the communique read.
