SECUNDERABAD: Move over  . Secunderabad has a new address — KTR-Nirmala Sitharaman Road. Vexed by the apathy of SCB authorities, a group of residents resorted to ‘shramdan’ yet again by filling up the pothole-ridden Allahabad Gate (AOC Gate)- Marredpally stretch on Monday and renamed it KTR-Niramala Sitharaman Road.

 “As the local military authority ( ) is closing the Allahabad Gate at night and making the stretch out of bounds for commuters, we thought the defence minister’s name would be apt to bring the apathy of the officials to her notice. We have put up placards on every pothole,” M Krishank, onbe of the protestors, told TOI. The angry residents chose a 350-metre stretch which had 10-13 deep potholes and craters. “Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears, we had decided to carry out the task of repairing the stretch ourselves,” Shyam Kumar, one of the activists of ‘Save Bison polo ground’ (SBPG) campaign told TOI. This is the second stretch in Secunderabad Cantonment being renamed by the locals in recent times. The stretch beside St John’s Junior College near Sangeeth Junction is already much in news after it was given a new name — KTR-Ivanka Trump Road — two weeks ago.
 
 “We filled up the potholes with mud, gravel and rounded stones within one hour. We spent ₹4,500, which was contributed by the SBPG activists,” Shyam added.
 
 The stretch connects Safilguda, Malkajgiri, Neredmet, Sainikpuri and adjoining areas. “We will repair all the stretches before the onset of monsoon. We will also recarpet important stretches soon,” a senior official said.
