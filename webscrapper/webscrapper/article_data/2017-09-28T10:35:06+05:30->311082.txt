NEW DELHI: The   has called ministries and financial institutions for discussions on Thursday to look at sectors where it can step up capital expenditure and generate more   and jobs at a time when the government is under attack for the weak economic environment.

 The invitation to financial institutions is seen to be crucial given the limited fiscal headroom for the Centre, especially when goods and services tax (GST) collections remain uncertain. 
 
 At the same time, credit demand has been low as companies are not investing partly due to the weak demand in the economy as also their stretched finances. Itâ€™s a different matter that public sector banks themselves are under pressure on account of the massive pile-up in bad debt.
  
 
 
 Sources said that the government was identifying sectors where it can step up investment and the budgetary spending pattern of ministries. The early passage of Budget by Parliament has meant that public expenditure is higher so far in the current financial year and capital spending is nearly 33% higher.
 
 But the overall numbers mask the spending of certain key ministries, which had been identified for higher public spending. Water resources (13%) and railways (18%), for instance, have not even spent a fifth of their annual allocations during the first four months. Power (21%) too is near that mark, while roads, rural development and communications had consumed up to 45% of their annual allocation between April and July.
 
 While several economists, such as former NITI Aayog vice-chairman  , have been split on breaching the fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of GDP, there is also a view that given the weak private investment climate it may make sense to ignore the cap, especially as the   government is less than two years away from election.
 
 Modi had made job creation a key election issue in the run-up to the 2014 elections and his critics have slammed the employment record during the first three years.
