MUMBAI: Four art installations made with   collected from   are drawing people’s attention in Global Hospital’s lobby in Parel. The ‘heart’, ‘liver’, ‘eyeball’ and ‘kidneys’ are a part of NGO Mohan Foundation’s novel campaign to increase awareness about organ donation.

 “Our campaign ‘Life before Ashes’ is a hard-hitting message to donate organs instead of burning them. We want people to realise that what has now become ashes, could have been another person’s heart or kidney, if only the organs were donated,” said Jaya Jairam of Mohan Foundation.
 
 The installations will move to other hospitals, malls and public places across Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai over the next one month. Organ donations are the only hope for patients suffering from end-stage organ failure.
 
 A Union health ministry study had estimated that the annual requirement for kidneys could range between 1-2 lakh with a mere 5,000 transplants occurring across the country.   donations could reduce this waiting list, but Indian cities witness poor donations. Mumbai has improved its donations to 59 cadaveric donors in 2017, but there is a long way to go.
