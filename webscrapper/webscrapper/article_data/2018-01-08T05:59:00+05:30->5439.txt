 Chennai: A meeting of the DMK district secretaries held here on Sunday has asked Tamil Nadu chief minister, Edappadi K Palaniswami to personally intervene and bring to an end the on-going transport workers’ strike in the state. The meeting, held at the party headquarters Anna Arivalayam, also wanted the district review meetings being conducted by state governor Banwarilal Purohit to be stopped immediately.
 
 The DMK district secretaries meeting which was the first to be held after the party’s R K Nagar drubbing, passed 11 resolutions. The meeting, chaired by DMK working president M K Stalin and held on the eve of the Tamil Nadu assembly session being convened on Monday, decided to hold the party’s Zonal conference in Erode on March 24-25.
 
 One resolution congratulated party president M Karunanidhi’s daughter and Rajya Sabha MP, Kanimozhi and former Union telecom minister A Raja for “coming out clean” in the 2G spectrum case. A special CBI court had on December 18 acquitted all the 11 accused in the case.
 
 Another resolution passed at the meet wanted the Centre to allay fears of Muslims over the Triple Talaq Bill, which has already been passed by the Lok Sabha and awaiting a passage in the Rajya Sabha, where the NDA government lacks numbers. Almost all opposition parties, including the AIADMK and the DMK in Tamil Nadu, are pressing for the bill to be sent to a Standing Committee for review.
 
 The DMK district secretaries meeting also resolved to urge the Centre to immediately release the full quantum of relief sought by Tamil Nadu to undertake relief work in the areas affected by the recent Ockhi Cyclone. Another resolution passed at the meeting expressed concern over the increasing debt burden of the Tamil Nadu government and wanted an expert committee to be formed to study the state’s precarious financial situation.
