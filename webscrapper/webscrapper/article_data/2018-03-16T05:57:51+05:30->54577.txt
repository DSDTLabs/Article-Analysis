KOLKATA: The dream of a new life for two sisters came crashing down when a raging fire on   engulfed everything they had. Jyotsna and  , who had been preparing for a “haldi ceremony” just hours ago, sat speechless inside a charred structure that used to be their home. The sisters were due to get married on Sunday.

 The sisters had to drop studies after Class V due to their father’s death. They grew up amid the filth and dirt dumped by the side of circular railway tracks. Their mother —   Bibi, a ragpicker — struggled to make ends meet, but never allowed her daughters to work.
 
 Kalpana said, “Mother had managed to buy some ornaments for our marriage. She worked really hard to save up some money for our marriage. She also took loan from a money lender for the wedding. Now, everything has gone up in flames.”
 
 Mayna got both of her girls engaged to Ramzan and Sheikh Raju, two youths from the shanties nearby. “Mayna had saved up all these years for their wedding.,” recounted Ranu Begum, Raju’s mother.
 
 “Since their shanty is very small, one of our neighbours allowed them to perform the haldi ritual and nikaah in an extra room he had,” Ranu said, pointing towards another bamboo structure draped in plastic sheets. “Even we lost everything in the fire. My son, who was supposed to buy his sherwani this afternoon, was trying to douse the flames,” she said.
 
 Their neighbours are trying to convince the grooms’ families not to postpone the marriage. However, they know that they do not have money to even pay the priest. “Perhaps we are not entitled to even a small moment of happiness,” Kalpana said, before breaking into tears.
