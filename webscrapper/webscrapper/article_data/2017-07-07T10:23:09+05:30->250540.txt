 “There are over 1,500 types of diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans, including a variety of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases. People having pets are at risk if their pets are not vaccinated,“ said Dr Bhagavan Reddy, district veterinarian officer for Hyderabad and an employee of the Super Speciality Veterinary Hospital in Narayanguda, where a free animal vaccination camp was organised on Thursday.
 
 “Yearly vaccination is a must for pets. Regular deworming for pets and maintaining hygiene is very important. People also need to be careful while consuming meat, milk and eggs. If they are not cooked properly, there is a chance of contracting a zoonotic disease,“ he said.
 
 Over 1,250 vaccinations were administered during the drive. Also present was Dr D Venkateswarlu, director of Telangana government's animal husbandry department. The event was part of a series of camps in 100 cities in India conducted by Indian Immunologicals Ltd.
