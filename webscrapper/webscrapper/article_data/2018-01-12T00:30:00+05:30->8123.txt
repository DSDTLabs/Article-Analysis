Trichy: The State Highways Department continued its anti-encroachment drive on Thursday, removing more than 200 illegal shelters from Uyyakondan Bridge till Somarasanpettai on Vayalur road. The department, which commenced the two-drive on Wednesday, carried out the eviction with help of revenue officials and police personnel.

 A stretch connecting densely-populated residential localities like Puthur, Shanmuga Nagar, Ramalinga Nagar, the 25-metre wide Vayalur Road was heavily infested with illegal shops and makeshift shelters, upsetting the free vehicular movements.
 
 The district administration asked the highways department to evict the encroachments, after haphazard parking of vehicles in the stretch had been causing traffic snarl-ups. Following this, the highways department embarked an eviction drive beginning from Uyyakondan Bridge and went on till Somarasanpettai.
 
 “Around 3 metres of the road was found taken up by illegal vendors on Vayalur road. Six heavy vehicles were used for the eviction to expedite the works,” a senior Highways Department official said.
 
 “Encroachments are a major reason for bottlenecks in traffic but they are not only reason. Unscientific parking of vehicles, mostly two-wheelers, is another reason why Vayalur and Heber roads leading to Bhima Nagar see traffic snarl-ups frequently. The traffic police should take severe actions against people hindering traffic by parking their vehicles,” H Jaiprakash, a resident of Ramalinga Nagar told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, shops have sprung back to life along the square in the arterial stretch where evictions drive was completed a few months ago. The highways department, which carried out the eviction on EB road, Marakkadai, and Thanjavur main road, said it has planned for a follow-up on the roads where.
 
 Sources said that the official would hold inspections on these roads in the next three months to ensure that no illegal shelter has come up there again.
