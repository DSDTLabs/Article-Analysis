PANAJI: The Government College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Quepem, has cleared the first hurdle in its path to becoming the second autonomous institute of higher education in Goa.

 The institute has already received a nod from Goa University. The proposal is now awaiting a nod from the University Grants Commission.
 
 Under the the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development’s National Institutional Ranking Framework ( ) the Quepem institute was ranked 53rd this year, ahead of the Goa University’s 60th rank.
 
 “We expect that the Government College, Quepem, will be offered autonomy on a platter by the UGC due to it being in the top 75 colleges in the country in the NIRF ranking. Autonomy will definitely mean more work for teachers, but the teachers had overwhelmingly supported the college’s decision to seek autonomy,” said Bhaskar Nayak, former principal of the college who initiated the process of obtaining autonomy for the government institute.
 
 In 2016, the Quepem college was sanctioned a central government grant of Rs 4 crore for infrastructure development after it was chosen as a model degree college under the government of India’s Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA). Under the scheme, colleges receive the funds in exchange for carrying out some comprehensive academic and administrative reforms.
 
 With a score of 3.23 CGPA, the Quepem college was awarded the highest score for a government degree institute in Goa, by the   (NAAC), Bengaluru, during the second cycle of accreditation in 2016. This score makes the college the third ranked institute of higher education in Goa.
