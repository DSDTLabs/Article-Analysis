 The much-awaited and also one of the most ‘shrouded in controversies’ movie, re-titled 'Padmaavat', is slated to release in less than a week. However, at the time of going to press only two tracks — ' ' and ' ' have been released by the filmmakers.  , is a composer par excellence and revered for his classically-soaked numbers. and it is rather disheartening that his album 'Padmaavat' has only two songs till date.
 
 The first track, 'Ek Dil Ek Jaan', reminds you of another SLB masterpiece, 'Laal Ishq' (' ', 2013). That remains, arguably, one of the best songs sung by Arijit Singh. 'Ek Dil Ek Jaan' is on similar lines. This Shivam Pathak- track has a similar classical background with plenty of nuanced harkatein and a masterfully sung alaap. The qawaali chorus is beautiful and has been rendered by Mujtaba Aziz Naza, Kunal Pandit and Farhan Sabri. This track is all set to be one of the most popular romantic songs because of SLB’s applaud-worthy composition, lyrics (AM Turaz) and the way it has been sung by Shivam. 
 
 The second song, 'Ghoomar', has been on the Mirchi Top 20 charts since the last five weeks and is not showing any chance of moving away from there. This typically traditional song is a dance track, and is too similar to SLB’s earlier compositions, and opulent presentation of 'Nagada' ('...Ram-Leela') and 'Deewani Mastani' ('Bajirao Mastani'). Shreya Ghoshal has done an excellent job on this one.
