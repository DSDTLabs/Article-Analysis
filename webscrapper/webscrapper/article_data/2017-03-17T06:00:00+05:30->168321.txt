With the release date just a week away, Pawan Kalyan’s   has managed to create quite the buzz — all for the right reasons. Produced by   under the   banner, Katamarayudu is releasing on March 24 and its makers are going all out to ensure the movie lives up to the high expectations. If opinions of  , director of cinematography, are anything to go by, the movie promises to be a visual treat, glimpses of which can be seen in the elaborately shot title song. 
“The film has   as a farmers’ hero. And so we shot the song over six days at a village called Anajpur in the outskirts of Hyderabad. Kalyan, being a nature lover, insisted that the song be shot in the midst of nature and trees,” says Prasad, adding that the song has a record number of 300 dancers. 
 “We wanted a pan-Indian feel for the song since Kalyan is being portrayed as a hero for society as a whole. And so we got 100 Sikh swordmen, 100 pehalwans and coolies, school students and old people for the song. The entire span of the song was so huge that we had to use drone cameras to get some picturesque aerial footage as well,” says Prasad, adding equal emphasis was also put to accentuate the visual appeal of all songs.
  The cast and crew travelled to Italy earlier this month to shoot two more songs. “Both are romantic songs and Italy was the perfect location. One song was shot in the vicinity of a castle while another was shot in the midst of hills with streams flowing in the background. After seeing some of the footage, Kalyan was confident that the audience will love every bit of the songs,” says Prasad, signing off.
