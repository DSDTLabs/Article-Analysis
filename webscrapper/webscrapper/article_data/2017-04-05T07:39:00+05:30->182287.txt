KOLKATA: Calcutta high court, on Tuesday, directed the   to grant permission to the   (RUS) for a three-day mela at the crossing of   and Jessore Road. The police and fire department have also been directed to grant permissions before the mela starts on Wednesday. The RUS first organised the mela in 2016 after receiving necessary clearances from the civic body, police and fire department. When they applied to the municipality for permission on March 22 this year, the civic body refused to grant it after which RUS moved court.

 While  , councillor, Ward 40,  , told TOI that permission was refused as there is a nursing home barely 50 metres from the spot where the mela is held and senior citizens from the area have raised concerns with the blaring loudspeakers during the mela, it was submitted in court by the civic body that the organisers should seek permission from the police and fire department first. Justice Harish Tandon wasn’t pleased when RUS counsel   pointed out that the police and fire department only grant clearance after going through the municipality permission. 
 
 “The conduct of the municipality is apathetic and lethargic. This is unfortunate. There is no justification behind the delay in granting permission by the municipality. Why such apathy towards this particular Puja? What do you do with other Pujas? Events are held on a regular basis by setting up a dais. For how many of these do you grant permission? The South Dum Dum Municipality is directed to give permission for the Puja with the same conditions as last year. The police and fire department will do the same,” Justice Tandon observed. 
 
 This is the second time in the last few months that authorities in the state have been hauled up by the high court for not granting permission to such events. 
 
 According to RUS member Nabyendu Bandyopadhyay, Jagaddhatri Puja is organised at the venue every year but nobody objects. “Why so much opposition now,” he said.
