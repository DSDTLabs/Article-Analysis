BENGALURU: Counsel for former chief minister B S   on Friday claimed there is nothing in the preliminary inquiry report of the   ( ) to suggest the former CM had demanded or accepted any money vis-à-vis his recommendations to the   for not including certain pieces of land from the final notification of the Shivaram Karanth Layout project.

 Senior advocate C V Nagesh, appearing on behalf of Yeddyurappa, submitted the report does not suggest any basic evidence required to constitute offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act wherein demandacceptance are necessary ingredients.“Except saying that some notes are missing and some holes are found in some pages of documents, ACB has not questioned any witness. The probe so far is like a blind person searching in a dark room for a black cat which was not there,“ Nagesh submitted.
 
 He contended Yeddyurappa had admitted that his communication to BDA is administrative in nature and hence no criminality can be attached to those office notes as per the verdict of the apex court.
