CHANDIGARH: Continuing with the plan of expanding the party's footprint in the state,   (TMC) Jagmeet Singh Brar on Sunday inaugurated two more offices of the West Bengal-based political organization in Sri Muktsar Saheb and Faridkot.

 Speaking on the occasion, Brar said, “I am in touch with a large number of former Congress colleagues who are fed up with the royal ways of Amarinder (  chief Captain  ) and his coterie of brokers and in the coming days they will be joining the TMC.“
 
 He brushed aside allegations that he was poaching AAP leaders in a big way. “Yes, I am in touch with a lot of friends in AAP , we have common goals and a common mission for Punjab so if they place their faith in the TMC who am I to close doors on them. TMC is not actively poaching leaders and volunteers of AAP , but we will not turn away anyone who comes to us with faith and hope,“ he added.
 
 While responding to a query on the possibility of a pre-poll alliance with AAP , the for mer MP said, “I have been saying this repeatedly , TMC is keen on an alliance and in the greater interest of Punjab we are being very flexible. The ball is now in AAP's court and they must realize the importance of standing united. TMC will fight 'parivarwaad' and 'rajwadashahi' in Punjab regardless of the outcome of the alliance.All that needs to be decided is if we will walk together or separately .“
 
 TMC sources said that Brar may travel out of Punjab shortly for a meeting with TMC national president and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to take the final decision in the coming days.
