TV actor  , who is currently playing the role of   in the show 'Porus', has another challenge he has to face. He will be enacting the role of   (Kumbhakrna’s son) in the show '  — Ant Hi Aarambh Hai'. Juggling two costume drama roles will be a difficult task but the actor is not complaining. He says, “Luckily both the shows belong to the same production house and the sets are located in  . So, I don’t have any clash of dates and I also don’t have to keep running to different sets. When I am shooting for 'Porus', I don’t shoot for 'Mahakali' and vice versa. Sometimes it could also involve shooting for both the shows in two shifts. It does get physically very exhausting but I am enjoying this feat. The challenge is more about getting ready for the role. It takes a lot of hours to get ready for both the roles.”
Chirag also needs to maintain a good physique to look the part. He says, “We have a gym specially set up for the actors to maintain their fitness levels. I never miss going to the gym because that comes first. If I start looking weak, I won’t look good onscreen, so even if I finish my shooting at 12 am, I go to the gym, complete my workout and then hit the bed.”
 The actor who has been in Umbergaon for the last four months is missing Mumbai. “Umbergaon is a village and so if you are not shooting, there is nothing much to do. It is difficult to pass time here. I am missing home terribly, but right now can’t afford to go to Mumbai,” he signs off.
