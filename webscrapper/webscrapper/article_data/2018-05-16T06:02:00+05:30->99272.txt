Two corporators, Rajendra Janjal of Shiv   and Feroz Moinuddin Khan of MIM, were arrested on Tuesday for their alleged role in the   that rocked Aurangabad recently. 

 A local court remanded both the corporators in four days of police custody. Janjal was allegedly found accompanying the rioters who torched properties and vehicles near Bharatiya Nursing Home on Friday night, police said, adding that there was proof against Khan too about his involvement in the riots. 
 
 Janjal, who represents the Shivajinagar area, initially resisted the arrest while Khan, an elected member from Nawabpura area, surrendered before police. Nawabpura is one of the areas that suffered huge losses during the riots. 
 
 Both the corporators were charged with committing mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy property. Police too have come under fire after video clips and CCTV footage showed some of their personnel accompanying the rioters who torched properties and vehicles.
 
 A team of senior police officers had gone to Khan's house, but he was not there. Around the same time, deputy commissioner of police (zone-II) Rahul Shrirame, a couple of assistant commissioners of police and senior inspector Avinash Aghav, along with riot control police, reached Janjal's house. 
 
 Janjal's supportersfollowed by former Sena MLA Pradeep Jaiswal and Sena district president Ambadas Danveprevented police from arresting him. It was only after deliberations lasting over an hour that Janjal agreed on the condition that he was not forced to sit in the police van. He was formally arrested at the Kranti Chowk police station.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (zone-I) Vinayak Dhakne said, "Both have been arrested based on crucial evidences We will further probe the involvement of the other suspects who assisted them."
