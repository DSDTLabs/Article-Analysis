THANE: The special NDPS court ordered attachment of three Mumbai flats of former Bollywood actor  , a co-accused with international drug baron   in a Rs 2,000-crore drug case.

 
 The order was given by the special court of H M Patwardhan. The three flats are at Sky enclave society in Versova, Andheri. One is on the first floor, another on the second and the third on the seventh. The three flats are collectively worth at least Rs 20 crore.

 Hirey said that the order states that the application was moved last year, the application was kept pending and opportunity was granted to both the accused to appear in the court. Hence, it is apparent that they are not likely to appear before the court in response to proclamation unless harsh action is initiated. The court directed the prosecution to take possession of the properties by affixing seals on entrance of building and not to deal with the property unless permitted by the court.
 
 The prosecution produced documents proving ownership by Kulkarni. Details of the flats were sought and submitted in court. On June 6, Kulkarni and   were declared as 'proclaimed offenders by the sessions court in Thane.
