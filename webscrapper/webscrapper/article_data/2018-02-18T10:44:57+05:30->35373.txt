PONDA: A new war has been going on for a couple of days between   and the inquiry committee that was constituted by the dairy over alleged corruption and the validity of the inquiry committee. Both the parties blame each other through press conferences.

 The inquiry committee has issued an ultimatum to dairy functionaries including chairman  , managing director N C Sawant and accounts head Radhika Kale to either prove the corruption charges leveled against them within a month or resign from their offices.
 
 A couple of days ago, chairman of the inquiry committee   had told some reporters that there was corruption in Goa Dairy right from procurement of milk to purchase of machinery and recruitment of a clerk from Karwar, Karnataka. He also produced some documents showing the alleged irregularities. The next day, the dairy convened a press conference, refuted the allegations and charged that Sanvordekar has been defaming the dairy. 
 
 The chairman claimed that they would discuss in the meeting, held on Saturday, whether to lodge a police complaint to get the dairyâ€™s affairs investigated by police.But, the meet did not discuss the issue.
