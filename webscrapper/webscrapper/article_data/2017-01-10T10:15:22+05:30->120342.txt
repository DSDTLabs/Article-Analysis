THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 54-year-old woman from Canada had a narrow escape on Monday, when she was attacked by a tusker at   here. The elephant pushed the woman down with its trunk as she was trying to pat it, but she escaped with a minor fracture on her left ankle. 

 An ardent lover of elephants, Sangeetha, originally from Kerala and now a  , was on a visit to the elephant rehabilitation centre as a guest of the forest and wildlife department. 
 
 "This particular elephant is a troublemaker and has a history of attacking mahouts. The woman was told not to go near him, but she didn't take heed to our warnings," said a forest official.
 
 The woman came to the centre in the morning and offered the elephant a pineapple and tried to pat him on the trunk. "The elephant pushed the woman to the ground and she got injured. Usually we don't allow visitors to touch elephants, especially adult ones, but in her case, there was a bit of confusion as she was the guest of a top official. Besides she assured the mahout that she knew about elephants and can manage," the official said.
 
 The woman, however, admitted it was her fault, the official said adding that one needs to be careful about the inherent wild nature of such animals even if they are domesticated. The woman was taken to the   Medical College, where the fracture on her left ankle was detected, and was later admitted to a private hospital for further treatment.
