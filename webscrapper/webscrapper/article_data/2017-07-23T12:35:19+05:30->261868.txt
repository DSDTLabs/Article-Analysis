We have tried to convince the juniors that their identity will not be disclosed as it is the responsibility of the college to stop ragging,” said Khare. “Unfortunately, none of them has come forward.” Director, NLIU, Prof S S Singh, told media that a probe has been ordered but claimed that the complaints were not entirely true as some people named in the complaint do not exist on campus. 
 
 Singh said, “Everything in the complaints is not true.” He added, “Hostel warden and the proctorial board are investigating the complaints and will come out with their findings shortly,” he said. Junior students in their complaint alleged that seniors ragged freshers and even forced them to watch porn films till 5 in the morning. Student alleged that even teachers and wardens knew about liquor being consumed in the hostel, yet they turned a blind eye to it. Some freshers have also accused some senior students of sexual abuse and molestation. 
 
 The administration has summoned the senior students who have been named in the complaint. he juniors have also alleged that a section of seniors torture them regularly. “Ragging in NLIU is very bad. I come from a very orthodox background where we don’t abuse, but here every senior uses foul and abusive language,” a student writes in his complaint.
