SURAT:   (SMC) plans to develop the   from Dumas Langar to Morarji Desai statue for   for people at a cost of   after monsoon.

  The project would include installation of seven-foot high metal statue of former Prime Minister Morarji Desai and construction of interactive fountains, cultural performance area, new gateway to sea, café, vibrant pathway, play area for children, walkway, shaded avenues, music and public address system, sculptures and LED displays among other things. The work would be done in phases. The first phase is likely to be completed in 10 months. Vishal Shah, the architect who designed Gopi Talav, has conceptualized this project too. 
 
 D M Jariwala, in-charge of the project, said, “The second phase of the project would be done in consultation with forest department. The forest land near the sea would be taken up for development by SMC and forest department in the second phase. This stretch would have an eco park and an amusement park too.” 
 
 Local politicians have been for the past five years promising people development along Dumas seashore. Unavailability of land has delayed the development project from taking off here. Another problematic issue is that the land comes under Coastal Reserve Zone (CRZ) here. 
 
 “We have some land of revenue department but most of it is under water now. This land has to be reclaimed first and then developed,” a SMC officer said.
