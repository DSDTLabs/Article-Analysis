CHENNAI: Actor Trisha’s mother   lodged a complaint with the city police commissioner’s office seeking action against people who “hacked into”   and  .

 Actor   found herself in the eye of a storm when she went against jallikattu. The actor, a campaigner for animal rights organisation Peta, deleted her social networking account after facing countless attacks online. She said she deactivated the account after it was hacked. 
 
 On Saturday, a group of jallikattu supporters protested against Trisha while she was shooting for ‘Garjanai.’ She was forced to leave the shoot midway.
 
 On Monday her mother Uma Krishnan approached the police top brass and said her daughter was never an active campaigner for Peta. “Since her school days she was a dog lover. Peta tied up with her for a photo shoot to adopt strays, and it had a good reach,” she said.
 
 “We are Tamilians. We are not against jallikattu. Someone has hacked her (Trisha’s) Twitter account and made a post. We have been in the cinema field for more than 15 years and have not seen such a tough situation,” said Uma Krishnan.
 
 Citing the stalling of the film shoot, she has sought protection for her daughter and the film crew.
