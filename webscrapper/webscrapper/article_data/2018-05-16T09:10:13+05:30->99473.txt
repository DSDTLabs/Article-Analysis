ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court has granted bail to Dr  , one of the nine accused in the death of several children at   (BRD) Medical College,  , allegedly due to disruption in oxygen supply. 

 On Tuesday, HC Justice Yashwant Varma granted bail to Dr  , who was head of anaesthesia department and was reportedly in-charge of oxygen supply at the time of the children's death in August, 2017.
 
 The petitioner had filed a bail petition, stating that he had been in jail for the last seven months. He also said he was in charge of oxygen maintenance and not its supply, hence had no role in the tragedy. His counsel also argued that Kumar's co-accused were released on bail in the matter and denied that Kumar had taken leave before the incident without informing the authorities concerned.
 
 Earlier, the HC had granted bail to Manish Bhandari, director of the oxygen supplier company Pushpa Sales, and Dr  , another accused in the case. It had, however, denied bail to BRD college former principal Dr   and his wife Dr Purnima Shukla.
 
 An FIR was registered on August 23, 2017, against nine people in connection with the death of over 30 children at the medical college on August 10-11, 2017, allegedly due to disruption in oxygen supply.
