Almost five years after his science fantasy, Adhisaya Ulagam, Shakthi Scott is ready with his next —  . The film, which also stars him in the lead, revolves around a car race.

 The director says, “The story is set against the backdrop of a car race, but humour is an intergral part of the narration. Five racers get caught in a trap. How they manage to escape the situation is what the film is about.”
 
 Tell Shakthi that not many Tamil films have racing as its backdrop and he says, “I wanted to try out something different in each of my films and that’s why I chose this genre. Even in my first film (Adhisaya Ulagam, which had Livingston play a maverick scientist), I experimented by basing it on dinosaurs. Even if racing has been explored in films, they haven’t used comedy in it.” While Pandiarajan plays a race conductor,   will be seen in the role of an antagonist. “He also has a song in the film, in which he appears as   and   among others. We have shot the film on highways and in green matte format,” he informs us.
