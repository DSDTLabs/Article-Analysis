Lucknow: Each division of the state—and gradually, every district—will get a training school for drivers of heavy vehicles, said   Aditya Nath Yogi. He added that he was not happy with the quality of training being imparted by the private ITIs (Industrial Training Institutes). “The training module as well as examination system in these institutes must change,” said Yogi, addressing media persons, along with Union   minister (independent charge)   here on Saturday. 

 The chief minister said there were 286 government ITIs in the state and around 2,500 private ones and all that is happening there is either an exam or election. He added that soon, examinations in ITIs would be held online and results will be declared within 24 hours and this would check irregularities. 
 
 The government plans to open heavy vehicle drivers’ training schools at all 18 divisions in the state and later, in all the districts, said the chief minister, adding, state government will provide 5 acres land in each division for the school. 
 
 Addressing media persons, Rudy said previously, skill development programmes held in 50 different departments of 23 ministries had now been brought under one ministry. Appreciating the state government’s Rs 150-crore budget for skill development, Rudy announced an additional Rs 200 crore to be given by the Centre so that the skill development campaign could reach the village level. 
 
 He asked officials to work towards training youth in traditional craft in the district of origin. For example, he said training in saree making should be imparted in Varanasi, for making brass utensils in Moradabad, for preparing petha in Agra, etc. 
 
 These traditional specialities are on the verge of extinction and proper training can on one hand preserve them and on the other hand provide jobs to lakhs in the state, he said.
