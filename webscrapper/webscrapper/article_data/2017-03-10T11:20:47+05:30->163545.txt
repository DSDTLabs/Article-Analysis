VADODARA: Why are thousands of residents in Munjmahuda and Atladra living in a stinking hell since years? Thanks to Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) oversight, lakhs of tonnes of garbage has been piling up in Atladara on a plot of land that was never meant to be a dumping site. 

 The plot is surrounded by large number of residential societies whose residents are constantly living with the stench of rotting garbage. The plot houses a plant for processing organic waste but it has stopped operations since 2014. Shockingly, the civic body did not even bother to dispose three lakh tonnes of waste that is rotting at the place.
 
 Even before 2014, the plant was able to process only a part of the waste as the solid waste being brought there had a large quantity of inorganic waste. VMC has now woken up to the problem and invited expressions of interest to dispose this waste. 
 
 People living in the vicinity of this dump claim that the waste continued to be dumped at the site even after the plant stopped operations.  , a security guard living in area even showed a vehicle coming to the site with garbage. “One often gets smell of rotting carcasses in the area,” he said.
 
 VMC officials said that when the plant began operations in 1977, a bulk of the waste being brought there was organic. “The nature of the waste changed over the years with nearly 50 to 60 per cent of the waste being inorganic. The   in 2014 asked us to stop using the plant,” said an official.
 
 The VMC is now eyeing to rope in a contractor who uses latest technologies and an innovative business model to for dealing with the legacy waste at the site. “The contractor may have to set up a plant at the site itself and process the waste,” said VMC’s additional city engineer   who is also in charge of the solid waste department.
