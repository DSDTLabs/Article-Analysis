For the past week or so, all anyone across the country has been talking about is the   elections. While everyone has their own opinions about the state of affairs, director   has a unique take.
 
  In a post uploaded on Twitter earlier today, Shashank compared the political situation in Karnataka to  's popular song Ee Deshad Kathe Ishte Kanammo from the 1991 film  .
  
  He especially alluded to the lines, "Ee deshada kathe ishte kannamo. Illi chinte maadi laabha illamo. Nyayada manegilglu, yeradu anthe bagalu. Munde hogi, hinde baro, ee deshada kathe ishte kannamo. Illi chinte maadi laabha illamo."
