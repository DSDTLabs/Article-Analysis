Big or small, lies are lies! So, what happens when you get entangled in a web of lies? That is exactly the situation that Jaiveer Chopra, the protagonist of Sony SAB’s new show, ' ', faces. 
  will play Jaiveer, thus ending his eight-year-long absence from TV. The show will premiere tonight, and will air every Monday to Friday at 9 pm on SAB TV. 
 Talking about his return to television, Hussain says, “I was looking for something light-hearted and fun. Also, I play a guy who lies to win his girlfriend’s heart. The character attracted me because I am a very bad liar. Also, I am not rich like Jaiveer.” 
 The story revolves around the super-rich Chopra clan, which includes Paramveer ( ), his son Jaiveer and daughter Jenice (Urmila Tiwari). Jaiveer falls in love with a simple, middle-class girl, Jaya ( ). Jaiveer is taken aback when she tells him that she and her family, especially her dad Lalitrao Lonkhande ( ), detest the rich. In order to marry Jaya, he then creates a fake poor family out of the Chopras. And, thus starts the comical journey of hits and misses. 
 Neeraj Vyas, senior EVP & Head, Channel SAB and MAX cluster of channels said, “We are presenting a fresh take on situational comedy arising simply due to the vice of ‘lying’. The first season, 'Sajjan Re Jhooth Mat Bolo', resonated well with our audience and we hope they love the new version even more.”
