HYDERABAD: At a time when the Special Investigation Team is facing flak for treating politicians and policemen, who had links with gangster  , with kid gloves, reports surfaced on Sunday that Nethi Vidya Sagar, deputy chairman of the  , was questioned by the sleuths a few days ago. However,   officials denied it. 

 The ‘news’ assumes significance as the   session begins on March 10. Reports have emerged that Vidya Sagar was questioned 10 days ago by the SIT team in Nalgonda. It seem he was questioned earlier too when he was in Hyderabad. 
 
 When SIT in-charge Nagi Reddy was contacted for authentication of the report, he flatly denied it. When efforts were made to contact MLC Vidya Sagar, he too denied it by saying that the SIT had not contacted him in the Nayeem case till now . “The reports about police questioning me is absolutely false. Till date, police have not contacted me. There is no case against me in the first place. In the complaint registered by Nagendar too, my name is not mentioned in the FIR,’’ Vidya Sagar told TOI. 
 
 After Nayeem was killed in an encounter last year and the police started a crackdown on his associates, businessman Nagendar from Nalgonda lodged a complaint alleging that Nayeem had threatened to kill him at behest of Vidya Sagar.
