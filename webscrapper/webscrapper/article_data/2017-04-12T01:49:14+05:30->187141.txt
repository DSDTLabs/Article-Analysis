NOIDA/ GREATER NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: In a bid to fulfil the ‘Power for All’ pact (with 24-hour supply to cities and districts and 18-hour supply in rural areas) to be signed by UP chief minister   and Union power minister Piyush Goyal on April 14, the distribution and transmission departments of   and   have undertaken a slew of measures and started round-the-clock work of upgradation of the power lines including replacing defective transformers and supplying energy to high-capacity conductors.

 From acquiring GPS-enabled vehicles (used to replace defective transformers) to energising a 765-kV substation in Jahangirpur on Yamuna expressway (currently under way) and a 400-kV substation in Sector 48 to be commissioned by June 17, are some of the measures in this direction.
 
 “Since Noida is a ‘no power cut zone’ we are currently working on preventing breakdowns. Every year there’s a 10% increase in load which adds an extra burden on existing transformers. Hence we are in the process of upgrading and checking defects in transformers,” A K Singh, executive engineer, PVVNL, told TOI.
 
 According to Rajiv Goyal, Greater Noida distribution department, the problem for Noida, Greater Noida and   (NGG) is non-availability of adequate transmission capacity. “Apart from a765-kV substation at Jahangirpur, Yamuna expressway and a 400-kV substation in Sector 48 by June 17, a 400-kV substation is expected bo be ready in Indirapuram by July 17,” Rajiv Goyal said. After these projects are up and running, the transmission to NGG area would be increased by up to 1,500MW.
 
 Rajeev Gupta executive engineer PVVNL, stationed at Noida’s Sector 20 substation, said the power department was hiring GPS-enabled vehicles to address problems related to transformers. 
 
 Other measures include minimum time for shutdowns where necessary.
