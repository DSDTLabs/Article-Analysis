LUCKNOW: As he turned 25 on Sunday,   Ansari was more than a happy young man. He became the youngest candidate to contest UP elections after being gifted a ticket by   chief  .

 Son of gangster-turned-politician  , Abbas was announced BSP candidate from   assembly seat in Mau on January 26, when his father’s Quami Ekta Dal merged with BSP. But at that time, he was under-age and could not have contested an election. “He is surely the youngest of all candidates,’’ claimed his uncle and former MP Afzal Ansari, confirming that on Sunday, Abbas was finally eligible to file nomination. “He is likely to file his nomination on February 15,’’ said Ansari, speaking to TOI.
 
 After winning gold in National Shooting Championship in Delhi in 2013 and then in Jaipur in 2015, Abbas made his first political appearance at Mayawati’s residence where he was introduced as a party candidate and a “young leader” by the BSP chief. His father Mukhtar is lodged in jail—prime accused in murder of BJP MLA Krishnanad Rai—so Abbas came with his two uncles Afzal and Sibghatullah. The latter has been given a ticket from Mohammadabad assembly constituency in Ghazipur district.
 
 Like his father, Abbas will also start his political career contesting on a BSP ticket. Mukhtar won his first Assembly election as a BSP candidate in 1996. Soon after his candidature was announced, Abbas started holding public meetings in his assembly constituency, said Afzal. “I am supporting him in his campaign,’’ he told TOI.
 
 Ansari family is said to wield considerable influence in parts of eastern UP, essentially in districts like Mau, Ghazipur, Ballia and Varanasi. Their inclusion in BSP could, therefore, arm Mayawati to play her Muslim card in the politically crucial region which goes to poll in the sixth and seventh phase of UP assembly elections.
