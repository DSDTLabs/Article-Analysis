CHANDIGARH: The Haryana unit of the   (AAP) on Sunday termed Indian National Lok Dal’s (INLD) “Jal Yudh” over the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue a feature film scripted by   (SAD) wherein INLD and Chautalas have acted as actors.

 AAP Haryana in-charge Navin Jaihind alleged that SAD has not only helped INLD and its leaders to conduct this as face saving exercise, but this was apparently the last gesture by Badals to help out their family friends Chautalas with their support. Jaihind was referring to Chautalas and their claims of having severed all kind of relations with Badals in the interest of SYL issue. 
 
 “Let Badals or Chautalas justify the support and facilities provided by Punjab government like house staff for the past 10 years. Family ties between Badals and Chautalas are an open secret,” said Jaihind.
