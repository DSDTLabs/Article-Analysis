NEW DELHI: A JD(U) emissary was insistent when he spoke with BJP leaders in Delhi on Wednesday evening: The alliance would have to be announced immediately and the oath of office taken at the earliest. The JD(U)’s concern was not necessarily because time was running out or fear of a legal challenge. 

 It was driven by the possibility that   chief   may buckle under pressure and get son   to quit as deputy CM, depriving   of a valid reason to break with his ally.
 
 Nitish, sources said, had made up his mind to jettison the alliance after the graft charges levelled by BJP’s   as well as the FIR registered by   against Lalu, wife Rabri and Tejashwi raised the political heat in Bihar.
 
 The swift pace of developments took even senior BJP leaders by surprise and it was only around 8 pm that party functionaries came to know of what was afoot when they received instructions that party MLAs were to reach Nitish’s residence in a show of solidarity.
 
 There remained the possibility of a legal challenge as RJD has the largest number of MLAs in Bihar, but this was not a deterrent as the arithmetic of the assembly ensured that no government could be formed without BJP and JD(U).
