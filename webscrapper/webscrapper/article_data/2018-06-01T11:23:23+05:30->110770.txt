COIMBATORE: The school education department is yet to train teachers in the new syllabus even as the schools are scheduled to reopen on Friday and Class I,  , IX and XI students are all set to start lessons with the new textbooks.

 Pointing out that the textbooks have already been supplied to the schools across the district, an education department said the training sessions for teachers handling the new syllabus might be conducted from June second week.
 
 The textbooks have been upgraded incorporating website links and QR codes, which would take students to content uploaded on the Dhiksha portal. The teachers would be told how to use these features, the official said.
 
 “The plan is to train the resource persons, who will in turn train the teachers. Resource persons will be selected from both the schools and the colleges. They will be trained first and in July they would train the teachers,” the official said.
 
 Teachers from urban areas said while almost all of them were familiar with using smart phones, website links and QR codes, the training would help their counterparts in rural areas. Also, with the approach to the subjects has been upgraded in the textbooks, the training would help teachers handling subjects such as science and mathematics, said T  , district president of Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association.
 
 “While language teachers might find it easier to handle the content in the new textbooks, science and maths teachers will benefit from the training programme,” he said.
 
 There are, however, concerns on how effectively teachers could handle the new syllabus as they haven’t yet been imparted training. Both the teachers and the education officials said it would not be an issue.
