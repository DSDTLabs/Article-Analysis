JAIPUR: A busy railway line which passes through the   Leopard Conservation Reserve has turned into a death trap for endangered wild animals.

 A 15-year-old crocodile (male) was mowed down by a speeding train near Raghunathpura , Mori Station on Sunday .
 
 Scores of leopards, sloth bear, cattle have been crushed in the past few years in Jawai area after the frequency of passenger trains increased. Assistant conservator of forest,   informed TOI, “The crocodile was nearly 6-feet long. It seems the incident occurred late night when the crocodile was crossing railway track after coming out of Jawai Bandh.”
 
 Conservationists have suggested many measures to curb the accidents, however , none has been implemented so far.
 
 Shatrunjay Singh, a wildlife enthusiast and conservationist says, “We have proposed to fence railway track in 30km area between Perwa and Malani . It’s a serious issue as train passes through the core area, which is home to leopards.”
 
 In a further cause of worry, the railways is undertaking track-doubling work along the same stretch for Delhi -Mumbai freight corridor. The railways has already commenced work for the same in Jawai. “The underpasses designed in the area are not appropriate and it would not stop accidents. There is an urgent need to take up measures to reduce wildlife mortality due to train accidents in this area,” said  , a wildlife enthusiast.
