NEW DELHI: The Centre requested the   on Thursday to widen the scope of scrutiny of constitutional validity of   as a mode of divorce among Muslims to include examining the legality of the  . A bench of Chief Justice   and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud was sorting out the finer points and procedure for commencing final hearing on triple talaq from May 11 when advocate Madhavi Divan handed over four questions framed by the Centre for the court’s consideration.

 The CJI and the other judges read it and said, “The Centre has raised very valid and important constitutional questions. We will deal with them.” Divan said these questions were settled by attorney general Mukul Rohatgi. The CJI said, “This is a great opportunity to decide this issue (validity of triple talaq). It is such an important issue that we cannot keep on deferring it. If we do not avail of this opportunity to finish deciding this issue now, it can never be decided. 
 
 “An important aspect of the issues projected is whether triple talaq is a fundamental trait of religion? We will decide this first. If the answer to the question is affirmative, then the entire issue will have to be examined from a very different constitutional perspective.” However, the SC had clarified on Tuesday that it would not touch upon the issue relating to uniform civil code while examining the legality of triple talaq. The questions framed by the Centre are:
 
 1. Whether triple talaq and polygamy are protected under the fundamental right to religion guaranteed under Article 25 of the  ? 
 2. Whether right to religion is subject to important fundamental rights like right to equality (Article 14) and right to life (Article 21)? 
 3. Whether personal law can be termed as a law under Article 13 of the Constitution? 
 4. Whether triple talaq and polygamy are compatible with India's obligations under international treaties and covenants to which it is a signatory? 
 
 For the first time, the SC has laid down ground rules for the parties to argue. One important innovation is to curb the practice of handing over copies of judgments the parties are relying on to substantiate their arguments. The CJI said all parties must inform the Centre’s counsel of the judgments they would cite and that the Centre would prepare a master compilation for ready reference of all parties during arguments, which would commence on May 11. 
 
 The court said the spread of arguments by counsel for all parties should not exceed nine days. It could be stretched at best by two more days as the bench could sit even on Saturday and Sunday to complete the arguments.
