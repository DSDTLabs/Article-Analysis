CHANDIGARH: The prime accused in the 1991 Ghaziabad land scam of Uttar Pradesh was arrested from Panchkula on Wednesday after being on the run since last September.

 Retired   ( ) development officer Om  , 60, is accused of cheating 48 complainants of Rs 84 lakh, who say the figure can exceed Rs 100 crore, if all 135 plot buyers report the  . Chopra lives in Sector 12 of Panchklula. The economic offences wing (EOW) of Chandigarh Police had earlier arrested him with co-accused Hari Mohan Bajaj, 67. The scam was first reported in December 2015.
 
 Wing’s deputy superintendent of police   told TOI: “The 48 people who filed complaint against Chopra and Bajaj say the duo promised them residential and commercial land in Ghaziabad in 1991. They lured them via newspaper advertisements promoting a registered housing society scheme in Ghaziabad. Chopra was then in a government department in Chandigarh, where he is alleged to have made most of these deals and accepted the money.”
 
 Many complainants died in the course of this 25-year-old case and only 48 came forward out of the 135 victims of fraud. Many people who claimed to have paid the duo money in Chandigarh for buying plots in Ghaziabad said they had received neither land nor their money back. In 2015, 13 people made a written complaint to the UT deputy inspector general (DIG) of police and he ordered the Sector-19 cops to register an FIR (first-information report) against the accused duo. 
 
 Later, the investigation moved to the EOW. Police have secured the custody of the accused for three days.
