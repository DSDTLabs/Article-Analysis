Singers and musicians from several Bangla bands gathered at a rooftop music concert organised by Kaya

 
  
 Grand Reunion
 Musicians from across the city gathered on the terrace of Kaya drummer Bubai’s   house for a concert held by the members of the band recently. “This concert showcased a lot of young performers as well. While they get a platform to work with experienced musicians, veterans get rejuvenated by their energy,” said Gabu, who sang two Lakkhichhara numbers, Jani na and Paliye berai. 
 
 
  
 Musical Milieu
 Swamantak — son of Chandrabindoo’s   — and Debangsh — son of Kaya’s   — stole the show with their performances. “Both of them are in Class VI and had great fun at the do. Swamantak has been performing for a while now and he has no stage fright at all,” said Surajit, adding, “It was a lovely evening as we could meet many musicians at one place.”

 The evening was enjoyed by many music enthusiasts. Brother-sister duo, Sougato and Debjani, who came from the US, was spotted at the do.   Sengupta, who enthralled the audience with his stellar performance, said, “The audience here is lovely. I chose Anup Ghoshal’s Ek je ache konya and had great fun singing it.”
