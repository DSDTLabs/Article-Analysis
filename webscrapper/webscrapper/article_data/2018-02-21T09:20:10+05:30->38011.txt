CHANDIGARH: Balbir Kaur, 64, shudders to recall the time when a man snatched her gold chain. She was sitting outside her house in Sector 41 when the accused approached her on the pretext of asking about an address and pulled her gold chain. “I am in trauma. I am scared of even stepping outside my house. Women are not safe anywhere, even at the boundary of their houses. The spate in snatchings suggests criminals have no fear of the police,” Kaur said.

 Like her, many others are fearful. Tej Rani, 75, of Sector 45 said she was sitting outside her house when she felt someone had slapped her back. Later, she realized her gold chain was missing. Before she could react, the accused sped away on a bike. “The way snatchers are striking at will, it seems there is no law and order in the city. Chandigarh was a peaceful city once, but we are now not even safe in our homes, what to talk of roads,”   said.
 
 Police officials say snatchers prefer to target elderly women as they know there are little chances of the victims resisting or fighting back. “They generally approach their target on the pretext of asking directions,” said an inspector. Cyclists and pedestrians are another soft targets. In the past two days, miscreants snatched mobile phones from two cyclists at   and near the poultry farm roundabout. Miscreants mostly target cyclists or pedestrians commuting late at night, sources said. Police, on the other hand, claimed their strictness has ensured no jewellers buy chains from snatchers.
 
 However, snatchers are now mostly selling their booty in parts of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana.
