NEW DELHI: Following the  's fresh ruling on January 3 that an cricket administrator can't hold office for more than nine years cumulatively as opposed to nine years each at   and state units, the top BCCI and state officials will make it a talking point during their 'coffee pe charcha' in Bangalore on Saturday. The main agenda of the former BCCI president N Srinivasan-led faction is not to pack their bags and leave the cricket boardroom but to find ways and means to stay relevant in the cricket firmament.

 Sources said that if the way out of this crisis is to float something like a parallel body, so be it. However, another prominent member denied having any such plan. Without specifying on floating a parallel cricket body, the official revealed that exploring all legal options and challenging the nine-year contentious point would be the main option first and how to wriggle out of this piquant situation.
 
 "We are not told about floating a parallel body. But we have been told that the ineligible officials would be discussing how to stay relevant at the time when 99 per cent of the officials are out of the system. It could lead to a systematic collapse," a member of the state unit, who was also a part of the BCCI body, told TOI.
 
 The  , though, reiterated that floating a parallel body is completely out of question. Even coming in the way of implementing the Lodha reforms would lead to contempt of the Supreme Court order. For that, they would have to create 28 parallel associations and a main body like BCCI, which is completely impractical. The biggest challenge in front of them would be to transfer the property of the present associations, involving top players and getting recognition from the International Cricket Council.
