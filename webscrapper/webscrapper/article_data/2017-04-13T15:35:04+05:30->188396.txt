Actress   says she was averse to obliging her admirers with photographs but has changed her mindset over time. 

 The 34-year-old Oscar-winning actress says she has grown up as an artiste and hopes she did not hurt anyone in the past due to her behaviour.
 
  
  
 "I hope I wasn't a jerk to anybody, but in my head I was a jerk to people - a lot, for a period of time. And I just woke up one day and I just became so deeply flattered by it and saw it for what it is: it's just somebody giving you some of their energy in a nice way."
 
 "I don't know if it's motherhood or just growing up a little bit but people's time matters, you can do whatever you want with it," Hathaway said.
