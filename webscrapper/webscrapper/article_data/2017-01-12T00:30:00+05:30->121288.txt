BHOPAL/INDORE: Flyers had a harrowing time at Bhopal and Indore due to fog and non-availability of pilots on Tuesday. While Jet Airways flight S2-4171 to Mumbai was cancelled due to a weather report that claimed Bhopal’s weather would clear up only after 11am,   flight AI-9863 from Bhopal to Hyderabad via Jabalpur was delayed by two hours as the pilots had not competed their mandatory 14-hours rest quota.

 In Indore, arrival of most morning flights was delayed by 1-4 hours as fog reduced visibility to just 50 meters. Flyers were left hassled at both cities.
 
 Vishrut Acharya, GM of Air India in Bhopal told TOI that the airline is facing a shortage of pilots since some are on leave and others are on training. Passengers had reached the airport on time and did not take kindly to the delay. They created a ruckus demanding to know when it will take off. Those who had connecting flights were the worst hit. Scheduled for 10.55am, AI-9863 took off at 12.55pm, landed at Jabalpur at 2pm and reached Hyderabad at 4.30pm. “The pilot who flew the plane to Bhopal on Monday night was the only one available for Tuesday. However, the rules say a pilot has to be provided with 4 hours of rest. Hence the flight was delayed,” he said.
 
 Jet passengers were the next to be hit. Jet Airways city manager Wilson told TOI: “On Monday night, we received a weather report that said Bhopal’s sky will have dense fog till 11am. We decided to cancel the flight instead of delaying it. We informed the passengers on Monday night though text messages on their registered contact numbers. There were some who had to reach their destination urgently and turned up at the airport in the morning. There were 126 passengers booked on this flight and we managed to adjust five of them on the AI flight to Mumbai.” 
 
 Whenever flights from Indore get disrupted, it affects Bhopal residents, too, because many of them take the four-hour trip there to avail of better connectivity. In Indore, Indigo flight 6E-656 from Delhi was delayed by more than three hours. Scheduled to land at 7am, it touched down at 10.25am. Another flight on the same route, Jet Airways 9W 797, landed after a delay of nearly three hours at 11.10am. Jet Airways 9W-791 was delayed by 125 minutes and an afternoon flight of Air India-636 from Delhi was delayed by over an hour. Flights from Mumbai, Bengaluru, and other routes were also affected.
 
 The morning flight of Indigo from Bengaluru (6E-703) was delayed by 141 minutes and Indigo 6E-509 from Nagpur landed 67 minutes. Jet Airways’ flight 9W-7016 from Mumbai to Indore was delayed by around 205 minutes and Air India’s 635 on the same route was delayed by 147 minutes. Indigo 6E-619 from Hyderabad to Indore was late by around 45 minutes.
