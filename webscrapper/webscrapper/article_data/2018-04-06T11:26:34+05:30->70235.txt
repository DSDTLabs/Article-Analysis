LUCKNOW: The majority of   students are opposed to the proposal of multiple choice questions (MCQs) in undergraduate exams from the new academic session. 

 While most of them term it as a system that will confine the analytical and thinking power of students, some supported the proposal, saying there was a need for examination reform at LU.
 
 Terming the system 'mann se chaar questions (MCQ) pe tick', the students feel that guesswork will rule in exams while the other side feels it will ensure quality education as answering MCQs means studying the syllabus thoroughly.
 
 Students in support of teachers opposing the proposal said the system would make things difficult at PG and PhD levels as students would be out of practice to express. 
 
 "MCQ pattern is a threat to the development of writing skill and grammatically correct language," said BA student Amrita. 
 
 Law student   said, "MCQs will weaken individualistic ideas, debating and power of expression of a student and will drive them towards rote learning."
 
 Science students termed the system as one that would paralyse scientific temper and researches. 
 
 "The system will not help polish comprehension and analytical skills of science students. Publications in international scientific journals will become a distant dream as the researcher will not be able to express findings and conclusions," said BSc student  .
 
 However, there were arguments in support too. 
 
 "With MCQs, logic will work and not vague writing. Only one who is well-read will be able to answer and guesswork won't work as negative marking exists," said BCom student Ranvir Singh Rathore. 
 
 "Answer copies will be evaluated in no time and results declared timely. Objective questions will also make students go through the entire syllabus," said MBA student Ankit Srivastava.
