HYDERABAD: The CBI has asked the principal special judge for CBI cases in Hyderabad to cancel the bail granted three years ago to YSR Congress chief   in a disproportionate assets against the politician. 

 The CBI is investigating the case against Jaganmohan. The court on Tuesday sought a response from the politician and posted the case to April 7 for further hearing. The CBI cited a condition in the bail order that prohibits Jagan from making any effort to influence witnesses in the case. CBI DIG V   moved a petition claiming this condition had been violated by media owned by Jaganmohan, namely Sakshi TV channel and   newspaper, on February 26, 2017. 
 
 It said they had telecast and published on that date an interview with former AP chief secretary P   in which the ex-bureaucrat "spoke against the prosecution".
 
 He spoke about a key person in the   government and expressed doubts about the fate of the Jaganmohan assets case without that key person in the case, the CBI said, adding that this amounted to influencing witnesses and was, therefore, a violation of bail conditions. "In a bid to accommodate and shield the accused in the case, Ramakanth made unwarranted statements with regard to the investigation and also about the fate of the case at the trial," the CBI petition said.
