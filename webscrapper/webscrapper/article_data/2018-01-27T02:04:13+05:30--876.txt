NEW DELHI: Children stole the show at the  . There were those who were honoured for their bravery, and there were those who won hearts by braving the morning chill to perform cultural items. 

 The marching contingent of NCC girls always gets the maximum applause. This year was no different. But it were schoolchildren from Delhi and elsewhere who warmed hearts in the audience. 
 
 Over 500 such children with bare feet put together unique cultural items, each with a unique message. There were three troupes from Delhi. The first was Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Jahangirpuri, with 155 members that performed on a song named ‘Bharat ke rang’. The students tried to represent the multifaceted and varied cultural heritage of India.
 
 The other two were Mount Abu Public School, Rohini, and Oxford Foundation School, Najafgarh. The former had 150 students dressed in traditional attire of the 10 Asean countries apart from various Indian dresses. They performed to a special fusion piece. This one depicted the true spirit of unity, harmony and brotherhood—the core values on which Indo-Asean relations stand. 
 
 The Oxford school had 155 students dressed in bright shades of orange and green. 
 
 All these performances reflected the hard work put in by the students. Some of the moves, like forming human pyramids, were very well appreciated. 
 
 When the National Bravery Award winners arrived on Rajpath, they were cheered by the people, many of whom also became emotional. There were 18 awardees this year of whom three received it posthumously. One of the posthumous awardees was Netravati Chavan of Karnataka who jumped into a pond when she saw two boys struggling to stay afloat in a pond. She managed to save one of them, but died while trying to save the other.
