TRICHY: With private job markets looking congested and openings ever harder to come by, most engineering graduates in the city are making a beeline for public services examinations, hoping that it could end their long search for a stable career. 

 The trend was evident in the   prelims 2018 conducted in 17 centres across   on Sunday where a good number of engineering graduates tried their luck. For a majority of them, this was their last resort to land a job as finding one in an IT firm or in multinational corporation has now become difficult.
 
 “I passed out from college in 2014, but I have not been able to find the right job in Chennai. I stopped my job search and focused on clearing   examinations,” said V Sathish, a mechanical engineering graduate from P R Engineering College Thanjavur, who attended the prelims. Echoing the sentiment,  , who completed his civil engineering course in 2018, said that if he put in his whole effort towards clearing this examination, it would at least help him do better in other tests.
 
 Coaching academies in the city said that they were seeing a huge rise in the number of engineers enrolling for civil service exam coaching programmes. “We will start the coaching for the next year’s UPSC examinations on June 25. Interestingly, more than 80 per cent of the applicants are from engineering background. I expect this trend to continue at least for three more years,” said head of Shankar IAS Academy, Trichy branch, C Prabhakar.
 
 When it comes to clearing prelims, engineers hold an edge over the others because they are more familiar with aptitude test, the paper–II of the prelims. “Engineers have good reasoning skills. They are comfortable with aptitude paper more than the first paper which is general studies,” said   , director of NR IAS Academy, who has 17 out of a total of 24 candidates from engineering backgrounds in his academy.
