VISAKHAPATNAM: School education is all set to get costlier in   with the state government proposing to hike fees in each class by 12%. As of now, private educational institutions can hike their annual fees by 10%.

 The proposal is part of the draft AP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Act 2017, draft AP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Rules 2017 and Draft Model Code Disclosures 2017. The state government came up with the proposal in order to streamline the establishment and rein in the functioning of private schools. Currently, the government is seeking feedback from various stakeholders. However,   doesn’t end there as the zonal   regulatory committees, which will be constituted as part of the Rules, will take decisions on proposals received from schools regarding the proposed increase beyond the permissible limit. 
 
 Right to Education (RTE) Forum state convenor   said the draft rules are aimed at promoting corporate schools and watering down the existing   Act. “While neighbouring states like Telangana are proposing KG-to-PG free education, AP is giving a free hand to private schools,” said Prakasa Rao.
 
 The draft Bill mandates each recognised school to place all their information in public domain provided by the state government. These details shall include information about accreditation and affiliation of the school, its fee structure, facilities such as hostel and sports, student-teach ratio, and qualifications of teachers. Schools shall also furnish the details of major events being organised for students and teachers.
