Panaji: A resident of the Goa University girls’ hostel took to social media recently to complain about the allegedly poor quality of food served at the hostel  . The girl posted a picture of a dead cockroach in the dinner served to her on Saturday. 

 Several other girls living in the hostel have since shared her post and have commented about similar experiences. The students said that the ‘curfew time’ of 8pm for female residents of the   hostel prevents them from going out to eat elsewhere.
 
 “We are used to getting human   in our meals but this was completely new for me,” one female student said in response to the post.
 
 Responding to the post, other residents of the girls’ hostel said they had raised the issue with the warden, but there has not been any improvement in the quality of the meals served.
 
 “We don’t deserve to eat bugs and insects even if it is free and we have paid money, our parents’ hard-earned money. We don’t ask for luxurious food. But food that is hygenic,” a male student of Goa University said in response to the social media post.
 
 Efforts to get comments from Goa University officials did not yield a response. 
 
 Students also said that they have to go without eating at times as the food served at the hostel mess was inedible. They said they had already paid a considerable amount as hostel and mess charges and so cannot afford to eat out at night.
 
 “This is too much now. First spend around Rs 21k for d hostel n mess charges n wt we get in return is dis. This have been wrse frm past many days,” another resident of the GU hostel said commenting on the post.
