Pune: The Nationalist Congress Party ( ) has demanded detailed discussions on the infrastructural projects in PMC’s general body, claiming that BJP leaders were avoiding such talks on a common platform. 

 Chetan Tupe, NCP’s leader in PMC, said on Monday that most elected representatives in PMC, including a large numbers of BJP corporators, were unaware about the metro rail projects in the city. 
 
 There has been no clarity on many issues. Elected representatives should be informed while implementing these projects, he said.
 
 Tupe pointed out that the ruling BJP was pushing many decisions on allotment of civic spaces for infra projects without discussions. “Many corporators are unclear about utilization of civic spaces for infra projects. Recently, it was learnt that BJP corporators were not aware of the detailed project report of Shivajinagar-Hinjewadi metro route. It looks like the state government is implementing the projects without taking the local BJP unit and the civic administration into confidence. This cannot be the way to implement the projects. Lack of discussion would lead to misunderstanding,” he said.
