Mumbai: A disclosure by   to the stock exchanges, that   had bought nearly 31 lakh shares (1.1%) of the private sector lender between January and March this year, sent the former’s stock price to a 52-week high at Rs 162 on   in mid-session, on Tuesday. 

 Accompanied by heavy volumes, the stock settled at 9%, up at Rs 159. At an average price of Rs 126 per share during the March quarter, ICICI Bank’s cost of acquisition works out to Rs 38.8 crore. 
 
 Market sources, however, said that Karnataka Bank may have erroneously included shares pledged by ICICI Bank’s customers and categorised them as owned by the leading private sector bank. “Even if the shares are pledged to the bank, it actually belongs to the respective owners and does not belong to the bank,” said a market source. 
 
 A top official from Karnataka Bank, however, said the classification of ownership of its shares was done using the data it received from the depositories and the unique income tax  . “There can’t be any error from our side,” the official said. After the disclosure, the spurt in the price of Karnataka Bank was on the back of speculation that ICICI may be taking a stake in the lender for strategic reasons or even a complete takeover. To justify the bank’s stock price, traders and analysts also started comparing Karnataka Bank with its peers of similar size and reach in terms of branch network, loan books, NPA etc.
