AGRA/ FIROZABAD: A 52-year-old farmer collapsed and died in his field on Saturday morning apparently after suffering a stroke, which his family attributed to the stress caused by crop loss after Wednesday’s massive thunderstorm.
  
  Ravinder Singh, a resident of   village in   area, went to his field on Saturday morning, but, hours later, he was found dead by his family members. They rushed him to a nearby hospital but the doctors declared him brought dead.
  
  He is survived by wife and four children. One of his daughters is in hospital.
  
  “My father was in stress since the thunderstorm struck on Wednesday evening. A large portion of our crops was damaged. He was also worried about my younger sister’s health who is being treated in Shikohabad government hospital. I believe he couldn’t handle the stress of crop damage and died of shock,” said Yogesh Singh, Ravinder’s son.
  
  Soon after the incident, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM)   visited the farmer’s house. His body was also sent for post-mortem examination to ascertain the exact cause of the death.
  
  “We will conduct a survey of his farm. Once the post-mortem report reveals the cause of death, we will accordingly file a report and send it for compensation,” the officer said.
  
  Wednesday’s thunderstorm caused massive damage in the region. At least 25 people were killed in Agra, Firozabad and Mathura districts. Standing crops was also damaged in the region.
