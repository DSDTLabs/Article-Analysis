MANGALURU: Voting is the right of every citizen. Though netas and bureaucrats advocate this every day, for   and her children - living in   taluk for the past 25 years-they are neither voters, nor do they have electricity in their dwelling.

 The case of Janaki, who is in her fifties, was brought to light by activist  , who is working for social inclusion through Democratic Ambassador for   (DAARI), founded by him in the district.
 
 Soon after getting details of the family of three, the activist informed the Election Commission of the issue, after which the case was handed over to the tahsildar and village assistant.
 
 Bangera, who also had written to the Election Commission, recently, seeking voting rights for beggars in rehabilitation centres, told TOI that the government should ensure participation of all citizens in the election.
 
 "On the way to   from Bantwal, I see the family residing in a makeshift house near   every day. A few days ago, I visited the family and enquired about their plight, and asked them if they cast their vote. Janaki said she has two sons, and that she lost her husband many years ago. The condition of her family worsened after the death of her husband. Her two sons aged 20 and 19 are not enrolled in the voters list," he says.
 
 An illiterate Janaki could not send her children to pursue their higher education.
 
 They are staying in Farangipet, but have no door number for their dwelling or any identity cards.
 
 Janaki recalls that she cast her vote 25 years ago. Hence, I have sent the details of the family to the Election Commission through an email. Following this, I asked officials to visit their house," said Bangera.
 
 "I sent an email with details about Janaki to P S Vastrad, director of SVEEP. Following this, the district administration sent officials to meet Janaki," Bangera said.
