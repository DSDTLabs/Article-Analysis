JAIPUR: There are more than 2,000 driving schools in the city. However, expect for a few one, none have a proper training module on how to drive on highways, take a proper turn at blind spots and how to apply brakes on a  .

 A senior   police officer said, there is a need to frame some regulations for these driving schools and hold them responsible for untrained drivers who cause accidents. 
 
 “In European cities, a motor driving school imparts training on how to drive safely on city roads. However, in India, these schools have no such training facilities,” said the police officer.
 
 The police said, lack of driving sense among riders is a major cause of concern. “In Rajasthan, we have bikes, cars, buses, trucks and bullock carts driving on the same road. Therefore, it becomes very important for our drivers to learn the most basic traffic safety rules apart from driving the car,” police official said, adding that the city lacks proper motor running tracks.
 
 A regional transport office (RTO) official too admit that regulation on driving school is a must, but currently there is no framework to ensure that. “Making eight pattern while driving is an important task as it measures the skill of a driver and his ability to make a turn, and drive reverse without ramming into other vehicles, but many trainer themselves lack that skill,” added an official of transport department.
 
 The Centre’s figures stated that more than 1,40,000 people lost their lives in road accidents in 2016. “The same report also stated that 78% accidents took place due to avoidable fault of drivers. This means every second accident that is occurring on roads is avoidable,” added the official.
 
 The cops believe a sustained training course has become a need of the hour.
