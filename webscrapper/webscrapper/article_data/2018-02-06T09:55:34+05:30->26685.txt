VADODARA: The   over fee hike reached its peak after   in   filed a civil defamation suit of Rs 10 crore against 14 parents of the school who had formed an association to lead agitation against fee hike.

 The school alleged in the defamation plea that 14 parents formed an illegal association and used the name and address of the school without any authority. It further stated that they formed an unlawful association even as a parents-teachers association is already constituted. As per the regulations of the board, there cannot be any other associations in the school, it added.
 
 When the members had written to the   to recognize the association – Tejas Vidyalaya Vali Mandal – a reply was sent to them to refrain from using the name of the school. After getting the reply, the parents changed the name of the association to Tejas Vali Mandal and wrote to the director of the school to recognize the association which was also struck down.
 
 On January 19, the school wrote a mail to the parents to tender an unconditional apology for using the word ‘Tejas’ and released a statement to the media in connection with that and if they fail to do so, the school will take appropriate action. In response to the school’s mail, the parents said that they have not breached any law by using the name ‘Tejas’ as it can be name of any person, organization, trust or industry.
 
 Following the mail, the school filed the defamation suit in a local civil court. The suit will be heard by the court on February 12.
 
 “They have alleged that the name and address of the school has been wrongly used which is not true. The parents used to gather at   for meetings so that was the address being used. We will put up a strong case against them,” said parents’ advocate Kishore Pillai.
