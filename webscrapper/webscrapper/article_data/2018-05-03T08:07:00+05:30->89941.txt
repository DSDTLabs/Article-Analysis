 We shifted to Gurugram from Delhi’s Asiad village some 10 years ago after my superannuation from Indian Oil. Although we did miss Delhi, we quickly settled down in the green surrounding of Sushant Lok I. Gurugram was a green and quiet place, with adequate forest cover over the Aravalis.
 
 Today in spite of it being labelled as ‘Millennium City’, it has become a polluted, concrete jungle. Lakhs of trees have been indiscriminately cut over the years to make way for roads, markets, malls and condominiums.
 
 There is an immediate need to address two major sources — dust pollution and vehicular emission — of air pollution. The following points need to be addressed:
 
 
 
 
 There are a large number of dysfunctional traffic lights, causing traffic jams at many places and thus increasing pollution.
 
 Inadequate penetration of  
 
 A large number of taxis and autos are still diesel-run, which causes a spike in air pollution levels.
 
 
 
 Faulty power infrastructure leads to power outages even in most posh areas of the city. Residents are, therefore, forced to use diesel-powered   that add to pollution.
 
 
 
 
 Gurugram is a dusty city. One can see dust everywhere, be it in open grounds of Sector 29 or Gurgaon-Faridabad road, where construction debris is lying everywhere. The waste from demolition is lying even in residential colonies like Sushant Lok and DLF phases in open plots mostly belonging to  .
 
 Normally, the wind velocity helps in bringing down pollution levels, but in Gurugram that increases the concentration of particulate matter as dust is everywhere. Most roads are dug up for construction, including those by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Even government agencies like NHAI have been flouting the norms set out by the Supreme Court and   during construction. No barriers have ever been erected.
