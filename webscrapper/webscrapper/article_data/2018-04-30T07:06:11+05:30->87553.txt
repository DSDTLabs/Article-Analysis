KOLKATA: After a successful trial run, the much anticipated   buses will start plying in   on Tuesday.

 
 The   (Hidco) and Coal India have jointly procured the 32-seater electric buses to be used as public transport for the internal routes in New Town. The authorities are starting off with three such buses and will procure more based on the response from commuters.
 
 The buses have Electric Bus in the combination of white, green and blue written on their side glasses. They will be parked and charged at the charging station cum workshop behind Pride Hotel. If required, there are two more charging stations near   and   bus terminus.
 
 Those intending to board the buses will get to see the arrival timings at the designated passenger shelters set up on the inner lanes of New Town. According to plans, the buses will ply in two shifts — from 8am to noon and 4pm to 8pm. The timings would be extended depending on the response.
 
 One of the unique features of these buses is that they would not have conductors. Just when a passenger gets in trough the front door, they would have to punch a smart ticketing system to get a printed receipt. Then a lock at the entry will open to allow the passenger inside and take a seat. “Standing would not be allowed inside the bus,” said an official.
