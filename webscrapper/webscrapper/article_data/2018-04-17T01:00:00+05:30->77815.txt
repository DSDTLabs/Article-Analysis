MADURAI: Nearly three months after an intense dry spell, intermittent rains have now cooled the plains in the southern parts of the state, with Madurai particularly receiving a decent downpour that saw the water level in   dam move up by at least two feet.

 The dam water level had presented a cause for concern for farmers and the   as it dipped drastically because of a largely rainless season. As farmers dreaded potential crop losses with the main water bodies reducing to a trickle, the Madurai Corporation implemented a once-in-four-day water supply system to tide over the situation.
 
 As was forecast, the southern districts have received rain with Madurai recording 18mm of rain over the last two days put together. The city and the surrounding areas experienced heavy thunder showers on Saturday night causing muddy pools to come up in many parts. A majority of the interior roads turned slushy due to the rain.
 
 The Mullaperiyar dam water level, which was only 112.50ft until Friday, went up by 1.10ft the next day and moved up further touching the 114.20ft mark on Sunday. Though the inflow was marked 2,320 cusecs on Saturday, it came down to 1,721 on Sunday. The water level of Vaigai dam was up only marginally at 33.46ft on Sunday, with the inflow and outflow being 168 cusecs and outflow 48 respectively.
 
 While Madurai recorded 18mm of rainfall, Chittampatti saw the highest rainfall of 48mm in the last 24 hours, followed by   43.60mm. Periyar recorded 22mm rainfall, Thekkady 10.6mm, Manjalaru 24.12mm and Melur 14mm. Southern districts like Ramanathapuram, Dindigul, Virudhunagar and   experienced mild to heavy showers on Saturday.
