KOZHIKODE: The   project to restore   corridors in   has got a fresh lease of life with the state government issuing orders to go ahead with the long-delayed land acquisition process for the   corridor, which is considered key to mitigating human-wildlife conflict in the region.

 The corridor, once restored, would free up the critical migratory route of elephants from the North Wayanad forests to the Kottiyur Wildlife Sanctuary in Kannur district.
 
 The Centre had allotted Rs 2 crore in 2008 for restoring the corridor but the project had remained a non-starter in Wayanad district, unlike Kannur, where land acquisition was completed utilizing the Rs 2.5 crore allotted.
 
 Now, the revenue department additional chief secretary has written a letter to the Wayanad district collector directing him to ask the North Wayanad DFO to submit the required requisition under the new Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act.
 
 The North Wayanad forest officials who had earlier asked the government to expedite the project in view of the escalating human-animal conflict due to straying of elephants said that they would soon submit the requisition to the government to carry forward the project.
 
 In the first phase of the project, 73 families would be relocated from the corridor site at Periya which would free up 36 hectares of land for elephant movement. 
 
 In addition, the forest authorities have also proposed to rehabilitate an additional 28 families in the nearby Chapparam and 47 families in CRP Kunnu for enhancing connectivity in the corridor.
