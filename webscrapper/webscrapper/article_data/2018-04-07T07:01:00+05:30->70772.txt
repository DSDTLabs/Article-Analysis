 “We had a half-an-hour meeting with minister Jai Pratap Singh at the collectorate in Surajpur where we sought resolution on common pending issues concerning residents. These include upgrading the district to a police commissionerate with additional personnel to check crimes, recognition of RWAs, representation for FONRWA in Noida Authority board, separate maintenance division under Noida Authority, treatment of solid waste management, conversion of all property in Noida to freehold and quality drinking water. On February 1 also we had raised these issues with the minister when he had come to visit the district. But since no action was taken after that, we apprised him again on Thursday and urged for concrete steps,” said A N Dhawan, secretary general,   (FONRWA).
 
 “Minister Jai Pratap Singh noted our plea and assured to take up the matter with the state government,” added Dhawan.
 
 Singh also assured the federation that he will soon facilitate a meeting of RWAs with Authority CEO   to sort out the delay in   redress.
