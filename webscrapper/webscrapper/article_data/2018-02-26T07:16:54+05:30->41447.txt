KOLKATA: The   government has started a toll-free helpline — 104 — for patients to complain against doctors or medical staff for negligence, misconduct or refusal. The system is currently working on a trial basis for a fortnight and there are plans to use it as a health counselling helpline as well. The decision was taken after there was a series of complaints against government hospitals, two this week alone.

 Dr Kunal Saha of   (PBT), an NGO for patients, said: “Several serious complaints of medical negligence and violation of medical ethics by doctors in state hospitals are pending.   and health department should decide on the complaints within six months, but they linger. Making a new hotline is nothing but an eye wash. It can be a political gimmick to hoodwink hapless patients. Will the Bengal government actually act against delinquent medicos?”
 
 Ahealth official said that after dialling 104, one can lodge a complaint about the hospital staff and doctors and receive a complaint docket through SMS.
 
 The complaint, received by the call centre, will be forwarded to the health department and will be cross checked with the hospitals. Once satisfied, health officials will ask the complainant to submit their version so a formal probe can be started.
 
 Dr Nirmal Maji, Trinamool MLA and chairman, health standing committee, said this helpline will also dispense information about beds, ICUs, ventilators and availability of blood in hospitals soon.
