Since the fest was being organized off campus, the organizers took extra security measures to make sure everything was in order. But as the security team, comprising student volunteers, tackled contraband like alcohol and cigarettes, they were stumped by an unexpected suspect – condoms.  , a student who was part of the security team of the event, said, "We were extra careful and frisked everyone entering. Bags and even wallets were checked. We confiscated any item that could have been problematic, including plastic bottles, lighters and any alcoholic beverage, among other things." However, the security team was in a fix over what to do with   that they found with many students.

 The student volunteers with the security team admitted that they hadn’t drawn up any guidelines regarding contraceptives of any kind, but admitted that condoms were fairly popular with students as a sort of preparation for a ‘chance encounter’ during the fest. A member of the security team told us, “Many students carry them as they feel a fest is the best time for them to get lucky. Almost every tenth guy who passed through was carrying one or more. Hats off to their self-confidence, but the problem is that we can’t confiscate condoms even if we find them. Kehte hain humari privacy hai, how can you seize it?”
 
 A few students protested as to why carrying condoms was problematic at all. Rahul (name changed), an MBA student, said, “Most young students carry them around. It doesn’t mean we are out to assault someone at the fest. It’s silly that the volunteers are even asking why we are carrying them. Isn’t it self explanatory? Fest ka time hai, this is when everyone is out to enjoy.”
