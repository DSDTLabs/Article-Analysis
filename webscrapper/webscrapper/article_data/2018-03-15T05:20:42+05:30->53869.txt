 The government said setting up of the BOC replaces the Delhi-centric approach and turns the ministry’s attention to hitherto uncovered areas. The BOC, sources said, will also focus on building communication in regional languages and creating content to connect better with local populations. 
 
 The government also said it has created an online system of integrated media campaign that relies heavily on inputs by client ministries regarding their target audiences. “The online system will later graduate into an automated system of payment to news/TV agencies carrying advertisements, thereby reducing backlogs and ensuring timely payments,” a government statement said.
