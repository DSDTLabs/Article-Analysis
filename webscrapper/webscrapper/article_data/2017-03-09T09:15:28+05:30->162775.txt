HYDERABAD: A   here has directed a   to refund Rs 2.8 lakh and pay Rs 50,000 as   to a   for depriving him of a chance to  .

 Saber Bin Mahamood Bamas took Rs 6.83 lakh as loan from `Family Credit Limited' by hypothecating his car.The loan had to be repaid within 60 months in Rs 15,540 EMIs. “On October 27, 2015, without any prior notice, the firm seized the car and sold it. Bamas offered to pay the outstanding amount (Rs 2.57 lakh) and requested the firm to return the car.
 
 “However, the firm asked me to pay Rs 3.33 lakh as against Rs 2.57L. When I wanted to talk to them, they bluntly told me that my vehicle had already been sold,“ he added.
 
 Left with no option, Bamas approached the forum for justice. The defendant chose not to appear before the forum in spite of being issued several notices. The firm's indifferent attitude towards the legal system and the customer angered the forum which delivered an ex parte verdict indicting the financier. Hence after calculating the depreciation value of the vehicle at 40% the forum fixed the cost of the car at Rs 5.4 lakh as on the day it was sold. The forum told the defendant to refund Rs 2.8 lakh, the difference between the value of the car and the outstanding amount apart from a compensation of Rs 50,000 and also Rs 5,000 towards legal cost.“
