The box-office figures of the   starrer '
 ' directed by Dolly has failed to create any impact in setting new records or breaking the ones that are already there.

 The movie, which was given average ratings has went on to run for a period of week, thanks to the makers who backed out from releasing their pictures fearing competition. But, the movie settled for a little less than it was expected to mint at the box-office, owing to the craze that the film and combination carried.
 
  
 By the end of Thursday, the Shruti Haasan starrer movie stood out at Rs 49.85 crore (Rs 62.90 crore gross) from the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana regions. A remake of the Tamil film 'Veeram', the movie is about a respectable village personality played by Pawan Kalyan, who streamlines the issues of the village and is also a dotting brother to his rest of brothers. In return,  's brothers vouch for a suitable bride and that is where the game ensues.
 
 The movie easily managed to pass the weekend test and albeit expected to do a fantastic business, has only managed to earn Rs 36.25 crore (Rs 47.75 gross) that is a culmination of Friday's share of Rs 22.25 crore, Saturday's share of Rs 5.10 crore and Rs 8.90 crore on Sunday. Worlwide, the movie which was released in about 1500 theaters managed to realise Rs 70 crore within the weekend. 
 
 
  
 Only on Thursday, before Venkatesh's 'Guru' and Puri Jagan's 'Rogue' has hit the screens, the Pawan Kalyan starrer has scored Rs 2.90 crore with an occupancy that is not even 50 per cent.
