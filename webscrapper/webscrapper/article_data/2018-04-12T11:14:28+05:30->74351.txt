PANAJI: After years in limbo, tenders for the implementation of high-security registration plate ( ) scheme are being initiated by the state transport department.

 A tender will be floated for the lowest bidder to supply HSRP plates for vehicles in Goa. These have to be mandatorily fitted on two-wheelers, four-wheelers and commercial vehicles like auto-rickshaws,   and  . 
 
 The move follows a contempt case filed in the   against the state for the delay in implementing HSRP. The tender was cancelled on multiple occasions in the past causing the state to fall behind in the implementation of this Supreme Court order.
 
 “The case of contempt of court proceedings has been filed against nine states including Goa for not having complied. We have sent the file to the government to get the process started,” a department official said.
 
 Considering that there were 13.2 lakh motor vehicles registered in the state as of December 31 last year, and an average of 72,000 vehicles being registered every year, transport department officials are hastening to implement the process.
 
 Various parameters are being looked at like cost of material, type of material, following which they will sign an   with the lowest bidder. The selected bidder/s will have to visit the vehicle showroom and fix the device on new vehicles before they go on-road, sources said.
