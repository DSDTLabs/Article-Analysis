BENGALURU: God said, “Let there be cobalt blue, cadmium yellow and vermillion”. As you turn the pages of Hidden Truth, a memoir on illustrious painter Raja  , this line jumps at you. The book has been written by the artist’s great-granddaughter  .

 
 “So many biographieshave been written about him and anybody whois a studentof Ravi Varma’s works knows his life history well. The reason I decided to write the book is because I realised that nobody knew the man behind the artist, nobody knew the inner workings of his mind, of how he was able to paint the way he did, bringing gods and goddesses alive,” she says.
 
 
 
 
 Rukmini’s main source of content were the stories that her grandmother, the last Maharani of Travancore, Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, had narrated to her.
 
 “The personal aspect of Ravi Varma in the book is based on what I have learned about him from my grandmother who knew much about his personal experiences. Her mother Mahaprabha Thampuratty, Ravi Varma’s favourite daughter, kneweven more abouthim and was privy to his thoughts whichhe revealedtoher on many off-guard moments, talking about his inner agonies — personal and physical,” she noted.
 
 But even more crucial, Rukmini reveals, was two notebooks maintained by Ravi Varma that she chanced upon in the late 60s. “There was a property division at   (Ravi Varma’s birth place) and as everyone was busy taking away what they wanted, one of the family members noticed two old books lying discarded,” she said.
 
 They were The Best Works of theRoyalAcademyMasters. Dated sometime in early 1900s and publishedin London,these werebooksheconstantly referred to in his studies on composition and placement. The family member who found them was surprised to see the notes in Ravi Varma’s handwriting. Helentthebooksto mefor a week,” added Rukmini.
