HYDERABAD: It seems seamless commuting is not possible in the city even during night as some of the major thoroughfares are taken over by private travel buses. Areas such as  ,   Kukatpally, Nampally and   are places where the traffic is reduced to a snail’s pace as buses block the main roads.

 Heavy vehicles are allowed inside the city limits only between 10pm and 6am. While it is still possible to see several big Volvo buses coursing their way through the city in violation of the time deadline, most tour operators deploy mini buses and vans to ferry passengers from various pick-up points to the city outskirts. These buses end up clogging the roads at peak traffic hours.
 
 
 Commuters complain that mini buses occupy a major part of the road as many of them are parked on one side while awaiting passengers. This ends up eating into the available road space.
 
 “The traffic at Afzalgunj moves at a very slow pace compared to many other roads in the city due to these private buses. The drivers move their vehicles only after seeing a traffic policeman and in fear of penalty,” said  , an advocate.
 
 Similar grievances were aired by  , an architect from the city, who complained about the parked buses at Lakdikapul bridge.
 
 According to traffic police, these buses obstruct traffic mostly in the Cyberabad region. “The mini buses mostly enter the city after 8.30pm. We try to ensure that they are not parked on the road. Heavy footfall and the number of new vehicles hitting the road every day is the main reason for traffic moving at slower pace in many parts of the city,” said a top official from Hyderabad traffic police department.
 
 On the other side of the city, several commuters at LB Nagar said that buses are usually parked at the corner of the road till all seats are filled. “I saw a bus parked towards a corner of the road as the staffers tried to get customers. The vehicle moved only after all the seats were occupied,” said  , a businessman from the city.
