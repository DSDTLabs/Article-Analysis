PUNE: In order to ensure maximum   in the district, officials involved in   drive have written to the district deputy registrar of cooperative   to make certain that 100% residents staying in societies have Aadhaar cards. 

 With the district registering 90.47% enrolment, the officials plan to reach over 16,000 housing societies in Pune and   for maximum coverage.
 
 Samiksha Gokule, the nodal official coordinating the drive, said they have sent a letter to the cooperative department. “The registrar of societies will circulate it to over 16,000 housing societies. Chairmen and secretaries of housing societies will be asked to identify residents who do not have Aadhaar cards. Depending on the number of pending registrations, Aadhaar enrolment kits will be sent to the societies,’’ Gokule said.
 
 At a recent video conference held under the chief secretary it was revealed that Pune district was lagging behind in Aadhaar coverage. Hence, it was suggested by the chief secretary that ‘camps’ should be held at housing societies to increase the total number of registrations.
 
 The letter to the cooperative department states that it would have to first give details of the total number of societies, both registered and unregistered, to the nodal officer. The letter directs chairmen of housing societies to provide information on the number of people who are not holding Aadhaar cards. Phone numbers of these housing societies have been sought so that separate camps for enrolment can be held in these societies.
 
 Officials said the chief secretary has directed that the checks should be conducted on a door-to-door basis in every society. After the list is prepared, the department will send the enrolment kits in the next three months. The department presently has around 90 enrolment kits, which are kept at various anganwadis in the district.
