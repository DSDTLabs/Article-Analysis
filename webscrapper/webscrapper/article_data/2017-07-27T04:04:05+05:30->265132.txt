BAREILLY/MEERUT: A day after the   quashed the appointment of 1.78 lakh shiksha mitras in UP whose jobs as teachers were regularised in primary schools in 2014, there were protests across UP, some of which turned violent at a few places.

 Thousands of shiksha mitras took to the streets on Wednesday in Agra, Etawah, Farrukhabad, Mainpuri, Bijnor, Meerut,   and several other districts, claiming that the apex court had “signed their death warrant” and sought the government’s permission for mercy killing.
 
 In Bareilly, demonstrators turned violent, targeted commuters and vandalised vehicles. Heavy police force had to be rushed to the spot and district administration officials held parleys with demonstrators for hours before the road blockade could be lifted. In Pilibhit, hundreds of agitators blocked the   highway for hours.
 
 Hundreds of schools in Bareilly and Pilibhit were forced to close as more than 4,000 teachers boycotted work. Though shiksha mitras have decided not to go back to work, the basic education department said that they have no alternative arrangement at hundreds of such schools which are mainly manned by them. In Bijnor, shiksha mitras gathered at the BSA’s office, created ruckus and blocked the DelhiPauri national highway. The agitators also burnt an effigy of CM Yogi Adityanath.
