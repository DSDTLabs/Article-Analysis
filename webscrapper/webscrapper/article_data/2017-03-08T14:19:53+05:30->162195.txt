PATNA: The   (BSEB) will introduce four different sets of questions for Matric and Intermediate board examinations. The decision was taken at the meeting of the BSEB governing body here on Tuesday. Earlier, the board used to have only one set of question papers.
 
  BSEB chairman   said the changes would be implemented from this year’s compartmental exam. “The board will allot examination centres to the students randomly through a computerized system to ensure transparency,” he said.
  
  At least 14 persons were caught for impersonation at different Matric examination centres across the state on Tuesday. Altogether 14 examinees were expelled for using unfair means during the day.
  
  Kishore said overall 64 imposters were caught and 400 students expelled since the Matric exam began on March 1. The examinations were held at 1,167 centres in the state with over 7.63 lakh students writing papers.
  
  “The examination passed off peacefully and no untoward incident was reported from any centre in the state. The board has successfully conducted both the exams – Intermediate and Matriculation,” said Kishore.
  
  He added, “The bar coding of Intermediate copies has been completed while the Matriculation booklets will be barcoded by March 10. The evaluation of Intermediate and Matriculation copies will begin from March 15 and March 21, respectively. Students can expect early announcement of the results.”
  
  This year the board avoided digital marking system as it costs Rs 40 per copy. “The system will be introduced next year. For this, we will increase the rate of exam form of Class X and XII,” said Kishor.
