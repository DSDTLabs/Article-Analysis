NEW DELHI: A 50-year-old man was critically injured after being hit by a speeding Mercedes near   in south Delhi on Tuesday evening. A traffic policeman posted nearby and a few passersby tried to stop the car but the driver sped away towards Chanakyapuri after ramming an auto, eyewitnesses said. 

 The victim has been identified as Dasarath Yadav, who works at a nearby market. He was thrown a few feet up in the air and landed on his chest. Doctors at Safdarjung Hospital said he had suffered serious head injuries and fractured some ribs. His condition is said to be serious. 
 
 The occupants of the autorickshaw, too, were taken to the hospital but were discharged after treatment.
 
 Around 5.05pm, the car with the registration number UP 16 TC 1295 came at a high speed from the Vasant Vihar side and hit Yadav who was crossing the road, said ASI Shashi Bhushan who tried to stop the car. 
 
 The traffic on Ring Road is fairly heavy during this time but the vehicle was perhaps travelling at a speed of more than 100kmph, said sources. The police suspect that the driver was trying to get away after hitting a vehicle. 
 
 The police control room was informed by the traffic cops posted nearby. Bhushan also relayed a message on his wireless set about the fleeing vehicle, but the driver could not be caught. 
 
 The vehicle had a temporary number plate that was noted down by traffic cops. The police used it to identify the showroom in Noida that had issued the numberplate. 
 
 The police are yet to record Yadav’s statement. A case for negligent driving and causing hurt due to negligence has been registered against the driver.
 
 The police have informed Yadav’s family members about the accident.
