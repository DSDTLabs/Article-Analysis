Around 500 forest department staff and volunteers will be engaged in the tiger population estimation to be held at Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve ( ) from January 27. The study will go on till March 31, following which the compilation of the population will be released by Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun.

 KMTR field director (FD) N Venkatesh said the population estimation was last carried out here in 2014. He said the tiger reserve sprawling on 1,600sqkm, including an 895sqkm core area, has the capacity for 20 tigers. During the census conducted last year the department had confirmed that the tiger reserve was home to 15 tigers.
 
 Nearly 250 forest department employees have already been trained on the population estimations. The volunteers will be given training for a day before the commencement of the estimation. Each team will be provided with binoculars, cameras, GPS tracking to map the location, walkie-talkie, gun and machete to make their way into the thick forest. They will also be given paints to mark trees in the areas where another team has conducted the field study. The study will be conducted in four phases, beginning with the physical observation for pug marks, scratches on trees, kills and faeces.
 
 On completion of the same in the 50 beats in the forest by as many teams the department will install 500 camera traps on the routes where the big cats walk. Two camera traps will be set up in each path to capture the full view of the tiger. Traps will be used only for 25 days (usually 45 days) as parts of Kanyakumari (20,000 Ha) and   (3,500 Ha) forest divisions also have to be covered.
 
 "This time we will be recording details manually and in a mobile app. Manual recording is a backup if the gadgets failed without power as they walk into the forest for days together," the FD said and added that the areas to be covered include 21 hills that are more than 1,600 meter above the sea level.
