Visakhapatnam:   must be done on construction of   structures, eco-friendly structures and structures that allow soil conservation and liquefaction, said professor G Nageswara Rao, vice-chancellor of  . 

 Speaking at the inaugural address on ‘Research Facilities for Soil Liquefication, Fire Effective Structures and Coast Protection Structures’ at the department of civil engineering, the VC said gypsum, which is widely used in modern-day structures, changes its nature when a building catches fire. He advocated the cause of eco-friendly constructions, which would protect the coastal zone and the local ecology, apart from ensuring water catchment.
 
 “It is time for us to think green, so that we can go green,” said Nageswara Rao. 
 
 Professor CNV Satyanarayana Reddy of the department of civil engineering said the quality of structures is effected either through fire accidents or because of soil conditions. He said structures that take vast spaces without ensuring water seepage back into the soil also do not have a large shelf-life. Professor Reddy urged the students to conduct research on health and life span of structures and how to increase their durability.
