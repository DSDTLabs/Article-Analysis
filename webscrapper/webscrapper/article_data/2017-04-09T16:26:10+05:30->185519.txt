Veteran actor   says he was once mistaken for a drug dealer at a party because his British accent left listeners thinking he said "my cocaine" when introducing himself. 

  
  
 
 The 84-year-old   made the revelations on an upcoming episode of a popular chat show.
 "I was at a party in the Philippines and the hostess was looking at me rather nastily and finally she beckoned me over and said, 'Are you a drug dealer?' 
 
 "When I said, 'No, why do you ask?' She said 'Why is everyone calling you My Cocaine?' You know that story is true because you couldn't make it up," he said
