VADODARA: In a second case of attack on policemen, this time in Vadodara rural, a group of residents from   village assaulted the team of cops which tried to stop the vehicle of a bootlegger near   crossroads.

 A police sub-inspector had to fire three rounds in air in self-defence as when the mob gheraoed and assaulted him. According to police, B D  , police sub-inspector of Vadodara taluka police station, was checking vehicles near Ganpatpura villages during a routine drive late on Thursday evening. Meanwhile, an SUV car did not stop and drove past the check-post towards Ganpatpura. Police followed the car but after reaching some distance the coops were gheraoed by residents of Ganpatpura village, which is notorious for its bootlegging activities.
 
 Police officials said that the mob resorted to heavy stone pelting on the Bolero SUV of the police which was damaged in the attack. When the cops came out of their vehicle, they too were assaulted. 
 
 Jadeja then fired three rounds from his service revolver in self-defence to disperse the attackers. Extra police force from surrounding areas was called in after alerting the police control room.
 
 Jadeja and two police constables were injured in the attack and they were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. “The situation was brought under control quickly and we have initiated the process of registering the FIR against all those who were involved in the attack,” said  , superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural), who too rushed to the spot.
 
 Ganpatpura village is notorious for operations of illegal liquor dens and often police raid these dens and arrest the bootleggers. Local sources informed that few days ago, police had picked up a bootlegger from the village and had allegedly beaten him up. Thursday’s attack could possibly be to avenge this alleged thrashing.
