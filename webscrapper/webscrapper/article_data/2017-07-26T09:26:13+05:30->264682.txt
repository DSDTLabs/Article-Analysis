DEHRADUN: The Shishambara waste management plant, touted as a major step towards solving Dehradun’s waste management problems, might miss its deadline yet again.

 The project that was supposed to be completed by July 31 will take another month to be operational, claimed Dehradun nagar nigam officials.
 
 The plant, to be constructed under the   scheme was first approved in May 2008 and was supposed to be completed by December last year.
 
 “Although most of the work is complete, the components of the plant are being installed carefully and, hence, the delay. We are trying our best to ensure that at least we start the trial run by August 1,” said  , health officer, Dehradun nagar nigam. He added that the project is being constructed under the PPP model and the nigam has invested around Rs 22 crore and the private firm has put in Rs 14 crore.
 
 Anil Kumar, a resident said, “The nigam cannot extend the deadline so many times and give us false promises. We had been assured that the trenching ground will be shifted soon and they should stand by their word.”
