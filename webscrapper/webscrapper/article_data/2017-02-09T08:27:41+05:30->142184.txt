 “I planned a   long ago and the merger is part of it. It will help us have better accountability for manpower,“ she said on the floor of the House.

West Bengal Fisheries Develop ment Corporation will be merged with fisheries department, while West Bengal Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation and West Bengal Finance Corporation will be merged with the finance department.
