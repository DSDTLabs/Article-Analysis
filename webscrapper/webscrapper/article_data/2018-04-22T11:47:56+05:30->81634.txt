PANAJI: Goans for   Only, a voluntary organisation, on Saturday said that civil aviation minister   should disclose figures to back up his claim that the Dabolim airport will not be closed down for civilian flights once the   is commissioned.

 Convener   said that figures convey a totally different narrative, and expert reports by the   and the ADPI, a French airport firm, clearly state that one airport is the best solution for Goa. He pointed out the irony of Prabhuâ€™s plan to transport local produce of Goan families to international markets while the state government is urbanising Goa to such an extent that Goa has to import farm produce from neighbouring states for its own consumption.
