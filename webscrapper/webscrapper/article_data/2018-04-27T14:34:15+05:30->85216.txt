PATNA: Worried over road accident casualties, chief minister   has ordered construction of underpasses and foot overbridges with ramps and slopes on all new roads. 

 Sources said the CM issued the directives after a high-level committee on road safety submitted its report to him on Thursday. “Guidance, warning and regulation signs should also be used in accident-prone areas,” the CM said.   also asked officials to strictly adhere to the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 while issuing motor vehicle licences. He also ordered use of computer-based simulators for the purpose of issuance of driving licenses. 
 
 The CM underlined the need to use technology to automatically calculate the penalty for violation of traffic norms. He also pitched for the launch of a campaign to spread awareness about road safety among people residing in villages and habitations situated close to national and state highways. 
 
 While maintaining that the syllabus in schools should have at least one chapter on road safety, the CM also put stress on installation of speed governors on vehicles used by educational institutions to transport students.
 
 The state transport department has already set April as the deadline for installation of speed governors in all commercial vehicles.
