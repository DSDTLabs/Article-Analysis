Surat: City police on Saturday started a trial at Umra police station to deploy policemen on duty for eight hours only. The policemen will work in three shifts at this police station.

 The decision has been taken by city police commissioner Satish Sharma to improve efficiency and reduce stress on cops who work for several hours continuously at the police stations. The existing staff at Umra police station has been divided in three shifts of eight hour duty.
 
 “Policemen have to work for long hours and that affects their health and efficiency. This schedule also affects the overall quality of service. If a policeman is tired and stressed, you can’t expect proper behaviour from him,” Sharma said.
 
 “Hence, we are trying to limit the work hours of policemen and their duties will be distributed in a manner that they will get proper rest. The trial has started at Umra police station. We will examine the outcome and may implement this schedule in other police stations too,” Sharma added.
 
 Umra police station is being developed as a model police station in the city. Attempts are being made by senior police officials to improve performance of the staff here.
