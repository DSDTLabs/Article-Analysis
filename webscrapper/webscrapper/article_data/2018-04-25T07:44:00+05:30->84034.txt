Chandigarh: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday said decks had been cleared for the transfer of land to set up a   refurbishing and rehabilitation factory at Barhi near Gannaur in Sonipat.

 The factory, to be set up at a cost of about Rs 600 crore, would not only provide direct and indirect employment to thousands of youths, but would also offer opportunities of skill development. It would accelerate the pace of development and help set up various subsidiary units, including small and medium enterprises, the CM added.
 
 Khattar said Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) had cleared all technical barriers to set up the factory. HSIIDC would give 161.48 acres of land to the railways on a 99-year lease where about 500-700 rail coaches would be refurbished and rehabilitated.
 
 Both the HSIIDC and railways have agreed on all necessary points of the project, including the process of land transfer. Possession of this land would soon be given to the railways after which the construction work would start.
 
 All buildings under this project would be constructed as per the Haryana Building Code. In order to meet the water requirements, tubewells would be constructed as per governmentâ€™s policy, Khattar said.
