 The initial scenes of Enakku Vaaitha Adimaigal almost make you regret your decision of watching the film. They are loud, unfunny and agonizingly painful (Thambi Ramaiah, especially, is unbearable). And with Jai trying hard to recreate his comic persona from Raja Rani, things look bleak. Thankfully, once the focus shifts to the plight of the friends, we get a few laughs here and there to keep us amused. But then, the director isnâ€™t sure of how to resolve things and begins to introduce serious stuff like cold-blooded murder, imprisonment and life-threatening accident. And Rajendran turns up as Karuppu Rock, and tries hard to make us laugh. These only contribute to bloat and our patience starts to wear thin.
