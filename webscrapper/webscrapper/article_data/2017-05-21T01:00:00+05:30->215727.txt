PATNA: The murder of contractual revenue clerk   (61), who was shot inside the Islam Nagar circle office in   district on Thursday, was fallout of a decade-old rivalry between two families, police said on Saturday.

 SHO of Chandradeep police station Sanjay Kumar Biswas said   was a district board member of   from   block from 2001 to 2006. “The rivalry began in 2005 when one Shekhar Yadav of Mananiya Tari village under Kauwakol block in Nawada district lynched three persons over a land dispute. Later, Ambika and fellow villagers ransacked the residence of Shekhar,” the SHO said, adding the land dispute snowballed into a bloody war between the two families in which 10 persons from both sides have so far been killed.
 
 He said Ambika’s mother, sister and a nephew were murdered in 2006 while his son Tarun Yadav was shot dead in 2008. Shekhar was made named accused in all the murders. Later, Shekhar was also murdered in 2014 after he came out of jail on bail and Ambika and his associates were made named accused in the case.
 
 “The criminal, Upendra Prasad Yadav (29), who was lynched by the mob on Thursday, turned out to be Shekhar’s brother-in-law, who was co-accused in Tarun’s murder,” the SHO said, adding Upendra had fled to Surat in   after Tarun’s murder and returned a week back, perhaps only to kill Ambika.
