NEW DELHI: More than 400   and educationists from Delhi NCR participated in the   Principal’s   this year at The Oyster Beach in Gurgaon on Friday. 

 The meet was organised by  , a Times Group Division and Appu Ghar, Gurgaon. The meet started with a panel discussion on ‘Learning for success in a new world’ by Suneet Tuli, dean of the School of Engineering and Yaj Medury, vice chancellor of Bennett University. The panel emphasised on making students job-ready and empowering them with skills required to move up in career. 
 
 Nine principals also won gift vouchers sponsored by Kairali, Tybros Tours and Appu Ghar in a lucky draw. “It was a good platform for school leaders as principals are normally busy and perceived to be serious. We found a place to unwind and ideas transpired. I strongly recommend more such meets,” said Bhawna Babbar, manager,   School, Dwarka.
 
 The event was sponsored by Kairali, Clinic Dermatech, Johnny Rockets, Glam Studios and Tybros Tours.
