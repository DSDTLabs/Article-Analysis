New Delhi: The ownership issue of Yamuna Vihar’s Noor-e-illahi   on which AAP-led   government is constructing a   clinic was brought up in the standing committee meeting of East Delhi Municipal Corporation.

 Chairman of the standing committee, Jitender Chaudhary Jeetu, said that “we have already registered our strong opposition to the Delhi government’s action by filing an FIR with the police and now the civic body will lodge a case against them. The Delhi government can’t take over our properties without even taking a no-objection certificate from us”. The issue was brought because the closure of dhalao had led to heaps of garbage in the area.
