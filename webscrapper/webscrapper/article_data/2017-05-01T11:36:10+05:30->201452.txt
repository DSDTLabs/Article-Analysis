CHANDIGARH: The approach road to Kansal village is a strange one. In a spectacular display of  , a part of the road was raised for  . 

 The cycle track, however, was never completed. The result is an incomplete road that regularly trips commuters. 
 
 The icing on the cake? Defunct street lights, which turn the road into a death trap at night. With Kansal village having no other road to Chandigarh, residents continue to live in fear of the dangerous road. 
 
 The Chandigarh administration’s chief engineer,  , said the work has been stopped to explore ‘better ideas’ for repairing the road.
 “We had stopped the work on the cycle track on the Kansal road as we are exploring avenues to widen it,” he said. “The road is very narrow, and it can’t accommodate cycle tracks. Soon, we will float tenders for widening of the road and also for fixing the street lights.” 
 
 Kansal has a population of over 45,000, and all of them use this road, which bisects   and Chandigarh club. The road is particularly dangerous for children — most kids in the Kansal area study in various government schools in Chandigarh, mostly in Sectors 10 and 16, and travel daily by this road.” 
 
 A resident,  , told TOI that almost every single day, someone or the other from the village gets hurt after falling down on this badly-shaped road. Another local, Usha Rani, said, “A few days ago, I was riding back home after Sunset. An SUV came towards me. I couldn’t see the road’s elevation and hence fell of my scooter, sustaining bruises.”
