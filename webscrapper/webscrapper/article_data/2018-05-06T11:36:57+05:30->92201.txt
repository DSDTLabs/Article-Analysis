CHANDIGARH: The Department of Indian Theatre at Panjab   held a press conference to mark its annual play production in the department premises on Saturday. 

 The production will be staged from May 7 to 9 at 6:30pm in Studio Theatre 1, Panjab University.
 
 This year, the production from the theatre department has been directed by   Award winning director  . The play titled 'Beyond Smile' is a narrative produced only under twenty-eight days, according to Guha, who likes to refer to the 25-day cycle of exercise as 'production process'.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Guha said, "I never claim myself to be a playwright, instead, I develop a play with the help of my co-actors and activists. 'Beyond Smile' is our joint product. Right from the selection of theme, compositions, choreography, improvisations, costume, light, etc. all credit goes to the students," he said. 
 
 The narrative is primarily based on the atrocities of mass destruction prevailing in the society against a community and focuses largely on the Syrian crisis, followed by the plight of Rohingya muslims in   and then India. The play also focuses on issues of sexual violence, crimes against women and child rapes.
