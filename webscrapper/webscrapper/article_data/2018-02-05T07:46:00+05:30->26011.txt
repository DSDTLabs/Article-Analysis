CHANDIGARH: Three days after filing of the 80,000-page chargesheet into the alleged land acquisition scam of Manesar in Gurugram, former Haryana chief minister   Hooda on Sunday announced his ‘Jan Kranti Rath Yatra’ from   in   district later this month.

 “Naa to rath rukega aur na Hooda jhukega. Sachchai sab ke saamne aa jaayegi (Neither the chariot will stop nor will Hooda bow. Truth will come out before everyone),” Hooda said, while chairing a meeting of the   MLAs, former MLAs, MPs, ex-MPs, and senior leaders of the party at his residence in Delhi.
 
 Referring to the case, Hooda said this was nothing but a ploy of the NDA government in the Centre and the   government in the state. “Rajasthan was just a trailer and Haryana will show the real film to the BJP during the general and assembly elections,” said Hooda, adding that he respected the law of the land and would come out clean in all cases.
 
 Hooda said his march would start on February 25 from Hodal. “This yatra is targeted to restore brotherhood, prosperity and to announce fight against the BJP rule to bring change of guard in the state. The BJP always resorted to politics of lies and tried to use divisive and vindictive politics. This will not be tolerated now,” he said.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, his son and   MP   Hooda also flayed the BJP government in the Centre and Haryana. Referring to BJP president Amit Shah’s programme in the state, Deepender said he should start a camel yatra instead of the motorcycle expedition so that he could feel the pulse of electorate of Haryana.
