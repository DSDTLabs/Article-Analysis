 However, Vijayalakshmi, who was out on bail bought portable ultrasound machine and set up an airconditioned clinic behind her house. "We sent a four month pregnant as decoy. We recovered the cash of 77,990 from her cash box. The cash included 5,000 we sent to our decoy," said deputy superintendent of police A Thomas Prabhakaran. 
 
 She told the police she did not carry out any illegal abortions after the death of a woman in 2017. Villupuram subcollector, Charushri, joint director of health services, S Nehru were present during the decoy operation. "She tried to escape but we caught her on time.
