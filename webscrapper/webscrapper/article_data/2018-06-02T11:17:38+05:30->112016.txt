HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court has made it clear that members of a temple founder's family can seek a declaration from the authorities recognising them as founder family members even if the temple was built before the enactment of the Telangana Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Act, 1987. 

 Justice B Siva Sankara Rao pronounced this judgment recently in a case filed by Shashikala and four others who were opposing the claim of Babita Sharma, daughter of Mahant Ramchandra Das, the founder of Sri   near Charminar.
 
 Babita Sharma first approached the Endowments Tribunal seeking family member status and even produced a 'will' written by her father to substantiate her claims. She raised doubts about the claims made by her rivals, the kin of priest Raj Mohan Das, who was claiming inheritance on the grounds of adoption by the founder. She also challenged the decision of the endowments officials who accorded recognition to the kin of Raj Mohan Das in 1998.
 
 Shashikala and four other kin of Rajmohan Das told the court that the Act is not applicable in the current case as the temple was in existence prior to it. They claimed that the Endowments Tribunal can look into disputes pertaining to only temples that were established after enactment of the Act and sought dismissal of Babita's claims. When the tribunal held that the founder's daughter's petition merits a hearing, the priest's kin approached the high court challenging the tribunal order.
 
 Justice Siva Sankara Rao, in his order, said there is no bar for any legal heir of the founder of a temple or endowment institution to make a claim to act as a trustee and dismissed the plea of Shashikala and others. Since Babita's plea is held as maintainable, the Endowments Tribunal can now look into the merits of the case to decide who will be the rightful members of the temple founder family, he said.
