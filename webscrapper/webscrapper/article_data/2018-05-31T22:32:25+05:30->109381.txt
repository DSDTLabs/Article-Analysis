 Chauhan pinned him down and tried taking his phone back. While doing so, he grabbed Sandeep’s hair, which, he told the cops, he was very touchy about. Agitated, he stabbed Chauhan thrice in his abdomen, but even that did not deter him. Then he indiscriminately stabbed him on all parts of his body, until Chauhan collapsed unconscious.
