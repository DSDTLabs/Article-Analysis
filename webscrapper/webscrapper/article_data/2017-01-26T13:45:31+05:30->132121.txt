BAREILLY: Even though the region has managed to send two women ministers to the Centre, the participation of women candidates in the upcoming assembly elections seem abysmally low with only two names surfacing in the list of aspirants.
 
  Only two political parties have fielded a candidate each in the region even though there are 25 constituencies.
  
  The women cadre of Bareilly, Badaun, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur alleged that political parties are taking gender disparity to a new low by fielding only two candidates this year. As many as nine women candidates had received tickets from four political parties in the previous assembly elections.
  
  While   (SP) has fielded   from Powayan in Shahjahanpur, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has fielded Divya Gangwar from Bisalpur constituency. There are no women candidates from BJP in the region this year.
  
  BJP leader Tejashwari Singh, who was eyeing ticket from Meerganj constituency of Bareilly, told TOI, “Though senior party leaders always claim that women should be respected during public events, the reality is totally different. Maneka is a part of the cabinet only because she belongs to the influential Gandhi family. Krishna Raj was inducted in the cabinet last year as she is the Dalit face of the region. Though I have been working hard for 11 years for the welfare of people in my constituency, party high command has failed to take note.”
  
  On being asked why not even a single ticket has been given to women, BJP state general secretary   said, “The party always respects women and representation of women will be ensured in the next list of candidates.”
