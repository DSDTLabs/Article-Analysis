RAMPUR: In the eye of a storm for alleged irregularities in the construction of  , an institution owned by former UP minister and SP leader Azam Khan’s family-owned trust, Khan said he would blow up the institution using dynamite if anyone tries to take possession of it.

 Addressing a meeting of the Samajwadi Party workers at his party office at Topkhana Road on Sunday evening, Azam Khan said, “Those who wanted to see brooms in the hands of the minority children were shocked to see them getting quality education here. That’s why they have decided to close it. But I will rather blow it up using dynamite than giving it up.”
 
 State minorities minister and Bilaspur (Rampur) MLA Baldev Singh Aulakh had recently announced that he will be holding Janata Darbar (public grievance meetings) at the PWD guesthouse which is on the campus of the university. “The guesthouse is a government property and it will be used for people’s welfare,” he had said.
 
 On April 1, minister Siddharth Nath Singh had said that Azam Khan's role in the sale of property belonging to Waqf Board was being probed thoroughly. 
 
 Prominent Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad had also in the past accused Khan of selling Waqf property illegally. The SP leader, however, had denied the charges and called them "politically motivated".
