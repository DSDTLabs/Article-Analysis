 Ahmedabad: The 100th birth anniversary of Mrinalini Sarabhai, the classical Indian   who proudly put Ahmedabad on classical arts map, was celebrated by Google with a doodle. The doodle depicted her roots in Kerala and Gujarat through an umbrella and her attire as the background presented an amphitheatre with Bharatnatyam students, recalling her role as as founder of Darpana Academy of Performing Arts.
 
 Affectionately called ‘Amma’ by her disciples, Sarabhai was recipient of innumerable national and international honours including Padma Bhushan for her contribution to the field of Indian classical dance. Through dance performances choreographed by her, she also addressed a number of social issues. She passed away in Ahmedabad at the age of 97 years. 
 
 “We will be celebrating this landmark with a major event which will coincide with opening of the renovated amphitheatre soon,” said a Darpana spokesperson.
