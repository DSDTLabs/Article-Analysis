Nagpur: India is the country whose culture establishes its superiority over other nations, said union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday. Gadkari was speaking as the chief guest at a programme organized by Sai Kripa Sansthan, Kushi Nagar, to celebrate the 18th foundation day of Shirdi Sai temple. 

 Shirdi Sai Global Foundation is a public charitable trust registered in 2010. Since its inception, the foundation has been undertaking various activities pertaining to philanthropy, community development, spiritualism and promotion of Indian culture. 
 
 Chandra Bhanu Satpathy, a noted spiritual thinker, writer and philanthropist, was the guest of the evening. Gadkari praised the work done by Satpathy to spread the works of Sai Baba across the globe. “Satpathy has been spreading the teachings and philosophy of Shirdi Sai and Indian culture assiduously over a span of 25 years, not only in India but in other countries as well,” he added.
 
 Satpathy said, “We all are united and should make efforts to make some positive development. Time has come when we need to stop thinking that temples are only for worshipping god. Now, they should be modernized in such a way to provide help to the needy ones,” he added.
 
 Talking to TOI, president of the organization Narender Hemrajani said the motto was to promote the teachings and follow the path of spiritualism shown by Sai Baba.
 
 “Inspired by Satpathy, more than 200 centres and forums devoted to philanthropy, community development, spiritualism and promotion of Indian culture are active in countries like India, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other places, including some in the European countries.”
