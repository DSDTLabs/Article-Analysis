HYDERABAD: On the second anniversary of the Alair encounter in which five under-trial prisoners were killed, the victims' family members and lawyers reiterated their demand for a CBI probe. 

 In the encounter on April 7, 2015, Viqaruddin Ahmed, who was alleged to have murdered police personnel, and four others were killed while being moved from Warangal central prison to the city. Family members had questioned the cops' move to lodge the men 150 km away from the city at a National Human Rights Commission hearing in the same year.
 
 Viqaruddin's father Mohammed Ahmed said that from the day of the encounter they had been demanding a CBI probe. "We have no faith in police investigation being done here," he told TOI, adding that there has been no FIR. 
 
 He said that the special investigation team (SIT) to probe the encounter is yet to submit its report. "It has been two years. The investigation could have been completed and the report submitted long ago. This is why we have no faith in the SIT and want a CBI probe," he said. 
 
 Lawyer Gulam Rabbani said that his writ petition seeking exhumation of the bodies for re-postmortem was dismissed by the court. However, like Ahmed, he too said that neither an FIR was registered nor the cops were booked under IPC Sections 302 (murder). "This is according to the guidelines of the apex court which should have been done," he said.
