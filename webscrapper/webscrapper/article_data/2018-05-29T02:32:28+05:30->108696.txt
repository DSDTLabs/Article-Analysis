MUMBAI: The   ( ) will announce the   for Class X exams at 4pm Tuesday. 

 More than 16.3 lakh students across the country appeared for the examinations. After a long time, this is the first year that students did not have a chance to appear for the school based examination. 
 
 While not very popular in Mumbai schools, almost 50% of the students across the country opted for the school based examination. Like the class XII examinations, the class X exams were also marred with paper leaks. Several students from the city had petitioned the board to not conduct the mathematics re-exam. The re-exam was finally held only for students in the Delhi region. 
 
 The board has started a post-result counselling for students and parents in distress because of the results or with queries regarding results. The free tele-counselling service for parents and students will have on board 69 expert volunteers, including principals, trained counsellors, and special educators from CBSE-affiliated schools and psychologists.
