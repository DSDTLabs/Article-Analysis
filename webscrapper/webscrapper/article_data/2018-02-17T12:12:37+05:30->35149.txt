DHARWAD: Actor   visited ‘Soujanya’, the residence of M M Kalburgi at Kalyan Nagar in Dharwad on Friday and spoke for more than 30 minutes with the family members of the slain research scholar.

 Speaking to mediapersons on the occasion, Rai said that Kalburgi’s death is an irreparable loss to   literary and research field. The government should make sincere efforts to nab the assailants. Bullets cannot silence the voice of progressive writers. The more such incidents take place, the shriller the voices grow. Kalburgi’s murder had evoked response from across the country and this should tun into a movement. The fight for justice will continue, said Rai.
 
 Some vested interests are trying to set a bad trend of silencing those questioning the pseudo-secularism. However, the society is enlightened and will give a bitter reply to them in the future, he added.
 
 He further said that Umadevi, wife of prof Kalburgi, has said that the hearing at the   on   murder is slated to be held on February 23. Based on the outcome of the verdict future course of action will be decided, he said.
