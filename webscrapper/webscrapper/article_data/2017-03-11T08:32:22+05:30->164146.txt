GHAZIABAD: Family members of a 21-year-old autorickshaw driver who died after he was assaulted by six men on March 5, staged a protest at   Colony on Friday.

 The family members of the victim,   of Khoda, raised slogans and demanded the arrest of Pawan Yadav, the prime accused who is still at large. However, three other accused, identified as Bhuri, Karan and Sanjay who are all in their early twenties, were arrested on Thursday night, while two others, Pawan Gupta and Yasin, had been held on Friday.
 
 “This is a simple case of low tolerance. Boys these days have no control over their anger. Look at what have they done now, they will all have to go to jail,” said Jai Prakash Chaubey, SHO, Khora police station.
 
 According to police, Rizwan was going back home through a narrow lane in Khoda on March 5 around 9.30 pm when his bike accidentally collided with Pawan Yadav’s bike leading to a fight. “These boys called their friends to help them in their altercation. Pawan attacked Rizwan with a brick on his head, causing him to lose a lot of blood. He even kicked his face many times, resulting in grievous injuries,” said Chaubey.
 
 The accused then fled. An eyewitness rushed Rizwan to a private hospital in Khora Colony, following which he was referred to GTB Hospital in Delhi. After receiving treatment for almost five days, the victim passed away on Thursday night.
