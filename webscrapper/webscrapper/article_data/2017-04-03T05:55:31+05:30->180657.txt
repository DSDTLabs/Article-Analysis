RAJKOT: When six-year-old Rohan was found dead on the terrace of his house on March 20, neither his parents nor other family members in the joint family ever imagined that one among them had actually killed him.

 A fortnight on, the police arrested Rohan’s uncle   (41) on Sunday for the crime. Makwana confessed to smothering the child to death. What surprised the cops was the reason he gave for committing the gruesome crime. 
 
 Makwana told police that he had decided to kill Rohan to generate sympathy among his relatives whom he had to repay Rs 3.5 lakh. 
 
 “Rohan was Makwana’s younger brother Falgun’s only son. Makwana had borrowed Rs 3.5 lakh from several relatives and they were asking him to repay. He thought of creating sympathy by killing his own nephew,” said  , in-charge police inspector,  . 
 
 Makwana is a truck driver while Falgun is engaged in making aquariums. The brothers stay in the same house with their parents, wives and children. Makwana also has a son and a daughter. 
 
 “Makwana lives on the ground floor of the two-storey house. On March 20, Falgun was not at home and other members were on the ground floor. He took Rohan to the terrace on the pretext of feeding animals and smothered him to death,” said Solanki. 
 
 The family lives in Purnima Society on Nana Mava Road.
 
 Police got suspicious on the same day as they were informed that no outsider had gone on the terrace. They started questioning the family members but Makwana broke down during interrogation on Saturday night and confessed to killing the boy.
