CHANDIGARH: There is hectic lobbying for the Congress ticket for the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha byelection on October 11, according to sources in the party.

 Though no leader has announced to be in race for the ticket, sources in the party said leaders had already started to hold informal meetings. Sources said Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar may have to reluctantly take the plunge with his name being vociferously proposed by local leaders. Another section of leaders aligned with Rajya Sabha MP   are rooting for his wife and former   from Qadian, Charanjit Kaur Bajwa.
 
 Party leaders are of the view that nominating Jakhar will put an end to factionalism. At the same time, it is believed that Charanjit was promised a ticket for the 2019 Lok Sabha election as part of the patch-up between chief minister Captain   and   ahead of the assembly elections. “Mrs   sacrificed her nomination in the assembly election as part of the one-family, one-ticket policy of the party. She must have been waiting for the general election to make a comeback till now until this bypoll was necessitated,” said a party leader.
 
 A formal decision on recommending a name to the high command will be taken after Amarinder’s return from the UK on Thursday. “The party has been holding informal meetings so far. Till now, it is Jakhar’s name that has been recommended by local cadres,” another leader said.
