Navi Mumbai: A two-judge   bench on Tuesday dismissed the special leave petition filed in 2013 by Santosh Tandel of the Bavkhaleshwar Mandir Trust for maintaining status quo on the   MIDC property. 

 Tandel is former NCP state minister Ganesh Naik’s nephew.
 
 Activists who were opposed to the encroachments on the government land in Pawane and the now demolished   site covering 5,600 sq m area at  , have welcomed the SC verdict.
 
 RTI activist Sandeep Thakur told TOI: “By dismissing the SLP, the SC bench has upheld the 2013 Bombay high court order. Over 1.45 lakh sq m of   at Pawane has been freed of the encroachment by the Bavkhaleshwar Mandir Trust. This land should now be put to good public use by MIDC.”
 
 In 2013, Thakur had filed a PIL against Ganesh Naik, Bavkhaleshwar Mandir Trust and others for encroaching on Cidco property at Belapur (Glass House) and on MIDC land at Pawane. 
 
 “We have not yet received the SC order on the SLP on Bavkhaleshwar temple encroaching on MIDC land. But, if the SC order is in favour of MIDC, we will immediately seal the property,” said Avinash Mali, MIDC deputy engineer at Mhape. “MIDC has already taken custody of the area surrounding the temple, we will only have to evacuate the 1,000 sq m temple and take possession.”
 
 Former Thane MP Sanjeev Naik, elder son of Ganesh Naik, told TOI, “MIDC authorities had given permission to perform religious rituals and offer prayers at Bavkhaleshwar temple. I need to ascertain whether the SC has passed an order enabling MIDC to seal the temple and take possession of the land.”
