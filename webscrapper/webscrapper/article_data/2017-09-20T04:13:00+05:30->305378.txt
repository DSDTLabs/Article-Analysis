Patna: In what should send alarm bells ringing in the state capital, the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Tuesday reported 27 dengue cases, including 18 cases in the city.

 Sources said PMCH this month received as many as 79 suspected cases, of which 27 tested positive. According to the State Health Society Bihar, the state reported 75 positive dengue cases in August. Of them, 14 patients were from Patna.
 
 PMCH’s Microbiology HoD Dr Umesh Sharma said the remaining nine dengue patients this month belonged to Rohtas, Aurangabad, Gopalganj, West Champaran, Vaishali, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Nalanda districts.
 
 The sources said the PMCH also received 25 suspected cases of chikungunya this month. Three of them tested positive with two such patients belonging to Patna. 
 
 “We also had seven suspected cases of Japanese Encephalitis this month. One of them tested positive,” said Dr Sharma.
 
 The doctor advised people to protect themselves from mosquito bites. “Wear body-covering clothes, use mosquito net and ointment and do not let water accumulate anywhere near human habitation,” Dr Sharma said and added the PMCH would alert the municipal bodies with a request to conduct fogging.
 
 State epidemiologist Dr Ragini Mishra claimed the State Health Society Bihar has taken several measures to prevent further cases of vector-borne disease in places from where positive cases have been reported.
 
 “In rural areas, the administration conducts fogging. In urban areas, we provide a list of affected areas to the civic body which conducts fogging. We also ensure the availability of blood platelets in the hospitals,” Dr Mishra said.
