INDORE: The Indore branch of   ( ) leveled allegations against the chief medical and health officer that he was unnecessarily delaying taking action against medical practitioners that flouted rules while operating their clinics or hospitals.

 “Despite having all rights, CMHO Dr HN Nayak shows no interest in initiating action against these medical practitioners who flouted rules, further endangering the lives of many,” said IMA president  .
 
 A list of over 200 such doctors, who practice in and around the city, was handed over to the CMHO a couple of months ago, he added.
 
 “The senior health officer has a responsibility to protect the people from such medical practitioners, which is why he has been assigned all rights to take appropriate action, including filing of an FIR in the matter, but nothing has been done,” said Londhe.
 
 However, Dr Nayal said he has already asked a concerned official to register an FIR against the errant doctors. “I have asked medical officer Dr  , who was also a part of the inspection drive, to register an FIR in the case. The process will be completed in the next couple of days” said Dr Nayak.
 
 On March 23, a team of 25 officials led by sub-divisional magistrate (SDM)   carried out an inspection of clinics and hospitals in   and Musakhedi area.
 
 On the basis of the inspection report, district collector P Narahari last Monday issued orders to register an FIR against seven medical practitioners.
 
 Instructions were also given to issue notices to nine others to comply by the norms or their registrations will be cancelled.
 
 The local branch of IMA said it will approach senior administrative officials again with their demands.
