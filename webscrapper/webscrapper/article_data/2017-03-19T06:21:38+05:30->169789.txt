THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The special investigation team probing the alleged suicide of 10-year-old girl after being sexually abused at Kundara in Kollam, on Saturday filed an application before the district sessions court seeking permission to conduct polygraph test on the child’s mother and grandfather. The court has served a notice to the duo to appear on Monday in this regard. 

 The police moved for the polygraph test after their efforts to unravel the mystery through conventional interrogation ended in vain. Though the girl’s father and grandfather are the prime suspects, the former has the advantage of doubt as he was living separately from the family. Both the mother and grandfather have been giving contradictory statements during the interrogation. 
 
 In another related development, it became almost clear that the death was indeed a case of suicide. According to sources in the department, the suicide note recovered from the girl turned out to be genuine following an examination conducted in Forensic Science Laboratory in  . 
 
 Meanwhile, a fresh controversy has rocked the probe team on Saturday after there were reports that Kottarakarra DSP leading the team also committed dereliction of duty. The controversy is that despite being alerted by the state intelligence officials on March 7 for a detailed probe into the girl’s death, the SIT was formed only on March 14. 
 
 Kollam Rural SP S Surendran said that there was a delay from the part of the DSP in filing a Grave Crime Report, which is needed in such cases. However, the DSP’s argument is that the delay occurred as the Circle Inspector and Sub Inspector did not file their reports on time. The CI and SI were placed under suspension by the Range IG earlier.
