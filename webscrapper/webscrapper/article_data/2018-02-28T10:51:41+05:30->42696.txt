COIMBATORE: To add flavour to the festival of colours, city residents have come up with innovative dry pichkaris (pumps) and other gadgets.

  Khathuria, partner, Bombay Novelty stores, said they have introduced a colour shooter which uses organic colours extracted from vegetables for the first time in the city. “This colour can be easily wiped off with a cloth,” he said.
 
 Dheeraj had been collaborating with a Chattisgarh-based company that manufactured the pumps. “These innovative pumps are famous in the European market and we wanted to bring them to the city,” he said.
 
 More than 140 such pumps have already been sold with the city preparing for the   on March 1. This shooter can store 500gm of organic powder and can be refilled. “At least 25 shots can be made with a pump,” Dheeraj said.
 
 Another new product is the Holi popper. “Just like party popper, the Holi popper is filled with colours,” said  , a resident. She also plans to celebrate flower Holi exclusively with her friends in her apartment. “In spaces where we cannot use colours, we plan to use flowers to play the festival,” she said.
 
 Besides these, spiral pichkaris, water bags and water balloon packets are also in high demand. “Water bags are extremely innovative as three litres of water can be used for refilling the pumps,” said a resident.
 
 Organic colours extracted from turmeric, beetroot and spinach are also avilable in the stores.
