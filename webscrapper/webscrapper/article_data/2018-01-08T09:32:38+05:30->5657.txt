INDORE: Driver of the ill-fated school bus was responsible for the accident, claimed a technical report by the transport department on Sunday. 

 Sources at transport department said that the report was prepared by a six-member team of   - a joint venture between the   and   after inspection of accident site and vehicle. It was found in the report that the incident did not happen because of the vehicle's steering failure. The vehicle's steering wheel, steering column, steering yoke, gearbox mounting bolts were found intact while only the drag link is broken at the steering gear box end, which seems to be due to the accident impact.
 
 "From our observations, it does not seem that the steering system failed prior to the accident," stated the team in its report - a copy of which is with TOI. Explaining the possible reasons of vehicle riding on divider, the team pointed out that it appears that the driver may have lost his attention or attempted to save other vehicle/object by sudden steering. "He got jolted on his seat hence could not apply brakes," added the team.
 
 The report also pointed 'high speed' as one of the reasons for the accident being so fatal. "Looking at the damage/impact on the vehicle, it seems that collision has taken place at very high speed, but these facts could not be concluded as speed monitor and other devices were removed from the vehicle for investigation purpose," stated the report.
 
 The team also observed that the driver could not apply brakes as no tyre marks were visible on accident site and on divider. It however could not comment on the condition of braking system as the vehicle's air brake system is damaged due to collapse of the vehicle's frontal area and dislocation of its front axle.
