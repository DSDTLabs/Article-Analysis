PATNA: The approach road from Bailey Road to   railway station in the city is set to get a facelift as state’s road construction department (RCD) on Friday allocated Rs10.49 crore for it.

 Total 11 projects worth Rs167.38 crore were approved by road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav in a meeting held on Friday. The projects are spread over Patna, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Motihari, Aurangabad and several other districts.
 
 The   approach road will be repaired and widened along with development of amenities, including cross drain and other civic utilities over a period of 10 months. Movement of trains started from Patliputra   in December 2015.
 
 Located around 12km northwest of Patna Junction, Patliputra Junction is the third major railway terminal in the state capital. It is, in fact, the only railway station linking Patna with north   through the Digha-Sonepur rail-cum-road bridge.
 
 Sources said the state government was mulling to extend the existing approach road to Patliputra Junction up to Digha Thana. The existing approach road is likely to be made 4-lane up to Digha Thana.
 
 Patna apart, funds to the tune of Rs77 crore were allocated for four projects at Motihari and Rs12 crore for two projects in Darbhanga. The projects in Motihari include repair of Zero Mile road from Areraj to Dariapur and construction of 19.775km road from Parshurampur to  . Similarly, Rs4.79 crore was sanctioned for construction of a small bridge near Hariharnath Temple in Saran district.
 
 The minister said all projects would be executed between 6 and 24 months. “Out of the total Rs167.38 crore allocated for various projects, Rs22.71 crore was sanctioned on Friday. Officials have been instructed to ensure quality in execution and complete all projects within the set time frame,” Yadav said.
