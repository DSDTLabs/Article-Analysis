NOIDA: Two top executives of the  ,  , who were arrested by the   administration, were released on Tuesday after the realtor paid Rs 4.29 crore to the administration. CEO Rithik Sinha and director Nishant Mukul had been remanded in judicial custody on Monday after the firm failed to pay an   of Rs 4 crore for the last three years.

 Speaking to TOI, district magistrate B N Singh said, “Our demand for Rs 4.29 crore of outstanding labour cess has been met. The defaulters were taken into custody according to the provisions of law. However, after they cleared their dues by submitting demand drafts at the tehsil they were released from the Dadri lock-up on Tuesday evening. Their office premises, which had been sealed, were reopened on Tuesday. We had to resort to the extreme step as our frequent demands to clear dues were not being heeded. We will not shy away from repeating the action against other defaulters.”
 
 Deputy labour commissioner B K Rai reiterated, “We have issued recovery notices to seven other builders in the district who owe the government nearly Rs 10 crore. No one will be spared. We will take stringent action against those who are not paying the labour cess.”
 
 Despite repeated attempts, Amrapali officials could not be contacted.
 
 Both realtors and individuals, who spend over Rs 10 lakh on construction, come under the ambit of labour cess. It is mandatory to pay 1% of the total cost of the construction to the labour department as labour cess. In line with the central legislation, the Building and the Other Construction Workers Cess Act, 1996, the state government collects this levy to fund welfare schemes for construction labourers.
