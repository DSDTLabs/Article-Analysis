JAIPUR: Three days after a 38-year-old Dalit constable committed suicide in   district with his wife and two children, the assistant sub-inspector (ASI) who was accused of harassing the deceased in a six-year-old theft case, remains off the hook. 

 Searches are conducted to arrest  , who went into hiding soon after Gena Ram committed suicide with his wife Santosh (35), daughter Sumita (20) and son Ganpat (21). In a six-page suicide note, Gena Ram said, his family was made to suffer terrible mental agony after Radhakishan accused them of stealing valuables from his quarter at police line in 2012.
 
 Nagaur superintendent of police Paris Deshmukh said that a case was registered against ASI Radhakishan, Bhanwaru Khan and head constable Ratan Ram. "Radhakishan was suspended from the police services immediately after the incident came to light. But he fled upon learning about his involvement," he said.
 
 According to police, the deceased in his suicide note had alleged that he and Radhakishan were good friends, but in 2012, ASI Kishan filed a case of theft against Ram and his family. A final report was also filed by the police in this case, but Kishan kept challenging it in different courts.
 
 "ASI Radhakishan had challenged final report in a court and got the case reopened, a summon was issued to Gena Ram and his son which plunged the family into depression," said an official, adding that Ram in his letter alleged that he was needlessly harassed in the case by ASI Radhakishan, Bhanwaru Khan and head constable Ratan Ram. Gena Ram alleged that Khan was the investigation officer in the case and had been demanding money from him.
 
 Several Dalit right groups have been demanding immediate arrest of the guilty cop and proper investigation into Gena Ram's suicide. Ram and his family were found hanging in their house at Bagrasar village in Nagaur on Sunday morning. The deceased reportedly sent the image of the letter to a relative through What's app.
