She also wanted to know why Saherunnisa did not attended the recording of statements on Sunday.
 
 Begum further said they do not want another innocent to be framed even if the real culprits escape punishment. “Everyone knows who the perpetrators of the crime are.

 It may be noted that Ayesha’s parents have been accusing the hostel about her involvement in the case, further stating that the warden has critical details of the murder. They have been alleging that  , the grandson of Koneru Rangarao, was involved and to save him the entire case was twisted and police framed P   in the case.
