Madurai: The commission inquiring into the Madurai Kamaraj University scandal, in which assistant professor Nirmala Devi had allegedly lured students of her college to indulge in sex for educational prospects, has concluded the first phase of its inquiry with a sitting at the university. Retired IAS officer R Santhanam and two members of the commission had a meeting with registrar of the Madurai Kamaraj University Dr K Chinnaiah for more than two hours at the university. Later in the evening, around 4 pm, fourteen persons including the faculty members and two people from Aruppukottai submitted petitions to the commission. Santhanam said that they would be back on April 25 and may question Nirmala Devi the next day after her custody period is over. Sources said that documents regarding Nirmala Deviâ€™s presence in the university on February 13, 14 and 15, when she had reportedly come to the university in connection with paper correction work, were handed over to the commission. Higher officials of the university also appeared before the commission. Meanwhile, the CB-CID, which is investigating into the case, has conducted a search at the house of Nirmala Devi in Aruppukottai. Nirmala Devi underwent a health check-up on Saturday. The CB-CID personnel also made enquiries in various departments of the university and visited some of them at Palkalai Nagar. The investigating team is said to be looking for people who Nirmala Devi had mentioned during the course of enquiry. Attendance registers were also being inspected to see if anyone had gone on leave or was absent after the scandal came to light.
