The first complete trailer for Marvel's " " is yet to release but actress   already wants a second season.
 
  Ritter, 35, has been enthusing about the Netflix team-up series and hopes it's not the last we'll see of her Jessica Jones in a team, reported Entertainment Weekly.
  
  "With Jessica Jones, I'm in almost every frame of the show. This is spread out so we're all working about three days a week. We're all in celebration of that. It's honestly kind of a dream job," she joked.
  
  "If they want to do a Defenders 2, I'm in."
  
  Ritter is still shooting on the series, which she says has been a "blast" to film as she gets to watch all of the other Marvel Netflix stars strut their stuff.
  
  "It's fun to see their work, how they work, what their style is, what the integrity of their characters are," she said.
  
  "We're all so invested in our characters that everybody just wants everything to be great."
  
  "The Defenders" will see Jessica Jones team up with Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) to take on Sigourney Weaver's villain in New York City.
