Tigmanshu Dhulia’s upcoming film on the   saw a lot of its shooting taking place in Doon late last year. The crew shot around   and in the cantt area, to recreate the India of the 1930s and ‘40s. Mohit Marwah, who plays Colonel Prem Sehgal in the film, credits the city for helping him getting into the skin of his character. He says, "We shot parts of the film in Dehradun and that city really helped me get into my character’s skin. First of all, you are totally cut off from busy lives of bigger cities like Delhi and Mumbai. The pace of life in that city helped me to recreate mindset of 1930s/1940s, so I will give a lot of credit to Dehradun as a city for what I have created on screen. The Indian Military Academy is at Doon and at the locations we shot the film, you get to see these Army men on streets. So the atmosphere that you see around you, took me closer to where I needed to be."
