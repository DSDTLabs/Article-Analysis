 World’s largest two‐wheeler manufacturer, Hero MotoCorp Ltd (HMCL), has continued to further consolidate its domestic market leadership in India with an all‐time high sales for the month of May. The company despatched 706,365 units of two-wheelers (motorcycles and scooters) in May 2018, registering a growth of 11 per cent over the corresponding month in the previous fiscal (May 2017) when Hero had sold 633,884 units.  This is the third month of landmark seven lakh‐plus sales by Hero MotoCorp in recent times, with the two previous months being March 2018 (730,473 units) and September 2017 (720,739 units).  This year, Hero MotoCorp showcased its new offering in the premium segment, the Xtreme 200R, which is slated for launch in the second quarter of this fiscal. While the company has a strong portfolio in the commuter two-wheeler segment with around 18 products in the portfolio. But its sole product in the premium segment (Karizma ZMR), which is listed on the company website, has been almost obsoleted from the market. With the upcoming Xtreme 200R the company will try to make a comeback in the premium/sports segment.
