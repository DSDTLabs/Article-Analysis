CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress has “permanently expelled” nine more of its rebels, including former MLA Tarlochan Singh Soondh, from the party’s primary membership after they failed to toe the party line and withdraw from the assembly elections as independents.

 With the move, the party has so far expelled 16 party leaders who had contested as independent candidates. Apart from Soondh, the other eight rebels who have been expelled include Naresh Puri, Jasbir Singh Pal, Maninder Pal Singh Palasour, Avtar Singh Billa, Sukhraj Singh Natt,   Sidhu, Rajinder Kaur Meemsa, and  .
 
 An order signed by Punjab Congress president Captain   said they had been “expelled permanently from the primary membership of the party for anti-party activities with immediate effect”.
 
 The latest expulsion order comes 48 hours after a similar order expelled seven rebel candidates for life after they failed to retire in favour of the official Congress nominees even after the deadline given by Amarinder had expired.
 
 The party had on Sunday issued a final ultimatum to the rebel candidates who continued to defy the party diktat to withdraw their candidature or retire from the poll fray. The rebels were given time till 5 pm on Tuesday to step down in favour of the Congress candidates in their respective constituencies.
 
 Amarinder said it was important to send out a strong message that the party would not tolerate such rebellion and those going against the high command’s decision would have to pay for it. He reiterated that the candidates selected for tickets by the party leadership were chosen for their winnability and those who had withdrawn in favour of the officially nominated candidates would be accommodated in key positions once the Congress forms the government in the state.
