AGRA: Barely hours after Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Aligarh Muslim University Students' Union (AMUSU) to remove a portrait of Pakistan founder   from the students' hall, right wing activists clashed with university students while attempting to force their way into the campus to remove the portrait on Wednesday. Police later carried out lathicharge and fired tear gas shells at the protesting students. 

  Slogan-shouting members of Hindu Jagran Manch, HYV and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ) were challenged by   students when the former tried to make their way into the campus to forcibly remove the portrait. The right-wing activists first reached the gate in the afternoon but were prevented from entering by security staff posted there. 
 
 AMU students armed with sticks reached the gate and confronted the activists. Shortly afterwards, police resorted to lathicharge and fired tear gas shells to disperse nearly 1,000 AMU students marching to the police station. They were demanding cases against the activists, as well as   MP   who had raised the issue in the first place. 
 
 UP DGP OP Singh said, "The situation is under control but moderate force had to be used to disperse the students as the situation could have worsened.   has been deployed around the campus and senior officers are monitoring the situation. Some persons have been rounded up."
 
  Meanwhile, asserting that Jinnah is not a role model for Indian Muslims, minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Wednesday said he was confident that the "patriotic" AMU administration and the students would resolve the row with a "sensitive approach", PTI reported. Naqvi also said things have "changed" in India after 1938, when Jinnah was accorded life membership of the AMU students' union.
