CHENNAI: More than 500  , under the `Federation of Civic and Welfare Associations of  ', sat on a fast on Friday demanding the   (ASI) lift the ban order on   in the area.

 Civic activist V Santhanam who led the protest said, “The ASI Chennai unit has already conveyed to New Delhi that 80% of the site is not fit for any research and Pallavaram can be exempted, but the Centre has not taken any step to scrap the order.“ Local residents said they have been living there for over five decades and have been unable to either construct or alter their houses.
 
 Pallavaram municipal councillor M Chandrakesavan, who has been fighting for the cause, said the ASI had declared the area, which it classified as a megalithic site, unfit for research so there was no reason for the ban.
