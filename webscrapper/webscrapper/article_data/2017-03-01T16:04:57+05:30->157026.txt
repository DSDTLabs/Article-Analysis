 When   got in touch with the actor, he clarified, “That is a rumour; the story has been twisted. I had to halt for at least 10-15 minutes at every small village along the way because people wanted to meet and greet me as well as felicitate me. People were climbing on top of my car and banging on it to grab my attention. In the process, the rear windscreen broke. This happened at  , before I attended the event. I have visited 20-30 places over the last few days, and no one has reported that. But this has become big news — I guess people are attracted to negativity. I have taken up an initiative to rejuvenate lakes, and would like the focus to be on that.”
