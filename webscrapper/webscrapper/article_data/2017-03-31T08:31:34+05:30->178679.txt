PUNE: Debananda Das, the father of Antara Das, was shocked to learn that   — the prime suspect in his daughter’s murder — had been  .

 “This is a shocker. It shows the inefficiency of police. How they could not file a chargesheet even after three months? How they have no evidence? Also, the police had told me the hearing was on April 4,” Debananda told TOI over phone from Sarsuna in Kolkata. “I am a poor man and don’t have the resources to fight. I shall consult some close relatives to decide on what to do next,” he said.
 
 Akhilesh Gupta, the father of prime suspect Santosh, did not have a clue that his son had got bail.
 
 “He got bail? I had no idea about it. One can easily understand the condition of a family whose son is in jail for three months,” Gupta told TOI over phone from Bhojpur in Bihar. Gupta said he would ask his son to come back. “I don’t know what happened and how my son got trapped in this. We are worried about his career and life now,” he added.
