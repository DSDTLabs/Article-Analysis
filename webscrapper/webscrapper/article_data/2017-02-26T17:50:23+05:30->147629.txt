Telugu- Kannada actress  , who is debuting in Mollywood with the upcoming Asif Ali-starrer  , will showcase a unique performance in the film ' pole dancing. 

 Shilpi, who plays an actress in the movie will be performing it as part of a song sequence in the film.
 According to the actress, she was caught off guard when the movie's choreographer suggested that it can be included in the film. 'At first, I felt a bit uneasy about it and was wondering, 'Oh my God, how can I do it in a Malayalam film.' Moreover, there was a decent-sized crowd at the location. But then, I just garnered courage and decided to go for it,' she says.
 
 Though a contemporary-style dancer, the only experience she has in pole dancing is, funnily enough, performing while playing truth or dare during her college days! 'I haven't ever watched it for real, except in movies. However, I had an idea about the kind of moves, expressions and the rhythm that goes into it. I brought out the nakhras and the seductress-style body language as best as I could. The song in which we incorporate it is a Malayalam track with a Bollywood feel. That too helped me get my moves right,' Shilpi says.
 
 With regard to the costume for the sequence, she says, 'My attire for the song is quite sexy, though not a very revealing one. And many present on the set complimented me saying that I carried it off well. I hope it reflects on the screen too.'
