NAGPUR: NMC’s electricity department has submitted a proposal for full and final settlement of one of the LED street light contractors to the standing committee meeting convened on May 19. Actually, the   had planned to replace all of the city’s approximately 1.26 lakh sodium vapour street lights with brighter and energy-efficient LED ones. 

 The civic body had, in May 2014, appointed   to replace 26,712 street lights with LED ones in 18 months. The operator managed to replace less than 1,000 street lights since then. Besides, nearly 25,200 street lights on arterial roads and another 37,800 in residential areas remain out of order. Subsequently, the department had served a show cause notice to the firm why the contract should not be scrapped. 
 
 In return, the firm had served a notice demanding over Rs17 crore from NMC including its dues of over Rs8.30 crore. Later, the NMC had moved a proposal to terminate JK Solutions’ contract. After several meetings and deliberations, the firm had agreed for full and final settlement. The NMC will pay it Rs10.15 crore. 
 
 However, scrapping the contract will not hamper the ongoing replacement work as the NMC had decentralized the work to replacement of existing lights by entrusting the job to another eight firms.
 
 Four more proposals will come up for standing panel’s nod and they include hiring 10 tippers for ongoing rivers cleanliness drive, Rs200 life insurance scheme ‘Janshree’ for students of NMC schools, construction of compound wall for Bhandewadi dumping yard and procuring of two freezer boxes for bodies.
