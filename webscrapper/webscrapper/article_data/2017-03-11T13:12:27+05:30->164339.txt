Rasika Dugal, who plays a domestic help in the director's film, will now move on to the Manto biopic.

 Mirror (February 11) had earlier reported that the four directors of Ashi Dua's 'Bombay Talkies' -Karan Johar, Anurag Kashyap,   and Dibakar Banerjee -were reuniting for another as-yet-untitled project, produced by Ashi and Ronnie Screwvala, with a similar format.However, this project is not a sequel to the earlier anthology of four shorts.
 Zoya's film features Bhumi Pednekar and Neil Bhoopalam. Now, Mirror has learnt that 'Qissa' actress   also makes a special appearance in the film as a domestic help.
 
 “It was just a day's work in February. I shot with Bhumi and I wish I had scenes with Neil too whom I have known for years. Ah well, another time,“ rues Rasika, whom Zoya spotted in Tisca Chopra's short film Chutney and called her to complement on her performance.
 
 “Zoya's films are a good mix of entertainment and content. I enjoyed 'Dil Dhadakne Do' but 'Luck By Chance' was easier to relate to, as I was an actress looking for work too earlier,“ laughs the 32-year-old actress, who will essay Manto's wife Safia in Nandita Das's biopic on Saadat Hasan Manto toplined by Nawazuddin Siddiqui.
 
 “I have been reading Dastavez, a five-volume collection of Manto's work with some guidance from an Urdu teacher. I can read and write Urdu. The film is set in the late '40s and early '50s. I want to understand the era well and have been watching a few films from the times as a part of my prep too,“ says Rasika.
 
 On Safia's relationship with Manto, she says that there are many things she didn't know about the writer which she has learnt from Nandita's research.“Manto was a doting husband and would also involve himself with household chores,“ smiles Rasika, who will start filming for the biopic from April.
