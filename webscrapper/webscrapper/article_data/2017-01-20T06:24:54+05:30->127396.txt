KOLKATA: Trouble broke out on the  's   on Thursday as two groups - allegedly   factions - clashed. While one group was allegedly led by the student organisation president Jaya Dutta, those belonging to the other group were allegedly followers of former TMCP president Ashok Rudra. 

 The ruckus forced registrar Soma Bandyopadhyay and other CU officials to seek police help. Bandyopadhyay later said she had called joint CP (headquarters) Supratim Sarkar immediately after the   broke out. "I requested him to take all necessary security measures, including police patrolling and police posting in all six hostels which are sensitive as well as on the other campuses," she said. Jorasankho police immediately sent forces.
 
 According to the students on the campus, Dutta allegedly entered the CU campus with several outsiders from other local colleges. While Dutta went to meet vice-chancellor Ashutosh Ghosh, the TMCP supporters waited outside. When she returned, trouble broke out.
 
 "The supporters of Ashok Rudra fought over the nominations cancelled during scrutiny in CU," said a student of Bengali PG II. Though Dutta was present on the campus, Rudra was not there.
 
 When contacted, the VC said Dutta requested them to ensure free and fair election on the campus. "I assured her that every student will be able to exercise their voting rights without any interruption," the CU vice-chancellor said.
 
 Rudra said that he was only a member of Trinamool Youth Congress. "I have nothing to do with the violence inside campus," he said. Dutta, however, assured that action would be taken if it's found out that TMCP members were involved in the clash.
