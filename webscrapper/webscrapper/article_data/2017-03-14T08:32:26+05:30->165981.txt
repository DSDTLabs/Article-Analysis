KOCHI: Police have arrested a youth,   (26), on charges of abetting the suicide of CA student  , who was found dead in Kochi backwaters near the Ernakulam wharf last Monday. 

 They have reportedly found that Cronin, also a distant relative of Mishel, had made many calls besides sending over 50 text messages to the girl. "Her phone was switched off by 3.35pm on Sunday last; the last call was from Cronin's phone," a senior police officer said. "She had reportedly told him that she had some plans and he would know them on Monday."
 
 Police said they were in contact for about two years before the girl ended their relationship in April. "He has admitted calling her repeatedly even after she forbade him from doing so," the officer said. The investigators on Monday also questioned another man who stalked the girl in Kochi but couldn't find any links with the incident.
