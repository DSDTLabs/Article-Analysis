NOIDA: Sector 51 RWA complained of blocked sewers in F block of the sector since last 15 days. 

 According to the sector RWA, the problem of blocked sewers in F block has been recurrent and persistent since last two years especially when sewer lines and drains of village   were connected to the F block. The problem compounded with the ongoing metro work affecting sewers of D, E and F blocks say the RWA.
 
 The sector RWA maintain that they have made three complaints through jansunwai (public hearing) of chief minister   vide no 4001411800975 of Jan 14, 2018, second vide number 40014118001269 of Jan 18 and third vide number 40014118001562 of Jan 22, 2018. But there's no response so far. The RWA have again written to CEO  , ACEO R K Mishra and sewer department on Friday (Feb 02) as sewer water is overflowing with stench in the area now.
 
 “The F-block of sector 51 is an ‘A’ category block, yet the authority has not provided proper drains and sewer line to this block. On top of that villagers of neighbouring Hoshyiarpur have merged their drain with the sewer common to F block leading to the recurrent problem of overflowing and blocked drains in the sector. The problem further compounded when metro work began in the area about two years back further blocking the sewers of not only F block but also of blocks D and E too. As result, the situation today is that since last 15 days sewer water with acute stink is overflowing from blocked drains in the area leaving it unbearable for residents to breathe or walk past the block,” said  , RWA general secretary sector 51.
 
 According to Kumar, even as water from blocked sewers has overflown on to the sector road, vacant plots and other low lying areas like basement of homes etc., repeated complaints to authority has yielded no results or action. “Senor officers of authority visited this block almost every year but failed to provide functional drains,” said Kumar who sites three recent complaints made through CM jansunwai (public hearing) vide numbers of 4001411800975 of Jan 14, 2018, second vide number 40014118001269 of Jan 18 and third vide number 40014118001562 of Jan 22, 2018.
 
 “The sewer department of Noida Authority has turned blind eyes to our complaints, suffering and do not respond at all,” said Anil Prakash Ranotra, RWA president sector 51.
 
 As a result, the sector RWA have written to authority CEO Alok Tandon on the matter on Friday (Feb 2) with copy of their letter to ACEO R K Mishra and the sewer department and sought remedial action on an urgent basis.
