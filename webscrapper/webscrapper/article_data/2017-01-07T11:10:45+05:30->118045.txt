CHANDIGARH: Advising residents of the Tricity on ways to prevent a  , renowned  , director of cardiology in Mohali, said these winters are especially hard on the  .

 He said, “During winter, there is a change in the ratio of daylight hours to dark hours, which changes the hormonal balance. The hormones involved, such as cortisol, can lower the threshold for a cardiovascular event. The drop in temperatures cause the arteries to tighten, thus restricting blood flow and reducing oxygen supply to heart. All of this can trigger a heart attack.”
 
 Emphasizing on more  , he added, “During my long period of medical practice, I’ve seen people suffer the most due to lack of awareness about their own health. If somebody is already at the risk of cardiovascular disease due to genetics, obesity or stress, then they need to be tender to their heart. Start slow and don’t increase the intake of fatty foods, even though the cold weather might tempt you to indulge in sugary sweets.”
 
 For the people of northern region, it’s especially important to ensure they keep themselves insulated and healthy to avoid increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, he added. “The nearby high climes get snow and the mercury drops drastically. When the weather is cold, the heart has to work harder to maintain body heat,” the doctor shared.
