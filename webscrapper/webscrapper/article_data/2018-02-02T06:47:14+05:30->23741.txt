AHMEDABAD: The   (IFSC) at Gujarat International Finance Tec City (GIFT City) in Gandhinagar is set to be positioned as a global financial hub with   2018-19 proposing to establish a unified authority for regulating all financial services.

 Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said that IFSC needs a coherent and integrated regulatory framework to fully develop and to compete with other offshore financial centres. 
 
 GIFT IFSC is the only such financial centre operational in India.
 
 “A unified regulator for IFSC would help India achieve its full potential in the global financial markets. Globally, most of the financial centres host a unified regulator in the same centre, which helps it promote the facility. Government of India’s initiative duly supported by all existing regulators would go a long way in establishing GIFT IFSC as a global financial Hub,” said Ajay Pandey, managing director and group CEO, GIFT City.
 
 The Budget also proposed providing more concessions for IFSC as the government has endeavoured to develop a world-class international   centre in India. 
 
 “In order to promote trade in stock exchanges located in IFSC, I propose to exempt transfer of derivatives and certain securities by 29 non-residents from capital gains tax. Further, non-corporate taxpayers operating in IFSC shall be charged alternate minimum tax (AMT) at concessional rate of 9% at par with minimum alternate tax (MAT) applicable for corporates,” the FM stated in the Budget speech.
 
 Terming the Budget as very positive for India INX, the international exchange of   (BSE) at GIFT IFSC, V Balasubramaniam, MD and CEO said, “All transactions on our exchange will now be exempt from capital gains (both long term and short term) in derivatives for all non-residents, which include both foreign portfolio investors and eligible foreign investors. Also, the announcement of creating a unified financial market regulator at GIFT IFSC is a welcome move and will bring focus on the IFSC.”
