BENGALURU: Senior officers of the special investigating team (SIT) probing the murder of journalist-activist   confirmed  , the only accused arrested in the case, will be taken to Gandhinagar, Gujarat for a narco analysis test later this week. This despite a letter surfacing, indicating Kumar had back-pedalled on consenting to the test.

 The Forensic Science Laboratory, Gandhinagar, has opened a 15-day slot beginning April 16 to conduct the test. M N Anucheth, chief investigating officer, SIT, has passed on this information to  , advocate of the accused, and has asked him to be present during the tests.
 
 Consent of the accused is necessary for a  , and on March 12, the 3rd additional chief metropolitan magistrate court had cleared the decks for the test after Kumar had assented. Now, sources say, Kumar wants his consent revoked. In a letter addressed to the jailer, Parappana Agrahara Central Prison, Kumar had sought help to “inform the court” about his latest decision not to undergo the test.
 
 However, B K Singh, head of the SIT, said the letter to the jailer is irrelevant since Kumar had already agreed to the test.
 
 Kumar’s lawyer revealed he was unaware of the letter. “The chief investigating officer asked me to be present at the time of the tests,” Murthy said. “I told him I will attend and asked him to tell me the date and time.”
 
 Kumar was initially arrested for illegal possession of a firearm in February. On March 2, SIT arrested Kumar and charged him with the murder of Lankesh. Sources say he has not revealed all the details about the murder and hence the narco test. Police said they will conduct polygraph-lie detection, narco analysis and brain electrical oscillations signature profiling (BEOS) tests on Kumar.
