MUMBAI: In a respite for cop  , a special court accepted the closure report submitted by anti-corruption bureau ( ) in a disproportionate assets case. Special judge D K Gudadhe said, "Final report as submitted needs to be accepted. Accordingly, report is accepted." A report by the investigating agency in 2010 giving the officer a reprieve was rejected by the court. 

 Nayak was accused of amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income. In the case registered against him, his wife and two others, Rajendra Phadte and Palli Manivellan, in January 2006, ACB alleged that Nayak had acquired benami properties worth Rs 60 lakh in his and his wife's names. Nayak was in jail for 59 days before being granted bail in April 2006. The properties investigated were an 800 sq ft flat at Charkop, the defunct   and a school allegedly started by Nayak in Karnataka in his mother's name, at a cost of Rs 1 crore. 
 
 Sources said ACB filed the closure report as there was no evidence against him. They said that this was why the sanction was rejected thrice by the government as well director-general of police. Nayak, who had been suspended for nearly five and a half years was reinstated in 2012. Once the closure report is filed, Nayak will be eligible to get the salary of that period and a promotion to the rank of police inspector. In 2010, when ACB had submitted the closure report, it had said the competent authority had refused to grant sanction to prosecute him.
 
 Nayak and his advocate Shreyansh Mithare did not comment.
