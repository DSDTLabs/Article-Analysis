 The airport premises will also have residential buildings, multi-level car parking facility and an administration building, among other utility buildings. The total cost of the project is Rs 1,200 crore.
 
 Upset over the delay, frequent flyer Deepak Kumar said the authorities should start and coompete the work as soon as possible. “The airport turns quite crowded during daytime,” he said.
