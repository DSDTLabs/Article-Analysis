Ahmedabad: Jigar Joshi, a resident of Naroda, and his associates Sandeep Chauhan, Bhagyesh Joshi, Amit Patel and Tejas Patel, posed as big wholesale traders. They rented lavish offices on Corporate Road and Gurukul Road. They identified and contacted traders using the internet, bought grain, iron and electronic items in large quantities and then vanished without making payments.

 Using this modus operandi, the gang cheated traders in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh out of more than Rs 3 crore. With seven offences registered against the gang, police from Gujarat, Rajasthan and MP were in hot pursuit of them.
 
 Ahmedabad crime branch busted the gang on Friday, by nabbing the prime accused, Jigar Joshi, from near Haridarshan Crossroads in Naroda. The details that tumbled out during Joshi’s interrogation shocked even crime branch officials.
 
 Sub-inspector J N Goswami of crime branch said Joshi confessed to having planned everything to perfection. They had opened the offices, in the name of Jai Ambe Corporation at Corporate Road and Futura Enterprise at Gurukul Road, about one year ago.
 
 “They got these businesses registered with the local administration and opened current accounts in various banks. They gathered the names and contact details of local iron, grain and electronic goods traders from the internet and called them with huge orders. They even made partial payments to the traders through cheque and RTGS,” added sub inspector Goswami.
 
 Crime branch officials said that once the goods were received, they would vanish without making full payment. “They cheated Haresh Purohit, an iron trader out of Rs 25 lakh, Amul Electric Goods of 920 ceiling fans, a grain trader from Kota in Rajasthan of Rs 2.5 crore and grain traders from Ujjain and Indore out of lakhs,” a crime branch official added.
 
 PSI Goswami said they are interrogating Joshi to learn the whereabouts of his associates and to ascertain if they gang is involved in more   cases.
