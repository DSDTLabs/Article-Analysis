COIMBATORE: The city corporation has launched bicycle sharing initiative at Kumaraguru College of Technology here on Sunday. To be operated via a mobile application, under this initiative one does not care to leave the bicycle at the shed from where it was picked up.

 ofo, the company implementing the project, will deploy more than 100 bicycles across the campus spread across nearly 35 acre. 
 
 The bicycles will be available for easy commute within the campus. Requiring no docking stations, ofo’s bicycle sharing system will provide significant flexibility to users to find and return bicycles.
 
 “The bicycle sharing system was mooted under the smart city project to bring down the pollution levels in the city. This is a pilot and we have plans to replicate this model across the city to promote a green mode of transportation,” said corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan. 
 
 Rajarshi Sahai, director of public policy & communications, ofo, said they were pleased to associate with the Kumaraguru College of Technology. 
 
 "Through this pilot, we wish to provide people with a taste of an ‘easy-to-use’ bicycle-sharing experience and educate them with various benefits associated with cycling. Unlike other such offerings, ofo frees its users from the hassles of picking a bicycle from a docking station and leaving it in another,”   said.
