BAMBOLIM:   Ramdev took a light-hearted dig at union I&B minister   by suggesting that the whole controversy surrounding the punitive directions to be imposed on journalists for alleged fake news was an indicator of what happens when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s guidance is not sought. 

 “Two problems I encounter in my day; 99% of the time I hear bad news and fake news. Even the government is trapped in the fake news saga. With great difficulty it has come out of it,What   doesn’t plan, ends up like this,” he said.
