Winning the   is a matter of pride, and after Wrong Side Raju winning this coveted title in 2017, this year it was   directed   that has brought home the award.

 Says Manish, “We always wanted to take our film to different film festivals and see what kind of response we get. And it all went well for us as we received a positive response from the audience in all the film festivals we screened Dhh including the Toronto International Film Festival, which was a great boost for our morale. Getting recognition and appreciation at such global platforms only add more value to the film and it gives us more confidence to tell the audience that we have made a good film and that they should go and watch it.”
  And now that the film has also received the National Award, things only look positive from here on.
