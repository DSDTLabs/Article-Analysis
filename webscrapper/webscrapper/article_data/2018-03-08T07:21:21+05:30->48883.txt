ALLAHABAD: Even as the Election Commission (EC) issued a show cause notice to UP cabinet minister   ‘Nandi’ on Wednesday for his recent remark against BSP chief  , the minister tendered a written apology saying “his intent was not to hurt or insult someone”.

 “I came to know that sentiments of some people were hurt due to my speech at the public rally at Durga Puja Park in Preetamnagar. I want to clarify that my intention was not to hurt or insult someone and I was only reading a WhatsApp message sent to me with ‘Bura na mano holi hai’ (Don’t feel offended, it’s Holi) as caption,”   said in the apology letter.
 
 
 During an election rally in Phulpur on March 4, Nandi allegedly equated BSP chief Mayawati with Ramayan character Surpanakha.CM Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM   was present at the rally.
 
 District election officer and district magistrate   said on Wednesday, “A show cause notice has been issued to cabinet minister Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’ and he has been asked to reply at the earliest. Besides, the EC also sought a detailed report on the issue which we have sent.”
