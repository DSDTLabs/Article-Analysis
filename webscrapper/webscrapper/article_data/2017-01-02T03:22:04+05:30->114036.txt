LUCKNOW: The temporary truce called in the   first family has done little to calm the frayed nerves in the SP cadres. On Friday, supporters who spilt out on the streets of Lucknow, burnt effigies of SP chief  , and beat state president   Yadav’s posters with shoes, suddenly had the winds taken out of their sails after MSY revoked Akhilesh Yadav’s expulsion from SP, hinting at a temporary, if tense, truce.

 With the feud appearing to be headed for a happy-ending, and ‘chacha’ Shivpal emerging to make the “happy” announcement, even warring factions appeared unsure about which way to turn. Legislators in Shivpal’s camp, for instance —Narad Rai, Om Prakash Singh and Shadab Fatima —seemed uncertain about their political future in the likely event of Akhilesh taking over the reins of the  . Their supporters from back home, who were, till yesterday, aggressively critical of the CM too fell silent.
 
 A SP member from Ghazipur, and supporter of former minister Om Prakash Singh, who has been in Lucknow since early in the week in a show of solidarity, was seen singing a different tune on Saturday.
 
 He said, “We are grateful to the SP chief for revoking the CM’s expulsion. It shows both Mulayam Singh ji and Shivpal ji have a large heart. The CM is a good man, but he should be grateful for this support.”
