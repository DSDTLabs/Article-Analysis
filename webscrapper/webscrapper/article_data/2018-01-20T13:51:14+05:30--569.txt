BENGALURU: On the map of Bengaluru, Bellandur falls along the tech corridor, close to the IT hub of  , and many professionals have made it home. But for residents living in and around Bellandur Lake area, like Greenglen Layout and Sun City apartments, the uproar and action in the aftermath of a fire is nothing but a knee-jerk reaction.

 Jayanta Tewari, a   employee living in Sun City flats for the past five years, said that practically nothing has changed on the ground.
 
 “We had requested a Gantt chart which would detail the plans, tenders to be called and the action to be taken, but they have not done it. We are suffering and nobody listens. If the lake is not cleaned properly, these incidents are expected,” he said. A steady stench from the lake is an everyday affair.
 
 “Brand Bengaluru is taking a further hit. Looking at the infrastructure, my American clients actually refuse to come here for meetings,” he added.
 
 KC  , hydrogeologist and former member of the  , said the only remedy was to ensure that no untreated sewage enters the natural drains or any of the lakes. “The burden is on Varthur and Bellandur lakes because they are at the tail-end of the cascading lakes. The sewage destroys the ecosystem around the lake. Organic material like human waste, domestic waste etc release methane, which can catch fire. The natural drains that were supposed to carry rainwater now contain mainly sewage,” he said.
 Questions remain over the type of treatment the STPs will provide. “We need to know whether the water will be treated on a primary or secondary basis, or be made potable,” he said.
