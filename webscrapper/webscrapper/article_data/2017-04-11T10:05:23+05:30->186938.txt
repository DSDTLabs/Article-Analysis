NEW DELHI: With less than two weeks left for the polls, Delhi Congress has decided to initiate a campaign by bringing in their senior leaders to interact with the public and apprise them about the party’s plan of streamlining the three corporations, if they are voted to power.

 Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) spokesperson said that the former ministers and senior members  , Jairam Ramesh and   will join morning walkers and joggers in different areas and interact with them in the next coming days.
 
 “We will seek SEC’s permission on Tuesday and organise meetings accordingly in the next three days,” said the spokesperson.
 
 DPCC along with the leaders had launched three blueprints on the steps they plan to take to streamline sanitation, revenue system, primary education and health sector of the corporations.
 
 “Tharoor will discuss the steps we aim to take to enhance the quality of education in primary schools, while Chidambaram will talk about how to improve the revenue system of the corporations. Ramesh will tell people about the current condition of sanitation in the capital and how the party can improve it by taking modern techniques into consideration, if we are voted to power,” said the spokesperson.
 
 On March 6, DPCC chief Ajay Maken along with Chidambaram had launched their first blueprint on fiscal management of the corporations where they had proposed different reforms that can improve the revenue collection system. For instance, Congress has proposed that they will not increase tax but improve the property tax collection from current 30% to at least 75-80%.
 
 Ramesh had presented the blueprint on sanitation on March 26 and former Union minister Tharoor had presented the final blueprint on primary education on March 30.
 
 The three blueprints are the roadmap of Congress, which has the detailed proposals to improve the current condition of the corporations and will also play a major role in the party’s manifesto.
