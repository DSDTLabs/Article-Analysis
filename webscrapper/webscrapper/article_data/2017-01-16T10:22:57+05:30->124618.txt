 He asked the district administration to set up a meeting for him with the actor and threatened to end his life otherwise.
 
 The youth,  , made the threat while standing precariously on the edge of a stone step inside the well while holding on to a rope.
 
 When Nawalgarh police station house officer (SHO) Nawal Kishore Meena and other officials reached the spot, Shamshad asked them to set up a meeting with the actor in Mumbai even as he threatened to let go of the rope.

 Shamshad’s father Nizamuddin also assured him to buy a ticket to Mumbai and asked him to come out of the well. “He came out with the help of cops. We took him to the police station where he was detained and questioned,” Meena added.

 The youth is said to be a Bollywood film buff and a Devgan fan. Such is his obsession that he once tore movie posters of other actors. “He has memorised all the dialogues from movies in which Devgan has acted. He has not had formal education and spends his time watching movies,” cops said.
