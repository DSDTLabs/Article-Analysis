GANDHINAGAR: Jignesh  , independent MLA from Vadgam, along with other Dalit activists submitted a memorandum on Monday to chief secretary J N Singh and demanded a survey of the actual possession of lands allotted to the poor Dalit beneficiaries alleging that for years Dalit had land on paper but in reality they didn’t have physical possession the land.

 Mevani said, “Despite the state revenue department’s circular to all district collectors, in accordance with the assurance given to the high court to survey all the land given to Dalit beneficiaries under the agriculture land ceiling act, no such survey took place. Dalit activist Bhanubhai Vankar committed suicide because of the government’s apathy in giving possession of land to Dalits.”
 
 Reacting to Jignesh Mevani and other Dalit activists’ warning to BJP leaders not to touch Dr B R Ambedkar’s statue on April 14 (his birthday),   minister of state (home)   said: “Ambedkar was not the leader of any community. He was a national leader. All BJP MLAs and MPs will go to garland his statues across the state. There will be ample police bandobast for this.” tnn
