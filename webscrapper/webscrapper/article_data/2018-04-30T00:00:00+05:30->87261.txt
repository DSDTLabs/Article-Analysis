 An out-and-out comedy, a part of the film was expected to be shot in Uzbekistan, where the two go on a vacation. Mimi and Dev earlier did films like Yoddha and Sudhu Tomari Jonyo, and the ensemble cast further includes Saswata Chatterjee, Sudiptaa Chakraborty, Koneenica Banerjee, Priyanka Sarkar, Pooja Bose and Kharaj Mukherjee. Said a source close to the unit, “Rukmini had earlier said that she was not doing the film, but the cast underwent a change recently. The Dev-Rukmini pair is fast gaining popularity and the two of them want to continue doing films together. While Dev plays a ghar jamai,   will be seen as his wife.” When CT got in touch with director  , he said, “I am yet to learn about this decision. In fact, you are the first one to have told me this!” Despite repeated calls, Mimi could not be reached.
