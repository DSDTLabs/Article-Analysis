NEW DELHI: A two-year-old   was kidnapped from west Delhi’s Hari Nagar by his neighbour on Sunday, which was incidentally the child’s birthday, and   twice before he was   by the police.

 The boy’s mother, Neelam, told the police that as the family had shifted to the capital a fortnight ago, she started working as a household help temporarily to earn a living. “One of the households where I work asked me to come on Sunday, so I put my son to sleep and left. When I returned half an hour later, my son was missing,” she said.
 
 Probe revealed that after Neelam left, the boy woke up and went outside. His neighbour, Karan, lured him on the pretext of giving him money and kidnapped him. After a few hours, he met an associate near his house and sold the child to him for Rs 30,000.
 
 Karan told the cops that he wanted to buy a motorcycle for long, so when his associate, the first buyer, approached him with the offer, he hatched a plan to kidnap the boy. His associate met the second buyer the next morning and handed over the child to him for another Rs 30,000.
 
 “After the family lodged a complaint, a team led by Hari Nagar SHO Rajesh Kumar scanned   footage from the area. One such video showed Karan calling the boy towards him, which helped crack the case. The accused was subsequently arrested from his house,” said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.
 
 At first, Karan denied involved in the crime, but later confessed to having kidnapped the boy. Police are on the lookout for the two buyers and their families are being questioned to get clues about their hideouts. The boy and his family members are being counselled, said a senior police officer.
