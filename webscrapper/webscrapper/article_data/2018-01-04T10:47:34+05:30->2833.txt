This will be the year of action on the e-vehicle front. From announcements to policies, 2018 will have an eventful calendar with automakers taking baby steps towards making evehicles a reality.

 
 The government will soon announce “an all-encompassing” Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) — 2 scheme. It is expected to layout a broader roadmap for the industry’s march towards electric vehicles.
 
 
 The year could also possibly see some reconciliation between the industry and the Union ministry of roads, transport and highways headed by  . He has warned the industry to move to electric vehicles by 2030, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) recently said in a white paper that 2047 looks more like it.
 
 
 Gadkari’s warning ruffled feathers in the industry. A few spoke out against the threat and said an all-electric fleet by 2030 might not be ideal for India.
 
 
  India chief Roland Folger said once the industry moved to Bharat Stage (BS)-VI emission norms for petrol and diesel vehicles on April 1, 2020, India would move to an “optimum” emission regime. He said there was a need to see how electricity was produced and the source of pollution should not be shifted from cities to generating stations on the outskirts.
 
 
 Automakers also highlighted the risk in the strategy to move “hurriedly” to an all-electric fleet in terms of jobs and import substitution. Instead of importing crude, India might end up importing lithium from China,   and   — with whom India doesn’t have notable bilateral trade ties.
 
 
 At the consumer-level, the subsidies for purchase of electric vehicles have been stuck at the same level for years. Another issue is the cost, quality and quantity of electricity.
