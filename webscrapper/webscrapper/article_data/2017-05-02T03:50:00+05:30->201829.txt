Mapusa: Thousands of people from different walks of life attended the feast of Our Lady of Milagres at St Jerome’s Church in   which was celebrated with traditional fervor and religious solemnity.

 Masses were celebrated inside a specially erected pandal outside the church on the feast day. Fr Clive Telles from the Sindhudurg diocese was the main celebrant at the feast mass.
 
 In his homily, Telles highlighted the very concept of miracles and said that everyone should try to be a miracle in someone else’s life. He posed a question ‘Do we need miracles in our life? Do we believe in miracles happening?’ “Science has gone so far that you don’t require to recognize things as miracles because science will always find a reason behind it,” he said.
 
 This feast also brings a number of Hindus because according to folklore, Our Lady of Miracles is one of seven sisters who was converted to the Catholic faith. So the Hindus consider ‘Milagres Saibinn’ as the sister of the Hindu deity ‘Lairaee’ in Shirgao. Devotees also offer candles, oil, money, parts of the human body made of wax or even sarees to Milagres Saibinn with an intention that their favours be granted. The main attraction of the Mapusa feast is the fair, which is popular for furniture items.
