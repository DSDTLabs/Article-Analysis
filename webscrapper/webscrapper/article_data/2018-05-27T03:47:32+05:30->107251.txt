VARANASI: Reacting to incidents of dogs and monkeys attacking people across UP, the state urban development minister   said if a monkey attacked a person in his house, there was not much that ‘satta’ (power) could do. 

 
 The minister was answering a question about what the state government was doing to crackdown on feral dogs killing children in   and increasing incidents of bulls and monkeys attacking residents in Varanasi. Khanna, who is also the incharge minister for Varanasi, also gave an account of Rs 29,527 crore corpus sanctioned by the Centre for over 400 development projects gifted by PM Modi to Varanasi — which is his parliamentary constituency — in the last four years.
 
 Lauding the achievements of the Centre, he said, “As many as 271 projects worth Rs 966.11 crore have been completed so far, while 69 others worth Rs 8,513.59 crore are in progress. The completion of these projects will improve basic infrastructure as well as facilities in education, health and tourism in Varanasi.” 
 
 Khanna added that the UP government would check disposal of sewage in Ganga before the beginning of   in January, 2019. He also said, of the 30 projects proposed under   plan for Varanasi, 17 were being completed and tenders had been invited for 13.
