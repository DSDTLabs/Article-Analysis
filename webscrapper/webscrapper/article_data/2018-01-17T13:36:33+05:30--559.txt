KARWAR: Members of a Karnataka   unit used cow urine and tulsi leaves as they sought to “cleanse” a venue where actor  , a vocal critic of right-wing violence, and a few activists gave speeches this weekend.

 Their motivation, they claimed, was the seminar participants “had an anti-Hindu mindset and most of them were beef eaters”. BJP workers of the party’s Sirsi unit, led by  , district president of the women’s wing, and  , president of BJP’s local youth wing, arrived at the venue, a wedding hall, auditorium on Monday and sprinkled ‘gomutra’ and spread basil leaves. “The kalyana mandapam is a sacred place where different religious programmes have been held for decades. The place lost its sanctity because of the entry of beef-eaters and abusers of Hindu religion,” a worker said.
 
 The move set off a verbal war, with the actor wondering if the saffron cadres would continue their “purification service” wherever he went.
 
 
 
 “BJP workers cleaning and purifying the stage… from where I spoke in Sirsi town… by sprinkling cow urine (divine gomutra)... will you continue this cleaning and purification service where ever I go...?” he posted on Twitter. Raj has been at loggerheads with right-wingers following the death of journalist Gauri Lankesh, a friend of his.
