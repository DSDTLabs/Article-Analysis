NEW DELHI: J Jayalalithaa’s death may have 
  but her 
  , including those of   and two others, will not escape confiscation and forfeiture to realise the Rs 100 crore fine imposed on her by the trial court.

 A   bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and   said, “We are of the opinion that the order of confiscation/forfeiture of properties standing in the name of six companies, as involved, made by the trial court is unexceptionable.”
 
 
 
 
 The SC upheld the trial court order imposing a fine of Rs 10 crore each on Sasikala, V N Sudhakaran and J Elavarasi, who were also sentenced to four years imprisonment.
 
 “In any view of the matter, the peremptory termination of the criminal proceedings resultant on this pronouncement, the direction of the trial court towards confiscation/forfeiture of the attached property, as mentioned therein, is hereby restored and would be construed to be an order of this court,” it said.
 
 The SC also saw through the 
  in league with the other accused to amass disproportionate assets and rejected her plea feigning ignorance about the activities of   and the two others. 
 
 “Although Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi claim to have independent sources of income, the fact of constitution of firms and acquisition of large tracts of land out of funds provided by   indicate that all the accused congregated at Jayalalithaa’s residence ( ) neither for social living nor Jayalalithaa allowed them free accommodation out of humanitarian concern, rather the facts and circumstances proved in evidence undoubtedly point out that Sasikala, Sudhakaran and Elavarasi were accommodated in Jayalalithaa’s house pursuant to criminal conspiracy hatched by them to hold Jayalalithaa’s assets,” the bench said.
