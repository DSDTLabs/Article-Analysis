CHANDIGARH: Former cricketer-turned-politician  , who was finally inducted into the Congress on Sunday, confirms to Rohan Dua that he will contest the   East. The three time MP talks about his new innings.

 
 
 
 Good things always take time. It is a considered decision and choice.
 
 
 
 
 
 I am not going to indulge in any vendetta politics. It will be a campaign of positivity . I'm not going to spend more than 2-3 days in either Patiala or Lambi. I have got the responsibility of whole Punjab.
 
 
 
 
 
 This isn't my first election. I will campaign everywhere and contest from Amritsar East.
 
 
 
 
 There were none.
