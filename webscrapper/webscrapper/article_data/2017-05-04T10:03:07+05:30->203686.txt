Wednesday was indeed a special moment for   and his family as the Bollywood actor received his first ever National Award for Best Actor in the film ‘Rustom’. On this joyous occasion,   was accompanied by his dear wife   and son   – both dressed up gracefully in traditional Indian attires for the big day! It was heart-warming to see the entire family celebrating the actor’s success with great pride.

 To top the ecstasy of the moment, Twinkle, who is known for her wit and humour, posted a funny message on her Instagram handle. “So now I can officially refer to him as my trophy husband :) #NationalFilmAwards #Hurrah,” she cheekily wrote.
