CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Saturday stayed the orders passed by the Kapurthala-based permanent lok adalat, which had restrained the highway authorities from collecting toll at Ladhowal plaza for not taking any road-safety measures. Ladhowal toll tax plaza is located on the   highway.

 Justice Daya Chaudhary of the HC passed these orders after hearing a petition filed by Panipat-Jalandhar NH-1 Tollway Private Limited. The counsel for the company, Sumeet Goel, had submitted that the restraint orders were passed by the lok adalat at the back of the petitioner and the lok adalat had no jurisdiction to pass such orders as per the provisions contained in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.
 
 Goel also informed the HC that the March 15 and April 17 orders of the lok adalat had been complied with. Hearing that, Justice Chaudhary adjourned the hearing of the case for April 24, and ordered to stay the lok adalat’s orders that had restrained the concessionaires from collecting money from the toll.
 
 On March 15, Kapurthala lok adalat chairperson Manju Rana had directed the   ( ) to close illegal access to the highway and ensure barricading.
 
 On April 17, the lok adalat was informed that not a single step had been taken for smooth and safe movement of traffic. “NHAI is stopped from charging toll tax at Ladhowal toll tax barrier near Phillaur, on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway, till the compliance of the order dated March 15, 2018, as toll tax is charged not as revenue for the government, but it is primarily charged for construction of the toll road and collecting charges as toll taxes later on. But the NHAI has failed to do its duty in a proper manner,” judge Rana noted in her order.
