The gorgeous   was recently in the city for a panel discussion on ‘Cancer is Curable’ that was held to mark   on Saturday. “I believed the importance of life after defeating cancer,” said Manisha, who was diagnosed with   in 2012.
The actress went on to share how important it was to stay positive through the painful treatment procedures.
 “Stay away from negative thoughts. Divert your mind, do what you want to do. Watch comedy films, read, have a party atmosphere at home,” Manisha told a 300-plus audience, adding, “Take chemo as vitamin shots. Stay positive during the treatment. It is painful and tough, but with positive mind and thoughts you can conquer cancer. If I could conquer, you too can. What is most important is taking responsibility of your own self and your health because nobody else will do it.”
 The one thing that was stressed upon by the panel of cancer patients, survivors and the world’s most famous cancer care practitioners was early detection. “Do not be scared of cancer, be scared of late diagnosis. Get diagnosed early. Life is not about how long we survive, it’s how we survive,” Manisha said, ending the talk on a positive note.
