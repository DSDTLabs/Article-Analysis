DIBRUGARH: A day after the deadly ambush on   Rifles jawans at Jagun in   district by   (I) and other militant groups, security forces recovered 3   from the   on Monday morning. 

 Several items belonging to the militants, including camouflage attire, backpacks, food packets, first-aid, medicines and water bottles were also found at the site. Some trenches along the road near the site point to the fact that the militants had meticulously planned the attack well in advance.
 
 Special DGP (Law and Order) Kuladhar Saikia, who is camping in the district, said a joint combing operation by police and the Army is underway. Army sniffer dogs have been pressed into service to detect explosives which may have been planted by militants to check the progress of security forces. Poor visibility due to the thick canopy of forests is posing hurdles in the search operation. 
 
 "It was a long stretch of road where the ambush took place. However, the militants could not inflict much damage due to the alertness of security forces. In fact, it was they who suffered more damage. They had to flee leaving their explosives and weapons," Saikia said. 
 
 Two Assam Rifles jawans were killed in the attack while five others sustained injuries. Two militants also died in the gunfight. 
 
 The special DGP further said that northeast militant groups have considerably weakened over the years and have lost their support base among people. "Since the militant outfits are unable to fight on their own due to dearth of manpower and firepower, they have decided to come together and form a united front. But we are prepared to tackle them," he added.
 
 He also negated the Republic Day boycott call given by militant outfits in the northeast saying that every year people come out in large numbers to celebrate the day. 
 
 Tinsukia SP Mugdhajyoti Mahanta on Monday said the two militants killed in Sunday's attack are yet to be identified.
