CHENNAI: As another Pongal festival went off without Jallikattu, DMK working president   on Sunday termed the   government as "incompetent" for not having pressurized the Centre enough to promulgate an Ordinance, which was only to escape I-T raids.

 "Whether it is Cauvery or Jallikattu, the Centre has not heeded to Tamil Nadu's pleas and the ruling party in the state is not ready to pressure the Centre only to escape from raids by income tax department. There are 50MPs in Parliament, but the ruling AIADMK has not been able to make the Centre promulgate an Ordinance for holding Jallikattu this year," accused Stalin.
 
 "It is not enough to keep writing letters to Centre asking them to promulgate an ordinance. It will not work," said Stalin, referring to the chief minister for writing letters to Prime Minister   and other ministers on various issues.
 
 "People will not be silent on issues which are against the interest of Tamils. It is not just people from Tamil Nadu, who will miss the  , but, there are so many foreign tourists, who are aggrieved about not being able to watch the bull sport," he said.
 
 Claiming that youths in the state are angry, Stalin said the day is not far when Jallikattu will be held in the state. "DMK will be with youths on this issue and DMK will continue to raise its voice in the coming days," said Stalin.
