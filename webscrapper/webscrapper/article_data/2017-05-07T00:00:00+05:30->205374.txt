Well-known Marathi actor  , who is known for his perfect comic timing is happy that comedy shows are being well received these days. On World Laughter Day today, Bharat who is currently seen in a popular Marathi show, says, “People are bored of the saas bahu sagas and they are now drawn towards watching comedy shows. This is because audiences do not want to watch a show which does not make them feel happy. Whereas comedy shows allow them to divert their attention from every day stress and laugh their heart out. But let me tell you, comedy is not at all easy. In fact, making the live audience laugh is very difficult. While we do have script in hand, a lot of times we have to be spontaneous and alter the joke as per the response. But the sad thing is that comedians are yet to get their due.” 
 
  
 Bharat who hails from   has made the   dialect very popular on screen. “When artistes from Nagpur or Vidarbha at large try their luck in acting or stand-up comedy in big cities like Mumbai, they tend to communicate in Marathi spoken in  , instead of our region’s dialect. I felt Varhadi dialect was being overshadowed. Hence I made it my USP to popularise this dialect on screen and a lot of people now are fond of the language. I want more and more comic artistes to come from Vidarbha.”
