BHOPAL: The 108 emergency ambulance   remained stalled for the second consecutive day on Thursday. Though health department officials maintained that alternative arrangements were being made, more than 22,000 callers seeking   service were declined across the 51districts of Madhya Pradesh.

 The National Health Mission (NHM) funded ambulance service with a base of more than 600 ambulances is operated by Ziqitza Healthcare Limited (ZHL). “Alternative arrangements are being made by the company. We are constantly monitoring the situation,” said NHM deputy director Dr Durgesh Gauda.
 
 The   continued on Thursday as negotiations with ZHL and off-duty employees failed. “Many of the patients have requested private ambulance service. Taking advantage of the situation, private ambulances have hiked their fee by over 50%,” said a security guard at Hamidia hospital. “Due to the ambulance strike, some patients arrived at the   even on two-wheelers,” he added. Meanwhile, the 108 integrated call centre was reported offline during the day.
 
 “The Madhya Pradesh government and NHM pioneered integrated emergency medical services in India and Ziqitza is honoured to be their chosen partners. As in any large-scale project, there are challenges from time to time that may not always emanate from our end. Our endeavour is to provide the best and speediest possible response to all patient calls,” said ZHL CFO Manish Sancheti.
 
 ZHL employees are seeking full payment of their wages. They allege that ZHL has made improper deductions in their salaries.
 
 “The issue has raised serious questions over the neutrality of NHM. If the government wanted, the issue would have been resolved and there would have been no strike,” said a protesting ZHL employee.
