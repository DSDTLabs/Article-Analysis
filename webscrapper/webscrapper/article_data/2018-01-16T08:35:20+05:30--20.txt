BENGALURU: An ecosystem should be created where society, market and the government work together and enable the process of lifelong learning, EkStep's chairman and non-executive chairman of   Nandan   said. He inaugurated a three-day conference on the Future of Learning at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (IIMB) on Monday. 

  "Micro is the new Mega," Nilekani said. "Today, 2.5 billion people have smartphones and they have options in terms of data, apps and capabilities. This has an impact on education too. Digital unbundling makes every sector, including education, to go from mega to micro and creates new ways to mix and match," he added. 
 
  "In earlier times, learning was a rite of passage. The model was 'study-earn-retire'. This has been replaced by learning as a lifelong activity. We will be learning and earning. Therefore, we must create infrastructure that enables continuous and lifelong learning. Just-in-time learning will also become important and so will learning in small sachets," he added. 
 
  
 
 
  In colla boration with the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, IIMB hosted over 300 delegates from the industry and academia at the conference. The two institutes are slated to host two more such conferences in the next two years. 
 
  IIMB director   said, "The emerging convergence of technologies, entrepreneurship and risk capital can create new educational marketplaces and radically transform the future of educational institutions and the future of education itself."
