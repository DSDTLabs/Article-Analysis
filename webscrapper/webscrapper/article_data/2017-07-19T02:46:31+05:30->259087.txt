NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Irfan   posted a picture of himself and wife on   drawing critical comments from a section of his ‘fans’ for being “unIslamic”.

 Their grouse? The wife’s arms and eyes are visible in the click. Others shamed the woman for wearing nail polish. However, many supported the bowler and asking the former to mind their own business. By 9pm, the photo had over 11,000 comments, 4,000 shares and 2.45 lakh ‘likes.’
 
 The picture posted on Monday evening shows the duo in a car. While Pathan smiles, his wife playfully peeks out from behind her fingers. “This girl is trouble #love #wifey,” Pathan posted.
