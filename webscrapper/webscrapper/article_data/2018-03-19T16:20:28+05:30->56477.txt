It was the inauguration of a salon in the city, and the cynosure of all eyes was Simbu, who rocked a floral pattern shirt and sported a groomed beard. After launching the brand, the actor was spotted indulging in a banter with his good friends from the industry, Venkat and Uma Riyaz Khan. Soon, he was surrounded by his fans, who wanted to click pictures with him. And   smilingly obliged. The event also saw some of city’s favourites in the fashion circuit in attendance. While Medha complemented a grey skirt with floral patterns with a simple red number, Glisandra’s white and black dress earned her some brownie points. Avantika’s lace-heavy outfit and Shivatmika’s one-shoulder top also increased the fashion quotient of the evening.
