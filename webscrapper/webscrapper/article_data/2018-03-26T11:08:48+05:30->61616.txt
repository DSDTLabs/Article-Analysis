PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body has started work on a 2km-long   the   in a bid to mitigate the traffic congestion on other roads in Pimpri and Chinchwad.

 “The two-lane road will begin near the   bridge on the Chinchwad side, proceed along the Pavana river till Bhatnagar slum in Pimpri. It is 2.63km long and 18m wide. The road will also feature a footpath and cycle tracks,” PCMC’s executive engineer said. 
 
 “The work order was issued a month ago, and the project should be done in 17 months. We have demarcated the land and started levelling it. We will later lay the road and tar it,” he added, “This will reduce congestion on Kalewadi main road and Pimpri link road.”
 
 He explained: “People from Thergaon as well as near Pachpir chowk and Kalewadi phata in Kalewadi take the busy Kalewadi main road to reach Pimpri camp. After completion of the new road, they can use the new road after crossing the Keshavnagar-Kalewadi bridge to reach Pimpri Camp and areas along the Pimpri link road in Chinchwad.” 
 
 He added, “Those living in Pimpri camp or Pimpri have will also need not use Kalewadi main road or Pimpri link road to reach Chinchwadgaon and go ahead to Keshavnagar or Thergaon. This will ease traffic congestion on Kalewadi main road and Pimpri link road.”
 
 Aparna Doke, NCP corporator and former mayor, said, “The new road will help in reducing congestion on Pimpri link road. It must be constructed quickly.”
 
 Kailas Mane, Chinchwad resident, said, “There is heavy traffic congestion on the Pimpri link road during peak morning and evening hours, as it is the only main road that links Pimpri on one side and Chinchwad on the other. We expect the river road to reduce this congestion.”
