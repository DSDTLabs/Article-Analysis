MUMBAI: The wife of V K Bindulal Babu(50), deputy general manager at   who was on board the illfated helicopter on Saturday, confirmed that it wasn’t his body at a morgue. The family was called to   hospital on Sunday morning to identify a body that was found at the crash site. They went only to be shown sutured parts of it; the head and most limbs were missing.

 “It was not my husband,” said   (42). “There were no clothes, on blanching too—after pressing the skin—it was clearly not him. He is darkskinned and this body is much lighter,” she said, her expertise as a diabetologist making her even more certain.
 
 Returning back home in Vasai, the petite Shyni appeared stoic, hiding tears as relatives, friends and well-wishers poured in. “What happened was our fate,” she said, mindful even in her grief about serving water and food to friends and family. Their daughter, a Class XII student, has her prelims on. Their son in Class II sat next to his sister in their flat.
 
 She was accompanied by  , a friend of Babu’s and  , a colleague of his. “The torso was bigger than my husband’s.” She remembered how in 2005, he had saved many of his staff when a fire occurred on an oil rig. “He swam for five and half hours to rescue them. About 100 persons were saved then. “With no body, we cannot perform his last rites,” said a relative.
