PUNE: Savitribai Phule Pune University   on Saturday warned of   of violence on the varsity campus. The university has set up a three-member panel to probe into the clash that took place between students of two unions late on Friday night. 

 Addressing a news conference, Gade said, “I appeal to students and organisations not to resort to any kind of violence on the university’s campus. The university will not tolerate it. I am appealing to all students to maintain good, cordial and harmonious atmosphere on the campus.”
 
 “Such violence has never taken place earlier on our campus. The university is a place for intellectual discussion and exchange of ideas. Everybody is free to express his or her views but within the framework of our Constitution. We must respect each other’s thoughts. There has to be a space for each other’s views,” said Gade.
 
 A three-member committee will probe the clash between members of ABVP (Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad) and the SFI (Students Federation of India). A security guard from the university was also allegedly beaten up during the violence. However, Gade said he has no knowledge about the same. Suitable action will be taken after the committee submits its report.
 
 All the walls of the Aniket canteen were full of posters pasted by the students’ the union. Gade said, “We will look into the cleanliness part of the varsity and ensure that the posters are removed from the campus.” The issue of fights between students’ unions is going to be a ‘major challenge’ since students’ elections are now coming back and such chashes are expected to take place, he added.
 
 “We need an entirely different type of security plan and I had two meetings on Saturday with security staffers on how to plan for future. Certain immediate steps need to be taken and the situation demands that professionally trained security be brought in,” he said.
