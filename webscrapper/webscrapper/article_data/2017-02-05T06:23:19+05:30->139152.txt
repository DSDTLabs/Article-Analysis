 Following a tip, officials intercepted the bus near Arambakkam in Tiruvallur district at 7am. They rounded up four suspects and frisked their belongings. Police said the men had concealed the gold bars beneath vegetables and clothes in a leather bag. Twenty gold bars each weighing 168 g were recovered. The gold was being smuggled from the northeast, said police.
 
 The arrested were identified as Jameel, 30,  , 55, Iqbal, 40, and Nizamuddin, 45. All are residents of Mylapore in Chennai. IB officials handed over the men to the Arambakkam police who filed a case. A court later sent them to jail.
 
 Police said the four suspects boarded the bus at Rajahmundry on Friday night. They brought the consignment from the northeast and were planning to deliver it to jewellery manufacturers in the city.
 
 Police have seized their baggage and their mobile phones. â€œThey said they were couriers. They were supposed to get instructions over the phone once they safely reached Chennai," a police official said.
