LUCKNOW: It was the first session of   after BJP government came to power, yet political courtesies and bonhomie were missing as prominent leaders preferred to stay put in seats allotted to them in the House on Monday. There were, however, a few exceptions.

 Even the Leader of the House Chief Minister   headed straight to his chair, exchanging greetings with Opposition members only after he was seated.
 
 Treasury benches were restricted to themselves exchanging handshakes with only a few MLCs in makeshift seats in the well of the House, while the Opposition remained confined to meeting members of their own individual groups.
 
 Ice was broken thanks to Gorakhpur MLA Dr Radha Mohan Das Agrawal and UP cabinet minister   who crossed over to Opposition benches as soon as former chief minister   arrived along with Leader of Opposition Ram Gobind Chaudhary. Though Akhilesh and Chaudhary were meeting MLAs only of their own party, Dr Radha Mohan Das Agrawal came up to them, shook hands and exchange pleasantries with both.
 
 Following suit, Cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya met Akhilesh and Chaudhary even as MLAs from   remarked: “Maurya ji aap to idhar hi aa jaayiye (you should be on our side)”.
 
 Bursting into laughter, Maurya was quick to reply: “When I was here (gesturing towards Opposition benches), you all drove me to that side (treasury benches) and now when I am that side, you want me back.”
 
 Others who switched loyalty from one party or the other to join BJP, such as Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Brijesh Pathak, waved towards the Opposition members but remained mostly close the treasury benches only.
 
 This was perhaps the first time Samajwadi Party senior leader Shivpal Yadav arrived and took his place in the last row. After a few minutes some MLAs requested him to take a seat in the second row right next to Akhilesh and Chaudhary. Akhilesh and Shivpal, did not make eye contact even once.
