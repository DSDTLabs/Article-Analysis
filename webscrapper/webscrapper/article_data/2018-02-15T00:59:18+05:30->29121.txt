Ludhiana: With 10 days to go for municipal corporation elections, less than 20% of the licensed weapon holders have deposited their arms with police stations and arms dealers in Ludhiana. 

 Assistant commissioner of police (arms licensing wing) Naveen Kumar said, “We have a database of licensed weapon holders. Of about 16,187 of them, 2,911 have deposited their arms. The data collected from police stations and gun houses is being monitored regularly.” 
 
 The licensing wing has prepared a list of those who haven’t deposited their weapons, including NRIs, banks, business establishments, Army personnel and those who have moved out of the city, a cop said. 
 
 Not all the owners have to deposit their arms. “More than a thousand weapon holders, including those from banks and security agencies, come under this category,” he added.
 
 “The deadline to deposit weapons is 48 hours before the election day,” said police commissioner Rajendra Dhoke. 
 
 The political parties, meanwhile, want the process be expedited. 
 
 “The police and the election commission must ensure that weapons are deposited at the earliest for free and fair elections. A few days ago, I had sent videos to the police commissioner showing ruling party candidates firing in the air in wards 38 and 39. They were trying to create terror among voters,” said Lok Insaaf Party leader and MLA Balwinder Bains.
 
 “The chief electoral officer should issue strict instructions to the officers concerned to speed up the process, as these weapons can be used for violence in the run-up to polls, especially during campaigning,” said Ravi Sharma, a social activist.
 
 Kumar Ravinder, owner of a gun store in Civil Lines, said, “Of the 700 weapons that are to be deposited at my store, we have received 150, including pistols, revolvers, rifles and single and double barrel guns.”
