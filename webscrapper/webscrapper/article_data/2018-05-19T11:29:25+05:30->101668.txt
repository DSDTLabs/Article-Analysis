HYDERABAD: Residents of Old City and Rajendra Nagar circle will soon visit Chandrayangutta, instead of Sardar Mahal in Charminar to process their applications on civic issues, including building permission, property tax, birth and death certificates.

 
 The new zonal office for   (GHMC)   covering Old City and Rajendra Nagar circle (proposed  ) is being constructed at Naseeb Nagar in Chandrayangutta.
 
  
  
 
 The five storied building will be operational within a year. The existing building will be conserved as part of Charminar Pedestrian Project, said GHMC zonal commissioner (South Zone) Srinivas Reddy. With the existing zonal office in bad shape, the need for a new building came up in GHMC meeting.
 
 Some residents say the new office will help them save travel time. “I had to change the ownership of my newly purchased flat and I ended up losing an entire day. I believe the people of Rajendra Nagar will be greatly benefitted now,” said Srinivas Murty, a resident of Rajendra Nagar. Similar opinion was expressed by Zulfekar Mohammed, a resident of Faluknama.
 
 Syed Minhajuddin, corporator from Akberbagh said they had proposed an office at Mallakpet, adding that it would be more more beneficial for locals.
 
 “If an office comes up at the printing press, it would be good for them. We proposed that if separate offices comes up at vacant land in Malakpet owned by government, it would benefit people from Malakpet and Santosh Nagar circle which also covers Akberbagh, Saidabad and IS Sadan,” added Minhajuddin.
