AMRITSAR: A US-based NGO EcoSikh has mooted a plan to develop 100 acres of land around Gurdwara   Sahib in   district of Pakistan as a 'sacred' forest to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev in 2019. EcoSikh president Rajwant Singh informed   on Friday that they also plan to develop the area as an eco-tourism hub. 

 Guru Nanak Dev had reached at Kartarpur Sahib in 1522 and lived a simple life by tilling fields for nearly 17 years before leaving for his heavenly abode in 1539. Later a gurdwara was constructed in Kartarpur Sahib. During Partition, the gurdwara went to Pakistan. 
 
 Rajwant informed that member of Punjab (Pakistan) provincial assembly Ramesh Singh   has been actively pursuing the matter with the Pakistan government. "Hopefully the Pakistan government will send a message to the world that it respects Guru Nanak and members of the minority Sikh community," he said adding it will create a positive image of the country. Arora told TOI, "There are proposals to develop the area around Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib as a sacred forest or a botanical garden," he said. 
 
 Rajwant said   had assured to plant 20,000 trees in the proposed 'sacred' forest. Besides, he said, they had also planned to start organic farming, install a solar panel, dedicate forest areas and create ethos of care for thousands of pilgrims who visit Kartarpur every year.
 
 "Environmental protection is crucial for both India and Pakistan as they are victims of environmental degradation and inaction," Rajwant said. He also informed that the Pakistan government has already decided to set up the Guru Nanak   Interfaith Harmony Centre at Kartarpur Sahib to promote dialogue between people of faiths.
