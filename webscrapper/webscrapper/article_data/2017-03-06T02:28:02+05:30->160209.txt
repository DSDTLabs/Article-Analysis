NEW DELHI: With the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the   moving against former CBI director A P Singh with criminal investigations, Singh said he was being “targeted” for reasons unknown to him.

 “It appears I am being targeted but (I) am not sure of the reasons why,” Singh told TOI. ED officials had said on Saturday that they may register a case against Singh under the Prevention of   Act and even attach his properties.
 
 The allegations stem from his association with controversial meat exporter   with whom he shared messages on Blackberry Messenger (BBM) when he was heading CBI.
 
 “I have read newspaper reports. I strongly deny the allegations made against me,” he said.
 
 Singh said he welcomed the probe. “I welcome any CBI and ED investigation and sincerely hope that they will be fair and impartial.
 
 I shall be fully cooperating with any such investigation,” he added.
 
 Last month, CBI registered an FIR against Singh and named him accused, along with Qureshi, to probe corruption charges. It is alleged that Qureshi operated as a middleman for several public servants including Singh.
 
 An I-T department probe against Qureshi found that Singh was talking to the former almost on a ‘daily basis’ on BBM and shared details of a CBI case with him. Some financial transactions of Singh’s daughter with Qureshi are also being probed. Singh had said that most of his exchanges with Qureshi on BBM were “mostly personal and innocuous in nature as between friends”.
 
 The retired IPS officer, who headed the CBI between 2010 and 2012, said none of his BBM messages with Qureshi pertained to the agency’s investigations.
