MUMBAI: Passing the buck for not properly lifting garbage or depositing it in a dumping ground may soon be history as the   has decided that in each ward, a single contractor will be responsible for waste disposal. As a pilot move, the system will be implemented in four wards: R-South (includes Kandivli, Charkop and Poisar); R-North (includes  ); RCentral (comprises Borivli, Gorai and Magathane); and T (Mulund). The period of contract would be seven years. The average cost per ward works out to Rs 115 crore, with the total contract cost estimated to be over Rs 450 crores.

 At present, contractors are involved in three stages. Placing bins at housing societies is done by one contractor, lifting garbage is the responsibility of another (the BMC too does this directly at some places) and disposal at dump yards is under yet another contractor. The fallout of this system is that it is hard to fix responsibility for improper work, as one contractor blames the other or all blame the BMC and vice versa.
 
 A BMC official said tenders for the new system were invited almost a year ago, in January 2017. “But owing to some technical issues, the prize bid was not opened. After a reevaluation, we have again invited tenders. The selected contractor will therefore be solely responsible for ensuring that waste reaches the dump,” he said.
 
  
 
 Recently, two of seven contractors responsible for the collection phase were given a show-cause notice for mixing debris with garbage.
