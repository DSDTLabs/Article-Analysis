JAIPUR: Commerce and industry minister   on Monday exuded confidence that BJP would gain in the UP assembly elections and the Central government’s decision of demonetisation will play a positive role.

 “BJP has tasted victory in the elections held after demonetisation, be it by-elections or local bodies polls. It will also be a crucial factor in the UP elections and BJP will gain victory,” Sitharaman told reporters here.
 
 The minister was in the city to inaugurate India-CLMV Business conclave.
 
 At another event in the city on Monday, BJP national vice president and state in-charge   claimed that the Opposition cannot target his party on corruption as it works on “value-based politics”.
 
 People of this country know that those representing them have clear intentions and the Centre under the leadership of Prime Minister   has come up with various schemes keeping the poor in mind, he said on the concluding day of the party’s four-day Pandit   here.
 
 National joint general secretary (organisation) V Satish said such training camps are helpful in strengthening the organisation and should be conducted from time to time.
 
 State BJP Chief   said that none of the parties organise such training camps.
 
 “This reveals the position of those parties which were once at their zenith and also of the parties which were nowhere,” he said.
