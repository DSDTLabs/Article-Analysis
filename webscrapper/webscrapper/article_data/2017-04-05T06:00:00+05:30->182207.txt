An adaptation of the much-acclaimed   play,   was staged by a city theatre group at   recently. The plot follows two hitmen in a tiny dark basement, while wondering who their victim will be tonight. They squabble over semantics of phrase, ‘light the kettle’ and ‘light the gas’ and as their irrational arguments become more heated, they are puzzled by random food orders by a dumb waiter.   as niggling Gus and   as the bossy Ben tried their best to deliver humour, we were left craving for more with respect to the subtleties that Pinter intended to convey through these characters.
