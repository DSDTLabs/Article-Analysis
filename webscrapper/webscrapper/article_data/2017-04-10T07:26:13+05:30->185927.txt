CHENNAI: The online mode of the Joint Entrance Exam Main, which concluded on Sunday, was not as long as the pen-and-paper version, with students by and large saying the test was moderate and well-balanced across its three sections.

 The entrance exam to engineering seats in the coveted IITs and other public institutions was conducted by the CBSE in 330 centres across 113 cities in the country on Saturday and Sunday. Students heaved a sigh of relief as it was relatively easier than last week's written paper which had a calculation-heavy maths section.
 
 “The students felt that the distribution of questions across chapters was uniform, and that they could do better than the previous year's papers they had practised on,“ said  , deputy centre head,  . “The chemistry section could have been easier. It was very fact-based and more time-consuming,“ said  , a student of   who gave the online paper on Saturday .
 
 The only glitch in the process was that students had to wait outside the exam centres for hours before they were let in.While the three-hour paper was slotted for 9.30am, students were advised to arrive as early as 7am.
 
 “I brought my son to the centre by 8.45am. But some had come as early as 6am. Everyone had to wait in the hot sun until the gates were open. That was a big inconvenience,“ Krishnaveni Kumar, a parent, said.
