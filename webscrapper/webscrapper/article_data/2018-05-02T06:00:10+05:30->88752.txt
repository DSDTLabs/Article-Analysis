NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has filed the   in the murder of west Delhi-based vlogger and   Ankit Saxena, who was hacked to death by the family of the girl he was in love with. A woman whom the girl’s mother had bitten while attacking the victim is one of the witnesses in the case, apart from the owner of the paan shop where the incident took place.

 The probe has found that the girl’s uncle and juvenile brother had instigated her family members to eliminate Saxena after they had confronted him to find the whereabouts of the girl. Even as the girl’s parents were arguing with Saxena about the whereabouts of the girl, the uncle had asked her juvenile brother to get the butcher’s knife, which was used for the murder. The juvenile brought the knife from a bed box in their house.
 
 Police have filed a separate report against the minor brother before the Juvenile Justice Board. The adult accused are in judicial custody in Tihar Jail. TOI had earlier reported that the family was charged under Sections 302 (murder), 323 (causing hurt) and 34 (common intention) under the IPC. Police have sought maximum punishment for the accused. The around 500-page chargesheet was filed at the Tis Hazari Courts. The girl’s statement under Section 164 CrPC has been mentioned in the chargesheet as well. Cops, however, have not put it up as evidence.
 
 Other witnesses include Saxena’s parents who had taken him to hospital after the assault, the paan shop owner who witnessed the attack outside his shop and two friends of Saxena, who were present at the spot. The investigators have established the presence of the accused at the murder spot via their call detail records and CCTV and phone footage recorded by onlookers.
 
 CCTV footage recovered from a nearby shop moments before Saxena was murdered showed him (in a black pullover and slippers) frantically calling someone on his phone after being beaten up.
