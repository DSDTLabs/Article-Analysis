SHIMLA: Following up the growing feud among Congress leaders in  , after six party MLAs wrotes to the party high command seeking removal of chief minister Virbhadra Singh for mishandling the Shimla rape-murder case, the latter met Congress vice-president   in New Delhi on Tuesday, demanding the removal of state party president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu. Flanked by several cabinet ministers and chief parliamentary secretaries, Virbhadra did not give his choice for the new state president, leaving it to   Gandhi to decide on it.

 With just a few months left for the assembly election, factionalism has intensified in the state unit of Congress. A war of words between Virbhadra and Sukhu has been going on for quite some time. Transport minister G S Bali too has differences with the CM.
 
 A senior leader from Virbhadra camp said the chief minister apprised Rahul Gandhi about the situation prevailing in the state unit and how some Congress leaders including those in the government are pursuing the BJP agenda by issuing damaging statements against their own party. Virbhadra also informed Rahul Gandhi about weak organizational set up in the state, the leader added.
 
 “We have not given out choice of new state president and have left the decision on Rahul Gandhi,” said another leader.
 
 Recently, six MLAs had written to the party command against Virbhadra. Though Sukhu was also present in Delhi, but he is supposed to meet Rahul separately.
 
 Virbhadra loyalists claimed that in the meeting, which lasted for around 30 minutes, Rahul Gandhi has made it clear that the coming assembly election in the state would be contested under the leadership of Virbhadra.
 
 Sources said newly-appointed Congress in-charge for Himachal Pradesh Sushil Kumar Shinde would visit Shimla on August 1 and 2 to hold meetings with the state government and party.
