1. Assessment of groundwater quality in landfill area of Nagpur city, Central India

 Authors: Deepali Marghade, DB Malpe and AB Zade, published in the Journal of Environmental Hydrology in 2010
 
 About the study: To assess the quality of groundwater near   dumping site
 
 Methodology: Water from specific dugwells and borewells which were continuously used by residents was selected for sampling. The pH and electrical conductivity of water was measured on site
 
 Observations
 
 * Waste generated: About 30% of the city’s municipal waste is organic compostable material. The remaining waste constitutes of paper (11.9%), rubber, leather and synthetics (3.02%), glass (0.98%), metals (0.33%) and other inert material (53%)
 
 * Not one water sample safe for drinking
 
 - Value of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in all samples was more than the safe limit of 500 milligrams per litre
 
 - Alkalinity of water was   which can be harmful to human health 
 
 - Total hardness of water varied from 55 to 1490 mg/l. The maximum allowable limit for drinking purpose is 500 mg/l and most desirable limit is 100 mg/l as per the World Health Organisation. Groundwater exceeding the limit of 300 mg/l is considered to be very hard and may cause calcification of arteries, urinary concretions and other diseases related to kidney, bladder or stomach 
 
 - As the distance of sampling sites from landfill increased, the value of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) decreased 
 
 Conclusion:
 
 - Strong evidence of groundwater contamination
 
 - About 77% of groundwater samples have high nitrate values and are unsuitable for drinking
 
 - Chloride concentrations very high
 
 - In 38.5% of samples, manganese above the safe limit
 
 - In almost half of the samples, iron concentration above the permissible value suggested by  
 
 - To protect groundwater quality of the area, monitoring programme around the vicinity of landfill should be done
 
 - Before setting-up a new landfill site, a buffer zone of 2-3 miles in the direction of groundwater flow should be maintained

 About the study: To find out the adverse effect of solid waste disposal on residential locality
 
 Observations: 
 
 - When rainwater falls on the dumping site, it first percolates through the waste and gets contaminated layer-by-layer
 
 - By the time rainwater finally reaches the ground, it gets highly contaminated and is called ‘leachate’
 
 - The leachate then gets mixed up with groundwater, making it impure
 
 - Approximately 3,000 families live within a proximity of 500 meters from the dumping yard
 
 - Most of the residents are dependent on groundwater sources like wells and borewells for drinking, bathing and cooking
 
 - As the leachate has contaminated groundwater of the area, their health is at a high risk
 
 Toxicities seeping inside water:
 
 - Solid waste contains many hazardous materials like chemicals extracted from hospitals and industries
 
 - Due to poor waste management, these hazardous elements are penetrating in the groundwater
 
 - When rainfall occurs, the intensity of groundwater contamination is more 
 
 Suggestions:
 
 - As health of thousands of people is at risk, it is important to frequently analyse the quality of groundwater
 
 - Proper disposal of waste should be done urgently
 
 - Preventive measures should be taken to minimize the effect of contaminated groundwater on the residents
 
 3. Analysis of contamination of groundwater due to dump yard
 
 About the study: To find the impact of water pollution
 
 Methodology: Five settlements near the dumping site were chosen, one groundwater source was selected and water samples were analysed for physical and chemical characteristics. Mainly, three parameters were analysed: pH, nitrate and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).

 Findings:
 
 1. pH: Were within permissible limits but very close to it; Was highest at Abbumiya Nagar and was only less than the permissible value by 0.1 unit; Indicates that the region is highly susceptible to contamination; Drinking water with high pH can cause skin, eye and mucous membrane irritation
 
 2. Nitrate: Was high, though less than the permissible limit, it was still quite close; Value increases during rains; At Antuji Nagar, which is 100 meters away from the dumping site, value was 37.21 mg/l, which is very high; Decreased as one moves away from the dumping site; High levels can cause ‘blue baby’ disease
 
 3. BOD: High levels indicates water pollution; As per the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the value should be 0; In all five samples, BOD was higher than the safe limit — 2.8 to 3.8 mg/l.
 
 Conclusion: Water samples fail to meet the standard parameters for drinking specified by the Indian government. Groundwater is highly contaminating day-by-day due to leachate percolation and necessary action needs to be take to stop water pollution
