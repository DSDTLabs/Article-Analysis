CHANDIGARH: The   has directed real-estate developer   to refund Rs 18 lakh and pay Rs 1 lakh as compensation to a Sector 8 for delay in giving   of a shop he had bought.

 The company has been asked to pay a 12% interest per year, starting from 2009, on the Rs 18 lakh, and another Rs 33,000 as cost of litigation. In all, the company will have to pay nearly Rs 20 lakh.
 
  The complainant, Munish Gohri, said in his complaint that he applied for buying a shop at   in Sector 115, Mohali, and paid Rs 18 lakh for it in 2009. At the time the deal was struck, the complainant was informed that the shop’s possession would be given to him in 24-30 months.
 
 He claimed that while the shop’s possession was never given to him, the developer issued a letter intimating him that the area of his shop had been increased from 556.35 square feet to 565 square feet.
 
  He said though he kept asking for the possession of the plot and visited the company’s on several occasions from February 2010 to July 2016, a new staff member welcomed him every time with a new excuse and showed ignorance about the completion of the project.
 
 In their reply, the company said it was not responsible for the “inordinate delay”, saying that it was out of its control. 
 
 It said the partial completion certificate was issued by   municipal council on October 14, 2016, but there had been a delay in obtaining the completion certificate from the   government, without which possession could not be offered to the complainant. 
 
 It said the Clause 23 of the allotment letter dated November 3, 2009, clearly mentioned that the actual possession of the property was agreed to be handed over to the allottee after receipt of completion certificate.
 
 It said the delay happened due to delay on part of authorities in issuing completion certification. 
 
 The company said the complainant was issued an allotment letter on November 3, 2009, and the possession was to be offered on November 2, 2012, so he should have filed the complaint within two years. However, the forum rejected the company’s plea and directed it to refund the complainant.
