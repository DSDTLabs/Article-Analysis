AHMEDABAD/GANDHINAGAR: The   on Thursday announced in the assembly the setting up of a commission of inquiry for the Naliya sex scandal. The probe panel will be headed by former justice of  ,  . 

  The state government had recently agreed to a probe by a retired   after the Congress and the leader of opposition Shankersinh Vaghela demanded a inquiry by a sitting or a retired judge. The Congress had even taken out a rally from Kutch to Gandhinagar. The Naliya scandal is sensitive as it involves   leaders from Kutch.
 
 Meanwhile, the Forum of Concerned Citizens for Naliya Incident (FCCNI), said that even after two months of the FIR filed by a rape survivor in Naliya taluka of Kutch district, there had been poor investigation into the incident. The forum, which has been formed to ensure speedy justice in the case, questioned police inaction in the matter.
 
 “Even after some culprits were arrested and a special investigation team (SIT) formed, there was no concrete action in the matter,” said Meenakshi Joshi, a representative of the forum. “Another team formed to oversee the functioning of the SIT has neither been active nor responsive. The remaining two culprits mentioned in the FIR are yet to be arrested.” 
 
 One of the key issues raised by the forum was about the CD containing evidence which is reportedly in the possession of senior Congress leader, Shankersinh Vaghela. “The evidence must be submitted in court. Moreover, based on the announcement made in the assembly regarding a judicial inquiry, a fresh announcement must be made to include the case of 35 other women who were exploited by the culprits,” Joshi said.
 
 Representatives of the forum also emphasized the fact that the survivor is yet to get financial assistance from the government. The forum has also alleged harassment of the complainant by the policemen who had recorded her statement. In fact, the complainant was not even given a copy of the statement.
