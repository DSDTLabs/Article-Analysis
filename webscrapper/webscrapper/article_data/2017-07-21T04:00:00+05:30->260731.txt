Surat: At least 60 drivers of Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) buses of a contractor went on a flash strike for a wage hike here on Thursday. However, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials got in touch with the other contractor and ensured uninterrupted bus services on the three affected routes too.

 BRTS bus contract has been given by SMC to two contractors. SMC also runs its city buses for the people. Drivers of Adinath Bulk Carriers that runs 48 buses on three routes of BRTS went on a flash strike in the morning. 
 
 Around 45,000 passengers, who travel on a daily basis in buses on Surat-Utran, Sura-Kamrej and Gajera Circle to Dindoli routes, were inconvenienced by the strike of the drivers who want a wage hike, permission not to wear seat belts, professional tax receipts, stopping other vehicles from using BRTS lane etc. 
 
 SMC authorities immediately ensured by taking help of the other contractor that people were not stranded and ran buses on all the routes. They also summoned Adinath Bulk Carrier management and told them to find a solution to the problem at the earliest. 
 
 “The bus contractor assured us that the buses would start running on all the routes by late evening. The notorious drivers are being replaced with new ones by the management. The drivers, who are demanding a wage hike, were hired only six months ago by the management,” an officer of SMC said. 
 
 A driver, who struck work said, “Our demands are very small. We want clear BRTS roads, permission not to wear seat belt etc, respectful behaviour of policemen towards drivers and receipt of Rs200 professional tax deducted from our salaries.” 
 
 The daily ridership in 120 BRTS buses that ply on nine routes in the city is around 90,000.
