HYDERABAD: At a time when the state's unemployed youths are battling for jobs, those already employed with the directorate of   (DME) are on the verge of launching agitations. This is because their posts and promotions are being cornered by Andhra Pradesh-origin doctors.

 The Kamalnathan committee dumped 171 AP-origin doctors in city-based medical teaching colleges run by the government, in its final allocation list released on January 25, after two years of bifurcation exercise. What has angered the   Government Doctors' Association (TGDA) more is the fact that out of 26   origin doctors allotted to their native state, 16 have managed to stay back in their respective teaching hospitals here by obtaining stay orders from the courts. “The net gain after two ye ars of Kamalnathan committee's employees' distribution work between AP and Telangana is almost zero,“ rued Dr B Narahari, vice-president, TGDA.
 
 Not surprisingly , the futile exercise left the bulk of AP doctors untouched as they continued to stay back in Telangana after the Kamalnathan committee allowed them the advantage of section 18 (f) of Kamalnathan guidelines. The controversial provision ­ which has been a bone of contention since the clause was adopted ­ gives an option to AP origin doctors to stay back in the state of their choice.
 
 “In spite of our strong objections, 171 plus 16 other doctors who managed to obtain stay orders from court, were finally allocated to Telangana by the centre. This will cause irreparable damage to T doctors in future promotions and employment,“ said Dr P Praveen, president, TGDA, in a representation to Telangana state health minister Dr C Laxma Reddy .
 
 “Whether we will just protest or go on strike will be declared after the general body meeting,“ said Dr  , state secretary general, TGDA.
