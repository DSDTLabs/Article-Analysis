HYDERABAD: Ahead of the   (April 24 –April 30), experts highlight the need to raise awareness about adult vaccination, which is critically low in twin states of   and Telangana.

 With age, the immunity system undergoes changes-‘Immunosenescence’- which makes it more prone to infections. Such infections last for a long period, recur frequently and lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality. “Many adults also have co-morbid conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and liver disease, all of which make them more susceptible to certain infections. Vaccination against deadly diseases is therefore needed to save adults as well. By the time adults gain awareness of the need for vaccination, they cross the age of 50 years,” said Dr VV  , senior consultant chest physician and intervention pulmonologist, KIMS Hospitals.
 
 Meanwhile, vaccination is one of the most effective tools to prevent disease and death from infectious diseases such as pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, bronchitis and invasive pneumococcal disease, bacteremic pneumonia and meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. “Many of these infections can be life threatening,” added Dr Prasad.
 
 Also vaccination is recommended for influenza (annual) vaccine, herpes zoster against herpes or shingles, Tdap (combined tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine) vaccine and Tetanus vaccine for protection against a common bacteria.
 
 Most of these vaccines come in booster doses that have to be taken a week to five months apart. They can last for three to five years at a stretch.
 
 “There is no age to take these vaccines and some people start at the age of 18. In most cases of viral fevers the vaccines confer over 90 per cent immunity if the booster doses are taken properly. In case of diseases like typhoid and malaria the immunity that the vaccine provides might be slightly less,” said Dr  , general physician,   hospitals.
