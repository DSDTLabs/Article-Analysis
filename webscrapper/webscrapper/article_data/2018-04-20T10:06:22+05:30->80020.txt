TRICHY: Four unidentified men robbed Rs 1 lakh and a gold chain at a   shop near   on Wednesday night. 

 Police said that the four men, who had allegedly covered their faces, arrived at the Tasmac situated on the Perambalur - Ariyalur Road near   in two bikes. Since it was around 10pm, the salesman at the Tasmac, Senthilkumar, was about to close the shop. 
 
 One of the masked men barged into the Tasmac and threatened the salesman at knifepoint to hand over the money lying in the cash counter. Shocked and scared, Senthilkumar handed over cash of Rs 1 lakh to him. 
 
 At the same time, another masked man also came into the Tasmac and threatened the only customer, Devendran and snatched a gold chain from him.
 
 The two men immediately ran outside and fled the spot on the bikes in which their friends were waiting.
 
 Based on a complaint given by Senthilkumar, Maruvathur police personnel visited the spot, conducted investigation and are on the lookout for the four.
