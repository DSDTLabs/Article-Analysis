Tirupur: Farmers in the district have raised concern about the illegal tapping of water from the Parambikulam-Aliyar Irrigation Project (PAP) while their counterparts in Kerala are staging protests seeking supply of their share of water from Aliyar dam. The farmers,  , urged the district administration to form a special monitoring committee to curb the illegal tapping.

 They alleged that a section of farmers were involved in the over-exploitation on Aliyar-Manakadavu and Arasur-Vavipalayam stretches in Coimbatore and Tirupur districts. 
 
 As many as 1.74 hectares of agricultural lands were commanded in PAP in Coimbatore and Tirupur districts. Apart from this, 7.5tmc should be supplied to Kerala from Aliyar dam. 
 
 “More than 1,000 electrical motors were illegally installed in various places along PAP canals to tap water. For instance on Aliyar-Manakadavu stretch, through which water would be supplied to Kerala, at least 30% of 400mcft, the daily share for the neighbouring state farmers, would be tapped illegally,” said P Somasundaram, Tirupur district president, Youth wing of Uzhavar Uzhaippalar Katchi (UUK).
 
 Many farmers have bought small pieces of lands alongside of PAP main canals and erected bore wells, and take water to their farms located in farer places. Many farmers have even encroached few places along Thirumurthy reservoir for the same illegal purposes, said SR Madhusudhanan, another farmer.
 
 If the situation continued, it will derail the irrigation scheme as it would become impossible to provide water to the farms in the tail end of the project. But the public works department (PWD) authorities were not taking action against the violators, Madhusudhanan added.
 
 When collector KS Palanisamy, who chaired the grievance meeting questioned, a senior PWD official replied that they have served notices to many farmers who were involved in the illegal tapping.
