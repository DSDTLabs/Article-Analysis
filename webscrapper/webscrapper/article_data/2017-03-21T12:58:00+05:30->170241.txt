HYDERABAD: The   ( ) on Monday conveyed to the   two names of retired judges, one from the Supreme Court and the other from the Hyderabad High Court, urging it to appoint either or both of them as administrators to the   ( ). The HC said the names were acceptable to it and reserved its orders.

 BCCI counsel   Reddy conveyed this decision in a sealed cover to a bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther hearing a PIL by advocate M Govind Reddy seeking reforms in HCA. 
 
 But counsel B Vijaysen Reddy, arguing for HCA secretary John Manoj, was critical of BCCI and accused it of starving cricket bodies of funds. He said that if BCCI were to release money for salaries to the staff they would be able to conduct the IPL season smoothly. Refuting the charge, Priyadarshan said BCCI had released money to cricket bodies in various states but could not give it to HCA as they failed to furnish details of vendors. 
 
 Urging the court to appoint the judges as administrators and not mere observers, the BCCI counsel said that this was essential to make HCA implement the reforms suggested by the  . “We are not asking the court to abolish the existing managing committee, but to bring in fiscal discipline,” Priyadarshan said. The bench too agreed and said: “How the money should be spent and how to prioritise it are areas that are better left to the administrators.”
 
 In a separate development, the petition on declaration of results of election to the executive body of HCA, which had been stayed earlier, would be heard by Justice S V Bhatt on Tuesday.
