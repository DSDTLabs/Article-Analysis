BENGALURU: A sexual harassment complaint filed by a 31-year-old woman against two youngsters backfired on her when   police confronted her with a   footage retrieved from a nearby shop and reprimanded her for filing a false case.

 The woman, a private company staffer and a resident of Ejipura, had parked her car on the crowded   Main Road on January 24 when four bike-borne youngsters hurried to take their injured friend to a clinic for treatment.
 
 As her car was causing a traffic congestion they reportedly told her to move aside and make way for other vehicles. The woman had taken objection to it and a verbal argument broke out between them.
 
 Two traffic policemen rushed to the spot and ordered the woman not to block traffic and told the youngsters to leave the place.
 
 But in her complaint, the woman had alleged: “The four did not leave the spot and the cops did nothing. When I was heading towards the police station, they followed me in the car and made obscene signs.”
 
 Based on her complaint, Viveknagar police commenced investigation and retrieved a video clip from the   installed in a building where the alleged incident took place. After analyzing the video and recording statements from local residents, police concluded that the woman had made false allegations.
 
 “We also traced two of the bike-borne youngsters and recorded their statement. They told us that their friend Immanuel was injured after an accident at   area a few minutes before the incident. They were taking him to nearby clinic for the treatment when they found the road being blocked by the woman’s car,” a police officer said.
 
 We checked with the clinic and the doctors confirmed that Immanuel was treated there. In fact, the woman was found to have continued with her verbal argument instead of giving way to other motorists,” added the officer.
 
 Police claimed to have closed the case after issuing a warning to the woman.
