VELLORE: After the 84 suspected TN red sander smugglers, arrested near Tirupati during the early hours of Friday by the   Anti-Smuggling Task Force (RSASTF), were released on   on Saturday, the Tamil Nadu government arranged transport facility for them to help them reach their respective villages.

 Officials said that the 84 men, hailing from Vellore and Tiruvannamalai, were brought to Vellore in two state transport buses. Revenue and Adi Dravidar welfare officers from both the districts received the men at the Vellore-Chittoor border. 
 
 “We provided them with food and sent them to their villages,” said an official, who is part of the Vellore district administration.
 
 Of the 42 from Vellore district, four were from Penjamanthai in Anaicut taluk and the remaining were from the tribal villages of Pudurnadu on   that falls under Tirupattur taluk.
 
 Similarly, the other 42 men were from Jawadhu Hills in Jamunamaruthur taluk and they were ferried in a separate bus to their destination.
 
 Acting on a tip-off, the task force personnel conducted a vehicle check at Anjaneyapuram forest check post near Tirupati during the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. 
 
 They stopped the lorry in which the men were being ferried. They also seized axes (without handle), sickles and rice bags from them.
