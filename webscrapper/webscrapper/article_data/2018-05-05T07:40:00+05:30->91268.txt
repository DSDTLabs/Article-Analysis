CHANDIGARH: In another jolt to   ( ) chief  , the Supreme Court (SC) on Friday dismissed his appeal against the Punjab and Haryana high court orders allowing his former driver Khatta Singh to depose afresh before the special   court in Panchkula in two murder cases.

 With this, the April 23 orders passed by Justice Augustine George Masih of the HC has attained finality and Khatta Singh would be able to record his statements afresh in murder cases of Sirsa based journalist Ramchander Chattarpati and former dera manager Ranjit Singh. He would record his statements before special CBI judge   on Saturday.
 
 Division bench comprising Justice A K Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan of the apex court passed these orders while dismissing the dera chief’s plea against April 23 orders.
 
 While allowing Khatta Singh to depose again before the CBI court in relation to the murder cases, Justice Masih was of the view that he had recorded his previous statement in February, 2012, when the dera chief prospered. 
 
 “With this political clout, following increased influence and financial strength, sense of insecurity amongst the people like the petitioner (Khatta) cannot be ruled out and, in these circumstances, it cannot be said that he would not have been influenced with the changed circumstances, especially when the dera chief had devoted followers who would kill or die on his command, which is reflected, as per the assertions of the petitioner, on the killing of Ranjit Singh and Ram Chander Chhatarpati of which he is a witness,” HC had observed.
 
 Khatta Singh had approached the HC against the orders of special CBI court Panchkula that had dismissed his plea to depose against the DSS chief in murder cases. According to him, he has personal knowledge about the commission of crime and circumstances which led to the murder of Ranjit Singh and Ram Chander Chhatarpati. Earlier, he had turned hostile but after the DSS chief’s conviction in rape cases in August last year, he had approached to record his statement afresh.
