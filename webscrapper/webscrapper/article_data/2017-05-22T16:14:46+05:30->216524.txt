CHENNAI:   president   has said that the party would welcome actor  , but that the superstar has to first decide to enter politics.

 Speaking at an India Today TV event in New Delhi on Sunday, Shah responded to a query on the growing speculation surrounding the superstar’s entry into politics. To a question on whether Rajinikanth will join the BJP, Shah said only the actor has to decide that. “When he has to enter politics, how can I decide that? From our end, every good person is welcome to join politics,” he said.
 
 Denying he had a conversation with Rajinikanth on the issue, Shah added that the actor must first decide to take the plunge into politics. Shah said one could speculate “only when Rajinikanth decides to enter politics” and that the actor has to decide first, whether or not he wants to take the plunge.
 
 On reports that the actor might meet PM Naredra Modi soon, Shah said, “Thousands of people come to meet Modiji. Good people working in every sector meet Modiji and they should meet.”
 
 Last week, on the final day of his five-day interaction with fans, Rajinikanth reiterated his Tamil identity and gave a strong political colour to his speech. The actor called for cleaning up the political system and exhorted fans to “prepare for a battle” if necessary.
 
 On Sunday, TN Congress committee president S Thirunavukkarasar told reporters that he believes Rajinikanth will not join any party but will only float his own organisation. “As a friend who has known him for 35-40 years what I think is he will not join any national or regional party. He will only float a new party,” he said.
 
 Last week, Rajinikanth had said he had no political aspirations but will consider taking the plunge if “God wills”.
 
 He also said he would shun “money-minded people”.
