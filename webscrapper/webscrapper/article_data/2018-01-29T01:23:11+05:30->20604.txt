Mumbai: In a shocking case of medical negligence, a 32-year-old man was sucked into an MRI machine and killed after he entered the room holding an oxygen cylinder at a hospital in Mumbai, according to Times Now. The victim, Rajesh Maru, was holding the cylinder for an elderly relative who was admitted to Nair Hospital and was helping her to get a scan when the machine's massive magnetic force sucked him in, fatally injuring him. No metal objects are usually allowed inside an MRI room at hospitals. While the family has blamed the hospital for negligence, hospital authorities have reportedly suspended a ward boy involved in the case.  Police registered an FIR against doctor Siddhant Shah, ward boy Vitthal Chavan and one lady ward attendant Sunita Surve under Section 304 A (causing death by negligence) in connection with the case. All three of them were later detained at Agripada police station.  On the other hand, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the victim's kin. The incident occurred at 8:30 pm on Saturday evening, when the family was waiting for a doctor outside the MRI room. The victim's kin alleged that a ward boy asked Maru to enter room with the oxygen cylinder. When the family questioned if he could step inside the room with a metal object, the ward boy is said to have dismissed their doubts by saying, “Sab chalta hai, hamara roz ka kaam hai,(it's fine, we do it every day).”tnn
