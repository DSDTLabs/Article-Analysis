BENGALURU: In a swift move, Karnataka chief minister   on Thursday ordered a high-level inquiry into allegations that special facilities were being provid ed to jailed   leader VK   following payment of a Rs 2-crore bribe to senior officers of the prisons department and that authorities had turned a blind eye to drug trafficking inside Parappana Agrahara jail.

 Law minister TB Jayachandra has sought a report from the home secretary. The probe came on a letter submitted by deputy inspector general of police (prisons) D Roopa to DGP (prisons) HN Sathyanarayana Rao. Roopa alleged that Sasikala, who is serving a sentence in the jail, had been given a special kitchen and other facilities by the prison staff. Abdul Karim Telgi, convicted in the stamp paper scam, was provided undertrials as aides, she said. The DIG also accused the prison administration of failing to check the flow of drugs in the jail.
 
 Roopa's report, contested by Rao, set off a war of words among senior officers and also created a furore in   as DMK and other par ties attacked the AIADMK government. The  , too, blamed chief minister Siddaramaiah, who holds the home portfolio, for the alleged poor state of prisons in Karnataka. With the issue snowballing into a controversy, the chief minister controlled the damage by ordering a probe into the allegations.
