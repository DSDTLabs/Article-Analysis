 Backed by the directions given by the prime accused Man Mohan, the search operation was carried out by two teams of cops. “One team looked into the forest area of the Morni, while the other -- with the help of a   machine — dug at various places at the open drainage located on the backside of CTU workshop,” the cops said.
 
 Apparently, it was the same place where cops had earlier found the deceased’s sari and the rope that was used to strangulate her.
 
 Sources said Man Mohan was only wasting time by constantly changing his statements.
 
 As per the case, Man Mohan’s alleged lover,  , confessed that she had committed the crime with him and her brother-in-law Sandeep Gill on January 16.
 
 She told cops that they strangled Monika in a moving car. All three were taken into custody on January 25. Monika told the cops that the   was pre-planned.
 
 The police arrested Man Mohan on the statements given by two of his co-accused. Despite this, the cops have completely failed to find any clue that could lead them to dead body.
 
 Family members of the deceased, on the other hand, are outraged over the entire incident, including the missing dead body. They had earlier tried to thrash Man Mohan when the cops produce him before a court five days ago.
 
 The cops have time till 2 pm on Thursday after which they have to produce the accused in the court. The court may send the accused to a judicial custody if the cops fail to find the body of the victim.
