PATNA: Chief minister   on Thursday lashed out at opposition parties for criticising   policy, saying the stance was “anti-poor” since the economically deprived sections of the society suffered the most on account of alcoholism. “There are people who are angry with me because of obvious reasons. They are welcome to do so. They may even try to destroy me if it makes them happy. But it is my request, for heaven’s sake do not start opposing prohibition just because you want to oppose me,”   said while addressing a function to mark the second anniversary of total prohibition in the state.

 The CM did not name any party, though his comment was an obvious reference to the recent stance adopted by RJD, which has been terming the state’s prohibition law as “draconian” and promising to amend the same if it is voted to power.
 
 Moreover, former CM and HAM-S chief  , who recently moved to the   camp, has been all through opposed to the ban on liquor, saying it deprived the Mahadalits of their source of livelihood.
 
 In a veiled attack on leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Nitish said, “Some people have no understanding of any issue but they love to keep tweeting all through the day. I am often accused of being responsible for such figures getting into limelight. Perhaps, I am gullible”
