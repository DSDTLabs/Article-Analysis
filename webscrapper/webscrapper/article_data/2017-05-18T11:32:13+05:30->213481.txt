PUNE: In  , a town in Konkan’s Sindhudurg district, garbage is segregated into 23 different categories and every of bit of trash is processed. The town sees no open dumping of garbage. In fact, the dumping ground has been turned into a recreation centre. 

 Over time, Vengurla has achieved the feat of managing its own garbage in a sustainable manner and is even earning money from processing trash. What Pune could not do in the last 25, the seaside town managed to achieve in just two years, thanks to unity among citizens, civic officials and politicians.
 
 Ramdas Kokare, chief officer of  , points out that garbage segregation has turned into a high priority task. “Two years ago, the movement started with a few people and officials. We faced strong opposition when we decided to impose a fine on households that failed to segregate garbage,” Kokare told TOI. 
 
 As the civic body started imposing fine, politicians did oppose the move but, eventually, they too approved the administration’s initiative. “We segregate wet and dry garbage and then divide it into 23 categories like paper, plastic, glass, electronic waste, dry leaves, clothes, etc. Processed garbage is used in various ways. We sell scrap material, wet garbage is used in the biogas plant to generate electricity, vermicompost is sold in the market,” explained Kokare.
 
 Further, the use of plastic, less than 50 microns in thickness, is banned in Vengurla. The civic body reuses plastic required for packaging, water bottles, etc., by crushing it into granules that are mixed with tar to construct roads.
 
 “Smaller towns, like Vengurla, have done excellent work but Pune’s civic body has not been able to solve the garbage problem. It is a matter of commitment and sincerity,” said Dilip Mehta, who heads the environment committee at   village.
