CHENNAI: Directorate of   ( ) sleuths on Wednesday night arrested a Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) district president after discovering that his car was carrying 11.9kg of smuggled gold bars worth Rs 3.58 crore.

 Officers said the gold was from Sri Lanka.
 
 DRI officers picked up Congress president of Ramanathapuram district S Rajendran, also known as ‘Goodluck’ Rajendran, from his house in Royappetah on Wednesday night.
 
 Sources said the portly politician, who weighs around 100kg, made a frantic attempt to evade arrest but, in the process, fell and broke a bone in his left shoulder. After receiving medical attention in a hospital, officers presented Rajendran before a magistrate who sent him to Puzhal Central Prison, his arm in a sling.
 
 “The authorities had earlier arrested and imprisoned Rajendran in a case under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (Fera),” a DRI officer said.
 
 DRI officers intercepted Rajendran’s car (TN 07 BQ8485) on the Pudukottai-Trichy highway on Wednesday morning. When the officers questioned the driver and searched the vehicle, they found 119 gold bars with foreign markings weighing 11.9 kg concealed in a compartment of the vehicle.
 
 The driver, K Gandhi, confessed to the sleuths, who seized the gold and car under the Customs Act, that the vehicle and the consignment of gold belonged to Rajendran.
 
 Officers said the driver revealed that smugglers had brought the gold to the country from Sri Lanka by sea, their boat landing near Thondi in Ramanathapuram district.
 
 “Gandhi testified that Rajendran had instructed him to bring the gold to the city by car,” a DRI officer said. “He has been an employee of Rajendran for the past 20 years.”
 
 The politician has several business interests, including ventures in prawn farming and mineral water bottling, the officer said.
 
 After arresting Rajendran, DRI sleuths said they found “incriminating evidence” of illegal activities on his cellphones and from other sources.
