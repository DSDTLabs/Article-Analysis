BHOPAL: A three-minute film on cleanliness in   has been nominated for the   award.

 ‘Swacch Bharat’ — the film is made by Rashmi Jeta, an associate professor of history in a government college in Damoh. In a   list released two years ago, the city was given the tag of the dirtiest in nation.
 
 “After Damoh was identified as the dirtiest place in India, I was made one of the brand ambassadors for the city by Jayant Malaiya, the finance minister. I decided to create awareness through media”, Jeta said.
 
 Jeta’s film was also given the award for excellence by the Union Ministry of information and broadcasting.
 
 With a budget of only Rs 5,000, the film is directed and written by Jeta. A camera person from Damoh, Narendra Athaiya, helped with the shooting and Manish Soni, a media person worked as an anchor.
 
 “Though our city was tagged the dirtiest, I wanted to show that it is not the case,” Jeta said, adding, “Gandgi garibi mein nahi agyanta k andhkar mein failti hai” (Dirt is not spread due to poverty but ignorance). There is a need to change the mind-set of the people. The film tries to show a contrast between popular belief and reality by showing clean slum areas and the well to do places heaped with garbage, putting across the point that cleanliness is not synonymous with wealth.
 
 A Ranji trophy cricketer, Jeta is from Bihar, and he now works in Damoh. His film on the “dirtiest city in the country” has been nominated with 19 other films from across the country.
 
 Swachh Bharat will be screened in Mumbai on April 30 at the Dadasaheb Phalke film festival.
