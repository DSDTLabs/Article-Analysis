KOCHI: The high   said that action taken by the state government in removing vehicles seized by   and kept along roadside was unsatisfactory.

 A division bench comprising chief justice   and justice   expressed displeasure over the steps taken by the government while considering three public interest litigations (WP-C Nos. 24734, 25102, and 35252 of 2017) alleging failure by the government in removing vehicles, thereby leading to traffic congestion and accidents.
 
 Based on the assurance given to the court that adequate action will be taken, the government had issued an order on March 28 this year for removing vehicles. However, the court said in an interim order that “We are disappointed to see that an ineffective order has been issued by the government.” The order only deals with vehicles abandoned by owners and it does not take care of vehicles seized by authorities, the court pointed out.
 
 The court pointed out that a directive was issued to the chief secretary to take adequate action as early as on December 2, 2008 by the court. Through the order, the court had asked the chief secretary to convene a meeting of all departments and take steps to ensure that vehicles are not left in government custody for more than a month. The court had also warned of contempt action if its directive was not followed.
 
 In January 2009, the government issued an order directing the heads of all departments to dispose all seized or recovered vehicles by March 2009. Subsequently, another order was issued in December 2010 empowering superintendents of police and deputy SPs to fix fair value of seized vehicles. The said direction was repeated in two orders issued in April 2012 and July 2013.
 
 As the situation remained unchanged at the ground level, the present petitions were filed before the high court. In response, the government issued the order that dealt only with vehicles abandoned by owners.
