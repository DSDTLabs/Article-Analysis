RAJKOT: Two complaints of financial fraud totalling a little over Rs 2 lakh were lodged in the city.

 In the first case, complainant Gunvant Lunagaria (39), living on Kuvadawa Road, accused one Prisca   and three others of duping him of over Rs 1 lakh. 
 
 “Lunagaria came into contact with Prisca on  , who claimed to be a British national keen on visiting India. On November 24 last year, he got a call from another woman who said that Prisca had landed in Delhi airport but was detained by the customs officials as she had valuable gifts for him and that in order to release her and valuables that she had brought, he would have to pay. Believing the caller, he transferred Rs 36,000 in one account and Rs 1 lakh in the other account,” said the B-Division police. Later, Lunagaria found out that no such woman had arrived from the UK. The two accounts in which he had transferred the money were in the names of Dipali Shinde and H K C Annalal.
 
 In the second case,   (40) was duped of Rs 81,000 by Palm David, Hans Robinson and George Hellan, all residents of the UK who had promised him of getting him a job. They produced fake visa papers to win his confidence and vanished after siphoning off the money from him,” said a police official from Bhaktinagar station.
