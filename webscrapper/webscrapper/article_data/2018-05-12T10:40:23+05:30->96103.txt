JAIPUR: The Rajasthan police have directed all   officials to take action against drivers caught talking over the phone while driving. The order came after a divisional bench of   directed that driving licenses (DL) of such persons shall be cancelled.

 
 An order was issued by the Rajasthan police’s headquarters (PHQ) on May 1 to direct its traffic units across the state to comply with the high court’s orders, and obtain photographs of violators and forward their credentials to the regional transport office for the cancellation of driving license.
 
 The court had passed the order after the   (traffic) told the court that a large number of four and two-wheeler drivers used mobile phones while driving, which was not permissible under the law and caused accidents.
 
 The PHQ has also asked traffic units to provide a compliance report by May 15. The traffic units will send phots of violators to the concerned regional/ district transport offices for the cancellation of the DLs.
 
 The Jaipur traffic police however, have already sent 44 such DLs for cancellation to the regional transport office ( ). Sources told TOI that the city police had already launched the drive last year.
 
 “Talking over phone is one of the major reasons behind accidents. It takes the focus off the road and is considered as a major offence under the motor vehicle act ( ) we hope that this new order will help us control traffic accidents,” said the official.
 
 The Rajasthan police had earlier said that majority of accidents occur due to the mistake of drivers.
