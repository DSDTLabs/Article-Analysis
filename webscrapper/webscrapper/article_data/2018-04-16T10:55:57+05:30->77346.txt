LUDHIANA: City residents continued to show their support for justice to the Kathua rape and murder victim and   rape case, as they held two protest demonstrations for them in the city.

 In the first protest function organized by  , protestors burnt the effigies of the governments of Jammu and Kashmir and   in protest against the shocking incidents. Addressing the protestors, Shahi Imaam Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi demanded death sentence to the culprits of the two heinous crimes. He added: “The Mehbooba and Yogi governments should be ashamed of the fact that the accused in the cases were arrested after public outrage, and had that not happened, the savages would have roamed free.”
 
 The religious leader said it was unfortunate that in independent India, politicians were seeing victims on the basis of religion and sect. He added that he wanted to tell the   government — which made a law on ‘triple talaq’ —that in Islam, it was said rapists should be beheaded, so that no savage could destroy the lives of girls.
 
 Meanwhile, residents also took out a candle march from BCM Road to Model Town Market for justice to the eight-year-old nomad girl who was kidnapped and raped in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir. The organizer of the march, Manik Malhotra, said if rapes were not stopped, the day was not far off when humanity would come to an end.
 
 It is worth mentioning that Ludhiana has witnessed protests against the brutal rape-and-murder, most notably by the students of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) who held a candle march on April 13. Many residents have also taken to social networking sites to express their outrage and horror at the incidents.
