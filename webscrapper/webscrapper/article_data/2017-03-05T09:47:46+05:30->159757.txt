DUBAI:   blew out 37 candles on his birthday cake on Saturday but a fourth title at the   wasn't among the gifts he had picked for himself. 

 The Indian and his Polish partner   went down to fourth seeds Dutchman Jean-Julien Rojer and Romania's Horia Tecau in the final, coming up short in the super-tie-break.
 
 Tecau and Rojer, who didn't drop a set en route to the title round, came through 4-6, 6-3, 10-3 to take the winner's cheque of $157, 570 while Bopanna and Matkowski took home $ 77,140.
 
 Bopanna, who won titles in 2012 (with  ), 2014 (AisamUl-Haq Qureshi), 2015 ( ), ripped a forehand crosscourt to break Tecau in the fifth game after an intense exchange. Then in the eighth game, the Indo-Polish combine did well to comeback from 0-40 to take a 5-3 lead, Matkowski closing out the game with a 196 kmph down-the-middle serve on the deciding point. Bopanna then served out the set to give his team early advantage. 
 
 In the second set, the fourth seeds did well to hold off their opponents, who were pushing in the opening game on Rojer's serve. Bopanna and Matkowski, 36, didn't quite get into the decider. The fourth seeds, a seasoned combine, who clinched the 2015 Wimbledon crown the season-ending ATP prize that year, sprinted to an early lead and stayed ahead. The Indo-Polish pairing managed just three points in the super-tiebreak in the 80-minute contest.
