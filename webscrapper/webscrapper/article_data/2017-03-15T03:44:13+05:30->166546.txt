NEW DELHI: Health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday inaugurated a polyclinic, a primary health centre where specialists are available for consultation, and 49   clinics. 

 Jain said the government plans to start 150 polyclinics and 1,000 mohalla clinics by the year-end. “We are also adding more beds to existing hospitals. For example, Bhagvan Mahavir hospital, which has 200 beds at present, is going to have 600 more beds,” Jain said at Rani Bagh. 
 
 The construction of mohalla clinics and polyclinics is part of the   government’s project to create a three-tier health system in Delhi, said officials. While the mohalla clinics are meant for primary care, the polyclinics are supposed to provide consultation for serious health issues. 
 
 Experts say the concept is good but ensuring quality service in them would be key to the project’s success.
 
 “Most mohalla clinics are running out of rented premises. They don’t have proper storage facility and the doctors are being paid on per patient basis. Only opening clinics or building clinics won’t help; it is important to identify dedicated manpower to run them well,” said an expert.
 
 While the first   had lab services attached to it, the newer clinics have empanelled personnel from private labs to take blood samples. “We held a bid where all NABL accredited labs were asked to quote prices for tests. Those offering maximum discounts were included,” an official said.
 
 The government, he added, has empanelled private doctors to work as consultants. “They are paid Rs 30 per patient,” the official said.
