Rajkot: Being addicted to chewing tobacco proved costly for a primary school teacher of Sara village in Muli taluka of Surendranagar. Not only was he reprimanded by the district primary education officer (DPEO) but he also lost one-year increment for his addiction. This is probably the first of its kind punishment for a serving school teacher in the state where he was penalized for chewing tobacco.

 Paresh Chauhan, primary school teacher of Sara village at Muli had come to the DPEO’s office in Surendranagar to submit hard copy of an application form for transfer which he had already filled online. Since he had reached a little early, Chauhan was sitting in waiting room with tobacco in his mouth.
 
 When Surendranagar DEPO R C Patel arrived, at around 10am, he saw Chauhan spitting tobacco juice outside the waiting room. Patel called Chauhan and inquired about him and his purpose of visit. Patel then asked Chauhan about the substance in his mouth, to which the latter said it was tobacco. 
 
 “I told him that a teacher chewing tobacco does not set a good example for students. But he did not show any remorse for the habit,” Patel told TOI. Meanwhile, an elderly sweeper of the office also complained that Chauhan had been spitting all over the floor that she had just cleaned.
 
 Patel then asked Chauhan if he would stop chewing tobacco, to which the latter replied in the negative. “This is when I decided that penalty should be imposed on the teacher to set an example for others. So, I immediately ordered to stop his increment for a year,” said Patel. “We have been warning teachers about such issue in the past. But this is the first time we have taken penal action against one,” he added.
