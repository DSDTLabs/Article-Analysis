MUMBAI: Properties of public servants disproportionate to their known sources of income will now not only be attached, but also confiscated. Currently, the attached assets continue to be in the custody of the public servant and she/he can enjoy the property and its benefits up to the end of court proceedings. 

 On Tuesday, the state government introduced the   Confiscation of Disproportionate Property (of Public Servants) Act, 2018 in the state assembly. 
 
 The Bill allows the state government to make an application before the designated court for confiscation of the money and property of a public servant who has committed criminal misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
 
 The action is to be taken on the basis of a report from the director general, Anti-Corruption Bureau, Maharashtra state, duly approved by the committee under the chairmanship of additional chief secretary, home department along with director general,   and secretary of the department concerned. 
 
 The committee must have reasonable ground to believe that a public servant who has held, or is holding public office or has been a public servant committed the offence and has assets in excess of 50% of his known sources of income or Rs 10 lakh, whichever is more.
 
 If the public servant is ready to deposit the market value of the property to be confiscated with the court then such money or property shall not be attached. 
 
  The confiscation can be done before the final order. There will be a time limit to ensure speedy disposal of case and refund of money or property if the person is acquitted. 
 
 The application for confiscation is to be made by a police officer of the rank of deputy superintendent of police before the designated court.
