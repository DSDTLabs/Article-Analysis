FAIZABAD/AYODHYA: Amid incidents such as lynching of a man by ‘gau rakshaks’ in Alwar and the return of a gifted cow by SP leader Azam Khan to  , cows in the twin towns of Ayodhya-Faizabad are dying due to hunger and diseases.

 Deaths of about half a dozen cows have been reported in the past two days. The bodies were spotted by locals in various   dumps.
 
 Administrative officers tried to remove the bodies but the scenes were captured by locals on camera.
 
 Ananat Kumar, a resident, said, “Several cows have been dying of hunger and disease. When a cow dies, administrative officials promptly remove the bodies and throw them in the Saryu.”
 
 “No officer or political party representative has come forward to rescue or cure dying cows,” said Rohit Singh, a student.
 
 BJP MLA from   Ved Prakash Gupta said, “These cows are dying after eating poisonous garbage. I have taken note and will do the needful.”
