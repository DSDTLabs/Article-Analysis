MUMBAI: In the ongoing  , five kites and two parrots were rescued by the Plant and Animals Welfare Society (PAWS-Mumbai), a  , from various parts of the city over the last two days. 

 "We received rescue calls for the dehydrated and injured kites and parrots from Bhandup, Vikhroli, Andheri and Goregaon areas. Some crows were seen circling over the birds and aggressively pecking at the vulnerable creatures which were unable to fly as they had become weak due to the heat," said activist   of PAWS-Mumbai.
 
 Multi-vitamin drops were administered to the rescued birds after which they were kept under observation. "We have informed the forest department about the wildlife rescues as these are species protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972," he said.
 
 The calls were received from local residents. PAWS-Mumbai volunteers also cautioned citizens not to keep parrots as pets, as it is an illegal act, considering that parakeets are a protected species in India.
 
 Due to scarcity of clean sources of water, summer season is a very difficult time for animals, birds and reptiles. 
 
 "So if you see any animal in distress, birds affected due to heat stroke, please call animal welfare organizations. Also, if you see reptiles (snakes) in your vicinity, don't kill, them, call a snake rescuer," said Subramanian.
