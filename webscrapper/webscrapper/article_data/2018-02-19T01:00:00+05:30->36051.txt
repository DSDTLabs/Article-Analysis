 Yashpal, who has been to Lucknow several times before, has many fond memories of the city. Talking about what all he likes about the city, he shared, "The city has its own history with so many old monuments which reflect the Nawabi culture. Lucknow has its own beauty and depth. And jab bhi yahan ki bheed bhari galiyon aur bazaaron se meri car nikalti hai toh mazaa aa jaata hai. There is one part of the city which is highly urbanized, giving a feeling that you are in a foreign country while the other has retained its old world charm. So, the stark contrast and the balance of the old world charm and urbanization attracts me to the city more than anything else."
 After doing a variety of roles in films and theatre, and establishing himself as an actor in Bollywood, Yashpal, who is an ardent fan of   said, "I want to do a different kind of roles without repetition and that is why I have stopped doing roles like Gangaajal. You get stereotyped and then you have to break the mould to move on in your career."
 Yashpal is one of the few actors who doesn’t mince words when you ask him about nepotism in Bollywood. "Yes, it does exist. Who denies that? Abhishek Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan get films without any efforts, they don’t struggle. But on the other side of the coin, I would say their struggle is much more than us because they have to prove themselves."
 Apart from acting,   has plans for direction too. "I am going to direct a biopic based on the life of Haryanvi poet Lakhmi Chand on which I have been working for the past two years. The period film is slated to go on floor in August-September this year," informed Yashpal.
