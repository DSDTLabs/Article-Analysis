Dharwad: In order to combat the menace of   and address the problem of variance in the quality of certificates, the   has directed all the universities to purchase marks cards and degree   from   ( ). The order was issued in August 2016. 

  (KU),  , which will hold its annual convocation next month, will purchase all the required certificates from MSIL.   vice-chancellor   told TOI that the certificates to be supplied by MSIL have more security features. “For marks cards, we use 65 grams per metre (GSM) paper, while 135 GSM paper will be used to make degree certificates. The cost is a little more, but the quality is worth the price,” Gai added.
 
 “MSIL will use ‘Lekhak’ brand of paper which is water- and tear-resistant. Moreover, the security features of these documents can’t be tampered so easily,” said a senior official at the higher education department.
 
 In December last year, KU lodged a complaint with the Dharwad suburban police, seeking a probe into the fake marks card racket. A few students from Odisha, who were duped by an agency, and awarded BEd certificates purported to have been issued by KU, grew suspicious over their authenticity and sent them for verification to Dharwad. “We received a marks card from Gunanidhi Sahu of Odisha, which was followed by another one from Priyanka Dwiwedi, also from the same state. In all, we received about 58 such certificates for verification. All of them were found to be fake. The issue was placed before the university syndicate, and it was decided to probe the matter further,” Gai said.
 
 Among the discrepancies found in the fake marks cards was the signature of the controller of examinations in the place of the registrar (evaluation).
 
 “Students voluntarily sent us the marks cards after they grew suspicious over their legitimacy,” Gai said.
