AHMEDABAD: Around 13 years ago, life meant nothing more to her than offering blessings to pregnant women, married couples, and kids. At other times she prayed to her kuldevi for blessings.  , a eunuch, had no idea that motherhood was about to change her life. When  , as she is now known, learnt that her brother had lost his wife and was not in a position to raise their infant son, she instantly decided to adopt the one-month-old. She named him Gopal.

 “Fortunately, my brother agreed without much hesitation,” said Manisha. “Life changed in a day and raising and nurturing Gopal became my sole aim in life.”   said she wants to fulfil Gopal’s dream of becoming a teacher. “He remained very ill during his early childhood as he did not get mother’s milk,” she said. “I couldn’t breastfeed and therefore he developed deficiencies. That was a tough time for me as I wasn’t sure whether I’d be able to take care of him.” However, doctors helped Gopal recover.
 
 After Gopal grew up, Manisha adopted her niece, Nandini. “My sister’s family already had three daughters and limited earnings,” said Manisha. “I wouldn’t have been able to see a girl child abandoned and thus volunteered to adopt her around four years ago. My life is complete now.”
 
 Manisha stays in a house near   near Naroda, along with other eunuchs, who adore the kids and help her nurture them. After her work is done, she is often found sitting with Gopal and Nandini trying to read and learn from Gopal’s books.
 
 Despite limited earnings, Manisha is determined to get both her kids educated. “I could not complete my education due to various reasons and barely studied till class 4,” she said. “However, I want my children to become independent and make a difference to society.”
