 Following suit is his friend and schoolmate, Prayas Arora. An athlete, Prayas can’t imagine a future without football. He scored 78.5% in board exams and has now applied to   in Delhi. He wants to be a professional   player and will dedicate himself to it fully. Expressing his passion for the sport, he said, “Football is something I know I’m good at and it’s my dream to play for the Indian football team.”
 
 Study Hall passout Vikhyat Tandon is all set to be a young entrepreneur. Moved by his passion for graphic designing and his dream of setting up an all-inclusive event management venture, Vikhyat has decided to take a year off to establish his startup. He has always been involved in event management. After representing at many MUNs (Model United Nations) he made a lot of contacts with like-minded people and decided to give his dreams a chance. His venture will be called “MyLoreStudio”.
 
 Vikhyat told TOI, “I love graphic designing and have completed a course in the city. But mostly I have learned from tutorial videos online. I want to pursue communication designing from Parsons Institute in New York.”
