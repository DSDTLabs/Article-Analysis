VADODARA: The newly constructed town hall at   will be available to local artists at 50 % of the actual rent for the next one year. 

 Vadodara   (VMC) on Sunday announced this following a suggestion by chief minister (CM) Vijay Rupani who was in the city to inaugurate a series of projects including the first town hall in the eastern parts of the city. 
 
 Addressing a gathering, Rupani said that many small organisations cannot afford to book town halls if the rents charged are exorbitant. He suggested that rents should be such that the town hall remains buzzing with cultural activities throughout the year and remains affordable to all. 
 
 “You can keep different AC and non-AC rates. But it should remain affordable,” he said. While Rupani was continuing his address, mayor Bharat Dangar handed over a paper to the CM stating that the town hall will be provided to local artists at 50 % rent for the next one year. Rupani himself made the announcement. 
 
 The town hall, which has been named after BJP ideologue  , is third in the city after Gandhi Nagargruh and Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh.
 
 Rupani also stressed that the state government is working towards overall development of cities. “We are working on how we can reduce the effects of climate change and pollution in our cities to avoid health hazards. Also, our cities need to get more amenities and facilities,” he said. 
 
 Artist   welcomed the announcement made by the CM. “At other places, we need to make arrangements for the sound system. But since this new town hall is equipped with digital sound system, local artists will also save upon the expense incurred in arranging the sound system,” he said.
