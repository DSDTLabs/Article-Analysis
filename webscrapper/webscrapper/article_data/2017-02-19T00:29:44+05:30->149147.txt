NAVI MUMBAI: The   had to withdraw a proposal for leasing   of around 600 CCTVs after questions were raised by corporator M K Madvi during standing committee meeting on Thursday.

 The proposal for maintaining the lease line was estimated to cost over Rs 7 crore. “The proposal seemed to inappropriate and when the administration was questioned, they admitted a typo error, as the maintenance amount is for five years,” said standing committee chairman Shivram Patil.
 
 When Madvi probed if there was any warranty period as the CCTVs were installed recently, the administration decided to table a revised proposal.
 
 “It was a logical question, considering companies usually give warranty. Hence we questioned the need for the maintenance. Administration seems to have understood and voluntarily withdrew the proposal,” said Patil.
