LUCKNOW: Former   of UP and Uttarakhand   on Sunday said Samajwadi Party national president   Yadav is more pro-Muslim than his father and party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. He said as UP chief minister, Akhilesh initiated some concrete steps for the welfare of the community.

 The former governor’s statement gains significance under the light of SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav’s comments that Akhilesh had a negative approach towards Muslims. Akhilesh’s political rivals including the BJP and the BSP have used Mulayam’s statement to claim that as UP CM, he had failed to live up to the expectations of the minority community. Qureshi said Akhilesh has done nothing that can remotely suggest he was not pro-Muslim. About calls by several Muslims clerics including Shahi Imam of Delhi Jama Masjid Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari asking the community to vote for BSP, the former governor said Imam Bukhari has no say in the community. “Jo insaan apne ghar ke vote na dilwa paye..woh sab Muslamano ke kya vote dilwayega (He has no say in his family, how can he influence the community to vote for a party)?” 
 
 Contradicting Mulayam’s claim that Akhilesh was averse to appointing a Muslim as police chief of the state, Qureshi said he had rooted for assigning the state police chief’s job to a member of the minority community. “Akhilesh had informed me that despite the fact that he (present UP DGP) was 13the on the seniority list, he would recommend his name for the post,” he said.
 
 Batting for the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance in the state elections, Qureshi said though Akhilesh government had forwarded the Bill for Jauhar University in Rampur to  , it was left unattended for quite sometime. “When I was Governor, I cleared the Bill. Even Congress president Sonia Gandhi rooted for it,” he said, addressing mediapersons at SP headquarters in Lucknow on Sunday.
