NEW DELHI: Moments after US president   accused   of harboring   and lying about it,   foreign minister   responded that the world will find out the difference between facts and fiction.

 "We will respond to President Trump's tweet shortly inshallah ... Will let the world know the truth...difference between facts & fiction," Asif tweeted in response. 
 
  
  
 
 In an angry, early morning tweet, Trump accused Pakistan of "lies and deceit" in return for the $33 billion aid the US gave it in the last 15 years.
 
 "The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools," Trump had tweeted.
 
  
  
 
 Last week, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was seriously weighing whether to withhold $255 million in already delayed aid to Islamabad over its failure to better crack down on terror groups in Pakistan.
 
 In September last year, Asif had scoffed at Trump's comment that the US has given Pakistan "billions and billions of dollars" in financial aid even as he acknowledged that Pakistan has to continue its efforts in dismantling terrorism.
 
 
 
 
 "No billions of dollars were dished out to us, that was money for services rendered. No billions of dollars," he had said.
  
 Asif also made an impassioned defence of his country, lamented its slide into extremism and laid much of the blame on the rise of terrorist elements in Pakistan in the last 20 years on the US.
