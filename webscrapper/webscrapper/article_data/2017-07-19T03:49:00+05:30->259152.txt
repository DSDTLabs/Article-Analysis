Porvorim: Deputy speaker Michael Lobo urged the state government to resolve the medium of instruction (MoI) issue within the next two to three months and give parents the choice to decide about the MoI for their children. Taking part during the discussion on motion of thanks to the governor’s address, Lobo said that one unresolved issue in the education sector is the MoI issue. “It is stuck somewhere,” Lobo said, adding that there are a lot of pending demands of Church-run schools and the government should clear their demands. He also said that chief minister Manohar Parrikar should sit with these schools to resolve their demands. “We should not bring politics into education. Let us not play with the education of the children and let us give them what they want,” he said. “Let parents decide which school they want to send their children to, and in which medium they want to study in,” he added.  Lobo requested the chief minister to take the help of coalition partners Goa Forward Party, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, independents and even the opposition to solve the MoI issue. Reacting to the remark by Sadhvi Saraswati over the beef issue, Lobo asked what was the reason for her to make the statement in Goa. “I think police should initiate action against her. Otherwise, somebody else will come here to disturb peaceful Goa,” he added. Lobo said that anyone who gives hate speeches in Goa should be booked and summoned to the police headquarters. “My demand is that such kinds of people should be banned from entering Goa, those who try to disturb the peaceful and communal harmony of Goa,” he added.
