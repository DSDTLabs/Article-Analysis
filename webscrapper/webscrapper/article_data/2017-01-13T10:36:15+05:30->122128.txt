ALLAHABAD: With the city failing to make it to the second list of smart cities, now the intelligentsia would be roped in to iron out the chinks and ensure a place in the third list.

 The   has sought suggestions from academicians, retired judges and scholars to rework the earlier proposals. This would be in addition to the core committee the   would be constituting to discuss and chalk out a smart plan for the city. 
 
 When the scheme was announced, Allahabad was touted as among the top three of the 98 smart cities to be developed. However, it failed to make the cut even in the second list announced by the ministry of urban development.
 
 Municipal corporator   said, “AMC’s first two proposals were rejected by ministry, raising serious doubts about the capability of the AMC and other stakeholders. This time, the AMC wants to present a plan that speaks for itself so intelligentsia has been incorporated as another stakeholder.” 
 
 Lack of self-sustainability was a shortcoming in the first two proposals, said sources, so the agency that prepared the earlier plan has been removed since. Now, academicians would be asked to work on ways to generate employment as well as make projects productive so that they generate revenue and need no additional funds. Department heads of the AMC and ADA would comprise the core committe for the   project.
