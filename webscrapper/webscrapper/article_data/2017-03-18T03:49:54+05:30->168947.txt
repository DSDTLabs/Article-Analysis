GURUGRAM: A women’s rights organisation and other groups have filed a petition in the National Commission for Women, National Human Rights Commission and the  , seeking a probe into the “suspicious” death of a domestic help in an upscale condominium in DLF Phase 5 last week. They have also claimed that she was a minor at the time of her death.

 The woman, Ranjeeta Brahma, who was originally from Assam, died on the night of March 10 after allegedly jumping from the balcony of the 11th-floor flat of her employer, a senior banking executive, in Carlton Estate. Police have already formed a special investigation team to probe her death.
 
 Maya John of the Centre for Struggling Women said her organisation, along with Gharelu Kamgaar Union, North East Forum for International Solidarity (NEFIS) and few student organisations from the Boro community, has filed the petition. She claimed Ranjeeta was a minor at the time of her death and was kept in confinement by her employer. “She would have turned 18 in a few days had she survived,” she said.
 
 On Friday evening, she also met with the vice-chairperson of Haryana  , Suman Dhaiya, and discussed the case with her.
 
 Domestic workers and Ranjeeta's friends have also accused the police of inaction, saying there is enough prima facie evidence to arrest her employer and his wife. “We suspect there was foul play and abuse at the hands of the employer,” said John.
