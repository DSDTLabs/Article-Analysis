CHENNAI: The corporation plans to modify its parks and playgrounds to provide sensory stimulation to children with disabilities.

 As a pilot project,   has selected a playground near the   for Inclusive Education on Sathome High Road.The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan-run centre provides free speech renedy and physiotherapy to children up to the age of 14.
 
 The corporation will add sensory play equipment to the playground. “We want to convert one existing park to a sensory park on a pilot ba sis and then emulate it in other parks,“ a corporation official said. “The govern ment is floating funds for this too.“
 
 Sensory equipment essentially has sand, textured surfacing and sensory planting, with tactile signs for those with visual impairment and pictorial signs for people with learning difficulties. Children with autism and cerebral palsy are said to benefit from sensory stimulation. The early intervention programme at the centre includes play and sensory stimulation.
 
 “Great studies on disability can come out of inclusive play spaces,“ said S Shankar, voluntary consultant at the centre and member of  , which is coordinating with the corporation.
 
 “For instance, a hearing impaired child will require visual perceptions such as colours and a visually challenged child will need stimulants such as tactile path.Among children with autism we can observe stimulations that trigger them and calms them and understand behavioural challenges based on that.“
 
 Playgrounds, toys and play equipment, which are readily available to children, have almost always been inaccessible to children with disabilities.
