KOCHI: The project to resume train services to Cochin Harbour Terminus (CHT) railway station still hangs fire for want of approval. Though the work on the railway line and station has already been completed, railway officials are waiting for approval from the headquarters of Southern Railway to restart services.

 
 Officials with   said that they have already conducted trial run through the newly-constructed railway line. “We conducted trial runs successfully. All we require now is an approval from our headquarters,” an official said.
 
 
 The plan is to start services from the terminus to Thrissur, Kottayam and Alappuzha. Services to the station had been stopped a decade ago after the Navy objected to the move to electrify the 5km track from Thevara to Harbour Terminus.
 
 
 “Now, the plan is to use diesel engines from   to the terminus. Availability of diesel engines is a prerequisite for starting the service,” the official said. There were also plans to extend some of the services which halt at Ernakulam Junction and   (North) stations to harbour station.
 
 
 The proposal to renovate   located behind the high court and resume services to the station also remains a dream. There are 40 acres in the area which can be used for setting up an eco-friendly railway station. Resuming services to Old Railway Station would help decongest South and North railway stations.
