UDAIPUR: A police case against a private school teacher has been registered in   for forcing a   to strip as she could not complete her homework. 

 The incident took place in a private school situated in Fauj Mohalla in the temple town on Saturday. A teacher named Kiran allegedly forced one of the students to take off her 'salwar' because the girl had not completed her homework. The victim's brother who studies in the same school came to know of the incident and reported it to his father. When the guardians went to the school to enquire, the school authorities allegedly misbehaved with them and defended the teacher claiming that there had been no such incident.
 
  On the girl's father's complaint, police registered a case under Section 354 of the IPC. The family has even provided video footage to the police. The investigation continued on Sunday. 
 
 "We visited the spot and recorded statements of some people. Prima facie, the student was forced to strip. On Monday, the victim's statement would be recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC and the accused will be arrested," Gopal Nath, the investigating officer told TOI. 
 
 Meanwhile, the education department is also initiating action against the erring school for serving corporal punishment to students which is prohibited by law. "A committee will be constituted to hold inquiry and if the complaint is found to be true, proper action would be taken," said Yugal Bihari Dadeech, district education officer. 
 
 The school is an old institution of repute. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru. There are 400 students in the school which imparts free education to them. Complete expenses are borne by the Jain community. Meanwhile, the school management claimed that the accused teacher was on leave for past five days and had joined back only on Saturday.
