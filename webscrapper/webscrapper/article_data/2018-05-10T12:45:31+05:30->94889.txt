VADODARA: A woman cop suffered grievous injuries on her head after she was attacked by an unidentified person in the old city on Tuesday night. Wadi police sub-inspector A   was rushed to SSG Hospital for treatment and her condition is reported to be stable. Police have filed a case of attempt to murder and picked up four persons in connection with the attack. But no one has been arrested yet.

 
 According to the police, Tomar and her team of cops had gone to   at about 1.30am to close down some shops and roadside stalls that were open well beyond the deadline. But the stall owners raised objection and it led to heated arguments between the police and them. A group of locals gathered around the police team during the melee. Suddenly a man identified as   snatched Tomar’s baton and hit her on head.
 
 Tomar started bleeding profusely and it led to commotion in the area. Senior cops rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. When contacted, Raopura police inspector B G   said they are trying to ascertain identity of all the people who were present at the spot. “Most of the people who were present during the ruckus are roadside stall owners,” Chetariya said. Rafiq has also been booked for attempting to snatch Tomar’s revolver.
 
 While the cops ensure that strict deadline is maintained by the roadside stall owners in western parts of the city, many such stalls remain open well past midnight in old city areas. When the police recently interacted with citizens on Twitter, some people also raised the issue of food stalls functioning beyond the deadline in some old city areas.
 
 City police commissioner Manoj Sashidhar said that the cops are making efforts to ensure strict deadlines in the city. "The police was trying to close down shops that remain open beyond the deadline. During one such drive this incident occurred. But our drive will continue."
