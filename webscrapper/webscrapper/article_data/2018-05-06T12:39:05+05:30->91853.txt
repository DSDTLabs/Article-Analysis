NAGPUR: The cash seizure-turned-dacoity case, in which three   personnel including API Sunil Sonwane were booked, will now mainly revolve around the collection of evidence. The police would also look forward to collaborate with other investigating agencies like Income Tax (IT) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) to find out the possible flow of the cash and itâ€™s usages to prepare a strong case.

 Senior PI of   has taken over the inquiry into the case registered at   police station on Friday as per the decision of the top brass. He has already started gathering evidences.
 
 Apart from the dacoity case, the cops are also trying to unearth the hawala channel involved in the case and the persons linked with it. Though a Raipur-based jeweller has claimed the cash to be belonging to him, the process of transferring the amount seem to have now become another focus point of the investigation especially with the information coming to fore that the drivers, rounded up with the cash, used to travel to-and-fro Nagpur and   and also to other cities several times in a week.
