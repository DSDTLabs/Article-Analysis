Chandigarh: The new year has finally brought good news to 812 teachers and 245 other employees working under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in UT Chandigarh as ministry of human resource and development is finally going to transfer second installment of the drive’s budget this week. This implies that the SSA teachers will get their dues and also, timely salaries in 2018. The installment that amounts to around 40 crores is expected to be transferred to UT in one or two days.

 As per commitment of Government of India to Chandigarh in the minutes of Project Approval Board meeting, the second installment was to be released in November 2017. However, it will be coming now. The delay in the transfer of budget had become a major problem in the last three years, due to which the teachers’ salaries were being consistently delayed.
 
 As on now 15 % salary of October, and full salary of November and December month of 812 Teachers and 245 other employees is still pending.
 
 President of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers Welfare Association, Chandigarh Arvind Rana said, “The last three years have been disasters for teachers and also for the students who failed to get their text books and uniforms on time. This occurred due to the delay in transfer of complete budget by Government of India. We have fought hard with both Chandigarh administration and MHRD and even sent a legal notice to them last year. Hopefully, after this, the budget problem of teachers and students will be solved.”
