NAGPUR: In a first for the   (NMC), its officials will have to mandatorily reserve time for people visiting them for official work. If the rule is implemented effectively, officials of all departments at the   head office and zone offices will be available for the common man and activists between 3pm and 5pm on every Monday and Friday.

 Following directives from municipal commissioner  , additional municipal commissioner   has implemented Zero Pendency and Daily Disposal drive in the civic body a few days ago. As part of the drive, officials will have to promptly display timings for people’s visit to their offices. “Officials should avoid outside tours, visits and meetings during the given time. The public should be heard properly by giving sufficient time,”   said.
 
 Kumbhare also said this is not a temporary measure but a rule to be followed always. In the circular itself, Kumbhare has stated that officials have been found to not devoting time to meet citizens, hear grievances and solve them.
 
 As per the circular, the NMC has introduced Zero Pendency and Daily Disposal drive on the lines of policy implemented by the state government. Directives have been given to ensure disposal of files as soon as possible to ensure timely justice to citizens, speedy execution of works and improvement in civic services.
 
  activist   lauded the move but said it should be implemented in an effective manner. “I have had very bad experiences while trying to meet officials of PWD and NMC projects departments. The officials even neglect RTI activists. Officials are not present during the evening hours when citizens and activists visit their offices. Majority of the problems can be solved if officials meet people. This will improve civic services drastically and also NMC’s image,” he said.
 
 Property taxpayers and water consumers have to make several rounds to meet officials to get their problems solved, especially at zone offices.
