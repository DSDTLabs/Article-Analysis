SURAT:  ,  ,  , accused broker Lalaji Kayda returned the pouch of diamond parcel taken from trader   by filling it with sugar granules!

 Varachha police station officials booked Kyada, a resident of Yogi Chowk in Punagam, for cheating. Despite several reminders, Kayda did not make the payment to Dhaduk.
 
 Kyada was engaged in diamond broking in Mini Bazaar diamond market of Varachha since many years. He was also doing business with Dhaduk and had purchased diamonds from him in the past too. Dhaduk said in his complaint that as Kayda was regular with the payments, he gave him diamonds worth Rs 7.19 lakh.
 
 On August 28, 2016, Kyada called up Dhaduk and asked him to send the pouch of 29.67 carat polished diamonds. He assured of making the payment immediately in cash after receiving the pouch. Due to their business terms, Dhaduk trusted Kyada and sent the diamond pouch with one Hitesh Thummar.
 
 Kyada met Thummar at ground floor of Krink Tower in Mini Bazaar and took the pouch from him for weighing. However, he returned the pouch to Thummar, who handed it over to Dhaduk. However, they were shocked to find the diamonds were missing and instead there was sugar inside.
 
 “Police have registered statements of the complainant and Thummar. Kyada was not found at his house and he is on the run to avoid arrest. Dhaduk was earlier assured by some persons known to Kyada that the payment for diamonds would be made. Hence, he did not lodge a complaint earlier,” a Varachha police station official said.
