GUWAHATI: Manipuri filmmaker  's 'Autodriver', a 30-minute documentary on a woman auto-rickshaw driver of Imphal, has won the 'best short documentary award' at California-based  's Voices Now Film Festival, an organization that advocates women's rights through films. 

 Longjam's documentary, which was screened online on March 8 on the occasion of   Women's Day, was entering the contest which was open for online voting. 
 
 "Am completely head over heels winning this audience choice award for women's voices now film festival. I'm amazed thinking I had mapped a story from one of the remotest corners of the world and it's absolutely empowering...a story that has been able to connect with all," Longjam told TOI. 
 
 The film tells the story of Laibi, a lady auto driver based in conflict-torn Imphal city. In order to support an ailing husband and the education of her two sons, she takes up this profession, defying a traditional society. Having started off as a daily wage labourer in a brick kiln where she earns a mere Rs 60 for loading 1000 bricks, she later has to face the discrimination of passengers who shun lady auto drivers.
