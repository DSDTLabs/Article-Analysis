Madurai: Stating that the Tirunelveli collector issued a   for   near   ( ) forest that comes under the eco-sensitive zone in the district, a public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. 

 On this plea, the division bench headed by chief justice   ordered notice to the stateâ€™s environment and forest secretary, industries secretary, principal chief conservator of forest and the collector and adjourned the case. 
 
 One S Sudalaikannu has filed the petition. According to him, the collector issued tender notifications on three occasions from February 24 last inviting applications from self-help group and released bonded labourers for grant of lease for stone quarry operation in government poromboke land. However, the provision relating to minimum time for submission of tenders under the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Rules, 2000, was not followed in the tender notifications. The self-help group and bonded labourers were not given sufficient time to submit their applications. 
 
 Besides, the notification on March 7 earmarked 17 places for quarry operations, of which five places come under the eco-sensitive zone. Those places are situated within 10km from the KMTR Forest. The ministry of environment and forest has issued various guidelines for the protection of eco-sensitive zones. 
 
 Hence, representations were sent to the officials concerned on March 18 requesting not to allow quarry operation in the eco-sensitive zone. But, there was no action on their part.
