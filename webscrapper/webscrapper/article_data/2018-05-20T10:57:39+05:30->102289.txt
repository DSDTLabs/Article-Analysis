CHANDIGARH:   cannot confer the status of martyr even on India's national heroes,  , Rajguru and  . Replying to a demand for publishing an official list of martyrs, Punjab government claimed that no official recognition can be given to anybody as a "martyr" as Article 18 of the Constitution does not permit conferring of any title by the state. The demand was made by a lawyer who had asked if the trio had been recognized as martyrs. 

 The Punjab government has supported its stand by citing a judgment of Delhi HC in the case titled, Birender Sangwan Vs. Union of India and others, decided on December 12, 2017. In the said order, the HC had observed that the request of the petitioner to grant the status of martyr "shaheed" to legendry national heroes - Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev - did not have any statutory basis. The petition was therefore, dismissed. 
 
 The letter from the superintendent, general administration department (freedom fighters branch) of the state has also mentioned that the state government gives due respect to all martyrs, and tributes are paid to martyrs at state-level functions. 
 
 Many memorials to martyrs have also been raised and there is provision to declare holiday as a tribute to them.
 
 The Punjab government has also referred to a book "Dictionary of Martyrs - India's Freedom Struggle (1857-1947)" published by "Indian Council of Historical Research, New Delhi, and suggested that reference be made to the book.
