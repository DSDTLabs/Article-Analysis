MUMBAI: Noise-related complaints from residents who live alongside roads where work for   line 3 is on, prompted activist   Abdulali to visit the places on Saturday. Her readings show that at most of these places,   levels were “excessively above” prescribed limits.   has raised concerns that this could impact the health of local residents.

 Construction of   3 envisages a 33.5km fully underground line between Colaba, Bandra and Seepz in Andheri.
 
 Abdulali said she has been taking readings from December as and when she receives complaints from locals.
 
 At Mahim, for instance, she said drilling work was being done within six feet of residential buildings. Here, the noise level monitored was 106.1dB—way above the 55db prescribed limit for a residential area. 
 
 Then at Cuffe Parade, drilling continued beyond a noise barrier created and just about 15 feet from residential buildings. Here, too, the noise levels of 99dB, 100.4dB and 110dB were recorded. The situation was unchanged at Churchgate where drilling work was done 10 feet from residential buildings. The noise reading here was 92.5dB due to “banging noise”.
 
 Abdulali said if the government takes up projects of this scale, it should also ensure noise barriers are put up at various areas and not just on a certain stretch. “This is a serious issue. People with already poor health conditions could be affected badly due to this kind of drilling work. We all want Mumbai to upgrade, but then appropriate and modern technology should be put to use to ensure that such kind of noise levels are tackled appropriately,” said Abdulali.
 
 When contacted, Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd spokesperson refused to comment on the issue.
