LUCKNOW: A probe has been initiated into the unexpected caving in of the   road during the construction of the riverfront project.
Principal secretary, irrigation,   has appointed a team of engineers to carry out inspection of the site and fix accountability for the damage done.
 
 Chandra said, “I have asked the engineer-in-chief to inspect if the road caved in due to the carelessness of the contractor. As it is a major damage, we need to find the root cause.“
 
 He said the norm was that contractor shouldn't damage any government property while carrying on his construction.
 
 The contractor said though the government has fixed March 15 as the deadline to complete the construction on the bank and repair the road, he would be able to complete the repair work only by March 31.
 
 The department has allowed the contractor to use push box technology wherein heavy RCC boxes are pressed inside the soil and pushed forward to create the tunnel. This has to be used for laying intercepting drains to prevent direct flow of sewage and sludge into Gomti.
 
 But since the soil was loose and unfit for supporting massive construction, the barrage road developed a crack and started caving in from one side, near Samta Mulak Crossing.
 
 The contractor said he had anticipated it and had even informed the department about the possibility.
