THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: For former chief minister  , Monday's discussion with   vice-president   turned out to be a much needed face-saver. Chandy could now say that the high comand is looking into his grievances. If sources are to be believed, he has not received any assurances from the party high command but only a word that all the issues will be taken up after the assembly elections to five states. 

 Hence it has to be believed that the ceasefire in the state unit of Congress will last till April until the elections are over. Even though Chandy said he was satisfied with the discussion, the instruction he got from the party high command was to cooperate with the state leadership according to sources.
 
 "The party high command was not ready to succumb to any kind of the pressure tactics from Chandy. It was at the behest of A K Antony, V M Sudheeran and Ramesh Chennithala that Chandy was invited to New Delhi as a face saving measure for him,'' was how a senior party leader in New Delhi opined about Oommen Chandy's visit.
 
 However Chandy's camp has decided to adopt a wait and watch policy until the assembly elections in the five states are over. Hence for the time being there will be a ceasefire and Chandy will be attending the party meetings including the political affairs committee meeting.
 
 He has been demanding an organizational poll in the state, which has not been well received by the party high command. The senior leaders have objected to this since Chandy has never made this demand when he was heading the government twice and also when he was the opposition leader. Hence the party high command is well aware that the move is to oust V M Sudheeran from the post of   president. Sudheeran was handpicked for the post by Rahul Gandhi.
