CUTTACK: Rail commuters had a harrowing time on Tuesday after an express train stopped for nearly five hours at   after developing a snag. 

 Due to the glitch in S-6 coach of Puri-bound   early in the morning, the commuters were forced to cool their heels at the station. It resulted in delay of seven other trains as well, said a railway source. 
 
 The   (ECoR) public relations officer Tapan Kumar said, "The train coming from Howrah broke down at the Cuttack station at 2am. A technical team immediately rushed to the spot and fixed huge iron springs near wheels. Subsequently ECoR had to detach the affected coach and send the train to Puri." 
 
 "It took more than four hours to finish the work," he said. 
 
 "As the train was running on a particular upline, we had to divert several trains accordingly which affected the traffic," informed an ECOR official.
