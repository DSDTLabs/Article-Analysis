AHMEDABAD: The recent   —   within 500 metres of highways — has caused major revenue losses for leading hotels on the SG Highway which had permit  . Hoteliers, in fact, had to make alternate arrangements to serve   who have arrived for the African Development  .

 As for the losses, estimates by hotels which had permit shops in the past indicate that international events such as Vibrant Gujarat spur liquor sales of around Rs 3 lakh per day. “We had our premises ready and had made all arrangements to open a permit shop,” said Sanjay Kaushik, general manager, Crowne Plaza. “However, we did not get the licence after the Supreme Court decision. We were to host an event for the African delegation. The event will now be hosted by another hotel.”
 
 In fact, whenever a major event is organized in the city, permit shops at leading hotels stock up on premium liquor. These include Glenfiddich 18-year-old single malt priced at Rs 35,000 per bottle; Dom Pérignon champagne (Rs 24,000); Johnnie Walker Blue Label (Rs 23,000); and Italian and French wines costing Rs 10,000.
 
 “If our guests want liquor, our staff will escort them to a nearby hotel’s permit shop,” said Tejus Jose, general manager, Novotel. “The liquor ban certainly affects our revenue,” said Narendra Somani, chairman, TGB Hotels and Banquets. “We are hosting some AfDB delegates. To make them comfortable, our duty manager will help them obtain an online permit and we have arranged cabs to escort them to nearby liquor stores.”
