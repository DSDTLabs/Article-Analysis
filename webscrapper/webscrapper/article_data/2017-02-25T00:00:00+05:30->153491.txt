Playback singer   had tasted success as an actor by playing the role of a cop in Dhanush’s Maari.

 However, he has been very selective about the acting projects he takes up. The singer will next be seen in the lead role in a Tamil film, titled  . What’s most interesting about the film is that the suave and city-bred Vijay will be seen playing a villager! Ask him how he managed that and he says, “I owe it all to the director, Dhana. The setting of the movie is Theni and Kambam, and Dhana hails from there. So he was able to tell me exactly how I should portray the character.”
 
  And what made him take up a lead character in a film? “What attracted me was not the fact that I was playing the lead, but the story. It sounded nice and different. It was the experience I was looking at, not like I would be entering another level by playing a lead. The character demanded a lot of work and I went all out to play the role,” he says.
 
 Dhana has worked as Mani Ratnam’s assistant and this is his first directorial. Veteran director Bharathiraja and Vijay play the major characters in the movie, besides Tamil actor Akhil. Karthik Raja scores the music for the film. The team plans to release the movie in March.
