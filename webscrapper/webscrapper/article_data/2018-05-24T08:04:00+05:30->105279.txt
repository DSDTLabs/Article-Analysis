GURUGRAM: The forest department apprehended one person in the early hours of Wednesday for allegedly felling trees in   buffer zone of the Aravalis on the border of Gurugram and  .

 The action was taken on the day TOI carried a report on felling of around 200 trees in the buffer zone and a nearby area protected under sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Protection Act.
 
 But on Wednesday evening, there were fresh reports about chopping of 30 more trees, barely 300 metre away from the four-acre land where trees were cut on Monday and Tuesday.
 
 Forest department sources said the man apprehended revealed names of six more persons involved in illegal felling of trees in the area. 
 
 “We sent a team to Mangar on Tuesday to keep an eye on the area, especially at night. Our team stepped surveillance and nabbed a person red-handed. He has given us five-six names. We are verifying the claims,” said an official.
 
 RS Dhull, district forest officer, Faridabad, who is currently out of station, said, “We are investigating the case and will soon nab all the offenders. However, I will be able to share the details only after coming back to the city. Strict action will be taken against all those involved in the violation.”
 
 Sunil Hasrana, a resident of Mangar, who raised an alarm after spotting chopped logs in the area on Wednesday, said, “We are glad the forest offices have finally taken some action. Today (Wednesday), we found at least 30 chopped trees lying on the ground. The forest department should prevent any more tree felling in the area.”
 
 Rajesh, another resident, said they visited the place and recorded a few videos. 
 
 “We have spotted tyre marks in the area. It is unbelievable that the authorities can’t see what we are witnessing every day. We have been sending these videos to the department. Unfortunately, our requests have been falling on deaf ears,” he added.
