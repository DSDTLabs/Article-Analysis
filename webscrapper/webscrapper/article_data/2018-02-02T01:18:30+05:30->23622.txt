NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind   said on Thursday he was “disappointed that the Centre   its   towards Delhi”. Deputy CM and Delhi’s finance minister Manish Sisodia pointed out that “not a single rupee has been increased in Delhi’s share in central taxes since 2001-02 and that even this year it stays at Rs 325 crore.”

 The   has proposed Rs 790 crore for Delhi in 2018-19 as against Rs 758 crore in the budget estimates and revised estimates for 2017-18. “Thus, only 4.2% enhancment (in funds) for Delhi,” the state government said in a statement. Under the total allocation, the normal central assistance to Delhi during 2018-19 has been proposed at Rs 449.99 crore as against Rs 412.99 crore in 2017-18. This is an increase of Rs 37 crore. 
 
 An amount of Rs 5 crore has also been proposed as grant towards the disaster response fund, same as in the current year. An amount of Rs 10 crore has been given for paying enhanced compensation to the 1984 riot victims, down from Rs 15 crore in the 2017-18 Budget. 
 
 Kejriwal took to twitter to say that “he had expected some financial assistance to important infrastructure projects”. He said there was nothing in the Budget for traders and the middle class who have been “completely ignored”.
 
 “No other part of India gets such treatment. The BJP government at the Centre continues to treat Delhi residents as second-grade citizens,” he said. He also tweeted that though land and policing were under the Centre, no plans were announced for unauthorized colonies and for tackling crime and ensuring women’s safety.
 
 “We had requested the Government a number of times to enhance the allocation to at least Rs 5,000 crore as our share in central taxes as against Rs 325 crore being released to Delhi,” the government statement said. It pointed out that the Delhi’s own budget had increased in size from Rs 8739 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 48,000 crore in 2017-18 whereas its share in central taxes has remained static.
 
 “Also, the local bodies in Delhi are not getting any support from the Government although we are providing 10.5% of our annual tax collection to them,” said Sisodia. “I personally requested a special package for 2000 electric buses for Delhi which could have played a major role in combating air pollution. Unfortunately, the BJP Government does not care for Delhi.”
 
 Meanwhile, AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said the decision to open 1.5 lakh health centres was inspired by the AAP government’s mohalla clinics.
