Veteran actor  , who portrayed   in the 1975 TV series, has blasted filmmaker James Cameron for his negative comments regarding Patty Jenkins' 'Wonder Woman.' 

  
  
 Carter took to Facebook to praise the blockbuster movie and asked Cameron to stop dissing the film. 
 
  
  
 
 "To James Cameron -STOP dissing WW: You poor soul. Perhaps you do not understand the character. I most certainly do. Like all women--we are more than the sum of our parts. 
 
 "Your thuggish jabs at a brilliant director, Patty Jenkins, are ill advised. This movie was spot on. Gal Gadot was great. I know, Mr. Cameron--because I have embodied this character for more than 40 years. So--STOP IT," Carter, 66, wrote. 
 
 In August, Cameron criticized 'Wonder Woman's' favorable reception. He called the film's glowing reviews 'misguided,' and said that Wonder Woman was 'an objectified icon.'
 
 He continued that the film was 'a step backwards,' and that his creation,   of the 'Terminator' franchise, was a better female protagonist. 
 
 Jenkins at the time, responded to Cameron's comment via tweet. She wrote that Cameron's "inability to understand" Wonder Woman was "unsurprising," given that he is not a woman, adding that there is no "right and wrong kind of powerful woman." 
 
 Jenkins is currently working on the sequel of 'Wonder Woman' starring Gal Gadot in the titular role. The movie is scheduled to hit cinemas in 2019.
