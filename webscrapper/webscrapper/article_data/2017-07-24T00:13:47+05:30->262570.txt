NAVI MUMBAI:   have been warned by city experts to follow certain   before venturing out on their activities. 

 As the hiking tracks and stretches in the mountains get treacherous during  , experts have asked trekkers to take help from the umpteen clubs in Navi Mumbai.
 
 Experts are of the opinion that mishaps take place among amateur trekkers, who are unaware about basic nuances of adventure trails during the rains and come without mentors. 
 
 “Mishaps can be averted with professionals standing to take the lead. We need to know about the route thoroughly and the patch on which you make your climbing course. The support system is also more important in the terrain with proper selection of route and its map in place. For all this, books are available,” said Mandar Gupte, trekker from neighbouring Thane.
 
 However, there are no demarcated points along the Western Ghats to try out trekking trails. The local police are not even informed by revellers of their movement in the weekends especially when it is raining. During rescue and search operations, police call local experts to help them out in almost all cases. 
 
 “When something happens, police are not well trained to deal with such misadventures and finally seek help of adventure experts. Police don't have a dedicated helpline to be contacted in case of emergencies,” said Padmakar Gaikwad, an adventure trainer from Khopoli, who volunteered to help in the search for victims along Pune-Mumbai Highway and Expressway.
