AHMEDABAD: It would be a mini 'Vibrant Gujarat' at   (GFSU) on February 17 and 18 when ambassadors of 15 countries and charge d'affaires of 17 nations of Africa would converge to explore possibility of setting up forensic science laboratories in their countries to crack rising crime in the continent. 

 Ten more countries are expected to join during or after the event, effectively representing over 75% of 55 countries of the African continent that have knocked on Gujarat's doors looking for solutions to crack major crimes.
 
 GFSU officials pegged the two-day conference as the biggest conglomeration of nations in a university in India to deliberate on issues such as future of international crime, role of forensic science in prevention and cracking these crimes, requirement of infrastructure and manpower and student training in the context of Africa.
 
 Dr J M Vyas, director general of GFSU, said these collaborations carry forward Prime Minister  's engagement with the continent. Modi was present at VGGS earlier this year when GFSU signed an MoU with Rwanda for bilateral ties.
 
 " 's growing engagement with Africa was laid when we entered into partnership with Uganda in 2015 to train police personnel and upgrade investigative facilities. After Rwandan delegation's visit in early 2016, we were invited for developing forensic science laboratories in   (AU). Members of GFSU had made presentations at AU three months ago which garnered a lot of interest," said Vyas.
