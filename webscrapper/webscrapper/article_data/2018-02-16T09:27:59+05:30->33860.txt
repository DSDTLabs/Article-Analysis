KOTA: A case of sedition and defamation against former diplomat-turned-politician   was filed in the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) in Kota on Thursday. The court has fixed the case’s hearing on February 20.

 BJP’s Kota district OBC wing head   filed the case under IPC Sections 124 (A), 500 and 504 against Aiyar for expressing love and praise for Pakistan and insulting India at the 9th Karachi Literature Festival.
 
 Chaudhary was in the limelight for his recent letter to BJP president Amit Shah to demand replacement of chief minister   and party state president Ashok Parnami blaming the duo for BJP’s humiliating defeat in the bypolls.
 
 In the case against Aiyar, Chaudhary has claimed that at a function in Pakistan’s Karachi the suspended   leader said he loved Pakistan and the Pakistanis loved him back but in India he received same quantum of hatred. Chaudhary further claimed that Aiyar insulted India by saying that the country was not interested in resolving issues with Pakistan through dialogue.
 
 “The statements in favour of Pakistan have deeply hurt my patriotism and passionate sentiments for my country,” Chaudhary said in the petition to the court. The petitioner added that Aiyar’s statements have come at a time when Pakistan supported terrorists were carrying out attacks on Indian Army and Indian leaders were making best efforts to expose Pakistan for supporting terrorism.
