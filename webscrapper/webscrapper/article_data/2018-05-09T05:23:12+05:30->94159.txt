MUMBAI: In an eerie reminder of the Maria Susairaj case, a blame-game seems to have started between the two BBlunt Salon employees, Siddhesh Tamhankar (28) and Khushi Sahjwani (42), arrested for the murder of its finance manager   (28). 

 Vyas was murdered in a moving SUV after the duo picked her up from near her home on March 16 morning. Vyas wanted to sack Tamhankar as he had allegedly made double payments to some clients. 
 
  
  
 
 During questioning, Sahjwani claimed she had no role in the murder and that Tamhankar threatened her to support him after strangling Vyas, sources say. 
 
 “Asked why she did not come forth to police after the murder, she claimed that she was scared as Tamhankar threatened her and said she was also party to the crime,” an officer said. 
 
 At the other hand, Tamhankar’s family had earlier claimed that his only fault was that he was among the last two people to be seen with Vyas. They had said that he had reached his Andheri office within an hour of meeting Vyas at Grant Road and this wouldn't have been possible had he halted midway to eliminate her and dispose off her body. 
 
 They added that Sahjwani, however, did not go to office with him. Sahjwani told him she was dressed in a jogging suit and would need time to change, according to his parents.
 
 
 Investigators are yet to ascertain the exact intention for the crime. “Kirti was adamant on sacking Tamhankar. This led to an argument and a scuffle between Tamhankar and Vyas and he even tried to overpower her before strangling her,” said the official. Meanwhile, police have procured hundreds of text messages from the three mobiles seized from the duo. 
 
 “The cops have also found a couple of intimate text messages that Tamhankar and Sahjwani exchanged,” said the official. On Tuesday, officials carried out a search fore the body in the nullah behind Wadala IMAX theatre where Kirti’s body was dumped.
