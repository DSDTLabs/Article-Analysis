CHENNAI: Multinational healthcare company   has tied up with Chennai-based Y R Gaitonde Centre for   Research and Education to study India's viral diversity to improve accuracy of diagnositc tests. 

 While Abbott will provide study protocol and diagnostic equipment, YRGCARE will help in screening and sequencing rich patient data from infected populations in India.
 
  and viral hepatitis are among the biggest public health threats in India today as they can produce many genotypes (genetic constitution of an individual organism), which keep combining to form recombinant strains or mutations making detection trickier. Understanding the distribution of genotypes and recombinants is critical to development of diagnostic tests.
 
 India has the third largest HIV incidence in the world -- more than 2.1 million people. Many of them are co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). 
 
 People, who inject drugs, and sex workers are identified as key affected populations. Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, chairman, YRGCARE, said drug-using populations in India bear a disproportionate burden of HIV and HCV, and it is critical to understand the transmissions in this group. 
 
 "Sequencing data in these affected populations will help us understand the evolutionary nature of the viruses enabling optimal treatment interventions to maximize impact,‚Äù he said.
