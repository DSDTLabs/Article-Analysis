Ghaziabad: A group of men robbed a bag full of Rs 2 lakh along with some important property papers by stopping a   car in   on Saturday afternoon.

 The victim, identified as Himanshu Singhal (32), is the owner of SKS builders, and is a resident of   in New Delhi. Singhal was travelling to Meerut to visit a site along with his father, in his white Mercedes e-class car being driven by their driver when a man on a bike in front of them signaled them to stop. The man pointed towards the car’s bonnet and said oil was seeping out from the front. “We stopped the car and I asked my father to sit inside, while I and the driver got out,” said Singhal. “As soon as we opened the bonnet, we saw that the whole engine was covered with black oil and strong fumes were emanating from it,” Singhal added.
 
 Himanshu then contacted his brother and started walking towards the rear end of the car, when he saw a man fiddling with the boot. “When I ran towards him, he sprinted in the opposite direction but I caught hold of him and informed the police,” said Singhal.
 
 A chilly spray bottle was seized from the accused’s possession. However, when Singhal got back in his car, he realised that a leather bag containing Rs 2 lakh along with some important security documents were missing. 
 
 “I have no idea when stole the bag because when I caught hold of him, he had nothing. Maybe there was a third person involved,” he said.
 
 An FIR under Section 378 of the IPC was registered with Sihani Gate police station.
