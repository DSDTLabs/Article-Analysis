Panaji: PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said that a preliminary inquiry into bribes paid by a US firm to PWD officials revealed that there is no PWD official involved in the case and it is upto chief minister Manohar Parrikar to decide whether he wants to register the case and investigate further. A preliminary inquiry into the admission made by a Boston-based consultancy, that its officials paid a bribe of $1.18 million (approximately Rs 6.7 crore) to national highway authority of India (NHAI) officials between 2011 and 2015 to secure a highway and a water project contract in Goa, has revealed that not a single PWD officer is involved in the case. Dhavalikar said he has briefed the chief secretary about the inquiry and he would also brief Parrikar. “I have studied all the files related to CDM Smith and have sent them to the chief secretary. The chief secretary will take a decision after discussing it with Parrikar,” Dhavalikar said, adding that what he has come across is that CDM Smith has stopped work across the country, while work given to them by the sewerage corporation in 2012 has been terminated. “If the chief minister wants any further inquiry, then let him initiate it,” Dhavalikar said, adding, “I don’t feel that our officers are involved in this case”. CDM Smith has agreed to pay $ 40,371,38 (approximately Rs 25 crore) to the US Treasury, the amount it earned as profit from “illegally obtained” works for highway construction supervision and design contracts and a water project contract in Goa. The company will pay the entire amount in four instalments by October 1, 2017, an official communication from the US justice department said.
