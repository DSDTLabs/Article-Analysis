NEW DELHI: A decorated woman shooter-cum-coach showed exemplary courage and rescued her relative who was held being hostage in his taxi by two men in northeast Delhi’s Bhajanpura late on Thursday. The woman managed to pull out her relative from the clutches of the kidnappers even before the police could arrive at the spot.

 Around 1am, the woman made a call to the PCR saying that her cousin had been kidnapped and the abductors were demanding a ransom of Rs 25,000, which was to be dropped off near a park.
 
 The victim, Asif (21), had picked up the kidnappers after they had booked his cab. When they kept asking him to move around in circles in the same area, Asif got suspicious and asked them their exact destination. He stopped his vehicle and refused to move if they didn’t give him proper directions.
 
 The duo then held him by the throat and snatched his wallet. However, they found just Rs 150 in it and got angry. “They made the first ransom call around 11am and the second half an hour later,” said a senior police officer.
 
 After calling the cops, the woman reached near the park and after spotting her cousin fired in the air to scare off the kidnappers. The duo then let Asif go. Police soon reached the spot and nabbed the kidnappers. A case has been registered against them. One of the kidnappers got injured in his legs and the other in his pelvic area after getting into a scuffle with Asif inside the taxi.
