BENGALURU: The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) shifted 43 of its North Karnataka-bound operations from Kempegowda bus station (KBS) to   station in Peenya.

 KSRTC officials said 60 buses to places like Tumkur, Pavagada, Davanagere, Hassan, Chikkamangalur will be shifted to Peenya. They said this is an attempt to decongest KBS and utilize Basaveshwara bus station, which was constructed in 2014 at Rs 40 crore. KSRTC officials said they are operating free shuttle services in and around Peenya to help people reach the bus terminus.
 
 KSRTC had previously attempted to shift North Karnataka-bound operations to Peenya but that effort failed. This was largely because private buses were allowed to operate trips from the city so passengers were reluctant to board KSRTC buses from Peenya. KSRTC suffered a loss of Rs 12 crore, which forced them to shift operations back to KBS.
 
 However, KSRTC officials said this time it will work because of Metro connectivity. BMRCL is also planning travelators that will connect Peenya Industry Metro station with Basaveshwara bus terminus. At present, Kerala   is operating some schedules from Peenya.
