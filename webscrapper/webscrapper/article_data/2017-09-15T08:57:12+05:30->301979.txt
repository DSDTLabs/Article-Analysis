AMARAVATI: A day after the famed British architect   & Partners submit ted the final designs of the permanent government complex, legislative assembly and council, high court and other important buildings which will come up in Amaravati, chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu sprang a surprise by bringing in local touch in the form of `Bahubali' director  , who will now play a key role in shaping the final designs and ensuring world-class architecture in the dream capital. Naidu suggested to senior officials that Rajamouli can be consulted for his inputs and the ace director can be flown to London in the coming weeks to discuss the designs with Foster's team.

 The CM, along with senior ministers reviewed the designs at the secretariat here on Thursday and directed Capital Region Development Authority ( ) commissioner Ch Sreedhar to involve Rajamouli.
 
 Naidu told the British architect, who was present at the meeting, that he would be visiting London on October 25 to see the final designs.
 
 Rajamouli has already been sounded before by the government. The final models of the buildings for the assembly and the High Court were presented to the CM on Wednesday. The CM indicated to the architect team that first designs in the public domain were getting mixed response from the public and suggested to them to take some more time before submission of final designs but appreciated the waterfront, the layout and the interior designing of the legislative assembly. He advised the firm to spend a little more time on the fa√ßade, as he wants to ensure that the building reflects world-class architecture.
 
 Naidu said that he will be investing more time on the final designs as he intends to lock the final plans by October. He told ministers P Narayana and Yanamala Ramakrishnudu to involve youngsters, who have exposure to art and architecture in fine-tuning the designs.
