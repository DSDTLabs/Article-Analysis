CHENNAI: DMK working president and leader of the opposition in the   assembly MK Stalin on Monday criticised the AIADMK government for the “mismanagement” of the Centre for Research on Dravidian Movement (CRDM) at  . Stalin's reaction came after TOI published a story --
 
  -- on Monday. 

 The centre was initiated by the M Karunanidhi-led DMK government in 2008 and was shut down despite funds availability, a recent audit report stated. 
 
 "A centre which was created to teach our future generations about the Dravidian movement has been mismanaged by a party which has 'Dravida' in its name," Stalin said in a statement. 
 
 The DMK government had instituted chairs for research in themes of social equality, gender justice and Tamil development. "But the AIADMK has acted with an intention of enmity towards the Dravidian movement," he said. 
 
 Stalin requested chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to take steps to revive the CRDM and also directed the DMK legislators who are part of the university's senate to take urgent steps in this regard.
