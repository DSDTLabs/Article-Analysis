CHENNAI: A week after a Class II student was murdered in the washroom of the   campus near Gurgaon, some international schools in the city are seeking ways to assuage parents about their security systems.

 Some schools have brought parents into the campus to detail the measures in place, while others have held meetings with teachers about monitoring changes in a child's behaviour. At the Ryan International School's Chennai branch in Sriperumbudur, principal   met with parents on Tuesday. “Our head office asked us to reinforce security measures,“ says Christopher. “Parents are aware of our stringent security. Still, we called them in so they could see it for themselves,“ adds Christopher, who also had the credentials of security personnel reverified.The school also conducted a session with children on 'good and bad touch' and what to do in uncomfortable situations. The managements of other international schools are talking to teachers about safety of children. K R Malathi, education consultant for the  , spoke to teachers earlier this week on the importance of monitoring children's behaviour.“For instance, if they refuse to attend a particular class or take a particular school bus, one needs to check why,“ says Malathi.
 
 HLC International seems to have a completely different approach to ensuring children's safety. “Knee-jerk reactions are not the answer. More than increasing the number of ways to police the movement of people in and around school, it is better to build an environment of trust and transparency. For instance, every year, we have team building activities with the support staff and bus drivers. It acknowledges their vitality in the school's operations,“ says Naveen Mahesh, the school's director. “It takes time to build a “thick-we“ community.“
 
 Still, one does feel anxious, says Kamakshi N, mother of two primary school girls.“I know there is no need to worry, but an incident like this makes you feel uneasy when your children leave for school.“
