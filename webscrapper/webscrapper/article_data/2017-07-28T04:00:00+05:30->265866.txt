Vadodara: The detection of crime branch (DCB) has arrested a resident of Rajasthan for stealing sandalwood trees from the city. 

 Mukesh Khatik was caught from his hometown Chhittorgarh after the cops received tip-off about his involvement in the two thefts of sandalwood tree registered in the city last month. Police said Khatik along with other gang members had chopped and stolen the trees from Sayajigunj on June 10 and June 16.
 
 “We were investigating the involvement of some people who have stolen sandalwood trees in past. We learnt that Khatik was involved in the two thefts. He admitted to have committed both the thefts along with his gang,” police said.
 
 Khatik with brother Rajesh and four others had planned the thefts. 
 
 They had even hired a four-wheeler to ferry the stolen trees to Rajasthan. Khatik told the cops that he had taken help of Naseer Khan, Gotu Khan, Raju Khan and Raju Mogiya, all residents of Rajasthan to take the trees. 
 
 “Khatik was paid Rs 2,500 for stealing sandalwood on July 10 by Naseer and Raju and was yet to get paid for the second theft,” the police added.
 
 Crime branch sleuths said that Khatik had stayed in the city and drove an auto rickshaw for three years here. “He was well versed with all the areas and hence knew locations of sandalwood trees. Khatik and his gang brought equipment and cut two sandalwood trees. They took the trees’ trunks to Rajasthan to sell them off,” crime branch officials said.
 
 Khatik was arrested thrice for stealing sandalwood trees from the city in 2006 and nabbed again for stealing eight sandalwood trees in Sayajigunj in 2015. He committed a theft in Gandhinagar too. Khatik was booked and detained under PASA in 2015. The cops are now trying to ascertain whether he has committed any other crimes too.
