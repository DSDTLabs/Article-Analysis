DABOLIM:   Mongrain and   who arrived from Germany on Friday afternoon were oblivious to the strike. 

 Their India experience didn't involve pre hotel bookings or travelling in air-conditioned cabs. All they needed to get from one place to another in the state they carried with them. 
 
 No sooner they exited the airport, they got right down to opening up two large boxes. 
 
 Passers-by watched in amazement as they took out two bicycles and began assembling them just outside the gates of the arrival terminal. Goa police and   personnel as well as other travellers gathered around to see the two efficiently attaching the wheels and then changing their footwear to prepare for the journey ahead. 
 
 Matic who works as a nurse in Germany has been to India in the past. When he found that Morjim wasn't as close to the airport as he had imagined, the two decided they would head there the next day. 
 
 "We'll go for a swim instead. Do you know it's winter in Germany? So we're just longing for the sun," said Claire who plans to learn some sort of folk dance while she's in India. Matic belongs to a Jewish volunteer group that raises money for refugees. 
 
 The two will be exploring the country on their bicycles and are clearly taking it one day at a time.
