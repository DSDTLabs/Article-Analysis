As BJP national president Amit Shah concludes his tour of Mysuru region, the party’s master strategist on Saturday clearly stated that a victory in Karnataka meant that it will be a stepping stone for the saffron party’s expansionist policy down south. 

 “By gaining a victory in Karnataka and forming a strong government here, it will definitely be a door which will be opened for BJP to enter southern part of the country,” he said.
 
 Shah said the Karnataka elections, be it a win or a loss, will also have a bearing on the 2019 Parliamentary elections but exuded confidence that BJP is the only alternative for the state which has become a den of corruption under the Congress.
 
 “After the 2014 elections we have removed Congress from 11 states and I do not see any competition from the Siddaramaiah government in Karnataka, as people have made up their mind to remove the corrupt governance in the state,” he said.
 
 Shah said the Parliamentary board of the party will finalise its list of candidates shortly and that tickets will be given to those who conform to the norms of public life.
 
 “We are going to distribute tickets to only those candidates who confine in the strictest sense to the norms of public life,” said Shah, when questioned if the party will consider tickets to tainted former MLAs and former ministers with charges of corruption and other scandals.
 
 When questioned about the prospects of former mining baron, who was jailed for illegal mining, Janardhana Reddy, Shah said the party has nothing to do with Reddy.
 
 “Let me make it very clear that BJP has nothing to do with Janardhana Reddy,” he said.
 
 Shah said the party has no intent of withdrawing support to its state president and chief ministerial candidate B S  , if and when the party comes to power.
 
 “Despite the previous track record, I assured you that BJP has announced that Yeddyurappa will be our CM and will continue to remain so for five years when BJP comes to power,” he said.
