Gurgaon:   on Wednesday sealed the entrance to the Gymkhana Club’s  , claiming that the operator has not renewed its contract. An official said the development body has erected a wall at the entrance of the pool to restrict operation.

 The seven-year-old contract for the pool at   in Sector 29 had expired on March 31. However, the contractor continued to operate it in violation of norms. On April 2, estate officer Bharat Bhushan Gogia ordered the pool’s closure. According to sources, the contractor had approached the divisional commissioner, citing a court stay on mid-term cancellation of the contract. However, a probe revealed that the stay dated back to 2015.
 
 On April 10, Huda administrator and divisional commissioner had observed that the contractor could not be allowed to use the swimming pool for any usage after the contract period. It was decided that the charges would be raised. Also, Huda administrator will allow scope of future management of the swimming pool, including fresh tender and appointment of lifeguards and coaches, only after a thorough examination.
 
 Following this, the officials decided that the contractor will no longer be allowed to operate from the premises. Following this, a temporary barricade was built at the pool’s entrance on Wednesday night to prohibit entry and exit. “We have closed the entrance to swimming pool and no one is allowed to operate or use it till the new contract is assigned,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer, Huda.
