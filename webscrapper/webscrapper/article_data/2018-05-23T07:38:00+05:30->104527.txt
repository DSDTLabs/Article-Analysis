Shimla: With less than a year to go to parliamentary elections, the Congress has replaced its in-charge for Himachal Pradesh, Sushil Kumar Shinde, with another Maharashtra leader, former parliamentarian  .

 It is being said Shinde wanted to relinquish the job and was inactive in the state for quite some time. He also did not attend party conventions in Hamirpur and Kangra recently to discuss strategy for the 2019 polls.
 
 In a communication issued on Tuesday, AICC general secretary Ashok Gehlot said party president Rahul Gandhi appointed Patil to the post with immediate effect. “The party appreciates the hard work and contribution by Shinde, who will be stepping down from his responsibility,” it added.
 
 Shinde was appointed party in-charge for the state last year, right before assembly elections and containing factionalism within the state unit remained a challenge for him from Day 1.
 
 Like Shinde, Patil too will have to try and come over the challenge of factionalism in the state unit to ensure the party’s victory from all four parliamentary seats. In the previous general elections in 2014, Congress lost all four seats to the BJP.
 
 Sukhu said Patil would visit the state soon and future programmes of the party would be made according to her directions. “We would work with her shoulder to shoulder to strengthen the party,” he said.
 
 The replacement at the top has triggered talks of major organizational changes being made in the state unit in near future. On August 2, when Shinde and party co-in charge Ranjeet Ranjan arrived at Peterhoff in Shimla to meet state leaders, supporters of the then chief minister, Virbhadra Singh, raised slogans in favour of their leader and against state president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.
 
 Later, when he held a meeting of Congress workers and leaders in Mandi, Shinde was witness to a face-off between Virbhadra and former Union minister Sukh Ram.
