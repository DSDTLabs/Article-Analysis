MUMBAI: Alarmed by the steady downfall of his party, NCP president   on Saturday stepped in to campaign for the party’s candidates in the crucial  . 

 Speaking in Mankhurd while launching the NCP’s campaign, Pawar slammed the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, saying that the CM can’t escape responsibility from corruption in the BMC. The BJP has been hand-in-glove with the Shiv Sena for over two decades, he said.
 
 Pawar said the Navi Mumbai, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations controlled by NCP were better managed as compared to the BMC. “Devendrabhai has admitted a large number of anti-social elements in BJP. In fact, now they have become clean after joining the BJP,” he said.
 
 Pawar also took a dig at Prime Minister   over demonetisation. “More than 11 crore people had to spend several hours in queues to withdraw their own money,” he said. —Prafulla Marpakwar
