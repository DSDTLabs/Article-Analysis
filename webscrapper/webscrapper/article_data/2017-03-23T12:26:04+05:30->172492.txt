BHAGALPUR: After cancelling the LLB degree of former Delhi law minister  , Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) has decided to make the cancellation notification public.

 Sources said the move is aimed at preventing misrepresentation of facts regarding the AAP MLA’s degree in future. “We also wish to send out the message that we take strict action against wrongdoers,” said an official of the varsity headquartered in Bihar’s Bhagalpur town.
 
 TMBU’s officiating VC   told this correspondent on Wednesday a public communiqué in this regard would be published in newspapers. Asked about the action against the varsity personnel involved in alleged irregularities to help Tomar get the degree, Singh said appropriate legal action against them would follow soon.
 
 Tomar’s degree was cancelled by the Senate of TMBU on Monday after the chancellor of the state universities gave his approval to the Syndicate’s proposal for the same, made in December last year.
 
 Claiming to be a student of   (VSILS), a unit of TMBU, from 1994 to 1998, Tomar secured the degree in September 2012. The alleged fraud came to light after he applied to the   for enrolment as a lawyer in February 2015.
 
 In response to a petition in the Delhi high court, Avadh University (Faizabad), from where Tomar claimed to have graduated, sworn on affidavit that it never awarded Bachelor’s degree to Tomar. This “fake” Bachelor’s degree, incidentally, was the basis of Tomar’s enrolment in the VSILS. 
 
 TMBU authorities also submitted an affidavit in the high court, stating the provisional certificate (number 3687 dated July 29, 1999), which was claimed to be Tomar’s, was in fact issued to one Sanjay  , a BA (Political Sceince) student of TMBU’s R S College.
