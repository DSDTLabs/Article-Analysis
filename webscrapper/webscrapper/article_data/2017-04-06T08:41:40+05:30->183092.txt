PATNA: Patna Women’s College (PWC), a constituent unit of Patna University (PU), has decided not to join the   system prescribed by the university for online admission of students to different undergraduate and PG courses.

 PWC principal Sister Marie Jessie claimed on Tuesday her college as a minority institution enjoyed certain   to run courses and take admissions. “PU can’t force us to join its common admission system,” she asserted.
 
 Sister Jessie said her college would join the PU’s combined entrance test only for BEd admissions in the light of the BEd admission ordinance and regulations approved by the chancellor and also the orders of Patna high court.
 
 The PWC has already announced its schedule for admission to its regular (conventional) and self-financing courses, including BA, BSc and BCom honours. It has also notified its own dates of entrance tests.
 
 The PWC principal expressed anguish over the PU   (as published in TOI recently), cautioning guardians against “illegal” admission of their wards in PWC. She also took exception to a PU communiqué published in newspapers on Tuesday, announcing suspension of PWC admissions for now. “How can the university suspend the process of admission in our college?” she asked.
 
 Incidentally, PU on February 8 formulated an academic calendar of the various courses running in its different colleges and   and decided to have a single window system for undergraduate admissions in all its colleges. However, the PWC announced its own admission schedule. 
 
 The PU authorities later wrote at least three letters to the PWC, urging it to join the common admission system. The letters also made it clear that the defiant colleges would face difficulty in getting their students registered for final university examinations.
