Jodhpur: The busy Jodhpur-Jaipur   route remained interrupted for over two hours on Sunday when a gravel-laden truck was hit by a passenger train in the early hours while attempting to cross an unmanned level crossing. After hitting the truck, the train dragged it for a few metres before halting. Fortunately, there was no casualty. The driver of the truck was injured and is undergoing treatment at MDM Hospital.

 According to SHO (Banar) Jogendra Singh, Marudhar Express coming from Varanasi hit a gravel-laden dumper at about 6 am on Sunday when the dumper was crossing an unmanned level crossing near Banar Kent station on Gujrawas Road, just a few kilometres from Jodhpur Railway Station.
 
 “The collision divided the dumper into two and caused heavy damage to the loco engine injuring both the drivers,” said the official. 
 
 The dumper got stuck in the loco engine and was dragged for a few metres before the train finally stopped. The railways roped in recovery vehicle to bring the train to Jodhpur station.
 
 Police have filed a case against the truck driver for negligent driving and illegal transportation of gravel (bajri), the mining and transportation of which is banned.
 
 Jodhpur-Jaipur Intercity, which departs around the same time for Jaipur from Jodhpur had to be stopped for about two hours until the track was cleared by the railway officials.
