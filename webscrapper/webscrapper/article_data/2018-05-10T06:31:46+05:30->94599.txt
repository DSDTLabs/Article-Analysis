PUNE: Monsoon over a month away, the   dam’s stock depleted to zero on Wednesday and the collective storage of the reservoirs supplying water to the city dropped to 8.07 TMC (27.6%).

 
  
 
 Besides Varasgaon, the Temghar dam has gone dry. The reserve in   is down to 60%, while Khadakwasla holds 83% water stock.
 
 The irrigation department stressed the situation was still not “critical” though the stock was depleting in the dams. An official said the existing stock could meet the city’s water requirements till mid-July. The department pointed out that water could be supplied from the dams to the city till the July-end if it was used judiciously for the next two months.
 
 The city has been drawing about 1,350 MLD water every day from the Khadakwasla dam for the past few days. An official of the irrigation department said the civic administration should continue lifting a similar volume of water from the dams till the end of summer to prevent the situation from becoming critical.
 
 A senior official said, “As of now, we are at a comfort level. But we should be prepared for situations like a delay in arrival of rains or scantly rainfall. It is, therefore, vital to avoid the misuse of water and drawing additional water.”
 
 Though the irrigation department urged for judicious use of water, the data show that the dams have more water storage this year than in 2017 in the same period. On May 9 last year, the dams had 23% (6.88 TMC) water stock — about 1 TMC less than the current stock.
 
 A source said the existing stock could deplete further because the irrigation department was yet to discontinue the release of water — the first of the two rotations planned during summer — in the canal. An irrigation department official said the water release was expected to be stopped in the next five days in a phased manner.
