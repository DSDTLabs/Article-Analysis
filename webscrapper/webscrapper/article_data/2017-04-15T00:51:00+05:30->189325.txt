Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court handed over a case seeking to trace a minor girl to the CB-CID from the Madurai’s Karimedu police. The court however noted there was no wrong with the local police’s investigation and transferred the case to an agency which has state-wide jurisdiction.

 The division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and P Velmurugan passed the order to hand over the investigation after it heard a petition filed by one Barakkath Nisha from Madurai last year. She filed a petition seeking the court’s direction to police, to trace her daughter - Taslima (7), and hand over the child to her.
 
 According to the petitioner, she had in 2011 handed over the minor girl to her father-in-law, Sheik Maideen, who is no more now, from whom her husband S Mohamed Ansari allegedly gave her to the ABODE Precious Children Home in Madurai and thereafter the girl was given to Love and Care Home. She had filed a complaint regarding this with Karimedu police, but no action was taken, Nisha told the court. TNN
