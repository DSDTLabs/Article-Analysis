BHOPAL: Former Congress general secretary   on Friday urged AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi to initiate action against former minister   for dragging senior party leader   in a controversy.

 In a social media campaign, Goyal said, “Verma speaks the language of RSS and it is detrimental for the  .” Though Verma refrained from naming Goa party in-charge Digvijaya Singh while talking to the media after the Congress failed to form government in the state, he alleged that the “political families have taken a contract to destroy Congress”. In a letter to AICC president Sonia Gandhi, Verma, who is considered close to Kamal Nath, said strong action was warranted against such families, members of which hold top posts and are bent on leading the party to its downfall.
 
 In his Facebook post, Goyal said the unity of Digivjaya Singh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia would make Congress fight against the BJP in 2018 elections, but such outbursts (like Verma’s) would harm the party. He said Verma should refrain from such acts just to hog the limelight. This is not the time to point accusing finger, but to keep quiet and work hard to strengthen the party in the state. This is not for the first time that Verma, who had served as a minister in Digvijaya Singh cabinet in his second tenure, has criticised him. He had even opposed Singh when he was being nominated to the Rajya Sabha.
