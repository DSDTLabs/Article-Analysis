Mangaluru: A total 11   from Kadaba in Puttur taluk of Dakshina Kannada district embraced Buddhism.

 They were converted to Buddhism in the presence of Dalit Sangharsha Samiti Puttur taluk organizing convener Ananda Mithabail and Dakshina Kannada district Bouddha Mahasabha leader Sugathapala Bhantheji. A conversion ceremony was held during the house warming ceremony of a villager in Alankaru village on Thursday.
 
 Bhantheji performed Buddha Puja and offered dharmopadesha to 11 Dalits as per Buddhist scriptures. Dalit community members Puttanna, Susheela, Nayana Kumar, Namitha, Sathish Kumar, Prema, Harsha, Susheela, Vishwanath, Manoj Kumar and Ganesh embraced Buddhism on the occasion. After being converted, Nayan Kumar will be accepting ‘Brahmacharya’. After the conversion, all of them took an oath that they will try to inculcate the values taught by Dr B R Ambedkar and fulfil the dreams of prof B Krishnappa. 
 
 Ananda Mithabail told reporters that those Dalits who were exploited by Hindus were converted to Buddhism. “This is not the first instance where Dalits are being converted to Buddhism in Dakshina Kannada district. Many Dalit leaders and their family members have already embraced Buddhism in the district. I embraced Buddhism seven years ago and received a confirmation letter recently. Conversions will not deprive us of our rights and benefits that we are receiving under the Dalit category,” he said, adding that Nayan Kumar, who has read Buddhist texts, will be propagating Buddhism.
