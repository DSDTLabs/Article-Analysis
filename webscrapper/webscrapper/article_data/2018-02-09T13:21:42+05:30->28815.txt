PATNA: Bateshwar Ganga Pump Nahar Pariyojana canal in Bhagalpur, which faced a breach in its wall a day before its formal inauguration by chief minister   on September 20 last year, is likely to be inaugurated within a week. The CM, who reviewed implementation of different government schemes at   on Thursday, told the officials that he was ready to inaugurate the canal next week.

 Water resources department minister   asked officials concerned to start trial run of the canal project to ensure its timely inauguration.
 
 Water had gushed into Kahalgaon and inundated areas in   township and some civil areas after the breach over a stretch of 15-ft in the 11km long canal during the trial run held before its previously scheduled inauguration.
 
 The CM also asked senior officials to commence land acquisition for proposed Vikasmshila University at Bhagalpur. “Hold talks with landowners to pave way for acquisition of the required land,” the CM told officials and elected representatives.
 
 The CM instructed officials to start work on setting up rainwater harvesting units, so as to ensure sufficient water in Banka and neighbouring areas. He also instructed senior officials to ensure compulsory retirement of those government staff who are facing action for faltering in providing services to residents within set timeframe under   Right to Public Services (RTPS) Act.
 
 Energy department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit told the CM that work was in full swing to provide electricity to 2,008 of 3,308 habitations in Bhagalpur and Banka districts by April this year.
 
 The chief minister also reviewed government schemes of Purnia division covering Purnia, Araria, Kishanganj and Katihar districts in the evening.
