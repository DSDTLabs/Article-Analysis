 Asked who was harassing the family, Anuj said, "I don't want to name anyone. I don't want to say anything further and neither do my family members."
 
 On how the press briefing came to be held, Katke said, "We approached advocate Amit Naik as we wanted to brief the media." He also said the Loyas have accepted "that the (judge's) death was due to heart attack".
 
 Naik said, "What Anuj wants to convey, as I have been instructed, is to let this issue remain non-controversial, as there is no controversy and it need not be politicised." The press briefing was held at Naik's office.
