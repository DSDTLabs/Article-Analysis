NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Two candidates filed their   on Day 2 of the UP assembly nomination process in Gautam Budh Nagar district but the first day’s dry run continued at the collectorate office in Raj Nagar, Ghaziabad.

  candidate Vedram Bhati filed nomination papers for the Jewar seat while Anoop Khanna, a social activist, filed papers as an independent candidate for the   assembly constituency on Wednesday.
 
 Kumar Vineet, additional district magistrate and deputy district election officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that some more people have taken the nomination forms but were yet to submit them. 
 
 “The candidates can file the nomination papers by January 24. We will scrutinise the nomination papers on January 25,” he said. The candidates have until January 27 to withdraw their applications.
 
 Bhati, a sitting MLA from Jewar, he had polled 67,524 votes in 2012 assembly election and defeated Congress candidate Dhirendra Singh by 9,500 votes. Khanna, president of the district chemists’ association, had also participated in the 2012 Noida assembly election and managed to get a few hundred votes. However, this time Khanna hopes to perform better.
 
 Bhati, who also held the position of a cabinet minister in the previous BSP government, said that when his party was in power, there was development in the state and also in Gautam Budh Nagar district. 
 
 “The BSP led massive development of the city, which even our rivals admit. On the other hand, the Samajwadi Party has worked for development of only Saifai village — the birth place of Mulayam Singh Yadav,” he said. “We are hopeful that this time BSP will return to power and will again take the state on the developmental path.”
