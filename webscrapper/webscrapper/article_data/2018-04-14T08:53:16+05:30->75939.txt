CHANDIGARH: Close on the heels of a cash-for-jobs scam being unearthed in the   (HSSC), four youths from   district alleged on Friday that investigations in a similar case registered in   last year were biased.

 The youths accused the police of shielding a Panchkula couple who duped the group of six of Rs 26 lakh, on the pretext of getting them jobs through HSSC. Ajay, Sandeep Kumar, Narinder Singh and  , who claimed they were cheated by the couple, raised the issue before Panchkula commissioner of police. They said they were promised the jobs of tracer-cum-subinspectors in the irrigation department, advertised by HSSC in 2013.
 
 They alleged that police had initially booked one Suraj Bhan, a resident of Sonipat, Mukesh Saini, a teacher of Kalka, and Panchkula’s Rajbir Singh Chauhan and his wife,  . Police had arrested Suraj in January 2017 and filed a charge sheet against him. Arrested on Thursday, Mukesh is in police custody. “Despite the fact that Saini and Suraj had confirmed that money was with Rajbir and his wife, police gave a clean chit to them. Even now, Mukesh has said a major part of the money is with the couple. Police are not taking any action,” Ajit said.
 
 Seconding him, Narinder alleged that he and his parents were harassed by the police on the account of recording their statements. “They would call us to police station and would make us sit. All this is happening as the couple has links with HSSC officials and is able to influence two of the complainants,” he said.
 
 When contacted, CP Chawla expressed inability to comment on the matter. “Let me check the facts on file. One thing is sure: the accused will not be spared,” he said.
