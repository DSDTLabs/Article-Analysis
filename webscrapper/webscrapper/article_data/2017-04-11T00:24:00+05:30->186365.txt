Indore: The Prestige Education Society told Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court that it has not flouted any land use policy norms.

 The education society on Monday replied to a petition that alleged flouting of land use policy norms by educational institutions of the city.
 
 It told the court it was allotted the land for educational purposes and it used the land for the same purpose. However, the petitioner has alleged that while the land was allotted to the trust for high school, it had constructed the building and had given it on rent to the school and the college without running them directly.
 
 The division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice Virendra Singh granted four weeks to Indore municipal corporation and state government to file their replies in the petition. 
 
 The petition filed by advocate Manohar Dalal on behalf of Jay Saraf, challenges similar flouting of land use norms by the two other trusts- Jain Divakar Vidya Niketan and Rajesh Joshi Malviya Samaj Vidya Niketan Society.
 
  “The plots were given to the trusts at very reasonable cost and the government has not paid attention to whether the land reserved for educational purposes is actually being used for the same purpose or not,” said the petitioner counsel Manohar Dalal. 
 
 The Rajesh Joshi Malviya Samaj Vidya Niketan Society also submitted its reply to the petition on Monday. However, a copy of the same was not provided to the petitioners. The society has been accused of running a godown on the land allotted for educational purpose. The godown has been given to transporters and other contractors.
