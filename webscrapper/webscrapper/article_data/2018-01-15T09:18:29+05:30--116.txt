PATNA: People of state might be facing difficulties due to extreme cold conditions, but three doctors from the city are more than happy that they participated in the   Peace Prize giving ceremony and other related events held at Oslo (Norway) in freezing conditions last month.

 A seven-member delegation of Indian doctors associated with Indian Doctors for Peace and Development (IDPD), including three from the city, were invited to participate in the function to give Nobel Peace Prize to International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons ( ), a civil society group. 
 
 Dr  , a city doctor and member of the Indian delegation, said torchlight walk to celebrate the Nobel Peace Prize was a magical experience. “People gathered at 5.30pm at   station in the freezing cold conditions, holding torches and candles in their hands. As the temperature plunged to several degrees below zero degree Celsius, it prompted the organisers to provide woollen caps to those walkers who had nothing to protect their heads from snowfall,” he said, adding two members of the Indian delegation were among those who were without a woollen cap.
 
 The Indian delegation included Dr Shakeel, Dr Satyajit Singh and Dr Bibha Singh (all from Patna), Dr S S Soodan (Jammu and Kashmir), Dr Arun Mitra ( ), Dr   (Maharashtra) and Dr   (Manipur).
