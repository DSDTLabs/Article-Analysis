PUNE: When inside an ATM kiosk, watch your space, check for lurking eyes and cover your hand while punching your PIN, is the constant advise doled out by banks and cyber security experts. Even so, people in the city are falling for tricks and losing a lot of money. 

 Two unidentified men inside an ATM kiosk at   in Pimpri tricked a 26-year-old nurse, exchanged her debit card and used it to withdraw Rs 69,000 from her account on May 8.
 
 The duo saw the woman pressing the PIN numbers for her transaction. On the pretext of picking up a pen from the floor, they pushed her. The unsuspecting woman’s card fell on the floor. 
 
 They deftly exchanged her card with another card and the woman without realising that it was not hers, took it and left the kiosk. The suspects then used her card and PIN number to effect the withdrawals, police said.
 
 The woman lodged a complaint with the Pimpri police on Saturday and an offence under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered. 
 
 Pimpri police’s senior inspector   told TOI that the woman works as a nurse in a private hospital and has an account in a public sector bank. “On May 8, around 3pm, she had gone to an ATM kiosk at Udaynagar in Pimpri to withdraw cash,” he said.
 
 Mugalikar said when the woman was inside the kiosk, the two men were already there. “After withdrawing the money, while the woman was putting back the debit card into her purse, one of them threw his pen down. In an attempt to pick it up, the suspect gently pushed the woman,” he added. 
 
 Her debit card fell on the floor and the suspect immediately picked it up and handed it over to the woman. She kept it in her purse and left the kiosk,   said.
 
 Later, the woman began receiving messages from the bank about the withdrawal of cash from her account. “Within a few minutes Rs 69,000 was withdrawn from her account. When she checked her debit card, she realised it was not hers,” he said.
