CHENNAI: Six months after the   (TRB) recruitment scam rocked Tamil Nadu, the cybercrime police identified at least 196 beneficiaries of the fraud, but are yet to charge errant candidates in the case.

 
 Though 17 people have been arrested in the racket and many detained under the Goondas Act, candidates who paid money for higher marks have escaped the dragnet. Many candidates said their marks were manipulated without their knowledge.
 
 Of the 1.33 lakh candidates who took the TRB examination for the post of lecturer in government polytechnics, 2,100 made it to the final selection list. But the entire list was scrapped on allegations of largescale corruption. A probe showed OMR sheets and marks of at least 196 candidates were tampered by an agency handling data entry operations for the TRB.
 
 “The investigation is stuck, as cash trail involving candidates, mediators and TRB officials is yet to be clearly established,” said S  , a lawyer.
 
 A ‘victim’, one of the students who are not among the 196 beneficiaries of the fraud, said: “There’s no clarity in the probe. They recorded statements of errant candidates instead of treating them as part of the scam. How can someone increase their marks without their consent or knowledge?”
 
 After the Madras high court took up the issue, the examination was scrapped. Final orders are awaited. But in the past five months, the TRB has had four heads. “This has raised doubts among the victims of the exam,” said Karthikeyan. Candidates who describe themselves as collateral victims in the scam and are seeking   probe in the case. They have posted details of candidates who used forged marksheets to qualify for the certificate verification.
 
 The police have charged the culprits with forgery and cheating under the IT Act.
 
 A cab driver, Ganesh, of  , was the first to be arrested, on December 27. Shail  , of Datatec Methodex Pvt Ltd, Delhi, surrendered before a magistrate on January 6.
