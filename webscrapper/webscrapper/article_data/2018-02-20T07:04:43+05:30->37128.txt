CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister   on Monday announced to conduct student bodies’ elections in colleges and universities for 2018-19 academic session 2018-19 in September.

 After a period of two decades, Haryana will see students’ polls. The students’ elections were banned by then chief minister Bansi Lal in 1997 following incidents of violence.
 
 Captain Bhupinder, officer on special duty attached with CM Khattar, said the decision to that effect had been taken after the recommendation of a committee constituted to study the issues involved in the student bodies’ polls.
 
 “The CM has taken this decision in view of the promise made in the election manifesto. Further, various discussions were held on the subject with different student organizations in the past,” said Captain Bhupinder.
 
 Meanwhile, the announcement has evoked sharp reactions from the student organizations associated with the Congress and the INLD.
 
 Divyanshu Budhiraja, president of the Haryana unit of the student wing of the Congress—National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), termed it as a misleading announcement. “Firstly, this has come after the gap of more than three and half years. Secondly, the government has not clarified as whether there will be direct or indirect elections. The education minister has strongly suggested online polling. Hence, the government must first clarify this,” said Budhiraja.
 
 Meanwhile, the INLD’s student wing INSO’s chief   asked the CM or the governor to come out with a written assurance about student bodies’ elections. “They are doing all this for the past three years. Now what we need is an official notification from the office of the chancellor and all protocols related to the elections, like amendment in the university calenders, to be followed. This has to be a totally transparent system,” said Digvijay.
