NEW DELHI: Family members of the 10-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by serial rapist   in December had quietly gone back to living their lives after   for some time. However, when the police approached them on Friday to identify the paedophile, they were in for a huge shock.

 The survivor’s mother said that she lost hope when the police became clueless about who had sexually assaulted their little girl and the suspects pointed out by her had been given a clean chit.
 
 On December 12, despite being sexually assaulted on her way back from school, the 10-year-old had managed to reach home. “She refused to go to school for the next two days and remained unusually quiet. When we pestered her, she broke down and told us about the assault. I was shocked to hear about her ordeal,” said her mother.
 
 The man had even threatened to harm the girl if she told anyone about the incident. “We were shocked to know that the man wanted to meet her the next time he visited Delhi. He had asked her to quietly leave home and meet him outside her school the next weekend,” said a family member.
 
 The second victim’s mother said, “My daughter and her neighbourhood friend were returning from tuitions when he accosted them. He told my daughter that her father had ordered new clothes from the shop he worked at. He asked them to accompany him to his workshop so that he could measure them.”
 
 He took them to an under-construction building and asked them to come under the stairs. Sensing something amiss, the 10-year-old started shouting for help. “He first tried to gag her, but then fled towards the Kondli canal,” said a relative.
 
 Police said that though records exist for six such incidents since 2004, they suspect more gruesome tales. “He targeted children of poor and migrant labourers who would not register police cases. We are trying to find more victims,” said an officer.
