'Baywatch' star   says a good sense of humour is the sexiest quality in a partner. The 27-year-old   says her ideal romantic partner would be similar to her love interest in the upcoming action comedy, which is based on the popular '90s television series of the same name.

  
  
 "Originally, my romantic interest (in the movie), played by Jon Bass, is a   type. It was written that he had a big crush on (C J)."
 
 "I kept thinking, I would love this guy. I would hook up with him. He's the funniest character, and to me, humour is the sexiest thing," Kelly said.
