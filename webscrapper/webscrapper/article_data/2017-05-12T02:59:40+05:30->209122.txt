NOIDA: Residents and commuters have to wait for three more months for a signal-free ride in Noida’s Sector 60 as the Rs 60-crore project near   intersection is facing yet another delay. Initially expected to be completed by December 2016, the deadline was shifted to June 2017, and the project is now chasing a new completion date of August 2017.

 However, to provide relief to commuters, two diversions put in place by the authorities nearly six months ago will be removed by May 22. 
 
 Once complete, the 700-metre-long flyover with three lanes on each carriageway, in combination with other underpasses in its vicinity, is expected to provide signal-free connectivity between Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad.
 
 According to   officials, the facility is almost 72% complete. “To reduce traffic congestion, we plan to remove the traffic diversions placed near   in Sector 66 within the next 15 days,” Garg said. “A six-lane, two-carriageway road over an under-construction   at the crossing will be open to public on May 22, which will allow traffic to move in all four directions,” he said.
 
 Officials said road No. 6 will have four underpasses, which are expected to bring much-needed relief to commuters as the stretch sees heavy traffic daily. While an underpass near NH-24 has been opened to traffic, work on the underpass at Mamura Chowk will begin this year. Another underpass is proposed at the intersection near Sector 71.
 
 For commuters going from Ashram in Delhi via the DND flyway, Atta underpass and towards Chijarsi linking to NH-24, travel will be a breeze once all the underpasses are in place.
