A country-made pistol, an empty cartridge and a motorcycle have been recovered from the possession of the arrested persons,” Gaya SSP Rajeev Mishra said.
 
 The SSP added the incident occurred when the toll plaza employees were about to enter the PNB branch at Amas. “Police reached the spot soon after getting information and gave a hot chase to the criminals. In panic, they took a wrong road and reached Pathra village where the locals challenged them. Two of them were later arrested by police with the help of the villagers,” the SSP said.
