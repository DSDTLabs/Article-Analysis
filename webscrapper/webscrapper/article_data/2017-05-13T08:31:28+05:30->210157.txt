THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition staged yet another walkout from the Assembly over Munnar anti-encroachment drive on Friday, this time after alleging that the government had lost its collective responsibility in the drive to evict encroachers. 

 Denied an adjournment motion moved by senior   leader P T Thomas on the issue, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that all the eviction procedures had come to a standstill following the tussle between the CPM and the CPI, and that the CPM leaders were the major encroachers.
 
 Asserting that mere announcements wouldn't suffice in the anti-encroachment drive, Chennithala asked whether the government is ready to evict M M Lambodharan (M M  's brother) and   (a member of Zachariah's family). 
 
 Earlier, replying to the adjournment motion, revenue minister E Chandrasekharan said that the government was committed to protect Munnar from encroachments, and rubbished the allegations of 'chief minister's interferences in eviction procedures' as mere propaganda. "The chief minister has every power to hear complaints from aggrieved parties, ask for clarifications and give suggestions," he said.
 
 On the allegations by P T Thomas that the government was backtracking from notifying   in   'to help encroachers including Joyce George MP, who has encroached 32 acres of land in the area', the minister said the government was only examining whether there is any old settlements in the area before coming out with the final notification.
 
 As the House witnessed heated arguments over the Congress leader's repeated mention of Joyce George's encroachment, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan intervened and said these allegations were being made to create a smokescreen when the government was set to distribute title deeds on May 21.
