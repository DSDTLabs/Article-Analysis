 Prathyaksha’s father B G Ramakrishna, a BSNL employee, is elated by his daughter’s gesture.
 
 Mallamma went on a three-dayfastto gether family to agree to build a toilet at home in Danapura village of Koppal district. Open defecation was unavoidable in Danapura where 80% of the 300 households had no toilet. Women in the village wait for nightfall before going to answer nature’s call.
 
 “I’m not just inspired by Mallamma’s efforts but am determined to do something concretefor thecause. I’lldedicate my fee to build toilets in Mallamma’s village,” said Prathyaksha, a theatre artiste since childhood. This is her debut movie.
 
 She spent over 40 days in Danapura for the movie shooting. The stay opened her eyes to the village’s toilet travails. The teenager’s gesture has rubbed off on the film crew. “We want to join her in the cause. We’ll chip in to construct toilets,” said movie director Ajay Kumar A J.
 
 “The government offers Rs 10,000 to people after constructing toilets. But Danapura residents need money to build them,” another crew member added.
 
 The film crew plans to build at least 100 toilets in the village. The cost of building a home toilet is about Rs 10,000-12,000. Ajay Kumar said work will begin after the film’s releasein May. The ending of the film will be shot next month.
