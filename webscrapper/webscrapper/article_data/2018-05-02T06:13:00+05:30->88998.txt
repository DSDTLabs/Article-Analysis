A 19-year-old boy was feared drowned in the Ganga Canal here in   on Tuesday. The boy has been identified as Akram, a student of an   college in Hapur. His body could not be retrieved after seven hours of combing operation in a two-kilometre stretch. The cops sought the help of the deep divers of the National Disaster Response Force (8th battalion) in the rescue operation. The rescue operation had to be halted in the evening after dark, and according to an NDRF official, it would resume following orders from the district administration.

 According to witnesses, seeing some younger kids making a dive in deeper parts of the canal, he also tried to do the same. However, the water flow was quite strong and he could not come back to the bank. 
 
 SHO (Masuri) Aparna Gautam said, “A joint team of cops and NDRF has been pressed in the rescue mission. However, the team has not been able to locate the body.” tnn
