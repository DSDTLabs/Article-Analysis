Movement of such unseaworthy vessels is prohibited as per the ISPS Code and the notifications of director general of shipping,“ read a statement issued by the port.
 
 “It is surprising to note that such corroded unseaworthy vessels were given license renewals and allowed to run posing danger to everyone. This incident point fingers to the fact that allowing such irresponsibly handled unseaworthy condition vessels could be a cause for security hazards in future and hence proper registration and monitoring system has to be implemented by registering authorities,“ the statement said .
