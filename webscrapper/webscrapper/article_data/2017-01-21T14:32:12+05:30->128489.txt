Piyush and Vaidehi's ring ceremony takes place. This upsets Roshni to the extent that she tells Vaidehi that she won't let the wedding happen.
 
 For the first time, Vaidehi counters her and stands strong against her. Piyush and Vaidehi get clicked together and everyone is overjoyed. 
  
 On the other hand, Saroj is suspicious of Anjali's every effort to win them over. She stops her from giving sweets to Sanjeev, but Anjali assures her that she got everything cooked as per her father in law's needs. 
 
 
  
 Saroj still can't overcome Anjali's past and feels skeptical about her behaviour. Will Anjali be able to change Saroj's heart?
