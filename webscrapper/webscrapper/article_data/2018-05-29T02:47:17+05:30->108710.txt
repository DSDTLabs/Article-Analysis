MUMBAI: After seizing prescription drugs worth over Rs 200 crore during raids at four companies in Western India in the past three years, the   (NCB) is intensifying its crackdown on  . 

 The investigators had found that the four companies were linked to online sale of medicines, without prescriptions, to customers in Europe and the US. The US is a global leader where it comes to abuse of prescription drugs. 
 
 NCB sleuths said that scamsters are constantly coming up with innovative ways of dodging law enforcers. 
 
 “We have largely dependent on specific inputs or tip-offs to crack down on offenders. We intend to increase crackdowns by forming special teams that can comb the internet for advertisements issued by illegal internet pharmacies. Small time courier companies that ship parcels of prescription drugs will also be under the scanner,” said an official. The huge presence of   in Maharashtra makes it a hub for this type of offence.
 
 For customers in the West, India is a preferred supplier. "A strip of medication in the US would cost between $10 to $30 but illegal internet pharmacies sell them at half the price without prescriptions," an official said. Payments are received through wire transfers. 
 
 In a bust made by the NCB in Surat, payment was received through Bitcoins.
 
 Between 2015 and 2017, the NCB raided four companies—Provizer Pharma, Dolphin Pharma, KC Pharma & Euphoria, Shree Malabalee Pvt. Ltd—in Gujarat and Maharashtra, and 15 arrests were made. The value of prescription medicines seized the former three was over Rs200 crore. "We had conducted a raid on Provizer Pharma in Surat in 2015. 
 
 It was found that a group of pharmacy graduates had come together to do business. They floated five fake firms and were sending products abroad through couriers on forged addresses. They sold medicines legally as well as illegally. Approximately 11 lakh tablets were seized," said  , zonal director of NCB, Ahmedabad.
