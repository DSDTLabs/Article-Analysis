Belagavi: While   is turning into a haven for  , the  , despite several measures, has failed in preventing their supply to youths.

 While ganja is widely circulated with the new code word of ‘course’,   ( ) is the latest drug gaining popularity among college students.
 
 While suppliers provide drugs in huge quantities outside Belagavi, some college students from poor family background are involved in their distribution in small amounts at the narrow passages and playgrounds in the city. Sardars School Ground, RPD College Road, Jail School area, Angol and Khadak Galli have reportedly gained notoriety in this regard.
 
 Despite these developments, very few cases are registered. While 2016 saw only 13 cases booked in the city police commissionerate limits, last year the figure was 17. APMC police station limits registered 10 cases.
 
 Social activist Vinayak Naykoji told TOI that ganja is grown in some villages of Belagavi South constituency. “It is sold in small quantities. One cannot get more than 200gm from the growers so that cops ignore the cases. But such cases are in large numbers in Belagavi. In some colleges, youths have popularized ganja with the code word ‘score’. Ganja-addicted college students themselves are involved in distributing them free of cost. Colleges need to sensitize students on the ill-effects of drugs,” he said.
 
 D C Rajappa, police commissioner, said, “I have instructed officers to keep a vigil at all colleges to get the details. Instructions have also been given to book cases against consumers to bust the rackets.”
