 Even passengers told TOI that they were unaware of the lodge. When contacted, senior railway manager   said the lounge was opened regularly and that it re mained closed when the two trains were not scheduled to arrive or depart from the city.“The lounge is available to passengers of executive class free of cost,“ she said.
 
 When TOI visited the station on Monday , it found the lounge was locked and executive passengers were waiting outside or in the normal cloakroom at the station. The passengers were not aware of the facility's availability at the station.
 
 According to a railway official, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) was to maintain the lounge. However, it had not taken the responsibility so far.   said they had sent a communication to IRCTC to manage the executive lodge at the station. “We have not got any response from them to date,“ Gaur added.
 
 Even at the time of its inauguration, the lodge had come under controversy . While inaugurating the lodge, Kher was upset when she found that there was no air-conditioner (AC). When she asked the offici als whether there was any provision for air conditioning, an official got confused and responded that there was   in the lodge. But when Kher asked about its location, a senior functionary intervebed and said the lodge was non-AC.
