COLVA: Former Nuvem MLA Francisco Xavier ‘Mickky’   on Saturday demanded the resignation of Betalbatim sarpanch Constancio  , for asking the local parish priest to caution villagersparents in particularabout the possibility of their wards doing drugs.

 Pacheco said the announcement, made at Our Lady of Remedios Church, Betalbatim, last Sunday, had brought a bad name to the village and had created doubts in parents’ minds.
 
 “If the sarpanch had concrete evidence of the youth consuming drugs, he should have gone to their houses to warn their parents, or given their names to the police. By withholding information, the sarpanch is abetting the criminal activity,” Pacheco said.
 
 When contacted, Miranda said he did not wish to comment on Pacheco’s allegations.
