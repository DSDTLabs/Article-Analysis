NAGPUR: Tiger population in   (TATR) and its buffer, which is considered as one of the potential source populations of  , has recorded 69 tigers, including 48 individuals in core area.

 The latest report by   (WII), Dehradun, titled ‘Long-term monitoring of tigers, co-predators and prey species in TATR & adjoining landscape’, under Phase IV monitoring estimates presence of 86 tigers covering an area of 1,700 sqkm. The estimation was done from January-May 2016 and report was submitted recently.
 
 Principal investigators included  , PCCF Vinay Sinha, CCF GP Garad and Parag Nigam.
 
 Of the 86 tigers estimated, 69 separate individuals have been captured on camera traps. These include 48 in core and 17 in buffer while four tigers used both core and buffer areas. During last monitoring in 2015, 71 tigers were recorded with an estimation of 88 tigers. This included 51 in core and 14 in buffer and six shared common territory.
 
 “However, couple of tiger numbers going down is not an indication of any loss. It sets a trend that the park cannot hold more than 48-50 tigers. There were deaths of two tigers last year — one outside Kolsa and another Kolara,” said GP Garad, CCF & field director of TATR.
 
 Garad added that more tigers can be added to core area if Kolsa, Rantalodi and Palasgaon villages are relocated. “Palasgaon relocation is in process and 150 hectare area, which will be vacated, will add to at least 3-4 tigers,” he said.
 
 Garad explained that with core area limited to 625 sqkm, Tadoba tigers are dispersing in buffer with number going up from 14 to 17. “Though it was possible due to better protection and water management, I feel enhanced tiger numbers in buffer, where there are 90 villages, will intensify man-animal conflict.”
 
 Even WII scientist Bilal Habib admitted that Tadoba tiger population has reached a saturation point but is very dynamics. If last three years numbers from 2013-16 are considered, they are trending between 48 and 51. Similarly, in buffer, the number has gone up from 10 to 17 during the same period. Besides, territory of some 4-6 tigers is overlapping. There is little probability of more increase in buffer area as compared to core.
 
 Habib further added that the long-term monitoring of this population will help in understanding tiger dynamics in a much better way. 
 
 The WII report shows that density per 100 sqkm is estimated to be 5.64 tigers for TATR. It is not only about high tiger density but density of herbivores like sambar, chital, wild boars, gaurs, barking deer, langurs have also increased during the last three years when WII has been monitoring the landscape intensively as part of the project.
 
 The overall density of major prey species includes gaur 2.64/sqkm, sambar 3.47/sqkm, chital 8.48/sqkm, wild-boar 4.19/sqkm, langur 10.32/sqkm, barking deer 1.16/sqkm and nilgai 0.42/sqkm.
