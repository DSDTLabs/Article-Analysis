 "My sister is a diabetic. She usually returns home from work by 8pm. On March 16, she left home saying she would be late. But when she did not return even after 10pm, we got worried," her sister   told TOI. "I suspect something is amiss because her two of her colleagues claim she was with them till Lamington Road. Why did they not say anything to their seniors when she did not reach office?" Senior inspector   said, "We are verifying the details with her friends and colleagues.
