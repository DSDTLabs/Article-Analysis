Bengaluru-based Theatre Company ‘Tahatto’ was recently seen in the city with a curious piece of drama called  . Comprising stories imagined and written as urban folktales, the play explored what it means to hold on to our stories and fairytales. The 80-minute play enthralled the audience with five urban folktales — Watching an Audience Watch a Play, ZenTen, The   Remembers, Everybody needs an Imaginary Friend and The Woman Who Lost Her Stories. 
The writer-director of the play   says, “Our city spaces, with its rapidly diminishing attention spans, seem to be devoid of stories. Maybe we don’t have the time for stories; maybe we'd notice them if someone would convert them into memes for us. Or maybe, we don't believe that cities can hide fairytales in plain sight.” 
 The show kicked off with the play Watching an Audience Watch a Play. As the title suggests, the play was about a group of actors who were watching an audience, as opposed to the other way round. This was followed by ZenTen, a play on how perfect would a relationship be, if we have access to an app that allows going 10 seconds back in time and undo every mistake. 
 Up next were The Pied Piper Remembers, a fresh take on the classic folk story — Pied Piper. Everybody needs an Imaginary Friend was a story on what happens if you are visited by one of your childhood imaginary friend, whom you had forgotten about. 
 The show concluded with the play The Woman who lost her Stories, in which a woman wakes up one day and realises that she has lost all her stories. How she manages to get them back forms the crux of the story. Actors Nithya J Rao, Deepthi Bhaskar, Kalyani Kumar, Badarivishal Kinhal, RJ Jimmy Xavier, Piyush Agarwal, Prashanth Nair and   enacted multiple roles, mesmerising the audience.
