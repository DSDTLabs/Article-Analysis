CHENNAI: The extra fuel the planes diverted from Chennai on   guzzled could have taken a plane with more than 500 passengers to London and back, three flights to Dubai and back and six flights to Delhi and back.

 Though Bhogi-related diversions happen annually, airlines did not reschedule in advance and   took it casually. Around 90 tonnes of fuel must have been burned by flights for diversions on Saturday in one of the biggest disruptions in recent times at Chennai airport. Sixteen flights, including nine international services, were diverted to Bengaluru and Hyderabad. While a few planes were alerted before they were near Chennai, others flew in circles for close to 20 minutes waiting for visibility to improve before deciding on another airport.
 
 
 Though fuel consumption varies depending on the type of engine, size of the plane, and the load it is carries, pilots say it would take approximately three tonnes fuel to reach Hyderabad,
 
 which is an hour from Chennai. And an A32O or   737 may burn 2.5 tonnes to three tonnes per hour while a B787 may burn four tonnes during cruise if wind is favourable and if the plane gets a higher altitude. The loss also included aircraft operating costs, crew time, meals and hotels, payment for handling planes at the diverted airport, fees to the ground handler, delay of return flight and associated cancellation by passengers. Most of the diverted flights returned only in the afternoon. This means passengers from Dubai saw their total time spent travelling double as they spent four hours or more on waiting which is equivalent to flying time.
 
 The loss of time and fuel could have been avoided if small airports like Puducherry, Vellore and   had better facilities. Though these airports are closer than Bengaluru and Hyderabad, they cannot be used for diversions because their runways are short and facilities are inadequate to handle big planes.
