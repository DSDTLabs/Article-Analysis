It has been one of the most-hyped serials on Kannada  . With a star like Sudeep backing it, 
 has clearly been one of the biggest projects mounted on vernacular  . And while the daily soap has been raking in the TRPs, news now is that  , the original director of the show, has been replaced by  , another television veteran.
In fact, the grapevine had been abuzz for a while now about this possibility. However, sources from the channel had remained non-committal on the issue and had shared that since it was a mega serial, a lot of ground work was required and hence, the cast and crew were on a schedule break. “Discussions are also on and a detailed plan is being made,” added the sources. 
 However, now confirmation comes in that Gadda Viji has indeed moved on and Dilip has taken over. “But unlike what it’s made out to be, there is no controversy. We are just going with the initial agreement of Gadda Viji being roped in to helm 20 episodes. Now that we have wrapped 20 episodes, Dilip has stepped in. We did request Gadda Viji to continue, but since he has his cinematic commitments, he had to move on. His absence will not affect the quality of the serial,” says  , fiction head of the show.
 Gadda Viji meanwhile points out that it was part of the plan to highlight his association with the project to grab eyeballs. “Even though it had been fixed right at the beginning that I’d be helming a limited set of episodes, we didn’t want to publicize the issue because it is a big serial and we can’t tell audiences I’d be moving on after that, as it would cause unnecessary confusion,” he states. He adds, “Yes, rumours like I had quit after three episodes had reached my ears, too. But that’s not true. I have a film coming up and I just helped with the launch of the project. Somebody able has taken over and I’m glad the transition has been smooth.”
