NEW DELHI: The   party's Manish   today chose to remind his Punjab colleague   that "he had himself demonstrated how the EVMs can be gerrymandered," ANI reported.

 Tewari likely meant "tampered with" and not gerrymandered, but he brought up the issue after Singh bunged a spanner in the works of an almost united opposition's campaign against these electronic voting machines, or EVMs. They allege that the machines have been "altered" so any vote cast automatically goes in favour of the BJP.
 
 Singh, the man considered responsible for the Congress' victory in the recently concluded Assembly elections in Punjab, said that if EVMs had indeed been 'fixed', he would not have been able to win in Punjab. The Congress won 77 of 117 seats in the state making a noteworthy comeback after a decade.
 
 "The Chief Minister of Punjab is a respected leader, but few years back in 2010 and even in 2001, when he was the PCC ( ) president, he had himself demonstrated as to how the EVMs can be gerrymandered," Tewari told ANI.
 
 Tewari had strong words against the   (ECI) as well. 
 
 "It's extremely unfortunate that the Election Commission has taken upon itself the role of being the lawyer for the EVMs. Democracy is based upon public trust. It is based upon confidence which elected representatives have in the process. So, therefore, if there is a lack of confidence in the EVMs, why is the Election Commission holding itself as the advocate of the EVMs? What is the difficulty if the ECI agrees to hold elections by paper ballot?" said Tewari to ANI.
 
 Earlier today, Congress leader   also tweeted against the EC.
