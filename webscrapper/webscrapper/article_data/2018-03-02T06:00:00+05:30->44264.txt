 is furious and not without reason. The posters of the recently launched Tollywood film   4 featured the actress in them whereas she is apparently not part of the project. “I would like to clarify that I am not doing Dandupalyam 4. This is a joke! No one has even approached me or my associates regarding the same, how can anyone use my name or picture without my consent? As I am not a part of this project, I request the makers to keep my name and pictures out of any news regarding the film,” said Pooja Gandhi. 

 The 2012 crime-drama Dandupalyam (Dandupalya in  ) starring Pooja Gandhi in the lead was a massive success and led to two more successful sequels. While the third part is scheduled for a release soon, Dandupalyam 4 was recently launched in the direction of debutant KT Nayak. None of the cast of the first three parts including Pooja Gandhi, Makarand Deshpande and   are part of Dandupalyam 4 and more importantly, the ‘captain of the ship’of the first three parts, Srinivas   not coming on board has sparked off rumours of a fallout with the makers of the fourth part. Raju however laughs off the rumours. “There's absolutely no question of a fallout. I had made up my mind a couple of years ago that Dandupalyam will end with the trilogy. I have travelled with the series for so long and I'm mentally exhausted with it. Neither the members of the cast from the first three parts nor the cinematographer is part of Dandupalyam 4. As far as I'm concerned, the fourth part is just an attempt to cash in on the brand name," said Raju who is busy finalising the script for his next film which will have Sharwanand essaying the lead role.
