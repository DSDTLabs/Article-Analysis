PALANPUR: Four persons impersonating as income tax (I-T) officials made off with valuables totaling to Rs 7.89 lakh from a trader in   of Deodar taluka on Sunday. The bag contained jewellery and Rs 41,000 in cash. 

 The four entered the house of trader   (60) and convinced him and his wife Bhanuben that they were from the I-T department. They told Shah to present all the unaccounted cash and valuables he had in the house. 
 
 “The four had even prepared fake identity cards. Surprisingly, they spent nearly an hour-and-a-half at Shah’s house,” said R B Wadhia, police sub-inspector, Deodar police station. “They collected the cash totaling Rs 41,000 and other valuables including jewellery and asked Shah to reach Deodar and get it back,” said Wadhia.
 
 However, when Shah went to see them off, he noticed that the four had come in a   car. He immediately realized that they were not from the I-T department and even raised an alarm. But the four sped away in the car.
 
 The notes were in denominations of Rs 2,000, Rs 500, Rs 100, Rs 50, Rs 20, Rs 10, besides some coins. 
 
 Neeraj Badgujar, Banaskantha superintendent of police, said, “It seems that all four were familiar with the trader’s family as they were addressing them by names. We are trying to trace them with the help of footages from the CCTVs installed at the milk collection centre of Banas Dairy located near Shah’s house,” he said.
