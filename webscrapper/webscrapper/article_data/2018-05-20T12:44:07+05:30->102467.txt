 CHANDIGARH:   on Saturday organised a special interactive session with Shruti Arora, a Panchkula-based resident, who just cleared her UPSC exam. Keshni Anand Arora, additional chief secretary of revenue and disaster management department, Haryana, was the chief guest at the event.
 
 At the session, Shruti shared her plan of action and strategies that made her clear the exam. Stating that it was her third attempt, she said, “The first failure was a must in my life. It made me focus more.”
 
 “I have been successful because there was a lot of motivation from my parents,” she said. “It is important for parents to motivate their children and not compare them with others. Every child is gifted. Imposing wishes and expectations kill their aspirations,” she added.
 
 Clearing the doubts of the UPSC aspirants present at the session, she said, “You must study all your graduation subject in depth.”
