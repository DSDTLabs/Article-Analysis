KOCHI: A paper published in Proceeding of   ( ) on Tuesday said that there could be a 45% decrease in Indian summer monsoon in the late stages of 21st century. 

 Researchers from the centre for prototype climate modeling, New York University, Abu Dhabi - who led the study - ran a climate prediction model that projected changes in monsoon activity. It said that low-pressure systems (LPS), which trigger monsoon, are likely to decrease in the last part of this century.
 
 Previous studies suggested that LPS decreased from the middle of the 20th century. "It is unclear how LPS activity will change with future (global) warming," said R S  , lead author of the study. The team used monthly sea surface temperatures to model past and future LPS activity in India. "We used a high-resolution atmospheric model. LPS activity was simulated from 1981 to 2005 and 2071 to 2095," he said.
 
 In a 'business-as-usual emission scenario', the authors found that Indian monsoon LPS activity declined by 45% in the late stages of 21st century. According to authors of the study, the findings might have implications on hydrological cycle in the region. This scientific climate model showed the changes in monsoon in India and predicted extreme weather events in  , especially the agri belt.
 
 LPS are usually found in the   region, both on ocean and land. About 12-14 such systems are formed in 120 days of monsoon in India and each LPS lasts for three to five days. The study said that there could be 60% fall in ocean and 10% increase in land in this case. The average of the two instances points to a total loss of 45% decline in monsoon intensity and an increase in extreme rainfall events.
 
 Central and northern India are some of the most intensively irrigated regions worldwide and have water resources that are already stressed. A shift in monsoon activity that dries central India and increases the likelihood of extreme rainfall in northern India would have major impact, the study said.
