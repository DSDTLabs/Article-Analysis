LUCKNOW: A group of   law students gheroed vice-chancellor SP Singh, registrar   and proctor   late on Friday. The officials were returning after attending an inter-collegiate cultural and sports fest organized in the girls' hostels on the second campus. 

 The students, annoyed with the continued absence of additional proctor and other officials from the second campus, complained to the proctor and registrar about the irregularities and laxity of the second campus administration. 
 
 "Students have pooled in money to get the sports ground cleaned and the condition of the hostels is also poor. As there is no one to hear our grievance on the second campus, we have to gherao the officials," said LU student  . 
 
 "The students have been called on Saturday to come and meet the vice-chancellor. They have also been asked to give their memorandum of demands so that the university can resolve them," said registrar RK Singh.
