Keri: A blaze allegedly caused by lit, discarded beedis on Thursday affected forested areas along hill slopes at Morlegad in the Sattari taluka, burning not only seasonal wild grasses but also a large number of trees, a majority of which were acacia. Forest department staff were able to put out the fire in some areas. 

 Keri range forest officer (RFO) Girish Bailudkar, said forest department personnel did their best to prevent the blaze from spreading further up the slopes and into inaccessible forested patches. “ I have, however, asked for additional staff to help if any more fires are reported,” he said. 
 
 Morlegad, which comprises reserved forests and privately owned areas, is an ideal habitat for peacocks and a host of other flora and fauna. It has, however, been witnessing substantial deforestation activity in certain parts. 
 
 Around a decade ago, the operation of stone quarries had also posed a threat to the ecologically rich area.
