LUCKNOW: The 11-year-old girl under scanner in   student attack case and her parents have demanded a   or CB-CID probe in the case, while alleging that she was being framed by police and school authorities to save the 'real culprit'. 

 The class VI student came out to interact with media, for the first-time since the incident, on Sunday, a day after TOI, in an exclusive story, published her version of the incident. 
 
 The girl and her father interacted with mediapersons at their lawyer's chamber and demanded a CBI or CB-CID probe into the case. "I want a fair probe into the whole incident not only because I am being framed but also because I want justice for the injured boy," she said. She also demanded a face-to-face interaction with the boy.
 
 The girl's father alleged that police seems to be working with school authorities, and hence he believes that only a CBI or CB-CID probe can do justice. The girl and her father alleged that she was being framed to protect the real culprit. 
 
 The girl's counsel,  , said that there is no concrete against her. "We will approach high court against police action," he said. 
 
 He also asked why school authorities informed the police a day after the incident.
