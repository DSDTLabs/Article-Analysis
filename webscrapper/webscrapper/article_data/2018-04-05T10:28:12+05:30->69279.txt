KOLKATA: People of West   must ensure that flare-ups like those in Asansol and Raniganj do not happen again by putting up resistance laced with principles of peace and brotherhood against all provocations and instigation, a congregation of   from various spheres of arts and academics appealed on Wednesday evening.

 The   discussion on propagating unity and defeating the politics of divisiveness came after communal clashes in Asansol and Raniganj in the aftermath of Ram Navami celebrations on March 25. 
 
 Poet   urged everybody not to react to provocation and instigation from any quarter. “Every religion talks about peace and brotherhood. Whatever happened in Asansol and Raniganj is very painful. Like any citizen of Bengal, I too want to live peacefully,”   said. 
 
 Writer   said there was a reason why divisive forces were succeeding in some cases. “India has a centuries-old legacy of several communities living together in peace and harmony. The elders are failing in imparting this lesson to the younger generations,” Rahman said.
 
 Poet-writer Subodh Sarkar said none of the intellectuals represented any political outfit. “Fellow humans have lost their lives and it is painful to all of us. Let us not pursue the path of hatred, and forge social alliances so that nobody can divide us on caste and community lines,” he said. 
 
 Writer   said: “To reach the top and rule, a person has to work very hard. But in India, it only requires to turn Hindus and Muslims against each other.”
 
 Painter Suvaprasanna said the Ram Navami his mother celebrated signified peace and unity. “Giving weapons in the hands of young children is not the way to celebrate a festival,” he said.
