On Friday, theatre societies of four DU colleges were asked not to perform their plays at  , the annual street festival of  . The reason given to them was that the content of their plays was 'not conducive to the current environment' in the campus. 

  The plays that were not allowed to be staged were Sri Guru  's Sawaal Toh Uthega, Gargi's Main Kashmir Aur Aap? Main Manipur, the play of   (Evening) Jokistaan and  's The Trump Card.
 
  After the general preliminary round, Shunya, the dramatics society of Ramjas College, had selected seven plays which were scheduled to perform yesterday. But a day before the event, the college's authorities asked the students not to go ahead with the plays as they dealt with the topic of nationalism. A source close to the event told us, "The society had selected seven teams, but the college authorities told four groups not to perform and said, 'Kal pakka danga hoga inki wajah se. Toh aisa kuch mat karo jisse unrest ho.' They also read the synopsis of all the seven plays and then told the society members not to include the four teams."
 
  Since they were not allowed to perform, the students of these colleges used their time slot for a silent protest instead, and they sat among the audience with duct tapes over their mouths.
 
  This move comes in the wake of DU witnessing weeks of violent clashes between student wings of political parties after   student  , who is facing sedition charges, was invited to speak at Ramjas in February.
