James Cameron still thinks ' ' is 'a step backwards' for women in films.

  
  
 The 'Avatar' director received heavy backlash from fans, following a controversy in August when he called the film's lead Gal Gadot 'an objectified icon.'
 
  "She's an objectified icon, and it's just male   doing the same old thing! I'm not saying I didn't like the movie, but, to me, it's a step backwards," Cameron said. After a month, it appears the legendary director is still sticking to what he said.
 
  In an interview, 'The Terminator' director responded, "Yes, I'll stand by that. I mean, [Gal Gadot] was Miss Israel, and she was wearing a kind of bustier costume that was very form-fitting. She's absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. To me, that's not breaking ground."
 
  Cameron added, "They had Raquel Welch doing stuff like that in the '60s. It was all in a context of talking about why (Terminator character) Sarah Connor - (played by   created in 1991 - was, if not ahead of its time, at least a breakthrough in its time. I don't think it was really ahead of its time because we're still not (giving women these types of roles)."
 
  'Wonder Woman' director   later hit back at Cameron by defending Gadot's portrayal, saying that not every female character has to look "hard, troubled and tough to be strong." Cameron further responded by telling the publication that Hamilton was never 'treated as a sex object.'
 
  "As much as I applaud Patty [Jenkins] directing the film and Hollywood, uh, 'letting' a woman direct a major action franchise, I didn't think there was anything groundbreaking in Wonder Woman . but I will add a little detail to it, which is: I like the fact that, sexually, [Wonder Woman] had the upper hand with the male character, which I thought was fun," he stated.
