NEW DELHI: Nothing good ever seems to come from
  - even when it's trying to do fix the situation.

 
 That was demonstrated on Tuesday, when three students in a California school were injured after a teacher - one who's a reserve police officer - attempting to show   fired his loaded   in the classroom, reported NBC news. The students were injured from falling debris and possibly from bullet fragments.
 
 Teachers are not permitted to possess firearms in California schools. The incident at Seaside High School occurred just a day before thousands of students across the 
  to demand stricter gun laws. It also occurred a month after 17 people were killed in yet another  , in Florida.
 
 A parent of an injured 17-year-old student at Seaside High School told NBC that the teacher had told the class he was going to use the gun for a demonstration on how to disarm someone. As he began, he checked to see if the weapon was loaded and that's when he accidentally fired it.
 
 Lucky for the students, the semiautomatic was pointed toward the classroom ceiling when it went off, reported CNN.
 
 "It could have been very bad...It's the craziest thing," said the injured 17-year-old's parent.
 
 A picture obtained by NBC showed the 17-year-old with red bruising to his neck, which his parent said appeared to be caused by a bullet fragment.
 
  
  
 
 The school put the California teacher, Dennis Alexander, who's a reserve officer with the Sand City Police Department, on administrative leave. As did the Sand City police. 
 
 "I have concerns about why he was displaying a loaded firearm in a classroom. We will be looking into that," said Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante, to a local TV station.
