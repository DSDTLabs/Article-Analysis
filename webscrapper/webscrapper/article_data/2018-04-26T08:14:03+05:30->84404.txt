JAIPUR:   president   has begun interacting with the party’s grassroots workers through “Shakti”, a mobile based interaction programme launched as a pilot project in Rajasthan last month.

 The party president has interacted, via phone, with several Congress workers, including Gatui aka Geeta Devi (34) from Mudasail booth of Ghatol constituency in Banswara, Jameel (30) from   booth of Kaman constituency in Bharatpur and   (23) from 5-Kd-A booth of Anoopgarh constituency in Sriganganagar.
 
 Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president   told TOI, “It is happening only in the Congress that the party’s national president is talking directly to the grassroots workers, taking their feedbacks and knowing their views, without involving any intermediaries. Such direct communications have never taken place in other political parties.” He added, “Congress is truly a party of the common man.”
 
 Over two lakh party workers from all over the state are said to have been linked with project ‘Shakti’, which is aimed at knowing the ideas and views of Congress workers and gathering feedback directly from the grassroots level.
 
 Pilot said people believing in Congress ideology were coming forward to join this interactive platform. He said that to rope in more people at the booth level, enrolment under the project would continue.
 
 The PCC chief said it was part of a democratic process under which the Congress workers were interacting with party’s top leadership. The workers can put forward their suggestions and also get directions from the party leadership on Congress’s policies and programmes, he said.
 
 Pilot has asked Congressmen going for the party’s ‘Jan Aakrosh Rally’ to be held at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi on April 29 to carry their voter identity cards so that they can be enrolled for the project.
