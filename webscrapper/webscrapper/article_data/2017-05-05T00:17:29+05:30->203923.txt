MUMBAI: The students of   (TISS) have demanded that the   issued to 18 teachers on March 24 be withdrawn and a   be held between all stakeholders to create a sense of trust and respect.

 All teachers, except one, have been reinstated, but their orders have not yet been withdrawn. The students’ union has alleged that the purpose, guidelines and outcome of the committee to review the performance of teachers—on the basis of which one teacher was removed in April—has not been shared with anyone.
 
 The director of the institute, S Parasuraman, was unavailable for comment. 
 
 The students claimed that the teacher, who was removed for ‘poor performance’ as cited by the TISS administration, had not been given any classes or students to guide in the 2016-17. “On the other hand, he had participated, along with students, in several fact-findings and engaged with political issues on and off campus…In presence of such evidence, it raises serious questions about the review process, on the basis of which he has been terminated,” said a statement issued by the union. The teachers from the three UGC-sanctioned centres were issued termination letters as there was no clarity from the   on the extension of these centres.
 
 The students have again raised questions on the corporate-like ‘hire-and-fire’ policies that are increasingly becoming a trend on the campus. TNN
