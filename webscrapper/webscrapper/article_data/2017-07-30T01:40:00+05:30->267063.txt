Ludhiana: Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Dhurman Nimbale on Friday, gave private companies, looking after the repair and maintenance of the   in the city, a stern warning.

 Speaking about the traffic congestion and commuter problems, which result from faulty traffic signals, he said that the companies in charge of the maintenance of the signals should resolve the problem, else face action. MC has allotted tender of maintenance and repair of traffic signals to three private companies, including DIMTS, Sainico and RR Company.
 
 “Faulty traffic signals and non-functioning LED lights cause traffic chaos and even accidents,” he said at a meeting with the officials of the companies. He also added that few crowded traffic signals in the city would be closely monitored given the heavy traffic flow there.
 
 According to police, most traffic problems in the city are caused due to malfunctioning of the traffic signals. He added that timings of most of the traffic signals are not appropriate, with some developing technical glitches. He also said that accidents are caused due to poor functioning of the LED lights at traffic signals.
 
 “The LEDs are not in proper condition, thus making it difficult for the commuters to see it from a distance. Due to these problems, road mishaps are taking place and people are losing lives,” he said.
 
 The DCP has also come up with a way to solve city’s traffic woes. According to him, installation of sensors at signals will help resolve such situations to a larger extent.
 
 “We have asked the company officials to install sensors at traffic signals from Bharat Nagar Chowk to Ferozepur Road Octroi post, Jalandhar Bypass to local bus stand, Old Session Court Chowk to bus stand and Dholewal and Old Session Court Chowk to Rajpura Chowk to smoothen the flow of traffic,” said the DCP.
 
 The DCP also said that the traffic police officials try to maintain traffic manually, but it is not the solution.
