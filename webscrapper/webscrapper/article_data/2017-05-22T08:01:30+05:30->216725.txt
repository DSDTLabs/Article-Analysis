GUWAHATI: As the   gears up for completion of one year in office, peasant organization   (KMSS) has accused the   of being able to accomplish only 11.47% of the 61 major promises made by the   during the assembly election. 

 "Of the 61 major promises, works have only started for seven promises only. So, even the 11.47% does not reflect the full completion of the seven promises," KMSS chief Akhil Gogoi said on Sunday. 
 
 Gogoi alleged that even on the front of fighting corruption, the state government has left out the ministers and MLAs against whom there are charges of misappropriation. "By arresting some officials, BJP wanted to project that its government has launched a crusade against corruption. Unless the big fishes are booked, it is not going to help," Gogoi charged.
 
 Gogoi also charged the state government of going slow on updating the national register of citizens (NRC) despite BJP coming to power on the promise of making the state free of foreigners. "The draft NRC should have been ready by March 31. But it did not happen. On the other hand, NRC update process is facing fund shortage," Gogoi alleged. The KMSS chief also accused the state government's eviction drive against encroachers from government land of being politically motivated.
 
 BJP spokesperson Pramod Swami said, "In a year, the BJP-led government has taken proactive and bold steps in fighting corruption and clearing government lands from encroachers. We don't want to say much on Akhil Gogoi's charges. But we want to ask him why he is silent on 15 years of   rule."
