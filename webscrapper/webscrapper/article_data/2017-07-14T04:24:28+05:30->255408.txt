Mumbai: The income-tax ( ) investigation wing has busted a   racket involving a city   trader. An initial probe suggests that the trader illegally took Rs 400 crore out of country by over-invoicing the value of imports.

 The I-T department in the past few days had conducted   at offices and residential premises of companies associated with the Ashar Group, including Bait Al Tamur in Mumbai and three other cities. They found Rs 10 lakh cash and four bank lockers belonging to the companies. Officials are examining the lockers and recovered documents.
 
 It is believed that the company sent the hawala money to West Asian countries. The officials are probing the further use of hawala money.
 
 Rajesh Ashar, from the Bait Al Tamur office at Navi Mumbai, denied any wrongdoing. He told TOI, “We are not involved in any illegal transaction. We are importing dates like many others in the market. We gave our statement to I-T officials and no such allegation cropped up during the statement. No money was recovered from us.”
 
 Sources said the company sent the hawala money abroad over a period of time and I-T officials are examining the company’s imports of the last two years. It is stated that the company is one of the biggest importers of dates in the country. Officials recorded statements of those associated with the running of the companies after an initial probe revealed they sent out unaccounted money after inflating the value of dates.
 
 The real value of the imports is paid to the supplier abroad and the balance was diverted, sources said. They are also examining if the companies are into smuggling dates.
 
 Generally, companies involved in hawala transactions send unaccounted money abroad through companies that exist only on paper. The companies based aboard will pay the real cost of imports to the supplier and the balance is diverted. They use this money for business deals and sometimes bring it back in the country after manipulating export documents.
