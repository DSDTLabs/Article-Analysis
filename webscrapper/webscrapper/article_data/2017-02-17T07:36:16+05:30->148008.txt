KOCHI: Advertisement boards on roadsides showing intimate scenes or   might attract viewers. But the ‘obscene’ pictures on advertisement hoardings often take a toll on drivers due to their potential to distract.

 Citing an incident occurred at   near Aluva on January 29, motor vehicles department (MVD) officials submitted a proposal before the district road safety council demanding to remove the ‘obscene’ advertisement boards along the national highways. 
 
 The proposal said criminal cases should be initiated against those who erect such ‘obscene’ advertisement hoardings. 
 
 The district road safety council will place the proposal in its agenda to take up at the meeting on Friday. 
 
 Ernakulam RTO P H   said “Advertisements affecting road safety should be removed. But a decision on it will be taken only after conducting inspections on  ,”
 
 A tipper truck knocked down a scooter and run over a housewife, who died on the spot, near Pulinchode. Her husband was injured seriously in the accident.
 
 The police have registered a case and concluded that the accident occurred due to the careless driving of the truck driver.
 
 MVD officials said that an advertisement board, carrying the picture of an enticing woman, might have distracted the attention of the truck driver, since it was erected nearly 12-m away from the accident spot.
