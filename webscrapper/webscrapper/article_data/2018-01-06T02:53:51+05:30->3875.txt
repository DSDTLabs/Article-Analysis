MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( ) Act court on Friday convicted and sentenced a 38-year-old father of one to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for repeatedly raping a minor from 2011 to 2015 after promising to marry her. The child was 13 years old in 2011 when she was sexually assaulted for the first time by the man who lived in her neighbourhood. 

 There was drama in the court after the conviction was pronounced as his family broke down and his minor daughter pleaded with the court for leniency. The court reprimanded the family and said the atmosphere was not conducive for the child.
 
 The victim was 18 years old when she deposed before the court in September 2016. She said that in 2011, the accused told her he loved her and wanted to marry her. He took her to his friend's house, raped her and threatened to kill her if she revealed the incident to anyone. She said this continued and it was only in 2013 that she got to know the accused was married. The victim said when she asked him about it, he told her that he would marry her too. She said that in 2013 and 2014, the accused took her to a lodge in   and raped her. The woman said that on one occasion when she missed her monthly menstrual cycle, he gave her some pills. 
 
  In 2015 after such instances continued, she finally asked the man when he would marry her. She said that the accused did not answer her properly and would beat her up. When she sustained an injury on her hand, she finally told her mother about her ordeal. The mother lodged a complaint with the RAK Marg police on February 18, 2015.
