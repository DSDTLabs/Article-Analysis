Kamya Panjabi, who is currently seen as Preeto in   - Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki, is not the one to shy away from expressing herself. Taking to her Instagram account, the actress posted a bare back picture of herself to support producer  's Lipstick Rebellion for her upcoming film  . 

 Kamya wrote along with the picture: They Said that don’t be that woman …The that other woman..the divorced woman .. the single mother woman .. But I am that woman ..Every time I put in my lipstick on, I smile. because I am being true to myself . Whether the world agrees or not I have made my own don’t.. Don’t you.
 
 
  
 Even though Kamya removed the snap later, there is no doubt that she certainly made quite a bold move with it. The actress has always managed to court controversy - be it with her divorce from actor Bunty Negi or raising her daughter independently. 
  
 On Pratyusha's death anniversary, despite hurdles, Kamya released a short film, Hum Kuch Keh Na Sakey, which narrated the life of late television actor Pratyusha Banerjee and her relationship with boyfriend  .
 
 
  
 Recently, Kamya won Best Actor award in a negative role for her television show Shakti – Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki. The actor shared some pictures from the award show and wrote, “A big thank you to each one of you who voted for me n a very special thanks to very special someone Manveer Gurjar.”
