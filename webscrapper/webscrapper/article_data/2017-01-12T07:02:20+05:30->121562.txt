BENGALURU: Eighty-year-old Clifford Wilson would get irritated whenever strangers parked vehicles outside his residence in Akkayya Layout, Banasawadi, east Bengaluru. A retired government employee residing with his son  , who is 56 years old, Clifford was known as 'military uncle' in the vicinity.

 But a scuffle over parking issue proved costly for Clifford, his son and his daughter-in-law Lynn Wilson, 54, as Banasawadi police on Wednesday arrested them for allegedly attacking a man on the night of December 26.
 
 A distraught Clifford, who was summoned to the police station and arrested, complained of chest pain and had to be admitted to a nearby hospital. “Doctors said the veteran is in shock. He is stable," police said. The trio was later released on bail.
 
 Police said they took up a suo motu case after receiving a video showing the trio beating Jerry, 25, from Mizoram, over parking his vehicle. Jerry works as helper in a men's salon and resides in the opposite lane of Wilson's. “He would regularly park his bike outside the accused's house and the latter would oppose it,“ police said.
 
 During weekends, the Wilsons and other neighbours would have heated exchanges with Jerry and his roommates for hosting late night parties and playing loud music, police added. Jerry was parking his motorbike in front of Wilson's house on December 26 night when things turned nastier.“Pinto objected to it. Jerry, who on normal days would ignore Clifford, decided to hit back. According to the family of the accused, Jerry abused the 80-year-old man. Hearing the shouting, Carlton and Lynn came out and thrashed Jerry ,“ police said.
 
 However, Clifford intervened and stopped his son and daughter-in-law but not before pushing Jerry away .A neighbour, meanwhile, made a video of the assault and sent it to police authorities.
 
 “After watching the video, we registered a case and arrested the accused,” police sources said.
