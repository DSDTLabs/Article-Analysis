NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has asked   and   to explain why they have not complied with its earlier order to appoint an “ombudsman”.

 HC sought a response on a contempt plea against   and   for allegedly sitting on the court’s order, which was meant to allow students to have a forum to redress their grievances.
 
 Justice V Kameswar Rao issued notices to the UGC and DU seeking their replies on the plea and listed the matter for hearing on May 14 when it will take stock of progress made in implementation of its order. The order came last year where it had directed UGC to set up a system to redress the grievances of students in all universities including DU, within four months.
 
 It had also ordered DU to “take necessary steps forthwith and appoint the ombudsman” expeditiously in terms of provisions of the UGC (Grievance Redressal) Regulations of 2012.
 
 The petitioner then filed a plea for contempt alleging deliberate and willful non-compliance of the court's February 3, 2017 order, which had said that the failure of universities to appoint an ombudsman or constitute a Grievance Redressal Committees (GRC) for colleges would defeat the very object of the grievance redressal mechanism provided under the regulations.
 
 “Over the time, GRC constituted by the varsity (DU) is merely a dead paper body in the absence of the office of ombudsman and due to willful disobedience by the contemnors. Due to non-functioning of the Grievance Redressal Regulations, 2012, students of the varsity are compelled to take remedy from this court by filing writ petitions for their genuine grievances,” the contempt plea claimed.
