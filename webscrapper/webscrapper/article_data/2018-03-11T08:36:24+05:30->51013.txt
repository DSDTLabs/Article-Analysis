CHENNAI:   has sought Rs 5,042 crore inter-GST dues from the Centre, said fisheries minister   on Saturday after attending the   council meeting in New Delhi.

 Tamil Nadu has so far received Rs14,305.08 crore under the state GST since the new tax regime was introduced in July last year. Of the IGST, Tamil Nadu has so far received only Rs1,304 crore out of Rs6,346.94 crore due to it. “The state has so far received Rs632 crore as compensation from the Centre for the revenue loss suffered during the initial months of the GST regime. But now we are getting more revenue from GST than what we earned through VAT. We had apprehensions that being a manufacturing state, we may suffer losses after the introduction of GST,” said Jayakumar.
 
 
 Jayakumar said the state was ready for introducing the e-way bill under GST. “This is a new system for trucks going from one state to another. The e-way bill scheme is ready for implementation in Tamil Nadu. We wanted to roll it out on February 1but there was some problem in the GST website and due to that we had to delay the e-way bill scheme,” the minister said.
 
 Under the GST regime, eway bills need to be generated and carried for movement of all goods valued at over Rs50,000. “E-Way bill is an electronic way bill for movement of goods which can be generated on the e-way bill portal. Transport of goods of more than Rs50,000 in value in a vehicle cannot be made by a registered person without an e-way bill,” said a senior commercial tax official.
 
 When an e-way bill is generated, a unique e-way bill number (EBN) is allocated and is made available to the supplier, recipient, and the transporter, enabling tracking movement of vehicles from one place to another.
 
 The GST council also discussed making it easy for GST assessees to file their returns. “The council discussed setting up of a technical grievance cell to help the assessees clear their doubts,” he said.
