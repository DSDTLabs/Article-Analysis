Ludhiana: A major fire broke out on the third floor of Atam Jain Knitwear factory in Nanak Nagar on Friday night. Although there were no casualties, the fire brigade had a tough time negotiating narrow lanes to reach the site. Besides, firemen also contended with problems of a single entrance to the factory and absence of a hydraulic ladder. 

 After receiving a call at around 9.50pm, the fire control room sent six fire tenders from all fire stations to the spot. These were parked outside on the main road and one was taken inside. The remaining fire tenders supplied water to it. Initially, firemen tried to douse the flames from outside. But when they saw this was not working, they entered the building to douse the flames. 
 
 Sub-fire officer Srishti Nath said the owner told them the factory had been closed at around 9.30pm and fire broke out in the next 20 minutes. At the moment, he said, he was not sure about the cause or quantum of loss. 
 
 A fire official said fire brigade vehicles could not enter the narrow and congested lane. He also pointed out that the sole small fire tender that can be used in such conditions is almost 18 years old. He said they need small fire tenders because most of the localities where industrial units are located have congested lanes. 
 
 Box: No fire NoC and fire arrangements 
 
 SFO Srishti Nath said the factory did not have adequate fire arrangements and no objection certificate (NoC) from the fire brigade department. He said even water was not available in the factory and they had to refill fire tenders from the MC tubewell near Chand Cinema at a distance of 1km from the factory site. Had there been arrangement for water inside or near the factory, it might have saved their time, he said.
