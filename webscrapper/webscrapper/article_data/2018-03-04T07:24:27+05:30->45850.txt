KOLKATA: A leading conservation architect and former member of Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s heritage committee on Saturday said he has not seen any Heritage Act in the world that allows buildings that have been declared heritage to be torn down.

 
 Members of   (KAF) also met on Saturday and resolved to find out how and why the Old Kenilworth Hotel’s heritage grade was changed, paving the way for its demolition.
 
 
 Speaking on the downgrading of the heritage   a year ago from Grade II A, that requires a building’s exterior to be maintained as it is, to Grade III, conservation architect   said it is baffling why the committee headed by late historian   created the latter, where a plaque depicting the history of the structure is all that is required.
 
 
 “Listing a building as Grade III is as good as delisting it. It is an invitation to  . It should be done away with at the earliest. Several buildings that were adjudged to be heritage and worth preservation have been lost due to the change in grade,” he said.
 
 
 He also felt the gradation process needed public scrutiny and must not be based on the “whims and fancies” of the hand-picked members of a panel.
 
 
 Sources said the controversial Grade III was probably provided to put in stone the history of a building that was crumbling and beyond salvage rather than to pull down sturdy structures for commercial gain.
 
 
 “KAF is distressed at the destruction of Old  , a building with historical and architectural significance to Kolkata. More than the destruction, KAF is surprised and shocked at the process that led to the destruction of this property. It is surprised that this heritage structure was delisted in opaque circumstances in 2017, which paved the way for the subsequent destruction of the property,” a KAF statement read.
