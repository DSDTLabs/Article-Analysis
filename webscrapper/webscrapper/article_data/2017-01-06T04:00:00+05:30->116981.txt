Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India ( ) has said that numbers that it had released in the past on value of demonetised currency deposited with banks could be incorrect due to possible   errors and double-counts. The central bank has said that it is in the process of reconciling numbers to eliminate errors, and that estimates doing the rounds are likely to be wrong.

 The RBI’s statement comes a day after Bloomberg reported that Rs 14.97 lakh crore worth demonetised currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 have been deposited with banks. “Figures of demonetised notes deposited, released by the central bank in the past, were based on aggregation of accounting entries done at currency chests all over the country. These figures would need to be reconciled with the physical cash balances to eliminate accounting errors and possible double-counts,” said the central bank in a statement released here on Thursday.
 
 The RBI has already initiated this process and says that till this is completed, any estimate may not indicate the actual numbers of the specified bank notes (SBNs) that have been returned. The central bank is taking all steps to complete the process expeditiously so as to release firm figures of SBNs received at an early date, it added.
 
 This is the first time that the RBI is acknowledging the possibility of double-counting in demonetised currency numbers. The issue of double-counting was first raised by the State Bank of India (SBI). “We are not releasing our numbers because we believe that there is a possibility of double-counting. Post offices and cooperative banks have accounts with us and we also started receiving new notes as deposits,” Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman, SBI, had said after the bank discontinued releasing demonetisation-related numbers in mid-December. The research wing of SBI had also come out with a report on the possibility of double-counting of 10-15% in bank deposits.
