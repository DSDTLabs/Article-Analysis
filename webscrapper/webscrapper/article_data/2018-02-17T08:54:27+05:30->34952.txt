CHANDIGARH: Residents who come for buying goods of daily need from market and park their vehicles in city paid parking areas should be exempted from paying fee for the first half-an-hour. Federation of Sectors' Welfare Association of Chandigarh (FOSWAC) will submit a memorandum in this regard to the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC). 

 As of now, MC is charging Rs 10 for parking in commercial area. Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) had proposed that if a resident is leaving behind his vehicle only for half-an-hour, he should be exempted from the parking fee. The issue will be discussed in the meeting scheduled on February 18 in which all RWA's will be present. 
 
 R C Nayyar, member of one of the RWAs, proposed in the meeting that the residents who come to market should be allowed half-an-hour of free parking. Majority of the members agreed to the proposal and suggested to draft a memorandum for it. President of the RWA, Secvtor 19, R L   said there are many public places where similar norms are adopted example being airports.
 
 Vice-chairman of FOSWAC   said various RWAs supported the proposal and decided that it would be sent to the higher authorities for a final nod before they decide the final parking fee which will be imposed from the month of April.
 
 Chairman of FOSWAC   said the association is going to give the suggestion to the authorities for implementation while making recommendation for congestion tax. He said the authorities should name it as entry fee instead of parking fee as no facilities have been added on the parking front.
