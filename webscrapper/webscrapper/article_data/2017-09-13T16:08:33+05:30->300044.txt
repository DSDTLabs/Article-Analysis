CHHAPRA: Addressing the newly-recruited constables during the passing out parade organized at the   ground here on Tuesday, IG (training)   asked them to be vigilant and not to discriminate law breakers on the basis of caste or religion.
 
  “The society is divided into different castes and creed, but for a policeman there is no caste or religion. Every individual is equal before the law and a policeman should not discriminate on the basis of caste and religion,” said the IG. Citing several examples of such incidents during election, the IG said, “Any individual can have personal affiliation for any political party but as policeman on duty we should not support or oppose anyone.”
  
  Altogether, 294 newly-recruited constables from   ( ) and   (Bettiah) districts were given intensive training at Chhapra from January 27, 2016 to September 9, 2017.
  
  On this occasion, the constables presented attractive parade and the chief guest administered oath to them. Some of the trainees, who performed well in the examinations and secured first, second and third positions, were awarded medals by the chief guest and other present. Some of the trainers were awarded mementos for their commendable job during training.
  
    proposed the vote of thanks.
