NEW DELHI:   president   on Saturday slammed chief minister Arvind   for making false   to the people of Delhi.

 Maken said that when at least 82% of the vacancies in Delhi Employment Exchange (DEE) had not been filled up, how could the government give employment to lakhs of people. “Of the 357 posts in DEE, 300 posts are vacant,” he said.
 
 The government’s statistical handbook up to December 31, 2016 states that 12,97,364 people have registered with DEE. “If we include the figures for 2017-18, the total will be around 15 lakh,” Maken said. 
 
 In a reply to a query filed by Delhi Congress RTI Cell, DEE figures show that in 2016, 102 people were given jobs, 66 in 2017 and 46 in April 2018, he added. The figures show that instead of giving employment to eight lakh people, the government has employed only 214 from 2016 till April 2018, Maken claimed.
 
 “In the output-outcome budget 2017-18 of Directorate of Employment, a target to give employment to 5,000 people through job fairs was set. How can a government, which fixes the target of 5,000 jobs a year, provide jobs to lakhs of people,” Maken said. 
 
 Reacting to the comments, a Delhi government spokesperson said, “We have no control over services and recruitment. The power to steer any job appointment in the government lies with the services department, which comes under the lieutenant governor.” He added that the government had been holding job fairs to connect people with the private sector. “Instead of blaming us, Congress should go to the LG and the selection board.”
