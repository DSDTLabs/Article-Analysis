CHANDIGARH: Wild undergrowth, obnoxious weeds around benches, potholes, and garbage heaps have caused the morning and evening walkers of Sector 44-A to avoid using their parks.

 The undergrowth has bred mosquitoes, insects, and poisonous creepy-crawlies. Resident   said: “Why is the municipal corporation blind to these shrubs. We can barely walk without watching out for poisonous insects. The benches have sunk deep into tall grass.” Another resident said: “The children in our neighbourhood have no other playground except the parks. If the grass is not trimmed, we can’t send them out to play, for the fear of insect and mosquito bites.”
 
 Potholes have appeared on the roads. Some of these craters are big enough to unbalance a two-wheeler. The depressions at the turns increase the risk of slipping. Student  , who lives in Sector 44-A: “I drive an Activa (scooter) and these potholes cause me a lot of problems. If I don’t control the speed, there’s every chance of tumbling. I have had a narrow escape. How difficult it could be to re-carpet the road?”
 
 Littered around various buildings of the sector, the kitchen waste mixed with rotten leaves and plastic bags also marks the boundary of the parks. Asked about the garbage collection system, a resident said on the condition of anonymity: “The collector comes to our homes everyday but he empties the segregated dry and the wet waste into the same cart. What is the point of segregation then and what he does with the garbage, we don’t know.”
 
 A lot of residents blamed a woman   Councillor for the MC’s apathetic attitude to the sector.
