It’s the age of radiant nude make-up, however many are under the false notion that it means to go without make-up. On the contrary, it is the perfect way to play up your features without seeming to have used any make-up. Here’s how to work this look gracefully without missing a beat...

 
 
 To help your make-up blend easily, wash your face first with a cleanser, wipe it with a cloth and then gently exfoliate. Apply a foundation that is a shade closer to your natural skin colour and then dust some compact.
 
 First start with defining your eyes. Choose a soft brown eye shadow that is a shade slightly darker than your skin tone to enhance your eyes. Says   professional Nikos Narkissos, “Groom your eyebrows and fill them in sparingly with an eyebrow pencil. Use brown or bronze eyeliner to add definition to your eyes, without making them look heavy. Curl your eyelashes to open up your eyes and add one or two coats of lengthening mascara for finish.” Browns and bronze adds depth to your eyes. 
 
  If you are planning to go completely natural, it is best to add some colour to your cheeks so that you don’t look washed out. Use a matte bronzer that isn’t too orange and apply it to your forehead, bridge of the nose and chin. For your cheeks, use a pale pink blush to lend a healthy glow to your face.
 
  Choose lip colours that correspond with your skin’s undertone and level. For example, opt for shades that are at least as dark as your skin colour. Never go too light, you might end up looking drained-out. If you wish to choose a lip gloss, make sure that it’s a pale nude gloss so that it allows your own lip colour to show through. A transparent orange or peach tone adds slight colour to your face. 
 
 
 
 Keep your lips subtle. Shades of peach or coral works wonders.
 Use a tinted moisturiser all over your face and only conceal where required.
 Use a cream blush for dewier look. Finish it off with light dusting of translucent 
 powder.
