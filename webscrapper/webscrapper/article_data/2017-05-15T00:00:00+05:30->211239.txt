It was last year that   and Cyanide filmmaker AMR   announced his ambitious project Aasphota — The Human Bomb, which revolves around the   assassination. Now, we hear that this film might move beyond being a Kannada-Tamil bilingual and is mostly going to be made in four languages, which means Hindi and Telugu too. And a source close to the project reveals that   will play CBI officer DR Karthikeyan’s character.  , one might recall, headed the Special Investigation Team that probed the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. 
Our source says that the makers and Rana have had a few rounds of discussion already. Rana was also in Bengaluru on Saturday for a meeting, where a consent has been reached. “The formal announcement should be made in a week from now, when the final modalities are worked out,” adds our source.
 Ramesh had previously told us, “I have closely followed the assassination and the developments and have travelled abroad to various places like Sri Lanka, US, Canada, Malaysia and Singapore, where various people from the LTTE added more information to my research. Similarly, I have also been in touch with various police officers who have been involved with the case and they have shared a lot of trivia and inputs in confidence. It is this research, which has spanned over many years, which has led to this script.”
 We also hear that the filmmaker plans on retaining Ravi Kale to essay the role of Sivarasan in this film, since his portrayal of the Rajiv Gandhi assassin was well received in Cyanide.
