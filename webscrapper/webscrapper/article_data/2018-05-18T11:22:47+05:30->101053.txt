CHARMINAR: A man from Medak, who had gone to   in 2013 on a driver visa, is still missing. Relatives have lodged complaints, saying that 39-year-old Mohammed Aweas from   in   district had gone to   on July 2, 2013, but has been unreachable. Aweas’s last call was on July 3, 2013, when he said he landed safely in Jeddah.

 
 His wife and two kids have requested external affairs minister   to take serious note of Awaes’s mysterious disappearance in Saudi Arabia. The family told TOI that   was the only breadwinner and had responsibility of running the family and after his disappearance, the family is facing a tough time.
 
 “We have been waiting anxiously for my husband from last five years. All efforts have gone in vain. We contacted the Kafil, who said that Aweas disappeared leaving behind his baggage in a room. The matter was brought to the notice of deputy chief minister Mohammad Mahmood Ali and we lodged a police complaint against two agents in Hyderabad, but nothing has been done to trace Awaes,” said Shabana Begum, wife of Aweas.
 
 Azher Sultana, Aweas’s sister told TOIthat nobody helped them in this matter, except giving assurances and even agents said that the only option was to meet Sushma Swaraj. “We met some political leaders in Hyderabad, requesting them to help us but nothing has been done so far. We want to know where is Aweas? What happened to him? I sincerely appeal to foreign minister Sushma Swaraj to intervene in this matter and trace my brother is,” said Azher Sultana.
