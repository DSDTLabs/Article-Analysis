THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government will soon complete the procedures to establish   for   people in six districts — Kollam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Kozhikode and Kasaragod — health and   K K Shailaja said in the assembly on Friday.

 “The government has established a transgender cell under the social justice department, besides setting up transgender justice boards at state and districts levels,” she said while replying to a calling attention motion moved by IUML MLA M K Muneer. However, on Muneer’s demand for a legislation based on the transgender policy, the minister said such a legislation was not possible without a central Act.
 
 
 “The government had taken a legal opinion on the possibility of bringing in a legislation for transgender people. The state cannot make legislation on subjects which are not covered by a central Act, the government has been told,” she said.
 
 “The social justice department has been conducting awareness campaigns among teachers to bring down the number of transgender people dropping out of schools, and among police to prevent atrocities against them,” she said.
