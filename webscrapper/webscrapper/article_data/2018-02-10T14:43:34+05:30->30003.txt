 “On an average, we recover around 3 to 3.5 cr every month. After the incident, we had instructed our staff not to spare any defaulter and take best possible action to make them pay their dues,” said Bhaskar Ghosh, an official with discom’s Daly College zone.
 
 Officials also said that they are planning to intensify the recovery drive in all such area where local public representatives and influential persons misbehave with their staff.
