TRICHY:   (closed circuit television) cameras, which have been installed inside three operation theatres at the   government hospital (MGMGH), to monitor operations, has brought to light the discontentment among doctors at the hospital. 

 A section of doctors have submitted a petition to Dr  , dean of the hospital, against recording using cameras. 
 
 “The cameras placed inside the operation theatres are in direct infringement on the privacy of patients. It is illegal to monitor the surgery without the consent of the patient,” states the representation submitted on April 2. 
 
 In the copy of the representation accessed by TOI, it was mentioned that the CCTV cameras have been placed inside main operation theatres (MOT) 1 and 2 and the septic operation theatre (SOT) among the 27 operation theatres in the hospital including trauma and super speciality block inside the campus. 
 
 Head of the department of surgery, Dr T  , installed the CCTV cameras 10 days back and had a screen set up in his chamber to monitor proceedings inside the operation theatre live or through the recording. 
 
 Since then it had caused differences among doctors and the discontentment came out in the open on Monday. The doctors emphasised on the privacy of patients who were left exposed in surgeries such as lithotomy, breast, genitourinary etc. 
 
 In response to the complaint, Dr Karunakaran said that the purpose of keeping a CCTV camera inside the OT was to monitor the surgery. “It is part of the development of medical education. By monitoring the functions inside, we can find out the way the surgeries are done and it will help us teach them in a better way. They need not take it negatively. The cameras have been placed with consent from the authorities,” Dr Karunakaran told TOI. 
 
 The dean maintained that the hospital was cautious in maintaining the privacy of patients. “There is no disagreement between the doctors. The issue is settled,” she said.
