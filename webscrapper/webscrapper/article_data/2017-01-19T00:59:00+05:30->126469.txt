Allahabad: The Allahabad   on Wednesday directed the Centre and the state government to file replies (counter affidavits) showing the action taken to ensure minimum   in 45,791 upper primary schools of Uttar Pradesh as per provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act-2009.

 Hearing a PIL filed by one Kumari Kumkum, a class VIII student of upper primary school in Kasimpur Kheri, Baghpat, and her father Shiv Kumar, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Dilip Babasaheb Bhosale and Justice Yashwant Varma fixed February 15 as the next date of hearing.
 
 Earlier, appearing for the petitioners, their counsel Durga Tiwari argued that the RTE Act makes subject-wise teachers mandatory for class VI to VIII. As per law, a school where more than a 100 students are admitted, there must be a part-time instructor for art, work education and health and physical education. Although in Uttar Pradesh there are 45,791 upper primary schools, only 13,769 posts of teachers for each of the subject had been sanctioned by the state government. Hence, only 13769, schools have subject-wise teachers. 
 
 It was stated in the petition that in the last three academic sessions, the state government has discontinued services of 2,272 part-time instructors of art, 1,601 of health and physical education and 4,019 of work education. This action of the government has only worsened the situation of education in the schools of UP, it was further stated. 
 
 Thus, the petitioners requested the court to direct the Centre and the state government to provide education in upper primary schools of UP as per standards laid down in RTE Act, 2009.
