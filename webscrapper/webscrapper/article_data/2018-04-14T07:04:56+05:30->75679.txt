PATNA: The   on Friday asked the Centre and the state government to submit counter affidavits within a week to clarify why record registers of antiquities kept in 12 museums of   were not being maintained properly.

 Hearing a PIL filed by Vikash Chandra alias Guddu Baba, the bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad expressed annoyance over the callous behaviour of the officials in maintaining the record registers, technically known as accession registers, of the antiquities.
 
 The petitioner had annexed a report of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) published on February 2, 2015, which categorically highlighted the poor maintenance of accession registers in museums across Bihar. The report said altogether 9,570 antiquities were entered in accession register of Patna museum out of which 2,031 had no date of accession, 772 had no date of provenance, 1,213 without any date of donation, 2,496 antiquities had no date of receipt and 7,597 had no information about placement.
 
 The report had also cited fear of theft or loss of precious antiquities due to lack of proper record maintenance. A particular stolen or lost antique could not be traced easily under such circumstances, the report said.
 
 The office of Auditor General of Bihar, in a counter affidavit on Friday, admitted that some of the museums provided copy of accession registers with incomplete information while some museums were yet to submit their records to the AG office.
 
 It also mentioned that the directorate of museum in the state did not have a comprehensive policy for management of antiquities. The matter would come up hearing after four weeks.
