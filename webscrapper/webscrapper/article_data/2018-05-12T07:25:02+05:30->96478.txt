BENGALURU: Many customers who visited banks a day ahead of the polls had to return home empty-handed. Even ATM users were left disappointed as many machines ran out of cash.

 Servers were down at most banks on Friday, except a few in the central business district (CBD). Also, many were understaffed, with employees being deployed on election duty. M Mohan Reddy, convener of the State-Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), told TOI that most staffers of nationalised banks had been roped in for poll work. While this had affected services, things would return to normal Monday onwards, he added.
 
 
 At the Chandra Layout branch of State Bank of India, officials said they weren’t able to carry out transactions as the server was slow. “A few minutes after we started work, it crashed,” an official said. Nagendra S, a customer in Rajarajeshwari Nagar, said, “I visited SBI to transfer money but officials said they couldn’t help me as the server was down.”
 
 In Koramangala, many ATMs ran dry. “I went to the Axis  , only to find it had no cash. Though netbanking and online transactions are of great help, we do need hard cash for our daily needs and medical emergencies. We can’t entirely depend on e-wallets,” said Noopur Dalal, an architect from Koramangala who was hugely inconvenienced.
 
 Syeda Bushra, a student who lives in Marappa Garden, said, “ATMs in my area are either not functioning or don’t have cash. This is problematic for people like me who use public transport daily.”
 
 However, officials at SBI, Canara Bank and Corporation Bank on MG Road said they worked without any hassle. But a few ATMs on MG Road and Brigade Road ran dry.
