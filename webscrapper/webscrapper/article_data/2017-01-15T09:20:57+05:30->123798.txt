BIJNOR: Police here on Friday   and alleged   who had been on the run with a   in his name in connection with a 10-year-old case.
 
  According to police officials, a   (STF) team had arrested two persons including Ali, resident of Chak Udaychand village under Badapur police station, in Lucknow in 2007 for spying for Pakistan. The STF had also seized an AK-47 rifle, a Chinese pistol and five kg of RDX, detonators and a large amount of ammunition from them. However, a trial court cleared Ali of the charges for want of evidence in January 2015, and Naushad had been released.
  
  The state government had immediately appealed against the decision in the Allahabad high court and proceedings were going on. The high court issued notices to Ali several times for not appearing at the hearings, but he did not turn up. The high court then issued non-bailable warrant against him and directed Bijnor police to arrest him by January 16 this year. After receiving the order, police raided several places late on Friday night and arrested him from Badapur.
  
  “Following the high court’s order, we formed a team to locate and arrest Ali. We finally tracked him down to a madrassa in Badapur where he had been living. We are probing the matter thoroughly. His mobile call details are also being examined. We are trying to find out who he used to call and who he was in contact with. We are still interrogating him,” said Ajay Sahni, Bijnor superintendent of police.
  
  “Ali will be taken to Lucknow on Saturday night and handed over to Lucknow police,” the SP added.
