KOLKATA: The collaboration between artificial intelligence and humans will have to be meaningfully leveraged to generate jobs in future, felt  , the president of  , London. In Kolkata to deliver a keynote address at a CII meet on Monday, Gast — a researcher, scholar and academic leader — pointed out that from being mere tools to work with, computers will soon have to be turned into collaborators to carry out tasks. 

 Graduates must now be trained for “jobs that don’t exist yet”, she said. “Artificial intelligence and robotics have already started replacing people, particularly in manufacturing jobs. We should now look into new areas where there could be an interaction between the two. For instance, online legal counselling or investment advice.   will have to be seriously explored and university courses should now be designed to meet that challenge. Jobs in future will perhaps be more analytical and collaborative. Computers will be something you won’t just be working with, but collaborating with,” said Gast.
 
 Referring to the   link that has existed for over a century, Gast pointed out that Indian students thrive in London “They are innovators and risk-takers Some have been wrongly saying that they are not welcome post-Brexit. But I would say that they are performing brilliantly,” she said. Indian pass-outs from Imperial College, Gast added, have been brilliant entrepreneurs. “One of them launched a start-up called Urja that advocates the use of bio-fuel to serve as a source of low-cost electricity. Another young Indian developed a cheap baby-incubator. Over 50% of our publications have Indians as collaborators,” she said.
 
 “We want to send a message to Indian students that they should continue to apply to us and other UK universities. Nothing has changed regarding visa laws. In fact, our masters’ degree programme visa norms have now been streamlined. Students can now stay back six months after they have finished their course.”
