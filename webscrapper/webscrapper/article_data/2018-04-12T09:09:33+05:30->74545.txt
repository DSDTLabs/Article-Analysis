ROHTAK: A former station house officer of   was sentenced to a month in jail for not appearing in court. 

  was summoned by the court on five occasions for recording his statement in a case of drug peddling. However, he did not appear even once. 
 
  Kumar got bail after the verdict, and is expected to file an appeal against the jail term.
 
 One Himanshu was arrested in 2016 in a case of drug peddling. The court of additional sessions judge D K Mittal had directed the then   SHO, who is Kumar, to appear before it on May 4, May 15, May 22, July 3 and August 4 in 2017, but the cop did not follow its directions. 
 
 The Bhiwani court had then directed Dadri sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Ankita   to look into matter under Section 174 (non-attendance in obedience to an order from public servant) of the IPC. 
 
 SDJM Sharma had issued a bailable warrant against SHO Vikas to put forth his defence in the matter. When he failed to appear in court even then, the court on Wednesday issued non-bailable warrants against the erring SHO. The court observed that despite being a responsible police officer, he failed to do his duty and pronounced a monthâ€™s jail term for him. He, however, got bail to make an appeal against the court order.
