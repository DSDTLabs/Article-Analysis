KOCHI: To ensure women’s safety, many residents’ associations in the city are approaching the women’s commission and   to conduct self-defence programme for women. 

 For the past 11 months, over 200 self-defence classes were conducted in the city and majority of them were for residents’ associations. This is besides the regular self-defence classes conducted in schools and colleges in the city.
 
 “Many a time, the public themselves request us to hold such classes. We also approach them to offer sessions in and around the city, following which they themselves request for follow-up sessions,” said   SI, who coordinates the programmes across the city.
 
 “Women up to the age of 80 have attended their classes,” said Laughy Daniel, a trainer with the team and a Nirbhaya volunteer. 
 
 “There is no Karate or   involved in the   mechanisms but simple techniques to overpower the attacker as well as to maintain composure during the unanticipated assault. The sessions that we take in schools and colleges include 18 hours of practical classes and two hours of theory,” Daniel said.
 
 Apart from residents’ associations, Kudumbashree units and women’s organizations also request the team for conducting such classes and sessions.
 
 Popular Road Residents’ Association, Vaduthala, which will be holding one such session at   on Sunday, is looking forward for improvising the sessions with the aid of extra trainers from other martial arts spheres like Kalari.
 
 “There are 450 families in the association and many are working women. Such classes are highly helpful for them and thus we have approached the team for holding a   here,” said Sooraj Mohan, joint secretary of the association.
