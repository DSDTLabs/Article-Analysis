Ghaziabad: : A five-member team of the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) of India began a probe into the functioning of Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) on Monday. The team arrived from Lucknow, two days after the   ordered   to allow   officials for the probe.

 According to officials, the CAG will conduct a performance audit of the development agency.
 
 GDA secretary Ravindra Godbole said, “The audit process is expected to go on for two months. Files have been summoned by the team. The files are inspected from Wednesday onwards. Our officials will extend all co-operation to the team for the inspection.”
 
 Last week, a team of CAG officials was turned away from GDA when they had arrived for an audit. There was a tug-of-war between the central government and the UP state government for more than one year about the CAG’s competence to probe the affairs of GDA.
 
 GDA had maintained that it does not fall under the ambit of the CAG because it does not use resources out of the Consolidated Fund of India. The state government had maintained that GDA generates its own resources and is a non-profit body.
