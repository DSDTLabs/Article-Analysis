CHARMINAR: The cap markets of   that took the striking maroon cap with a silk tassel off their shelves a few years ago, are now displaying it again with pride as the takers for the Rumi topi are increasing by the day. Also called the Nawabi topi, the six-inch-long cylindrical cap is known to impart a royal look and add to the personality of those wearing it. 

 Owner of the oldest cap shop in the bustling Madina area near Charminar, Mohammad Ilyas   of Mohammed Cap Mart has been making and selling these caps for the past 115 years. Bukhari recalled how it was the seventh   of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan, who was only five feet tall, who wore this cap first. He did so to look taller, especially when meeting his foreign guests. 
 
 "The tradition of wearing the Rumi topi was introduced after the seventh Nizam visited Rome. Thus, the culture originated from there. After Mir Osman Ali Khan introduced the cap here, his other family members and close associates started wearing it," Bukhari said.
 
 The cap, however, is largely believed to be of Greek origin. The cone (shell) of the cap was imported from Greece, Turkey and   and the finishing was done by local craftsmen in the city.
 
 The craft was on its deathbed in the last 20 years as people opted for other fancy caps. But traders have reported a comeback of the Rumi top, with people once again opting to use it as a status symbol.
 
 "The cap is a symbol associated with royalty and people are using it as part of their dress code during weddings and other special occasions. The business has also improved because we are now making these caps available in different price ranges," Bukhari said.
 
 Each Rumi topi requires 30 minutes to make and the price ranges from 250 to 5,000. The Rumi topi may not be catching on like a craze in the city, but the craft is definitely back into relevance and may make its presence more widely felt, added Bukhari.
