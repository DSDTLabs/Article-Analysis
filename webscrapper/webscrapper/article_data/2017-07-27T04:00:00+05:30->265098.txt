Ahmedabad: What could be more embarrassing for the police than a retired cop being hoodwinked out of Rs 50,000 by a woman in a bank? Raman Chavda, a retired head constable, went to the Vejalpur branch of SBI to withdraw money sent by his son Ashish, who lives in London.

 According to police sources, Chavda, a resident of Bazigar Flats on Anandnagar Road, retired in September 2016. His two sons live abroad. “Chavda went to the bank to withdraw Rs 4.20 lakh, which he got in Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes. However, as Chavda had forgotten to take a bag along, he was given a cloth bag by an unknown man. On getting home, Chavda found he was Rs 50,000 short. He rushed back to the bank and found that the bag he was carrying had a cut in it,” added a police official.
 
 Police sources said that on examining CCTV footage of the bank, it was seen that a woman came near Chavda, made a cut in the bag and made off with the money. “We are hunting for the woman on the basis of the footage,” added a police official.
