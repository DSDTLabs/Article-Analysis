MYSURU:  , an important junction in the city, ground to a halt on Wednesday after advocates formed a human chain around it for nearly five hours. They were protesting against police sub inspector Yellalinga for allegedly assaulting advocate Gokul Govardhan some days ago.

 With negotiations between members of the Mysuru Bar Association and city police continuing to be in a deadlock for the third day, the lawyers moved from the association office to Ramaswamy Circle at 11am and protested till 4pm. Their only demand was the suspension of Yellalinga whereas police are claiming there is no ground to do so.
 
 Bar Association president G V Ramamurthy said, â€œWe will continue our stir till the SI is placed under suspension. The members will meet again at the association on Thursday to decide the future course of action.
 
 Sources claim the police commissioner is thinking of relocating the SI from   till the situation simmers down. An officer said there was no alternative position for the SI. However Association members said even if the SI is relocated to another station or any police unit they will continue the protest till his suspension.
 
 The court campus wore a deserted look as advocates refrained from proceedings for the third day in the week. However, the courts remained open.
