Hyderabad: Medipally police arrested a 35-year-old bank employee, who had strangled her husband on December 31 with the help of her son and hanged the body from the ceiling fan to make it appear like a suicide.

 Police arrested Amruta, an attender at Karnataka Bank’s Buddha Nagar branch in Medipally, and her son Venkatesh, 18, an Intermediate student for murdering Ch Srinivas, a water tanker driver. The family had migrated from Tungaturthi mandal in Suryapet district two years ago. 
 
 Srinivas, an alcoholic, used to harass Amruta, due to which she decided to kill him. On Dec 31, when Srinivas was fast asleep, Amruta and Venkatesh strangled him with a plastic wire and made it look like a suicide. “Three days ago, we received the post-mortem report in which the cause of death was mentioned as strangulation,” Medipally inspector K Jagannath Reddy said.
