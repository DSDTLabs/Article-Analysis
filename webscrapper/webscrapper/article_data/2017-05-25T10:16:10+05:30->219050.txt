TRICHY:   awaiting their class 12 board   need not lose sleep over state board students cornering most of the seats in arts and   after the latter’s results were out two weeks ago. Several city colleges have said that they have kept some seats aside for deserving CBSE candidates. 

 With the state board results published a couple of weeks ago, most city   colleges have already completed their admissions for this year. Many colleges say that they have reserved roughly 10 per cent seats in specific courses for students from the CBSE stream. 
 
 St Joseph’s College (SJC) in Trichy which published the second list of selected candidates on the college website for 2017-18 has asked willing CBSE candidates to approach the college principal with a copy of the marklist. The college invites applications from CBSE candidates every year. Its principal S Andrew said that they reserve at least 10 seats for students from the CBSE schools in specific courses.
 
 “They approach our college to get admitted in some of the much sought-after courses like Commerce, Physics and Chemistry. We do not want to ignore these students who are comparatively brighter than state board students and want them to study in our college,” said the principal adding that such candidates must approach them immediately after their results are out. “We have reservation of seats in management quota as well,” said Andrew.
 
 Paul Dhayabaran, principal of Bishop Heber College (BHC), said they also reserved at least 10 seats for CBSE candidates in some courses. They are considered for admission based on their performance in the board examination. 
 
 There are a total of 23 arts and science colleges in Trichy district. Roughly, 1,000 candidates from 30 CBSE schools in Trichy have appeared for the board examination and are awaiting results.
