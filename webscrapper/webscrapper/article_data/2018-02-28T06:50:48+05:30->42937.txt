KOLKATA: A 16-year-old   was allegedly   near her   twice: first, when the   was on her way to her tuition with her mother on Monday evening and when she was returning with her brother.

 The 2016 state champion complained that a group of men allegedly forced her off a scooter that she was riding with her mother and tried to drag her to a desolate place. Her brother, who was nearby, intervened but he was allegedly assaulted by the group.
 
 “I was taking my daughter to her tuition class when three to four men stopped us near a local club and started harassing her. They tried to drag her away. We were near our home and I screamed out for my son and others. They assaulted him as well before letting my daughter go when neighbours joined us,” claimed the girl’s mother.
 
 The incident took place around 7pm and was reportedly repeated around 10pm, when the girl was riding back home from the class with her brother. “They again tugged at her dupatta and molested her besides beating up my son mercilessly. All this happened in front of a local Trinamool leader who did not stop the accused,” she said.
 
 But the Trinamool leader denied to have been on the spot. “I was not there when the incidents took place. But people from the area said girl’s uncle was throwing bricks and stones at stray dogs, which a group of boys objected to and that led to an altercation. I do not have any information on the girl being molested,” he claimed.
 
 The family initially lodged ageneral diary at the Sonarpur police station and later filed a separate FIR on Tuesday. “We had initially heard it to be a dispute over some dogs being stoned but based on the girl’s allegation of molestation, we are drawing up requisite sections,” said an officer from the South 24 Parganas police division.
