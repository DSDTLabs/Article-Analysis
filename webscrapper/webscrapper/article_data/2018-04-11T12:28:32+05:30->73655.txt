VADODARA: Want to complaint about the illegal parking in your area or wrong side driving on roads? 

 On Wednesday, you can directly voice your traffic related grievances to the Vadodara city traffic police between 4 pm and 6 pm on its social media accounts. The police will address the issues on their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts. 
 
 In an innovative step called PCR Online, the police have decided to reach out to the   to hear and resolving their traffic issues. “Citizens face several problems related to traffic in many areas and they need a platform to post their complaints. So, we decided to communicate with them directly through our social media accounts. It will be like an online town hall interaction,” said Manoj  , city police commissioner.
 
 Citizens can send text messages, photos and videos on the social media accounts of the police. “Our officials will examine the complaints and address them. The steps we took will also be posted on our social media accounts that have a good following now,” Sashidhar told TOI. 
 
 Ahmedabad police had taken a similar initiative for reaching out to the citizens last week. 
 
 Sashidhar said that the police will start a crackdown on traffic offenders from April 14. Those driving on wrong side, without helmets, seatbelts or on the wrong side will be penalized. The network of CCTVs will be used to catch the offenders. “We want to spread awareness among citizens and also resolve their issues before we begin penalizing traffic offenders. We are expecting a good response from the citizens,” Sashidhar said. The city police have recently launched a creative campaign on its social media accounts wherein citizens are being asked to follow traffic rules and also stay away from illegal activities.
