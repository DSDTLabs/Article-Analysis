KOLKATA:   recorded their first IPL win at the   with absolute ease when they beat   by five wickets here on Saturday. The SRH bowlers, backed by some superb fielding, responded well to skipper Kane Wiliamson’s decision to put the rivals in to bat first on winning the toss as they restricted them to 138 for eight.

 
 The SRH skipper then led from the front hitting a 44-ball 50 with the help of four fours and one six, while chasing down the target in 19 overs. For the first time in this  , KKR went in with two India Under-19 players as   and Shivam Mavi made their debuts in the glamourous T20 league. But KKR in a way brought their own downfall as skipper Dinesh Karthik got the batting order all wrong that saw almost all the batsmen struggling to adjust themselves to new positions.
 
 Vice-captain Robin Uthappa, instead of Sunil Narine, walked out with   to the open the innings. But Bhuvneshwar Kumar was right on target and dismissed Uthappa in his second over with a beauty that took the bat’s outer edge and flew into the big gloves of wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha. Lynn tried to take the initiative by smacking 14 runs, including three boundaries, off Siddharth Kaul’s first over.  , promoted to No. 3, hit legspinner Rashid Khan for a huge six and then cut him past point for a boundary in the next over.
 
 Despite that, KKR managed only 49 runs in the Power Play overs — their lowest in this edition of IPL. Just when it looked like Lynn and Rana were in control, a sharp shower stopped play after seven overs with the scoreboard reading 52/1.
