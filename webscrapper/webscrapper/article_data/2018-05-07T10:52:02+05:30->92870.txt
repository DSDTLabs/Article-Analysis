 The   said on Sunday that each dog has been trained for 12 months to be able to detect small traces of explosives. They will be based in airport cargo sheds to screen large volumes of freight as one additional layer of protection.
 
 Aviation minister   says the use of the dogs "will bolster our existing rigorous security methods."
 
 Dogs are already deployed at UK airports, including London's sprawling  , to aid police in identifying criminals and preventing drug transport and other illegal activities.
