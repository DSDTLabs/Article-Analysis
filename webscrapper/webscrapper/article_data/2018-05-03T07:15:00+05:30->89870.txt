MANESAR: There are nearly 4-5 lakh unemployed youths in the state and giving them employment is a big challenge for the state government, chief minister   has said at an event organised by the technical education (Haryana) department at the government polytechnic centre in Manesar.

 Speaking at I-tech on Wednesday, the chief minister said that every year, 2,00,000 students passed out of educational institutes and started looking for jobs. 
 
 “The number of people who get government jobs every year is, however, only around 20,000, which leaves a huge gap. We need the help of the industry to bridge this gap,” he said, addressing industrialists present at the event.
 
 The state government has recently publicised 54,000 government jobs in the state. 
 
 Another 38,000 group D enrolments will also be done, soon. “We heavily rely on technology and entrepreneurship to bring down the unemployment rate. Hence, we invite industries to collaborate with us in imparting skills to the students, so that they can get jobs,” said Khattar. 
 
 The chief minister added that the government would, meanwhile, work towards creating opportunities for training students, as well. 
 
 A special programme called ‘Sahyog Club’ started by the department of technical education aims for the same. The project will rope in the students from polytechnic and civil engineering colleges for revival of water bodies across the state. 
 
 The programme was formally launched by Khattar at the event.
 
 The chief minister said that students would not only clean water bodies under the project but also work with development authorities in maintaining water levels in those. The initiative would not only give the government resources for revival of water bodies but also help several students reconnect with villages.
