PATNA: Famous Hindi play ‘Yugpurush – Mahatma ke Mahatma’ will be enacted at   here on May 23 to mark the 150th birth anniversary of  , a   and philosopher. The nearly two-hour long play will begin at 7.30pm. 

 The play, directed by Rajesh Joshi and written by Uttam Gada, is based on the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and Shrimad Rajchandraji, who was also a spiritual guru to Gandhi and influenced him deeply. 
 
 The play traces the history of Gandhi from a barrister to a Mahatma and effectively pays tribute to both the legends.
 
 “The play has been constructed under the inspiration of Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai, founder and inspiration behind Shrimad Rajchandra Mission, Dharampur,” said Pradeep Jain, president of Jain Sangh, Patna. 
 
 Gandhi met Shrimadji in 1891 in Mumbai upon his return from England. Shrimadji’s spiritual pursuits, enlightening wisdom and moral earnestness left a deep impression on Gandhi. Even when Gandhi left for South Africa, he corresponded with Shrimadji through letters. It was Shrimadji’s insightful thoughts, principles of truth and nonviolence which later moulded the tenets of Gandhism. 
 
 In Modern Review’s June 1930 edition, Gandhi himself wrote about Rajchandraji, “Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man has ever till now.”
 
 The enactment of play in Bihar’s capital holds more significance this year as the state is holding a series of functions in Patna and other parts of north Bihar to mark the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran satyagrah.
