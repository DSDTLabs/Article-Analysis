GUWAHATI: Chief minister   is all set to expand the 11-member ministry of two years in alliance with   (AGP) and Bodo People's Front (BPF) on Thursday. He is also likely to reshuffle the portfolios of the existing ministers to accommodate the new entrants. 

 Sonowal was given the nod to increase the size of the ministry by BJP president Amit Shah on Saturday but he now faces the daunting task of satisfying his own party men as well as the allies. The expansion of the ministry was in the offing for the last 10 months but Sonowal was waiting for Shah's approval, which came on Saturday last.
 
 There are only eight vacant slots and AGP and BPF are demanding two berths each. At present, the two allies have two members each in the ministry while the seven remaining slots are occupied by BJP members.
 
 A source said Sonowal is likely to fill up seven berths, keeping one vacant, and accommodate one member each from the two allies, . While BPF leader Chandan Brahma, a former minister in previous Congress-BPF government, is the most likely to be inducted from BJP's Bodo partner, AGP's old timer and a former minister Phani Bhushan Choudhury's name is doing the rounds. From among BJP members, a former Congressman and known to be Himanta Biswa Sarma's key lieutenant, Pijush Hazarika is seen as a certain inclusion. Another probable minister is former AASU general secretary and BJP MLA Tapan Kumar Gogoi. 
 
 Sonowal is likely to reshuffle the portfolios of some of the present ministers, including that of Pramila Rani Brahma of BPF, who is currently in charge of forest and tribal welfare departments.
