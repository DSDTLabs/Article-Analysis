Surat: Two 14-year-old girls were reportedly abducted from Limbayat area of the city on Wednesday. Parents of the girls, who are cousins, suspect 19-year-old Bhagat’s hand in this. 

 The two cousins went missing on Thursday afternoon. Father of one of the girls registered a complaint of abduction against Bhagat, who is sorcerer, at Limbayat police station. 
 
 “Parents of the girls suspect Bhagat. They say that he claims to treat people with tantra and mantra and may have abducted the two girls with his magical powers. Bhagat’s actual name is Gyaneswar alias Nana Bhaidas Sirsath and he was a regular visitor at one of the girls’ house. We have started investigations in the case and will be going to his house at Sanjay Nagar, Limbayat again. We did not find him at his residence when we went earlier,” a police officer said.
