NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old BTech student,  , was arrested on Tuesday from his residence in Kalkaji for duping banks of around Rs 1 lakh through ATM fraud. 

 While scanning through online videos Rajput came across a post showing a person override system functions of an ATM by placing his finger in between the shutter of the cash dispensing unit. Rajput then used the technique to withdraw small amounts — Rs 5000-10,000 — from ATM machines. He would later approach the bank with a “failed transaction” slip and get the money reimbursed to his account.
 
 An alert security guard of an HDFC ATM, Santosh, found Rajput’s actions suspicious and reported it to the police on Tuesday. Santosh is a member of the “Prahari” scheme launched by   commissioner   to include security guards and chowkidars in community policing. 
 
 A case of cheating was registered based on a complaint by the manager of the HDFC bank at Kalkaji. 
 
 Rajput told police that he had scanned through websites to look for ways to hack into an ATM after a challenge from his friend. While looking for videos, he found a page where the user showed that if one can hold the shutter of the cash dispensing unit of an ATM for sometime, the machine gets disconnected from the satellite server leading to an error. This does not record a transaction in the books of the bank even if the cash is dispensed from the machine.
 
 Romil Baaniya, DCP southeast, said that banks too reimbursed the amount to Rajput’s account as per the procedure within a stipulated time after verification, which did not show a malfunction in the machine. Rajput told officers that he used to withdraw cash from different ATMs using cards of his friends, so that the banks did not get suspicious. Police have recovered some cards belonging to his friends from his house.
