JALANDHAR: The   on Sunday announced Major General Suresh Khajuria (retd) as its party candidate from the   parliament seat. The BJP and the Congress are yet to announce their candidates.

 Khajuria’s candidature was announced by leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann in a joint press conference in Jalandhar. They said they had picked up a local candidate while those being considered by the Congress and the BJP were locals.
 
 Khajuria, 64, originally hailing from Bhungal village near Pathankot, now lives in Panthankot city.
 
 Khaira said the decision to choose Khajuria as the candidate for the parliamentary seat was taken after consultations with the leaders and volunteers in the Majha region as well as the Gurdaspur unit of the party. “We are proud to say that our candidate has a distinguished career in the armed forces and has served the country while candidates of both the traditional parties the BJP and the Congress are likely to be outsiders – from Mumbai and Abohar respectively,” he said.
 
 He said they would run a clean campaign and would spend within the limits prescribed by the Election Commission. Pointing guns at the Congress, Khaira alleged that suicides by farmers had increased in the last six months.
 
 Bhagwant Mann also took a dig at Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh alleging that he had not gone out to meet the people of the state even six times in the last six months.
 
 On the occasion, Khajuria said he had served the Army for 40 years and had been working with the ex-servicemen for the last five years. He said he had joined AAP as a volunteer in 2013.
 
 Meanwhile, the Punjab BJP unit has sent names of late MP Vinod Khanna’s wife Kavita Khanna and senior BJP leader  , to the party high command for final selection. The Congress remains a divided house.
