GUWAHATI: A bio-engineering method to control river erosion developed by   is in a state of disrepair. After successfully implementing a pilot project in the   in Dhemaji district, Hazarika has now appealed to the state government to support the effort. 

 The technology relies on the use of plastic nets tied to concrete blocks fit into the soil near river banks to check erosion, Hazarika, who is also the general secretary of  , said. Following this, they also plant several saplings on it and let them grow. 
 
 The pilot project was carried out in the Dikrong river in Dhemaji district in 2007-10 under a Rs 35-lakh sponsorship of the North   Ltd (NEDFI). The IIT-Guwahati provided them with technical assistance. 
 
 "Around 300 metres of land was used and those areas remained free of any effect of erosion. It was a grand success. It was completed in 2011. The follow-up study has also proved that it has been successful in checking erosion. If it can be implemented in other parts of the state, I am pretty sure we will be able to save more lands from erosion. But we need to have the support of the government to implement the project," Hazarika told TOI. 
 
 He said that after selecting the location hit by erosion, they level the land at 45 degrees. Following this, they plant trees and cover the area with layers of plastic nets. Finally, according to the speed of the water flow, concrete blocks weighing of 80 kg are fixed.
 
 Hazarika and his team participated in the Innovation   Centre, Guwahati, which concluded on Sunday. 
 
 Since the 1950s, Assam has lost an area of 4.27 lakh hectares of land to erosion, amounting to 7.4% percent of the state's total land mass. Around 8,000 hectares of land are lost annually, displacing thousands of families across the state. 
 
 According to Hazarika, this technology can be a huge relief, at least in areas surrounding the tributaries, if not those around the Brahmaputra.
