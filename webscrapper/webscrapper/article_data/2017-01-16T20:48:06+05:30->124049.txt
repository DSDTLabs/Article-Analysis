Allahabad: Members of Samajwadi Party’s district unit welcomed Election Commission of India’s (ECI) decision to allot the party’s symbol to chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and acknowledge him as the party’s national president on Monday. Celebrations erupted at SP’s district office at George Town and the leaders took to streets and distributed sweets.

 “We were sure that our chief minister would be getting the symbol of cycle. This will further strengthen our chances of a win in the Assembly elections. Now, the candidates won’t have to worry about campaigning with a new election symbol,” said Krishna Murti Singh Yadav, SP district president. 
 
 “The party organisation at Allahabad was constituted by Akhilesh and now this news means it is celebration time for us. Every party worker will work day and night to ensure a win for the chief minister,” said Iftikhar Husain, SP city president. 
 
 “Till now we were campaigning in our respective constituencies but without the party symbol. Now, we will be continuing with the campaigning with our party symbol,” said Richa Singh, the SP candidate from City West assembly seat.
