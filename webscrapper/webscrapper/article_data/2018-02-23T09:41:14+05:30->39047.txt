 Growth in the manufacturing sector has been hit badly. While in 2015-16, the manufacturing sector grew at 7.1%, the next year the growth came down to 1.64%. Experts say that   has lost the race in wooing industries due to various reasons. Though the government claims that no company has left the state, several firms have expanded their base in other states.
 
 “Demonetisation affected almost all states, though in different measure. Since Tamil Nadu is a manufacturing state, the growth has been affected badly as cash was the main source for business here,” said chief policy advisor (E&Y India) D K Srivastava. He also said the growth was low because the state government was not active. “There is a policy paralysis in the state due to which not many companies are ready to invest in Tamil Nadu,”   added.
 
 Compared to big industrialised states, Tamil Nadu’s growth alone has come down. Gujarat’s growth increased from 7.80% to 9.18%. “Tamil Nadu, since the death of former chief minister  , has an inactive government. The state government is at the mercy of the Centre, which does not seem to extend any help. This has affected the state’s economic growth,” said economist Venkatesh Athreya.
 
 Fall in growth rate, especially in the manufacturing sector, has a huge impact on employment generation. “There are many states in the country which are wooing industries through various policies. But Tamil Nadu hardly has an industrial policy in place. When there is no industrial growth, educated youth will be without job, and the employment growth will also be low,” said another economist not willing to be named.
 
 Historic drought in Tamil Nadu in 2016-17 hit the agriculture sector badly. It had a telling effect on the economy as well.
