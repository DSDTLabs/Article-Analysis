AHMEDABAD: Even as   posted a third   on   on Thursday, which alleged that he was not given a chance to justify his allegations during the inquiry, the   said that after a series of letters to the BSF DG, IGP Gujarat Frontier and DIG Bhuj in mid-2016, an inquiry was ordered on August 22 and Choudhary was called for a hearing under the BSF Act, but he did not present evidence supporting his allegations.

 BSF officials said that during the inquiry on August 30, 2016, Choudhary told the presiding officer that he would only reply in writing and only to a written questionnaire.
 
 “A letter to DG BSF, Choudhary wrote that he ought be promoted as he was being made to work at that level and was entitle to the pay for it. He threatened to drag the force to court if his complaints were not heeded,” a senior BSF official said.
 
 Choudhary, who is posted as “head constable – ministerial (clerk)” at Gandhidham, in his latest video says that harassment by his senior could have forced him to suicide. BSF officials said that Choudhary had also written to his DIG, threatening suicide.
 
 BSF officials said, however, when he was summoned for his statement, he said he would not provide more evidence. “He never named any seniors who harassed him nor did he mention any such instance. He just continued with vague allegations,” a senior BSF official said.
 
 In his latest video, Chouhan, named two seniors and accused them of harassment. Chouhan uploaded an audio recording allegedly of a senior officer asking him to leave the administration office.
 
 Top BSF officials said though the inquiry was conducted earlier, they issued a recall notice to Chouhan who is on leave in Bikaner. “We have a grievance redressal system and to put such allegations on social media is a dangerous trend being seen in a force which always stands for discipline and the safety of the country. He will be given another chance to present evidence at the inquiry,” added a BSF official.
