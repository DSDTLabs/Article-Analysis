CHENNAI:   on the city's first bicycle track in KK Nagar may become a thing of the past after the city police announced that they have started impounding vehicles of offenders.

 R-7 station Inspector (law and order wing) M S Bhaskar told TOI that car wheels will be clamped and two-wheelers impounded, if the vehicles are found parked on the cycle track area along   from March 1.
 
 "We will enforce the penalty on Lakshmanaswamy Salai initially as the cycle track work on   and P T Rajan Salai is incomplete," he said.
 Ahead of this move, Bhaskar said his team had completed an awareness drive by reaching out to local residents and shop owners in the area.
 
 When TOI visited Lakshmanaswamy Salai on Wednesday, between 7.30 am and 9 am, there were three cars and 20 two-wheelers found parked on the entire stretch of the cycle track. A Babu, a resident of 7th sector, said that the cycle tracks had been rendered useless since they were constructed, due to encroachments. "From those who visit the banks or petty shops on the road, and even morning walkers, all of them park their vehicles on the cycle track," he said.
 
 To avoid a head-on collision with the public, the corporation and traffic police have worked out a compro-mise. Accordingly, the public will be allowed to use the footpath on one side to park vehicles on the condition that there is no encroachment on the bicycle track-cum-footpath on the opposite side.
 The contractor has begun placing a number of no- parking signs along the stretch. Inspector Bhaskar said members of the public should assist the police to ensure the enforcement drive is a success.
 
 "We can also book offenders under life  , due to haphazard parking on footpath, if the public are willing to come forward and submit a complaint to us," he added.
