Nagpur: To pay off cricket betting debts, two teenagers had taken to seeking out people selling high end bikes, worth over Rs1.25lakh each, on the online marketing platform ‘OLX’, and sneaking away with the bikes on the pretext of taking test rides. Koradi police netted the duo at Ghorpad in Kamptee with the help of the cyber cell and recovered four bikes worth over Rs4 lakh on Thursday.

 The accused, 20-year-old Suraj Nagdive, who has mobile theft records against him, and his accomplice Deepak Pradhan (19), who has no previous record, are residents of Ghorpad.
 
 Senior police inspector Satish Gorade said the duo had taken to this modus operandi around four months ago. They had neither changed the original registration number plates of the stolen bikes, nor switched off their mobile phones, which helped cops trace their location. He added that Pradhan was burdened with debts and came up with the trick to get easy money.
 
 “Shantanu Madokar (18), who had registered a complaint at Koradi police station in May this year, informed cops that he had seen a bike, just like his stolen bike, in Ghorpad. Accordingly, cops laid the trap and nabbed the accused,” Gorade told TOI.
 
 During investigations, cops recovered three other bikes, stolen from Jaripatka, Hudkeshwar and Ganeshpeth.
 
 “The accused used to mortgage these bikes to youngsters in exchange for sums like Rs20,000 and over. They used to promise to repay the loan taken against the bikes and collect it, but never showed up again,” said cops.
 
 The duo was produced before the court on Friday, which remanded them to police custody for three days.
