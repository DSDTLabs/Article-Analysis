NAGPUR: Chief minister   on Saturday claimed that samadhan shibirs have benefited crores of people in the state. The shibirs are held every year in all assembly constituencies of the state. Fadnavis stated this while addressing the inauguration of second samadhan shibir for   constituency, which he represents.

 A large number of citizens were provided documents at the camp. Battery operated tricycles were distributed to handicapped persons. Many other complaints of residents from the constituency were resolved. People can lodge their complaints on Sunday too. The venue is Hyderabad House in Civil Lines.
 
 Fadnavis asked guardian minister Chandrashekhar   to organize a mega camp for distribution of ownership documents to slum dwellers. “We have been holding small camps so far. I want a bigger one in which pattas are issued in bulk,” he said.
 
 The CM further said that his government had started registering construction workers and would provide all types of benefits to them and their children. “Any government is doing this for the first time,” he added.
 
 Earlier, Bawankule informed the gathering about the various works done by the state government. He appealed Fadnavis to sanction Rs125 crore for completing various works of Nagpur South-West constituency.
