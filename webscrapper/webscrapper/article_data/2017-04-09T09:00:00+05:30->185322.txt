AHMEDABAD: One day after the Supreme Court of India asked six states, including Gujarat, to reply on why   should not be banned, the state government, which drew flak after the July 11 Una flogging incident and the lynching of a   by self-styled cow protectors, has decided to make a dossier on “real gau rakshaks”.

 PM Narendra Modi in August last year said that 80% gau rakshaks were “fake” and his government the Gujarat government for a dossier on details of real and fake cow protectors.
 
 The state regime has swung into action, eight months after the two incidents that shook the conscience of the country, only when the   sought a reply on cow protectors within three months, in connection with a PIL filed by Congress leaders Tehseen and Shehzad Poonawalla seeking to declare gau rakshaks’ groups illegal, said sources.
 
 Highly placed sources in the government said, “The state   will soon start screening gau rakshaks and various organisations involved in the activity of cow protection. The sources said that the government will provide identity cards to gau rakshaks and will register them through an online process.”
 
 “The state government will streamline activities of gau rakshaks, as they cannot take the law into their hands. They just have to give inputs about slaughter of cow or cow progeny or   of the livestock, said sources, adding that the state home department and police would prepare the dossier to submit to Union government.
 
 This development comes in wake of the Gujarat government’s populist step, of passing a bill raising the punishment from seven years to life for those found guilty of cow slaughter.
