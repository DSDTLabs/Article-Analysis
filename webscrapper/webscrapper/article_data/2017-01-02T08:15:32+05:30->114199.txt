BHOPAL: Sweet and sour fibrous orange is literally leaving a bitter taste in the farmer's mouth. Post-demonetisation, thousands of orange farmers in Agar-Malwa district incurred losses in several crore in November-December harvest season. 

 And as the cash crunch continues, crisis for March-April season stares hard thousands of farmers cultivating orange on 40,000 hectares of land in the district. 
 
 In the absence of cash, orange orchards are yet to be auctioned. 
 
 "It's a double whammy," said Durga Paliwal, 60, a farmer cultivating citrus fruit over 100 acres of land in Agar.
 
 "At a time your are required to handle at least Rs 3 lakh in cash to pay labourers, who come especially from Maharashtra to pluck oranges, to pay transporter to carry fruit to markets and the cash is also required to be paid to wooden carton manufacturers in which the fruit is placed."
 
 Paliwal and his family is into farming for ages. Mukesh Jain, another farmer, who grows oranges on 40 acres of land, said, "More than 7,000 families come from villages of neighbouring Maharashtra to pluck oranges in November-December every year. They are specialists, who know how to handle the delicate fruit. But this time their number is not even 50."
 
 As there were less labourers, all oranges could not be plucked. The result was fruits over-ripened on plants, resulting in less than expected returns for farmers and businessmen.
 
 Pawan Mangal, who is harvesting oranges on 10 acres of land, said, "Looking at prevailing situation and continuing restrictions on cash withdrawal, traders are not showing interest in auctioning of orchards for crop that would go to market in March and April."
 
 Paliwal said the farmers have incurred huge losses as a lot of money was spent on manure and insecticides among other farming activities to maintain the crop.
