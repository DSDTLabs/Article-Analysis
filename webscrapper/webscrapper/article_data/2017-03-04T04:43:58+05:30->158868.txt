NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court clarified on Friday that a plea of a consortium of banks against businessman   for recovery of Rs 9,000 crore was shifted to a new bench on the direction of the Chief Justice of India.

 As the case was taken up for hearing, a bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit said, “There is a specific order of the CJI” and that was why matter was listed before it. The court’s clarification came after Mallya’s lawyer C SVaidyanathan had objected during the last hearing to the matter being listed before a bench headed by Justice Goel when the case was extensively heard by a bench headed by Justice  .
 
 On the last hearing on February 27, the bench had adjourned the case saying it would first find out why the matter was listed before it. “It is about the institution and individuals do not matter,” Justice Goel said while referring to the CJI’s order.
 
 Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the consortium of banks led by SBI, told the bench that   had transferred $40 million received from Diageo, the British liquor major, to his children’s accounts in “flagrant violation” of various judicial orders, including those passed by the   and the Karnataka high court.
 
 Divan urged the bench to direct Mallya to bring back the money deposited in overseas banks to the country to repay his debt. He said the businessman should be directed to appear in person before the court if he failed to bring back $40 million. The court, after a brief hearing, posted the matter for March 9.
 
 The consortium of banks had approached the apex court seeking repayment of Rs 9,000 crore given to   Ltd.
