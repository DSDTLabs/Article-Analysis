LUCKNOW:   appears to be the best prepared party than its rivals for UP elections. 

 The party quietly started its campaign about a year ago by placing the candidates in the constituencies as ‘Vidhan Sabha Prabhari’. The BSP chief also deputed her senior leaders to start the campaign months before the elections. While Mayawati’s aide and party’s Brahmin face Satish Chandra Mishra has organised 50-odd   in over 70 reserved constituencies, another senior leader   has covered entire west UP region. State BSP chief Ram Achal Rajbhar has been holding small public meetings and cadre camps across the state for the past one year.
 
 In fact, Mayawati, who is known to hit the ground just days before the election notification, has addressed four big rallies -- in Saharanpur, Azamgarh, Agra and Allahabad -- since August. BSP chief also other occasions like the   and   to rake up political issues and even ensured that her statements reach the people, through print and electronic media. In some constituencies, screens were installed for live telecast of her news conferences and rallies.
 
 “We had decided our candidates about a year ago,” Mayawati said on Tuesday. Sources said BSP leaders have been passing on a set of dossiers and other documents, including Mayawati’s press statements, to electorate through various means, including social media. Political experts say BSP is known for carrying out silent campaigns that largely go unnoticed by its rivals. BSP’s associated groups like BAMCEF and Bahujan Voluntary Force, too, have been working in tandem to mobilze Dalits and voters from other communities.
