One of the few female rappers in the country, Siri is known for her rapping skills in Kannada, English and Hindi.
 
  I’ve always felt that rapping and hip-hop is a form of self-expression and I began rapping four years back. I could relate to this one song and thought ‘why not give it a try’. It just happened and I haven’t looked back since. 
 
  To be honest, it feels a little lonely as there aren’t many women who rap. Rapping and   have mostly been a male dominated art form and there haven’t been a lot of women in the field. They say rapping is a form of expression. If you ask me, I feel women have more to say and express than men. I do not feel the need to make an extra effort just because I’m a woman. In the industry, you automatically get that extra attention for being a female rapper, which is annoying. Why can’t they just see the talent irrespective of the gender? There are a lot of women artistes out there. People just need to sit up and take notice.
 
  That is something, which is not in my hand. What I can do is to put myself out there, so that people see that there is a woman who is rapping and try out the same. It will be great if it happens soon. I want to tell others to do their own thing. There is nothing more rewarding than doing something you like.
