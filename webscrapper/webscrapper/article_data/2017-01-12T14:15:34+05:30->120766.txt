SURAT: The   (I-T) department and   are zeroing in on another city-based financier who had opened 36 new accounts in   between November 8 and December 30, 2016, to give legitimacy through money laundering to Rs1.1 crore worth of old notes with him that he first deposited in these suspicious accounts. 

 For the past one week, Vipul Jasoliya is under the scanner of many government departments whose officials are verifying a pile of documents, computer data and materials recovered from his four lockers of a private safe deposit vault in the city as well as from his house at Utran. 
 
 The I-T department stumbled upon Jasoliya’s transactions while carrying out a routine survey of accounts of Varachha Cooperative Bank. The I-T department officials found that 36 accounts had suspicious entries. They nabbed an associate of Jasoliya when he came to the bank. 
 
 “The financier’s associate gave details about Jasoliya bank accounts and lockers which were later seized from the former’s house at Utran last week. Officials also recovered new currency notes worth Rs13 lakh from the financier’s house,” a bank officer said. 
 
 Bank sources said Jasoliya had opened accounts in Varachha   in the names of his family members, partners and friends. He has several accounts in other banks too, which are yet to be detected, they added. Jasoliya is the second financier after Kishor Bhajiyawala who has been caught in the city trying to defraud the banking system in the country.
