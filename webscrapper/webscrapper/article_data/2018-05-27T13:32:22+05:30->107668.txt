HYDERABAD: Unlike other years, it was students from the commerce stream — and not science — who walked away with the top laurels in the Central Board of Secondary Education’s ( ) class 12 results that were declared on Saturday. A quick scan of the students’ performance showed that majority of the toppers, across city schools, were from the commerce stream.

 
 “The performance of students from the commerce stream saw a major jump this year. We have three students from the stream this year who shared the top spot with 97.4 per cent,” said  , principal of Delhi Public School,  , which had 250 students — the highest in the city for class 12 — take the test this year.
 
 
  
 Analysis of the score sheets shared by various schools revealed that many students secured high marks in economics, business studies and mathematics. “The retest of the economics paper may have certainly helped a few students to get better marks. Apart from this, we also saw a rise in scores in business studies this year,” said  , director education, Silver Oaks International Schools.
 
 
 Following a paper leak, the CBSE re-conducted the economics test on April 25, almost a month after it was first taken by candidates, triggering widespread outrage and confusion among students across India.
 
 
 City schools that had toppers from the commerce stream were Chirec Public School, P Obul Reddy Public School, Army Public School ( Bollarum), Meridian School, Delhi Public School (Nacharam) among others.
 
 
 Despite physics being a tough nut to crack this year, it couldn’t deter students from scoring impressive marks. “Almost 70 per cent of the students from our school secured high marks in physics. The highest marks secured by our student in the subject is 95,” said Raj Shekhar, principal of Kennedy High, the Global School, which registered a 100 per cent pass percentage.
