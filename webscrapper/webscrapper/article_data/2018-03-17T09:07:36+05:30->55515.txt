MUMBAI: Triumph Knights Mumbai North East allrounder   seems to be the flavour of the inaugural edition of the T20 Mumbai League. While he fashioned his team’s chase against the Sobo Supersonics on the tournament opener’s first night, on Friday, he slammed a last ball six to earn his team a thrilling win against the Na-Mo Bandra Blasters.

 
 Requiring to chase 184 for win, The Knights, after a decent start, found themselves in a soup. They required 50 runs off the last 16 balls, which seemed impossible to chase, especially with five wickets down and skipper Suryakumar Yadav (44) back in the hut. Parkar, in the company Vinayak Bhior (unbeaten 18), plundered the runs with consummate ease.
 
 Parkar began the onslaught, slamming 23 runs off medium pacer Azhar Ansari’s penultimate over. Bhoir then slammed two sixes of the first two balls to make the winning equation 9 runs off 4 balls. The Knights needed six off the last delivery and Bhoir was impressively despatched over the mid-wicket boundary by Parkar.
 
 
  NaMo Bandra Blasters 183 for 5 (Shreyas Iyer 72, Aman Khan 85; Kalpesh Sawant 2 for 3) lost to Triumph Knights Mumbai NE 184 for 5 (Shashank Singh 42, Suryakumar Yadav 36, Akash Parkar 39 not out, Vinayak Bhoir 19 not out; Prashant Bhoir 2 for 47) by 5 wickets; Thursday night: Shivaji Park Lions 135 for 9 in 20 overs (Siddharth Akre 39, Raunaq Sharma 28,   4-18, Shivam Malhotra 2-14) lost to North Mumbai Panthers 138 for 5 in 19.4 overs (Yashasvi Jaiswal 69, Yogesh Takawale 23, Sagar Trivedi 2-26,   2-19) by five wickets.
