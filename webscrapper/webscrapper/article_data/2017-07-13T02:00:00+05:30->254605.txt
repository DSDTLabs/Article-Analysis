PATNA: The Bihar Secondary School Teacher’s Association ( ) has expressed doubts over the state education department’s action plan to improve education system. 

 BSSTA general secretary Shatrughan Prasad Singh cited the problem of acute shortage of teachers in schools as a major bottleneck. “There are 3,000 secondary schools and senior secondary schools across the state, but at least 50% of the posts of teacher in these schools are vacant,” he said, adding these many schools require 70,000 teachers.
 
 “Under a short-term action plan (three months), the education department asked the district education officers and district programme officers to ensure that no school lagged behind in completing the syllabus. As an immediate measure, the department has been given the go-ahead to make ad hoc appointments on contract of BTech or MTech degree holders.
 
 “Why should a BTech or MTech holder take a job of Rs 5,500-20,200 whereas the original payscale of a schoolteacher is Rs 9,300-34,800,” he said.
