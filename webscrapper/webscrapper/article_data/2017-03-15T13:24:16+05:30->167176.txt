On Saturday,   took off for a skiing trip to   with close buddy Taj. The 33-year-old actor reveals that as a child he used to hate skiing because he'd keep tumbling down but now is eager to reconnect with the winter sport well knowing that it would require lots of patience and mental alertness.

  
  
 Speaking to Mirror from Gulmarg, Amit said, "I'm doing a four-day beginner's course right now. I've had a few falls but in skiing, falling is a part of the learning process and I'm back on the slopes after a really long time. My trainer, Fayaz, is a national level skier and is very skilled. There's been a lot of fresh snow over the last week." Amit will be seen next in '  3' and when he told   he was off to Gulmarg on a skiing break, the film's writer-director told him, "Please come back in one piece, we have a film to promote and release."
 
 Amit, who returns to the Bay this weekend, admits that while his first love is mountaineering, he's enjoying skiing and would love to go back for another round. "This is the season's last snow. From April the snow will start melting. I hope to be back and brush up my skills on the advanced slopes, Gulmarg is one of the most beautiful places in our country," he signs off.
