Margao: GPCC pressient and Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro, on Friday, assured his Navelim constituents, particularly those opposing the ongoing works of the   route, that the state government will soon sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the affected residents, who will be provided alternate housing. Until the new houses are built, the affected residents will be provided accommodation, with their rent paid by the government.

 “There are two disturbing aspects regarding the western bypass route that passes through the Navelim constituency. The first being the environment issue as it would pass through the Saipem lake near River Sal, which is a catchment area with paddy fields on its banks. The second is regarding the compensation to be paid to those whose homes and properties will be destroyed,” Faleiro stated.
 
  Stating that he met Parrikar on March 30, Faleiro said, “I am grateful to Parrikar for arriving at an understanding wherein all officers concerned were called in to discuss the environment and compensation issues. Chief minister Manohar Parrikar has assured that the road passing through the Saipem lake will be constructed on stilts, as well as a flyover”.
 
 “Besides, the government has decided that local residents will not be affected as they will be provided alternate temporary accomodation, with the rent being paid by the government. The state government will also construct new houses for these three affected residents before March 31, 2018,” Faleiro said. 
 
 “The unused man-made lake lies in what is today the catchment area for most of Margao town, which witnesses flooding during monsoon. But, the lake is polluted with sewage and garbage. Parrikar has promised that the ongoing sewerage works will be completed and that the lake will be desilted and restored to its original pristine condition and turned into a recreational spot in Navelim,” the GPCC president said.
