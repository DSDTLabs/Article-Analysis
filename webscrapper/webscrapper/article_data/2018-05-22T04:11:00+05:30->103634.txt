Vadodara: Two days after they witnessed a gruesome accident at Dena Chowkdi on National Highway 8, the villagers have reiterated their demand for an underpass at the spot. Residents of Dena village have shot off a letter to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and demanded construction of an underpass on the NH 8. “The villagers have been demanding an underpass at Dena Chowkdi since a long time. They have written letters to us too. We don’t have any authority in this matter so we forwarded their demands to the NHAI that is the final authority,” said Amita Vanani, ACP (traffic). Vanani told TOI that they also gave another alternative to the NHAI. “The NHAI can construct an alternative service road that will connect with the road passing under the bridge near Dena chowkdi. The villagers can use this road to reach on the other side of the highway. It can prevent many accidents,” Vanani added. The locals have also written to the local politicians but didn’t get much help. On May 7, a resident of Dena village was knocked down by a moving car at the same crossroad. The locals had created a ruckus and blocked the highway. They demanded speed-breakers to be made ahead of the Dena Chowkdi but NHAI doesn’t make speed bumps on highways. The Dena Chowkdi witnessed yet another ruckus on May 19 when four vehicles collided into each other at the crossroad. The incident occurred when driver of a private college bus applied brakes suddenly after spotting a stationary car and a tractor. A truck behind the bus couldn’t stop in time and rammed into the bus that crashed into the car and tractor. Five students travelling in the bus suffered injuries following which the locals blocked the highway again.
