ROHTAK: In an effort to cover up his act after his claim of defeating the BJP in Uttar Pradesh by moblising support of Jat community fell flat, All India Jat Aarakshan Sangrash Samiti (AIJASS) national president   claimed that Jat voters had backed the saffron party as it had become a Hindu-Muslim fight.

 Malik, who visited the sit-ins at Jassia and   on Sunday, said that since Jats had voted for the BJP in UP, which led to its landslide victory. Now, it was the latter’s turn to fulfil its commitment of extending reservation to the community, he added.
 
 On his opponents’ claims that Malik does not have a support base in western UP, the AIJASS chief said that it was because of his pressure that BJP national president Amit Shah had to publicly say that party supported Jats’ demand during the election. “Modi also had to include former Prime Minister and Jat leader Charan Singh’s name in his speech during an election rally to appease the farming and Jat community in party’s favour,” he claimed.
 
 Refusing to bring any change post election results in five states, Malik said that the community members would assemble in Delhi at its scheduled time for gheraoing parliament on March 20. The AIJASS had given a call to the Jat community in   and other north states to reach Delhi on March 20 to force the central government to agree to their demands.
 
 Meanwhile, community members who were present at the sit-ins donned black attires and raised slogans against state and central government. Later, they burnt the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, holding them responsible for forcing them to sit on dharnas for the past 45 days across the state.
