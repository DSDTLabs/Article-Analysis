Trichy: At just Rs 8 a kg, the price of   has taken a steep fall in Trichy over the last few days. Last month, the price of the vegetable was around Rs 30 – 35 per kg. Traders at the   in the city stated that the fall in price was mainly owing to the increase in supply and lower demand.

 “At a time when selling one bundle of cabbage itself is a big task and we are provided with two or three more bundles, it is only obvious that we have to decrease the price to sell them off,” said  , who works at a vegetable shop at Gandhi Market. 
 
 “Cabbages mostly come from Bengaluru and the supply has increased significantly over the last few weeks,” he added. “We don’t sell the unsold cabbages the next day, so it is absolutely crucial that we reduce the price so that we don’t incur losses,” he added.
 
 Other reasons for the fall in prices of vegetables are the cultivation trends of farmers and increase in number of markets in the city, claim a few traders.
 
 M Thangamani, manager at V S   vegetable shop at Gandhi market, said that many farmers cultivate a particular crop which would be highly priced at that point of time. “Take tomato for example, if the price of the vegetable is high, every farmer starts to cultivate it, which eventually results in bigger supply and lower price,” he said.
 
 Several traders had also predicted that the price of cabbage would increase again in a couple of weeks. “It is not the case only with cabbage – any vegetable which is sold at a steep price would have a drastic fall in the following month. It’s a cycle,” Loganathan said, adding, “For instance, coriander, which was sold for only Rs 5-6 per kg last month, is now being sold at Rs 15-16 a kg.”
