 has been busy lately playing leading roles in Malayalam and is also flooded with offers in Tamil. Up until 2015 though the situation was markedly different as the actor was still only getting offers as a supporting actor.

  credits   for turning it all around. "It had a great subject, a good character and most importantly, it was a   movie. People would watch the film first day, first show and that way they would also watch me," he says, adding that's why he decided to take it up. 
 
 He says while viewing the film in the theatre, he had messaged Prithviraj, telling him that his script selection was good and the movie has come out well. "Prithviraj replied, ‘That’s all fine. From now on, make sure you are careful while selecting your scripts’. I told him that I was in a position to choose only from what I was being offered. It was likely that more supporting roles might come my way and I would select those carefully. He told me, ‘It’s not supporting characters that will find you now but leading roles. Those are the ones you have to choose well.’ I thought he was just saying that for courtesy’s sake, but after the movie almost 95% of the offers were to play hero."
 
 The actor also reveals that most of these offers had run-of-the-mill scripts and producers. "However, there were interesting projects but we just couldn’t get people to fund them. This was in 2015 and the situation was markedly different from what it is now. Currently, that change is almost complete and people are receptive to movies with different subjects and genres," he says.
