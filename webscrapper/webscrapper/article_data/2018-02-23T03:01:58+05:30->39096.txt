NEW DELHI : A day after the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration came out with reasons for implementing compulsory  , members of   Teachers’   have released a ‘point by point’ rebuttal of the administration’s claims. JNUTA said the administration’s arguments are selective and that a meeting called between JNUTA office-holders and the administration on Thursday was “more of a formality than a genuine effort by the administration.”

 In their statement, JNUTA claimed that they were given 30 minutes to talk to the administration. “We have been mailing the VC for a meeting for a week. But this meeting was a mere formality and we are disappointed,” said JNUTA secretary Sudhir Kumar Suthar.
 
 JNUTA members complained that the VC cut short the JNUTA president when she expressed her appreciation for initiating the meeting. When she mentioned that the entire JUNTA EC team would have liked to meet the VC, that was also dismissed by him as irrelevant.
