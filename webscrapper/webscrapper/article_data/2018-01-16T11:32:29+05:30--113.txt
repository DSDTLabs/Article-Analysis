CHANDIGARH: The residents of   behind   have been facing civic disparities in their village since a long time. With the exceedingly small village lanes, the problem of traffic congestion during the rush hours has been affecting the lives of the village dwellers.

 The village has two entry points, one adjacent to Sukhna Lake and the other one near towards the roundabout leading to IT Park. The village dwellers are faced with large volumes of vehicular rush using the two village roads to ferry towards   and Manimajra.
 
 The situation often becomes so grim that the traffic jams paralyze all movement for hours. “The lanes here are narrow. It becomes a mess here in the evening, because cars after cars pour intotheslim space, and if any one of them is parked irresponsibly, the traffic gets jammed,” said  , a village resident.
 
 The parking of vehicles in the village limits is also a difficult task, due to the unavailability of any vacant space. “Only bikes or other two-wheelers can be parked along the road. But with time, a lot of people who live here have managed to buy cars, irrespective of obvious space constraints. Hence, they struggle with finding space to park their cars,” said  , a village resident and a shopkeeper.
 
 According to village dwellers, the problem of traffic congestion has witnessed a steep surge within the past one decade in respect to the village, with more number of automobiles plying on the road now. “With the modernisation of the city, IT Park, DT Mall and other offices have now opened. More and more people from   and Chandigarh have started travelling towards Panchkula and Manimajra and to avoid the main road lights and traffic, they take this route. Since the villag connects both the ends, it suffers with the rush,” added Satyendra, a shopkeeper and resident at Kishangarh.
