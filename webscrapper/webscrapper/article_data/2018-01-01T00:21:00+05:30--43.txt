Trichy: Several passengers including tourists visiting Brihadesswarar temple, Unesco world heritage centre have been complaining about the fleecing of private auto rickshaw drivers as there was no proper agency to monitor the tariff charged by auto rickshaws. To ensure the convenience of rail commuters, Trichy railway division tied up with cab aggregator Ola to install a booking unit cum halting station in an area of 120 sq mt for the app based cabs and auto rickshaws at Thanjavur railway junction to halt and embark visiting tourists and rail commuters through both online and spot booking.

 “The facility was thrown open for public use despite stiff opposition from local auto rickshaw drivers. We have plans to install similar such Ola booking point in Srirangam railway station in an estimated area of 180 sq mt,” K Mohammed Jaffer, manager-operations, Ola told TOI.
