KOHIMA: Hours after Nationalist Democratic   ( ) leader Neiphiu Rio’s unopposed victory from the Northern Angami-II constituency was announced by the Election Commission, the party’s ally, BJP, said the three-time CM will be the chief ministerial candidate for the two-party alliance. 

 The two parties had stitched an alliance on January 3 but had not named any CM candidate then. The newlyfloated NDPP, which is contesting 40 of the 60 seats in the   assembly, will be the senior partner of BJP, which has a share of the remaining 20 seats to contest from. BJP state president Visasolie Lhoungu told TOI on Tuesday, “It has been decided that   will be the chief ministerial candidate. 
 
 The formal announcement will come from New Delhi.” When contacted for comments on BJP state president’s announcement, Rio said, “Ok good. Let the big boss come (PM  ) and say it.”
