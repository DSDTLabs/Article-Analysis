HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) has served a double whammy on consumers. After levying hefty water bills this month much to the chagrin of users, came another shocker when the board on Tuesday decided to collect Rs 1,000 for a 5,000-litre tanker and Rs 2,000 on a 10,000-litre tanker from May 1 from those who fail to set up rainwater harvesting structures (RWHs).

 The decision was taken at a meeting here on Tuesday. Board MD M Dana   said the increased charges will be applicable only to those who fail to construct RWHs by Aprilend. Till now, the rates were Rs 500 for a 5,000-litre tanker and Rs 1,000 for a 10,000-litre tanker.
 
 It may be recalled the board had already decided to stop tanker supplies to non-domestic (commercial establishments and industries) users if they fail to construct RWHs on their premises by April-end.
 
 Kishore explained that committees have been set up to review the construction of RWHs in both domestic and non-domestic categories, the details of which will later be uploaded in computers. “Once a consumer books a tanker, the latest software system will zero in on the status of construction of   structure on his/her premises. Based on the feedback, we will collect the charges from the domestic consumers and stop the supplies to non-domestic consumers if we find that RWHs are not in place,” he said.
 
 The board has also extended the date for receiving nominations for the best apartment and best gated community for setting up RWHs to March 17. The board also also appealed to officials and NGOs to encourage consumers to avail loan facility to construct RWHs.
