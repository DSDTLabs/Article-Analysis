BHOPAL: The   forest department’s wildlife wing has handed over dossiers on five notorious tiger poachers to the Nepal CIB, seeking help in their arrest.

 
 The most wanted of them is  , 43, who has an   red corner notice in his name on the basis of an application moved by STF in 2016. STF officials refused to reveal the identity of the four others, saying they may flee to other countries. All of them are residents of Nepal.
 
 Tamang is wanted in connection with the poaching of a radio-collared tiger in Satpura tiger reserve and hundreds of pangolins in MP. The five are alleged to be part of a global syndicate, comprising Myanmarese and Chinese nationals, targeting near-extinct wildlife species.
 
 
 
 
 There were regular inputs on seizure of tiger hides — apparently poached from protected areas of MP — in countries like Ethiopia and Nepal, but this is the first time the MP government has approached Interpol.
 
 Officials believe a breakthrough into the international syndicate would help them expedite investigation in many cases that had hit a roadblock following restrictions at international borders. Some cases are pending for a decade.
 
 MPSTF had sent a dossier of ‘most wanted foreign nationals’ to CBI, which is national central bureau (NCB) for Interpol in India. NCB forwarded the report to Interpol’s general secretariat HQ in   (France).
 
 “We have provided details of the crimes committed by them in MP. Once they are arrested we will be able to solve many cases,” said an STF officer.
 
 Interpol had contacted MP government for details about Tamang after his arrest by MPSTF from Delhi’s Majnu ka Tila area for trading in pangolin scales and tiger hides in October 2015. He secured bail from a local court in MP immediately after the arrest. MPSTF moved high court challenging the bail and got it cancelled in February this year. He had been on run ever since.
