Rajkot: The Junagadh district administration on Monday restricted movement of all kinds of equine animals (belonging to the horse family) including horses, donkeys and mules, following detection of fatal glanders disease in Jamalvadi area of the district. 

 The notification of restriction was issued under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Disease in Animal Act, 2009.
 
 According to an official statement by the Junagadh district administration, legal action will be taken against those animal owners who violate this notification. 
 
 Junagadh’s veterinary doctor Hemal Gujarati told TOI, “We found this disease in the horses brought from north India. Last year, we found two infected horses which were brought from north India.” 
 
 The disease is commonly contracted by consuming food or water contaminated by the nasal discharge of carrier animals. After an incubation period of about two weeks, affected animals usually have blood infection and high fever. 
 
 A thick nasal discharge is seen and the animal has trouble breathing and develops other respiratory problems. Death occurs within a few days of infection. The disease is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei. Glanders can causes ulcers in the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and skin of the animal. Humans and other animals are also susceptible to the infection.
 
 The statement further said that officials of the animal husbandry department have started inspection of houses and are sending blood samples to laboratories for testing. 
 
 In July 2016, as many as 40 equines including over a dozen horses and mules, across the state, were put to sleep after they were found infected with this highly contagious and fatal disease found in the horse family. 
 
 There are around 18,500 horses and ponies besides over 40,000 mules and donkeys in Gujarat, according to the state animal husbandry department.
