CHARMINAR: As the mercury level continues to rise, much to the discomfort of residents, a group of youngsters in Old City have started preparing a cool drink (sharbat) that they serve to the devotees every Friday outside local mosques.

 The group consists of 5-6 members from Muhajireen Camp. They have set up a camp behind   and serve the cool drink free of cost to the faithful every Friday after prayers.
 
 Syed Saddam, Mohammed Ahmed, Mohammed Qasim and   are part of the group. They said the intention of this service was to create awareness among those who were welloff, to reach out to people at the time of need, especially during summer.
 
 Cool water cans and pots were placed before shops and along the roadsides for people at many places, but the trend of distributing refreshing cool drink at masjids is on the rise in Old City. Locals and youths come forward every week and contribute whatever they can, according to their capacity, and help in making the cool drink for the devout.
 
 “We have been doing this work for the last three years. Likewise, this time around we have come up here with the facility. We individually come forward for contributions. Such service make us happy and we plan to extend this facility further,” said  .
 
 “The cool drink is made with Roohafza with sabja seeds and ice. We make around 300 litres of this every Friday. After   prayers, we offer the cool drink to devotees. The work is appreciated by the people here. We have decided to enhance this facility for the devotees in the coming days,” said Mohammed Ahmed.
