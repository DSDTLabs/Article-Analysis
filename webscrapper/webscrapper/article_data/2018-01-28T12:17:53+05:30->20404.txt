SURAT: Textile traders called a public meeting at Millennium Textile Market on   on Saturday in which they demanded simplification of the e-way bill which is proposed to be implemented by the central government across the country from February 1. 

 Traders had invited Navsari MP C R Paatil and BJP MLAs from Majura and   assembly constituencies —Harsh Sanghavi and   — to put forth a strong representation to the Centre on the issues faced by the traders community because of the Goods and Servie Tax (GST) and the proposed e-way bill. 
 
 Most of the traders, who addressed the public meeting, believe that the e-way bill’s implementation from February 1 will force the traders to shut their shops. At every stage of delivery of goods, be it the supply to the job workers, textile mills, handwork or embroidery, the traders will have to prepare the e-way bill, which is practically a difficult process. 
 
 A textile trader   said, “The traders want simplification of the GST law. First came the GST, now the government is preparing to implement the e-way bill. The traders will not be able to do business in a free environment as they used to do earlier. The small traders will have to literally shut down their shops as they won’t be able to generate e-way bill.”
 
 The traders urged Paatil to strongly represent their concern to the central government. 
 
 “At present, the business turnover in the textile markets is less than 30 per cent. This is all due to GST. We want the government to provide us with a free environment to do our business, otherwise many will shut their shops after February 1,” a textile trader   said. 
 
 Paatil assured that the issues and problems of the traders community will be strongly represented to the ministries concerned in New Delhi. 
 
 “I will definitely raise the issues discussed by the traders in the meeting. The government will try to simplify GST too for the traders,” Paatil said.
