CHENNAI: Pristine Cooum is an oxymoron. But, the state government once imagined the sewage filled waterway could be cleaned and made navigable. A fragment of this grand plan still exists on the silted banks along   -a jetty, which, as it turns out, is not just a remnant of the early promise of Dravidian politics but also its lasting symbol of failure.

 Overgrown with vegetation, a concrete platform is all that is visible of the jetty from the bridge linking the trident of College Road, Moores Road and Greams Road with Pantheon Road.As vehicles speed past, with not a moment to spare at what has since come to be defined as a waste of public funds, a question of `what if ' comes to mind. What if there were boats that docked here and unloaded passengers, a throwback to the British era when the   was a medium of transport.
 
 But the Cooum, during colonial times too, was not navigable, says historian R Venkatesh. “The Cooum was never used for boating as it was not a perennial river,“ he said. “Boats used to move on this stretch only when the governor was invited for the convocation of The College, run by the  , in the early 19th century. The governors used to travel from Rajaji Hall to The College, which is now the  ,“ he said, adding that jetties came up during the DMK government under M Karunanidhi in the 1970s.
 
 The DMK had launched a series of measures to restore the river under the  . Karunanidhi, first as public works department minister in C N Annadurai's government and later as the chief minister, oversaw the construction of seven jetties.
 
 The project cost the exchequer `2.2 crore. The government then launched the short-lived pleasure boating service.
 
 Successive governments did nothing to revive the project, allowing vegetation to gradually consume the structures. Today , sludge brushes against the crumbling base of this structure, reminding us of an unfulfilled dream.
