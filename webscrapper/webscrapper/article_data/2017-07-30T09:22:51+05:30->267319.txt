NAGPUR: Like a legendary Russian pole vaulter  , Nagpur shuttlers keep breaking their own records this season to establish themselves as the new powerhouse of state  .

 On June 9 at Parbhani, city shuttlers set a record by winning three titles and one runner-up finish. On July 8 at Karad, they improved their own performance by claiming five titles and one runner-up trophy.
 
 They perhaps reserved their best for the third and final tournament of the season and captured historic eight titles and two runner-up trophy to virtually make a clean sweep in the Goel Ganga Maharashtra Junior State Open Badminton Championship, organized by the Nagpur District Badminton Association (NDBA), here on Saturday.
 
 On the sixth and final day of the competiton at the Divisional Sports Complex in Mankapur, city shuttlers made the most of home advantage to rule the roost.
 
 Malvika Bansod and Ritika Thaker led the Nagpur’s charge with a double crown each. While Malvika swept the singles titles, Ritika (with her Mumbai Suburban partner  ) emerged champion in both the doubles.
 Fifteen-year-old Rohan Gurbani retained his U-17 boys singles crown without much trouble. Sourabh Kerhalkar completed the hat-trick of the season by reigning supreme in the U-19 boys doubles with his partner Deep Rambhiya (Mumbai).
 
 Sudhanshu Bhure triumphed in the U-17 boys doubles, while Rashi Lambe retained her mixed doubles crown with Akshay Shetty.
 
 Malvika was clearly the star of the day. The 15-year-old southpaw repeated her historic twin singles titles and proved that Karad effort was no fluke. Incidentally, she became the first player from the state to perform such an outstanding feat.
 
 “I am extremely happy to retain both the singles titles. It was a great feeling to achieve this feat. Now, I want to stamp my authority at the higher level and win the singles title at the forthcoming All India Junior tournament at Chennai. I missed the U-17 singles title by a whisker at Jodhpur but I want to make amends in the next tourney,” a jubilant Malvika told TOI after her U-19 girls singles final against her practice partner Rashi Lambe.
 In the U-17 girls singles summit clash, top seed Malvika, a student of Standard XI of Shivaji Science College, thumped Siddhi Jadhav 21-15, 21-7.
 
 The last match of the tournament was a treat to watch between the two regular practice partners Malvika and Rashi. Both the players gave their best in the hard-fought first game, which Malvika won 21-18. But after losing the opener, Rashi conceded the final midway through the second game because she could not continue because of fatigue.
 
 Ritika and Simran maintained their dominance in the doubles section by grabbing both the U-17 and U-19 titles.
 The U-19 boys singles crown was pocketed by top seed Arya Bhivpathaki. The Pune teenager rallied to pip his citymate Rishabh Deshpande in a thriller. 
 
 Saoner MLA Sunil Kedar and Maharashtra Badminton Association (MBA) president Arun Lakhani distributed the prizes. NDBA president Kunda Vijaykar, MBA vice-president Ashish Bajpai, MBA secretary SA Shetty, Gurunath Khubba, NDBA secretary Mangesh Kashikar, NDBA joint secretary Naresh Chafekar and other MBA and NDBA officials were present on the occasion.
