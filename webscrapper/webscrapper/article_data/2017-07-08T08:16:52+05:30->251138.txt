PIMPRI CHINCHWAD:The civic authorities, in a bid to serve even the most   of places, have started two new zones whose offices will become operational in a week. 

 The municipal limits of   city were hitherto divided into six administrative zones — A, B, C, D, E and F. Thanks to the city’s 22-lakh strong population, development is taking place at a rapid pace in fringe areas. As a result, for many fringe area residents, their respective zonal offices are too far away. This prompted the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation to increase the number of zones by two. 
 
 “With the two new zones, G and H, there will be eight zones in the city. There are 32 wards in the city, with each ward comprising four panels. Each zone will now cater to four wards, and will have 16 corporators from as many panels,” said ruling party leader  .
 
 Initially, corporators had put forth a proposal to create four additional zones, but the administration had expressed its inability to provide manpower to the new zones due to staff shortage. The ruling BJP then approved a resolution to carve out two new zones in April’s civic general body meeting.
 
 “The ‘G’ zonal office will be housed on the first floor of the PCMC-run Sai Sharada Women’s Industrial Training Centre building in Kasarwadi. The office for Zone ‘H’ will operate in the municipal school in Thergaon. Both the offices should become operational in a week,” Pawar further added.
 
 Since the civic administration admitted to a shortage of manpower, there was always going to be the question of how   will staff these offices. “We are facing a shortage of   and officials. So, we will have to requisition staff from the existing six zones. We have accordingly sought details of Class IV civic employees working in the areas which come under the new zones,” a senior civic official told TOI.
