ROHTAK: After Jats served an ultimatum to elected representatives on their lack of support to their cause, now members of   have threatened to gherao MLAs and MPs if they supported  . The decision was taken at a meeting of Adarsh Samaj core committee members in Bhiwani on Tuesday.

 On February 19, the All India   Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) had served an ultimatum from Jassia village, saying they would boycott elected representatives in the next elections if they do not support them in their ongoing agitation for reservation in jobs and educational institutes. 
 
 In a meeting headed by Lalchand Jangra on Tuesday at Sector 13 in Bhiwani, it was decided unanimously that they would hand over a memorandum to non-Jat MLAs and MPs over the issue of reservation. “If non-Jat MLAs and MPs come forward to extend their support to Jat reservation, we will gherao them and run a campaign to not vote for them during the next elections,” Jangra maintained.
 
 On the reservation demand of Jats in the   category, Adarsh Samaj leaders threatened that if the government tried to upset the existing 27% reservation then a new stir would take place in the state. Taking on Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Samaj leader Ramesh Tank Prajapati said he was the weakest CM of the state till now. “It does not behove a serving chief minister to hold peace talks with a person who had been booked for sedition,” said Prajapati in a veiled attack on AIJASS chief Yashpal Malik.
 
 Malik had called off the ‘Delhi Kooch’ plan on March 20 after assurances by Khattar in this regard on March 19 in Delhi. Prajapati said such gesture by the head of the state gave a wrong message to the public.
