BHOPAL: Two students of Class 9 and 10 of Army Public School, Dronachal, Neori Hills, filed a complaint on Wednesday against   (BMHRC) director Dr   at the   (MPPCRC) for not releasing their mother’s three months’ salary. As a result of this, they said they are not able to afford coaching class fee and had to discontinue it.

 In a complaint letter, Aviraj Sharma of Class 10 told the commission as his mother is a single parent, delay in release of his mother’s salary would result in a failure to pay fee on time.
 
 “My mother works as a technician at the pathology department of the BMHRC. Her salary was not released since November due to which I had to quit coaching, badly affecting my studies,” said Aviraj in his complaint. He said, “I had to stop going to coaching classes for lack of money. I am worried about the academic session.” The complaint letter is with the TOI.
 
 Mother of Aviraj, Monica Sharma, said, “If I am unable to submit quarterly fee of Rs 19,000/- in January, I hope my son does not miss his board exams. I am also scared my younger son, who is in Class 9 may have to leave the school.” She informed the issue was reported to MP Women’s Commission, and also to the department of health research (DHR), Delhi, which handles the administration of BMHRC since 2015.
 
 “In response to my mail, the DHR informed me deputy finance officer of BMHRC   to release my salary, but nothing has been done,” said Sharma. 
 
 The MPPCRC drafted a letter and this would be delivered to the BMHRC director on Thursday giving 3 days time to specify reason for stopping the employee’s salary. “If the director doesn’t reply in given period, she’ll be asked to attend the hearing in person,” said Brijesh Chauhan member of MPPCRC.
 
 Efforts to get version of the director Dr   proved futile as she did not reply to phone calls and SMS.
