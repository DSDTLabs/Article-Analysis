PATNA: Ever heard of the ‘Dalit Panthers’ of Kanpur? It’s a formidable Ambedkarite movement that has ensured justice to hundreds of dalits in and around Kanpur, according to a docu directed by French anthropologist and filmmaker  .

 Shot between 1997 and 2001 in pockets of Kanpur, the 105-minute documentary – ‘Sangharsh: Struggle is Our Call’ – depicts the lifeworld of ‘Dalit Panthers’ active in and around Kanpur in the late 1990s.
 
 “The film revolves mainly around three activists who spread the revolutionary ideas of B R Ambedkar, a pioneer of social democracy… In the process, they shun the caste system that has enslaved them in its snares for years,” Jaoul, who was in Patna for a special screening of his docu, told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Way back in the early 2000s, Jaoul’s PhD fieldwork took him to Bihar and UP and also to Maharashtra and Punjab, where he studied dalit activism in different ideological contexts like Ambedkarism, Naxalism, Gandhism and Hindutva.
 
 “I was moved by the determination of the ‘Dalit Panthers’ to eradicate the caste system. That was when I decided to chronicle whatever I saw – be it a heated mother-son discussion on the Hindu feudalism or a bunch of ‘Dalit Panthers’ shouting anti-caste slogans with drumsticks in hands,” said Jaoul, who learned filmmaking from French anthropologist Jean Rouch in 1996.
 
 Few years ago, a French TV channel offered to telecast the entire 100-hour footage Jaoul had shot as part of his PhD fieldwork. He, however, declined the offer.
 
 “My documentary received funds from the London School of Economics and the University of Paris for its completion. The long footage was cut short by French editor Gilles Volta last year and the documentary is now ready to enter film festivals across Europe,” Jaoul said.
 
 ‘Sangharsh...’ is considered to be the second documentary film on the Ambedkarite movement after Anand Patwardhan’s ‘Jai Bhim Comrade’ released in 2011.
