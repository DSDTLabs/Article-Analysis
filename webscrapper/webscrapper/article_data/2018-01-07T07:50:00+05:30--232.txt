LUDHIANA: At a time when the verification process under Punjab Shehri Awas Yojna (PSAY) is almost complete, the Ludhiana   has decided to reject more than 60% of the forms (around 960 forms) due to non-fulfilment of conditions.

 The most common reason behind cancellation of forms is the condition of providing 10-year domicile proof. Besides, income bar and no other house in the name of applicants are two other conditions which have become reasons for rejection of forms.
 
 The   had started the verification of more than 1,600 forms in December last year. During the process, they checked whether applicant is residing in the state for the past 10 years and his or her income is not more than Rs 3 lakh a year. Also he or she should not be in a government job and there should not be any other property in his or her name.
 
 The officials claimed that they have checked almost all the forms and more than 60% forms will be rejected because the applicants do not meet the terms and conditions.
 
 From the city, more than 8,000 forms were sent to   (PUDA). The   had hired a private firm for entry of forms related to this scheme. The firm after checking the forms had asked for verification of these 1,600 forms which were sent to MC for the same.
 
 MC joint commissioner   said staff has almost completed the verification of forms in all four zones and they are in process of sending the forms back. He said most of the forms would be rejected.
 
 Since PUDA is the nodal agency for this project, the department has demanded details of available vacant land from   (GLADA), Municipal Corporation (MC) and   (LIT). The MC officials have already sent the details to PUDA. Affordable houses will be constructed on the available land and the PUDA will decide the place after seeing the details.
