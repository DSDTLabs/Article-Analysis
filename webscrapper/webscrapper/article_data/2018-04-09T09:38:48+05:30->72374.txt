GOLD COAST:  's dream crash-landed in a matter of seconds in men's rings final in gymnastics on Sunday as he messed up his dismount and thudded down on the mat straight on his back. The Indian who went into the medal round with high hopes returned empty handed.

 
 
 
 
 That mistake in the final few seconds, of what was otherwise an impressive routine, with a couple of handstands and giant swings, crushed Rakesh's hopes as he tallied only 12.933 points and finished eighth.
 
 "I lost 1.300 points because of the (crash) landing. The mistake in the preparation for landing lost me 0.3 points and another one point for the fall," Patra told TOI in the mixed zone. Had he repeated his score from the first round, Patra would have tallied 13.950 and he would have emerged in the medal range.
 
 
 
 
 Asked the last time, he made a similar landing in a competition, Patra said. "This is the first time, I'm having a fall. It has never happened before." England's  , who has a move named after him, took the gold with a tally of 14.833 ahead of teammate   (14.400) and   of Canada (14.000).
 
 Patra, who got his berth after moving the court, said he was not sure till the last minute whether he will compete in  . "I had so much pressure in my mind about my trip, preparation and performance. And here we don't even have a coach."
