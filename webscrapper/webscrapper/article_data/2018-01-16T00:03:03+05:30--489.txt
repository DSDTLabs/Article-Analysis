Chennai: A few days after the   made a dramatic disclosure to the Madras high court on finding a letter it sent to the chief secretary on the  , in V K Sasikala’s room in Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden bungalow, political parties stepped up their demand for a   probe. 

 Former Union minister and PMK MP   said despite the government stating that there was no gutka sale in the state, the banned product continued to be sold in shops. 
 
 “After the income tax searches in various places, gutka sales came down but even then, it was available in some shops at a high cost. Now after a year or so, it is available very easily. There should be a CBI probe into the entire issue, including the bribe given to various persons in the government,” said Anbumani in a statement. 
 
 On one side, government is opening liquor shops and on the other, gutka and other banned items are easily available. “The government has to take steps to ban both for the sake of the people,” said Anbumani. 
 
 On Friday last, DMK working president M K   wanted the government to drop state health minister C Vijayabaskar from the cabinet as well as DGP T K Rajendran from the job. He tried to raise the issue in the assembly but was not permitted by speaker P Dhanapal. 
 
 After walking out in protest, Stalin said, “It is clear now that the health minister must be dropped from the cabinet and the DGP removed from his post.” 
 
 The original file of former DGP Ashok Kumar has been found in former chief minister’s residence, he said. “The then Chennai police commissioner has been given a promotion as DGP. Both the minister and DGP must be removed,” said Stalin. 
 
 CPI, CPM and other parties have sought a CBI probe into the gutka issue soon after the I-T department presented an affidavit in the high court.
