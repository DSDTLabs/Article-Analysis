The trailer of '  — Dost Se Zyada, Girlfriend Se Kam', which is based on Chetan Bhagat’s novel 'Half Girlfriend', releases today. The film that opens in cinemas on May 19, is a love story that seamlessly shuttles between busy Delhi, rural Bihar and trendy New York. The soundtrack has been carefully crafted, keeping the distinct identities of the cities in mind to ensure the audience experiences the variety these locations add to Madhav ( ) and Riya’s ( ) journey. Even their looks have been designed focussing on the cities they are in.

  
  
 Director   elaborates, “The backdrops form an essential part of the story and play a pivotal role in shaping the destinies of the star-crossed lovers.” Chetan, who is also producing the film along with Mohit and Balaji Motion Pictures, adds, “This is a story about unconditional love that begins in India’s heartland, travels to its metropolis and culminates at the aspirational.”
