KOCHI: The demand to reconstitute Kerala   Regulatory Authority ( ) gains momentum as the state government has decided to repeal the   (Development and Regulation) Act 2015. 

 The apartment owners’ apex association (AOAA) has demanded to avoid delay in constituting the authority as per the Real Estate Act 2016 enacted by the Centre. It is learnt that the state government has taken a decision on March 1 to repeal the state act. 
 
 “There is so much of uncertainty over the reconstitution of the authority. As of now, there is no system to monitor new projects announced by builders or developments in the real estate sector. If the government does not act fast it would adversely affect people who invest their money in various apartment projects,” said C S Vinod, working president of AOAA.
 
 Law secretary B G Harindranath said whether the state act was repealed or not the central act would prevail. “The present KRERA cannot function as it is not constituted in accordance with the central act. Repealing the state act is just a technical procedure,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, KRERA chairman S   said that though they came to know about the state government’s decision to repeal the act through news reports, “they haven’t received any official communication regarding it.”
 
 He also said that the existing authority did not start registration of new apartment projects. “In October 2016, we submitted draft rules based on the central act. However, as the draft rules were still under the consideration of the government, we couldn’t start the registration process,” he said.
 
 Ajaykumar said that due to uncertainty and lack of clarity in the issue it would not be possible to stop builders from announcing new projects.
