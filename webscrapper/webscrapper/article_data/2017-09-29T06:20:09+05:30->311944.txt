MOHALI:   district has achieved top ranking in the national ranking survey conducted by the government under   and Swasth Bharat Mission for achieving 100% target of making rural area open defecation free (ODF).

 Mohali deputy commissioner Gurpreet Kaur   said the administration got 13,784 toilets constructed in 349 villages to secure the ODF status.
 
 Sapra said, “It is good news, Mohali has become the first district of   having individual household toilets in each house."
 
 She said public opinion is being created in villages by organising gram sabhas and social gatherings before constructing toilets, which resulted in scheme adoption by villagers and helped in constituting a clean environment in villages.

  “Soon target for making urban area ODF will be achieved.“ She said.
