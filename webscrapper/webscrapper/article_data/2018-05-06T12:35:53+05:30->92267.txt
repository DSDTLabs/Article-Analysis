AGARTALA: Serious differences between   and IPFT, its partner in the state government, have created tension in mixed population areas across the state in the last few days.   workers have staged demonstrations against the government in many places, giving rise to tension among supporters of the coalition in hill areas of the state. 

 As many as 11 incidents of violence between BJP and IPFT supporters have been reported from Khowai, Jirania, Korbok and Shantirbazar subdivisions in the last two weeks. According to reports, tribal supporters of BJP in places where IPFT is strong have been asked to join the tribal party. Reports also say IPFT supporters have been forcefully collecting funds from people.
 
 On Saturday, IPFT supporters staged a rally and set up a road blockade at Karbook, demanding the release of arrested IPFT workers who were allegedly involved in attacking BJP MLA Burba Mohan Tripura. The protesters demanded that the case registered by the MLA against 35 IPFT workers be withdrawn. Three days ago, IPFT supporters set up a blockade on the alternative highway at Fatikroy in Unokoti district, accusing the local BJP MLA of playing a partisan role.
 
 According to BJP, as many as 13 of their supporters were assaulted by IPFT last week in Korbok, including Korbok Bairagi Bazar Sakhti Kendra president Ranjit Dewan, for refusing to join their party. Dewan told media, "There was no personal enmity, only political reasons. IPFT supporters had asked me why I was supporting BJP and they asked me to join IPFT but I refused. On the next day, they attacked my house and beat me seriously."
 
 Manaranjan Debbarma, former  , said, "Non-tribal traders who support BJP have stopped attending rural markets in autonomous district council areas. Deputy CM Jishnu Dev Varma and IPFT chief   have visited a few locations but the situation has not improved."
