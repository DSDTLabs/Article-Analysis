MUMBAI: The largest and oldest Indian private   house,  , has raised $610 million for its seventh fund taking its assets under management to about $3.2 billion.

 The just completed fund raising was supported by several of ChrysCapital’s long-standing limited partners or LPs such as GIC, Asia-Alternatives and the  , as well as new marquee investors in funds which included global insurance companies, university endowments and family offices. LPs are institutions, family offices and individuals who participate as investors in funds.
 
 Despite a tough fund raising environment for the Indian private equity industry, ChrysCapital’s latest mop up took just over a year, Gaurav Ahuja, ChrysCapital's MD said. This was a testament to the firm’s strong track record of generating good returns and realisations in a market where both have been elusive, he said.
  
 ChrysCapital's latest fund will continue to pursue the firm’s strategy of investing in minority growth and select control opportunities across its key focus sectors – business services, financial services, pharmaceuticals/healthcare, consumer and manufacturing. It as already made two investments from this fund – the first in L&T Infotech, part of the industrial conglomerate L&T Group and India’s largest mid-tier IT services company, and in Hero FinCorp, the consumer finance arm of Hero MotoCorp.
  
 ChrysCapital has executed a rather smooth founder transition after Ashish Dhawan moved on around five years ago. The current team of four partners, led by Managing Partner Kunal Shroff, is credited for the successful closure of its two prior funds, ChrysCapital III and IV, since the founder transition. The other 3 partners are Sanjiv Kaul, Sanjay Kukreja and Ashley Menezes.
 
 The team is in the process of monetizing the last few remaining investments from ChrysCapital V and expects to wrap up the fund during the first half of 2017. This will make ChrysCapital the only Indian private equity firm with five fully realized funds -- and its $4.5 billion of realizations would represent a large piece of the Indian private equity industry’s total realizations.
