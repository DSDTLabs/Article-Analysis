VISAKHAPATNAM: To ensure the port city paints a picture of tranquility on the eve of CII-sponsored two-day partnership summit scheduled for Friday, the TDP government mobilized its might to foil the candlelight march, demanding special category status (SCS) for Andhra Pradesh on RK Beach. 

 While emotions ran high, Union minister of state for science and technology Y Sujana Chowdary stoked controversy with his comments on the candlelight march. 
 
 Asked about protests planned on Republic Day by a few parties in Vizag and elsewhere, Chowdary said: "I don't understand how Jallikattu protests became an inspiration to these people. If they are really fond of Jallikattu, let them go and play the game. They are free to take part in cock fights too. If not satisfied, they can go and take part in pig fights competitions," said a visibly angry Chowdary. He went on to challenge supporters of special category status to prove how it would help Andhra Pradesh. His comments drew sharp criticism from Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan and others.
 
 In Vizag alone, scores of protesters who tried to converge on Beach Road were arrested at various points. YSR Congress president Jaganmohan Reddy, who landed at Vizag airport around 4 pm, was not banned entry, following which he staged a sit-in on the tarmac along with party leaders before he was shifted to the VIP Lounge. Jagan was later convinced to leave the city and he boarded the Air India flight to Hyderabad at 6 pm.
 
 Besides Vizag, a candelight march was planned in Vijayawada and Tirupati, but these too were thwarted. In Kakinada, JNTU students who wanted to join protests were lathicharged on the campus.
