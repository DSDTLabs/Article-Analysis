DUBAI: A Christian businessman from   has gifted a $3 lakh (1.3 million dirham) mosque to hundreds of Muslim workers in the   ahead of Ramzan, a media report said on Wednesday.
 
 
 Saji  , 49, built the mosque for the workers living in a worker accommodation that he rented out to 53 companies in Fujairah. He will name the mosque as Mariam, Umm   (Mary, the Mother of Jesus).
 
 Cheriyan said he decided to build the mosque after he saw workers taking taxis to go to the nearest mosque. The businessman had landed in the UAE in 2003 with just a few hundred dirhams. The mosque in the   complex in Al Hayl Industrial Area can accommodate 250 worshippers at a time.
 
 “Officials were surprised and happy when they got to know I am a Christian who wishes to build a mosque. They offered me all support and were ready to offer free electricity and water and other facilities,” Cheriyan said. However, all that he has accepted from them are a carpet and the sound system for the mosque.
 
 “When word spread about my mosque, many offered help. But I have politely refused since I wanted to build the mosque on my own,” he said.
 
 
 He said he has opted for the name Mariam, Umm Eisa for the mosque after an Abu Dhabi mosque was renamed so in 2017.
 
 
 Cheriyan, an Orthodox Christian by birth, had previously built a church for his parish in   and also keeps the doors of a multipurpose hall in the   for various other groups of Christian believers to pray.
