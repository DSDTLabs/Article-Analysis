VADODARA: In a first of its kind move, the elected wing of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) has raised the issue of illegal drainage and water connections made into its lines with the   ( ). 

 Mayor Bharat Dangar has shot a letter to VUDA stating that realty projects in its area were without infrastructure and eating into those of VMC.
 
 Dangar not only shot the letter to VUDA, but also sent it to the state urban development department. The mayor raised the issue regarding the projects on the Atladara-Bil Road, but the condition in several other areas under VUDA is no different.
 
 According to the letter, around 25 to 30 residential and commercial projects had come up on the Atladara-Bil Road. Dangar has pointed out that these projects did not have basic amenities and questioned how they were given occupation and completion certificates.
 
 The mayor has claimed that the realtors had made illegal connections into VMC’s drainage and water lines. The letter alleges that the builder were claiming that this had been done at the instance of VUDA officials. “If the officials have given such instructions, action should be taken against them. If they have not done so, action should be taken against the builders,” said Dangar.
 
 Dangar pointed out that the residents of VUDA and VMC areas had to suffer due to the lack of supervision by VUDA officials. Due to the illegal connections, issues of water supply pressure and overflowing drainages kept cropping up in VMC areas.
 
 The letter demands that VUDA should get all sites in its area checked. If this revealed that the sites did not have proper facilities, their completion certificates should be cancelled and action should be taken against the developers, it adds.
