MUMBAI: The   refused permission to a 52-year-old woman to break the fixed deposit meant for her child who has   in order to buy a house. 

 A division bench of Justice Rajendra Savant and Justice Sandeep Shinde pointed out that the money was deposited on the orders of the court by her former husband as security for the future of their child, who is now 25 years old.
 
 "The overarching reason as can be seen from the order (of the family court rejecting the woman's plea) is the ground that the amount of Rs 50 lakh and the interest accruing thereof is to be utilised to take care of the child, including her security. The trial court also took note of the fact that the child is now in college but is still suffering from Down Syndrome as per the report obtained from the JJ Group of Hospitals," said the judges, adding, "we do not find any reason to take a different view from that of the family court."
 
 The woman and the child live in Mumbai, while her former husband who is 58 years old, lives in Madurai. 
 
 The couple had obtained a divorce in 2007. The family court ordered the man to deposit Rs 50 lakh by way of permanent alimony to take care of the child and also directed him to pay Rs 20,000 per month. The amount was to be deposited in the name of the child. The man had recently stopped paying monthly maintenance on the grounds that the daughter was now an adult. Litigation with regard to the monthly maintenance is pending before high court.
 
 The woman, meanwhile, filed an application before the family court, urging it to break the fixed deposit and release around Rs 6 lakh to pay a builder, who is constructing a multi-storey luxury residential towers project in Chembur. 
 
 She said the flat would be bought in the names of her daughter and herself. Advocate Jalaja Nambiar, counsel for the husband, pointed to the family court order, which had said the money was to be used for the care of the daughter and was to be deposited in her name.
