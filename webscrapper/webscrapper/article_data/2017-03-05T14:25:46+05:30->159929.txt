Actor   says playing the first ever transparently gay character in a   movie is incredible. 

 The 36-year-old actor takes on the role of LeFou in the live-action remake of 'Beauty and the  '. 
 
  
  
 Speaking at the world premiere of the movie in Los Angeles, Josh says, "(Director)   did an amazing job of giving us an opportunity to create a version of LeFou that isn't like the original, that expands on what the original did, but that makes him more human and makes him a wonderfully complex character to some extent. It's an incredible moment and it's subtle, but I think it's effective."
