Guwahati: Senior   leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday dismissed the notion that Congress gave up in Tripura and Nagaland even before the battle, saying that the Grand Old Party focussed its energies on its stronghold Meghalaya. 

 "I would say that we have not given up, but our organization has been traditionally weak in Nagaland and Tripura," said Azad, who was here after campaigning in Shillong. Fighting to retain power in Meghalaya, Congress has been reduced to a point of near-oblivion in Tripura and Nagaland. In the last two years, Congress lost Assam and Manipur to BJP. In Arunachal Pradesh, BJP took over from Congress through a coup. Mizoram, which is going to polls by the year-end, is the only other state under Congress.
 
 Azad said Congress is directing all its efforts at protecting the states where it has a strong organization. "In Meghalaya, we are in power and our organization is also very strong there, like in Assam and Mizoram. We are trying to save the state where we have a strong organization," he added.
 
 The worst scene is in Nagaland, where Congress has failed to put up its candidates in not even half of the total seats of 60. After five of its candidates withdrew, the party is left with just 18 of its men in the fray. The party has tasted power in the state thrice in the past - from 1986 to 1988, 1989 to 1990 and from 1993 to 2003.
 
 The party may have fielded 56 candidates for the 60-member Tripura assembly, but it was a less than half-hearted effort to fight BJP, which has replaced it as the main challenger to the Left in the state. It also formed the government in Tripura thrice in the past - from 1963 to 1971, 1972 to 1977 and 1988 to 1993.
 
 The only silver lining in Congress's dark horizon is Meghalaya, where its challenger is not its arch rival BJP but a regional force, National People's Party, formed five years ago by its former veteran leader from the region, PA Sangma. Congress is fighting from 57 of the 60 seats here.
 
 The party's electoral fortunes in the state has seen the maximum number of ups and downs in Meghalaya. For seven times, including the current one, Congress has ruled the Christian-majority hill state, 1976-1978, 1981-1990, 1992-1998, 2003-till date.
