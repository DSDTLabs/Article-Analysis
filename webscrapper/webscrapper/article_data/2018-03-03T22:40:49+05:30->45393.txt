NEW DELHI:   president   on Saturday took a veiled dig at   president   who is currently in Italy, saying that elections are ongoing in the European country.

 
 "Mujhe WhatsApp pe message aaya hai ki Italy mein chunaav hai (I received a message on WhatsApp that elections are currently on in Italy)," said 
  a press conference on his party's performance in the Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya elections.
 
  
  
 Union minister Giriraj Singh, too, today declared Gandhi a "master election strategist" - purportedly for leaving the country at a time when election results in three states were due.
 
 "Rahul Gandhi is a master election strategist..he knows when to run away from India now," he had said.
 
 Congress leader Ahmed Patel hit out at Singh, demanding to know if it was a "crime for someone to visit his own grandmother."
 
 "Absolutely baseless. Is it a crime for someone to visit his own grandmother? It has become a profession for him to make unnecessary comments," he said.
 
 Earlier this week, Gandhi jetted off to Italy to spend the Holi weekend with his 93-year-old 'nani', or maternal grandmother.
 
 "My Nani is 93. She's the kindest soul ever. This Holi weekend, I'm going to surprise her! I can't wait to give her a hug... Happy Holi to all of you. Have a joyful celebration," he announced on Twitter on Thursday.
 
  
  
 
 The results of the election in the northeastern state of Tripura today gave a big leg-up to the BJP, which dislodged the 25-year rule of the Left Front in the state, easily crossing the half-way mark with over 40 seats in the 60-seat Assembly.
 
 In Nagaland, the BJP showcased its strength, moving toward the half-way mark all on its own, while trends in Meghalaya indicate a hung Assembly.
