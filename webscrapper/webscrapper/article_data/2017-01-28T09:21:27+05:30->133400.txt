KOLHAPUR: Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) plan to win the upcoming   and civic elections received a major jolt on Thursday after its long-term ally Shiv Sena decided not to form an alliance with them and go solo.

 Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray announced that his party will not go with the BJP in the local body elections. The Sena has control over six legislative assembly constituencies in the district and if it had aligned with the BJP, the alliance would have had good chances of winning the elections. Currently, the ZP is under the control of Congress and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna.
 
 Now, Sena MLAs will not help BJP anymore and the votes will be divided giving an edge to the Congress and Nationalist   (NCP). The Sena leaders claimed that the BJP has always humiliated its local leaders for their ambition to grow in the district.
 
 “Our party has the largest strength in the district as we have six MLAs. The decision by our party chief will help us winning most of the seats we are contesting on,” said a senior Sena leader.
 
 Sena has six members in the ZP and now the number may go up. The Congress has kept the option of post-poll alliance with Sena if it falls short of majority. The BJP has begun the process to shortlist its candidates and has not invited Sena for any of its meetings.
 
 The BJP has aligned with Tararani Aghadi in Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) and Nagarpalika elections and distanced itself from Shiv Sena. It has also joined hands with former minister Vinay Kore’s Jan Surajya Shakti party and is going to contest on over 40 seats.
 
 Baba Desai, Sanghatan Mantri of the BJP, said, “Sena’s decision will not affect our prospectus. We have built the organisation in most parts of the district. The MLAs elected on Sena’s ticket were imported from other parties. We have strong candidates for the ZP election. Also, other outfits such as Republican Party of India (RPI) and Shetkari Sanghatana too have joined us.”
