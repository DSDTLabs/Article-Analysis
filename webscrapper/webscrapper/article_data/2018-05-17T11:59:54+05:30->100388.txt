BENGALURU: Due to poor infrastructure, unfulfilled promises from the previous assembly election and no change in the aam aadmi’s quality of life, around 5% voters from Bengaluru South constituency opted for None of The Above ( ) option.

 As per the  , of 3,31,348 people who voted in Bengaluru South constituency, 15,829 (4.8%) pressed the NOTA button.
 
 “Be it Congress, BJP or JD(S), the fate of the common man will never change. It’s a miracle the administration wheel is turning. Look at the roads and other basic amenities;   and its staff turn a deaf to our problem. Why should we vote?” said   BP, a private company employee from Uttarahalli which comes under Benglauru South.
 
 Sandeep said his friends in other parts of the city too opted for NOTA. “My colleague stays in   in North Bengaluru. Last year, the   carried out mass demolition work and razed illegal constructions, in particular structures built on the raja kaluve. However, some structures owned by cine stars and influential persons remained untouched. Upset at this bias, my colleague and his family opted for NOTA,” he said.
 
 Sreelatha Rajesh, a resident from Mahadevapura, said she opted for NOTA to register her protest against corruption. “Our roads were in terrible condition. BBMP records show they were asphalted a couple of times between 2014 and 2017. It means hundreds of crores of rupees have been swindled,” she said.
 
 Subrato B, a native of West Bengal and resident of Malleswaram, said it’s better to opt for NOTA. “I have my reasons to oppose the present political system. Corruption in different forms have ruined democracy. I have no interest in voting. But if don’t vote, my vote will be misused. So I opted for NOTA,” he said.
