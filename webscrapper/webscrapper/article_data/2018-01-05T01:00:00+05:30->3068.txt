' ' writer  , who makes his directorial debut with ' ', is thrilled to have roped in an impressive line-up of actors for the film. Starring  ,  ,  ,  , Kunaal Roy Kapur, Akshay Oberoi, Shenaz Treasury, Shivam Patil, Amyra Dastur, and Neil Bhoopalam, the dark comedy has woven in multiple stories that take place in the course of one night — from sundown to sunrise. The film revolves around six characters from Mumbai’s three parallel worlds — the urban, the upwardly mobile and the dark, neglected underbelly. 
“The   with an   cast starts with writing — you’re juggling many characters and trying to make them distinct and three-dimensional. For example, when you’re writing a comedy, it’s tough to give each character a distinct flavour and not make them all sound the same,” says the writer-director, adding, “it was challenging and interesting to translate them to the screen because we were making three movies in one. The demands of each story were different. So, though your crew is the same, you’re dealing with different actors, who have their own pace and rhythm. Some actors hit the ground running and are burnt out by the fourth or the fifth take. Meanwhile, others take two or three takes to warm up and they get better with every take.” 
 'Kaalakaandi', produced by Cinestaan Film Company and Flying Unicorn Entertainment, releases on January 12.
