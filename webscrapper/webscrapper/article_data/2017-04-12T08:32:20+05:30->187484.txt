BENGALURU: The   on Tuesday questioned the   for the   (ACB) in Karnataka. 

  "This (ACB) is not akin to the Lokayukta. How it is constituted? Everything was fine under the Lokayukta. Why was this (agency) constituted?" Justice   asked while hearing a petition filed by  , chief engineer of BBMP. The petition challenged the FIR registered by the ACB against him under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988. 
 
  The petitioner's counsel claimed the ACB was formed after an executive order was issued and the agency directly comes under the chief minister and chief secretary. The government had passed an executive order on March 14, 2016 for forming the ACB. 
 
 ACB counsel, however, claimed that it has powers to investigate these cases.
 
 The court stayed proceedings against Nagaraj and also Gayathri N Nayak, a special land acquisition officer (national highways), working in Mangaluru. It ordered notice to the government and ACB on Gayathri's plea challenging the constitutional validity of the bureau. Gayathri urged the court to quash the FIR registered against her in a bribery case.
 
  "In Karnataka, the procedure for investigation into offences under the PC Act is prescribed by the Lokayukta Act. Thus, the field is occupied by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Police Act, 1963 and the Karnataka Lokayukta Act, 1984. When the field is occupied by legislation, it is impermissible to invoke Article 162 by the executive," the petitioner claimed.
