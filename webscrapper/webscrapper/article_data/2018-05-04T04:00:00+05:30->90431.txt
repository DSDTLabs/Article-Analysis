Surat: The standing committee of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) on Thursday decided to hear in person all the people of Surat Textile Market (STM) and Experimental School,   

 Standing committee chairman Rajesh Desai told TOI, “Members of STM committee had written to us requesting that they be heard personally before we took any decision under the Land Disposal Act, 2002. We have decided to meet them in person before fixing new rent or outright sale price for the land.” 
 
 Some of the residents of Umra village, who are set to lose either their land or house because of construction of Pal-Umra bridge, have agreed to municipal commissioner’s proposal to accept a plot measuring 1,200 sq metre to build a new house besides compensation. However, a few are still reluctant and hence the standing committee has decided to meet all the 22 affected families this week. “We hope this problem would be solved once the standing committee meets the affected people,” Desai said. 
 
 The standing committee has given one final chance to the management of Experimental School to make a presentation before it. “The members of the management would be meeting us for one final time before we take a final decision on the issue,” Desai added.
 
 Meanwhile, the standing committee rejected the proposal to let footpath space for a food plaza in Bhatar. The standing committee members felt that it would set a bad precedent.
