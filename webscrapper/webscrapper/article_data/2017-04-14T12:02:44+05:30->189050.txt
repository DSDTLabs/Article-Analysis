 Bidhan Biswas, a middle-aged IT professional who lives at Kalyaninagar with his family, is one of them. "April 15 is Poila Boisakh or New Year's Day for Bengalis. We wanted to fly to Kolkata to be with my parents but the price of a one-way ticket on most airlines now is nothing less than Rs 15,000. The cost is forbidding as we are a family of three. My parents had reminded me of the date last month itself. I should have planned in advance when the fares were cheaper," he told TOI.
 
 The ongoing week has Baisakhi, Vishu, Poila Boisakh and Easter. While Baisakhi and Vishu fall on April 14, Poila Boisakh is on April 15 and Easter on April 16. 
 
 Ravi Menon, another working professional from Kerala, also lamented the high air fares. "It would not have pinched the pocket much had I been flying alone to Kochi. But we are a family of five. 
 
 The   never really went down and hovered around Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000. Tickets were priced at Rs 6,000 on Thursday too, but were set to go up by Rs 1,000 on Friday. It would cost our family almost Rs 60,000 for a round trip. That's big money for me," he said.
