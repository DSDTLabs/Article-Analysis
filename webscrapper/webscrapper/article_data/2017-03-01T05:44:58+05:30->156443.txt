INDORE: A large number of cattle-owners led by   and supported by the Yadav community approached the district collector against what they called ‘injustice’ by   (IMC) to raze down their houses.

 “We condemn murder of IMC worker, Shubham Kushwaha in a fight with a cattle-owner. We are also in favor of sending the animals outside the city limit but it does not mean that   of cattle-owners should be razed down,” said Patwari.
 
 He added that the list to raze down cow-sheds and other structures of the cattle-owners prepared by IMC not only has names of those, who have left the business years ago but also has names of those, who had passed away.
 
 “We support IMC and the administration to free the city from stray animals and the ongoing drive to demolish cow-sheds and other illegal structures of the cattle-owners but no legal structures should be razed down,” the MLA said.
 
 He added that many residential structures owned by cattle-owners that have been marked by IMC will affect other members of the family, who are not involved in the business.
 
 To this, IMC commissioner Manish Singh was called in to put their side on the matter.
 
 After hearing the cattle-owners and Congress leaders, the collector and IMC commissioner said that illegal structures will not be spared at any cost. They also made it clear that hooliganism will not be tolerated.
