GHAZIABAD: At least two persons were injured when a tanker filled with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) ploughed into a house on the   in Ghaziabad late on Monday night. The tanker was on its way to Varanasi after refilling at the   plant in Loni.

 Apart from the driver, Akhilesh Kumar, a person who stays in the house on rent was also injured. He has been identified by police as Sandeep. Both Akhilesh and Sandeep have been admitted to a government hospital in Loni where their health condition is stated to be stable.
 
 The house into which the tanker crashed is located to the left of the main road connecting the Bhopura T-point with the Tila Shahbazpur T-point, which leads to Loni. The accident took place around 1:30am and the tanker was moving on the wrong side of the road.
 
 Police said things could have been worse had the tanker exploded under the impact. “A portion of the other carriageway along this stretch is closed at present because of repairs. The tanker was driving through the wrong carriageway.

 The walls of the house, which belongs to one Dinesh Kasana of Bhopura, have been damaged . The tanker is owned by a transporter from Varanasi, Ravi Singh.
