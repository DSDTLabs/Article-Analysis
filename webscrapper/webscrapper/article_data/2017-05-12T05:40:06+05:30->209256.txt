NAGPUR:  , after the Sukma massacre, it seems, are trying to draw sympathy of the locals and boost their image among the masses by speaking about the “poor condition” of jawans in the conflict zone and criticising the policies of the central and Chhattisgarh governments.

 According to a leaflet recovered on May 5 from Dandakaranya region in the central Indian plateau, the   said that the   and other forces were being subjected to “cruelty by their capitalist and corporate masters” for their own vested interest of “plundering” the natural resources in the region. They also claimed that the poor jawans were “dying in the conflict zone” for the “corporate houses”.
 
 The two-page leaflet further said, “Had the 25 CRPF jawans surrendered, we would not have eliminated them.” The naxalites had asked them to surrender but the jawans preferred to fight, the pamphlet said and claimed to have “seized” substantial arms and ammunition from the security personnel.
 
 The naxalites also refuted the charges of kidnapping seven CRPF jawans, and said that allegations levelled against them by the government are false. They also protested against the “government propaganda” for having mutilated the bodies of the jawans. Giving the reasons behind the Sukma attack, the Naxals said they wanted to avenge the policies of the Centre and the state’s Opertion Green Hunt, which has been launched to crush the “mass movement”.
 
 The leaflet, issued by South Bastar divisional committee of banned   of India (Maoist), also said that the rebels had lost two of their most experienced commanders in the Burkapal conflict. The leaflet ends with a nostalgic note, relaying information about 24 PL commander Anil, alias Deva, and Cherla local organisational squad member Ravi, a native of Telangana, labelling them as “martyrs”.
