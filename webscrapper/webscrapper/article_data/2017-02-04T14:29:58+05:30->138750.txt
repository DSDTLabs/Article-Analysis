NASHIK: The city police have prepared a list of 33   that they suspect would cause trouble during the   scheduled for February 21. 

 The list will be sent to senior officials of the city police who will take a final call on their externment. "The police are geared up in case anyone tires to disturb the peaceful environment of the city," a senior police officer said on Friday.
 
 Police sources said the procedure of externing someone from a district has to be done within   and a hearing is conducted after a notice is served. Only after then the process is carried out. "It is now in the final phase," the officer said.
 
 "By the time campaigning starts, we will ensure that check posts will be in place at all entry and exit points of Nashik and even in the interiors," the officer said.
 
 When asked about the clash between two factions of Sena workers, the police said it was an internal matter and the police was there to ensure law and order situation. "If any complaint is lodged with us we will definitely look into it," the officer said.
 
 Officials said they will keep a watch over money being distributed among people or candidates being kidnapped, weapons and externed criminals sneaking back into the city for illegal activities.
 
 In view of such things, the check nakas at the entry and exit points will be needed. The police said they were also planning bandobast, but were awaiting announcement of sensitive and non-sensitive wards. Once the sensitive wards are declared, the bandobast will be planned accordingly.
 
 Officials also said they may get additional force from outside the city, apart from teams of  .
