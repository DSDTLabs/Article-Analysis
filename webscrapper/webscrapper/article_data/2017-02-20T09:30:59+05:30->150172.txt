NEW DELHI: Even though registration of crimes against women dipped marginally in 2016, Delhi reported six rapes on an average every day, indicating that much more was needed to be done to bring the numbers further down.

 In 2017, the numbers have dipped further. Delhi Police registered 140   cases in January. Last year, the figure was 147 by January end.
 
 Delhi Police officers said that the dip in crime rates is the result of proactive policing measures. “We conducted street plays, self-defence programmes and awareness campaigns over the course of the year,” said a senior officer.
 
 According to police data, 96.4% of the accused in rape cases were known to the victims. Overall, Delhi Police registered 2,155 cases of rape in 2016 as against 2,199 registered in 2015.
 
 In the annual review of the cases of crime against women, police said that of all rape and   cases registered, 85.09% of rape and 70.60% of molestation were solved within 48 hours. The chargesheets in these cases were also filed within 20 days.
 
 During the crime mapping exercises conducted last year, police found that almost 95% of cases of crime against women were reported from JJ clusters, resettlement colonies and areas where civic amenities were poor.
 
 In 2016,   registered 4,166 cases of molestation as against the 5,367 registered in 2015. 3,033 cases of molestation were solved in 2016. This year, 238 cases of molestation have been registered so far.
 
 According to the data, cases of abduction of women too witnessed a significant reduction. In 2015, 556 cases of abduction were registered, while 444 cases were reported in 2016.
