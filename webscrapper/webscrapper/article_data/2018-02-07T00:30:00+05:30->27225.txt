Madurai: The move by the additional first court III to attach 18 official vehicles including that of Madurai collector K Veera Raghava Rao, revenue and PWD (public works department) officer for failure to pay compensation to two families for the land acquired from them was dropped after the officers assured the petitioners that they would be paid their dues in a month.

 Nearly one acre of land was acquired from A Adaikann and T Kannan of Perungudi in 2004, for carrying out works in the Nilaiyur channel. While Adaikan and a family member had given 69.16 cents, two more people including Kannan had given 30 cents for the work. As they were given less than Rs 300 for each cent, they went to court seeking compensation.
 
 In 2011, the court directed that the petitioners be paid Rs 18 per square feet, which worked out to about Rs 22.42 lakh. Kannan had to be given Rs 9.19 lakh as compensation for the land he had given. When the case came up for hearing last December, the court ordered the bailiffs to attach the vehicles including those of the collector, DRO and RDO. However, the move was dropped after senior officials assured them that the compensation would be paid by February 28.
