RAJKOT: He may have physical deformity since birth, but that did not deter him from dreaming big. On Monday, Devang Dabhi (16) inched closer to his goal of becoming an engineer as he secured 96 percentile in SSC board exam. Though he was born without a left arm, he will be opting for science stream to fulfil his dream.

 
 It was jubilation time at   on   main road, a small locality of lower middle-class families. Devang’s father   and mother Parul knew their son was bright, but had never imagined that he would pass board exams with such flying colours. Devang was always a bright student securing good marks in exams. 
 
 His father works at a tractor garage on Ahmedabad highway, while mother is a homemaker. Both of them have not completed their schooling. 
 
 Devang has two elder sisters, one of them is married while the other, Hiral, who has become his inspiration, is working at a private firm. 
 
 “My sister (Hiral) has always been my inspiration. She used to pick and drop me from school,” he said. Talking about the secret behind his success, Devang said, “I worked hard and used to read early in the morning and strictly followed my teachers’ instructions. I want to become an engineer. That is my dream.” 
 
 Devang’s mother Parul could hardly contain her feelings. “We came to know that our son has a spark and I am confident that one day he will earn a big name. We will do all that we can to fulfil his dream,” said Parul.
 
 His school principal   said that Devang didn’t lose his confidence ever. “He has been studying in our school since class VIII. He doesn’t have left arm, but I have never seen him under stress. I am very proud of him,” said Desai.
