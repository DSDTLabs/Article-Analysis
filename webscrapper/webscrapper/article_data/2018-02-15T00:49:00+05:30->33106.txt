Madurai: Seeking to set aside the notice sent to him by the Madurai Corporation enhancing the rent of shops leased out to him, former Union minister M K Alagiri has filed a case before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court.

 The Madurai Corporation has leased out its shops situated in many places in Madurai. It is issuing notice to the licencees who have taken the shops by enhancing the rent. 
 
 In his petition, the former minister said he has taken on lease three shops in Periyar Complex in the city and is paying Rs 10,565 each as rent. The corporation sent a notice to him saying that the rent has been enhanced to Rs 13,358, failing which it would auction the shops and allot them to a successful bidder. 
 
 As per the municipal administration and water supply departmentâ€™s government order, the lease of the shop could be extended by enhancing the rent to 15% for three years and may be handed over the same allottee. However, the corporation is taking steps contrary to the government order. Besides, it said that based on the market value, value of building and land the rent has been fixed. But, it failed to consider the depreciation of the buildings. Justice V Bharathidasan adjourned the case by a week to pass an order on it.
