PANAJI: The state government has decided to file a review petition regarding the Supreme Court’s order quashing the second renewal of 88   leases in Goa. Chief minister  , who is undergoing treatment in the US, has given a go-ahead to file the review petition, a senior official said, adding that it would likely be filed after Friday.

 The government has decided to approach the apex court over closure of mining operations even as senior counsel Harish Salve had advised that it had “no chance” of obtaining a favourable verdict if it filed a review petition.
 
 Mining industry stakeholders are keen that the government take an initiative in the matter to salvage the industry. The   had told TOI a week ago that it would file a review plea, but that it was waiting for the chief minister’s decision. 
 
 A month ago, a three-member cabinet advisory committee (CAC), had recommended that the government file a review petition against the stoppage of mining even as the advocate general of Goa had said there was no other option before the state government than the auction route.
