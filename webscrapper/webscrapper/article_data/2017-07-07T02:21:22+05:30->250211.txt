MUMBAI: The cash-starved   government will utilise the Chief Minister’s   Fund to partially fulfil its promise of a Rs 34,022-crore loan waiver for farmers.

 An order issued by the general administration department on Thursday said that the government would dip into the CM’s relief   to reduce the burden put on the exchequer by the unprecedented write-off of agrarian loans.
 
 The   government had set up the fund on March 2, 1967 to provide monetary and material aid to victims of natural calamities. In addition, there is a separate fund to provide medical assistance to needy patients. On June 28, the trust headed by the   widened the terms of reference and added an 11th objective—financing the farmers’ loan waiver.
 
 An RTI query in May this year had elicited the information that the CM’s relief fund held deposits of Rs 574 crore, which attracted an interest of over Rs 40 crore.
 
 On June 24, Fadnavis had declared that the state would write off loans amounting to over Rs 32,000 crore to provide relief to 89 lakh farmers. On June 28, the finance department issued a five-point order to slash revenue expenditure by 30% and capital expenditure by 20%. The order also provided for large-scale austerity measures to garner funds for the loan waiver scheme. “We expect to mobilise Rs 15,000 crore by imposing these cuts. However, we still require an additional nearly Rs 19,000 crore,’’ said a senior bureaucrat.
 
 He added that state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had called on Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and transport minister Nitin Gadkari to draft an action plan for mobilisation of funds, but did not succeed.
 
 The state government has already appealed to elected representatives, bureaucrats and IPS officers to donate at least a day’s salary for the loan waiver scheme.
