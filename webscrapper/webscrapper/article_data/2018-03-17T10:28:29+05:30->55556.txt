Tuesday was a big day for music composer Arindom Chatterjee. 
  had resumed online sale of tickets for World Cup 
  and Arindom didn’t want to miss this window of opportunity. He failed to book berths for the first and second semi-finals despite spending almost the whole day glued to his laptop. On the bright side, he already has tickets to three matches and will be travelling to Saint Petersburg on June 26.
Of course, Arindom is not alone. Many football-crazy 
  have their bags packed and are waiting for June 14, when the soccer extravaganza kicks off in  . Arindom, who is taking his mother to the Argentina-Nigeria match on June 26, told us, “I’m a huge fan of Argentina and can’t get over the team’s defeat in the World Cup 2014 finals. I also have tickets to the quarter-finals on July 6 and 7, and hope to get seats at the semi-finals. Ticket sales will resume shortly and I’m keeping an eye out,” said Arindom, who is leaving Kolkata on June 24 and will return on July 18.
 Arindom’s air tickets are already done and a large group of friends is accompanying him on the trip.
 Musician Upal Sengupta, a football fanatic and a die-hard Brazil fan, is excited about the Fan ID he has already received. He will be attending the Brazil vs Serbia match in Moscow on June 27 and another knockout match on July 1. He is leaving for Moscow on June 24 and will be back on July 2. “It was hard to accept Brazil’s defeat in the last World Cup. They lost to Germany, but this year the team looks good. The squad has Willian, Neymar, Thiago, Marcelo and many other stars. Neymar is the biggest star of Brazilian football at the moment and though his injury has made news, I am hopeful that he will be in peak form. Also, I hope to see 
  in action and will pray that 
  plays the knockout on July 1,” he said. Upal will go with several friends, including Jayjit Lahiri, the lyricist of Tomae dilam and other famous songs.
