Pudukottai: As escalating mercury levels are breaking past records with each passing day, demand for packaged drinking water and beverages is skyrocketing too. However, to ensure that these beverages are safe for drinking, the Pudukottai district administration has been sensitising people on identifying its quality by way of checking the status of the company that manufactures the product. People who purchase packaged drinks can log on to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) website and by entering the ISI or FSSAI numbers mentioned in the product, one can have a look at the past six months record of the company. It provides details about the various laboratory tests that the company does to ensure safety of the drink apart from the date of expiry of its licence and other vital details. “Out of the total 34 units manufacturing packaged drinking water, 33 have already uploaded their laboratory records for the past six months in the FSSAI website,” said R Ramesh Babu, designated officer, Tamil Nadu food safety department in Pudukottai. They have given clear instructions that no packaged drinking water should come without dates of manufacturing and expiry apart from FSSAI and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) number. “If these details are not found on a product then it means it is a duplicate and consumers are requested to send a complaint to 9444042322 via WhatsApp for necessary action to be taken against the company,” said S Ganesh, collector of Pudukottai district. The officials added that all the shops have been instructed to use only purified water and fresh fruits to make juice. The collector has also urged the public to use the same WhatsApp number to lodge a complaint if they come across any violation.
