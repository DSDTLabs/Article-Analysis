Singer Nicole   suffered a wardrobe malfunction while attending the premiere for "Dirty Dancing (2017)" TV reboot here.
 
  The 38-year-old accidentally flashed her underwear as she strolled along the street in a stunning backless dress at the premiere on Thursday, reports aceshowbiz.com.
  
  Scherzinger, who plays   in the TV remake of the iconic 1980s dance film, was spotted wearing a cream floor length dress with a split slashed across the mid-thigh and a plunging neckline.
  
  However, she failed to notice that her risque gown had ridden up, exposing her cream-coloured knickers.
  
  After attending the event, she headed to an after-party at TAO nightclub.
  
  It's not the first time Scherzinger has suffered a wardrobe malfunction. Earlier this year, she flashed her lower back as she bent down to get into a car that was waiting outside the venue of London Fashion Week.
