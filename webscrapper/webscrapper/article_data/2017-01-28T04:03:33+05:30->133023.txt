NEW DELHI: A special court came down hard on an elderly   and her son for peddling drugs. 

 While sentencing the duo to six years in jail and imposing a penalty of Rs 50,000 each, the court observed that that narcotics “corrode the basic structure of society”. These, special judge (NDPS) Deepak Garg said, damage the social fabric by “destabilising families, reducing human productivity and corrupting trustworthy governments”, besides demoralising law-abiding citizens. 
 
 On March 30, 2013, the car of Kamla (61) and her son Jitender was intercepted and around 20.4 kilos of cannabis was found in the boot. The duo was chargesheeted, also for abetment and criminal conspiracy under the NDPS Act. The accused had refuted all charges and alleged that they had been implicated. 
 
 The court, however, found the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses “trustworthy and believable”. Jitender was found driving the car and Kamla was sitting beside him. “In the circumstances, since the prosecution has proved its case… There is no escape from the conclusion that both the accused were in conscious possession of the contraband in question,” it observed.
 
 Special judge Garg also observed that the seized cannabis was ‘borderline’ when it was brought to court, and weighed even less later. So the contraband was adjudged ‘intermediate’. 
 
 Therefore, instead of handing out a punishment meant for commercial quantity, the court convicted Kamla and Jitender under Section 20 (b) II. 
 
 The accused had also asked for leniency: Kamla on the grounds of illness, and Jitender on the grounds of having a disabled teenaged daughter. 
 
 Garg, however, said “No undue sympathy is warranted in the matter.”
