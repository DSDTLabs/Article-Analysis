NASHIK: Members of the   on Monday raised concerns regarding various issues, including the delay in   works that began a   along with   issues.

 Vatsala Khaire, Congress corporator of prabhag 13 (a), said gutters in her prabhag were not cleaned and she had to get it done through a private contractor. “What is the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) for if we have to get work done through private contractors?” Khaire asked.
 
 She added that her prabhag had slums like Kumbharwada, Kazigadi and others in Old Nashik that needed attention. “In Kazigadi, open pipelines and gutters are big problems. Grid should be laid on the parts of Kazigadi that crashed and became void. Monsson is approaching and pre-monsoon works are yet to be done in many areas. This may lead to mishaps,” Khaire said.
 
 She also complained about encroachments by utensil shops near a hospital in her area.
 
 Shyam Badode of the BJP complained about water supply problems in CIDCO area. “Water supply is not smooth in Indira Nagar, Rajiv Nagar and Pathardi. Mayor had recently conducted a meeting in this regard for prabhags 30, 31 and 23 and had instructed the officials that there should not be any problem henceforth. But the pressure of water supply is still less. Water tax collection in Indira Nagar is good but the supply is bad,” he said.
 
 Municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna asked the concerned engineers to resolve the issue at the earliest.
 
 Shiv Sena corporator Bhagwat Aarote said he had been asking for earthmover to clean  , but the NMC had not yet started the work. “There is no drainage line in prabhag 26. There is water problem as well,” he said.
 
 City engineer UB Pawar said, “Since 15 days we are cleaning nullhas, storm water drainage, chambers in different areas of the city. We are using all our manpower and earthmovers for this purpose.”
