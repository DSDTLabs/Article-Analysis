NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ( ) today dismissed all petitions related to the  's question paper leaks, saying it won't interfere with any of the Board's decision on a re-exam.
 
 
 The top court also turned down a plea for a CBI inquiry into the leaks of the Class 10   paper and the Class 12   paper. It dismissed a batch of petitions filed by students and parents. The CBSE earlier announced that the   Economics exam would be held again, on April 25. It also decided against holding a retest for the   math course.
 
 The CBSE yesterday decided to not hold a re-examination for the Class 10 mathematics course even though the question paper for the earlier test was leaked. Its decision came after a thorough analysis and evaluation of the answer sheets showed no specific trend that the leak had impacted the exam outcome, CBSE said.
 
 Meanwhile, three people, including two teachers of a private school, were arrested by the Delhi Police on Sunday for their suspected roles in leakage of the Class 12 economics paper.
 
 Following the leaks of economics and math question papers, the CBSE announced that the examination centres would henceforth receive an encrypted copy of the question papers on e-mail and they would need to download and print themselves.
