Visakhapatnam: Six militia members of Galikonda and Korukonda area committees of the CPI (Maoist) surrendered before Visakha Rural SP Rahul Dev Sharma on Sunday. The surrendered ultras have been identified as Korra Rajababu (42), Vanthala Sethu alias Tilusu (25), Vanthala Ramakrishna (35) and Vanthala Ravi (30), each of whom had a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on their heads, and Korra Mallana (30) and Pangi Bhaskar Rao (35). 

 Sharma said they decided to surrender as they were fed up with the ideology of the Maoists and want to lead a normal life by joining the mainstream. 
 
 The number of Maoist surrenders has been increasing and it would push development works in remote agency areas, the SP added.
 
 The police assured that they would withdraw all cases against the surrendered ultras and initiate the process to provide government benefits to the surrendered. 
 
 Sharma advised the surrendered militia members to persuade other Maoists to lay down arms and join the mainstream to lead a peaceful life. He added that they can freely surrender and no cases would be clamped against anyone.
