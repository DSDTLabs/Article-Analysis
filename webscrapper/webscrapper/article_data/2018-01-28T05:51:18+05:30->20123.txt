HYDERABAD: The increasing movement of cement mixer trucks, especially around the citys suburban areas, has adversely impacted the condition of roads in places such as Chandanagar, Kukatpally, Nallagandla, Manikonda and Tellapur. According to locals, the frequent plying of these heavy vehicles throughout the year, coupled the movement of water tankers - they are seen making several rounds of this belt for close to six-eight months - has left these stretches perennially damaged. 

 Worse, these trucks often leave a trail of wet cement on the roads which later solidifies leaving the road uneven. "This has been an issue in our area for several years now. While the roads are permanently damaged, whenever the potholes are filled, the movement of these heavy vehicles ensures that they road is back to its previous condition within days. In fact, each time a new construction happens along the road, it suffers more damage," said a bike service centre owner,  , at Tellapur.
 
 While most suburban roads are not built to withstand such heavy vehicular weights as per experts, these vehicles also pose additional threat of accidents to locals having little or no safety features. Many of these heavy vehicles are also rickety and can even overturn at turns. "This has happened twice along the road in our colony where the tanker overturned while manoeuvring its way past another small vehicle. The tanker had come onto the road suddenly from a bylane at high speed and tried to suddenly reduce the speed suspecting an accident. That led to a huge pothole on the road," said  , a local from  , in Chandanagar.
