 Chopped head and body parts of a male newborn were recovered from Hasanganj and Gudamba police station areas on March 29 and human sacrifice was suspected. The police rubbished speculations and suspected murder for personal enmity.
 
 On Saturday, police got autopsy done after 72 hours had passed. 
 
 Gudamba police inspector R K Singh said the recovered body parts seemed a week-old. “Doctors failed to conclude their report and did not state a clear opinion so we have sent the samples for DNA profiling,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Hasanganj police inspector U V Singh said DNA profiling of the recovered body parts will first be done separately and then matched. “It is a time taking process so we expect a report after 20 days,” said Singh.
 
 Trans-Gomti ASP Durgesh Kumar ruled out possibility of human sacrifice saying   was usually performed to fulfill wish for a male child. “Body parts recovered are of a male child so the theory is baseless,” he said, adding there had been no missing report in any such case. “We sought details from all police stations, even of neighbouring districts but there was no such case reported anywhere,” he said.
