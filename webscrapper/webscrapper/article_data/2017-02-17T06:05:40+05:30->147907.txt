KOLHAPUR: The number of new applications for Permanent Account Number (PAN) card has doubled in the Kolhapur region after demonetisation. According to the figures provided by the   (UTIITSL) the number has gone up from 15,000 applications per month to around 30,000.

 The   is considered as an important document to carry out higher value banking transactions. The Kolhapur division of UTIITSL — a government owned company, comprising Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg district — issues PAN cards on behalf of the Income tax (IT) department. “We are receiving more than double applications for PAN cards as compared to the pre-demonetisation period,” said an official.
 
 Shreya Vadarkar, manager of UTIITSL (Kolhapur), said, “We manage and issue PAN cards in five districts. The number of applications for the card has doubled in the last three months. Before demonetisation, we used to receive around 15,000 applications from the five districts every month. However, the picture changed now after demonetisation. In the last three months, we have received almost 90,000 applications for the PAN card.”
 
 He added, “The government has tightened the norms on money transactions and PAN card is now necessary for big transactions. It is also necessary for opening new bank accounts, general identity card, and filing income tax returns. Therefore, people are applying for the same in large numbers.”
 
 A senior bank official of a leading nationalised bank, on condition of anonymity, said, “PAN card is necessary for big money transactions. Nowadays, banks insist for PAN card to open new bank accounts. Even in the last three months, farmers connected with cooperative banks have moved to nationalised banks. Around 10,000 new accounts have been opened in Kolhapur district. This could have pushed the need for new PAN cards.”
