Pune: Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) newly merged villages will reap the benefit of the Mula-Mutha pollution abatement project.

 The civic body’s city improvement committee on Monday approved a proposal for the same and also sanctioned a new funding pattern for the project that will save up on expenses.
 
 “We have accepted the proposal to add the newly merged villages in the project. It will help provide river cleaning facilities to these villages,” Mahesh Ladkat, chairman of the city improvement committee, told TOI.
 
 As per the first plan, the Union government was to provide for 70% of the total cost. But the new plan states that the Centre will take care of 85% of the funds. It will reduce the financial burden on the civic coffers. The civic administration will have to spend Rs148 crore as opposed to the previously decided sum of Rs214 crore.
 
 The major components proposed under the project include construction of 11 new sewage treatment plants (STPs), which will provide an additional treatment capacity of 396 million litres per day (MLD) over the existing capacity of 477 MLD. Around 113.6km of sewer lines will be laid, besides renovation/rehabilitation of four pumping stations.
 
 The project also includes installation of a centralized system to monitor STPs, construction of 24 units of community toilets in slum and fringe areas, public participation and awareness programmes, GIS mapping of sewerage facilities.
