GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) is getting ready to install a gateway at its entrance. The planned gateway will provide security at the entrance to the   and increase its aesthetic appeal, officials said.

 For the construction of the gateway, the Authority has launched an open competition by initiating a request for proposal (RFP), inviting talented architects and designers. While the winner of the competition will be awarded the project, the entries judged second and third will be awarded cash prizes.
 
 According to Authority officials, more than Rs 10 crore has been budgeted for the venture. “The gateway will be created at the entry point of the 165-km Yamuna expressway, which connects   with Agra,” said Arunvir Singh, chief executive officer (CEO), YEIDA.
 
 The entrance will be designed in such a way as to both tighten security and enhance aesthetics, complete with hi-tech surveillance cameras, police posts and observation towers.
 
 “The entrance will be crafted to reflect YEIDA’s character to people entering the area. YEIDA’s planning and development will be mirrored in the gateway. We want to project YEIDA as the city which welcomes new ideas, new perspectives and new people. However, it will not interfere with the traffic movement of vehicles entering the Yamuna expressway,” the CEO said.
 
 The gateway will illustrate model landscaping and comply with environment parameters. Horticultural details, combined with civic amenities and public conveniences, will form a part of the entrance’s architecture. 
 
 The competition is open to experienced professionals, and a presentation of the designs is scheduled for Tuesday, June 6. Selected designer firms will be required to make a presentation of their ideas, after which technical and financial bids will be finalised.
