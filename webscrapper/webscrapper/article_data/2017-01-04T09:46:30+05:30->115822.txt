CHENNAI: Ordinary citizens may not get back a lost phone, but four hours after his high-end gadget was stolen from a restaurant, former minister and AIADMK spokesman   got it back.

 Police said Ponnaiyan was having coffee at a restaurant in   around 7.30am on Tuesday when his phone went missing from the table.
 
 The former minster, a resident of Y Block Anna Nagar, looked for his phone for a couple of minutes before lodging a complaint with the Anna Nagar police.
 
 Before noon, police informed him that the phone was back on the same table from where it was stolen.
 
 “I got back the phone within a few hours. It was on the same table where I had coffee,“ Ponnaiyan said.
 
 Police said the phone had important contact numbers and information. They are collecting CCTV footage from cameras installed adjacent to the restaurant to nail the thief.
