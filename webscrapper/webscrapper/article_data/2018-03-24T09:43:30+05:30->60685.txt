CHENNAI: As part of the ongoing drive against offenders to maintain law and order, the city police on Thursday arrested a history-sheeter and seized two rifles from him. 

 The accused - identified as N Karikalan, 32, residing at TP   - was one of the prime accused in a murder case reported at   in 2007. 
 
 Preliminary investigations suggest that Karikalan is a close aide of   who is serving time for another offence, police said. 
 
 He was spying on a rival gang in  , said an investigating officer. "Moorthy's gang had planned to murder some of the rivals after Karikalan traced their whereabouts." 
 
 Police, who received a tip on these lines, kept a close watch on Karikalan's movement. 
 
 On Thursday morning, police spotted Karikalan in a government bus near Pachaiyappa's college. 
 
 After noticing that cops were following him, he got down from the bus and tried to escape through   cemetery. However, the cops managed to chase him down. Later, he confessed about his attempts to gather information about rivals.
 
 Following this, police conducted a formal search at his residence in TP Chatram and found that Karikalan had hoarded rifles to execute the murder plot. Two rifles were seized from him, police added. 
 
 Earlier this week, five history-sheeters from the same locality were arrested. While three were nabbed at gunpoint, others were arrested for their alleged roles in planning the murder of Sudhakar, son of a drug peddler from the neighbourhood. 
 
 Timely intervention by police foiled their murder plan.
