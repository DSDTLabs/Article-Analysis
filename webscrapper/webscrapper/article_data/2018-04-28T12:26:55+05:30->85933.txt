RAJKOT: Anger among the members of Dalit community in Kutch escalated on Friday as the local police failed to nab the miscreants who put garland of shoes on statue of Dr B R Ambedkar on Thursday in Bhimasar village of   taluka.

 People were also angry with the ‘insensitive’ attitude of superintendent of police Kutch (east)   as she refused to hear representation from a group of women when she visited Bhimasar village on Friday morning.
 
 On Friday morning, people from Bhimasar, including women, blocked the   highway and burnt tyres causing heavy traffic jam and disruption for commuters. A group of people also blocked railway track near Bhimasar junction delaying five trains, which had to be halted at different stations. 
 
 Two goods trains were halted at Bhimasar junction, while one train each was stopped at Samakhiyali, Bhachau and   railway stations.
 
 Anjar police inspector   said, “The situation is now under control. The villagers did not ransack or damage any vehicles. We tried to ensure that traffic jam does not get bigger and diverted the vehicles towards alternate route. We also assured villagers that the accused will be nabbed soon.”
 
 After assurance from the police, the villagers withdrew the agitation for the day, but warned that if police fail to arrest the accused, they will soon intensify their protests.
 
 Bhimasar sarpanch Dinesh Tungaria said, “SP madam came to our village in the morning to see the statue of Babasaheb. When she was going back, some women from the village tried to meet her, but she refused saying that she did not have time. This angered the women.”
 
 However, Patel denied the allegation and said, “I generally go to the village and I meet people. Today also I heard them. I am having very cordial relation with all the villagers.”
