MUMBAI: To prevent allotments of multiple seats, students applying for   will not be allowed to log in to the portal from more than one computer at a time next academic year. 

 It has been brought to the notice of   that during the first-come-first-served rounds, students in some parts of the state claimed more than one seat by logging in to the portal from different computers at the same time. So, it has been suggested that multiple log-ins be disabled.
 
 Experts are holding meetings in different parts of the state to iron out problems in the online process ahead of the next year’s admissions. In one such meeting last month, some principals suggested real-time updates during the admissions. “When a student confirms or cancels the admission, the receipts are not generated in time creating panic,” said a principal. They have also suggested rectifications to ensure students get allotted seats according to the subjects they want and the subjects they have passed in SSC so that there are fewer rejections.
 
 Another suggestion is for providing students with a tab in the portal for ‘proceed for admission’ option. “There were instances when students claimed colleges confirmed their admissions even when they hadn’t approached them. This left the students out from the subsequent lists. To ensure that isn’t repeated, the student should have a tab in his or her login which they must activate if they want to secure admission at the allotted college,” said a member.
