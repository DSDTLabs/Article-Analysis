CHANDIGARH: While the first day of   began on a peaceful note, it didn’t remain so after the end of the session.

  (AAP) registered its first protest with speaker Rana K P when it disputed the seating arrangements for opposition parties where only two benches were given to the party in the front row. The other three benches of the first row were occupied by   (SAD) MLAs.
 
 AAP had won 20 seats and its ally Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) two seats. SAD has 15 MLAs of its own and its ally   has three.
 
 After the session, AAP's leader of opposition and senior advocate H S Phoolka took his MLAs to the speaker’s chamber and demanded that the entire first row should be given to the MLAs from their coalition.
 
 “It's only fair. We are the principal opposition party and we must get the first row. SAD is at the third spot in the election tally. Besides, we need to strategize with our ally LIP who have two MLAs. We need all five benches. We can't share our space with corrupt party like SAD," said Phoolka.
 
 LIP's two legislators and MLA brothers Simarjit Bains and   too echoed the AAP's demand. Bains brothers also protested that even the office rooms allocated inside the Vidhan Sabha building to three parties were not based on merit.
 
 The duo said the office occupied by the Congress during the last government should be given to AAP-LIP and that belonging to SAD should be taken by the Congress.
 
 “The party offices made inside the Vidhan Sabha have sizes according to the ruling and opposition parties of the day. AAP-LIP alliance is at the second spot. We must get bigger space than SAD as we have 22 MLAs and SAD-BJP has only 18 MLAs," said Simarjit.
