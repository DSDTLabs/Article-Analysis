Ranchi: From the candidates for the post of   to ward councilors, this edition of the Ranchi municipal   has witnessed huge participation from women.

 Out of the five candidates for the post of mayor, three candidates are women, including BJP’s Asha Lakra, JMM’s Varsha Gadi and Kusum Ranjita Singh Munda of Ajsu party. 
 
 Also, out of the total 479 candidates for the post of ward councilors of 53 wards in RMC area, 214 are women, which is around 45% of the total nominated candidates.
 
 Of the 53 wards, 24 are reserved for women thus giving more options for women representation. However, women have not only just filed nomination for the reserved seats but also for the unreserved ones.
 
 Asha Lakra, contesting for the post of mayor for the second term, said, “People have shown much faith in women with women been elected as mayors in the last two terms. This year too we hope that the voters will choose a female representative.”
 
 The female candidates for the post of ward councilors believe that women councilors would be of more help than their male counterparts. “Water, garbage disposal and most of the civic problems are directly related to households which are managed by women. This is a reason that if the ward councilor is a female, she will be able to relate to these day to day problems and work towards solving them,” said Anju Devi, a contestant for the post of councilor in ward 28.
 
 Some candidates believe that if women are elected as representatives, they will provide more employment options for other women in their wards. Geeta Kujur, councilor candidate from ward 32 said, “Women will work more for the welfare of other women and will work towards forming more self help groups for women employment.”
 
 Women participation is not just high in Ranchi but it has spiked across the state as well. Out of the total 4,120 ward councilor candidates in 34 urban local bodies going into election, 1,970 are women, which is 48% of the total candidates.
