AHMEDABAD: Last year, on an average, the city   registered five   every day and the loss of six lives every week. While police have registered a slight rise in the number of total road traffic accidents (RTA), the silver lining is that compared to 2015, fewer lives were lost on city roads.

  The year 2016 had seen a number of major road accidents where young lives were snuffed out and citizens vented their fury on public transport buses. While police are yet to analyze the accident data, senior officials said that roads on the city periphery remain as dangerous as before and two-wheeler drivers continue to form a majority of the victims of fatal accidents.
 
 “The most shocking incident last year was that of an AMTS bus running over two bikers at Nehrunagar on the day of Raksha Bandhan, and also injuring four others,” said a city-based road safety expert.
 
 “While the probe pointed towards technical issues, human error in terms of speeding could not be ruled out,” he said, adding, “Last year there were also a number of accidents involving dumpers, especially in eastern city parts. Over-speeding was also found to be a prime cause of accidents.”
 
 Observation of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on November 18 last year had seen family members of road   narrating how the accidents had claimed the sole breadwinners of their families or resulted in loss of their only children.
 
 Traffic branch officials said that mapping of major traffic accident hotspots remains ongoing, and Narol-Naroda, Odhav, SG Road, Danilimda-Pirana and Sarkhej have emerged as major accident zones.
 
 “SG Road has remained a major concern. We have held multiple meetings with various stakeholders so that the wrongly-put signage could be corrected, wrongly-constructed speed-breakers could be removed and zebra crossings could be painted prominently,” said a traffic police official.
