 Samit played a stupendous knock of 150 while his teammate   top-scored with 154 and together shepherded the team to a colossal 500/5 in 50 overs. Aaryan and Dravid Jr.'s efforts were backed up by their bowlers, who skittled Vivekananda School for a lowly 88.
 
 This isn't the first time that Samit has hit headlines for his cricket. Samit has been a constant scorer in the Under 14 category and two years back, representing Bangalore United Cricket Club (BUCC), which his father used to serve as a President, Dravid Jr. stroked 125 against   in the Tiger Cup cricket tournament, decorated with 12 boundaries.
 
 Samit was also awarded the 'Best Batsman' in a U-12 Gopalan Cricket Challenge in September 2015. Back then, he scored three match-winning half-centuries with scores of 77*, 93, and 77 in the final playing for his school Mallya Aditi.
 
 Samit's knock promises to come as a perfect birthday present for father Rahul - currently coaching the Under 19 team in New Zealand for the World Cup - who turns 44 on Thursday.
