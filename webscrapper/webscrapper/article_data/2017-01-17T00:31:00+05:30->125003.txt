Indore: Continuing the crackdown against illegal mining, a team of district administration on Sunday seized a poke lane machine and five dumpers from a mining site.

 “We have been receiving information about illegal mining by a gang. On Sunday morning, we received a tip-off about the gang digging and transporting morrum from a mining site. To this, a team accompanied by local police reached the spot and confiscated the vehicles,” the sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Neeta Rathore told TOI.
 
 The officer said to be successful in their second attempt as they had carried out a similar action on information of illegal mining by the same gang a few days ago. That time, they had managed to flee the scene.
 
 “On Sunday’s drive, the team also caught the driver. During preliminary interrogation, he said to work for one, Mahesh Choudhary. He also revealed that the same gang is active in Sanwadiya and Jamaniyakhurd. Further investigation was underway,” Rathore said. She added that no requisite permission was acquired for mining and transporting morrum.
 
 Sources said the accused could already have mined morrum worth crores of rupees and have nexus with local police officials for smooth functioning of illegal mining.
 
 Rathore said to continue their crackdown against those involved in illegal mining. Around two months back, Betma police had seized three dumpers transporting morrum.
