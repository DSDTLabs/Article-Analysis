New Delhi: The   sought a comprehensive report on Monday from the Centre on the status of probe conducted by a   (SIT) into the 1984 anti-Sikh riot cases in Delhi.

 A bench of justices Dipak Misra and R Banumathi granted four weeks’ time to the Centre to file a report after additional solicitor genera Pinky Anand told the court that SIT was examining 650 cases in connection with the riots. “As of now, 218 cases are under various stages of scrutiny and 22 cases have been identified for further probe,” she told the bench.
 
 The government said lapse of 32 years was taking a toll on collection of relevant documents and case files from police stations and courts. In many cases, documents were in Urdu or Gurmukhi which was delaying scrutiny, it said.
 
 It said the home ministry was monitoring the progress in SIT probe every fortnight. The Centre had constituted a committee headed by G P Mathur on December 23, 2014 and the committee recommended setting up of an SIT on January 22, 2015. On the basis of the recommendation, the government set up an SIT on February 12, 2015.
 
 The court was hearing a petition filed by S Gurlad Singh Kahlon, a member of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, seeking its direction to the SIT to finish the probe so that the accused could be brought to book.
