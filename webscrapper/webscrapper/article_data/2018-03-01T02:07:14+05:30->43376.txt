Tirupur: Police on Wednesday arrested two women who allegedly snatched gold chains from eight devotees during a temple festival at Keeranur near Kangeyam on Sunday. Police also seized eight chains, weighing a total of 37 sovereigns and worth over Rs 8.5 lakh, from the women. 
 
 The accused were identified as M Shanthi, 40, of Paramathi Velur in Namakkal district, and M Lakshmi, 23, of Pollachi. Police said the duo participated in the Kumbabishekam festival of Sri Selvanayaki Amman temple at Keeranur near Kangeyam on Sunday. About 3 lakh devotees participated in the festival. 
  
 “Despite a tight security arrangement with several CCTV cameras, eight woman devotees lodged complaints that they had lost their gold chains ranging from 2 to 7 sovereigns during the festival,” said a police officer. Police registered the cases and started investigation into them. 
  
 “We tried to catch the women with the help of some police personnel who suspected their activities during the festival. Finally, we nabbed them at Arulmighu Kariyakaliamman temple in Paranchervali in Kangeyam taluk,” said the officer. 
  
 During questioning, the duo admitted that they had involved in all the eight cases, the officer said. “They took advantage of the crowd near ‘theertham’ (holy water) and tree saplings receiving area,” he added. 
  
 The duo was arrested when they visited Kariyakaliamman temple to chalk out plans for chain-snatchings during the temple festival on March 4, police said. “The women were wanted for chain snatching cases in Puducherry and we suspect they might have involved many such cases,” the officer said. 
  
 After the arrest, the women were remanded in judicial custody.
