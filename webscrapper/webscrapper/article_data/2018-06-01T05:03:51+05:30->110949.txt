NAVI MUMBAI: Turbhe   have arrested a 'fatka gang' member who targeted mobile phones of commuters standing on the footboard of trains on the trans-harbour line. 

    (19), a resident of Digha, has been handed over to the Thane GRP, where an FIR was registered under sections 379 (punishment for theft) and 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft) of the IPC along with section 150E of the Railways Act for endangering the safety of a person travelling on railways.
 
  Turbhe RPF inspector   said, "After two incidents by the gang were reported on May 28, we formed two teams to nab the thief. He targeted commuters when trains neared   bridge under Thane GRP's jurisdiction. On Wednesday, RPF constable Rahul Kumar, who was in a Thane-Vashi train, stood on the footboard when Pawar hit him with a pole. We had deployed another team along the tracks, near Vitava bridge. Three constables were hiding in the bushes and kept a watch. When Kumar alerted the other team that he was hit, the officials rushed to the site and spotted the thief near the pole. Three constables nabbed him after a chase." The RPF staffer's dummy handset, used to trap the thief, was recovered from him.
