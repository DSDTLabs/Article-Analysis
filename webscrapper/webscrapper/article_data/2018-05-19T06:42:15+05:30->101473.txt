 “When I signalled, an   stopped. My daughter sat in the vehicle first, but when I was trying to enter, the driver fled. I kept shouting at him to stop and even ran behind the vehicle, but to not avail. Meanwhile, a passer-by saw my daughter crying from his car and gave me a lift so that we could follow the autorickshaw. Finally, after covering a distance of around half-a-kilometre, we managed to stop the auto. I rushed out of the car and got my daughter out. When I questioned the driver, he claimed, he was not aware that I was left behind. However, till the car driver parked his vehicle on roadside and came to get hold of the auto driver, he managed to escape with his vehicle,” as the 40-year-old woman said in her complaint.
 
 “My daughter was shouting and crying, but still the driver did not look back. This shows his foul intentions. I want a strict action against the auto driver,” added the woman.

 The woman told the police the registration number of the autorickshaw and preliminary investigation found that the vehicle was registered in the name of one Sarjen Ali. “We have identified the accused auto driver and are conducting raids to nab him. He will be arrested soon,” said Bijender Kumar, SHO, Sector 40 police station.
