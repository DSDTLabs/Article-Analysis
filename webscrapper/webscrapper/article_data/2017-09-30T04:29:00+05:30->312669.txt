Ahmedabad: Festive season appears to have had little impact on four-wheeler sales as the numbers have not even been close to expectations this Dussehra. On the contrary, car sales on Dussehra have registered a decline by at least 15% as compared to last year, indicate estimates by industry players. Automobile companies and dealers said that the sales have declined mainly due to a slow movement of sales, lack of new model launches and subdued consumer sentiment post demonetization and the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).

 “The sentiment has been significantly slow this time around and as compared to last year’s Dussehra, the numbers have declined slightly. The business has been dull after GST implementation more or less,” said Rajnish Arora, vice-president of a city-based Honda dealership.
 
 Experts also said that most automobile manufacturers have not launched new car models, instead only facelift versions of existing cars have been rolled out with mere aesthetic changes. Ideally, new models are among key growth drivers for cars. This could also be one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
 
 More than 3,500 car deliveries were scheduled from Ashtami to Dussehra. “An estimated 1,500 cars will be sold across our dealerships in Ahmedabad. The deliveries could have been better, however, there is significant waiting period for some of our products due to which we’re unable to fulfil the demand,” said sources in Hyundai Motors India Ltd.
 
 While the overall sentiment was significantly dull, a number of deliveries were also scheduled on Ashtami and Navami days.
 
 “As per a general belief, many people consider it inauspicious to buy metal on Saturdays. This time around, since Dussehra falls on Saturday, a number of our customers have scheduled deliveries on Ashtami and Navami days which are equally auspicious,” said a city-based dealer of Mahindra cars.
