 Ask Nandhan if he auditioned for the role, and he says, “Actually, I’d met Vasanthabalan sir when I went to invite him for the audio launch of my first movie. I don’t even know if he has seen that film, but I was excited when I got a call from his team recently, saying that he wanted to meet me. He didn’t say much during our meeting, and told me that he would call me soon. A few days later, he called me up again and said, ‘Nee romba azhaga irukka; unna vechu love story pannanum. But for this role, you will have to get a tan. Would you be able to do it?’ I immediately told him, ‘If it’s your film, I can do anything’.”
 
 He adds with a laugh, “My father (composer  ) accompanied me on the set, but Vasanthabalan sir told him that he can come only when the first copy was ready. He is such a thorough professional that way, and this film will definitely be a learning experience for me.”
 
 Nandhan plays GV Prakash’s friend in the film. “The story is about the bond between friends,” says the actor, who is all set to begin shoot for his next film as a solo lead soon.
