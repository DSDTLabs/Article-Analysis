AHMEDABAD: Controversy gripped the recent   survey ordered by the ministry of human resource development, which, in the survey form has asked professors and educationists to state their caste and religion.

 “The survey, All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), which covers all higher education institutions in the country is being conducted since 2010-11. But never in the past had the government asked such details regarding caste and religion,” said the former VC of a university. “The earlier form was simple and one had to mention name and other details. But there were no column for caste and sub caste,” he added.
 
 The survey even asks professors to mention which minority they belong to. The MHRD has also asked colleges to send details of students, who have been allotted rooms in hostels, along with information about their caste, including details as to whether they were from  , scheduled caste or scheduled tribe.
 
 The AISHE is to conduct an annual web-based survey that covers all institutions in the country engaged in imparting higher education. Data is being collected on several parameters such as teachers, student enrolment, programmes, examination results, education finance, infrastructure etc. Indicators of educational development, such as institution density, gross enrolment ratio, pupil-teacher ratio, gender parity index, per student expenditure, will also be calculated from the data collected through AISHE.
 
 A senior   officer said one fails to understand how caste details would help them in the survey to form policy. In one of the columns the government has also asked whether the person has studied on a reservation seat or on a general category seat.
