Romanian beauty   has been stealing the limelight lately for her equation with 
  superstar 
  and his family. Although the two continue to stay mum about their relationship status, their recent trip together to Maldives along with the family did little to rubbish all those relationship rumours. However, on the work front, Iulia has been hitting the high notes, by crooning singles with Himesh Reshammiya, Manish Paul while also crooning her own renditions of hit songs like ‘Main hoon hero tera’ and ‘Baby ko bass pasand hai’.
 
 During the shoot of her music video ‘Every night and day’, Iulia was asked about her proximity with Salman and his family. According to a report, the Romanian television star remained tight-lipped about her link-up, but couldn’t help gushing about the Khan family. Calling the entire family “beautiful”, Iulia said that she really admired them for their “unity and welcoming attitude”. She also went on to say that “their doors are always open for everyone”.
  
 Iulia has been spotted on several occasions, tagging along with the Khan family on holidays, festivals, get-togethers and even birthday parties.
