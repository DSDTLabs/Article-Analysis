Director   had a rather sweet, simple wedding ceremony in Chikamagalur. But, his industry colleagues ensured that he threw a lavish   bash for them. SuNi, who is known to be quite the romantic, tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend Soundarya Gowda. Both of them, dressed in chic outfits at the reception, were seen playing charming hosts, enquiring about each of the guests personally and ensuring they never let any selfie demand go unfulfilled.
 
  There was a big spread of local vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies, including the staple Ragi Mudde for the guests. A special mention must be made of the young directorâ€™s team of assistants and associates, who left no stone unturned to ensure that no VIP guest was left waiting or mobbed. Looks like this fairytale wedding is indeed set to have a happily ever after.
