KOCHI: The   (SIT), probing the alleged   of an   in Kochi, is yet to find the   that   (alias Sunil Kumar) used to record the visuals of the crime. On Tuesday, SIT had launched a search for the phone with the help of Indian Navy in the backwaters after the prime accused claimed that he had thrown the phone off Goshree Bridge.

 “We are yet to find the phone (reportedly a white-Samsung phone),” said a senior officer, after the search operation was called off at 6.30pm.
 
 Aluva CI Vishal Johnson and five Navy officials, including divers, began their operation under Goshree Bridge at 10.30am with sonar detectors. Both Sunil and Vigeesh were bought to identify the exact spot where phone was abandoned while returning to Ernakulam from Kolencherry around 8am on Thursday. Sunil had earlier claimed that he had dropped the phone in drainage at Thammanam. 
 
 SIT later took him to Kakkazham in Ambalappuzha around 12.30pm to the house of an accomplice (Manu), a private bus driver in Kochi. Sunil had approached Manu seeking help.
 
 The team found a SIM card and memory card from Manu’s home. Police are currently investigating whether these contain any vital clue or visuals.
 
 Meanwhile, Manu’s sister told the police that Sunil had met her brother after committing the crime and that Manu had asked her to give him a safety pin to remove the SIM and memory cards. Afterwards, they left for the seashore. Police, on Tuesday, scoured the area for evidence, in vain. She also claimed that she informed her brother about Sunil’s involvement in the alleged rape case after seeing the news and Sunil ran away immediately. Sunil had asked Manu to arrange a sum of Rs 10,000, which he refused, police said. Meanwhile, sources hinted that Sunil might have handed his phone over to another lawyer in Kochi and transferred the video to other devices. Police refused to confirm or deny this claim.
