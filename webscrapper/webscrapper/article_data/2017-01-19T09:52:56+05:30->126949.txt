Former basketball star   is grateful that his ex-wife   stuck by him when he was hospitalised after a drink and drug binge and wants to "repay" her for her support.
 
  The "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" star called off her divorce with the basketball star after he was hospitalised following a drink and drug binge at a brothel in 2015 so she could be by his side, something with Lamar is incredibly grateful for, reported Contactmusic.
  
  
 
  
  Speaking on "The Doctors", Odom said, "Khloe is important to me. She's been through all of this with me and she stood right by my side so I just wanna repay her."
  
  Issuing an apology to her and the Kardashian Jenner family, he added, "I just want to tell them I'm sorry for all that wasted time and wasted energy ... that in my addiction I didn't know who I was ... so I couldn't take care of myself. I damn sure couldn't take care of anybody else."
  
  It comes after the sportsman - whose divorce from Khloe was finalised in December - completed a voluntary 35-day stint in rehab so he could "better himself".
