PATNA: In a significant change of policing strategy, Bihar shall put all the police stations across the state under the direct scrutiny of the state police HQ.   This was decided at a six-hour marathon meeting of police and home department officials with chief minister Nitish Kumar. While the meet compared the crime scenario of the current year’s eight months with that of the corresponding period last year, the CM directed the officers to improve the law and situation at any cost.    Principal secretary (home) Amir Subhani, who also attended the meet, told newsmen the suggestion to bring police stations under the scrutiny of headquarters was given to the CM by senior police officers.    “This does not mean that the SSPs and SPs will become free from their responsibility. They will have to increase their monitoring, while the HQs will simultaneously scrutinise the crime pattern under the jurisdiction of every police station,” Subhani said.    The state police HQ hitherto would receive district-wise crime figures, and the data of police stations were monitored at the district level.    Sources said the CM laid emphasis on decreasing the number of cases pending for investigation in districts. “Our officers will have to increase the rate of filing charge-sheet so as to up the rate of conviction,” a source said and added the CM also pitched for speedy trial of cases involving heinous crime.    ADG (HQ) SK Singhal admitted 2 to 7% increase in crime, including minor scuffle.    Chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, DGP P K Thakur, ADG (special branch) Alok Raj, ADG (modernisation) Preeta Verma and zonal IGs were among those who attended the high-level meet.
