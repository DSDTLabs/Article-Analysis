GHAZIABAD: The district administration issued a warning to school managements in Ghaziabad on Thursday to strictly follow the revised class timings that have been imposed on them. The warning was issued through a letter by the education department after the administration received complaints about several schools not following the revised timings.

 On January 17, the district administration had directed for changes in school timings from Classes 1 to 8 due to fog and cold conditions. District magistrate   had ordered that classes be held only in between 9.30 am and 2.30 pm till further directions are issued.
 
 “However, it was brought to the notice of the administration that certain schools in the district are conducting classes without adhering to these rules. We have taken cognizance of the complaints. Strict action will be taken against the principals and management of the schools if they are henceforth found not adhering to these timings,” said  , district inspector of schools.
