MUMBAI: An exam supervisor became the fifth suspect to be arrested in the   question paper leak of March 19 on Monday. 

 Prashant Dhotre (22), a dropout hired as an exam supervisor at Kiddies' Paradise school in  , from where the paper leak happened, was arrested by investigating officer Daya Nayak.
 
 Dhotre decided to return to Mumbra thinking the matter had cooled so many days after the arrest of maths teacher   (47) and others, said the police.
 
 An hour after the arrest of Khan from his Ambernath residence on March 20 for the history and political science paper leak, Dhotre had received a call asking him to switch off his mobile, said the police. 
 
 Dhotre was appointed an SSC examination supervisor despite his having failed in the first year of junior college. 
 
 Subhash Borase, in-charge secretary of  , said it is teachers who are expected to supervise during exams. 
 
 "It is the chief conductor's responsibility to ensure that all teachers supervising the exams are appropriately qualified," he said. "The board has to rely on the chief conductors to conduct the exam."
 
 The police had registered a case on March 19 after an invigilator caught a 15-year-old SSC student who was found checking the paper on an   group called "Board ke imp" on the mobile.
