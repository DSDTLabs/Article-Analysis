GAYA: Police on Wednesday arrested  , chief of the Revolutionary Communist Centre (RCC), a splinter group of CPI (Maoist), during a routine vehicle check at Bodh Gaya. Accompanied by an aide, Marandi was riding an SUV at the time of his arrest.

 The police also recovered 7kg of ganja from the vehicle. Much to the surprise of the cops, Marandi was unarmed at the time of his arrest. RCC, it may recalled, is known to possess a strong armoury of sophisticated weapons, including assault rifles.
 
 Gaya SSP Garima Malik said Marandi was produced in the court and subsequently forwarded to judicial custody. “The vehicle has been seized,” said the SSP. More than 12 criminal cases are registered against Marandi with different police stations.
 
 According to sources, besides south Bihar, Marandi was also active in Jharkhand. Besides collecting extortion, the Marandi group has been involved in a bloody turf war with Maoists, the parent organisation of the rebel outfit.
 
 Asked if Marandi will be taken on remand for further interrogation, the SSP said a decision in this regard would be taken after due assessment.
 
 The arrested Maoist was also allegedly involved in a parcel bomb explosion in which a close aide of Tekari MLA   was killed at Kujapi village in 2015. Marandi was earlier arrested in May 2016 from Vishnupad area of the town. However, he was subsequently released on bail.
 
 Originally established by  , widow of the slain Maoist ideologue  , RCC was subsequently hijacked by Marandi and the organisation created a reign of terror in the Sherghati sub division area of Gaya district. Nirmala walked out of Maoist fold to register protest against the organisation’s failure to avenge Sagar Chatterjee’s death. Chatterjee was killed by the police in an alleged fake encounter in the neighbouring Aurangabad district.
