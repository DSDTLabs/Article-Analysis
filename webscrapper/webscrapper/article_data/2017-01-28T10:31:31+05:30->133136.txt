NAGPUR: A day after the   met under the   (NTCA) here to discuss poaching of wildlife on January 24, a leopard skin was seized from two locals on Wednesday from Melghat.

 “The matter is still being investigated and it would not be proper to reveal names of the accused as more people bordering   are involved. Both the accused have been remanded in forest custody ( ) till February 9,” said Ravindra Wankhede, deputy conservator of forests (DyCF), Gugamal division in   (MTR).
 
 Sources said the leopard skin has been well treated and is three months old. The leopard is suspected to have been killed by poisoning, a common practice used by locals to hunt wildlife. The animal must have been killed in Ghatang territorial range under East Melghat.
 
 One of the arrested accused hails from Motha in Ghatang and another from Doma village bordering MP. Both the accused were elusive and are frequently changing their statements.
 
 East Melghat DyCF S Yuvraj said, “We are looking for corroborative evidence before coming to any conclusion. It was a joint operation by territorial and wildlife officials.”
 
 The forest team, on Thursday, took the accused to bordering MP but there were no further arrests. Officials also ruled out role of Baheliya poachers in the leopard killing.
 
 In 2013, Ghatang was in limelight for poaching of five tigers, a sloth bear and a leopard by organized gang of poachers from Baheliya community in Katni. The skin was sold at Amdi near Ramtek to Sarju Bagdi, a trader from North India.
 
 Even as poachers have been put behind bars, poaching threat looms large over Melghat.
