AHMEDABAD: Will the 145-feet tall   containing 65 lakh tonnes of garbage continue to reach new heights? If  , the chairman of AMC’s standing committee is to be believed, the answer is yes. 

 On Thursday, the standing committee decided that the high-tension wires passing over the Pirana garbage mound will be taken underground as the mound has continued to grow unchecked. Officials said that the   may not incur any expenditure for moving the wires underground as Torrent power company may take up the project.
 
 The mound’s height now poses a threat to vehicles that go there, which may anytime come into contact with overhead wires leading to accidents. Waste disposal vehicles scale the mound regularly, while fire vehicles need to arrive infrequently to douse fires that often occur at the mound.
 
 During the standing committee meeting held on Thursday, Pravin Patel said that the high-tension wires were hindering the dumping of solid waste. Patel said the need to continue to dump waste over the present mound cannot be ruled out.
 
 The statement has raised many eyebrows as the corporation was supposed to stop dumping at the present site and go for recycling of waste while enforcing waste segregation at source. Officials said that it was discussed in the standing committee that the city, which currently generates over 4,000 tonnes waste daily, has to dump nearly 1,000 tones at the present Pirana site. The AMC is installing units to convert energy from 2,000 tons of domestic garbage, while another 500 tonnes of construction waste is processed separately.
