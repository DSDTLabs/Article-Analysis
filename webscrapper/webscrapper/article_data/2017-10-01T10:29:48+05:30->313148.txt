JAIPUR: A 22-year-old man from West Bengal committed suicide in Jaipur’s   area on Saturday following a tiff with his wife over choice of ‘sabzi’ for dinner. 

  lived with his wife   in a rented accommodation near Krishna Vihar under the limits of Jyoti Nagar police station area. “On Friday night Nirmala had cooked bhindi (Okra) sabzi for dinner. He was irked by the choice following which the couple had a heated debate,” said Guman  , assistant sub-inspect, Jyoti Nagar police station.
 
 On Saturday morning, Nirmala found her husband hanging by the ceiling fan. “She called up police and narrated the entire incident. She said that her husband did not work and was addicted to narcotics,” Singh said, adding that Nirmala works as domestic help and worked from morning till late evening.
 
 Vishal reportedly stayed at home and was looking for a job. “So far we have not recovered any suicide letter. But relying on the statements of the woman we suspect it is a suicide due to family tiff,” said Singh, adding that body of the deceased was handed over to the family following which the cops registered a case.
 
 The police said that their relatives would also be quizzed on the issue. “The incident has been registered and statements are being recorded. But prima facie it is suspected to be a case of suicide,’ said Guman Singh.
 
 The couple had come to Jaipur from West Bengal a couple of years ago. They brought a room in Krishna Vihar on rent.
