Ahmedabad: A 22-year-old woman — six months pregnant — hanged herself at her residence in Chandkheda on Thursday. Her mother filed a complaint with Chandkheda police accusing her husband and in-laws of abetting her suicide.

 Chandkheda police said Aruna Shrimali, 50, a resident of Sector 13, Gandhinagar, is a security guard at GIFT City. Her complaint states that her daughter Kajol, 22, married Dhaval  , a resident of Saraswati Society in Chandkheda, one year ago.
 
 “Soon after the wedding, marital discord emerged. Shrimali says Kajol was a victim of domestic violence by her husband and in-laws. The family would tell her to make truce as she was pregnant and was expecting her first baby. She continued to complain when she recently went to Gandhinagar for a week. Kajol’s baby shower was fixed for the third week of May,” said an investigator.
 
 On Thursday, Shrimali was told that Kajol had been hospitalized after a suicide attempt. When she and other family members reached the hospital at 1.30pm, Kajol had died. They later learned that she had hanged herself from a ceiling fan with a sari.
