Panaji: An allocation of Rs 1.5 lakh set aside in the annual budget of Corlim panchayat for disposal of dead animals raised eyebrows at the Sunday gram sabha even as the financial statement was later approved. The meeting which was chaired by sarpanch Supriya Kerkar possibly the last one before the ensuing panchayat elections recorded poor attendance, as the budget to the tune of Rs 2.40 crore approximately was taken up and passed after discussion. A member, Baptist Pereira questioned the huge allocation amounting to Rs 12,500 per month set aside for disposal of dead animals. A small stretch of the highway passes through the village, he pointed out. The issue of gaddas along the highway was also raised and members grilled the panchayat authorities on the issue whether it has powers to allow them. The gaddas are also stationary instead of being mobile, they said. The members also sought information about the infrastructure work carried out in the village though the panchayat receives income of over Rs 1 crore. Kerkar explained that drains have been built in the village, but members pointed out that this alone does not comprise infrastructure and that there is no market in the village. The panchayat authorities said that the comunidade should provide land for it.
