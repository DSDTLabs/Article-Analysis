Actor   has said she was angered by the social media reaction to her split from   star   

  
  
  The duo separated in August last year after eight years of marriage, and identical divorce papers were filed in December, with both citing   differences. Faris said she was annoyed at how some people mourned their break-up and dramatically proclaimed "love is dead", after holding the pair up as an example of the perfect couple. 
 
  "I had a little bit of a childish feeling like, 'Oh, come on, f*****g grow up,' like, a little anger. Chris and I did talk about, like, 'Oh boy (we're letting fans down)', and we got on the   feed (messages like), 'Love is dead' and 'relationship goals '," she said. The 41-year-old actor, however, believes they were partly to blame for having "cultivated the idea of this beautiful family" with their previous social media photos. 
 
  "I do think, we obviously cultivated something (the idea of a perfect relationship), and it was rewarding for a while, like, 'Oh, people seem to think that we got all this s*** (sorted), that's nice!'," she said. Faris is not sure if she would be willing to walk down the aisle again in future. 
 
  "I need to figure out what the purpose (of marriage) is. Is it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I'm just not quite sure where it fits," she said.
