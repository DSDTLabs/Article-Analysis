Whether in   or in   as police superintendent and later as police commissioner of Police, Himanshu   (54) was the people's officer due to easy accessibility. 

 In his career spanning over three decades, Roy successfully probed cases like journalist   murder, Shakti Mill gangrape and the 2013 IPL spot-fixing. Roy built a case on the basis of circumstantial evidence and filed a chargesheet within the stipulated period, as a result all these cases resulted in convictions. 
 
 The J Dey murder case was the most difficult case, as there was no direct evidence to establish that he was killed following instructions of gangster Chhota Rajan, who got a life term. As joint police commissioner (crime) and as additional DG (anti-terrorism squad) too, Roy successfully investigated key cases. Whenever people approached then home minister R R Patil, Roy was his first choice. 
 
 While as his career graph was soaring, he was shifted to the insignificant Maharashtra Police Housing and Welfare Corporation. He later found that he was suffering from cancer, but he never gave up the battle. Recently, when I met him at his south Mumbai flat, he was confident making a comeback. Roy's exit has shocked the entire police force.
