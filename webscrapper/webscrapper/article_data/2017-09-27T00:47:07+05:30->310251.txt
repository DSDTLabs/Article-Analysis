Coimbatore: Two mobile phone jammers will be installed in Coimbatore Central Prison soon to curb the use of cell phones by its inmates. Each jammer costs Rs 43 lakh.

 “We have received two mobile phone jammers and the installation work will start soon. We will discuss with senior officials to take a call on whether the jammers should be installed at Wall Medu, sub-jail or other blocks of the central prison,” said prison superintendent M Senthilkumar.
 
 The state government had earlier allotted Rs 5 crore for procuring 12 mobile phone jammers to be installed in various central prisons to control the use of mobile phones by the prisoners. Two mobile phone jammers had already been installed at the Puzhal Central Prison.
 
 According to prison ADGP C Sylendrababu, the prison authorities had seized 283 mobile phones from prisoners across the state in 2016 and 187 this January-July. Sylendrababu had visited the Coimbatore Central Prison last month.
 
 The prison authorities said the two   would cover a vast area of the central prison premises and help control smuggling of mobile phones into the prison. Presently, 15,000 prisoners are lodged in various prisons across the state. Coimbatore central prison has more than 1,700 inmates.
