Actor Shajon is one of the Malayalam artistes who won praises aplenty for variety portrayal of characters on screen, despite having a predominant mimicry background.

 Shajon's performance in Jeethu Joseph's 'Drishyam,' as Mohanlal's villain, was widely appreciated. However, reports indicate that the actor had won a villain role much before, in the film 'Kunjikoonan' in which Dileep played the lead role. The hero apparently objected to offering the role to Shajon though he was already on the set and the make up man began preparing him for the shot. 
 
 Dileep wasn't reportedly convinced that a mimicry actor can play the story's villain and that resulted in Shajon losing the role. The Drishyam actor left the set with teary-eyed, if the stories are to be believed. At a time when Dileep is jailed in the case of an actress' recent assault, many reports about how he marred the careers of many in the industry are coming out. While the actor's lawyer is confident that there isn't enough proof against him and that he will be released soon, the whole of Mollywood has already turned their back on the tainted actor.
