After five days, the police booked her husband and   on charge of dowry murder following a complaint lodged by the woman’s mother.

 Four months into pregnancy, Priya was found   in her room at her Badha village home. Though her in-laws claimed that she used a duppatta to make the noose and kill herself, Priya’s mother Sushila on Friday filed a complaint against her husband and in-laws for allegedly killing her.

 “He was a drunkard and used to beat my daughter frequently in an inebriated state. He and his family used to torture her for dowry, and finally killed her,” Sushila alleged.
 
 Based on her complaint, the police have booked Raj, his mother Saroj, brother Sumit, sisters Rakhi and Lali under sections 304-B ( ), 34 (common intention) of the IPC.
 
 “A case has been registered and we are verifying the allegations,” said inspector Yashwant Yadav, SHO, Kherki Daula police station.
