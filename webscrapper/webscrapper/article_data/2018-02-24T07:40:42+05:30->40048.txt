KOLKATA: A 20-year-old student of a reputable city college who stays in a rented accommodation in   has alleged she was hit by a biker after she raised an alarm when he tried to molest her. The incident was reported last Wednesday and a police complaint was filed the next day. Till late Friday, however,   police - which lodged the FIR - have not been able to trace the accused. 

 According to the woman's complaint, she was walking near   on her way home around 7.30pm when a biker stopped her at an isolated stretch. The biker began to make offensive comments and made some sexually explicit propositions. When the woman tried to raise her voice and seek help, the accused hit her with the front wheel of his bike, leading to her falling and sustaining minor injuries. The accused then fled. The woman was initially in shock and registered her complaint the next day. Cops said the process of recording her confidential statement before a magistrate has also begun. "Once we identify the bike, we can identify the accused. We are taking help of local resources and CCTV footage," said an officer.
 
 Locals in the   belt claimed, of late, there have been a number of unknown bikers who have been racing in the area. The residents will approach police and local councillors on March 3 and ask them to take preventive measures. Jadavpur police have said they will increase patrolling in the area.
