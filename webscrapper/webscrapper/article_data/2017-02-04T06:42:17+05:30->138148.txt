HYDERBAD: Raising the hopes of frequent fliers,   (RVNL) and GMR are jointly conducting a feasibility study for the construction of an underground rail network connecting the city to   (RGIA).

 At present, the   service from various stations in the city extends in the direction of the airport till Falaknuma, although a railway line exists from Falaknuma till Umdanagar. The joint study will examine which point would be feasible for the underground network. 
 
 Addressing the media,   general manager   said they are exploring the underground route to establish connectivity from the city to the airport as GMR airport authorities are unwilling to part with land for an overground extension of the MMTS servicve to the airport. GMR is favourable in case MMTS is terminated 1.2 kilometres away from the airport and a bus service is arranged to ferry passengers to the airport terminal.
