 and Sussanne Khan’s love story gave many of us relationship goals. However, when the news of their separation followed by an ugly divorce came out, it broke a lot of hearts. 

 It has been a couple of years since the two parted ways, but they have been spotted on several occasions together. From quiet dinners to kids’ birthday celebrations to new-year vacations, Hrithik-Sussanne have raised our eyebrows, making us wonder what’s brewing between the two.
 
 Even though it seemed all happy-go-lucky on the outside, it seems that this divorce affected their two sons Hrehaan and Hridaan deeply. So much so, that the two boys haven’t been able to concentrate on their academics as much.
 
 Thus, the divorced couple is planning on giving their relationship another try for the sake of their kids. Reportedly, the ‘Kaabil’ actor has also purchased a house near his house for Sussanne and their kids to move into. This will let the kids get easy access to Hrithik and his family, and they can come and spend as much time as they want once they shift.
 
 Hrithik was also linked with a model who had posted a picture of them together on social media. That picture went viral in no time and Hrithik immediately retorted to this allegation of knowing the model closely and asked her who she was.
 
 Even though neither of the parties has confirmed the reports, we hope that the two work things out that will make it all good in the hood.
