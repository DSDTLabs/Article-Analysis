BHOPAL: The state government's surprise decision to accord minister-of-state (MoS) status to five Hindu religious leaders, just seven months before assembly elections, has triggered a political storm. 

 
  CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan defended his decision, saying in Tikamgarh: "Every section of society should be involved in development and public welfare. This is an effort to connect every section." Congress, however, launched a scathing attack on him and his government, calling it a "political gimmick".
 
  
  As a tactic, the MoS tag seemed to work since   and   - two of the severest critics of the government - promptly dropped their plan to launch a 'Narmada Ghotala Yatra' against alleged irregularities in last year's government-backed Narmada Sewa Yatra and the 'record' plantation of 6 crore saplings. The Ghotala campaign was scheduled to begin on April 1, but on March 31, Computer Baba, Mahant and three other religious leaders -  ,   and   - were appointed to a committee for conservation of Narmada. 
 
  Computer Baba told reporters in Bhopal on Wednesday that "there was no need for protests now". "We have cancelled the campaign because the government has fulfilled our demand to form a committee of saints and seers for protection of Narmada," he said, adding: "Under this government, religion and politics go hand-in-hand. It's a good thing." 
 
 Mahant, who has been a vocal critic of Chouhan and seen marching with Congress veteran Digivijaya Singh on his 3,400km Narmada Parikrama, spoke in a much mellowed voice on Wednesday. "The question of a campaign against Narmada Yatra does not arise as we will work together with the government for conservation," he told TOI.
