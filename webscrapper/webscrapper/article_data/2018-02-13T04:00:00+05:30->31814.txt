Palanpur: A 52-year-old NRI (non-resident Indian) from Saudi Arabia Mehmudmiya Chhotemiya Shaikh died of swine flu in Dharpur Medical College of Patan on Monday. His wife Shehnaz Shaikh, who was suspected to be infected with swine flu virus, died at a private hospital in Patan last Friday. 

 The couple had come to their native in Patan about three months ago along with their son and were residing at Kali Bazaar in Patan. The couple was to return to Saudi Arabia later this month. 
 
  “While Mehmudmiya tested positive for H1N1 virus on Monday before his death, his wife died of suspected swine flu at a private hospital last Friday,” chief district health officer (CDHO) of Patan Bharat Goswami said. “Son of the deceased couple is also suffering from the cough and cold and is under treatment. A medical team is reviewing the first swine flu case of the season,” Goswami added.
 
 Goswami further said, “We are taking all possible preventive measures on a war-footing. Three survey teams are now conducting the surveillance work in the affected area and medicines are being provided to affected people. We have so far surveyed about 158 houses and found 12 cases of cold and cough.”
