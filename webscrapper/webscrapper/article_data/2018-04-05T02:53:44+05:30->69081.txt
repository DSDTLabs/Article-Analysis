NEW DELHI: The leak of the Central Board of Secondary Education ( ) question papers will not impact the evaluation process, and there will be no   in the declaration of the Board   results. Meanwhile, each copy would be checked by two examiners this time following last years’ errors in totalling the marks. 

 CBSE exam branch officials said that the centralised evaluation process in underway. “The evaluation process is going as per the schedule. The alleged leaks have not impacted it in any way. So, we are expecting the results to be declared around the same time it usually is,” said an official on condition of anonymity. The Board has also strengthened the evaluation process this time. After the declaration of the Class XII results last year, TOI highlighted how a Mumbai student, who scored 80% and above in all his subjects, scored just 50 in maths. After verification, his marks were revised to 90.
 
 That was not an isolated case, as a Delhi student scored a mere 68 in mathematics in her Class XII exam, while scoring 99 in economics, 95 in accountancy and 96 in business studies. 
 
 Her marks in maths were revised to 95 after verification. Another student from the city had scored 42 in maths, and after applying for verification, the marks changed to 90.
 
 “This year more accountability has been set on the head and assistant head examiners. The assistant head examiners will get four examiners to be grouped in twos. Each teacher will check the answer sheets separately, which will help check such errors,” said an official.
 
 Moreover, 10% of the checked copies will be randomly picked up by the assistant head examiner for rechecking. “This would ensure another layer of checking to avoid calculation errors. The examiners will also cross-check the evaluated answers multiple times with the marking schemes so that evaluation process is secured,” said the official.
