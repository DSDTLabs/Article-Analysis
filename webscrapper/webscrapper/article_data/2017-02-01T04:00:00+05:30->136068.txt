Chennai: The arrest of senior   officials and subsequent charges made by CBI that the state owned lender failed to follow norms while lending to Kingfisher Airlines may bring restructuring of stressed loans under cloud, a senior banker said.

 Addressing The KS Narayanan Oration,  , chairman of mortgage lender,   said that there are allegations going around that IDBI lent money without due diligence. “Over the past week, few PSU bank chairman whom I met told me that they would rather take their stressed assets cases through to the newly constituted bankruptcy code, rather than renegotiate or restructure loans,’ Parekh said. “Several PSU bankers are worried now,” he said. 
 
 While private sector lenders were amenable to sit and negotiate with borrowers to restructure loans, Parekh said, the issue was complicated in PSU banks. “The government nominee has to accept,” he said. “In our case we sold our Unitech portfolio to asset Reconstruction Company and so did HDFC Bank which sold its Essar portfolio,” he said.
 
 One of the concerns in India is lack of clarity in   law and corporate tax, he said.
 
 Terming the objectives of demonetization as laudable, “but whether it was succeeded or not it is anybody’s guess,” he said.
 
 Parekh said that in any economy four key engines drive growth viz., government expenditure, private consumption, private spending and exports. “Of these two are not working — exports and private spending,” he said.
