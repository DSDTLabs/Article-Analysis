NEW DELHI: Veteran   MP   has emerged as the frontrunner to head the party in  , an appointment aimed at starting early preparations for assembly elections slated for late 2018.

 Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia are locked in the race for the top state organisational position.
 
 But Nath could prevail owing to his seniority amid the realisation that the highlyfactionalised state unit will have to put up a united challenge against BJP which has won three consecutive terms since 2003.
 
 It is felt that Nathâ€™s seniority will ensure the support of all party factions in which former CM Digvijay Singh is an important cog.
 
 The MPCC chief is being considered as part of a larger reshuffle package. If Scindia loses out, he will be rewarded with a key Congress responsibility to ensure his projection as the future leader.
