MUMBAI: Following the second phase of the   , municipal commissioner   has slammed contractors for discrepancies found in repairs done in the last three years. The report was submitted to Mehta last week.

 The BMC on Thursday issued show-cause notices to 11 contractor firms named in the report. Of the 11, six are those against whom the BMC filed police cases after the first inquiry report said they had defrauded the corporation.
 
 In his remarks on the show-cause notice proposal, the BMC chief said: “It is imperative that once again action is taken to set things right and ensure that public money is spent with care and caution.Issue show-cause notices to all contractors whose irregularities are beyond the tolerance limits mentioned in the tender document. Further, in view of largescale and serious irregularities, which have adversely impacted the quality of roads in the city , an FIR should be lodged against all concerned.“
 
 The show-cause notice lists out the discrepancies the inquiry panel found in its study of 200 roads. The notice states that as per the scope of work and specifications of the contract, the contractor was required to execute road crust layer below pavements of specified thickness and to also undertake excavation and transportation. The notice says the inquiry report found that the various road crust layers laid were of thickness lower than specified by the BMC.
 
 The notice states that if the BMC doesn't receive a reply within 15 days, it will be assumed that the contractors have nothing to say in the matter and further action, including blacklisting and deregistration, would follow.
