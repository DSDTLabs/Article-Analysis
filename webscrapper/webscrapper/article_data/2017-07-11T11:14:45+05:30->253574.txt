VARANASI: The level of the Ganga rose alarmingly in the last 24 hours. Most of the steps of ghats were submerged by Monday morning. The river began rising from July 7.

 Meanwhile, the flood-like situation, that usually arises by August-end or the first week of September, knocked the doorsteps almost a month before. The rise in Ganga had adversely hit the business of vendors and boatmen dwelling in and around the ghats. Pandas, too, had to suffer as they had to relocate and shift to temporary places to perform daily rituals.
 
 Taking note of the continuous rise in Ganga, the district administration directed officials to enforce ban on the operation of small and big boats in Ganga. Special security arrangements have been made on the ghats for jalabhishek. Arrangements are also on to set up 'sharnarthi shivir' (shelters camps) in different locations in the city as a precautionary measure in case of flood. The PAC and special divers have been deployed at the bathing areas on the ghats keeping in view the large number of   bathing there.
