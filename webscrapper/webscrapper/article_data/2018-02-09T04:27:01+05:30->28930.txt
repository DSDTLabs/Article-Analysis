MUMBAI: Officials with hand-held devices will soon issue tickets to commuters in the AC local train on  , like BEST buses. 

 WR divisional railway manager Mukul Jain said on Thursday the devices could be introduced on board in a week. It is not clear how many officials will be deployed or how many devices will be introduced in the first phase.
 
 "Issuing tickets on board the AC local will solve the problem of passengers travelling without valid tickets," said another official. "Many passengers think the first class ticket or pass is valid for travel in these trains, and they end up paying fines. Now, they can board the train and travel after purchasing a single journey AC ticket. It will be a win-win situation for both commuters will not be fined and railways will earn revenue," he said.
 
 Those who board with second class tickets may be permitted to purchase an AC ticket, sources said. Soon after the full launch of the AC train from January 1, some commuters complained that they were unable to purchase tickets on time and missed the train.
