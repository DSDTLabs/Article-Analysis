NEW DELHI:   politician Shashi   found himself in yet another Twitter kerfuffle on Thursday. He posted a   greeting for his 6.6 million followers, but tweeted an image of Lord Buddha. Even as he accepted the faux pas and joked about it, people wished him for various festivals with unrelated images . 

  Tharoor posted the tweet early on Thursday morning. It was a poster-like image featuring Lord Buddha and text at the bottom that read "Happy Mahavir Jayanti." After several people pointed the gaffe out to him, he posted the link from where he had gotten the picture and wrote, "Authentic, accepted alternatives most welcome. At least, thanks to my apparent error, a lot more people are tweeting on Mahavira!" 
 
  Tharoor did not delete the erroneous tweet. "I believe in owning up to my mistakes & not concealing the evidence of my errors," he wrote.
