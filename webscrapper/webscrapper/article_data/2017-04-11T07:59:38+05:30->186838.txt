GUWAHATI:   has seen only an 11.3% increase in households with an   in the past decade from 72.5% in 2005-06 to 83.8% in 2015-16, according to the latest National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS). 

 In contrast, Sikkim and Nagaland had each registered 20% and 17.8% increase respectively in households with Sikkim recording 77.6% in 2005-06 to 97.6% in 2015-16, and Nagaland recording 62.8% in 2005-06 and an increase of 80.6% in 2015-16.
 
 Mizoram in 2015-16 alone recorded 91.5% households having an improved drinking water source, shows the study.
 
 Improved drinking water source can be defined as piped water into dwelling, yard plot, public tap, standpipe and tube-well or borehole, protected dug well, protected spring, rainwater, community reverse osmosis (RO) plant and other facilities.
 
 Water experts said decisions that should have been made at the administration level, especially in Assam in the context of improved water sources coverage pattern with equilibrium to population explosion, was not forwarded.
 
 Also, an increase in chemical contamination and inability to sift from ground water to surface source due to lack of infrastructure were some of the reasons for the slow coverage in Assam.
 
 "The budgetary push allocation has been constantly low in the past three to four years. Besides that, at a recent action plan meeting it was specifically mentioned that the focus should have been on the existing old schemes and instead of on the new ones," said a source.
 
 States like   and   had also recorded slightly higher figures than that of Assam with 87.5% and 87.3% respectively, according to NFHS-4. Only Manipur and Meghalaya recorded lower figures with 41.6% and 67.9% respectively.
 
 Simanta Kalita, senior programme coordinator of the Centre for Environment Education (CEE), North East, said the geographical pattern in this region was one of the factors that made storing water difficult.
 
 "People cannot store water in some pockets of the region due to its geographical terrain. Even digging wells does not help. In places where it is available, there are issues like water portability. Biological and chemical contamination is another aspect that needs to be looked into," added Kalita.
