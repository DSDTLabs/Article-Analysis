Rap-star   shares a great bond with many Bollywood stars but the kind of rapport he shares with   is not a hidden thing anymore.

 Be it sharing the same stage or matching each other's footsteps, the duo never shied away from sharing their affection for each other.
 
 You must be wondering why we are sharing this now. Well, it all started when the social media went frenzy to wish   on his special day which was a few days back.
 
 Although, Honey Singh wished the 'Befikre' actor a little late but the latter's reaction was something which caught everyone's attention and this certainly proved how much Ranveer missed Yo Yo.
 
 Honey Singh tweeted, "Mere Jigar ke challey @RanveerOfficial ko belated  ."
 
  
  
 
 To which the 'Gunday' actor replied, "JOJOOOOO! Tu meri jaan hai JOJO! :) LOVE YOU BRO! I miss you alot! come back and give some righteous anthems ! big big hug".
