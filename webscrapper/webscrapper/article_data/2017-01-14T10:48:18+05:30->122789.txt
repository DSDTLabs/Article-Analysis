PUNE: The  ,  , and Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, may conduct   from the academic year 2018-19.

 A team of delegates from   had visited SRFTI earlier this week to talk about the modalities of conducting the common exam. After deliberations, it was concluded that a common test would not be possible for the next academic session (2017-18). But it can be conducted for the 2018-19 academic session. 
 
 FTII and SRFTI offer film education under the ministry of information and broadcast. The academic council meeting of FTII would be held on January 17 in Mumbai.
 
 Bhupendra Kainthola, the director of FTII, said, “A lot of issues were discussed in the meeting in SRFTI. This time, we are not doing it ( ) because of time constraint. For the academic year 2017-18, we will be conducting the entrance test our way and they will be doing the admissions their way because we have to complete both the processes smoothly and on time. But talks will be on to conduct a common entrance exam.” 
 
 He said having a common entrance would be a win-win situation for both students and the institutes. “We conduct the written exam in 24 centres in the country and SRFTI also conducts its exam in almost as many centres. FTII incurs a cost of about Rs 30 lakh for the entire process. With a common entrance procedure, this cost can be cut down. Second, students won’t have to pay two exam fees and spend money on going to exam centres twice,” said Kainthola.
 
 Sougata Bhattacharyya, the film & research officer at SRFTI, said, “The framework of entrance in both FTII and SRFTI are the same. In both the cases, students apply online and take a written exam. Students shortlisted after the entrance exam are given an orientation on respective campuses. Thereafter, they appear for an interview. Then students are selected for different courses,” he said.
