There is a lot happening in singer   Tirupti’s life right now — top among them are her National Award and her theatre debut. The petite, Indo-Canadian singer who has given us 'The  ' ('OK Jaanu), ' ' and 'Baarish' ('Half Girlfriend') and 'Kanha' ('Shubh Mangal Saavdhan'), is still in a daze after bagging the country’s top award.

 Shashaa won the Best Female Playback Singer for ‘Vaan Varuvaan’ from 'Kaatru Veliyidai', for which AR   also won the national Award for Best Composer Award. She says, “It’s very humbling to get the National Award. You have got the name of the nation attached to it. It is pretty surreal.”
 
 ' ' is special because my guru AR Rahman has composed it. I had grown up listening to his work and never thought that I would actually end up working with him.”
 
 Shashaa believes that an award of that stature brings along huge responsibility. “There is tremendous pressure to live up to the standards such recognition brings,” she says.
 
 She is also excited about her theatre debut with Mayur and Ulka Puri. “They were looking for someone who can sing and act and called me for an audition. I am playing the female lead with Mayur. It is an interesting play, that is intelligent and has satire and humour in the right doses. I am also singing in the play, so, it is great!” she signs off.
