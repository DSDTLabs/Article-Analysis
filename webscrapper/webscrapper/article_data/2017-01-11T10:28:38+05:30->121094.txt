THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   here will on January 19 hear a petition against chief secretary   that alleges that he is hoarding files relating to probe against senior officers.

 The petition filed by  , a native of Thiruvananthapuram, said that it was with the support of the chief secretary that the IAS officers are striking against the government. The petition said that despite the vigilance director making several recommendations seeking action against several officers, the chief secretary has sabotaged and hoarded many of such reports. He alleged that the chief secretary had been leaking all relevant documents to the accused from the reports against them, and also been accepting re wards for these.
 
 He also said that the chief secretary committed serious criminal offence in hoarding the reports and sabotaging the proof provided by vigilance director Jacob Thomas and additional chief secretary (home and vigilance)   against corrupt officers. The petition cited the complaints against additional chief secretary (labour) Tom Jose, DGP T P Senkumar and ADGP (intelligence) R Sreelekha and said that the recommendations by vigilance director to remove them from their designations and take action against them was not complied with after conspiring with them.
 
 The court has already asked the vigilance to file reports in the probe against ADGP R Sreelekha and another petition against Vijayanand on January 20. The court has asked the vigilance to file its probe report against Sreelekha on a complaint by the same petitioner seeking probe against alleged irregularities during her tenure as transport commissioner, and another petition against Vijayanand alleging that he deliberately delayed action on the report against Sreelekha.
