NAGPUR: Sighting of a greater flamingo at   lake has thrilled bird watchers. According to experts, this is for the first time a flamingo has been recorded at Ambazari lake.

 The bird was sighted by amateur bird watchers   and Niranjan Atre for three hours. Dr Anil Pimlapure, a dentist by profession and well-known bird expert, said, “There is no record of flamingos at Ambazari, although the tall bird was sighted at Gorewada lake in the 90s.”
 
 Dr Pimlapure said the bird might be on passage migration and must have landed at Ambazari owing to exhaustion due to heatwave. “The birds have been previously sighted in various parts of Vidarbha, including Akola, Amravati, and cities like Mumbai, Pune and Nashik. When they are not breeding, they are spread across different places in the country,” said Dr Pimplapure.
 
 Three years ago, a flock was also sighted at Paradgaon lake on Umred Road. Similarly, avid bird watcher from Pandharkawda Ramzan Virani, had recorded the birds presence in 2015.
 
 Virani said, these birds start migrating from November but come to Saikheda, a water body near Tipeshwar in Pandharkawda in April. This is the second year the birds have arrived at Saikheda. Last year, 18 birds were sighted. “The lake should be opened up for tourists as a bird destination and should be promoted along with Tipeshwar sanctuary,” said Virani.
 
 Greater and Lesser flamingos come from parts of  , South Europe and South West Asia, and foothills of Himalaya. From the month of November, these birds start migrating to Sewri mudflats in Mumbai. They stay here till June.
 
 Viranai said, these birds come at night and can travel up to 500km at one time. While they migrate, they may take only one to two stops in between. The population of flamingos reaches around 15,000 to 20,000 at Sewri mudflats.
