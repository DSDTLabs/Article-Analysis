VARANASI:   president   accused   of looting the country for 60 years and wondered why AICC vice-president  , who was termed as immature by former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit, is being imposed upon UP.

 Shah was addressing an election rally in Nizamabad constituency in Azamgarh district on Friday in support of BJP candidate Vinod Rai.He claimed that there was an undercurrent in favour of BJP and the party was going to form its government in the state with two-thirds majority.
 
 He said that the BSP and SP rules had destroyed the state in past 15 years. The state is at top in crimes like murder, robbery and rape. Only BJP could lead the state on the path of development and progress, he said. The BJP-led government at the Centre provided LPG connections to over two crore families, Shah added.
 
 Citing BJP's election manifesto, which claimed that there had been significant decline in cattle count in UP under the SP rule, he said if his party forms government, it would shut all slaughter houses and ensure that instead of “streams of blood“, those of milk and ghee flow.
 
 “There is an acute shortage of electricity , medicines and the common citizens, especially women and traders are feeling very much unsafe,“ he claimed, adding farmers are yet to get their dues from the state government.
 
 Mounting an attack on the SP-Congress alliance, he said, “It is quite amusing that one prince is giving tough times to his mother, the other to his fat her, and both are troubling UP.“ Seeking a performance re port from the Congress, Shah said, “Your (Rahul's) family has ruled the country for over 60 years. What has it done for the country? Rahul must answer this.“
 
 “Rahul asks what the Modi government has done for the country . Rahul Baba, the first thing that we have done is that we have given a PM who speaks. You had given a PM who did not speak for 10 years, and his voice was heard by you and your mother,“ he said.
