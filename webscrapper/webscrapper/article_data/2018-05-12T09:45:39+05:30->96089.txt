PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body will take action against people putting illegal advertisements on trees, and remove tree guards and paver blocks near the plants’ roots for their proper growth. 

 
 The commissioner of   ( ),  , gave these instructions to civic officials after meeting representatives of various social organizations, who sought the civic body’s help in tree conservation. 
 
 Hardikar said, “I have told the civic officials to lodge complaints against people nailing or hanging advertisements on trees. Notices will be sent and fines will be collected from them as per the rules. Tree guards are put around saplings to protect them from grazing animals but often they aren’t removed after the saplings grow into big trees, which restricts their growth.”
 
 The garden department officials have been told to accompany representatives of social organizations once a week during their drive for tree conservation.
 
 Representatives of Angholichi Goli, Federation of Senior Citizen Organizations of Pimpri Chinchwad, Police Nagrik Mitra, Pimpri Chinchwad Citizens’ Forum and other organizations met Hardikar.
 
 Suryakant Muthiyan, executive president, Federation of Senior Citizen Organizations of Pimpri Chinchwad, said, “Several social organizations have been conducting drives over the past two months in   and Shahunagar areas to remove nails used to put up advertisement boards on the trees. We have also removed the iron chains or wires used to hang advertisement boards.”
 
 He said paver blocks had been laid near the roots of trees on footpaths, which prevents water percolation. “We are conducting drives to remove the blocks and sought PCMC’s help,” he said.
