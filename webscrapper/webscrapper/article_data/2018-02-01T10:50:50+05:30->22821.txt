 "We missed out on a lot of things. We had to make lots of sacrifices. We had to learn to keep a lot of emotions in our hearts for one-and-a-half years in check. 
 
 "We had to be politically correct. The film had to go through a lot. But, today we feel vindicated," Shahid said.
 
 Shahid also quipped that the controversy surrounding the film had assumed such large proportions in the media that they did not need to promote the movie.

 "We are very, very happy and grateful. This country has always supported good films and that's what has happened. The love and result has been more than what I expected," he said. 
 
 Mira said 'Padmaavat' is one of Shahid's career-best performances. 
 
 "To play a character that does not have the support of many words is when your acting talent must really shine through. Shahid did just that with so much ease and you can see it onscreen," she said.
