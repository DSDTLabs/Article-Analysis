NEW DELHI: Having missed multiple deadlines, the country’s   municipal   at   is set for a March launch. Spread over 100 acres, the Rs 458-crore plant is the country’s biggest WTE plant and will cater to   and the Rohini zone.

 North corporation conceptualised the green project way back in 2012 and it was originally scheduled for inauguration in 2014. The WTE plant, which has two boilers, is capable of incinerating over 2,000 tonnes of   per day to generate 24MW energy, almost double the capacity of the existing two in the capital. 
 
 Developed by Ramky Group, a waste management company, through an agreement with the north corporation, the operational technology has been sourced from Chinese and American companies. “It is India’s first integrated WTE plant. We will inaugurate it in the first week of March,” north corporation standing committee chairman Parvesh Wahi said. Together, Civil Lines and the Rohini zone generate around 2,400 tonnes of municipal solid waste daily. “During trial run, one boiler produced 12MW of power,” said Abhay Ranjan, general manager, Ramky Group.
 
 Officials claimed that the plant will meet all environmental standards set by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The National Green Tribunal and the ministry of environment have given their go-ahead for the plant. 
 
 The company’s 1,000-strong sanitation workforce will collect garbage from door to door and transport it to the site where it will be segregated. “Currently, biodegradable waste that can be converted into useful compost is lost. The integrated plant will take care of this problem,” said an official. The electricity and the compost will be sold by the operating agency. Land for the project has been provided by the corporation. The project was delayed due to a dispute between the north corporation and Ramky Group over alleged violations of agreement. Work was resumed after NGT stepped in in December 2016.
