Quepem: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) chairman and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral assured the Adivasi Sangatna that a permanent venue for   festivals has been identified near the government college on the outskirts of the town.

 Cabral announced this during the inauguration of the seventh Tribal Festival organized by Quepem-based Sanghattna in coordination with the directorate of art and culture and tribal welfare department at Igramoll, Quepem.
 
 “The site is under the water resources department and people from the Adivasi Sangatna and tribals from Quepem taluka will be allowed to carry out and showcase their traditional activities at one place under one banner,” said Cabral.
 
 Cabral urged the tribal to formulate a home stay concept (traditionally known as mandd) at the permanent venue so that tribal people can display their traditional activities and can sell their traditional food items, agriculture instruments and other instruments.
