Kannur: Thirteen days after the murder of   worker UC  , at Peringadi near   Kalagramam in the district, the police team investigating the case arrested three   workers. This happened as the BJP was planning a protest campaign alleging the department’s failure in nabbing the killers. Police said the murder, which happened within   police limits, was an act of retaliation after CPM worker Kannippoyil   was killed earlier that night.

 A team led by Thalassery inspector KE Premachandran arrested three New Mahe residents – MM Shaji (36), Shibin Raveendran (27) and Lijin Chandran (27) – from a lodge in Vadakara on the night of May 18. Police said all three have a direct role in the murder, which came to the fore during interrogation.
 
 Police said Shibin and Lijin – who came to know about the murder of Babu – went and saw the body and then decided to exact revenge immediately. They went to New Mahe, where they met Shaji, who procured a sword.
 
 At that time Shamej – an auto driver who came that way – was waylaid and Shaji allegedly hacked him. Though Shamej ran away after ditching his vehicle, the trio chased him down and hacked him again. The three were brought to the crime scene as part of collecting evidence.
 
 Though police claim that Shamej’s was a political murder to avenge Babu’s killing, Puducherry police investigating the murder of Babu (in their jurisdiction in Mahe) said that a ‘long-standing enmity’ resulted in Babu’s murder. However, all the four arrested in this case are RSS workers.
 
 BJP-RSS leadership had alleged that the police probe was progressing slowly and hence the party was planning a campaign on Saturday when police recorded the  . Though a few people were questioned earlier, they were let off as they had no role in the killing.
 
 On May 7, CPM local leader Kannippoyil Babu was hacked to death at Palloor in Mahe and within minutes the retaliatory action followed in New Mahe where Shamej too was hacked to death.
