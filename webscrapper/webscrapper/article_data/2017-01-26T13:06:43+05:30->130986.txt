VADODARA: The fire services in the city operated by the   ( ) are set for a major change. The   is eyeing to integrate the fire services with the   by using premises of health centres.

 The VMC budget proposed on Monday states that it plans to take the fire services to the ward and urban health centre (UHC) level. The Command and   being established by the civic body at Badamdi Baug is also expected to work as the nerve centre of the fire services.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that sufficient space was available at the UHCs to have fire engines posted there along with fire personnel. The new UHCs have large compounds and sufficient room in their buildings too.
 
 The fire services will thus be decentralised and fire engines will be able to handle emergencies in much lower response time. Effectively, the VMC will have a series of smaller fire stations instead of the present system where only six fire stations exist across the city and fire engines have to travel long distances to douse fires.
 
 The Dandia Bazaar fire brigade headquarters may also have to make way for broader roads in the old city area. The VMC is planning to widen the roads from Sursagar to Akota-Dandia Bazaar crossroads as well as from Nagarwada to the R V Desai Road.
 
 An option being considered by the civic body is that of having a facility to park the fire engines and other vehicles handling emergences near Lakdi Pul. The place will be just a few paces away from Badamdi Baug where the fire brigadeâ€™s control room will come up.
