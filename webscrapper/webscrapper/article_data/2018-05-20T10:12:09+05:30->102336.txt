NAGPUR: Close on the heels of its success in the Gold Coast Commonewealth Games, the   squad is gearing up to extend its dream run in the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals which get underway in Bangkok on Sunday.

 
 The Indian men are determined to end the jinx and hoping to get fourth time lucky after they failed to make the knockout stage in the last three editions of biennial world team championships.

The last time India reached the playoffs was in 2010 in Malaysia.
 
 Besides world No. 9 Prannoy, the men’s team consists of B Sai Praneeth, Sameer Verma and Lakshya Sen in the singles. National champions Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy and the young duo of Shlok Ramchandran and MR Arjun will have to handle the task in doubles.
 
 India have been clubbed with Australia, France and the formidable China in Group A. The Prannoy-led side will face France in the opener on Sunday. The top two teams from each group qualify for the playoffs.
 
 In Uber Cup, the women’s team won two bronze medals in the last two tournaments. With senior shuttlers PV Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth being rested along with the main doubles pairs of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty as well as Ashwini Ponnappa and  , India have a depleted attack this time.
 
 The onus is on   and   to rise to the occasion and inspire their teammates to make the quarterfinal cut.
