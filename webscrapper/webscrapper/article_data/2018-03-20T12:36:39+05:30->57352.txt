PATNA: Bihar   ( ) chairman Anand   on Monday asked the district education officers (DEOs) to constitute a six-member supervising team for monitoring the evaluation of Matriculation (Class X) answer-sheets.

 In a letter, Kishor instructed the DEOs to rope in retired headmasters and senior teachers to supervise the evaluation process. “The idea behind the decision is to complete the evaluation process at the earliest. The team of supervisors has to ensure quality monitoring to lessen the chances of scrutiny later and avoid discrepancies in totalling. They will also make sure that there are no disruptions at the evaluation centres as it is our priority to publish the results on time,” the BSEB chief said on Monday.
 
 According to official sources, evaluation work is going on in Patna and is picking up the pace in other districts as well. The district magistrates and DEOs concerned have been asked to ensure that no untoward incident occurs and the work goes on smoothly.
 
 The evaluation work of Matric answer-sheets began from March 13 at 101 centres, including eight in Patna. Around 17.7 lakh candidates had appeared for the exams which were held from February 21 to 28 at altogether 1,426 centres across the state.
 
 “Only 10-12% answer-sheets of Class X have been corrected till now. At few centres like  , the evaluation work started on Monday,” a BSEB official told this reporter, adding earlier, the board had set March 22’s deadline for the work.
 
 The deadline of Intermediate answer-sheet evaluation has also been crossed. According to sources, only 50% copies have been corrected so far.
