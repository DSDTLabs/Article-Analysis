JAMSHEDPUR: As many as two lakh people of   (AMC) area is living amid stench from   for the past few days while   threatens the spread of vector-borne diseases. 

 The sanitation workers of the AMC have stopped lifting garbage from households in the absence of a dedicated dump yard.
 
 "There are 32 wards in the AMC limits and in each of the wards the situation is pathetic with overflowing dustbins lying uncleaned in the colonies and clogged drains for the past 15 days," said Arvind Kumar Mishra, a local resident and convenor of Ekta Vikas Manch.
 
 The AMC had identified a place in Kasidih in ward number 7 for dumping of waste but the sanitation workers stopped the lifting and dumping work after it faced opposition local residents. The AMC has put up dustbins in all the wards to collect 20 tonnes of waste every day.
 
 Residents have said that walking through the streets have become difficult due to unbearable stench from piled-up garbage. 
 
 "Since March this year we are confronting this situation as on two occasions in the past local residents had protested against dumping of the waste on forest land behind Manglam city and on railway land in Lanka Tola. This led to boycott of the lifting of garbage by the sanitary workers," informed Prem Singh, resident of LIG colony, Adityapur. 
 
 The AMC has deployed private agencies for the lifting work but confrontation between the sanitation workers and local residents have led to a halt in the garbage cleaning process.
