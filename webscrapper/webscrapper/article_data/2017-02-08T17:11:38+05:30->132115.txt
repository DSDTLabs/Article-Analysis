Hrithik Roshan’s ambitious film ‘Kaabil’ released on January 25 amidst much hype and hoopla. While Hrithik fans couldn’t wait to catch the movie and made a beeline for it, what made it all the more interesting was that the film was clashing at the box-office with Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘
 ’. Trade analysts were waiting with bated breath to see how the two movies fare amidst the clash.

 
  
 Well, the figures are finally out. Hrithik and Yami Gautam-starrer ‘Kaabil’ has collected Rs 10.43 crore on Day One. That’s a very encouraging number, especially considering that the film released on a weekday and did not enjoy the benefit of a holiday. Considering Thursday is a holiday on account of Republic Day, one can expect the numbers to shoot up dramatically. Combine that with the weekend and the film is expected to rake in the moolah.
  
 What works in the film’s favour is that the   production has garnered positive reviews. Hrithik’s portrayal of a visually-impaired man in particular has won appreciation across all quarters.
 
 
 ‘Kaabil’ is a full-fledged revenge drama that narrates the story of   (Hrithik) and Su ( ) who are visually challenged but it doesn’t stop them from living their life to the fullest. However, their world comes crashing down when a tragedy strikes them and Rohan takes it upon himself to seek revenge.
 
 
 
 While the film has taken a strong start, one will have to see whether ‘Kaabil’ will be able to make the most of the weekend.
