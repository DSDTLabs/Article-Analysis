GUNTUR: Guntur Municipal Corporation ( ) has finally identified land to construct an ultra-modern   in the city. The new slaughter house will come up on an extent of half an acre adjacent to the sewage treatment plant (STP) in  .

 “Shortage of GMC owned lands became a big headache when zeroing in on the slaughterhouse site. We will shortly handover the site to the engineering wing after taking the commissioner’s consent,” city planner S Chakrapani told TOI. Further, the engineering wing is ready with plans to kick-start the construction works.
 
 Although, the town planning wing had identified two to three sites, it had to backtrack following opposition from the locals. “As per the Supreme Court directive, we can’t take up any constructions in open and reserve sites earmarked in the master plan. So, it took time to identify a site,” said a senior GMC official. In the absence of a functional slaughterhouse, people were buying meat which was not checked by health wing officials. Hundreds of hotels depended on the unauthorised and unchecked meat.
 
 The need for the   slaughter house cropped up after the closure of the old and dilapidated abattoir located in Donkaroad area, following a directive issued by the   (NGT). Cutting of unhealthy, diseased animals is reportedly going on unchecked, and some retailers were also found supplying stale stocks to hotels and street food vendors. As per the rules, no diseased animal should be cut and put up for sale for public consumption.
 
 More than 400 to 500 vendors are selling sheep meat in the city. While the sale is greater on all Sundays, most of the stalls remain open even during other days as the city has a high percentage of non-vegetarians. Sources said that at least 3,000 to 5,000 sheep are cut on Sundays, while around 1,000 are cut on the other days.
