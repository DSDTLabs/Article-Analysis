MUMBAI: Less than a couple of years after two accused persons who had been brought to the sessions court for a hearing brazenly attacked the cop escorting them, a magistrate's court has sentenced them to one year and five months in jail. The accused persons assaulted the escorting cop as he did not let them have lunch brought by a family member as they had not sought the court's permission. 

  The two accused-Parvez Khan (29) and   (24)-had been lodged in   jail after being arrested in another case. The court refused to release the accused persons on a bond of good behaviour. The magistrate stated that such a "fleet bite sentence" could not be awarded. 
 
 "Considering the nature of the offence, this court is not inclined to release the accused persons as per the provisions of Probation of Offenders Act at the first place, as such type of offences are a jolt to the consciousness of the society, specifically, the way the accused have treated the complainant who is a public servant and a policeman," the magistrate said last week.
 
 The incident took place on August 31, 2016. The court relied on the statement of the victim cop and another cop to find he accused guilty. The victim, Dhananjay More, told the court that at the time of incident he was an assistant police inspector who had been assigned the duty to accompany the accused from Arthur Road jail to courts concerned to attend proceedings. The cop further told the court that on the day of the incident, around 11.15 am, he had produced the accused in courtroom 16 housed at the city sessions court. He said that around 1.45 pm, the matter of the accused was called by the court and the next date was fixed. The witness recalled that when accused Khan told him he wanted to have lunch brought by his family members who were outside the court, he turned down the request as permission for this had not been granted by the court.
