LUDHIANA: Worried over the slow pace of recovery of property tax, MC officials have decided to request the   local bodies department additional chief secretary to reduce the annual target for collecting the levy. While the state government had set a Rs 100-crore target for the MC to collect property tax this year, the civic body could collect only Rs 59 crore to date. 

  Jaskiran Singh said it was due to the tax waiver scheme announced by the government that they could recover only half of the pending amount. "Also, not many people cleared their dues. So, we will request the local bodies department to cut some of our targets," he said. 
 
 A source in the civic body said it was unlikely that officials would be able to recover the entire Rs 100 crore by the end of this financial year, as only the month of March was left for collections. The officials claimed that since the government announced the tax waiver scheme, they could not impose penalty on defaulters and had to give another 10% rebate on the tax.
