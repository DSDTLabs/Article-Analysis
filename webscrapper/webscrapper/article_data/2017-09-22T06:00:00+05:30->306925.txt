Kolkata: Nine volunteers, including a Buddhist, died on Thursday when a truck carrying aid to   refugees in Chakdala from Naikhongchari in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh turned turtle. 

 The incident comes at a time when persecution of Rohingyas continues in Myanmar at the hands of armed forces and a section of the Buddhist population.
 
 “One of the victims, Arabinda Barua, was a Buddhist. He had decided to join the volunteers and had been taking relief materials to different camps over the past few weeks,” said Taslim Ahmed Chowdhury, chairman of Naikhongchari Sadar Union Parishad. 
 
 The truck carrying relief material from International Committee of the Red Cross started from Naikhongchari area on the southern fringes of Cox’s Bazar.
 
 “The truck veered off and turned turtle. Nine persons died on the spot, while 10 were injured. They were rushed to hospital and are undergoing treatment,” Chowdhury said. 
 
 According to sources in International Committee of the Red Cross, the truck was carrying supplies for around 500 Rohingya families in Chakdala area.
 
 “Many aid workers who have joined hands in the relief work are Buddhist. There are some Buddhists in the Naikhongchari area who are working in the local camps. They are saddened by what is happening in Myanmar,” Chowdhury added.
