Jaipur: A 17-year-old girl studying in class IX of a private school was allegedly gang-raped by three persons at Ghad police station area near Deoli in Tonk district of the state. The girl was raped almost three months ago but she kept mum as the accused had threatened to kill her brother. However, while her mother noticed some physical changes in her and she became pregnant, the family breaking the silence lodged an FIR at Ghad police station late on Saturday evening. The accused are on the run and efforts were on to arrest them. According to the police, the rape survivor was raped almost three months ago by three persons. After the rape the accused threatened that if she will speak about it to anyone they will eliminate her brother.

 “She kept mum out of fear initially. However, when her mother started seeing some physical changes in her and the girl became pregnant, the family decided to lodge an FIR. We have lodged a case under appropriate sections of IPC and POCSO Act. Also the girl was sent for the medical examination,” said Narendra Mohan, additional SP, Tonk and in-charge circle officer, Deoli.
 
 Police have also sought the age certificate of the girl for investigations. “All the three accused are on the run and teams have been constituted to arrest them. They are on our radar and our men are soon going to arrest them,” he added.
 
 Asked if police will also add the appropriate section of criminal intimidation against the accused, a senior officer, said, “That is part of the investigation. If we will get proper evidence on the allegation that girl was intimidated by the accused, these sections would also be added in the FIR.”
