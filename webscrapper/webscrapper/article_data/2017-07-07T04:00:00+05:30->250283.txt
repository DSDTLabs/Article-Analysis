Ahmedabad: The Admission Committee for Professional Courses (ACPC) has cautioned students from taking admission under NRI quota at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT).

 According to ACPC, there is no NRI quota in the institute and those admitted as NRI or NRI-sponsored candidate will not be recognized by the government or ACPC.
 
 Last year also the government had alerted students against taking admission in Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU) and DA-IICT under NRI quota. The ACPC had said that both the institutes admitted students under NRI quota though they were not authorized to. Later, PDPU took permission from the government but the DA-IICT could not. According to ACPC officials, the practice continued at DA-IICT as the government failed to take any action.
 
 DA-IICT has 300 seats of which 150 are filled by ACPC and the rest from students clearing JEE main on all-India basis. Sources said that 10% of the remaining 150 seats are reserved for NRI students, which is illegal.
