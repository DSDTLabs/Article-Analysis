CHENNAI: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Chennai (north) has directed   to pay a sum of Rs1.55 lakh to three passengers for a   cancelled at the last moment more than three years ago. 

 In their petition, Basheer Ahmed of Chennai, state president of the  , T M  , a retired professor from   and advocate E Sarwar Khan from Tindivanam contended that they were to travel from New Delhi to Chennai in a SpiceJet flight on December 16, 2014. While they were at the airport three hours before the scheduled take off at 10.45am, the flight was cancelled at the last minute and they came to know of it only through a notice board. “There were no alternate arrangements. We immediately booked tickets on another flight that was much costlier,” their petition stated.
 
 In a reply, the airlines contended that the flight was cancelled on account of a sudden technical snag which was beyond their control and hence no liability fastened against them. “We intimated the passengers about the  . The passengers were given an option to either get the full refund or to take an alternate flight, which was on the next day at the same time,” read the reply.
 
 In the judgement, the forum bench comprising president K Jayabalan and member M Uyirroli Kannan observed that no prudent man would wait for 24 hours to catch a flight and that the airline should have tried to accommodate passengers on a flight in any other airline. The forum further observed that the trio suffered mental agony due to the cancellation of the flight and directed the company to refund Rs1 lakh they spend on executive class flight tickets in another airline and also a   of Rs55,000 for causing mental agony.
