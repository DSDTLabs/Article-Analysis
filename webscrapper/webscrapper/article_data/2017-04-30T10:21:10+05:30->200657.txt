AHMEDABAD: Police informer Altaf Basi alias Batli, wanted for the shooting near   in Gomtipur, continues to evade arrest. This has made the police issue a look-out notice for Basi, Ishaq Ansari, and his nephews Raju and   and Kayeem Ansari, at the airport, railway stations and bus depots in the city.

 Basi allegedly ordered the shooting in which one Sadik Shaikh was killed and his brother,  , was grievously wounded. 
 
 Sources in the police said Arif’s condition continues to be critical. He is being treated at the VS Hospital. Arif now fears for his life as he thinks Basi would also kill him as he is an eyewitness of the shooting. His family members have approached the local police for additional security at the hospital. The sources said that late on Saturday night, the crime branch had detained one of the accused.
 
 Meanwhile, a police team raided the house of Basi’s second wife in Shahpur. Police said they had accurate information that Basi’s hideout was his second wife’s house. “But he had left the house just minutes before we reached. The lights and fans in the house were still on,” a police officer said.
 
 It may be recalled that Basi is the younger brother of listed bootlegger, Zafar alias Batli, of Rakhial. When the police reached his house in Rakhial, even his family members, including his first wife, were not aware of his second marriage with a Shahpur woman.
 
 Police commissioner AK Singh said a line has to be drawn between an informer and a criminal. “We have taken the incident very seriously and will be able to nab Basi very soon. Crime branch has been directed to nab all the accused at the earliest,” Singh said.
