Pune: Sanjay Taksande, Pune regional director of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), on Tuesday gave directives that disrupting of power supply of domestic, commercial and industrial power consumers must be continued and on-site inspection of consumers having monthly consumption up to 50 units must be undertaken for verification. He said 100% recovery of current bills is necessary along with the recovery of arrears. The work in Pune zone of recovery of arrears of domestic, commercial and industrial consumers is not satisfactory.  Taksande warned that if there is negligence in turning off power supply for recovery off arrears then action will be taken against the senior officer along with the local official and employees. On-site verification of power meters should be conducted of consumers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad whose meters are in a good condition but consumption is zero or up to 50 units.  There is a loss of revenue of MSEDCL if there is less consumption when the power meter is working, Taksande said.
