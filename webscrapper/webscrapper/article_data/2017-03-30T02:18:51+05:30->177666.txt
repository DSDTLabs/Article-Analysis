MUMBAI: The city’s oldest museum,   in  , will be taken over by   next year, civic commissioner   announced in the budget on Wednesday. 

 The proposal comes against the background of allegations last year of 'administrative lapses' by the museum’s management and that standard prescribed practices were not being followed. There were also allegations that the museum trust wanted to convert a playground adjoining the museum into a parking lot. The trust had denied the allegations. 
 
 The museum is owned by BMC and in 2003, it entered into a tripartite agreement of of 15 years for its restoration with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) and Jamanalal Bajaj Foundation. Under the agreement, a 19-member Dr Bhau Daji Lad museum trust was set up to manage its affairs. The agreement expires in 2018. The municipal chief said the BMC proposes to revoke the agreement and take charge of the museum. 
 
 Mehta also announced Rs 2.5 crore for the textile museum at Kalachowky. The museum is expected to be an interactive space that will give hands-on experience to students in sculpting, pottery and other art forms.
