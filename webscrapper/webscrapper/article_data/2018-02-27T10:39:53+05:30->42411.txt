KANNUR: Senior   leader K  , who has been fasting since February 19, will end his strike on Tuesday, as per the instructions of the party leadership, in the backdrop of the decision of the UDF meeting to intensify the campaign for CBI probe into the murder of   worker   SP.

 “I did not expect any justice from the government while starting the agitation, because we cannot expect it from the leaders who chop humans into pieces, but my aim was to expose their state of mind,” said Sudhakaran. “Let those who have eyes see this and those who have ears hear it.”
 
 
 He said he was sure the government would oppose to the CBI inquiry because only those who have sensitivity towards humanity can understand others.
 
 If the present inquiry is impartial and the CPM leadership has no role in the murder, then why the government is afraid of a CBI probe, he asked.
 
 The decision to end the hunger strike does not mean that the campaign for justice has ended, DCC president Satheesan Pacheni said.
 
 “It was because of our campaign that there was at least some progress in the investigation and arrest, though the investigating team has not touched upon the conspiracy. We have to expose the conspiracy behind the murder. So the campaign will be intensified, and it will be taken up by the UDF,” Pacheni said.
 
 Sudhakaran will end his strike on Tuesday afternoon, and it will be followed by a mass rally, in which senior leaders, including Oommen Chandy and Vayalar Ravi, are expected to participate.
