Mysuru: A major attraction in Mysuru is the   or horse-drawn carriage in which tourists take a ride around the heritage sites. With   around the corner, tonga owners are preparing for more tourists and are busy decorating their horses and carriages. Tonga owners say that the state tourism department has stopped Dasara grants to them, a charge that department officials deny.

 Tonga owners say they start preparations for Dasara a month in advance. “Our daily earnings peak during Dasara as more tourists visit at this time. We usually undertake annual maintenance of the tongas before the season,” said Rafik Ulla, a tonga owner. “We spend Rs5,000 to Rs10,000 on repairs and alterations. Tourists prefer attractive tongas with healthy horses,” he said.
 
 Munnath Pasha, who has a garage in Lashkar Mohalla, said tonga owners make alterations to the carriage to give them attractive roof designs and soft seats. “As tourist inflow is high during Dasara, the tonga owners invest in their carriages before this season to attract tourists,” he said.
 
 This year, tonga owners are upset that the state tourism department has not released grants to them for Dasara. “Tongas are a major attraction in Mysuru. Just like the government releases money to clean and decorate historical sites, it must release money to tonga owners,” said Dharmesh Muttanna, a tonga driver and a resident of H D Kote.
 
 Tourism department deputy director H P Janardhan said the state government released grants to them three years ago but they had not formed an association as they were asked to. “If they form an association with bylaws and approach us, we can release grant. We can’t release the money without an organisation. Who is responsible if someone misuses the government grant,” he said.
