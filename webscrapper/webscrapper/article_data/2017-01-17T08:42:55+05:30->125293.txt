HYDERABAD: A bullet, which entered the liver of a Somalian national during a   nine months ago, was successfully removed by city doctors last week. The doctors at the   performed a minimally invasive surgery in just 45 minutes.

 Mahmud, 50, was caught in a crossfire in Somalia last year and was accidentally hit by a stray bullet. Medical help looked elusive for nine months, till he landed up in the city . Led by  , consultant  , Apollo Hospital, Jubilee Hills, the team of doctors found a 5x2 cm size bullet entrenched inside his liver upon evaluation.
 
 “In his country , doctors advised surgical removal of the bullet through the conventional open surgery . But he was reluctant to proceed as it involved cutting open of the abdomen and slicing a part of the liver. So it was considered risky . Hence, we performed a critical laparosco pic surgery to retrieve the bullet with minimal damage to the liver,“ explained Dr Siva Charan Reddy .
 
 Explaining the technique, he said that they made two small holes of 0.5 cm in the abdomen and with the help of specialised instruments, the exact location of the bullet was identified. It was then removed carefully , preserving the liver and surrounding organs.
 
 “The surgery was done with very minimal blood loss, left no scars and the patient was discharged within 24 hours. The conventional or open surgery would have left a large scar of about 15 ­ 20 cms in length and post-operative recovery would have taken about over a week to ten days,“ added Dr Siva Charan Reddy . The patient left India after having been discharged last week.
