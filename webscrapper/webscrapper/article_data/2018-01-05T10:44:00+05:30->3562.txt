THANJAVUR: In a vicious late night murder on Wednesday, four inmates of a   centre in Thanjavur smothered its nightwatchman to death before falling into the police net hours later.

 The police said Jothi  , 45, of Ammapettai, had been working as a watchman at the de-addiction centre located at  , near Vallam, in Thanjavur, over the past many years.
 
 Run by doctor  , the centre has 80 patients including accused Arun Balaji, 22, of Uranipuram, Ajithkumar, 20, of Ariyalur, Karthi alias Bhagyanathan, 38, of Karaikal and a 17- year- old boy, hailing from Ayyampettai. Police said that Ramalingam and the inmates had developed a decent relationship as he used to take them out for recreational activities. However, he was forced to not take them out due to his busy schedule at centre for the past few days.
 
 Police said that the four accused, apparently upset over this, have been asking Ramalingam to let them out since Thursday morning, which he did not agree. Angry over this, the four inmates decided to kill him. After Jothi went to bed in his room, the accused went to Ramalingamâ€™s room, tied him up to bedframe, smothered him with a pillow and fled the scene without anyone noticing the attack. 
 
 Moments later, while on his way to the centre for the routine round-up at 3 am, owner Radhakrishnan noticed four of his patients standing at the new bus stand in Vallam. On being questioned by the doctor, the inmates told him that they have escaped from the centre and were waiting for the bus for home. Radhakrishnan, however, took them to centre where he found out that the four had killed his nightwatchman and been fleeing from the scene. He called in the police.
