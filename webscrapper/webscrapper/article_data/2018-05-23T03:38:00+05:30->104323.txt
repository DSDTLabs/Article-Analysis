Panaji: The Congress party on Tuesday kicked off their state-wide programme ‘Jana Gana Mana Noman Tuka Goykara’ to meet people and understand their problems. Congress members were seen using public transport to travel from Panaji to Mapusa and stated they would use public transport to travel around the state. “Instead of the public coming and meeting Congress office-bearers, GPCC president Girish Chodankar, leader of opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar and senior office-bearers will go to the people and address their grievances. During the last six years of the BJP’s tenure, Goans have been facing a lot of problems. The Congress high command will be at the people’s doorsteps,” AICC secretary and Goa desk in-charge A Chella Kumar said. “This government has not been able to deliver any solution for people affected by the mining ban. Though they’re in power in Delhi, they are not able to convince the central government to restart mining activities,” Kumar said. Calling it is a unique program, Chodankar said that instead of giving speeches, they would listen to the problems of the people. They will proceed to Cortalim, Vasco, Mormugao and Dabolim on Wednesday morning and hold a booth convention in Margao in the evening.
