  : The country's sixth Regional   (RIE) is set to come up in Tripura, providing a much-needed boost to the education sector by providing research opportunities and training teachers. It will be the region's second RIE. 

 State education minister Ratan Lal Nath said, "The Union human resource development ministry has sanctioned the RIE after making the   (IIIT) operational at NIT-Agartala this session." The Tripura government will provide 50 acres of land to set up the institute, which functions under the aegis of the   and Training (NCERT). At present, an RIE in   caters to the eight northeastern states, half of which will come under the institute once it comes up.
