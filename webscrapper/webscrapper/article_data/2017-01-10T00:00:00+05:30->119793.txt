Though the Prime Minister checked into the hotel only after midnight, his day started sharp at 6 am with a cup of ginger tea. His breakfast, at 7.30 am, consisted of Idly, Plain Dosa and Vegetable Upma, which were served with Chinna Vengaya Sambar and five varieties of chutney. The breakfast spread also included mixed vegetable parantha with curd and pickle, seasonal fruits, carrot juice and ginger tea.
 A spokesperson from the hotel said, “He really liked the Dosa, and complimented us on the food. Every hotel tries to give him a variety of Gujarati dishes wherever he goes, but his team had informed us earlier that he likes to try local food. We are glad we got 
 to give him a taste of South Indian cuisine.”
