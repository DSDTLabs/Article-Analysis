NAGPUR: The incident of ink attack on   and ex-chief minister Ashok Chavan took a curious turn on Monday. In its report on the incident, the city Congress has said the perpetrator of the attack Lalit Bagle (Yadav) was not connected to the Congress party but was associated with the   Sanghatana.

 Interestingly, the Mathadi body is a labour union and it is well known fact its is controlled for last several decades by former minister and Congress stalwart Satish Chaturvedi. While disowning Bagle, Congress officially linked him to the Mathadi Sanghatana makes it clear the party city unit now dominated by the Muttemwar faction is pointing finger at Chaturvedi.
 
 Giving the whole episode another twist, a little known Ahir-Yadav Samaj sent a press statement along with a photograph in which Bagle is presenting a memento to Muttemwar. The picture is of January 26 and is of Vidarbha Mathadi Kamgar Sanghatana’s Republic Day function. Bagle is presenting a ‘tulsi’ plant to Muttemwar in presence of Chaturvedi.
 
 Arguably the picture could have been of the days when Muttemwar and Chaturvedi had buried their differences two years ago. But their bonhomie barely lasted a year during which they even visited London along with families and spent a few days together in a rented apartment with spouses doling out home-made food.
 
 Late last year, factions led by Nitin Raut, Chaturvedi and Muttemwar again fell out each seeking dominance in local politics. 
 
 The statement of the City Congress signed by vice-president Gajraj Hatewar says action has been sought against those ‘behind the incident.’ Copies of the report have been sent to   vice-president and   in charge of Maharashtra Mohan Prakash.
