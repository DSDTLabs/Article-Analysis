MUMBAI: A week after the row over a controversial video on river conservation,   on Saturday demanded CM  's resignation besides disciplinary action against top bureaucrats and police brass. The CMO rejected the demand, saying all charges are baseless. The video on river conservation was prepared by an NGO. 

 Congress spokesperson   said Fadnavis should quit while action should be taken against IAS and IPS officers who participated in the video, for violation of   (discipline & conduct) rules.
 
 Sawant said that as per the discipline and conduct rules, no officer can participate in an event, video, sponsored programme or television show without the state government's permission . 
 
 Fadnavishad refuted Sawant's allegations, saying, the video was for a public cause, for conservation of four rivers in Mumbai. The CM's office had described charges made by Sawant as being politically motivated. "It was unfortunate that the entire issue has been politicized," the CMO had stated.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson   reacted sharply on Sawant's demand, saying, he will bring a breach of privilege notice against him for defaming the CM and making baseless allegations.
