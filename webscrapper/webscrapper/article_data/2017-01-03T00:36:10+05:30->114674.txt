JAMMU: The   was disrupted twice during a joint session of the Jammu & Kashmir legislature on Monday, when members of the opposition from National Conference (NC) and   shouted anti-government slogans while it was being played. The uproar over the unrest that left several dead in the Valley last summer, also caused the J&K governor to cut short his address. 

 The disruption of national anthem is construed as disrespect by law. The opposition members on Monday created a ruckus when the anthem was played. Soon after J&K governor N N Vohra began his address, NC and Congress members raised slogans and climbed their desks with placards in hand to protest against the government. The placards read, “Revoke PSA (the controversial public safety Act)”, “Stop killings in Kashmir”, and “Where is political dialogue?” 
 Independent MLA Engineer Abdul Rashid protested as well. 
 
 Owing to the chaotic situation, the governor was compelled to abruptly end his speech after 12 minutes. National Conference legislator Basheer Veeri was seen wearing a black jacket to protest against alleged human rights violations in the Valley. The opposition members justified the disrespect of the national anthem by saying that they were provoked by the treasury benches.
