Thiruvananthapuram: The newly-built   was opened for traffic recently, which was welcomed by many regular commuters in the region. But   and local residents allege that the works have disrupted the normal flow of water in the lake.  , which was dumped for the construction works, is yet to be removed.

 The new bridge was constructed parallel to the Old   Bridge as part of widening of the Kazhakoottam-Mukkola stretch.
 
 Though   had claimed that their activities won’t disrupt normal flow of water in the lake, the works have invited protest from all sides. 
 
 Inland navigation wing of the irrigation department has already sent notices to NHAI to clear the mud from the place. Incidentally, the bund formed in the lake during the construction of the Old Akkulam Bridge is yet to be removed from the site. The irrigation department found this during an inspection to find out the causes for flooding in the city.
 
 “Water from the northern part of the city is collected in Amaizhanchan canal, which will reach Akkulam and then flows to the sea at Veli. It was found that water is not flowing towards the sea, resulting in flooding during rainy season. The mud deposit at Akkulam is the reason for this. We have asked both PWD and NHAI to clear the mud,” said an official.
 
 Sources close to NHAI said that they have made arrangements to clear the mud from the portion of lake and would restore it to its original shape. 
 
 Meanwhile, NHAI has closed the old bridge as it has to complete construction of underpasses on both ends of the bridge. It will be opened for traffic by the end of January, according to sources.
 
 The works to construct underpasses at the Kazhakkoottam side of the bridge and at Kovalam side are expected to be completed in around two weeks.
