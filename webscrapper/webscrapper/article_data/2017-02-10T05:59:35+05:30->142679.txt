SURAT: Students of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) will now be under watch of a team belonging to different faculties which will ensure that they never   under any circumstances. Three students have ended their lives in their   on   since April 2016. 

 The reason why two students committed suicide is yet not known while Chirag Agarwal, a first year Bachelor of Technology student found dead on Wednesday, was suffering from migraine. He had complained of continuous headache to his friends in the institute, sources informed. He has also mentioned in suicide note his liking for a girl since his school days. 
 
 Urvashi Gaikwad, 20, an MSc student, hanged self in her hostel room in April 2016 while Kancham Shanmukha Reddy, 20, hanged self in a bathroom in August 2016. 
 
 “If the problem mentioned by the student in the suicide note is true, then some psychological help would have stopped him from taking this step. It is sad that three students killed themselves here in the past one year,” a faculty member said.
 
 At least 4,500 students study and live on the campus of SVNIT which is spread over 250 acres on Dumas Road in the Diamond City. It is one of the top engineering colleges of the country. Students take admission in the institute as per merit on the basis of marks in JEE. Until now there is no arrangement to provide counselling to stressed out students. 
 
 “Students can approach the proposed team and take its advice on anything. If a student does not come to us on his or her own, we will try to identify those suffering from depression and help them out,” SVNIT director S R Gandhi said.
 
 “If we are unable to help a student, we will work out something to ensure that he or she gets the required medical assistance from outside. We will make all efforts to see no harm comes our students’ way,” Gandhi added.
