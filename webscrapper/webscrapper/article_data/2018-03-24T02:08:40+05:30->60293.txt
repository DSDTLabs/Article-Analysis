GURUGRAM: In the first phase of bidding for   licences for retail composite vends held on March 14 and 15, the   state excise and taxation department has cancelled licenses for 42 zones for which bidding was held statewide. 

 Of these, 16 are in Gurugram West (out of 22 in total) and 11 in Gurugram East (out of 19 in total). Officials said revenue from the bids fell from last year’s., promoting the move. 
 
 According to a senior excise official, despite Supreme Court’s ban on sale of liquor within 500m of highways, last year’s bids were higher than the year before. This year in comparison, even though the Supreme Court has removed the 500m restriction within city limits, bids for both Gurugram and Faridabad have fallen.
 
 “The deputy excise and taxation commissioner recommended fresh bidding as this year’s bids were lower than last year’s,” said excise collector Yogesh Kumar.
 
 Officials said it’s possible bidders have formed cartels to force lower bids. “Even though we used e-bidding, bids fell by 4% in Gurugram and by 2% in Faridabad,” an official said, adding both are revenue districts and have consistently shown positive growth. A second round of bidding for two Gurugram zones — one in each district — which didn’t receive any bids in the first round, was also held on Fri
