MUMBA: In its fourth status report filed by the   (CoA), which will be presented to the Supreme Court on July 14, the committee led by ex-CAG   have come down heavily on the members of the board for not complying with the order of the country's highest judicial bench.

 "Whilst disqualified persons have been forced to demit office pursuant to the aforesaid order (Jan 2), they continue to remain associated with their respective state units in different capacities and are able to procure nomination as representatives to the SGM...such disqualified persons are effectively able to do indirectly what they have been prohibited by the SC from doing directly," the status report says.
 
 It is a direct reference to former   and   (TNCA) president   who attended the SGM held on June 26 in Mumbai as member of the association's executive committee in his capacity as a representative of Perambalur District Cricket Association.
 
 "Such disqualified members have vested interests in stalling the implementation of the SC judgment," the status report further said.
 
 The CoA has asked the SC to appoint an ombudsman only after which rules regarding conflict of interest in cricket can be laid out.
 
 And, it has come down heavily on BCCI treasurer   and said he remained a "mute spectator, lacking courage or conviction to speak in favour of implementation of reforms".
