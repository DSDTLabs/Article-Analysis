JAIPUR: Mukesh Sharma was 12 years old when his father, a labourer, disappeared from their residence in the pink city nearly 36 years ago. Mukesh and his elder brother hoped he would return one day, but just when they had painfully concluded that their father was no more, they heard from the police that   was lodged in a Pakistani jail.

 “For years we waited but later lost all hope and thought that he was no more. Recently police officials approached our family to confirm his nationality and informed that he was lodged in a Pakistan jail,” the resident of city's   area said. Jaipur Rural SP Rameshwar Singh said they had received an inquiry on May 1 from the police headquarters about Gajanand Sharma, who is believed to be lodged in a Pakistani jail.
 
 “We wrote to all police stations to verify his nationality and details of the family... We have submitted our report to the headquarters,” he said.
 
  They had traced his family's roots in   village falling under   police station and later found that the family had moved to Brahmpuri area in Jaipur nearly 50 years ago. PTI
