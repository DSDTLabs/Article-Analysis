AHMEDABAD: To protest against the recent rape horrors in the country, various Muslim and Dalit organizations will come together to hold the   on Monday evening. These organizations include Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch (RDAM) led by Jignesh Mevani, Alpsankhyak Adhikar Manch, Dalit Muslim Ekta Manch, and Hamari Avaaz Hamara Adhikar forum. The rally is likely to turn massive as the organizers started spreading the word on various social media platforms. People from across the state are likely to participate in the rally.

 Jignesh Mevani, independent MLA from Vadgam and convener of RDAM, said that the public rally was the need of the hour because Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders of the ruling BJP were silent over the horrors.
 
 “The call was given by members of my group, which with other forums, has spoken against the recent rape cases in Kathua in Jammu & Kashmir, Unnao in Uttar Pradesh, and Surat in Gujarat,” Mevani said. “Shockingly, the BJP is either ruling or is in alliance in those states. This speaks volumes about the deteriorating law and order situation in the BJP-ruled states. So we will hold a rally to wake up the sleeping government.” 
 
 Kaleem Siddiqui of Dalit-Muslim Ekta Manch said that the rally is an attempt to show unity between Muslims and Dalits. “Every moment of each passing day, someone somewhere is holding a protest against the horrors,” said Siddiqui. He said that a march will be organized from Namaste Circle in Shahibaug to RTO circle. “People are registering their protest through candlelight marches and with slogans against the regime,” he said. “It has become necessary to give expression to this akrosh (anger).”
 
 Meanwhile members of RDAM sat on a day’s fast in Danilimda area of the city. Dixit Parmar of RDAM said that around 80 members sat on a fast at Ambedkar Hall on Sunday.
