PANAJI: The Centre’s funds for Goa to reduce poverty among  , provide finance for self-help groups,  , housing and skill development continue to remain on paper. Of the Rs 113.5crore allocated to the state since 2014, a mere Rs 85 lakh has trickled into the state treasury.

 In fact, in 2015-16, of the Rs 3.4 crore sanctioned, not a single rupee was deposited into the state’s coffers, data released by the Union government on the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) indicates.
 
 A statement showing funds allocated, released and utilized under DAY NULM during 2014‐15 to 2016‐17 shows that the highest allocation for Goa was in 2014-15 financial year—Rs 109.3 crore. But during that period, only Rs 62.1 lakh made its way to Goa.
 
 In 2016-17, Rs 81.97 lakh was allocated for Goa of which just over a quarter, Rs 23.27 lakh to be exact, was released for Goa.
 
 The data clearly shows that the quantum of funds allocated for Goa has continued to dwindle since 2014-15.
 
 “We find it very difficult to find people who are interested in these schemes. The most important programme, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which aims for housing for all, has no takers in places like Panaji because the property must be in the person’s name. In other municipalities, we have got some response,” an official with   said.
 
 According to the Union government’s data, five self-help groups (SHG) were formed in Goa in 2016-17, while 41 SHGs got funding from the central government under the DAY NULM scheme.
 
 The data also shows that 583 Goans gained employment through skills training and placement programme in 2016-17. The figures for the previous years are negligible.
