NOIDA: The national human rights commission has sought a detailed report from the UP director-general of police in four weeks on the alleged detention and torture of a 14-year-old girl at   police outpost for three days.

 
 The commission has taken   cognizance of media articles and observed that the contents of the articles, if true, indicate  , for which they deserve exemplary punishment. “The law does not empower police personnel to humiliate and harm innocent citizens,” it said.
 
 The girl’s family had alleged she had gone to work as a domestic help in a flat in Sector 46 after her mother fell ill. When her employers noticed some jewellery missing at the house, they lodged a police complaint against the girl.
