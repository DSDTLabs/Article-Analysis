Nagpur: “Dnyaneshwar was not only a saint but a poet, an intellectual and a spiritual leader. His work of translating Bhagwad Gita into Marathi way back in the 12th century was path-breaking as it helped common people understand Gita,” said Vivek Ghalsasi, a noted thinker, on Friday.

 Delivering a lecture on ‘Bhasha ani vidnyan nishtha Dnyaneshwar’, organized by Granth Sahavas of Vidarbha Sahitya Sammelan as part of ‘Deep Lavila Jana’ programme, Ghalsasi said that Dnyaneshwar opened the gate of knowledge for Marathi people by writing Dnyaneshwari as Bhagwad Gita was accessible only to those who knew Sanskrit. 
 
 Ghalsasi threw light on Dnyaneshwar’s life and said that his writings are relevant even today. Today, people want facts to prove a point. Dnyaneshwar’s writings are based on science which can be seen in his literature, including Dnyaneshwari and Amrutanubhav, he added. Today, Dnyaneshwar is regarded as one of the greatest as well as the most difficult philosopher minds of India,” he said.
 
 Retired bank officer Shashank Khare, a regular visitor to the library, said that Ghalsasi made difficult parts of Dnyaneshwari so simple in his discourse that it could be understood by a common man. 
 
 Ghalsasi said, “It was difficult for me to exactly choose a topic to discuss on Dnyaneshwar’s life. He was so talented that it was very hard to explain his contribution in detail in a short span of time.”
