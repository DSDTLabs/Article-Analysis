CHANDIGARH: The court of civil judge Harleen Pal gave a dressing down to the SHO of Sector 36 police station, inspector  , on Saturday for supplying an incomplete copy of the chargesheet to the defence lawyer in the November 2017 autorickshaw gang rape case.

 While the charge sheet is 372 pages long, the document police handed over to the defence counsel has more than 100 pages less, the lawyer had claimed in court. The court directed the SHO to supply the full copy of the charge sheet by the next hearing of the case on April 18. The court also observed that it had become “routine” for police to hand over incomplete chargesheets to defence lawyers. The judge said this was not acceptable and was also delaying trial of cases.
 
 Police had submitted the charge sheet to the court on February 21. The SHO had to face the court’s ire after defence counsel   argued pages were missing in the charge sheet, and these included details of the identification parade, copy of the FIR, blood-sample report, and arrest memo.
 
 The accused — auto-rickshaw driver  , friends   and   — had, on November 17, allegedly stopped the threewheeler in a secluded location in Sector 53, dragged the lone woman passenger, aged 21, into the nearby bushes, and gang-raped her. The court also directed the investigating officer of the case to be present before it during the next hearing.
 
 The officer is on leave at present. The court then summoned the SHO and told him that defence and prosecution counsels, both, had a right on getting the full copy of the chargesheet.
 
 The charge sheet includes 27 witness and has sought that the accused be tried under sections 376D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The witness includes statements of the rape survivor, the gynaecologist who medically examined her, and the constable who oversaw the identification parade of the accused.
 
 The accused had gone to the petrol pump before they allegedly raped the woman.
