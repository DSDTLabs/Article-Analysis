JAIPUR: Two   suffered injuries when a   in   exploded in Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital on Monday morning.

 The two injured lab technicians are at a high risk of getting infected with serious diseases as at the time of explosion there were 116 blood samples in the centrifuge machine. With the blast, the blood samples too came out of the machine with a force. These samples were in the process of being tested but nobody knows what kind of infection or viruses these blood samples contained.
 
 Centrifuge is a machine which is used for the separation of fluids, based on density— serum and white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The explosion created panic in the hospital as it made a loud noise. The patients along with doctors came out of their wards in fear but when they came to know about the explosion in machine, they calmed down.
 
 It is not the first such incident in the laboratory. Recently, an incubator had caught fire. Fortunately in that incident no one was hurt. Two lab technicians suffered serious injuries— one lab technicians suffered fracture in mandible, or lower jaw while other suffered fracture in hand. “They will undergo surgery,” said Dr SS Yadav, spokesperson, SMS Hospital.
 
 The SMS Hospital administration has set up an inquiry to look into the incident. A committee comprising three doctors of pathology and microbiology department and one engineer has been formed to investigate into the matter.
 
 The machine which was exploded was purchased from a Delhi-based trader in 2013. Dr Yadav said that the trader has also been informed about the incident.
 
 All Rajasthan Laboratory Employees Association pointed out that the incident has happened due to carelessness of the contractors who had employed lab technicians on contract basis, who do not have thorough knowledge of how to operate these high-tech machines used in testing blood samples.
