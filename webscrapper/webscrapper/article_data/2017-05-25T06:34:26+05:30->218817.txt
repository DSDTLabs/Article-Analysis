MARGAO: The Maina-Curtorim police are yet to make any headway with the investigations into the case of a labourerâ€™s murder that took place at   on Monday night.

 Police sources informed TOI that they were yet to get complete details on the identity of the deceased and that of his assailant. 
 
 The deceased had been identified as   (full name not known), aged between 40-50 years, and hailing from Jharkhand. 
 
 The inquest and panchanama had already been conducted on Tuesday and the postmortem was scheduled to be performed on Wednesday. However, till late in the day, no update was issued on the same.
 
 As foul play was suspected, the police had detained a few migrant labourers, even though none had been arrested in that connection, it was informed. 
 
 Police sources said it appeared the murder was a result of a quarrel between the deceased and another individual, possibly after a drinking binge.
 
 Cuncolim PI  , holding additional charge of the police station, had told TOI that he had registered a complaint of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the unidentified accused, after the body of the migrant labourer was found at   late on Monday night.
