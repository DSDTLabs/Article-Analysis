AHMEDABAD: The output of   has stagnated for the last five years mainly because of the host of rules laid out by   of the  . Industry experts in  ,   (Chemexil) hold pollution control norms responsible for the stagnation.

 The problem of stagnating production and exports in the chemical industry was one of the highlights of the discussion that took place at the conference for announcement of CapIndia 2018 – a three-day exhibition of chemicals, plastics, construction and mining industries.
 
 “Production has been significantly restricted by the pollution control boards (PCB),” said Satish Wagh, chairman, Chemexil. 
 
 “Hence, we are unable to increase production to meet the demand from other industries. Over the past five years, there has been no capacity expansion in any of the companies because we don’t get clearances from the PCBs. This has dented our exports and, of late, is also impacting domestic industries,” said Wagh. Industry experts also say that this is detrimental to the growth of domestic industry because their Chinese counterparts are eating into domestic businesses as well. 
 
 “Importing specialty chemicals such as intermediaries is cheaper,” he said.
 
 “The domestic chemical industry is simply unable to manufacture the required amount due to policy bottlenecks. This is why manufacturers based in China are hurting domestic business as well,” Wagh said.
 
 One of the manufacturers said on the condition of anonymity that the change of guard at the Centre in 2014 had not made any difference in expediting environmental clearances. In fact, the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI) had taken up the matter last year when it had made a representation to the state government for policy changes to facilitate capacity expansion of chemical industries.
