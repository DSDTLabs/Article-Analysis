Rajkot: A woman lodged a complaint of suicide abetment against a couple after she found her husband’s suicide note six months after his death in Rajkot.  In her complaint Bharti Machhoya (43), a resident of Ekta Society on the outskirts of Parapipariya village on Jamnagar Road in Rajkot, accused Wahida Memon and her husband Harun Memon, both residents of Gujarat Housing Board quarters on Dudhsagar Road in Rajkot, of the crime.  Bharti’s husband Anil (45) had hanged himself to death on July 14, 2017. The police had cited financial crisis and mental tension as the reason for the suicide. “However, Bharti stumbled upon Anil’s suicide note in her house on Sunday, in which Anil alleged that Wahida and Harun had siphoned off Rs 1.8 lakh from him,” an official from Gandhigram police station said.  “Anil had given money to the Memon couple when they had promised to get him a house in Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana, a housing scheme funded by the chief minister. The Memons, however, allegedly reneged on their promise and did not get him the house nor did they return the amount,” the official added.
