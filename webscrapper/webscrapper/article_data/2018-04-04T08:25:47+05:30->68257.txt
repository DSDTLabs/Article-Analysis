 The three   have failed to hire any monkey catcher claiming that “not even a single person has showed up for the job, despite the increase in salary”.
 
 The resident welfare associations (RWAs) across the city have been complaining about the rising menace, but in vain. “We have written several letters to the civic bodies, however, the officials claim that they do not have a monkey catcher and have been trying to recruit one. People are afraid to go out, especially senior citizens and children,” said Harjinder Saroha, RWA president, Sector C, Vasant Kunj. 
 
 Askhat Rustagi (25), a resident of Vasant Kunj, who was recently attacked by six monkeys, said the civic bodies have become “blind, deaf, dumb and foolish” in handling the issue. “I was going to a gym when the monkeys attacked me. I injured my hand and was hospitalised for a couple of days,” he said.
 
 The RWA has written several letters to the civic authorities, but nothing has happened yet, moreover, the residents have been living in fear, he added. 
 
 Meanwhile, senior officials from south corporation claimed that they have put up advertisements in UP, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, among other states about the recruitment for the post of monkey catcher. “We have been trying to recruit, but not even a single person has showed up for the job. We have even fixed a monthly salary of Rs 15,000, but haven’t received a single application,” the official added.
