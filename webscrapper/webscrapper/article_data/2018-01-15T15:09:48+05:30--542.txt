 said she at times feels like quitting acting and exploring other arenas of   like direction and production. 
 
  
  
 The 40-year-old   said she is keen to bring other people into the spotlight to enjoy the success she has had in her career. 
 
 "Every day I feel like there is something new I never imagined I'd be doing. If anything, I think in the future I'm going to step back and I'm probably going to produce more. I may even direct." 
 
 "I'm interested in taking the light that has been shined on me and maybe shining it on some other people. I don't feel like I'm having to sacrifice anything because in reality this world is bigger than what my dream was," Chastain said in an interview.
