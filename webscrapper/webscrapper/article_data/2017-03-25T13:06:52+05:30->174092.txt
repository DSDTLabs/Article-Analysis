SURAT: The   MPs representing Surat and Navsari constituencies have written a letter to Union minister of state for civil aviation,   for speeding up the declaration of city airport as customs notified airport, looking at the international traffic potential here.

 The letter, jointly written by MPs Darshana Jardosh and C R Paatil, comes ahead of Sinha’s visit to Surat for launch of   daily flight services by   on March 26. 
 
 Sources said that after attending the launch of Surat-Delhi flight, Sinha will drive straight to the   (SGCCI) at Nanpura to meet president B S Agarwal and the trade fraternity. 
 
 In the letter, the MPs have stated that south Gujarat has the population of around 1.8 million NRIs and the figures collected from travel agents suggested that around four lakh passengers from Surat and south Gujarat travelled to international destinations through Mumbai and Ahmedabad airport during 2015-16. 
 
 However, looking at the huge potential of international traffic, it is desirable for the central government to speed up the sanction of customs notified airport at Surat in order to start limited international operations at the earliest. 
 
 “We have requested the civil aviation ministry to take up the matter with various domestic and international airlines for commencing operations from Surat airport to Dubai, Bangkok, Singapore, New York, Beijing, Los Angeles, etc. Also, we want the runway extension work, cargo terminal project and acquisition of land from state government to further extend the runway up to 4,000 metres,” said Navsari MP C R Paatil.
