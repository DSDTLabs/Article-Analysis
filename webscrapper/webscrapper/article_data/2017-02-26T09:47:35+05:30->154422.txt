BIJNOR: Onset of early summer has triggered early return of   from the region. Birdwatchers have observed that the winged visitors have begun to assemble at Ganga Barrage here in preparation for their flight owing to the sudden rise in temperature. 

 Met officials said northern parts of the country are witnessing onset of an early summer. December and January were found to be the warmest months in the past few years. According to an official, before their long flight back home, these birds first assemble at a common location and take off together– a process which normally begins in March-end. 
 
 Divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “Global warming has had its impact on migratory birds. Birds, especially grey-legged and barheaded geese, have started gathering along the banks of Ganga. Migratory birds from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab gather here at the time of departure. This signals their preparation for the long flight back home to Tibet, China, Russia, Germany and other European countries. However, this year their return is early by at least a month.”
