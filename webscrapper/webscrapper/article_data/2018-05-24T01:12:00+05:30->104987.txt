New Delhi: The proposal for Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Centre for National Security Studies has attracted criticism from the minorities sections as both, Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) and Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, have written to the university against it.

 DMC, in its notice has asked for an explanation on why the course on ‘Islamic terrorism’ is so named despite   from members of the university’s academic council (AC).
 
 Zafarul-Islam Khan, chairman DMC, said the commission has asked   administration to reply to several of its queries by June 5. “We have asked if there is any concept paper or proposal to include a course on ‘Islamic Terror’, and if so, they should provide us that,” he said.
 
 The letter by the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind general secretary, Maulana Mahmood Madani claimed the new course “has hurt the sentiments of not only the Muslims, but all those who believe in respecting all religions .”
 
 Both the groups, however, clarified that they are not against the  , but have reservations on one of its course only. tnn
