SURAT: The Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (Fostta) has urged the  , an association of wholesale cloth traders to build pressure on the Centre and the Delhi government to stop the sealing drive as crores of rupees of the textile traders in Surat dealing with their counterparts in Delhi have been stuck for the past many months. 

 The drive began in December 2017 after the   ordered the sealing of commercial establishments on the grounds of encroachment, illegal construction and non-payment of conversion charges for violating the Master Plan of Delhi. 
 
 An increasing amount of pressure on political parties is building up to find a solution to the ongoing sealing drive in Delhi, which has led to thousands of shops getting shut and people losing jobs.
 
 Champalal Bothra, secretary of Fostta, said, “Delhi market is one of the biggest consumers of saris, lehngas, kurtis, dress materials and home furnishing fabrics manufactured in Surat. After the sealing drive began in January 2018, outstanding payments of Surat traders have got stuck and demand from Delhi traders has dived considerably.”
 
 Bothra added, “We have written a letter to the   to find a solution and help Fostta recover outstanding payments from traders. We are preparing a list of traders who are yet to get their outstanding dues from their counterparts in Delhi.”
 
 Devkishan Manghani, former president of Fostta, said, “Most markets in Delhi have shut shops due to the sealing drive. This has hit the Surat market since past three months. Traders are unable to deliver fabrics to Delhi as the shops are shut. Delhi is a big market and the sealing drive has cast a dark shadow on traders from Surat.”
