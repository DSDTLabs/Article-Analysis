WASHINGTON: Islamic   terror group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was injured in an air strike in May 2017 and had to relinquish control of the group for up to five months, US officials told  . US intelligence agencies have assessed with a high degree of confidence that the world’s most wanted man was near Raqqa, Syria, when the missile struck, the officials said on Sunday.

 Their assessment is based on reports from IS detainees and refugees in northern Syria that emerged months after the air strike. Baghdadi’s injuries were not considered life-threatening but they did mean he could not continue to command the daily operations of the group, said the officials.
 
 However, it remains unclear whether   was hit in a targeted attack or if he was part of “collateral damage”.
