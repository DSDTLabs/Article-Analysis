CHENNAI: Physicist   will deliver a   on his recent book "Naturally - Tread Softly on the Planet" at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation here at 11:30 am on Tuesday. 

 Known for his significant work on preserving natural resources, especially water, Soni has made seminal contributions to understanding of phenomena ranging from topological structures in physics to the nucleon and neutron stars and from the matter-antimatter puzzle to evolutionary networks. 
 
 He has produced a significant body of work that deals with non-invasive, ‘Preserve and Use’, solutions to contemporary problems, particularly relating to water. 
 
 Soni has received many awards and been a distinguished speaker at many institutes and universities worldwide. The   in Delhi exists thanks to these efforts. 
 
 He and his coworkers proposed a novel natural water storage and recharge scheme which has helped in the protection and moratorium on building on the floodplain of the river Yamuna. This non-invasive and perennial scheme is already providing water to a million people in Delhi at no cost.
