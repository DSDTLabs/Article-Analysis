NAGPUR: Cases of tree felling discreetly in the wee hours are becoming common in the city. The officials of   (AI) have lodged a complaint at Sitabuldi police station against illegal tree felling in front of their office in Civil Lines.

 A 40-year-old Neem tree was reportedly cut six days ago around 3am. As per the officials, the security guard posted at the AI office tried to stop the miscreants but was threatened. “He alerted the police control room and the cops reached the spot within 15 minutes. But by then, the miscreants had left,” officials said.
 
 The officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s garden department also conducted a spot panchnama. “Since the fellers are unidentified, the cops are looking into the matter. We are waiting for their report,” said garden superintendent   Mate.
 
 A team of Green Vigil foundation too had carried a spot inspection. “The tree was not chopped off for timber as it was left at the spot. It seems it was cut because it was causing some obstruction,” said founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee.
