CHENNAI: Public perception has it that Tamil Nadu and Kerala are safer for women than states in the central or northern parts of the country. But data from Indian Railways shows that maximum cases of   and assault against women passengers were registered on trains running within Southern  , the zone which has administrative control over the network spread across the two states.

 Twenty percent of all cases across Indian Railways was registered in Southern Railway. Of the 982 cases between 2014 and 2016, 206 cases were booked in Southern Railway. This is almost double of the number of cases in  , which registered 128 cases in the three-year period.
 
 While the exact number pertaining to the states is not available, it could be in the ratio of 60:40, a senior railway official said.
 
 Officers of the   (RPF), the security department which has stepped up vigil on trains, said this was a direct impact of two factors: Since both states have better awareness, more women come forward to register complaints, also, molestation cases are extremely high on trains in Kerala. “The common complaint is groping on a crowded train,” an RPF officer said.
 
 Higher literacy and political movements for gender equality in these states mean that many women travel in general compartment coaches, where such complaints come from, the officer said.
 
 Railway has allotted six berths in sleeper class for women on every train and four lower berths per coach in all classes of all trains for senior citizens, women of 45 and above, and pregnant women who are travelling alone.
 
 Second class accommodation for women in unreserved coaches is also provided on almost all long-distance trains. A similar facility is available on suburban trains as well. Ladies special trains are also operated on suburban routes. RPF women personnel escort such trains. Any passenger can contact the security helpline 182 to report such cases, the official said.
