Chennai: Although a division bench of the   has stayed an order by a single judge which allowed the resumption of public demonstrations at the Marina, a section of residents expressed the hope that the government ban on   at the venue will eventually be overturned.

 Activists and students say that curbing protests on the Marina is a violation of democratic rights guaranteed by the Constitution but police beg to differ, citing potential law and order issues. 
 
 Retired judge of the Madras high court Justice D Hariparanthaman said permission should be granted for protests not only on the Marina but also at any other venue desired by those seeking to express dissent in order to give life to Article 19 (1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution. "No such bans on peaceful form of protest including hunger strike existed even during the British era," he added.
 
 "What is the point in conducting demonstrations at Valluvar Kottam and Chepauk Guest House (places earmarked by the city police for protests) where fewer people can gather?" said Arun Nedunchezhiyan from Poovulagin Nanbargal, an environmental organisation. 
 
 On the other hand,   state president Tamilisai Soundararajan said, "Marina should be a place for the public and not protests. Protesters should be keen on the cause and not the venue. Overtly emphasising on the latter indicates that they are more concerned about getting publicity." 
 
 A senior police official said that allowing protests across such a vast expanse is dangerous. "During the   protests, some tried to jump into the sea and the police had a tough time in rescuing them and bringing law and order under control." 
 
 In response, students from the  , who participated in huge numbers at the protests last year, suggested that a small portion of the Marina can be earmarked for this purpose but a blanket ban is just an indication of the governmentâ€™s weakness.
