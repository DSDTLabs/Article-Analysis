 The company had bought 110 acres of land from the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) for Rs 145 crore to set up a manufacturing unit, and its representatives completed the registry process with the stamps and registry department of Gautam Budh Nagar on Friday. 
 
 In an attempt to promote industry in the city, the state government has also conditionally waived off stamp duty amounting to Rs 9.70 crore for OPPO.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Tej Singh Yadav, sub-registrar (stamps and registrations, G B Nagar) confirmed that OPPO has completed the registration process for the land.

 “But this waiver is on the condition that the company starts production before December 2017. If it fails to fulfil this condition, the amount of Rs 9.70 crore, which has been deposited as bank guarantee, will be forfeited,” he said. Yadav added that the company has also deposited a lease rent of Rs 53 crore for the land.

They will be putting up their unit across 110 acres in Greater Noida’s Ecotech 7, and are likely to start producing mobile handsets before the end of the year. The company unit will be fully functional by March 2020,” he said.
