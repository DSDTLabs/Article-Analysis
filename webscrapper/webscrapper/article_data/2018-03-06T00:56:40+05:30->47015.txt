MUMBAI: The BEST is cutting electricity tariff by 3-10% for residential consumers within the island city in 2018-19. It has sought a further 2-3% dip in cost in its mid-term review petition pending before regulator MERC, officials said. 

 
  
 
 "According to the multi-year tariff order of the MERC, we have got permission for a drop in tariff (see box for rates)," said a senior BEST official, who did not wish to be named.
 
 So, if you were in the 101-300 units category, and your monthly bill was around Rs 1,000, the bill could come down by a maximum of Rs 80, the official said.
 
 "Consumers can expect further savings due to a drop in monthly electricity bills for next financial year," he said, mentioning the 2-3% cut sought in the mid-term review petition.
 
 BEST already has the cheapest   for high-end residential users as compared to its rivals across the state. For commercial users/offices/business houses in the island city, the tariff has already dropped by more than 17% in the past two years, and this helped BEST retain its customers. In the industry category, the tariff dropped by 19% a couple of years ago. There could be a further reduction in these categories as well although the details are not known, sources said.
 
 The BEST also plans to call in arrears from customers. A recent report had showed that Rs 79 crore had been recovered till date, but Rs 24.4 crore was yet to be recouped from government departments, and Rs 24.8 from non-government agencies. BEST committee member   agreed that pending dues were mounting.
 
 Consumer activist   has petitioned the MERC alleging that BEST was "illegally" collecting double fixed charges from a section of electricity consumers in the island city. 
 
 BEST officials denied the charge, saying the power bills were being generated properly. Shenoy has demanded action against BEST officials.
