PUNE: The   on Tuesday arrested 25-year-old Hanumant Avare, an employee of a   on Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, for allegedly helping two robbers obtain money by swiping the   of the victim at the refuelling station’s PoS terminal.

 Investigations revealed Avare was earning a handsome commission from robbers — Hasan Shaikh (25) and Vishal Sakhare (24). The duo would forcibly bring their prey to the petrol pump to swipe the debit card and get the cash from Avare.
 
 
 
 
 Shaikh and Sakhare had also robbed 34-year-old teacher Prashant Kasbe from Undri on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass on January 6. The duo had taken Rs2,000 and his debit card. Kasbe, who was frightened, did not approach police. He, however, had blocked his debit card so the suspects were not able to use Kasbe’s card. “We traced Kasbe using his debit card found with the suspects,” police said.
