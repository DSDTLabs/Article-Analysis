HYDERABAD: A  's decision to allow a   to exit the vehicle to buy a pencil while on her way to school ended in her death after she ran across the road to board the bus again and was hit by a passing car on Monday morning.

 Seven-year-old  , who was accompanied by two more girls when she had left the bus, was hit by a Swift Dzire at   at Shabad. A student of Sir Chaitanya Concept School, Divya was a resident of Mallareddy Village and had boarded the bus near her residence to reach the school at Nagagudda. Divya's father   is a farmer.
 
 Around 7.30 am, when the bus was en route Puthugal village, Divya requested the driver to stop so that she could purchase a pencil from a stationery shop. The driver allowed her to disembark and sent two more girls to accompany her to the shop. The bus attender was on leave.
 
 “The driver told the three children that he would return after picking up a few other students who lived in nearby Sitarampur. But when the bus driver returned, instead of picking up the three children from the spot he had left them, he stopped the bus on the other side of the road. The three small children were then forced to cross the road to board the bus,“ Chevella inspector G Guravaiah said.
 
 All the three children managed to reach the median.But as they were about to go to the other side, suddenly Divya ran towards the waiting bus unaware of a car moving towards her. The car hit her and she suffered a head injury. She succumbed while being shifted to hospital.
 
 The car driver fled from the location and surrendered before Chevella police. Police, however, were tight-lipped about the whole incident.Neither the parents or anyone else appears to have bothered to question the bus driver's carelessness in letting the children leave the bus unattended. But the villagers later gathered at Shabad police station and staged a protest demanding that the car driver be arrested immediately. A case was registered against him.
