CHENNAI: Southern Railways has announced that   between Chennai and   will run   from April 1 after the last 25km of   of Kalpattichatram – Tamaraipadi railway stations in the Villupuram-Dindigul section was completed and opened for traffic.

 “The electrified double line between Chennai and Madurai would ease congestion in the chord line section and pave the way for operation of more services. There would be substantial reduction in   also,” said a statement issued by P A Dhananjeyan, chief public relations officer of SR.
 
  
  
 
 The project was completed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore, covering 270.15km.
 
 However, senior railway officials have differed on whether trains on the route will actually be speeded up. “Before this 25km doubling was finished, majority of the crossings were eliminated and trains have already been speeded up in November 2017 time-table. I doubt if any more trains will be speeded up,” said a senior railway official.
 
 When asked, Dhananjeyan did not specify the trains that would benefit or the date from which the running time would change. “Taking advantage of the double line, the announcement will be shared as and when it is planned,” he said.
 
 The railway release stated that there are a total of 43 stations in Villupuram – Dindigul project, including four junction stations. 
 
 Another project that was commissioned recently was the 73km   between Pattukottai and Karaikudi.
 
 “The line traverses through the districts of Thanjavur, Pudukkottai & Sivaganga. Paddy is grown in abundance here. Commissioning the newly converted broad gauge section will increase the movement of food grains from delta regions to other parts of the state and will provide a shorter route for movement of fertilisers from Milavittan,” the zone said in a statement.
