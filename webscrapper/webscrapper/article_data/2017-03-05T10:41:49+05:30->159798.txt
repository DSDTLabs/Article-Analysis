AGARTALA: A team of six Trinamool Congress MLAs from the state will meet Prime Minister   to urge the initiation of a   probe into the   scam and the cheating of other non-banking financial companies in the state. 

 The Prime Minister's office reached out to   MLA Asish Kumar Saha in response to a letter seeking a meeting with the Prime Minister. 
 
 "The party wants an impartial probe into the scam by CBI and proper compensation for 14 lakh duped depositors who were cheated by Rose Valley and other   in connivance with the ruling Left Front government. Unless CBI comes it would not help much," Saha said.
