SALEM: Two days ahead of a visit by   working president Stalin to oversee desilting work undertaken by his partymen in the Kacharayan Kuttai lake at   in  , a group of   (Amma) cadres and villagers entered the lake with earthmovers and tractors to take out the silt.

 This led to a clash between DMK and AIADMK (Amma) cadres, forcing the district authorities to intervene and stop the desilting work for the day.
 
 The DMK cadres claimed that it was with ulterior motives that the AIADMK workers obtained permission from revenue and PWD officials to take out silt from the lake where they have been carrying out desilting activities for the past one month.
 
 Tension prevailed in the area when a group of villagers and AIADMK cadres entered the lake with earthmovers and tractors and damaged the side walls which were recently constructed by DMK cadres.
 
 When they came to know about this, DMK cadres rushed to the lake bed and clashed with the AIADMK workers.   district SP P Rajan along with Sankari DSP Ashok Kumar and other police officials came to the spot and initiated peace talks with both groups.
 
 Revenue divisional officer (RDO) of Sankari division Rama Duraimurugan pacified the crowd and took cadres of both parties to his office to hold talks with them. In the meeting chaired by the RDO and district SP, DMK functionaries argued with officials to stop desilting work in the lake by AIADMK cadres at the earliest.
 
 Finally, the RDO ordered the party cadre and villagers to move out from the lake with earthmovers and tractors. “We have stopped desilting work for one day,” the RDO said.
 
 DMK functionary S R Sivalingam said, “Stalin will come and inspect our work on July 27 as scheduled.”
 
 More than 300 police personnel were deployed at Konganapuram and Edappadi to keep the situation under control. They refused to allow DMK cadres near the lake site.
