MADURAI: Even as the smart city tag beckons  , the civic body still practises an outdated method to desilt the city's sewerage network which causes much inconvenience to residents and road users. On Tuesday, the civic body employed labourers to remove silt from an open drainage channel in Villapuram area on  , also known as APK main road, one of the key stretches in Madurai leading to the airport.

 The workers removed the silt and spread the sludge by the roadside. According to corporation officials, this is done to allow the silt to dry. “If we cart off the silt mixed with grey water, by the time it reaches Vellakkal (city's landfill site), the liquid would have seeped and left an ugly trail on the road,” said a corporation official. The official added that the civic body had a few other options to unclog drains. “Most of the localities in extended limits of the city like Villapuram still do not have an underground sewerage network,” the official said.
 
 Sujatha, a passerby, told TOI that the sludge raised a stink. “It is impossible to walk on the road putting up with the smell (from the sludge),” she said. Retired PWD chief engineer,  , believes the problem is due to poor design of the drains. “The drainage pipes installed by the corporation, including the open drains of erstwhile panchayats and municipalities, do not have proper gradient. Gray water should be flowing through the drains at a self-cleaning velocity. It takes away silt as it moves along the drain,” he said.
