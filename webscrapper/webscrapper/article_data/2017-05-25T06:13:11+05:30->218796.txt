PANAJI: People commuting on the   ferry route are likely to have an upgrade in service. The government is in the process of introducing Ro-Ro (roll-on, roll-off)  , replacing the existing ferries plying on this route.

 A Ro-Ro is a bigger size ferry with two ramps, two engines and can go to-and-fro from one jetty to another without the need to turn around.
 
 On an average, there are about 11,000 commuters and over 5,000 two-wheelers travelling on the Panaji-Betim ferry route every day. Considering the number of people travelling each day, the ferry service is expected to reduce pressure on existing road networks.
 
 A proposal for Ro-Ro service has been prepared by the Captain of Ports (CoP), river navigation department ( ) and the public works deparmtnet (PWD). The proposal has been sent for approval to chief minister  . Following his approval, an expression of interest will be published in local newpapers for those interested in building vessels for the service.
 
 The service will be operated by the RND. The staff aboard the Ro-Ro service will comprise a coxswain, a machinist and two sailors. At the time of the construction of the Ro-Ro ferries, the nature and quantity of life-saving apparatus will be decided on by the authorities at the CoP.
 
 One Ro-Ro is equivalent to two regular ferry boats and can accommodate twice as many people. It can accommodate approximately 200 people, 12 cars and 100 two-wheelers at a time.
 
 Sources said the service would be faster and more efficient with Ro-Ro than the existing ferry boats which currently move at 4-7 knots.
