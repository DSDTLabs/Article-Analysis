AHMEDABAD: A Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) faction, led by its cadre in-charge Dilip  , announced on Sunday that it will hold a march from Umiyadham in Unjha to   in Kagvad in   — the two main places of worship of Patidars in Gujarat. Sabva, who had recently parted ways with   leader   but continued with the organization, said that the march will begin on June 24 and it will cover 97 talukas of the state.

 “We will carry portraits of 14 Patidar martyrs, who were killed during the quota agitation, along with the pictures of Goddess Uma and Khodal and also of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel,” said Sabva while addressing reporters here. He said that posters of PAAS leaders will not be carried during the march.
 
 Sabva said, “The yatra will focus on justice for the Patidars martyred during the quota agitation, withdrawal of cases against Patidars and also on our main issue, reservation under OBC quota. The yatra will cover villages and towns in 97 talukas, covering 3,349 kms in north Gujarat, central Gujarat, Surat and Saurashtra.”
 
 “This yatra may find a place in the Guinness Book of World Record or Limca Book of Records,” added Sabva, who had agitated against Hardik Patel after the defeat of   in December 2017 Gujarat polls.
 
 When asked if Hardik will join the yatra, Sabva said, “I don’t have any personal enmity with Hardik and I am organizing this yatra for the community. If he is dedicated to te cause, he will join. Sabva said that neither him nor any other member from his faction will contest polls until the Patidar community gets reservation.
