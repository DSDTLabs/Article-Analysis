VIJAYAWADA: The much-hyped second conclave of finance ministers scheduled for Monday in   has lost its sheen with the Centre allegedly putting a spanner in the wheels. Only six states, including host Andhra Pradesh, are participating in the event.   has not confirmed its participation. Punjab, Puducherry, Delhi, Kerala, and West Bengal — all non-BJP states — are attending.

 “We invited Telangana, but there is no confirmation yet. Many states are under pressure from the Union government not to attend the conclave,” Ch Kutumba Rao, vice-chairman, AP Planning Board, told TOI. Telangana also did not attend the first finance ministers’ conclave held in Thiruvananthapuram, which discussed the Terms of Reference (ToR) suggested by the 15th Finance Commission and financial loss to state governments in tax devolution and fund allocation by the Centre.
 
 During an interaction with TOIearlier, Kerala finance minister Dr TM Thomas Issac said Telangana objected to the conclave agenda — injustice being meted out to southern states due to ToR of 15th finance commission — and wanted the focus to be on cooperative federalism and the loss that can accrue to all the states.
 
 The focus of the Amaravati conclave is fiscal federalism. But despite the agenda being broad, no representative from Telangana is attending. Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy, deputy CM of Delhi Manish Sisodia, Kerala finance minister Dr Thomas Issac, West Bengal finance minister Amit Misra and his Punjab counterpart Manpreet Singh will attend the meeting.
 
 The conference to be held in Block 1 of the secretariat at Velagapudi will have representatives talking about concerns of states in the morning session. In the afternoon, a draft memorandum prepared during the first conclave will be discussed before being sent to President   as a representation.
