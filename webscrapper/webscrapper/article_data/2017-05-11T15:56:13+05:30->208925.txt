Actress Zoe Saldana says she was worried that doing too many sci-fi films would harm her career. The actress says she also feared she would miss out on something special if she turned down 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. 

    

     




 "I don't know how to say no to these filmmakers. First I booked 'Avatar', and as I was shooting that, J J Abrams was getting ready to do 'Star Trek'. And those collaborations got the attention of ('Guardians' director) James Gunn." "I really didn't want to say yes because this was the third sci-fi film I'd be doing, and I was afraid it might not be great for my career. But I got the sense that I would be missing out on something so incredibly special that I said yes," Saldana said.
