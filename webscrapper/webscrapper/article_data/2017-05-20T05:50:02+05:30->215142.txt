LUCKNOW: Only 108   were given admission to class I in the state’s   under the   ( ) Act. And these 108 admissions in the 2014-15 session were against 6.16 lakh seats reserved for them, as per   report on primary education for the year ending March 31, 2016, just because the then state government didn’t do much to inform the beneficiaries about inclusive education.

 The CAG report also revealed that for the academic session 2015-16, 3,278 differently-abled and/or economically and socially weaker children were given admissions in class I in UP schools as against the total capacity of 6.46 lakh. The RTE Act, 2009 calls for a 25% reservation in private schools for children from disadvantaged groups in the neighbourhood and free and compulsory elementary education till its completion.
 
 The report pointed out that then government delayed the notification process of identifying the children belonging to disadvantaged groups. It was the SP government which, in December 2012, adopted the RTE rules. The same was to be implemented from 2013-14. However, the government neither made an effort to publicize the information among the beneficiaries, nor any such child was identified, stated the CAG report. 
 
 Subsequently, in two years, 2014-15 and 2-15-16, only 3,386 kids out of 12.62 lakh seats got inclusive education. The CAG report stated that state project director (SPD) is to be held responsible for the poor show. The basic education director seeks reimbursement for children enrolled under the above clause of RTE Act from the state implementation authority through the approval board.
 
 CAG pointed out that lack of coordination between the implementation agency and state project director led to insufficient enrolment of kids belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged groups. “I have not seen the report till now. I am only one-and-half-month old as the project head. I can’t comment before looking at the old files,” said Vedpati Mishra, SPD for UP Education for All Project Board.
 
 The report also reveals that out of 18.76 lakh differently-abled students enrolled in primary schools between 2010-16, only 2.09 lakh had disability certificate. Despite the non-availabilty of any disability proof, the state government found the remaining 16.67 lakh students eligible for admissions under section 3 of the Right for Free and Compulsory Act (RTE). The government also allocated Rs 287.88 crore for 18.76 lakh students. A total of 21.70 lakh specially-abled students were identified for admissions under the disabled category.
