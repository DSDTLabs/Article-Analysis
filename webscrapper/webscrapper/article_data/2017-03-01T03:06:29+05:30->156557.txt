Ahmedabad: “Who killed  ?” was the question posed by the opposition during the debate on the motion of thanks for the governor’s speech on the first day of the state assembly session. The opposition cited a high court judgment to ask the government who killed the former minister of state for home.

    high court in August 2011 acquitted all 12 accused, including prime accused Ashgar Ali in the Haren Pandya murder case. Pandya was found shot dead in his car on the morning of March 26, 2003, when the former minister was out for his morning walk in the Law Garden area in the heart of the city.
 
 Congress MLA Punja Vansh in the assembly said: “The high court has acquitted all the accused, which indicates that those arrested were not involved in the murder. The government has not carried out a proper investigation and hence after all the accused were released by the high court, there is still a mystery over the death of Pandya.”
 
 The ruling MLAs jumped to their feet with deputy CM   requesting the speaker to expunge the remarks. Minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja quickly said that the case was investigated by the   and the UPA government was in power at the Centre when the investigation completed and the case was tried.
 
 Senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil said that the   government talks of terrorism, but they forget that it was Congress leaders who sacrificed their lives fighting terrorism. On the other hand, BJP leaders were involved in getting people killed whether it was Akshardham or Haren Pandya.
