VISAKHAPATNAM: For  , the son of a small farmer in Ranasthalam village of Srikakulam district, Monday was a day of dreams. With 156 marks, he stood second in the TS   engineering exam and now wants to study compute sciences. 

 Educated in Kewsava Reddy High School in Srikakulam and Sri Chaitanya Visakhapatnam, Ram Prasad had earlier secured rank 182 in the AP Eamcet.
 
 While on his way home to Ranasthalam from Visakhapatnam, the young lad, barely 17 years old, spoke about his future plans. “My aim is to get into IIT Bombay and study computer sciences. I’m confident that I have done well in the IIT-JEE (Advanced) exam conducted yesterday,” he said. 
 
 An elated Appala Naidu, father of the youngster, said that his son will achieve what he has set out to. “I’m sure he will get his dream seat in Bombay. He has always been a diligent and hard-working boy totally focussed on academics,”   said. “Neither my wife   nor I can read or write. My son comes from a totally illiterate background, but has always been a topper. He scored 10 out of 10 in his SSC Board exam in 2015. Today, he has done us all very proud.”
 
 Students from north coastal AP have done well in the TS Eamcet (Agriculture and allied streams) as well.
