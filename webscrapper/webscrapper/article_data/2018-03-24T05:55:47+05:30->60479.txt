 BAD: Justice   has ruled that courts have no business in decision making on whether prisoners should be released prematurely, he observed that such benefits cannot be loosely given to all types of prisoners, particularly rapists.

 The   said that the government can make classification of prisoners on basis of gravity and types of offence and can deny remission to offenders against women. “An offence punishable under Section 376 of the IPC (rape) is not only an offence against a singular individual, but against the collective as it offends the dignity of a woman and creates a terrortrodden atmosphere in the society, because a rapist is a menace in the civilized society. 
 
 Sometimes, liberal delineation with a convict of this nature decreases the faith in the system and a feeling of insensitivity prevails. Offences of dowry death and cruel treatment for demand of dowry have their own social impact, as the said offences corrode the essential social fabric and slowly denude it of stability affecting the age of old established institutions,” the order reads.
