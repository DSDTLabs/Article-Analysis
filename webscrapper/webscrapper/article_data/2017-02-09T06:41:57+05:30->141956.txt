SURAT: Surat Municipal Corporation ( SMC) has decided to build city Mayor’s bungalow on   near   circle in   area. The bungalow will come up on 4,000 sq metres of land. As many as eight architects have shown interest designing the house. However, SMC has narrowed it down to architect   and made a proposal to standing committee for clearance in this week’s meeting to be held on Thursday. 

 Mayor’s quarter will have 7,000 sq feet of built-up area on the ground floor which would house Mayor’s personal office, conference hall, two guest rooms apart from servant and security quarters. On the first floor, there would be 2,700 sq feet of built-up area which would house three bedrooms for Mayor’s family. 
 
 “Once the standing committee approves it the work for the bungalow will be completed in 18 months. The decision on the Mayor’s house has been for over a decade,” said an official from   zone. 
 
 Initially, mayor’s bungalow was planned to be built on the land opposite Gateway hotel. The location then changed twice. However, work never began on the project.
