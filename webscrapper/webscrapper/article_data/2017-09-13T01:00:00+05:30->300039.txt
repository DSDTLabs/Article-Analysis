The students of Rajalakshmi Engineering College were keen on showcasing their talents in the best possible manner at OPPO Chennai Times Fresh Face 2017 audition. We saw a good number of them rehearsing their acts before the audition. Sai Rajkumar, who played the hero in the National Award-winning film Kuttram Kadithal, was the judge for the day. Like participants from other colleges, most of the students here, too, chose songs from popular Tamil films to showcase their singing prowess.   Those students who were keen on displaying their flexible moves chose peppy numbers from recent popular films in Tamil and Hindi, much to the delight of the crowd. Akash Shritharan, who managed to impress the audience with his skill on guitar, emerged the winner among boys. P Sai Charan Varma, the first runner-up, mesmerised the viewers, thanks to the grace in his moves which made the audience go crazy. Karthik Shankar settled for second runner-up position with the melody number he crooned.    Nivedha Suresh was adjudged the winner among girls for her classical dance performance. The first runner-up, Sahana S, with her soothing voice, won many hearts. Sai Pooja R won the second runner-up place for the confidence she had while singing her favourite number.
