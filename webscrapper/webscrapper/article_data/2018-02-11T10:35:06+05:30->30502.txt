Chandigarh: A status on social media that reads “Scored …% in boards” would sound much better that reads “Having a pizza with friends”. This is how schools are trying to motivate students from keeping away from social media during exams. With mobile   reaching a level of addiction, it poses as one of the major distractions to students during exams and their preparations. And the students agree to this. From counsellors to parents, everyone ask them to stay away from such distractions. But, the question that the students are asking now is how to kill that craving?

 According to some educationists, saying no to mobile phone usage is the biggest mistake. Finding a substitute is important. “Telling the students not to use phones or social media would rather make their brains focus more on these. The best way is to help them out is to replace these addictive cravings with better time management. I personally feel that children, who are conditioned to enjoy the inner satisfaction of being occupied with study and productive leisure activities, automatically withdraw from such time and energy-wasting cravings,” said Vibha Ray, principal of DAV Lahore in Sector 8, Chandigarh.
 
 While some students say that we use it only for checking out the educational apps and discussions regarding exam preparations with friends, teachers feel this too is leading to wastage of their time.
 
 “Unknowingly, they are wasting most of their time in chatting with friends. They talk about exams doubts even if they do not have a genuine doubt. These are not constructive discussions. These are distractions that give them a feeling of ‘preparation mode’,” said Prabhjot Kaur, a government school counsellor. To stay away, she said, “Switch off your wifi or internet, customise notifications on smartphones and fix times to use the mobile phone. Tell your friends not to message during your study time. The best thing would be to delete the social apps.”
 
 Reiterating the same, principal of AKSIPS school in Sector 41 Ritu Bali said, “I told my students to delete apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. I encouraged them to instead go out and play, sit with parents or watch television. According to me, the best stress-busters are parents. No doubt internet has a lot to offer academically. Even, I share some helpful blogs with children. But, the question arises that how many of the students are using the technology for that purpose?”
 
 Schools suggest that parents need to watch the use of mobile phones by children at home. “Allow children to use only the landlines. Parents too need to restrain themselves from using smartphones in front of the children,” Bali adds.
 
 The counsellors are also giving lectures in schools to Class X and XII students these days on the same topic. According to them, the best way to stay away from the disturbances is quite simple - switching off the phone while studying. However, the students say, this do not really help and the craving multiplies manifold.
 
 Some of the experts from the city feel that the problem that started years ago will not end in few months. “The onus of controlling the usage of mobile phone lies both on the parents and the students. Parents should get the internet packs removed , delete all the games and social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp among others from their kids’ phones. The students should write in bold letters on a paper that “I have controlled my mobile usage” and stick it at a prominent place in his studyroom. This will motivate and encourage them to control their mobile usage. The mobile phone should be put on airplane mode and stowed away inside a locked cupboard to discourage easy access at the time of study. Put up your boards datesheet at the most easily visible place in your room to remind you of the upcoming exams and the pending work to be done,” said another counsellor.
 
 Some concerned students who have identified it as a distraction but are still finding it difficult to stay away from it, are also approaching the counselors and teachers to know how to keep away from them. “It is an addiction for sure. I keep checking the phone even when it is not ringing. I cannot switch it off because there are apps, which I use for doubt clarification. Then, we have a WhatsApp group for doubt clearance and a group of friends, where we discuss about preparations,” said a Class X student, who was not willing to be named.
 
 ‘Right mix of study and play’
 
 In the contemporary education system, where learning and gadgets are inextricably interwoven, it is tricky for the parents to curtail the habitual squandering of time on fancy gadgets by their children. It is significant to come up with a regime to centre the learner’s attention towards managing time effectively. Schools and parents can team up together to negotiate with their children to infuse the home-learning programme by proper study hours and playtime alongwith limited but productive use of gadgets.
