MUMBAI: The   demolished 43   at the landmark   in Mahalaxmi on Thursday and Friday. The demolition drive was met with strong resistance from locals and the BMC had to file a   against them for obstructing work. Six persons were arrested in the case.

 Dhobi Ghat—the world’s biggest open air laundry-—was built during the British Raj in 1890 and has 500 licenced wash pens with flogging stones. The BMC said that many washermen had illegally constructed three-storey structures and they were recently issued notices.
 
 Assistant commissioner (G-South ward) D K Jain said, “We initiated the drive to demolish all   in the area on Thursday and our drive will continue. Locals tried to stop the drive by manhandling our staff. We are taking police help to avoid any untoward incidents.”
 
 The BMC admitted that some of the demolished structures were old but said that no construction was allowed near the flogging stones meant for washing clothes.
 
 Local corporator Kishori Pednekar said, “Initially, the BMC demolished one newly built structure and locals challenged it. After this, the BMC decided to act against all illegal constructions in the area. On humanitarian grounds, we suggested that those who are losing their houses be given permissions to build temporary structures, and not concrete ones which are illegal.”
 
 The annual turnover at Dhobi Ghat is estimated at around Rs 100 crore. Each day, over 7,000 people flog, scrub, dye and bleach clothes on concrete wash pens, dry them on ropes, press them and transport them to different parts of the city. Over one lakh clothes are washed each day. Some of the wealthier dhobis have given up on manual cleaning and have installed large mechanical washing and drying machines.
