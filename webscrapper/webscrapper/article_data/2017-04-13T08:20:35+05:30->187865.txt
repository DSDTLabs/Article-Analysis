INDORE: Rejecting an appeal by the state government seeking possession of Ujjain’s  , the Indore bench of   high court cleared the path for the sale of the mill land by the official liquidator for the payment of dues of the workers amounting to Rs 67crore. The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court on Wednesday dismissed the company appeal, which was filed by the state government 13 years ago, challenging a previous order passed by the court in 2004. 

 The court in its order dated 2004 had held that the Vinod Mills land was given by the state to the company as a grant, and hence its possession cannot be given back to the state in condition of its winding up.
 
 The division bench of Justice SC Sharma and Justice RK Dubey heard the company appeal on Wednesday and upheld the previous order which stated that the official liquidator of the mill had the right to sell the property of the mill and distribute the proceeds to the workers against their dues. 
 
 The Ujjain’s Vinod Mills had closed down in 1991, and the custody of the 45 acres of land was given to the official liquidator MK Sahu through the order passed in 1998 in the company petition.
 
  “As many as 4400 workers were left jobless with their dues reaching up to Rs 67 crore after the mills closed down. Many workers of the mill have also died since its closure. The government had sought legal right over its land, which was opposed by the mill workers and the official liquidator appointed in 1998,”said advocate HY Mehta.
