To the joy of many,   has been chosen to be the face on the £10 note being released this July by the  . The popular   is the only non-royal woman on the UK currency after   (a philanthropist) was removed from the new £5 note.

 But, on the unveiling of the design of the note, many were upset by the alterations to her face. The image is said to make her look prettier and most think she wouldn't have approved of her face being doctored so.
 
 Austen biographer   said to The Mirror, “They presumably said to the artist: make it look prettier." She added, “It is like doctoring a selfie by a celebrity. It is such a shame because that demure image is just not Austen. We don't think Jane would have approved.”
 
 The most iconic image we have of her is the one her sister made of her, which has been described as, 'sour' and the new note does seem to stray far from it. As someone who critiqued society's small-minded view of beauty and it's obsession with standards in her writing, it seems almost spiteful to apply the same sin to her memory.
