GHAZIABAD: The   has expedited work on the second   proposed between   and Bhatia More. The move follows a feasibility report submitted by the   on the 2.3km elevated road along with the design.

 
  
  
 
 A   official said the project had been given precedence over the   even though it was conceived much before.
 
 “We have been working on the second elevated road project for some time. Recently, we had asked the CPWD to prepare a feasibility report for the stretch between Ghanta Ghar and Bhatia More. It was submitted recently” said SS Verma, the superintendent engineer of GDA. “After going through the feasibility report and design, it has been decided that the elevated road will be taken up first because of the immediate need to decongest the stretch, which is in perpetual traffic jam, and partly because of a funds issue” added Verma.
 
 The project has been estimated at Rs 250 crore. Officials said that given the fact that there are two important projects like the Rajnagar Extension flyover and the Vasundhara flyover where work has already started by the UP State Bridge Corporation, the development agency has decided to hold back the Hapur Chungi flyover project for some time.
 
 “We had invited tenders for the Hapur Chungi flyover twice. For the time being, it has been put in the backburner,” said Verma.
 
 Verma, speaking on the design for the Ghanta Ghar-Bhatia More stretch that the CPWD has proposed, said: “The CPWD has proposed three designs for the 2.3km-long elevated road. As of now, we are studying the efficacy of each design. It will be finalized very soon.”
