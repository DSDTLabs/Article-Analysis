HYDERABAD: The   on Friday posted to April 21 the petition filed by the investigating agency seeking cancellation of the bail granted to   president   in his disproportionate assets case. Stating that he was not trying to influence any of the witnesses in the case as was alleged by the CBI, Jagan filed a counter in the court on Friday and urged it to dismiss the plea of the CBI. 

 The CBI had moved the bail cancellation plea citing an interview aired by   wherein its journalist interviewed former   chief secretary Ramakanth Reddy. The former   expressed certain opinions on the direction of the CBI probe into the Jagan assets case. The CBI stand on this is that the interview amounts to influencing the witnesses and thereby falls squarely under the purview of violation of bail conditions.
 
 Jagan in his counter said that he is not involved in the running and management of the Sakshi media. Sakshi policies are decided by its editorial board and its journalists work in an independent manner. Attributing a portion of an interview to me and charging me with influencing the witnesses is unfair, he said.
