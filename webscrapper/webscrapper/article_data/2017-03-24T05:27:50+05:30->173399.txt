BENGALURU: Over 10,000 anganwadi workers ended their four-day protest at   late on Thursday evening after their leaders managed to wrest a commitment from CM   that he will resolve their demands and hold a special meeting with them in this regard on April 10.

 Addressing protesters after meeting the CM, Varalakshmi S, president of Karnataka Anganwadi Workers' Association, said they are suspending the protest as the government has told them it will pay a good salary. “If they fail to keep their promise, we will storm the CM's house,“ she said. Ever since protestors ar rived into the city in thousands on Monday , several rounds of unsuccessful talks were held. The protesters were demanding a wage increase from Rs 7,000 to Rs 10,000 for teachers and Rs 3,500 to Rs 7,000 for helpers.
 
 Sources in the CM's office said Siddaramaiah did not specify the quantum of hike despite insistence by the association. The chief minis ter said it was not possible as the model code of conduct for Nanjangud and Gundlupet bypolls was in force.
 
 Siddaramaiah met the workers' demands halfway by agreeing to advance his meeting with them to resolve their demands from April 19 to April 10. The by-elections are scheduled for April 9.
 
 While a section of protesters immediately headed home, another section decid ed to stay put and spend their fourth night at Freedom Park and adjacent  , before making arrangements to leave for home on Friday morning.
 
 The BMTC arranged buses to ferry the protesters to railway stations and bus stands at Yeshwanthpur, Malleswaram, Majestic and Cantonment. Their return caused traffic jams in CBD areas late evening.
