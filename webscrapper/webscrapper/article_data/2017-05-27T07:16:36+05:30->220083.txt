LUCKNOW: The first case of   (influenza A H1N1) in the city this season was reported from   on Friday. A 26-year-old man, resident of   in Sarojininagar, tested positive. His swab sample was tested twice, on May 24 and 25, at SGPGI.

 Health officials said the patient has been quarantined and recuperating at his home, while other five family members have been given Tamiflu as a precaution.
 
 Health officials suspect that the man caught the infection from his father, who died of illness on May 22. “The patient’s father had gone to Delhi on May 13 and returned to Lucknow on May 16. On his return, he complained of high fever and breathlessness. He was first taken to a physician, then to a private hospital before being admitted to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. He was later admitted to another private hospital where he passed away,” said chief medical officer, Lucknow, Dr GS Bajpai. 
 
 “We suspect the father got the infection in Delhi and passed it on to his son. We are going to enquire from the physician and the hospitals if the H1N1 test was conducted on him,”   added. 
 
 “The family was worried that people were not coming to their house due to fear and munting presuure on them to get fogging done in and around their house. We told them that fogging is done for dengue and not needed for swine flu, but they were insistent. So fogging has been done in the locality and anti-larval spray will also be done,” said additional CMO Dr SK Rawat. “The family and their neighbours have been told about the precautions to be taken,” he added.
