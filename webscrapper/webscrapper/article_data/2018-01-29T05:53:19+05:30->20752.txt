HYDERABAD: Describing the proposed measure by TRS government to put down dissent with a firm hand as a draconian step, Opposition parties said on Sunday they will launch an agitation if the state government goes ahead with implementing it.

 Earlier, chief minister   had signed on a file aimed at crushing any form of dissent against him, his cabinet colleagues and the TRS government. The measure empowers police to book criminal cases suo motu against those criticizing or levelling allegations against CM KCR, ministers and TRS government, even if there's no complaint from any quarter. It also gives discretion to the state government to initiate action directly against those indulging in criminal intimidation under Sections 506 and 507 of Indian Penal Code without the need to seek approval of court.
 
 As per existing provisions of law, police will have to first file a petition in court seeking approval to register cases against those indulging in offences under Sections 506 and 507 of IPC. For the new measure to be implemented, a government order (GO) has to be issued and sources in the state government said the matter is now with the law department and the GO will be issued after it's cleared.
 
 "K Chandrasekhar Raohas turned into a control freak three-and-half years after assuming office. We will not accept suppressive politics and will continue to criticize and expose every failure and scam of the KCR-led TRS government in  ," state   chief   said.
