KOLKATA: The national green tribunal's ( ) eastern zone bench has asked   thermal power station ( ) to shut down three units for causing   and adjoining areas. 

 There are six 40-year-old units in KTPS, each with a capacity to generate 210 MW. Officials said they had planned to replace the plants, but it is taking time as they are done through tenders. But the court wants the power plant to replace all the units at the same time. Replacing the plants will cost the exchequer around Rs 450 crore.
 
 According to officials, shutting down of the three units might lead to a loss of 280 MW but that will not affect Kolkata and the surrounding areas. 
 
 Advocate Subroto Mookerji - who filed the petition in NGT - said that the locals were affected due to pollution from the power plant. He also mentioned that the adjoining Rupnarayan river was also getting chocked due to the untreated effluent released by KTPS. 
 
 Mookerji believes that the decision by NGT will help in reducing the pollution in the area. The petitioner added that a KTPS official has filed a defective and false affidavit stating that the power station has taken all precautionary measures to check pollution.
