Noida: Over 70 residents from  , a residential complex in  , observed a ‘black day’ to   against lack of facilities. The protesters claimed that despite being delayed by eight years, the project still lacks a swimming pool, gym and a club which has forced them to seek paid services elsewhere.

 The residents said the builder had promised amenities to the residents two years ago when a handful of apartments were handed over.
 
 “We have been protesting continuously for the past few months. Not only are the facilities not available, the builder today disrupted our protests. We refuse to stop this movement and will start a hunger strike on May 6,”  , a resident, said.
 
 Hussain Jafer, general manager of Panchsheel, said: “We have heard their complaints. The project is incomplete and is still under construction. We are trying our best to deliver all facilities as soon as possible. We have conveyed this to the buyers today.” 
 
 Launched in 2010, the apartments were supposed to be completed by 2013. The complex hosts 800 flats of which 150 are presently occupied. The residents complain that the lack of basic amenities have now forced them to seek these facilities in other apartments in the neighbourhood.
 
 “Children are swimming in other pools, people are taking gym subscriptions elsewhere. Even as the apartments have been delayed by eight years, we continue to suffer. We are still not sure by when all the facilities are going to be handed over,”  , a resident, said.“
