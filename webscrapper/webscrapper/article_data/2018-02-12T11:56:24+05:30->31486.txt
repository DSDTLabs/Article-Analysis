PUNE:   fresh flowers are making a quiet statement among a section of flower lovers.

 Along with roses, carnations, violets and white orchids or gerberas, newer and exotic flowers like Asiatic and Oriental lilium, white and yellow chrysanthemum, violet eustoma, a variety of tulips, a newer range of orchids, purple iris, lilac brassica and colourful alstroemeria are peeking out from bouquets and decorations.
 
 A wide variety of options are available at florists. “Most of these new flowers have come into the market over the last two years. When people visit the store to purchase a bouquet and see these exotic flowers on display, there is a certain inclination towards buying. Despite the cost of these flowers, people are ready to spend on something unique,”  , owner of Sayali Florist on Ferfusson College Road, said.
 
 However, it is only a section of people who are buying these flowers, Abnave said. “These flowers see a demand from only a small section of people from Pune but it is growing. People are keen on experimenting and whenever we get the opportunity, we try to bring newer flowers to the store. We are trying to create a niche by offering more variety of exotic flowers than traditional ones at our store. Though these flowers are expensive, the shelf life is longer and people are not reluctant in buying them,” he said.
 
 Only a handful of florists from the city are dealing in exotic flowers due to the cost factor. 
 
 Owner of Feelings,  , said, “Sometimes, we get one bunch and only a couple of stems get sold. The expenses are high in such circumstances. Though customers are looking for exotic flowers, the demand is not too high. There is a need to build this market in Pune.”
 
  of   in   said new flowers are changing the market. 
 
 “Only two types of orchids were sold in the market but now so many varieties have come in. When people see them, they buy,”   said.
