Panaji: A Gujarat-based company intends to organize a music and art festival at Candolim during the last week of December.  The proposal was discussed by the state-level permission committee (SLPC) of the tourism department on Monday, and the organizers were directed to change their dates and submit a fresh proposal. An official who was part of the meeting said no decision has been taken yet, but the organizers have been asked for an NOC from the owner/comunidade having land rights of the respective property. The official added it is not a full-fledged electronic dance music (EDM) festival but a music festival with “some elements of EDM”.  Regarding another proposal by Sudarshan Entertainment, to organise a three-day ‘Time out music festival’ at Vagator from December 27 to 29, the official said the organizer is yet to submit a fresh proposal even as it has started selling tickets to the event. While giving an in-principle approval, it was asked to make a fresh proposal along with an NOC from the comunidade, the official said.
