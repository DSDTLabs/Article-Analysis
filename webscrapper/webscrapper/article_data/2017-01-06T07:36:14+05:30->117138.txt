Once the victim agrees to share details, the fraudsters convince the victim that a verification code would be sent to them. Usually , there are two modes of communication used to initiate such attacks.
 
 In the first method, the culprits make either a telephone or   (VoIP) call, while in the second, the culprits send an email persuading the victim to make a call on a given telephone number.
 
 Then, the fraudsters make a direct call on the victim's registered number and solicit personal and financial information posing as bank officials. This call could also be an automated call similar to one that we receive from a customer care.
