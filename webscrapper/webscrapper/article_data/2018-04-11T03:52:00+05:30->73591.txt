Nagpur: The Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) on Tuesday chose Essel Group as the joint venture partner to develop the Gorewada International Zoo, giving the 452 crore project a fresh lease of life. In January 2017, Essel executives and officials had visited Gorewada to explore things and had showed interest in developing the project. The state government was also in talks with Essel to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) through a joint venture (JV). After five tenders, only two -- Eseel and Arihand Industrial Coorporation -- had shown interest. Since, Essel made the highest bid, the company was chosen, said sources.

The JVP will be set up under public private partnership (PPP) mode with the government stake at 51% and Essel picking up the rest.
