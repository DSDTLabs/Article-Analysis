THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   by the Army across the Kallada river, connecting  , will be opened to traffic on Monday. Only   will be allowed on the bridge. Chief minister   will inaugurate the bridge which was built in parallel to the damaged Enathu Bridge. 

 The construction of the 54.50-metre-long bridge with a width of 3.5 metres has come as a major relief to commuters on the Thiruvananthapuram-Adoor route as the traffic along the way was diverted after the closure of the Enathu bridge on January 10. The Bailey bridge will be put into use till the PWD completes the repair works at the Enathu bridge.
 
 The Army started construction of the Bailey bridge on Monday and completed a major portion of it within a day. PWD minister G Sudhakaran had visited the Enathu bridge three months ago on the day it was reported that it had developed a crack. The minister had sought the opinion of retired IIT professor Dr P K Aravindan on repairing the bridge. He had also written to the Union defence minister seeking the Army's help for constructing a Bailey bridge.
 
 Subsequently, a team of Army officials, led by Lt colonel P Ravi Rajendran visited the site and began the work. Though the Army brought materials for construction of the bridge on March 20, it received the consent from the Delhi headquarters only on April 2.
