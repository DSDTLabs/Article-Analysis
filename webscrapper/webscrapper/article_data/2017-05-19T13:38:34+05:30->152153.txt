Vishal Bhardwaj’s much-anticipated 'Rangoon', which releases tomorrow, will see three stellar performers —  , Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor — coming together for the first time. The story, set against the backdrop of World War II, is a love triangle with each protagonist playing a unique, multi-layered character. Kangana, who plays Miss Julia, is said to have given her all to the role. Julia is a daredevil stuntwoman, sophisticated socialite and an undaunted lover, but her naiveté is her weakness. Saif has donned the hat of Rusi Billimoria, a manipulative and shrewd producer who selfishly loves Miss Julia.

 The actor’s last outing with Vishal was 'Omkara' (2006), and his portrayal of   is considered to be among his finest till date. Shahid’s portrayal of  , we hear, will remind viewers of the quintessential angry young man of Bollywood. His raw intensity brings to life the strength of a soldier, who will fight till the end. 'Rangoon', presented by Viacom18 Motion Pictures,   Pictures and  , releases tomorrow.
