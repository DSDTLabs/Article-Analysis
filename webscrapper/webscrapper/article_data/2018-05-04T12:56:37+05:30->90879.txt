Kaushik Ganguly’s   is a mature love story. It revolves around the life of a successful lawyer, Jiyon Mitra ( ), who is married to Rumki ( ). Srimoti Sen ( ) seeks Mr Mitra’s help in a complicated legal case, for which she has to meet him often.CT spoke to Churni about her character and experience of working with  , Rituparna and Kaushik. Excerpts… 

 On her character: I play Rumki, an ideal housewife who is strong and supports her family through thick and thin. A former lawyer, she leaves her profession to look after her husband and children. She stands by her husband when he is ill and tries to manoeuvre her way through the crisis that crops up between them later in the film. The audience will have to watch the film to know if Rumki compromises on her dignity or accepts her fate.
 
 On working with Prosenjit: Bumbada is truly inspiring and working with him is an honour. No mobile phones on set, no hang-ups, no starry air, punctual — that’s Prosenjit Chatterjee for you. Every aspect of his conversations during the shoot centred on the film. As a co-actor he gives a lot of space and not for once did I feel we were working together for the first time.
 
 On working with Rituparna: She is a storehouse of talent and excels the art of multitasking. Though we didn’t share much screen space in the film, I’ve seen how Ritu completely transforms herself the moment she hears ‘action’. There is still a silent chemistry between Prosenjit and Rituparna, which has got beautifully translated on screen.
 
 On working with Kaushik: I’ve always felt Kaushik is more marvellous as an actor than as a director, so he can get the best out of any actor. As a director he gave me a lot of freedom to experiment with Rumki’s character. He simply conveys whatever he wants from his actors, making the job easy for us.
