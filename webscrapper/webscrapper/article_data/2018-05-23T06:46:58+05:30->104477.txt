BENGALURU: In a relief to two minority educational institutions, the   high court on Tuesday stayed the notice issued by the commissioner for public instruction directing them to admit 25% students under the   quota for 2018-19. 

 Justice A S Bopanna passed the interim order after hearing petitions filed by New Horizon Education al & Cultural Trust, Indiranagar, and  , Bengaluru. The judge also ordered notice to the state government, commissioner for public instruction, directorate of urdu and other linguistic minority schools and National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI), New Delhi. 
 
  The institutions claimed that on May 3, 2018, NCMEI rejected their applications seeking linguistic minority status, saying that it had no jurisdiction in the matter. On May 11, the education department issued notices asking them to admit 25% students under the RTE quota. The petitioner claimed both the orders were illegal and riddled with fundamental errors as the   had held that NCMEI had the power to take a decision on granting of linguistic minority status. They said admissions under the RTE quota had been closed on March 21, 2018 as per the government circular. 
 
 According to the Trust, NCMEI has failed to notice that   and the engineering college have already been declared linguistic minority firms.
