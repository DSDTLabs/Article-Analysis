MYSURU: The   authorities have stopped boating in Karanji Lake which has seen a sharp fall in water levels. The water body, one of the most popular spots in the  , is facing the wrath of the dry spell. Waterflow into the lake had increased after encroachments were removed but the lack of rainfall has led to water levels plummeting rapidly, forcing the contractor to stop boating services. However, there is adequate water for birds, claim zoo officials.

 This is for the first time in recent years that the lake's water level has fallen to such low level.   over 90 acres, the Karanji Lake has a water spread area of about 55 acres. The lake is owned by the  , which gets good revenue from sales of tickets for boating.
 
 Mysuru Zoo executive director   confirmed TOI that boating was stopped 10 days ago owing to the decreased water level. “The contractor had given a letter to us stating that he is temporarily stopping boating services as there is not enough water in the lake. Boating is given on contract every year,“ he said.
 
 Kamala said there was no dearth of water in the lake, though its level has come down because of poor rain. The inflow of visitors to the lake, however, has remained unaffected, with the children's play area and the aviary pulling the crowd.
