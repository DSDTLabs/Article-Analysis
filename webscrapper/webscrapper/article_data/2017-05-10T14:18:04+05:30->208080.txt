NEW DELHI: Mayawati-led   (BSP) on Wednesday expelled senior party leader   and his son Afzal from the party for indulging in anti-party activities.

 "Nasimuddin has also been accused of accepting money from people in return for work," BSP General Secretary and Rajya Sabha member Satish Chandra Mishra said.
 
 Siddiqui, the Muslim face of the party, was considered very close to former Uttar Pradesh chief minister  .
 
 
  Last month, in a major organisational rejig, Mayawati removed Siddiqui as Uttar Pradesh chief but later appointed him in-charge of Madhya Pradesh.
 
 BSP suffered a humiliating defeat in the recently concluded Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. The party managed to secure only 19 seats out of the total 403 seats. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party failed to win even a single seat.
