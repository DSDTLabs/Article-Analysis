AHMEDABAD: Two days after it sought protection to release the   in Gujarat, the   company on Friday withdrew its petition from the   high court.

 Requesting the high court to allow it to withdraw the petition, Viacom 18   submitted, “The matter need not be adjudicated on merits since, at this stage, neither the apprehension nor the grievance, as voiced in the petition, survives for the present.” Justice J B Pardiwala allowed the film company to withdraw the application with permission to file it afresh if it feels the need for it, sources said.
 
 
 
 A day after seeking an urgent hearing on its petition for directions to the state government to facilitate the peaceful release of the film, Viacom surprisingly sought a week’s time from the court to proceed further in the case. The court posted a hearing for February 7. However, the film production company turned up one day later to withdraw the case. In its petition, the company contended that all distributors and exhibitors were willing to screen the film, but the violence deterred them from doing so from fear of attack.
