Vadodara: When the Government Railway Police (GRP) men board the train for their patrolling duty these days, they ensure that they carry a tablet with them. 

 Each member of the patrolling party reaches out to the coaches where an acrylic plate is installed. The tablet is then scanned against the acrylic plate before the cop walks to other coaches for his patrolling duty.
 
 In a bid to tackle the cases of thefts on trains and ensure that the patrolling teams don’t skip their duty, western railway SP, Sharad Singhal has taken to technology over last few days. Singhal has issued tablets to the patrolling squad members who are asked to use them daily as a proof of their attendance. “The tablets were issued about four days ago to nearly 25 cops who have daily patrolling duty. They board the trains and visit the designated spots including railway stations,” said S J Rajput, police inspector, local crime branch, Western Railway. 
 
 “The acrylic plates are installed in railway coaches as well as railway stations. The patrolling squad members scan the plate with the tablet equipped with a special software to register their presence at the particular spot at a particular time. The idea is to ensure that the members visit all the spots designated to them,” Rajput told TOI. 
 
 The patrolling squad boards 28 designated trains in the state and visits both sleeper and air-conditioned coaches. 
 
 “The GRP men also click selfies and photos of the spots they visit with the tablets that are then submitted to the department. 
 
 Having regular patrolling in train coaches will keep check on the mobile and other valuables’ thefts,” GRP officials said.
