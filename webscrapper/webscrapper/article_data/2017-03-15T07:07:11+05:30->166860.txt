PUNE: The number of overweight or   has increased by about 50% in the last three decades, according to paediatric endocrinologist  .

 “In India, it is estimated that over 5 % of children and adolescents are overweight or obese, and the prevalence is higher in urban areas and in families belonging to higher socio-economic strata,” she said while delivering her key note address at the International Diabetes Summit here on Sunday.
 
 Rapid changes in lifestyle, less physical activity and intake of more calories were reasons, Janson of   hospital, Sweden, said, adding that it has dramatically increased the incidence of type 2 diabetes among children.
 
 “There is no comprehensive population-based data on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children in India. But reports from certain centres speak of increasing occurrence. The estimates in US for new cases of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents stand at 30-50%. In Sweden, it still constitutes less than 2% of cases,” she said.
 
 Obesity surgery has a prompt effect on type 2 diabetes and is increasingly used for young patients, usually in the framework of controlled studies to evaluate the effect, Janson said.
 
 Chief endocrinologist A G   said tackling obesity in childhood is important.
