NAVI MUMBAI: With close to Rs 60,000 crore mega project investments in the taluka—some yet to take off---   CM,   comprehensively stamped the development face of the government in the third year of his rule by winning 51 out of the 78 member  .

  300-year-old  , which gradually expanded and a full-fledged corporation is now an extended Mumbai with the CST fast track elevated corridor and the sea link planned.
 
  Fadnavis had made his intention rather clear by claiming high stakes for the maiden election to Panvel city municipal corporation; historically the oldest civic body in the state established in 1852. The BJP highlighted the role of the government in notifying the formation of the corporation, after 25 years when both NMMC and PCMC were declared corporations, as also his leading from the front to get the clearances for the Rs 16,000 crore Navi Mumbai international airport.
 
 Fadnavis also won the confidence of the electorate by identifying Panvel civic body as the face of development of the government. Capping the winning streak in the local civic bodies in the state since last year, Fadnavis also made the Shiv Sena bite the dust that failed to win a single seat. 
 
  The convincing victory was also a strong rebuff to the challenge posed by grand alliance led by the BSKP that had won the Raigad ZP election and the MLC seat.
 
 Both Fadnavis and Sena supremo addressed rallies in the run-up to the election, but the determination of BJP to win the poll was evident when the two rallies at Kharghar and New Panvel targeted 57% (approx.) of the 4,25, 453 lakh voters while Udhav’s rally at Kamothe targeted just 14 % of the electorate.
 
  The BJP won all the 12 seats in three wards in Kharghar while out of the 27 seats in 7 wards in New Panvel, it bagged 24—the 36 seats it won constituted 71% of the total 51 seats it won; the half –way mark being at 40 in the new civic house. The strategy planned by  , Prashant Thakur paid off.
