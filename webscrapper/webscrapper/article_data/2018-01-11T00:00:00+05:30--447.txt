New Yeraâ€™s Eve was celebrated with aplomb at the Surya Officers Institute in Cantt. Offiers of the defence services and their families enjoyed the evening which began with an entertaining performance by the jazz band of the army. Later, a live music programme added to the fun of the evening. But people, high in spirits, waited eagerly for the DJ to begin his show and when he did, the whole dance floor was full in minutes. Apurva Srivastava, the anchor for the evening, kept the crowd involved throughout by doling out prizes for the best dancers. Lt Gen JK Sharma and Maj Gen JS Sidhana also stepped onto the dance floor to join in the celebrations. The secretary Col Sudhir Tripathi was spotted attending to the guests and ensuring the show went off without a hitch.
