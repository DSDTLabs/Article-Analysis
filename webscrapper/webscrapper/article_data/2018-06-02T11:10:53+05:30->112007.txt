TRICHY: All 41   and   in the state will be converted to government arts and science colleges, chief minister   announced in the assembly on Friday. 

 
 The state government will spend an additional 152.20 crore, relieving   of the burden of running the colleges. 
 
 The decision has been taken after constant demands from state-run arts and science universities which were facing a huge financial burden.
 
 A few months ago, the state government categorically stated that it will not start any more constituent colleges.
 
 In 2002, the government had decided to convert all government arts colleges to constituent colleges. The idea was to avoid funding government arts colleges that it ran directly, but the decision was rolled back following stiff resistance from college teachers. 
 
 Later, the concept of constituent colleges was encouraged, and this kept on adding to the financial burden of the state-run universities.
 
 Bharathidasan and Manonmaniam Sundaranar universities will benefit the most from Friday's government decision as each runs 10 constituent colleges among the total 41.
