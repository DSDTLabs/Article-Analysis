KOLHAPUR: The   ( ) has given permission to electronic rickshaw or   service in specific city areas, like the Central Bus Stand ( ) and the Mahalaxmi Temple.

 Kolhapur is well known for its pilgrimage spots such as the Mahalaxmi and Jotiba temples. The city attracts devotees from all parts of Maharashtra as well as neighbouring states. The bus services and autorickshaws are reliable modes of transportation. Passengers always accuse the autorickshaw driver of charging extra fare.
 
 Air pollution has remained high in temple premises and the city. Experts have said that this was one of the many hurdles that led to the failure of the Kirnotsav or the festival of rays. Hence, permission for e-rickshaws to ply in temple premises. 
 
 Kolhapur division regional transport officer, D T Pawar, said, “I had tabled a proposal in the meeting with the RTO. The department has given permission to the e-rickshaws in the city. This is why we selected the Mahalaxmi temple and the CBS for this service at the initial stage.” 
 
 He added that they were also considering starting a similar service in the municipal councils and nagarpanchayat areas across the district. 
 
 “These rickshaws are prohibited from operating on national highways. They have to comply with all rules in the Motor Vehicles Act. The e-rickshaw does not require any permit. They have to register with the RTO before starting their service. We have successfully implemented the service in Nagpur,” Pawar said.
 
 Environmental activist Uday Gaikwad said, “This is a progressive decision taken by the RTO. Public participation is needed to successfully implement the e-rickshaw service. Even local autorickshaw drivers should be consulted before starting this service. The temple premise is the most crowded area in city. Pollution is another major concern. It will help reduce pollution in the area.”
