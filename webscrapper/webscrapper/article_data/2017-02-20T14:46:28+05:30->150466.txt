As film watchers, we are often unaware of the interesting moments and stories that are created behind the scenes and on set. But it looks like the cast of   was pretty serious. Vouching for that, actress Suzanna Mukherjee, who will be seen in the upcoming film, says, "On set, nobody played any prank as such. It's probably because everyone was in a serious mode, since the film being made was a serious one!"

 However, the set had to 'face its own share of music'. Suzanna and her co-star   are both die-hard lovers of music. "When the rest were running around on set getting their own work done, we'd trouble them to sit down and listen to us sing songs as we strummed the guitar. Most of the work that people had during the shoot would invariably end up getting delayed, thanks to us!" the actress quipped.
 
 The film cast had a great time on set. "Between shots, we had lots of good times. Divya, Anshuman (Jha) and I hit it off really well. Even beyond   for the film, we make it a point to meet often," said Suzanna.
