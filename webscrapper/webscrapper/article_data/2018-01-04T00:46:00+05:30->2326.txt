Salem: The district BJP president R P Gopinath submitted a petition on Wednesday to divisional railway manager (DRM) Hari Shankar Verma urging him to set up a ‘Railway Park’ at Salem town railway station. 

 According to Gopinath, a piece of land owned by Southern Railway on Salem town railway station premises remains abandoned. “The land is filled with drainage turning it into a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” he said. 
 
 Gopinath suggested the DRM to set up a park for public use on the land. Hundreds of people used to come for walking in the platform areas of the town railway station. “If the Salem Railway Division sets up a park in the abandoned land, the walkers will use it,” he suggested. 
 
 Citing ‘Anna’ Park owned by the Salem Municipal Corporation, Gopinath said the park is purely meant for children. “Adults and elderly might use the railway park,” he added. The DRM also assured Gopinath that he will look into the possibility of setting up the park.
