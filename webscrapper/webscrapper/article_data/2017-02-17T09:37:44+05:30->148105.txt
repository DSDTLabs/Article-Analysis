BENGALURU:  , former principal of a Kendriya Vidyalaya school in the city and charged with sexually harassing a girl student earlier this month, has been suspended. Thakur, arrested and released on bail later, had been transferred to a  .

 Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghatan has said that the decision was based on the preliminary report of an inquiry committee that was constituted by the deputy commissioner, KVS regional office, Bengaluru, following a directive from the Sanghatan headquarters in New Delhi. “A summary probe will be conducted,“ it stated.
 
 Charged under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, Thakur was released on bail a day after his arrest.
 
 On February 2, the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) had issued an interim order to immediately suspend the principal.
 
 The order was issued after Vasudeva Sharma, director, Child Rights Trust, lodged a police complaint alleging that Thakur had been sexually harassing girl students, particularly of classes 10 and 12, over a three-year period. 
 
 However, Thakur was transferred to Karwar instead of being suspended soon after his bail, much to the angst of childrights activists. The KSCPCR had on February 13 sent summons to the commissioner of KVS to explain why the principal continued with his job. 
 
 While the commissioner was supposed to appear before the bench on Friday, the Sanghatan suspended him on Thursday. “The probe was conducted on February 9, 11, 13 and 14. The KVS headquarters received a report on Thursday following which the commissioner, KVS, placed the accused under suspension. To ensure fair probe, the KVS had earlier transferred him to Karwar,“ it said.
