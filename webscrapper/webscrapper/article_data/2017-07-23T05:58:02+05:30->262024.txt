SRINAGAR: Jammu & Kashmir chief minister   rejected the suggestion of former CM Farooq Abdullah asking India to seek the help of the United States and China to solve the Kashmir issue, saying that American intervention would be particularly disastrous.

 “There can be no place for third party intervention in J&K,” Mehbooba told reporters during her tour to hometown Anantnag on Saturday. “ Let America and China mind their own businesses.
 
 "Look at the places America has interfered in, be it Afghanistan,  , or Iraq. While China has its own problems to deal with in Tibet. We have the Lahore Declaration and the Shimla Agreement with us,” she said. “When we have to resolve the issue together (India and  ), then why do we need any third party?” the chief minister asked.
 
 “As Vajpayeeji had said in the Lahore Declaration, India and Pakistan should hold talks to resolve the Kashmir issue,” she said, and questioned: “Does Farooq Abdullah know what happened in Syria and Afghanistan (following US intervention)?” Mehbooba took an extensive tour of Anantnag district during which she laid foundation of various projects, inaugurated many other schemes and met people to learn about their problems.
