RAJKOT: One of the three poachers, who had killed a chinkara (Indian Gazelle) right in front of a large forest department team on Saturday night, was arrested from   village, adjoining the Mityala sanctuary in Amreli district. 

 Sanjay Amu Delvadia, the poacher was nabbed at around 2am on Tuesday after the department got specific information about his whereabouts. A country-made gun was also recovered from him. 
 
 However, two other poachers who had accompanied him, are still at large. They had escaped despite the presence of nearly 100 forest staffers who were mobilized by deputy conservator of forest, Gir (east), T Karuppasamy. The forest department teams of Khambha and Savarkundla are continuously searching for these two. “We have nabbed one poacher and are hopeful that to catch two others very soon. Delvadia has confessed to killing the chinkara and he had used country-made gun for poaching. My team is working tirelessly for the past three days to nab them,” Karuppasamy told TOI.
 
 The accused will be prosecuted under various sections of the Indian Wild Life Protection Act, 1967, for poaching chinkara that is protected under Schedule-I. The department is also investigating whether this gang was involved similar poaching episodes in the past.
 
 On Saturday night, a local resident Dashrathsinh Rathod had received information of some villagers noticing three people with guns venturing into the jungle. Rathod had started contacting forest department officials but got little response. After Karuppasamy mobilized teams from three ranges, nearly 100 staffers had begun a frantic hunt for the poachers. They found them but one of them fired a shot at the chinkara and killed it right in front of them and the trio escaped. While chasing poachers, they heard gunshots and went into that direction. They found the chinkara’s carcass. Forest officers also fired two rounds in the air but the offenders managed to flee.
