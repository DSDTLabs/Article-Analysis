Forget visiting   bars and roasting your own beans. Being a coffee snob may now require you to get your own style into your mug or cup! In an increasingly fun trend, coffee aficionados are asking for their own   to be added into their brew. It involves pouring steamed milk onto espressos to make various patterns — florals, abstracts, rainbows, designer logos and even copies of famous art works. South Korean artist   took coffee to the next level by creating miniatures of famous   in cups of java. The 26-year-old recreated Vincent van Gogh’s ‘The Starry Night’ and Edvard Munch’s ‘The Scream’ using thick cream with food colouring on cups of coffee. Other artists have made cartoon characters as well. 
 
 The two methods of achieving this art is through free pour and etching. In the first, you simply swirl the milk jug in circular movements into your cup. The second style will have you use special tools in order to create intricate patterns. The rule is: pouring in the center will create a centered design that moves outwards and pouring at the side will give you a snake-like trail that curves around the sides of the cup. Ready to elevate your own mug, soon?
