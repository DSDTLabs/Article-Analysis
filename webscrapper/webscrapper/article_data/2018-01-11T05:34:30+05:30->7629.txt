KOLKATA: Till recently, Shankar Shaw, Idrish Ali or   were rogue drivers. Violating traffic rules was a kind of habit for them. But on Wednesday, they became the faces of safety practices on roads after emerging as the winners of the Road Safety Game Olympiad, a first-of-its-kind initiative taken by Kolkata Police. 

 “They are now the safest road users in the city,” said a proud senior traffic police officer. On Wednesday, police chief Rajeev Kumar conferred awards to the champions of the Road Safety Game Olympiad that was held across the city since March last year. 
 
 Top three families in each of the eight categories had their proud moments while receiving awards from the commissioner, in presence of actors Dev and  . “The games were designed to test one’s traffic knowledge and skills of drivers — be it traffic signage, lane driving or automobile manoeuvring,” said   of Karmyogi , an NGO partner of police’s ‘Safe Drive Save Life’ campaign. 
 
 
  
 For the last one year, each traffic guard picked up rogue drivers and got them enrolled in the Jaago Learning Club. Each of 25 traffic guards has a room for the club where rouge drivers reorient themselves through music, meditation, audio- visual clippings and safedriving practices, said deputy commissioner (traffic)  . “The club has changed my life. I used to think cops as our enemies. They were born to punish us. When hey booked me in a case and asked me to attend the evening class, I thought they would put me behind bars. But on the first day, I got the fun and slowly started evolving as a better driver,” said auto-driver Manzar Alam.
