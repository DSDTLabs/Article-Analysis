THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM state secretary   has alleged that the   was intimidating the state   for paving way for a central interference in the state. Reacting to the statement of BJP leader   in New Delhi, the CPM state secretary said that the BJP was trying all undemocratic ways to impose control of the Centre on state governments.

 “The claim made by the BJP leaders that there is a need to impose the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in Kannur is a sign of what the BJP is eyeing at in Kerala. The BJP has imposed this in several north Indian states to gain control over the states,” said Kodiyeri.
 
 Law and order is always a state government subject but the BJP is politicising it to get the Centre to intervene in this and that was the reason why the BJP leaders went and submitted a memorandum seeking the intervention of the governor.
 
 There was no need for imposing any kind of armed forces act and the law and order situation in Kerala is well under the control of the state government. But the BJP wants to exert pressure on the government to intervene in the issue since they have vested interests, alleged Kodiyeri.
