VADODARA: The chorus for awarding ministries to senior legislators grew stronger with Shehra BJP   Bharwad’s supporters raising the demand to give a berth to the five-time MLA.

 Jetha, however, said that he was not eyeing any such post.
 
 The demonstrations were held at the   party office at Shehra on Wednesday and the supporters raised the demand stating that he was a senior MLA and deserved to be in the cabinet. But no hints regarding a rebellion were dropped by the supporters.
 
 While   agreed that some of his supporters had gathered at the party office, he said that he had learnt about this only from the TV news. “They may have some expectations, but I have no such demand. I was not in Shehra when this happened,” he said.
 
 He said that after the incident, he had been forced to issue clarifications. He pointed out that no further protests had taken place on Thursday and added that he would speak to his supporters over the weekend during his visit to Shehra.
 
 Sources said that the former cop has been telling his aides that he may not contest polls in the future. Jetha has been a MLA since 1995 when he was elected as a   candidate.
