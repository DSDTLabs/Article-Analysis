AHMEDABAD: Gynaecologists from the city and the state have joined hands to be part of the national movement — Green the Red — to create awareness about sustainable menstruation hygiene choices.   (AOGS) has so far conducted six seminars and will conduct more when schools and colleges open for the new academic year.

 
 
 The members said that it is an apt time to talk about the topic as May 28 was observed as the Menstrual Hygiene Day and June 5 will mark the World Environment Day (WED). This year’s theme for WED is ‘Beat  .’
 
 Dr Jayprakash Shah, the president of AOGS, said that the initiative aims to save the planet and inculcate sustainable habits. “If not disposed properly, sanitary pads pose a major hazard to the environment,” he said. “We want to encourage citizens to adopt greener choices.”
 
 AOGS members said that a woman uses about 6,000 disposable sanitary pads in her lifetime. Most of them end up at landfill sites. Studies showed that a city of the size of Bengaluru produces about 90,000kg of sanitary waste per day. The best way to dispose the pads is to incinerate them at a temperature above 800°C. But such incinerators are not freely available. If not burnt properly, the pads emanate dioxins, which can cause cancer.
 
 Dr Rajal Thaker, the vice-president of AOGS, said that the pads are made of plastics and chemicals and cause infections and rashes. “We advise options such as reusable cloth pads and menstrual cups which can be used multiple times. As we put it, the use of such options result in trash-free, rash-free, and cash-free periods,” said Thaker.
 
 Dr Kamini Patel, the secretary of AOGS, said that over the past month, six awareness seminars have been organized covering 200 to 300 participants in each of the events. “The seminars dispel myths and help women make informed choices.”
