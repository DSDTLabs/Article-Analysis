It is not often that a first-time filmmaker���s film, with no major star in its cast, gets more screens on the second week of its release. But   has managed to do that with his thriller  , which stars actor  , and has won acclaim from both the critics and the public. Talking about what the spark of the film was, the 22-year-old director says, ���I start writing after I arrived at what the core of the film was. In this film, it was: ���What do people do when their emotion is at a peak?���. Even though this can be made into a psychological drama, I wanted to do it as a cop story, one where the police are also like normal people. Being a storyteller, I developed this idea into a thriller that keeps the audience hooked from start to finish.���

 He says that he roped in Rahman for the central character because he wanted a ���middle-aged actor who is also a good performer���. Given that he was just 20 when he began the film, he admits that people were hesitant to come forward to produce it. But he adds that one cannot blame them for that. ���Cinema is a multi-crore business. The director has to guide everyone working on the film. So, when a 20-year-old asks someone to give him a couple of crores to shoot a film, they are bound to have doubts,��� explains Karthick, who produced the 
 film himself. 
 
 The film has been winning appreciation from the likes  , AR Rahman, AR Murugadoss, Sundar C, and Parthiban. ���I had doubts if people would accept the film, but thanks to word-of-mouth publicity, the screens started filling up. That has given me a satisfaction as a creator and a producer. This has reaffirmed my conviction to make quality films,��� signs off the young filmmaker.
