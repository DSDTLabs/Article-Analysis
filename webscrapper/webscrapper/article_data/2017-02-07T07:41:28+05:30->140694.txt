PATIALA: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( ) has set up a three member committee to probe the issue of Dera Sacha Sauda announcing support to the SAD-BJP alliance in the   assembly polls.

 SGPC president   said the SGPC formed the committee on the directions of Akal Takht jathedar   to launch an investigation into the matter.
 
 SGPC members Baldev Singh, Amarjit Singh Chawla and Gurcharan Singh Grewal have been asked to find out who had approached the Dera to seek support for the SAD-BJP combine.
 
 Asked if SAD chief   would also be brought under the scanner, Badungar said, “It is the prerogative of the Akal Takht jathedar.“ When asked whether the issue will have any impact on the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee elections due this month, he said it was be too early to make an assumption.
 
 Sirsa-headquartered Dera Sacha Sauda had on Wednesday announced support for the SAD-BJP combine for the February 4 assembly polls.
 
 “The Dera had left it to its followers to take a call on which political party to support. Accordingly, they (followers) have decided to support the Akali Dal and BJP candidates in Punjab,“ Dera's political affairs wing member Ram Karan had claimed.
