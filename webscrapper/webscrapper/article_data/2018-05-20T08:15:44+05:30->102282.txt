 Congress workers led by former   held a victory celebration outside District Congress Committee office. They burst crackers and shouted slogans even as they received the news that JD(S)-Congress would form the government on Monday. 
 
 For the first time, Congress workers shouted slogans praising JD(S) president H  , who will be sworn-in as the chief minister. 
 
 They celebrated the victory soon after B S Yeddyurappa announced his decision to resign as chief minister. Congress workers also shouted slogans praising party campaign committee head D K Shivakumar.
 
 Lobo told reporters that Yeddyurappa has created a history by resigning from chief minister's post even before seeking the vote of confidence. 
 
 "This is the first instance, where a chief minister has resigned due to lack of self-confidence. Though   is fully aware that they lack majority, their desire for power forced them to seek vote of confidence," he said.
 
 BJP has misused all powers and paved the way for horse trading in Karnataka, but they have failed miserably, he said.
 
 In the meantime, JD(S) workers too celebrated by distributing sweets near their party office in Bendoorwell in the city.
 
 Communist Party of India (CPI), which extended its support to Congress in the election, termed Yeddyurappa's resignation as a victory of democracy.
 
 CPI district secretary   said, "Inviting BJP to form government itself was a wrong decision and it amounts to murder of democracy. The governor should immediately invite H D Kumaraswamy to form a new government."
