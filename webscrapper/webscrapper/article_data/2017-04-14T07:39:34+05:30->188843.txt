DHARWAD: With a possible decline in   this season, the tendency among sellers to ripen the fruit quickly, using chemicals and scale up the sales to make a quick buck is on the rise.

 While they use   to  ,   say that using the chemical is injurious to health as it may lead to cancer. Experts have cautioned mango lovers to be careful while buying the fruit and have suggested consumption of the naturally-ripened fruit. “Calcium carbide reacts with the moisture emanated by the respiration of the fruit. It liberates a gas called acetylene which helps in ripening the fruit. This gas is carcinogenic, an agent that has the ability to alter human cells into cancer cells,” said a farm scientist.
 
 He advised sellers to use ethrel, which is safe, to ripen mangoes. “The   gas, liberated by applying   helps ripen any fruit. Since it is costly, sellers go for calcium carbide,” he said. 
 
 Gynaecologist and progressive  , Dr Sanjeev Kulkarni explained that calcium carbide leads to skin allergies and rashes and at times can also cause severe disease like skin cancer. “Since most of the fruits procured from the market are artificially ripened, the only way to skim the carbide content is to wash the fruits properly,” he said.
 
 Admitting that it will be difficult for a layman to detect the application of calcium carbide in fruits, Dr Kulkarni suggested that the government take steps to check the use of the harmful chemical for ripening fruits. 
 
 Deputy director of the horticulture department, S B Doddimani said efforts are being made to sensitize fruit growers and sellers on the dangers of using chemicals to ripen fruits. 
 
 “They are being encouraged to go for natural ripening. But still, traders use calcium carbide which is punishable under the law,” he said, adding that the department would take action against those found using calcium carbide for ripening mangoes.
