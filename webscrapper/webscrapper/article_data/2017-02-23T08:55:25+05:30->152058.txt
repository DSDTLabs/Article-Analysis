MANGALURU: The war of words over   Pinarayi Vijayan’s visit to the city is only growing louder. 

 With Left parties and the organisations ideologically- affiliated to them welcoming Vijayan’s scheduled visit to address a communal amity rally at   on Saturday, the pro-Hindu organizations have raised the anti-pitch by giving a call for a hartal on that day. The district   unit has declared support to the day long hartal.
 
 Asserting that   does not need a lesson in communal amity from Vijayan who presently heads a state known for its culture of political killings, BJP district president  , said that the BJP as a political party will support the call given by the Hindu organisations. “The rank and file of pro-Hindu organizations are upset at the spiral of political killings ever since the Vijayan-led government came to power,” he said.
 
 Sanjeeva said the party has also decided to be part of a protest rally organized by the Hindu organizations on Friday in this regard. “Our party workers from all five taluks of the district will attend the rally in large numbers,” he asserted.
 
 In a related development, V Kukkyan, district secretary, CPI, said that his party will support the communal amity rally. There is a need for such programmes to ease the situation in the district, he said adding the party regrets the opposition to the same from Hindu organisations. Noting that political killings in Kerala are indeed a matter of regret, he, said it is not just members of Hindu organisations, but even the Left cadre who are getting killed there, he added.
