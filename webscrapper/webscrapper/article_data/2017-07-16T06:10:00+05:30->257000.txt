LUDHIANA: Union finance minister   avoided speaking on the burning issue of GST during his visit to city on Saturday and instead spoke on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and plans of his government to provide all basic facilities in all the villages of the country.

 Attending a programme at Sat Paul Mittal School, Jaitley addressed the audience which comprised businessmen, sarpanch of several villages and government officials.
 
 The minister said, “The initiative of making toilets undertaken by Bharti foundation is highly appreciable and I think all corporate should follow this example and spend a fraction of their earnings for social causes. Making true the dream of Prime Minister   of building toilets in every single household has been a very challenging task and government officials have worked on war footing to make it a reality.
 
 “The campaign started as a small campaign and has become almost a nationwide movement. But we still have to go a long way in this journey,” he added.
 
 Jaitley also said, “One of the reasons of me coming to Ludhiana is to encourage businessmen, public sector enterprises of the city and state who are in profit, to come forward and take up similar missions. It is estimated that Rs 14-15,000 crore can be made available by corporate sector under corporate social responsibility and no mission is impossible if we club it with the help that can be made available from the government.”
 
 He also added, “It will be wrong to say that nothing has been done in India in the past 70 years. In fact if you look at the situation now, our country has become the favourite destination for   Our government has taken upon the challenge of providing electricity to every village in India by 2018 and by 2019 we intend to connect all villages with metaled roads and ensure that every village household has a toilet.”
