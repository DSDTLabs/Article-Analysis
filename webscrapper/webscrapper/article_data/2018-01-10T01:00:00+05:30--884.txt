Director Anurag Kashyap’s ' ', which hits screens on January 12, will see   making her Bollywood debut. After being a part of the theatre circuit, the actress chose to step into cinema not with a quintessential girl-next-door role in a commercial film, but with the sports drama in which she will be essaying the character of a small-town girl who is mute.

 About learning sign language from Sangeeta Gala (a deaf person, Sangeeta has trained many B-Town actors to play hearing and speech-impaired characters) for the film, Zoya reveals that the disability of her character symbolises the lack of voice that women have in our society.She adds, “I had a huge responsibility to be true to myself, portray the character that the film wanted, and over and above, show respect to the differently-abled people in the world.” 
 
 Presented by Eros International & Aanand L Rai and produced by Colour Yellow Productions in association with Phantom Films, 'Mukkabaaz' is the love story of a boxer, which features   as the protagonist along with   and Ravi Kishan.
