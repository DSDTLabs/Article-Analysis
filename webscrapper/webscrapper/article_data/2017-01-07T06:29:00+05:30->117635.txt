 Janardhan started collecting items 30 years ago -- ink wells, fountain pens, blotting equipment, quills and books on calligraphy.

He also owns a few rare pens released by Mont Blanc, commemorating famous personalities who have passed on.

 “People no longer write as much as they used to because of the digital revolution. They prefer texting or typing over writing; while this increases connectivity it lacks the personal touch. If there is any power cut or natural disaster, people would not know how to communicate with each other since they are so dependent on technology. But with the advent of smartphones that come with a stylus, it seems as if we are coming back to writing by hand,” he adds.
