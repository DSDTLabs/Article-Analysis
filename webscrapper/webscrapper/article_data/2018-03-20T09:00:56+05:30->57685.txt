MUSSOORIE: A 72-year-old   was hit by a   near   leaving him with three fractures after which residents of Mussoorie on Monday demanded a crack down on   in the area.
 
  The incident occurred on Sunday when Pramod Kapoor was walking home. “He was hit by a bike and now has three fractures on the left ankle. He has also been advised eight weeks of bed rest,” said Kapoor’s nephew Rajat. Such incidents have become frequent of late, he added.
  
  On Monday, 50 residents met SHO (Mussoorie) Bhawna Kainthola and asked her to act against those speeding or driving rashly, drivers without licences and overloaded trucks.
  
  Recently, over 30 people have written to the ADG (law and order) complaining about people breaking traffic rules in Mussoorie.
  
  Gone are the days when one could take an evening stroll on the Mall Road here, according to Sanjiv Verma, who has a shop on the Mall Road and suffered severe chest injuries when a bike rammed his store last October.
  
  Manoranjan Tripathi, 65, said, “There is complete lawlessness here. Nobody is checking whether drivers have licences, if they are wearing helmets, or if they are driving at safe speed.”
