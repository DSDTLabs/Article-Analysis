KOLKATA: Had chief minister   held the meeting with private hospitals earlier, I might not have lost my daughter, said Sultana Begum, whose 16-year-old daughter,  , died at CMRI apparently owing to alleged medical negligence. “I do not think state health officials keep a tab on private health facilities,” she said. “Hope lessons are learnt from my daughter’s death and no other family has to contend with such an avoidable tragedy.”

 The news of her death had led to a violent rampage at the hospital by local youths. In fact, after the ransacking and the allegation of malpractice by  , did Mamata decide to hold the meeting with private health facilities. 
 
 “I know Mamata Didi held a meeting. But I lost my teenaged daughter. Can anyone compensate for my loss?” said Sultana. “The ransacking wasn’t right but local men went berserk, hearing my daughter’s death due to medical negligence.” 
 
 Sultana, who are yet to come to terms with Saika’s death, asked, “Why did the doctors flee after she died?” She said Saika was first taken to a nearby nursing home with abdominal pain. “As the specialist was not there, some neighbours suggested we should take her to CMRI,” she said. 
 
 “There, ICU doctors said they had to perform a surgery on Saika who had gastrointestinal perforation. Later at night, my daughter said her pain had reduced, but she was still taken to the OT, without us being told. I could not even speak to her the last time, she said. ” She pointed out all they wanted was a clarification, but the doctors had already fled. “We felt something was wrong. We wanted to meet the doctors but they refused. So we did not claim her body. Some CMRI staffers threatened they would throw her on the road, which triggered violence.”
