Vadodara: A proposal to convert M S University’s Baroda Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya (BSM) – a college into a full-fledged faculty was recently referred back.  Sources suggest that the proposal was referred back during the faculty board meeting of Faculty of Arts recently. The university’s syndicate body has already cleared the proposal to give BSM a separate faculty status in principal. But when the proposal was brought for discussion during the faculty board meeting some members raised concerns regarding the fate that such a decision will eventually meet.  In all this years, even as Faculty of Journalism and Communication Studies have received a separate status, the faculty has had to struggle a lot when it comes to getting treatment similar to the rest of the faculties of the university.  Some members in the faculty board suggested that the university should not take such a decision in haste. Instead, BSM officials have been asked to provide sufficient data regarding the number of students that take admission in various courses, how many do actually appear in exams and its staff strength.  It is worth mentioning here that many a times, student leaders take admission in some courses of BSM to become eligible to contest in the MSU Students Union elections or simply get identity cards but later don’t even bother to appear in the exams.
