CHENNAI: The Chennai police booked owners of the high-end cars impounded on Sunday morning on the   for rash and negligent driving, preventing government servants from discharging their duties and causing noise pollution. They were let off on station bail late on Sunday.

 The cars, including Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche, were seized by the Neelankarai traffic enforcement wing. Police said the cars were   on ECR.
 
 Police said the cars will be inspected by two motor vehicle inspectors on Tuesday. “The check is basically to find out whether the cars have been modified to indulge in racing. It the tests prove so, the vehicles will be sent to the judicial magistrate in Alandur and action will be taken as per the law,” said a senior police officer.
 
 The seized cars have been parked in a shed behind the Kanathur police station. The high-end vehicles have attracted the local crowd which has been busy taking selfies.
 
 The car drivers have been booked under IPC sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of duty) and Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, sections 184 (driving dangerously), 189 (racing and trials of speed), 190 (2) (any person who drives or causes or allows to be driven, in any public place a motor vehicle, which violates the standards prescribed in relation to road safety, control of noise and air-pollution) and 177 (general provision for punishment of offences).
 
 Police said the car owners were stopped near Akkarai after they refused to cooperate with them. The car drivers had said they were within the speed limit of 60kmph on the stretch notorious for drag racing. They said they were heading to a breakfast event that a car company had organised for luxury vehicle owners. An officer said police had proof that the cars were speeding.
