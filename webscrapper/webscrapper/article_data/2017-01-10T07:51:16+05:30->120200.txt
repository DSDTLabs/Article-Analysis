THIRIVANANTHAPURAM:   who threatened to go on mass leave on Monday to protest the LDF government's alleged arm-twisting methods, dutifully turned up at their respective offices after chief minister   warned them that he would not countenance any pressure tactics from bureaucrats. 

 Vijayan expressed his strong displeasure over the decision taken by the IAS officers who went into protest mode, alleging abuse of power and a vindictive attitude by vigilance director Jacob Thomas.
 
 The chief minister voiced his displeasure to eight senior IAS officers who met him in his chamber on Monday morning. They met him to apprise the context under which the officers met on Saturday and took the decision to avail casual leave on Monday. The officers, who did not want a confrontation with the government, resumed their duties.
 
 "The government has clarified that it is not ready to tread a certain line under pressure. But they have replied that they have no such intention and the government wholeheartedly accepts their stand. What has happened should not have happened. One cannot justify the protest method adopted by those at the helm of the administration," Vijayan said after the meeting.
 
 The officers, led by additional chief secretary (finance) KM Abraham, told Vijayan that the protest was not against any probe, but against the non-compliance of due process of law and to publicity that tarnished the officer even before it was found that he was guilty or not.
