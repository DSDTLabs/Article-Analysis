KOTTAYAM: In a unique move, the   mission here has launched a campaign to form  . As part of it, the first group in the district and the second one in the state, after Ernakulum, will be inaugurated at the Kudumbashree office on February 9.

 As many as 10 transgenders are part of the group. Since they hail from different parts of the district, the group will be registered in a panchayath as per their convenience.
 
 According to the gender consultant of the district  , more   units of transgenders will be formed with the help of the members of first unit. The programme is launched with the support of the district legal service authority. “There are around 375 transgenders in the district and we chose 10 from them. We had invited five of them to share their experience with us last week,” she said.
 
 “The main aim of this project is to give them a chance to come out of the shell,” she said.
 
 Kudumbashree, launched by the state government in 1998, is the largest women-empowerment project in the country. At present there are over 40 lakh members. 
 
 The Kudumbashree unit here is also planning to form special groups of the aged as well as physically challenged.
