Mangaluru: Prime Minister Narendra   elevated city-based artist Karan Acharya’s repute to a higher orbit on Saturday, even as the jam-packed crowd at the Nehru Maidan here cheered for the 29-year-old’s talent.

 Acharya’s angry half-vermilion half-black image of Hanuman had created a rage across the country. The image attained such popularity that two years later, it continues to adorn smartphones as a display picture, while it is a preferred choice of youth across the country on windshields, T-Shirts and rear windows of their automobiles. 
 
 “I want to applaud artist   whose Hanuman portrait has captured the imagination of people across India. This is a laudable achievement and is the power of his achievement, talent and imagination. This is the pride of Mangaluru. All TV channels queued up for his interview,” Modi said in Mangaluru.
 
 “However, the vector image has not gone down well with a section of the political arena, which painted it with a communal angle,” Modi said. 
 
 Recalling this, Modi did not mince words to slam the Congress. “The Congress’ ecosystem doesn’t even tolerate the magnificent art of Karan Acharya whose Hanuman captured the imagination of the entire country. Unable to digest its success, the Congress tried miring it in a controversy. There is no iota of democracy in the minds of Congress members,” Modi said, and added that such a party does not deserve to rule Karnataka even for a day.
 
 Twiiterati, too, was quick enough to come in support of this iconic art and Modi. “The liberals will now intensify their campaign against ‘angry Hanuman’ and hard-line Hindutva of Modi #BreakingBangles (sic),” a Twitter user said.
