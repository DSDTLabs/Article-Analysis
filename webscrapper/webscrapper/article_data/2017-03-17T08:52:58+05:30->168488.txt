CHANDIGARH: Buoyed by favourable legal opinion, the Chandigarh administration has finally de-notified V1 (fast roads connecting Chandigarh to other towns), V2 (arterial roads) and V3 roads (fast vehicular sector dividing roads) as state highways.

 The administration, however, has not changed the status of Madhya Marg, which will continue to be a state highway as it provides direct connection between Chandigarh and different towns of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.   passes through sectors 1214, 1115, 1016, 917, 818, 719, 2627 and 2628. The other roads only have intra-city traffic.
 
 The move aims at saving liquor vends that were facing closure due to the notification by the engineering department in 2006, declaring V1, V2 and V3 roads as state highways. UT administrator VP   accorded approval to the decision.
 
 A three-judge bench, headed by the then Chief Justice TS Thakur of  , on a petition filed by Harman Sidhu, president of Arrive Safe, a city-based NGO on road safety , had passed an order on December 15 that liquor vends must be at least 500 metres away from state and national highways from April 1.
 
 In Chandigarh, NH-21 passes through sectors 2930, 3032, 2033, 2134, 2235, 2336, 3435, 3741 and 3938.
 
 With this, around 30 vends operating on Madhya Marg and National Highway-21 will be closed. The Time of India had first reported on February 5 about the liquor shops facing closure.
 
 To wriggle out of the situation, the administration had constituted a seven-member committee, comprising UT chief engineer,   chief engineer, UT chief architect, superintending engineer and assistant excise and taxation commissioner Ravinder Kaushik, which recommended change of nomenclature of state highways to major district roads. Before making the change, the administration sought legal opinion from its senior standing counsel, who stated that the administration was well within its rights to change the nomenclature. As per the opinion, any change in nomenclature would not be in contravention of the   order.
