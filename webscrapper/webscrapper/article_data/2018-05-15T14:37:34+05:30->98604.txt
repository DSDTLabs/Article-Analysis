NAGPUR: The BJP-led ruling alliance at the   (NMC) has failed to keep its promise of holding special meeting of the general body to solve the issue of contaminated drinking water supply.   also continues to plague the city.

 During the last general body meeting on April 20, corporators from all political parties, including  , raised the issue of contaminated water supply and crisis. Ruling party leader   assured on the floor of the House to hold a special meeting to resolve the issue in May. Mayor Nanda Jichkar also assured the corporators raising the issue. But the special meeting has not been organized yet.
 
 Every month, regular meeting is organized on or before 20th. For holding the meeting, the agenda has to be issued seven days before. The date for issuing the agenda also passed away.
 
 Jichkar did not respond to TOI’s call.
 
 Opposition leader Tanaji Wanve said BJP was not at all serious about any problems of the city and is enjoying power. “Citizens are facing severe problems due to contaminated water supply and crisis for the last two months. The summer will come to an end next month. The ruling party should have taken the issues seriously this month itself,” he said.
 
 Wanve said the office-bearers neglected holding the meeting despite being reminded time and again since the beginning of the month. “There will be no meaning of directives issued in the general body if the meeting is held in the last week of May. Around 15 days are required to prepare minutes of the meeting and send them for implementation. Till then, the monsoon will arrive,” he said.
 
 Senior BJP corporator   said water crisis has continued in his ward. “I pursued the problems with NMC and OCW officials after last month’s general body meeting. I had to suggest measures to solve the problems. Some issues were sorted out but a few remained as it is,” he said.
 
 Last month, Holey had said that Jichkar had no control over the administration.
