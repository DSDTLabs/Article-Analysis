LUCKNOW: A class XI student allegedly hanged himself at his home in   on Monday afternoon. 

 The deceased,   (16), lived his family in a rented house in   locality. His mother Shanti does menial work at a private school while his father Umesh is a tempo driver. Adarsh studied at an inter college in Aminabad. 
 
 Adarsh's relative   came to his house on Monday afternoon and found the doors locked. When repeated knocking did not evoke any response, he called the neighbours. They broke open the doors and found Adarsh hanging from the ceiling in his room. He was taken to a hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 Investigation officer   said Adarsh flunked his class XI exams whose results were declared on Monday. "He was probably upset with his results and hence ended his life," Prasad said. The body had been sent for autopsy and further investigation was on.
