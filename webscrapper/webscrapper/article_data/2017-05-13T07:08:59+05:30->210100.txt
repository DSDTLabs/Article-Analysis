NEW DELHI: Lying in the hospital after getting shot at outside his house in  , 30-year-old   (name changed) scanned through the list of people who might have a grudge against him. But little did he know that the attack was the handiwork of a   who was insanely in love with his wife. The bullet had fractured his collarbone after narrowly missing his chest.

 His family had arranged his marriage with   (name changed) after matching their horoscopes. Rakesh owns a petrol pump and real estate business.
 
 On February 4, while he was out on an evening walk with his wife, he heard something that sounded like a gunshot. “I thought it was the sound of a motorbike’s exhaust and ignored it. Later, someone from our colony found an empty bullet shell from the spot. We did not register a police complaint then,” Rakesh said.
 
 Rakesh had almost forgotten about the incident when on April 20 a man on a bike stopped ahead of him and fired at him with a pistol while he was walking with his wife. “Fortunately, the bullet hit my shoulder,” he said. He was admitted to a hospital and underwent surgery.
 
 Shortly after, someone threw a piece of paper in Sonia’s parents’ house threatening to kill Rakesh and his family members. “We freaked out and asked Sonia to quit her job. She remained almost locked up in the house. We also informed the SHO who assured us protection,” said a family member.
 
 “I have been counselling Sonia since the stalker’s arrest. I might take her to a hill station for a change,” Rakesh said.
