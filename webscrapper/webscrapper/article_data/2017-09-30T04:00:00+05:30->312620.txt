 Four accused identified as Hetal Umraniya (30), a resident of Rudanagar, Balwant Chawda (30), a resident of Maninagar, Jaideep Sidiya (22), a resident of Mafatiyapara, and Mukesh Solanki (32), a resident of Gujarat Housing Board quarters, and booked them under Sections 392, 365, 384, 170, 506 (2), 504 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code. 
 
 Complainant Manish Fefar (40), a resident of Sattadhar Society 2 in Morbi, alleged that two months ago he had received a call from a woman offering him friendship with another woman. The woman sent him a photograph of the other woman and said that if he was visiting Rajkot, the woman named Hetal alias Nandani would be available for him. 
 
 “Later, Manish contacted Hetal through SMS and fixed up a meeting in Rajkot on September 14. Hetal met him to her home near Cosmoplex on Kalavad Road. While Manish sat in the room, another woman — in her late 20’s — came out of the bathroom and started talking to him. Suddenly, two persons barged into the room and accused Manish of molesting the woman. When Manish protested, two other men arrived in the room, identifying themselves as cops. They beat him up and threatened to take him to police station. Later, Hetal arrived in the room and told the men that Manish was her relative and requested them to settle the matter then and there,” University police official said.
 
 The four men kidnapped Manish in their SUV and robbed him of Rs 3,500. They asked Manish to cough up another Rs 15 lakh to wriggle out of the situation, police added.
 
 Manish called up his brother-in-law, who said he could give him the money in cheque which the accused refused. Manish asked his other relatives for money, but to no avail. Then the accused scaled down the amount and told Manish to fetch Rs 7 lakh from Morbi. 
 
 Threatened and afraid, Manish went to Bhuj instead of home and later confided his ordeal to his family members, who approached the police.
