BENGALURU: Musical notes, a cheering crowd and rainbow colours greeted visitors to   on Sunday morning. Those looking for a long walk and fresh air were in for a surprise as the  , a popular part of the park, transformed into a space for art, music and poetry between 10am and 1pm.

 Band Stand, once a hub for bands and musicians from across the city, reclaimed its status as singers aged 16 to 70 years old, rendered old classics, evoking nostalgia among all present. The event was organized by Art Mantram and Under the Raintree.
 
 Professional artists and aspiring painters brought to life their ideas celebrating life while children were seen experimenting with colours and patterns spontaneously. From themes of nature to abstract art to self-portraits, each of the artists brought something new to the table. Interestingly, while all the featured artists as well as most of the singers were women, all the activities were also open to men.
 
 Sandhya Mendonca, founder of Under the Raintree, said the main idea of the event was to create a sense of community and to ensure that women don’t have to feel unsafe in any public space.
 
 “Lots of people sent in their entries for our poetry and open mic competitions. Since art is always viewed as being the domain of the elite, we wanted to disassociate from the cliquey tag and open it to everyone. We had held something similar event last year but not to this scale. It was in the aftermath of the incidents on New Year’s Eve where many people thought it right to point fingers at the victims,” she said.
 
 Indira Srinivasan, a professional singer for the last 55 years, who regaled the crowd with classics from the 70s and 80s, said it was exciting to be part of such a lively scene.
 
 Anand Krishna, a visitor, said, “I’ve lived in the city my entire life and yet haven’t been to Cubbon Park as much as I’d like. With events like these, people have something to look forward to. There is a great energy here,” said.
