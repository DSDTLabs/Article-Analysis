NEW DELHI: The   Federation of India (BFI) announced the 13-member contingent for the   in Gold Coast in April and India’s hope in 69 kg men’s category Manoj Kumar feels that team is good enough to deliver its ‘best ever’ performance. 

 
 
 Writing in his column for TOI, Manoj said, “Indian boxing team selected for next month’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast looks matured enough to deliver ‘best ever’ performance, which I think is because of the international exposure trips and slight tweak in the training methods.”
 
 
 
 
 
 The team includes seasoned pugilists like MC Mary Kom, Manoj and Laisharam Devi (60-kg), along with young guns Naman Talwar (91-kg) and the unheralded Gaurav Solanki (52-kg). 
 
 “The team looks balanced with a mixture of young and experienced all ready to give their best,” said wrote Manoj, adding, “The camaraderie between all is something to be noted and that has helped improve confidence of coaches.
 
 “Youngsters like Amit Phangal and Hussam Mohammed are the rising stars, while   and Satish Kumar have international experience while I have been to two Olympic Games. While the other boxers would be making their   debut, I would like to repeat my 2010 gold performance and going by the preparations it looks possible,” he added. 
 
 The 31-year-old boxer picked Vikas Krishan (75kg) and Amit Phangal (46-49kg) as the top medal prospects for India. 
 
 “I wouldn’t be surprised if our team returns with best CWG performance. During the recent training and competition tour to Bulgaria, Vikas and Amit showed they are fully ready by winning gold medals. As for me, I was little unwell and could not Mwelase of South Africa emerged and went on to win gold. Before the Games we had never heard of Mwelase and this is something that every member should remember,” said Manoj.
