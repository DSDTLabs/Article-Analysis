Expectations are high on Harikumar's upcoming movie Clint, which will be a biopic of the child prodigy Edmund Thomas Clint, who died at a young age. 

 The latest we hear is that actors Joy Mathew and Vinay Forrt will also be part of the cast, in significant roles. Says Vinay Forrt, 'I have a major role in the movie that of Clint's mentor. He is an artist himself, and he is the one most attached to Clint. Clint listens only to him and he thus influences the young boy's life a lot.' Like the rest of the characters in the film, his character too was a real-life person, adds Vinay. Interestingly, Vinay remembers visiting an exhibition of Clint's works post his demise. 'I remember going to the exhibition as a child, with my mother. And now I'm acting in a film on Clint.'
 
  Meanwhile, actor Joy Mathew is also part of the cast, and he plays a doctor in the film. 'The doctor is the one who diagnoses Clint's disease and is with him till the end.' The director had discussed the project with him a year ago, and he felt a liking for it immediately, says Joy Mathew. 'Clint's works are not like the ones we are used to seeing; with simple strokes he could create works with deep meaning. It is also a film with immense possibilities for photography. Madhu Ambat, famed for his painting-like frames, is doing the camera,' says Joy.
