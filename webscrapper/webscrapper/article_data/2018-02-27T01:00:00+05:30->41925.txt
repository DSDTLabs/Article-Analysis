 Saqib sat on the stage to speak to the students. "The last time I was on this stage was when I was in my first year. Tab na Mr and Miss DT (currently known as  ) hota tha, abhi bhi hota hai?" and the crowd replied, ‘Yes!’ He added, "And today I have come to promote my movie here. Whatever I am today is because of this institution. It is always great to come back to your own college. There is no better institute than Hindu College."
 "Agar mere gharwale allow karte na toh main har saal fail hota aur issi college mein rehta. Mujhe iss college se bahut pyaar hai. Par mujhe bola gaya hai ki attendance is very important, seriously sab class attend karenge? Ok?," he winked at the crowd.

 Since the title of his upcoming movie is Dil Juunglee, Saqib asked everyone in the audience to do a junglee step. He said, "Jo bhi junglee jaisa dance karega, main uske pass personally aaunga aur dance karunga. After the junglee dance, the actor also managed to win a push-up challenge with the current batch of students. He managed to do around 60 push-ups. “Bade tagde bache hain," he said. Before the event got over, he thanked everyone. "I would like to thank the college for having me here, it is such a nice feeling to come back to your college and get so much love from you all. I will keep coming back to the  , not only to promote my movie but to meet you all," he added.
