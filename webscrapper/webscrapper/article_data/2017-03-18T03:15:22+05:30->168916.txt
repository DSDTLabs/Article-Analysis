NEW DELHI: Academic Madhu Kishwar on Friday approached the   challenging the   brought in after the  , terming them “draconian” and unconstitutional.

 Along with Kishwar, there are two other petitioners in the PIL, which was heard by a bench comprising Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice V K Rao that issued a notice to the Centre, directing it to file an affidavit by July 5 One is a woman convicted and serving a prison sentence in Tihar Jail for allowing   of another woman and the other petitioner is a man being tried for rape under the tightened laws relating to sections 375 and 376 of IPC.
 
 Senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Shivanshu Singh appeared for the petitioners and argued that the amendments, “ostensibly enacted for women’s protection”, are being widely abused and have even failed to reduce crimes against them. The PIL also cites statistics compiled by   that found fake over 50% of rape cases filed in Delhi between April 2013 and July 2014.
 
 “It is a common feature of many laws, enacted ostensibly for women’s protection and the strengthening of women’s rights, that in practice they tend to negate the presumption of innocence, a founding principle of Indian criminal jurisprudence and arm the police with enormous powers of arrest and harassment, thus jeopardising life and liberty,” the petition stated.
 
 It challenged the 2013 amendments for their failure to provide a gradation of offences and punishments, pointing out that a wide variety of acts have now been included in the definition of ‘rape’, and prescribed minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment which violates Articles 14 and 21 as well as the principle of proportionality.
 
 “The inherent danger of the legislative approach taken by the 2013 Act, and the vast scope for abuse, maybe illustrated by considering Section 375(c) that says a man commits rape if he ‘manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into….any part of the woman’s body, or makes her do so with him or any other person, by this definition, the sole testimony of a woman that a man forced her to put her finger into her own ear would be sufficient to constitute rape,” it argued, urging the HC to strike down some of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, which provides the amendments of IPC, Indian Evidence Act and Code of Criminal Procedure on laws related to sexual offences.
