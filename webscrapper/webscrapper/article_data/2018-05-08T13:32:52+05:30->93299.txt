PATNA: The state government has directed all district magistrates and civil surgeons to shut down   lounges in the state.

 A letter issued by the   on May 5 states that strict action will be taken against those people found in contempt of some specific sections of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003. These include section 4 (prohibition of smoking in a public place), section 5 (prohibition of advertisement of cigarettes and other tobacco products), section 6 (a) (prohibition on sale of cigarettes or other tobacco products to a person below the age of 18 years) and section 7 (restrictions on supply and distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products without proper warning).
 
 The letter also noted that young men and women visit such lounges and often lure minors.
 
 “Tobacco used in closed confines of such places not only pollutes air, but is harmful for health... People who breathe in the air may acquire various diseases,” it read and also mentioned the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 that lays down stringent punishment for those selling tobacco products or cigarettes to minors. The offender faces a jail term of seven years and a fine of Rs 1 lakh.
 
 According to the owner of a pan shop that sells   products near Dak Bungalow roundabout, “Earlier,   had four hookah bars which were shut down over time. Now, the use of hookah is more common in houses,” he said.
 
 The owner of a now-closed hookah lounge in the city told this reporter, “Nearly 25% of our customers in the age group of 25-40 years ordered our tobacco-free hookah. After we stopped selling hookah, we suffered huge losses.”
 
 Dr Rajnish Choudhary, nodal officer for tobacco control, said the government is trying to curb the use of tobacco in public places.
