While it’s common to see actors being unable to shake off an intense character, in Arun Mandola’s case, the character seems to be chasing him. After playing Lakshman in the show ' ', he has now been roped in to reprise the role in   — one of India’s oldest Ramlilas, which is organised every year at Red Fort (Delhi), around Dussehra. 

 A Delhi boy, Arun himself has childhood memories associated with the Lav Kush Ramlila. He says, “I remember how people used to talk about Lal Qile ki Ramlila and today, I am really happy to be a part of it. This is my first experience on stage, but I am not nervous because I have been waiting for this opportunity. When your dreams come true, you can’t help giving your best.”
 
 There’s another reason too, for the actor’s excitement. “Honestly, I wasn’t happy with my performance in 'Mahabali Hanumaan' because I did not get time to prep for the role. I was a fresher, who bagged a big role overnight. I want to compensate for it on stage now,” he signs off.
