CHENNAI: The Madras   on March 5 will decide whether or not self-styled godman Nithyananda shall be allowed to enter the  . Concluding the final hearing on the plea moved by M Jagathalapradhapan of Madurai seeking a direction to the government to take suitable and appropriate action against Nithyananda and protect the Madurai mutt, Justice   said he would pass orders on Monday.

 Earlier during the hearing, the judge pulled up the Madurai Adheenam for inviting Nithyananda which has caused all these troubles. “I would pass strong observations against the adheenam also in the order,” the judge said. “By involving such people in the affairs of the adheenam, you are causing damage to tradition of this land,” he added. In December 2017, the court passed interim orders restraining Nithyananda and his disciples from entering the adheenam until further orders.
