 The tank was in a dilapidated condition and it could not be dismantled manually, said managing director of Maglink Infra Projects, P Ponlingam. “The Coir Board had invited tenders for the work and we approached them,” he said, adding that it was the first time the technology was used in the state. “It took 15 days for doing the preparation work,” said  , but refused to divulge the details of the explosives used for the demolition. “We set up a control room 80 feet away from the building and the explosives were set off using a control button. We have alerted the local people in advance before the explosion,” he added.
 Anithadas Raveendranath, director Coir Board, Alappuzha, said that they had initiated the steps for demolishing the water tank two years ago. “But we could not do it as there were no response after we invited tenders two times. This time Maglink Infra Projects came forward and we assigned the job to them,” she said. The Coir Board has spent Rs 10 lakh for this purpose and the structure was demolished completely within three seconds. The tank was 80 feet tall.
