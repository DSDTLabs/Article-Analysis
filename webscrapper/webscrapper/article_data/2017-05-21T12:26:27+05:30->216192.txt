KOLKATA: India returned with one gold from the World Cup Stage I event in Shanghai, China, when the men's compound team defeated Colombia 226-221 on Saturday morning. The fourth-seeded Indian side of  ,   and debutant   proved far too superior against 10th-seeded Colombia's Camilo Cardona, Daniel Munoz and Jose Carlos Ospina in a one-sided final.

 However, apart from the trio, the man who should also be credited for this success is their coach  . In a way, it was also a great comeback for him too who was banned by the   (AAI) for one year after the Indian team failed to turn up for their bronze medal play-off match against Italy at the World University Games at Gwangju in South Korea, thereby forfeiting the match in July 2015.
 
 Jiwanjot, a coach of that side, was at the centre of the controversy as   (AIU), taking a serious view of the incident, had banned the archers and their coach for three years. The AAI too followed suit and barred foreign coach   and Jiwanjot for one year from accompanying the team to international events after conducting an internal inquiry into the matter.
 
 This was only Jiwanjot's second international tour after serving the ban period. The Punjab University head coach played his role well in developing a good team combination as the trio had never shoot together in any international meet before.
 
 "Right now, our team is made up of three men with different experience but our training is showing we're doing well. We are all the same; we all talk, make decisions together no matter how long we've been shooting for or what we've achieved," Verma later said about the win.
