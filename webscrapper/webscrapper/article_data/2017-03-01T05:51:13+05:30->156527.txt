Mumbai: Merely driving a vehicle at a high speed is not enough to attract the offence of  , the HC has held.   dismissed the state government's application to overturn the acquittal of a Ratnagiri resident accused of running his vehicle over the legs of a woman resulting in amputation of her left leg. 

 “Criminal rashness is a dangerous act with the knowledge that it is so and that it may cause injury, but without intention to cause injury or knowledge that it will be probably caused. The fact that the accused was merely driving at a high speed cannot attract   (rash and negligent driving),” said Justice Naik. “The fact that a vehicle is driven in speed or that a vehicle is not driven in speed, cannot by itself without judging the situation in which the driver had been placed, be a factor to determine the rashness or negligence. High speed may not, in each case, be sufficient to hold that the driver is rash or negligent. In fact, in the present case, it is not established that the driver was, in such a high speed, driving in reckless manner or that he was rash or negligen,” said the judge. The court said that the prosecution had miserably failed to prove the charges. 
 
 The accident for which the acquitted man, Suresh Mule, had been booked took place near Mahakali temple in 1995.
