 BMC said that while the response was good from parents in terms of applications, it did not translate into admissions.“The rush is for select schools.Parents are not willing to take admissions in schools where seats are still available. Due to this mismatch in demand and supply , a lot of students are left without a seat,“ said an official from the education department. There were 764 seats across 39 schools which received no applications.
 
 However, parents and activists blamed schools for the poor admissions. “Schools don't want to admit students so they find ways to delay the process and then parents miss out on the deadline. Some schools deny admission on basis of distance and documentation and we do not receive help from civic officials when we complain,“ said K Narayan of Anudanit Shiksha Bachao Samiti, an NGO which helps parents with the admission process.
 
 The state had asked the local bodies to complete admissions by April 30. “Even if seats are vacant, we can't conduct more rounds due to the deadline,“ said the official. Until last year, admissions went on up till January , almost eight months into the academic year.
