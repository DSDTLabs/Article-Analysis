CHANDIGARH: The   on Tuesday asked   to respond to the application filed by Magsaysay awardee and whistle-blower   (IFS) officer  , accusing the state government of perjury and concealment of documents before the high court.

 Justice P B Bajanthri of the HC asked the Haryana government to file a reply by February 28. Chaturvedi had filed the application in relation to the ongoing petition filed by Haryana government, contending that the Union ministry of environment and forest had illegally constituted a committee that had given clean chit to Chaturvedi and indicted state government officials. It had been further contended by Haryana that the committee had submitted a report casting aspersions against its officials without giving them any opportunity of hearing. The state has been contending that the orders of Central government were unconstitutional and violated the principles of natural justice.
 
 In his application, Chaturvedi has alleged that the state’s petition is based on false statements and concealment of documents vital to the case. The foundation of the entire petition was “so-called violation of principle of natural justice”, with the petitioners repeatedly claiming that they were not given an opportunity to put their version before the Central government.
 
 “The inquiry committee had sent five letters to the petitioner state for submitting information, documents and records it deemed fit. Finally, the state government submitted its reply and its response was examined in detail. Thus the entire foundation of the writ petition is based on the offence of perjury, for which exemplary punishment needs to be inflicted. The offence becomes graver in view of the fact that the same have been committed by the state, which is supposed to be upholder and custodian of the rule of law,” Chaturvedi has argued.
