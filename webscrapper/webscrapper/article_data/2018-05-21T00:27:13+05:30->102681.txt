WASHINGTON The US   with China is "on hold" after the world's largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, US treasury secretary   said on Sunday. Mnuchin and US President  's top economic adviser, Larry  , said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future. 

  "We are putting the trade war on hold. Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework," Mnuchin said in a television interview on "Fox News Sunday". 
 
 On Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to close the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China. 
 
 During an initial round of talks this month in Beijing, Washington demanded that China reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countries' joint statement on Saturday. 
 
  The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return a request for comment. Kudlow said it was too soon to lock in the $200 billion figure. "Details will be down the road. These things are not so precise." 
 
  Beijing agreed to take measures to substantially reduce the US trade deficit with China and offered to make structural reforms, such as lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers, that will allow the US to export goods worth billions of dollars more, Kudlow said earlier in the day. Trump was in a "very positive mood about this," Kudlow said. However, he said there was no trade deal reached so far . Reuters
