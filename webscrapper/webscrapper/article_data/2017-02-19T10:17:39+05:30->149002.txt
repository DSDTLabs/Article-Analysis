 has come out strongly against those who attacked the actress on Saturday night, terming it a matter of shame. "What matters is that a woman was attacked, not whether she is an actress or not," she said. Bhagyalakshmi also adds that she has tried to contact the actress but her phone was switched off. It is common for actresses to travel at all times of the night for shoots, and it's shameful a Malayali actress had to face it, she adds.
