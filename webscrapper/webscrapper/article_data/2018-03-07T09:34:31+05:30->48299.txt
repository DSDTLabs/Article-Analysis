THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The assembly witnessed curious political overtures on Tuesday when Kerala Congress (M) chairman   directed the house’s attention to the alleged failure of the state forest department in protecting the state’s interest in   case. The ownership of the forest area was challenged by private parties in high court.

 
 Though KC(M) leaders had raised allegations of financial irregulairities against CPI leadership and   for the setback in the case, Mani chose not to repeat the same. He tried to blame the department in general after the state lost its upper hand, which it had been maintaining (in the litigation) since 1981.
 
 After speaker   read out the notice given by Mani seeking an adjournment motion, CPI members questioned the rationale behind the move. But, there was no unrest among CPM leaders. The speaker told CPI members that the chair had decided to give permission as Mani had the support of 15 members for the adjournment motion. Raju said the high court, though it permitted the complainants to approach land tribunal to establish their ownership over a part of the reserve forest, has equivocally clarified that land earmarked as forest in government record would remain as forest land.
 
 Mani said the government advocate not only failed to present the favourable orders which the government had received in the past, but also told the court that the area facing ownership dispute was not forest, but thicket.   said it was doubtful whether filing a revision petition against the HC order was possible as the case was earlier remanded by Supreme Court to the HC. Other UDF constituents, who raised their voice to support Mani, walked out of the assembly after the speaker refused permission to discuss the motion in detail.
