AHMEDABAD: Dr  ,  ,  , was hosted by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) on Thursday. Dr Rama spoke about light and the correlation between the night lights and   of various geographical areas within South Asia.

 “The luminosity observed from satellites acted as a good proxy for estimating the economic activity and the night light intensity yielded some interesting results as well. For instance, the research showed that parts of India like Rajasthan and Gujarat indicated high level of per capita income when compared to the eastern states like Odisha and West Bengal, among others.” Rama said, “Similar was the case for Leh region of Jammu and Kashmir which showed high per capita income rates. These findings questioned the perceptions of ‘Lull cities trapped in circumstances unfavourable for businesses.”
 
 Dr Rama also studied the state and district-wise GDP numbers. One of the limitations of the study as highlighted by Dr Rama was that changes in weather patterns or seasonality might have affected the data to an extent. “Most of the data such as estimated GDP figures were in sync with the measured GDP numbers, barring a few exceptions,” he said, adding that it was one of the many ways to gather data and use it to project GDP with minimal fluctuations.
