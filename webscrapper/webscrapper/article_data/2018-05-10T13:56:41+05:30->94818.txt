MARGAO: Shadow Council for   (SCM) on Wednesday sought a thorough investigation by   officials into the ‘fake birth certificate scam’ that the SCM had unearthed within the   (MMC). The SCM further demanded that the municipality immediately cancel the fake registrations from their records and initiate strict action against the culprits involved in this racket. 

 SCM convenor   along with other members Radha Kavlekar, John Gonsalves, Irenau Fernandes, Agostinho Fernandes and   informed the media that there is evidence to suggest that there probably could be more than 100 such cases of fake birth certificates registered by the MMC due to late registrations. 
 
 They pointed out that the fraud committed by MMC officials has raised numerous doubts as no proper verification was conducted, while a suspended official has been reinstated into service.
