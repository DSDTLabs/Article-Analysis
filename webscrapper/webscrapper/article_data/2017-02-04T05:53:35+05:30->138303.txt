HYDERABAD: LPG supply in the city has been hit over the past week. A maintenance problem in a Chennai pipeline has adversely impacted supplies to   (GAIL) pipeline in Visakhapatnam. As result, bottling units in Cherlapally, which supplies LPG to city, have not been able to meet demands. Suppliers say the issues will continue for a few more days.

 “The problem began a few days ago, and we are told that some problem in Chennai pipeline has impacted supplies to Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad,“ Ashok Kumar, City Gas Dealers Association president said.
 
 According to oil companies, the city needs around 2,000 tonnes of LPG every day. With supplies running short, only 1,000 tonnes are being received.There is at least a four to five day backlog when it comes to cylinder supply .
 
 Customers, for their part, are upset that gas supply has been hit. “This problem happened in December last year and during Diwali last year for 10 days. Now again, we are short of supplies,“  , a resident of Dilsukhnagar, said.Many demand that such gaps in supply be intimated in advance.
 
 “Some people may be out of town and they may need a refill, and suddenly they come to know of a supply problem,“ said Chandrakala, a resident of Gandhi Nagar. While the city is grappling with shortage of cooking gas, sales of LPG used for autos jumped by almost 24.8% in Telangana in the three months between October and December 2016, following a reduction in prices of the clean fuel. According to  , director general of the   (IAC), leading oil companies since October 2016, reduced the auto LPG price to make it cost 50%lesser than petrol. This has led to a jump nationally in sales.
