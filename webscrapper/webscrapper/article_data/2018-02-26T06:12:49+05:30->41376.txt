ALLAHABAD:   Secondary Education Board (UP Board) has summoned the experts who framed the controversial question in English paper of class 12 exams, asking students to write a letter complaining about the "lax attitude of primary school teachers." 

 Primary teachers across the state had threatened to sue the Board over the question, following which the board secretary has ordered the moderator and paper setters to explain the reason for choosing the question.
 
 The question paper was meant for students who have opted for commerce and humanities streams. Images of the paper held in the second session of February 21 went viral after primary teachers objected to a question which read: "Write a letter to the district magistrate of your district drawing his attention towards the laxity of the primary school teachers in performing their duties."
