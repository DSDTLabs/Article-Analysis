NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old   was arrested for duping   of Rs 22 lakh in the last six months through a technique that he had mastered while auditing ATMs during his job with two cash management companies.

 The accused, Dinesh Kumar Lal, had made 232 withdrawals in the past six months from an   in   as he knew that the machine was faulty. Lal had opened over 10 accounts in various banks in his and his relatives’ names to commit the fraud. 
 
 Lal would wait till some time to pick up the money from the cash dispenser. While taking the cash, he would block the sensor of the ATM either by a card or currency note. “As the ATM was faulty, it would start a transaction reversal process due to blockage of the sensor. The transaction would then be mentioned as unsuccessful in the logbook,” said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.
 
 The accused would then lodge complaints with banks alleging non-receipt of money after which the amounts mentioned by him would be credited to his account.
 
 A probe was started following a complaint from the bank in Rajouri Garden. “The bank said that on tallying the cash manually, the amount remaining in the ATM was found less than what was shown in the statements of the machine. 
 
 A team led by assistant commissioner HSP Singh crutinised the bank accounts in which the cash reversals had been done and traced the accused. He was arrested on Sunday evening,” Kumar said.
