KOLKATA: A day after lodging a complaint against an auto driver and getting him arrested on  , the 26-year-old interior designer speaks to TOI about how she refused to stay mum after being humiliated by a stranger and vowed to take a legal action against the man. Here’s what the woman says:

 
 I’ve heard from some friends how they get humiliated by strangers on the road every other day but don’t react, except tell their near ones about it and at the most, take to   for protest. They never dare to take the legal way out.
 
 When I was assaulted by an auto driver on Monday, I promptly walked into the police station with a photograph of of the man, which I took on my cellphone, and filed a complaint. The cops called me late in the night to inform that they nabbed him. I consider it a moral victory, not only for me but for all women who suffer such harassment in public every day.
 
 
  
 
 On Monday, I took an auto of route Golpark — Garia opposite   police station around 2.30pm. I sat in the backseat. When we reached Jadavpur 8B, I asked the driver how much was the fare till Baghajatin and he said it was Rs 7. I handed him a 10-rupee note and he returned the change. But when I got down at Baghajatin and was about to leave, he caught my wrist alleging I didn’t pay. I protested but he didn’t let go. I felt humiliated and was ready to pay the fare again but he continued rubbing his palm on my wrist. At this point, I raised an alarm and people began gathering. The driver told them I was trying to flee without paying. When I took out my cellphone and took a snap, he sped away hurling abuses at me.
 
 First, I went to the site where Ihad work. On my way back, I asked a cop which police station did the area fall under and subsequently lodged a complaint at Jadavpur police station.
