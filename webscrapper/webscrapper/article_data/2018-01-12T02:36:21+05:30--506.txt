NEW DELHI: The vigilance wing cracked down heavily on complaints of misconduct and graft in 2017. A total of 59 policemen were dismissed from service and another 585 were placed under suspension for corruption.

 Delhi Police initiated 6,665 departmental inquiries out of which the charges were found true against 928  . During the year, 299 policemen — including five inspectors, 22 sub-inspectors, 11 assistant sub-inspectors, 44 head constables and 156 constables — were awarded major punishments.
 
 A total of 1,782 cops — 188 inspectors, 612 SIs, 347 ASIs, 329 HCs and 306 constables — were awarded minor punishments for censure.
 
 The departmental action cell coordinated all punishment-related work for Delhi Police with emphasis on timely completion of disciplinary proceedings and punishment to defaulters.
 
 “Police aberrations that have a direct bearing on the image of Delhi Police were identified and strict administrative action, including dismissal in blatant instances, was taken in each act of misdemeanour, impropriety or corruption,” said police commissioner  .
 
 In 2017, 367 independent vigilance inquiries were conducted in complaints of a relatively serious nature. Of these, allegations in 65 inquiries were proven against 158 policemen — including a DCP, 46 inspectors, 43 SIs, 27 ASIs, 20 SHOs and 21 constables — and disciplinary action taken.
 
 “Delhi Police placed primary emphasis on redressing public grievances and the vigilance branch acted as the nodal agency to monitor references and complaints received from various quarters and facilitated their expeditious disposal,” said special commissioner  .
 
 During the year, 60,659 complaints were received on complaints monitoring and tracking system (CMTS). Special attention was paid to certain categories of complaints, such as corruption, extortion, connivance in land and property matters and organised unlawful activity, dereliction of duty, etc, which have a direct bearing on the image of police.
 
 Data shows that 711 policemen were added to the doubtful integrity list, while names of 492 cops were removed. The vigilance branch maintains the review list of cops with doubtful integrity on the recommendations of districts and units.
 
 The anti-corruption helpline gave an added advantage of receiving audio and video recordings to be used as evidence in support of a complaint. The number of such calls increased marginally from 116 in 2016 to 136 in 2017.
