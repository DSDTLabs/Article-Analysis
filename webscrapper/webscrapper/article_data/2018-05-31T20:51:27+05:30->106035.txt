Mindless action scenes, love at first sight (quite literally), a dozen comedians who fail to evoke laughter, an evil politician and an aloof, goofy young man who suddenly turns into a saviour. Sounds familiar? 

  Ravi Teja’s latest venture 
  is as predictable as they come. Loud and boorish, this   directorial lacks imagination and creativity. 
 
  The film begins with the swearing-in of the new Home Minister ( ) who not only conspires to assassinate his father, also a politician, but also indulges in corrupt activities and creates fear among the people. 
 
  In comes  , an orphan who loves having people around him. He goes out of his way to help others and ensure people look after their parents. Inevitably, he becomes the saviour for the people against the powerful and oppressive home minister. But will he succeed?
 
  The first half of this film disappoints, simply because of its predictability and lack of imagination. One can sleep through parts of it and still predict what happens next. 
 
  At the intermission, a tagline ‘Mission starts now’ splashes on the screen. But to salvage this movie, they have a mountain to climb.
