 Panaji: The India U-17 World Cup squad will play five friendlies in four weeks during the first leg of their European preparatory tour later this month in  .
  
  Portuguese coach   has opted to take the boys to a “fantastic training centre” on the outskirts of Lisbon and will test his players against top teams from Portugal, many of who will have players from the national team.
  
  “We have confirmation (of friendlies) from  , Sporting (Lisbon), Setubal and Belenenses. The AIFF is in touch for other friendlies as we will also play a few games in France and later participate in a tournament in Italy. These games will be tough,” Matos told TOI on Thursday.
  
  The coach will allow the players to get acclimatized to the conditions in Portugal during the first week, besides also conducting extensive medical tests. Once that is done, the friendlies will kick in and Matos expects the boys to measure up to the challenge.
  
  “The players must now graduate to the next level. It’s one thing to excel here in Goa where the conditions are ideal but in Europe, it will be a different ball game. When you go abroad, it’s all about your personality on the field,” he said.
