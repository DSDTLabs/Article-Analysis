It is a film that has been in the news for a long time and has many eagerly awaiting it. And here’s the good news — Rocking Star Yash’s next,  , is now in   stage, with the team in dubbing mode. After canning a sequence featuring veteran actor   earlier this month, the film was edited, leaving only one song to be shot and added later. 
The team is aiming to release KGF in the second half of the year, which explains the haste with which post-production is on. Shooting for the second in the two-part film will begin thereafter. 
 Directed by Prashanth Neel, the Yash-Srinidhi Shetty starrer is a period drama set in the 70s, and the team has been fiercely secretive about the story and the set. 
 The film has an ensemble cast that includes first-timers and other known faces.
