LUCKNOW: UP minister and trusted   aide   played the peacemaker on Saturday when he persuaded father and son,  , to bury the hatchet. Moments later, the SP patriarch revoked the expulsion of his son Akhilesh and cousin Ram Gopal.

 Azam said the truce followed a highly “emotional” discussion between father and son during which he was present. “When a son gets upset with his father, it’s always the latter who has to cheer him up, irrespective of who is at fault,” Azam said.
 
 He added that the main point of discord between Mulayam and Akhilesh was his and Ram Gopal’s expulsion from the party. “Netaji agreed to revoke their suspension immediately,” Azam said. He said issues like accommodating Akhilesh’s choices in the party’s official candidate list for the 2017 polls were minor issues and would be resolved soon.” Earlier in the day, Azam had held two meetings with Mulayam lasting over 90 minutes each, after which he drove to Akhilesh’s residence. Barely 15 minutes later, the two went to meet Mulayam. Sources said Azam made an emotional appeal before Akhilesh to do his bit to stop the party from splitting. About an hour later Mulayam called for his younger brother and SP state president  , who announced that the expulsion orders had been revoked.
 
 Azam said Mulayam was no longer averse to the idea of Akhilesh calling the special convention of the party but added: “The convention will be held as people have already been invited.” He said, however, that it would be of a different nature now.
 
 It was Ram Gopal’s move to call an emergency convention that had irked Mulayam to the extent that he expelled him and Akhilesh from the party
