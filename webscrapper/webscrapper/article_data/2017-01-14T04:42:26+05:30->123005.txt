BENGALURU:   disappointed again. Third quarter dollar revenue declined sequentially by 0.3% in constant currency terms, significantly worse that TCS’s 2% growth, indicating that chief executive Vishal Sikka’s drive to move the company towards greater innovation and automation isn’t yet producing the desired results.

 The company also revised its full year revenue guidance for the third consecutive time this fiscal, expecting now to grow between 8.4-8.8% in constant currency terms, compared to 8-9% it estimated in October. Constant currency discounts the effect of currency fluctuations over which companies have no control.
 
 Chief financial officer M D  , however, said at a press conference on Friday that it cannot be seen as a reduction in guidance. “Three months back, we assumed a negative growth rate of 0.6% as the third quarter was expected to be worse. But now that we have done relatively better, the lower end of the guidance moves up.”
 
 He said in the last quarter, given the greater visibility into final revenue, the guidance range cannot be too wide. Hence the band has been shrunk.
 
 Nonetheless, the markets saw nothing particularly positive in Infosys’ results, and the share price fell 2.7% on Friday.
 
 The new guidance range means that Infosys, India’s second biggest software services company by revenue, will end the fiscal with estimated revenue of $10.3 billion, instead of about $10.8 billion it projected in April. And it makes Sikka’s 2021 target of hitting $20 billion in revenue, operating margins of 30% and $80,000 revenue per employee all the more difficult. The last metric stood at $51,900 for the quarter.
 
 Infosys has struggled in recent quarters, after almost two years of good growth after Sikka took over in August 2014.
 
 But for the year as a whole, its growth is likely to come out ahead of peers.
