LUCKNOW: A day before the much anticipated, high-stake byelections in   and Phulpur, the   party announced support for BSP   candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar. UP will send 10 members to the upper House of Parliament for which elections are scheduled to be held on March 23. 

 Leader of Congress legislative committee Ajay Kumar Lallu said that the decision had been taken jointly by all Congress MLAs. 
 
 "There are seven Congress MLAs and we will all support the   candidate. The way the law and order situation is deteriorating in the country and the BJP is forcefully occupying constitutional posts and trying to impose the Sangh ideology on everyone, we have decided to support the party which can defeat BJP. We held a meeting on Saturday and took a joint decision to support BSP. The decision was also vetted by the central leadership and conveyed by senior party member Ghulam Nabi Azad," said Lallu.
 
 The decision by Congress comes days after BSP chief Mayawati said that Congress should support BSP's candidate if it expected BSP to support its candidate for Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh. BSP also declared support for SP in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur byelections, saying it would help any candidate who could make BJP lose. 
 
 Mayawati was reportedly miffed with the Congress for having accepted expelled BSP member   in its fold, which is also one of the reasons why she may have chosen to back SP.
 
 Of the 10 Rajya Sabha seats up for grabs, BJP and its allies can send members to eight due to their strength in the House. SP, which has 47 members, can safely elect one and will have 10 votes to spare since each candidate is required to get a minimum of 37 votes.
