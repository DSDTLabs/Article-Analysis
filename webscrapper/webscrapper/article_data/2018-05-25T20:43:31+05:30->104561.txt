HYDERABAD: The City of Pearls recently received the Swachh Survekshan award for being India’s best capital city for solid waste management, but the reality is out for all to see. Hyderabad generates 4,500 metric tonnes of garbage every day, and much of it is just lying around on the streets, accumulating under flyovers and choking nalas.

 
  
  
 
 Even as the award was welcomed with pride, city residents say heaps of garbage are a common sight across the city, from Secunderabad to Shamshabad, First Lancer area in Banjara Hills and   in  . Apart from the foul smell, residents are constantly plagued by pollution and the threat of infections.
 
 Over time, garbage has also taken over open spaces, with a playground in Trimulgherry turning into a dumpyard. “Kids used to learn karate here. But now it’s filled with garbage,” said  , a resident of Secunderabad.
 
 Litter dumps are a prominent sight in First Lancer and residents rue that even though sanitation workers from the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ) clear garbage bins regularly, nothing is done about the waste that has accumulated over time in street corners and open spaces. “Garbage lying around dustbins is not just an eyesore, but also spreads infections,” says Abdul Mukhtar, a tailor.
 
 Garbage burning is also rampant in areas such as Hydershahkote and Sun City. “It’s like getting killed by own own toxicity. Garbage is usually thrown in plastic bags, which doesn’t allow it to decompose and chokes animals,” says Medha N, an environmentalist.
 
 Authorities, however, claim to be doing their part. Dr Qadri, chief medical officer of health, GHMC, says, “We send trucks and autos regularly to collect garbage. We have also employed 2,654 units of cleaners, with seven members in each unit. Blue and green segregation dustbins have also been distributed. All the garbage is sent to  . If we see anyone littering, we penalise them ₹500-1,000 depending on the litter.”
