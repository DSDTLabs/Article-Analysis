DOMKAL (MURSHIDABAD): It’s a do-or-die situation for the ruling Trinamool in the  . 

 With as many as six civic bodies in Murshidabad in its fold that the party had snatched from Congress through smart party swaps, this is the first municipal poll where Trinamool will be facing the people.
 
 Trinamool leaders can’t afford to lose Domkal because it would call into question the manner in which the party managed a majority in other municipalities without people’s mandate. Senior party leaders — Suvendu Adhikari, Mukul Roy, Sultan Ahmed, Mahua Moitra and   — are all  . 
 
 The higher the stake, the more is the chance of violence on election day, residents fear. The fact is as many as 12 Congress-turned-Trinamool leaders in the area have arrest warrants against them though police are looking the other way.
 
 The Opposition — Congress, CPM and even BJP — also has a point to prove in Domkal polls. Pushed to the wall in a district that happened to be the last fort of Congress, state unit president Adhir Chowdhury has taken up this fight personally because it is crucial for his party’s survival in the district. It’s also a major challenge for CPM veteran Anisur Rahman that has prompted him to agree to a “non-aggression pact” with Congress against whom CPM fought till the 2016 assembly polls. The truce has resulted in a one-on-one contest with Trinamool in most of the 21 wards with Congress candidates taking up the fight in 10, leaving the rest to CPM. 
 
 Opposition BJP may, however, queer the opposition’s pitch by drawing sections of Hindu votes, a minority in the district, and pave the way for Trinamool. The party has fielded candidates in all 21 wards. Parleys are going on among the opposition to prevent a split in its votes.
 
 A municipality along the Indo-Bangla border, Domkal has always been high on violence. “Unknown faces have started reaching Domkal, raising the spectre of violence,” said tea stall owner Saidul Shiekh.
