MANGALURU: Deputy Commissioner and district magistrate Sasikanth   on Saturday, in an advisory, warned media in general and visual media in particular not to exceed provisions of the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995. 

 The warning comes in the wake of television news channels airing CCTV footage of a near murderous attack on an hotelier in   on the night miscreantsâ€™ targeted Hindu activist   at Katipalla. 
 
 Making public this advisory, T R Suresh, city police chief, also additional district magistrate, said the DC in exercise of powers as authorized officer under section 2(a)(1) and as per section 19 of the Act has advised all TV channels airing in DK district to follow provisions of the programme and advertising code. Noting that this appeal is to help maintain law and order and communal harmony in the district, he said, those failing to do so are liable for prosecution.
 
 Senthil in the advisory stated that a handful of miscreants are trying to disturb communal harmony in the district by indulging in isolated attacks on innocents and by spreading rumours. In the wake of recent incidents with communal overtones, Senthil said some TV channels have been telecasting rumours, hearsay messages, at the first instance without proper verification of facts. They have also been airing footage of violent incidents and that of injured individuals repeatedly.
 
 The DC urged the channels to keep following points in mind while reporting incidents that are communal in nature. These include; telecast of news only after proper verification of facts and channels should exercise restraint while covering violence and rioting,
