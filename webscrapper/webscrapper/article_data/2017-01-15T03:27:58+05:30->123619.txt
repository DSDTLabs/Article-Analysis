KHARAGPUR: On a day the RSS held a Brigade rally much to the Trinamool’s chagrin, the ruling party’s leaders sought to link the sangh and   to the murder of   don  . Kharagpur   chairman Pradip Sarkar alleged on Saturday that Sankar Rao, prime accused in the case, was an RSS man who had undergone training at a sangh camp in Odisha. Even Srinu’s wife Puja alleged that state BJP president and Kharagpur MLA Dilip Ghosh had threatened   while addressing a public rally before the last assembly polls.

 Police, meanwhile, made further progress in the case with the arrest of John Francis, an underworld don in whose house the final meeting to execute the crime was held on January 8. 
 
 Dilip Ghosh, however, denied Rao’s links to the sangh or BJP and threatened to file a defamation case against Trinamool leaders making the allegation. After West Midnapore SP Bharati Ghosh’s statement about involvement of “influential people” in the murder, Ghosh said, “We have no faith in the SP who is more a Trinamool person than a police officer. We have demanded a CBI probe into the murder of Naidu who was like a goose that laid golden eggs for Trinamool.”
 
 Hours after Srinu’s murder, BJP’s town president Prem Chand Jha had said one Sankar Rao had approached him for enrolment as a party member, but his application was rejected. But Jha backtracked within 24 hours of the SP saying that influential people, who feared Srinu’s rise as a strong leader, had plotted the murder. “That Sankar was another person,” Jha said on Saturday. Countering the civic chairman, a BJP leader said, “Sankar enjoyed protection of the Trinamool ever since it came to power.” 
 
 At Friday’s parade of seven arrested accused, Sankar was introduced as the mastermind. The SP said he hired the supari killers from Jamshedpur.
