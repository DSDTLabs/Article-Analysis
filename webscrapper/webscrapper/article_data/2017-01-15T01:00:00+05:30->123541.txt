Sanjay Gupta, who is known for his dark, gritty and intense films that showcase the dark underbelly of Mumbai, chose real locations of the city for his upcoming release, ' '. On the other hand, the large-hearted   ensured that the shoot of this Hrithik Roshan-Yaami Gautam starrer went on smoothly. From the lobby of a Byculla hospital, a popular bungalow along Andheri’s Yari Road, railway stations across Mumbai to an entertainment theme park near the city, everything about the film is as authentic as it can get.

 Pleased with the backing of his producer who ‘has a heart of gold’, Sanjay says, “Besides securing the locations, Rakeshji also put up the entire cast and crew in a   hotel as most of the locations were on this side of the town, so no one gets tired of travelling from one part of the city to another. When we were shooting outdoors in Byculla and Andheri in summer, he had air-conditioned units installed. He rarely visited the sets even though he is an amazing director himself and gave me a free hand at all times. I have never come across a producer who bears so many costs because he is constantly concerned about the people who are working on his movie.”
