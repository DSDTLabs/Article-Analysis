 "It was a small intimate affair which Shraddha's mother   had been planning for a while. She personally decided the menu and ordered a cake well in advance for her daughter, while dad   was in-charge of the cocktails," informs a source close to the family, adding that Shraddha's aunts, Padmini and Tejaswini Kolhapure, uncles   and Pankaj Saraswat and cousins Priyank and Vedika were on the guest list. 
 
 Brother Siddhanth who was in Abu Dhabi over the weekend for the wedding of Delhi-based filmmaker-entrepreneur  's to restaurateur Aashita Relan, flew in early on Wednesday to be a part of the revelry. Shraddha recently wrapped up the first schedule of Apoorva Lakhia's   biopic and was shooting an ad yesterday. "She is really excited about her 10-day break. She will be travelling through a few cities in Europe before returning to the Bay in mid March," adds the source.
