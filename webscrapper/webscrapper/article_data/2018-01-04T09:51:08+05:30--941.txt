Indore: A considerable drop in skyrocketing prices of   has given a reason to the homemakers to rejoice as once hitting a high of Rs 80/kg in last six months, the essential and perishable commodity of every kitchen has fallen to Rs 10/kg in wholesale market in last around two weeks.

 “Bumper production of tomato and arrival of new crop from Maharashtra are the reasons behind its slashed rate. The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and it’s available at Rs 15-20 in retail market,”   secretary   told TOI.
 
 He said that as crop’s supply is expected to reduce, tomato’s rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers’ disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.
 
 “Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in   wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg,” Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.
 
 He said that a few weeks ago, potato’s wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.
 
 “Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate,” Garg said.
 
 Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.
 
 “Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate” Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.
 
 “Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg” Garg said.
