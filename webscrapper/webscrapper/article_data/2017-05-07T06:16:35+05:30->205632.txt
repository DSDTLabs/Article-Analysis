KOCHI: Walking along MG Road has become a risky affair. The ongoing drainage works coupled with illegal parking force pedestrians to leave footpaths and walk along the busy road. 

 "It is difficult to find a proper footpath. At some areas drains are kept open for reconstruction works, and people have to walk through the road. Vehicles move at a high speed through the newly laid road. Pungent smell emits from open drains. Silt from drains is heaped on the road. All these make walking unsafe," said  , a pedestrian.
 
 This parking crisis is a major issue along the   corridor. Many building owners have converted parking spaces in the ground floor into commercial spaces. Small shopowners do not have the resources to provide parking. In the busy commercial areas people slow down their vehicles looking for a space to park. This results in traffic congestion. When no specific areas are earmarked for parking shoppers park their vehicles on the footpath. "The city authorities and police are not taking effective steps to address illegal parking," said T G  , a businessman.
 
 Though there are pay and park facilities not all motorists are keen to opt for it. Shoppers are generally reluctant to park their vehicles away from the shopping centre and walk a short distance. "Customers do not favour shops where there is no parking facility. It affects business," said Anwar Ali, a shopkeeper from Kaloor.
 
 The city police say that parking on the footpath is illegal and can invite fine from Rs 100 to Rs 500 or more depending on the intensity of violation. They said that approximately, 6,000 parking violations are reported in a month, and on any given day the number of cases would vary between 150 and180 cases. "MG Road and   are two main spots of violations, in our area. This could be avoided only if more parking spaces are provided" said CI N R Jayaraj, Cochin Traffic Police, West.
