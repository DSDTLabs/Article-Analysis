NOIDA: Family members of   deputy general manager  , who was found dead with a bullet wound near a drain in Sector 105 last month, have written to the Prime Minister seeking a   probe into his murder, claiming that the police investigation into the case has yielded little. 
 
 Amit’s parents met Noida SSP   on Wednesday and apparently told him they were not satisfied with the pace of the investigation. Prabhat Dwivedi, Amit’s brother-in-law, said every time the family approached the police for any update, they were told that the cops were working “sincerely” in the case.
 
 The family claimed there was lack of coordination between the agencies probing the case — police in Sector 39, cyber cell and the STF.
 
 SSP Sharma said the police had found some evidence suggesting that the murder could have resulted from a robbery attempt. “The connection is not final. The family suspects it to be a murder because of his position in BHEL. However, our investigation will be based on evidence,” he said.
