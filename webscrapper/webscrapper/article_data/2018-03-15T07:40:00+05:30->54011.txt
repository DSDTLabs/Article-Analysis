Ludhiana: High drama was witnessed during a demolition drive in various areas under Zone C, when a building inspector of MC was held hostage by encroachers on Wednesday evening. The MC team from Zone C had gone for demolition of illegal shops, and one of the shop owners interrupted the drive and held the building  .

 The MC staff demolished around 32 under-construction and already constructed shops in different areas like Daba Road, Giaspura, and Lohara. The officials were dismantling shops in Krishna Colony, when one of the owners, Rajnish Tiwari, held the building inspector hostage and started indulging in an argument with him over the demolition of his shops. All arguments by the building inspector to make him understand that the commercial activity could not be carried out in the area — and the norms were not being fulfilled, due to which the commercial building plan could not be approved — failed to pacify him. The inspector was made to sit there on the site, and was not allowed to move along with machinery and other staff. The owners and other locals indulged in an argument with him, while asking the inspector to compensate for their loss.
 
 The assistant town planner of Zone C, Kuldip Mangat, said there was no building plan approval to these shops, and when they demolished the shops, some locals created a ruckus. He said the owner of these shops was not aware of the building bylaws, and moreover, he was objecting to the action by MC, saying the department had damaged their properties and caused a loss, for which they should be compensated. He said it was only when he reached the site and convinced the people, that the building inspector was released.
