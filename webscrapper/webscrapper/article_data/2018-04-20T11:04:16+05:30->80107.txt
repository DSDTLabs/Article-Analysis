CHENNAI: The National Council of Educational Research and Training ( ) has made it clear that the 18,000-odd   schools that follow its   should not give homework to children up to Class II, and only three subjects should be taught to children up to Class III.

 The council made a submission to this effect on a plea moved by advocate M Purushothaman in the Madras high court seeking a direction to CBSE to strictly adhere to the syllabus prescribed by NCERT, and not to overload the students. 
 
 Filing an affidavit in response to the plea, the NCERT also said that since in the constructivist approach, children learn to access information rather than learn by rote memorising it from book, including general knowledge – GK as a subject in school promotes rote learning.
 
 As to the practice followed by schools of dividing students into different categories such as elegant, and amazing, the council has said that such a practice would promote discrimination in the society.
 
 “The demonising effect of such labelling is devastating on children. Therefore, parents need to be vigilant about these practices, and rather than taking pride of the fact that their wards are studying in a school where these discriminating practices prevail, they need to stand against these to prevent discrimination in the society on the basis of abilities,” the council has said.
 
 According to the petitioner, the NCERT syllabus prescribes only three subjects for Class I under CBSE – mother tongue, English and mathematics. But in reality, the Class I students are forced to study eight subjects, including computer science, general knowledge and Hindi.
