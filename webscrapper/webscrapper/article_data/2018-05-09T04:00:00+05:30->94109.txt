Mumbai: Tata Steel, the second-highest bidder for the bankrupt   and Steel, has moved the appellate tribunal  , challenging a lower tribunal’s order of directing the debt-ridden company’s creditors to consider Liberty House’s offer despite the UK-based commodities player submitting the bid beyond the deadline. Because of the NCLT directive, Tata Steel, which until then was the top bidder for Bhushan Power, lost out to   by Rs 1,500 crore. Liberty House has proposed Rs 18,500 crore for Bhushan Power whereas   offered Rs 17,000 crore for the distressed asset. The $18-billion Tata Steel, in its appeal to NCLAT, has questioned the sanctity of the bankruptcy process as Liberty House had made the bid 12 days after the deadline. The appellate tribunal is expected to hear Tatas’ plea on May 9.

 Bhushan Power’s creditors had earlier rejected Liberty House’s proposal because of late submission. Subsequently, the UK-based company moved NCLT, pleading that it cannot be disqualified just because of late submission as the essence of the bankruptcy code is to maximise value for the enterprise and recovery for creditors.
