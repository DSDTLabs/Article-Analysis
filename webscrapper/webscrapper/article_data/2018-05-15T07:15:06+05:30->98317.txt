PUNE:  , including five to Delhi, took off late on Monday from the city airport.

 In the early morning hours, a   flight to Delhi was delayed by three hours and a Jet Airways flight to the same destination suffered a minor delay. Three flights, including two to Delhi, got delayed between 9am and 12 noon. Two more flights — one to Delhi and the other to Chennai — were delayed in the afternoon hours (till 3pm).
 
 An airport official said, “We don’t see any more major delays because of the weather condition, but we cannot be certain. The airlines have been told to guide the passengers in case of delays and ensure that they face minimum hassles.”
 
 The disruption in flights’ movement in the late evening hours on Sunday because of a thunderstorm in Delhi had cascading effects on flyers. Delhi’s Sahil Tyagi missed his counselling session on Monday for admission to an undergraduate course in Chennai.
 
 Sahil was going to Chennai from Delhi via Pune. His sister, Ruiya Tyagi, tweeted that the GoAir flight Sahil took to Pune on Sunday was delayed and he could not get a seat on the flight to Chennai.
 
 A detailed e-mail on the status of the flights on Sunday was sent to GoAir. Replying to the query, a GoAir spokesperson said, “The recent inclement weather in Delhi impacted flight operations out of and into Pune, resulting in diversion of flights and a delay of a few hours in certain cases. All passengers affected were provided with either alternate travel options or full refund as per their choice. GoAir regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers.”
