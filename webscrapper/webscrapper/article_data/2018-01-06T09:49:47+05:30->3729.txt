TRICHY: A newborn male baby was found dead in a sewage canal in the camp for Srilankan refugees in   in   city on Friday. It was yet another incident of babies being abandoned either dead or alive in Trichy. 

 The sanitary workers of the corporation stumbled on the dead baby floating in the sewage while cleaning the canals in the camp on Friday morning, ahead of an official team’s visit. 
 
 The camp inmates gathered at the spot as the news spread. The   police rushed to the spot on information. 
 
 A resident of the camp raised a suspicion over the refugees in the camp, because the chance of outsiders trespassing into the camp and dumping a baby in the sewage canal was very less.
 
 “It must be an insider, but we are unable to reach a conclusion. There was no precedence of such incidence. The police investigation is on, let us wait for the report,” said a refugee on condition of anonymity. 
 
 The KK Nagar police recovered the baby and sent it to   (MGMGH) for postmortem. Doctors from the city corporation said that the age of the baby could be ascertained only after the postmortem. Such incidents have happened earlier in the city. 
 
 But most of these cases remain unsolved as police were not keen in tracing them. 
 
 The KK Nagar police said that they were yet to begin the investigation as they were involved in providing security in bus depots due to the strike of   employees.
