NAVI MUMBAI: The Karjat-based boarding school for hearing- and speech-impaired children, which hit the headlines after a male   was arrested for sexually assaulting six girls aged between seven and 10, had been closed down a decade ago for  . However, in 2012, it opened in a new avatar at another location in Karjat with the same superintendent, headmistress and female caretaker with the blessings of a political party. 

 “The school was   in 1998 following irregularities in funds and   based on my complaint to the panchayat samiti. The irregularities had been detected during an audit,” claimed social worker Raghunath Dhule from  . “However, the political influence of Bharatiya Shetkari Kamgar Paksh was used to reopen the school with the same staff at a different location in Karjat (W).”
 
 On learning of the previous corrupt practices in the school, the Raigad zilla parishad chief executive officer Abhay Yavalkar said, “This is a serious issue. We will inquire how the previous staff allegedly involved in corrupt practices now operate the school under government aid.” 
 
 School superintendent Subhash Patil did not respond to calls from TOI.
 
 “Lokseva Mandal was managing Mukbadhir Niwasi, a boarding school for the hearing- and speech-impaired children, at Kashele village till it was closed down in 1998,” said a staffer, requesting anonymity. “Patil, headmistress Vimal Mundhe and others started running the school from their home in Kashele using donations. Then 17 children had to be ferried daily to a school in Khopoli. In 2012, the school was opened with a different name under the aegis of another NGO at Karjat (W) with Patil and Mundhe heading it.” 
 
 The school was transferred to private operators by the government four years ago. Currently, it has 22 boys and 18 girls and 11 staffers.
