 “In this situation, the statement given by the girl could have been discarded, had the prosecution proved the victim was minor. But the prosecution has brought nothing before the court to prove that she was a minor.”
 
 Based on the complaint lodged by the girl’s parents, the Kranti Chowk police had on June 13, 2015 registered a case against Asif Jabbar Patel (21) of Newasa in Ahmednagar district for allegedly kidnapping a minor girl from Aurangabad.

 Defence lawyer Nilesh Ghanekar contested police stated that the girl was a minor, but failed to submit even a single piece of paper to support their claim. He pointed out that it was a case of inter-caste marriage, to which the girl’s parents were opposed.
 
 The lawyer argued that during her statement before the court, the girl denied that she was raped by the accused after she fled with him to Pune.
 
 The girl produced the marriage certificate in the court and refused to identify the remaining four accused in the case, said Ghanekar.
