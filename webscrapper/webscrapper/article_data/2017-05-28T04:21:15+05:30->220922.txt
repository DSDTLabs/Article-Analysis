Gurgaon: A water   near the Basai water treatment plant has caused water problem for the residents of Sector 5, 9, 10, 4. who have seen their taps running dry since Friday evening.

 The pipeline, which originates at the Basai water treatment plant, ruptured near Sector 5.   officials tried repairing it, however, the pipeline had to be emptied using multiple suction pumps before the repair work could be started, which took several hours.
 
 “We have started the repair work but first we had to empty the pipe, which took four to five hours. We are hoping to restore the water supply by Saturday night itself,” a Huda official said.
 
 However, residents said this was a recurring problem and officials needed to upgrade the pipelines in order to avoid any such incidents in the near future and especially during summer. “We don’t have water since Friday evening and we are not expecting the supply to be restored any time soon. We are now managing with stored water and tankers, but Huda needs to work on improving the water supply infrastructure,” said J N Yadav, president, RWA, Sector 4.
 
 According to sources, the problem was that water in these pipelines travel from a lower level to a higher level as opposed to its natural flow. In order to ensure that the areas which are located on higher gradient get sufficient water with sufficient pressure, Huda releases the water with greater pressure thereby creating a stress on the already dilapidated pipeline, which often causes the water pipelines to burst.
 
 “There is an extreme shortage of water in the area, and we find it extremely difficult to manage under these circumstances. We have urged the civic authorities multiple times to upgrade the infrastructure to avoid such a situation. But all our requests have fallen on deaf ears,” said Dinesh Vashisht, president, Sector 5 RWA.
