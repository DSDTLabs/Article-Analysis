KOLKATA: App cabs became pricey and hard to find on Dol and Holi days as majority of drivers remained off the road, some to be part of the revelry and others to ensure the white cabs don’t get soiled with colours.

 The commuters, who had been banking on app cabs considering the limited public transport options available, had harrowing time on both the days. Around 9pm on Thursday, a 7km ride from Esplanade to Howrah station showed an estimated fare of Rs 540. The usual fare on normal days is between Rs 90 and Rs 120.
 
 An Uber official said since the driver partners are not legally bound employees of the company, the company can’t dictate them to be on the road. He denied that the fleet had shrunk by more than half. Drivers, however, put the shortage at about 75% on Thursday and around 50% on Friday.
 
 Even a lure of extra incentives from the firm could not persuade drivers to hit the road. The official explained the move to incentivise drivers led to increase in fares. “Features like Heat Map in the driver app help us maintain marketplace efficiency by directing drivers to geographical areas with high demand, so as to ensure that availability and demand pressures balance out at the earliest,” he said.
 
 Drivers claim over the past two years, incentives have dwindled and that is why the situation has changed over the past one year. “The incentives have got halved with both Ola and Uber. And that is the reason, on days like Dol and Holi, I don’t bring out my car anymore. It’s not worth it. The exterior as well as interior of the car gets soiled with colours and it is difficult to remove,” said Asish Thakur, who has three cabs.
 
 Another driver, Chandan Dutta, said he avoided to take out his car on both the days since he didn’t want undue hassles. “On these two days, most riders are either drunk or are drenched and smeared in colours. They not only soil the car but also get engaged in undue brawls. I just wanted to avoid the situation,” he said.
