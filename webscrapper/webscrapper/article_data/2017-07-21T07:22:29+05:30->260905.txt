CHENNAI: The   in   continue to bleed money. The total accumulated losses at the end of 2015-16 stood at Rs 16,145 crore, the report of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) shows.

 Of the total losses, Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC), which serves Chennai and its adjoining districts, contributes the maximum with a loss of Rs 2,502 crore.   earned Rs 634 crores in 2015-16, a drop of Rs 20 crore from the previous financial year. Corresponding figures for all corporations were Rs 8,880 crore, a drop of Rs 210 crore from 2014-15.
 
 The reasons are evident in the figures provided by CAG. While the number of buses had gone up by 730, the effective distance covered by these buses up went by 15 crore kilometres and the number of operating staff increased by 3,000 in comparison to 2014-15, the number of passengers that travelled in these buses, however, dropped by 1.7 crore than the previous year.
 
 Figures show that only two transport corporations, TNSTC Coimbatore and Kumbakonam, ferried more passengers. MTC lost 3 crore passengers during the period. That not even a single new route was introduced in 2014-16 by any corporation could have contributed to the falling revenue. The earnings per kilometre dropped from Rs 28 to Rs 26.24.
 
 CAG data shows that to counter falling incomes, MTC spent Rs 86 crore less on diesel, Rs 1.6 crore less on tyres and Rs 1 crore less on spare parts. But the wage bill went up by Rs 270 crore. These figures are contiguous with those for all the state corporations combined; the expenditure on diesel dropped by Rs 518 crores and on tyres by Rs 12.8 crores from 2014-15 to 2015-16. The salary bill increased by Rs 596 crores.
