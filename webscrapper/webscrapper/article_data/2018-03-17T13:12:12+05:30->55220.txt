NAGPUR: The city police have released CCTV image of the alleged abductor of two four-year-old children earlier this week. He had then abandoned them at the   (GMCH).

 On Wednesday, the city police had an unsettling few hours after Shraddha Sarwane was abducted from Juni Mangalwari. There was relief after she was found at GMCH. 
 
 Police then came across CCTV footages in which the culprit was spotted with the minor. The drama was yet to be solved when the kidnapping of Harshal Gosavi from Gayatri Nagar a day earlier came to fore. Violating Supreme Court orders in such matters, the   police had not registered a case.
 
 The city police, including several squads of the crime branch, have stepped up the search for the kidnapper. They feel that the man might be suffering from some mental ailment and kidnapping for ransom may not have been his motive.
 
 “In the CCTV footages recovered, the man did not seem to trouble Shraddha. On the contrary, he seemed very caring. He sneaked away after asking the girl to wait at a spot. This are no records of a kidnapper with a criminal mentality,” said a cop. 
 
 Apart from the slums in south Nagpur, the police have spent several hours at the GMCH where the kidnapper was last captured on CCTV. The police are learnt to have approached patients, kin, doctors, nurses and other hospital staffers including the security personnel with the CCTV grab of the kidnapper for some clues.
 
 The cops, who have procured the images of the man from more CCTVs at different places in the city, are hoping to trace the two-wheeler with the help of it’s registration number.
 
 The cops are also in the opinion that the kidnapper is likely from south Nagpur as he is spotted in many CCTV camera footages returning alone after abandoning the girl at GMCH.
