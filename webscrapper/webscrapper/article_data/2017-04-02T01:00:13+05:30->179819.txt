Navi Mumbai: The state Public Works Department’s superintending engineer at Chembur office had taken serious note of a complaint by a Vashi resident about defunct streetlights on   highway. 

 Bharat Samant (58), had sent a mail to   authorities, highlighting the accident-prone stretch from Vashi toll plaza till CBD-Belapur due to defunct streetlights.
 
 The PWD authorities dashed off a letter (dated March 30, 2017), issuing strict warning to the concerned agency, Sion Panvel Tollways Private Limited ( ), which is responsible for maintenance of the Sion-Panvel highway. 
 
 SPTPL must ensure that all the streetlights on the highway stretch are operational with immediate effect, said a PWD official.
 
 The letter also mentions that in case of any fatal accident of vehicles due to defunct streetlights causing poor visibility, SPTPL will be held responsible for failing to maintain the highway.
 
 A PWD official, requesting anonymity, said, “As per the rules of the tender agreement, SPTPL has to maintain the highway in good condition. It must also ensure that the streetlights are operational and properly illuminated. The agency has been instructed to take corrective measure without delay. ”
 
 SPTPL’s operations manager, Prashant Sonmale said, “There are five transformers installed in different nodes for the streetlights. The streetlights along the stretch between Vashi toll plaza and Sanpada are often switched off often due to glitches in the transformer located at  . To resolve the problem, we will replace the transformer soon.”
 
 He added that some light poles from Nerul till Uran Phata are switched off due to cable faults, while others with defunct bulbs are being replaced by carrying out inspection of the highway.
