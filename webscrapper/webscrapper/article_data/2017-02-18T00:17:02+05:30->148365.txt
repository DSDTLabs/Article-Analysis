NEW DELHI: The   is certain that the Delhi MLAs need a   and will respond to the queries raised by the Centre while returning the legislative proposal for the same. 

 On Friday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the proposal was an attempt to ensure clean politics.   “should either reveal the formula of how MLAs and MPs were getting rich despite low pay or clear the proposal for raising the MLAs salary”, Sisodia said. 
 
 Taking a dig at BJP, he added, “Our MLAs do not indulge in corruption...while their (BJP) MLAs and MPs come on scooter initially and have expensive houses, cars, five-star hotels and farm houses after five years.” In Delhi, too, Sisodia said, many councillors just have two-wheelers at the beginning but have expensive cars and properties at the end of the five-year term.
 
 Claiming that Delhi has one of the lowest basic   of Rs 12,000, Sisodia said the government was open to a debate but would pursue the subject till the end. 
 
 The government’s media adviser, Nagendra Sharma, took to Twitter suggesting that there was a misconception that the MLAs were given a 400% hike. As per the proposal, the basic salary should be increased from Rs 12,000 to Rs 50,000, constituency allowance from Rs 18,000 to Rs 50,000, telephone allowance from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 and conveyance allowance from Rs 6,000 to Rs 30,000. It also allocated Rs 70,000 for reimbursement of up to four staff. In all, the proposal sought to increase the monthly package to Rs 2.1 lakh from Rs 88,000. 
 
 Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken said CM Arvind Kejriwal and his partymen had promised to shun all symbols of power. But “is it not hypocritical that they are now demanding such a steep salary hike?” he asked.
