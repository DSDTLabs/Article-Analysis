And what's better than her son producing her husband's comeback film? It's just perfect! What made it even more perfect is the fact that it turned out to be one of the biggest hits for all of us,' says Charan, adding, 'It shows how much people love dad and how eagerly they were waiting to see him back onscreen. we had to make it big; it was nanna garu's come back film and we've all worked really hard for it.' 
Now, RC has an even bigger task cut out for him ' to recreate the   magic with his next production, starring Chiru yet again. But the choice wasn't his, he tell us: 'He (Chiru) chose me to be his next producer! I am humbled and fortunate for his faith in me. Having said that, nanna garu is also open to work with other producers, if they approach him with a good story. He believes that the story is the protagonist of any film.'
  who directed Ram Charan's  , is helming the project. 'Suri has come to us with a great subject which nanna garu felt he could do justice to. He has already proven himself with his stylish, new age style of filmmaking in Dhruva. So we decided to go ahead with Surender Reddy for our next as well,' explains Cherry. 
 Although the Mega Power star is too tight-lipped about the project, he shares that he is looking forward to working with his father again. 'Everyday with dad is a learning process, whether at work or at home. It's always a pleasure to work with him,' he says, signing off.
