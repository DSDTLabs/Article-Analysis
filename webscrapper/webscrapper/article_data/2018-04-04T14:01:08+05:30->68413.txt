PANAJI: Town and country planning ( ) minister   Sardesai on Tuesday said dissenting statements by various leaders, agitations despite demands being met, and social media campaigns were being undertaken to destabilise the government. 

 Sardesai, who is an ally of the BJP-led coalition government, also said he would never backstab chief minister Manohar Parrikar while he was undergoing medical treatment.
 
 His comment comes in light of recent opposition to government decisions regarding planning and development authorities (PDA) and the Regional Plan (RP) 2021. 
 
 Sardesai further said he was informed that parishioners of a North Goa church were, on Good Friday, urged to participate in a morcha on April 6 to demand the exclusion of the new areas that were proposed to be brought under the purview of the   (GPPDA). The following day, the government announced that villages within the St Andre and   constituencies, which were proposed to be included in the GPPDA, had been dropped, and that only Taleigao and the Kadamba plateau were retained.
 
 “Where is the issue when the people have won? I spoke to the archbishop and asked him if what was happening was right,” the TCP minister said, even as he termed the motive behind the April 6 protest march from Patto Plaza to Azad Maidan in Panaji illegitimate.
 
 Reacting to demands that the village of Taleigao too, be dropped from the GPPDA,   said not a single person from Taleigao had opposed the village’s inclusion as it was always part of the   (NGPDA).
