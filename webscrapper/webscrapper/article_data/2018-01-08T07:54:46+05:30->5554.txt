AHMEDABAD: Amid announcements for fliers,   recalled a passage from   that he had piloted. Pandit Sharma, the santoor deity, was proceeding to board a flight on Sunday, a day after his Saptak performance. “I played Kirwani,” Panditji told TOI over the phone. “In the late 1970s, I played that raga — accompanied by   — when a music company wanted to release the first LP record of a live concert.” He said his instinct had guided him to reprise Kirwani. Panditji’s musical essays always carry the nostalgia of his pioneering boldness: his greatness lies as much in his eminence as in his curiosity to test the limits of art.

 Saturday also yielded a valuable exposition on Raga Kedar. “I presented vilambit and drut compositions in that raga at Saptak,”   told TOI. “Kedar is established typically by the use of long, unbroken meend — or glides — within certain key phrases of the raag.” She said the vilambit composition gave her scope to explore these phrases. “The drut composition ‘Damini damake chamake ri’ describes the flash of the bindi on the forehead of a beautiful lady,” Mudgal said. “The sparkle in the composition demands appropriate flourishes and I attempted to deliver them.”
 
 Accompanying Mudgal was Aneesh Pradhan, a tabla virtuoso and a great elucidator of music. To understand how he transmits intellect to his drumming fingers to establish a concord with Mudgal’s customary majesty, one can turn to his book “Tabla: A Performer’s Perspective”. Pradhan writes in the chapter ‘Sangat’: “Listeners wonder whether tabla players rehearse every piece of Hindustani music that they are accompanying. A negative reply astounds them…”. Then he says: “…performers share an understanding of the basic design involved in the structuring of compositions…and other such details that form the core of any Hindustani music performance.” With Mudgal, Pradhan gave an affecting show of that core.
