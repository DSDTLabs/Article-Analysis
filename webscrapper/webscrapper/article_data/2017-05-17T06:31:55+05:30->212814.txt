NEW DELHI: A day after he ended his hunger strike, sacked minister   approached   with “evidence” against CM   and two   MLAs.

 “We have submitted   of irregularities in donations, black money used to fund AAP and involvement of shell companies to CBI,” Mishra said after coming out of CBI office. Mishra was accompanied by his friend Neil Haslam. 
 
 Neil, who claims to be a former AAP worker, has reportedly helped Mishra find the documents, on the basis of which the latter had levelled allegations of corruption against Kejriwal.
 
 “The truth will soon come out before the public. Now Arvind Kejriwal cannot escape,” he later tweeted.
 
 Mishra claimed that the income tax department had initiated probe after he exposed the “nexus of shell companies”. 
 
 He, however, did not go to   as claimed earlier. “I will go to CBDT on Wednesday,” he said. 
 
 On May 9, Mishra had filed three complaints with CBI against Kejriwal in connection with alleged exchange of Rs 2 crore in cash between the CM and minister  , foreign trips undertaken by senior AAP functionaries, besides other issues. 
 
 The former water resources minister has been levelling allegations of corruption against Kejriwal and AAP functionaries ever since he was axed from the cabinet.
