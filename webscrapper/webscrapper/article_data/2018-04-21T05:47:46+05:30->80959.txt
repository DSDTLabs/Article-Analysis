AHMEDABAD: Former   minister  , who was acquitted by the Gujarat high court in the Naroda Patia massacre case, was seen neither at the court on Friday nor at her two residences all through the day.

 Mediapersons thronged her sprawling bungalow at   near Shyamal crossroads in Ahmedabad to get her reaction after the high court exonerated her in the riot case. A man who identified himself as Kodnani’s personal security officer said, “Ben went to   temple after the verdict and she will not return until late evening.” A car was parked outside her house with “Ex-MLA of Gujarat” emblazoned on the number-plate.
 
 
 Sources said that Kodnani is a staunch believer in Chudel Mata (witch goddess) whose temple is nicknamed the ‘High Court of Kungher’. Kodnani may have deemed it fit to offer thanks at the temple after the high court delivered a verdict in her favour.
 
  say that she is renowned for her intervention in legal cases being faced by her devotees. That’s why the temple has been dubbed the high court.
 
 Rush of devotees has only risen over the past two to three years because of the favourable word-of-mouth publicity.
 
 Kodnani’s husband   said of the judgment: “It is due to the grace of mataji.”
