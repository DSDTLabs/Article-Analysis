Bhopal: In 2008 assembly elections, BJP’s major target is to win all assembly seats in   and Guna Lok Sabha constituencies. These were the only two seats the party lost in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when the ruling party bagged 27 out of 29 seats. Later, however, the BJP lost Ratlam to the Congress in a bypoll in November 2015 after the demise of Dilip Singh Bhuria. “The BJP’s mission for 2019 is to win all 29 Lok Sabha seats,” said BJP national vice-president Prabhat Jha. “BJP is particularly keen on Guna represented by Jyotiraditya Scindia and Chhindwara by Kamal Nath. But to ensure that they start packing their bags, we first have to win all assembly seats in these two Lok Sabha constituencies.” Chhindwara has seven assembly constituencies and BJP has its MLAs in four, including Junnardeo, Chaurai, Sausar and Chhindwara. Congress holds Amarwara, Parasia and Pandorna.

 Guna has eight assembly seats, of which four are held by the Congress and one more seat, Mungawali, also with the party got vacated earlier this month after the death of former minister and senior legislator Mahendra Singh Kalukhera. Four sitting Congress MLAs are from the assembly seats of Pichhore, Bamori, Kolaras and Chanderi. BJP has MLAs in Shivpuri (held by Jyotiraditya Scindia’s aunt Yashodhara Raje), Guna and Ashokenagar.
 
 During BJP national chief Amit Shah’s visit to the state last month, his clear instructions were to work on how to defeat the two Congress stalwarts and capture the Congress Chhindwara and Guna fortresses. “For the BJP, getting the assembly seats of Guna and Chhindwara will be a cakewalk,” Jha claimed. “Kamal Nath and Scindia are engaged in a fight over who will be given the charge to lead Congress during the assembly elections. I am not in favour of Digvijaya Singh. But truth is that in the Congress he is still the tallest leader in the state simply because he was chief minister for ten years and is known in all parts of the state.”
