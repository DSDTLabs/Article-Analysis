NAGPUR: “Let there be no anger, let there be no passion, that is sensually driven. Let not greed in you breed. Let not jealously and pride ever override you.” These lines of Dasbodh were expressed by   in a series of programme organized by   on the occasion of upcoming Dasnavmi on February 20.

 The theme for the third day was ‘Dasbodhatil Saundarya Ani Yog’. The programme was held at   on Monday.
 
 Giving an insight into Dasbodh and to the life of Samarth Ramdas, Swami Madhavanand said that he was the shinning jewel in the glorious tradition of saints of Maharashtra. “He always had this belief that sainthood comes only after renouncing your family life and living in a forest like an ascetic,” he said.
 
 Swami said that everyone should at least read Dasbodh once in their life as it deals with diverse aspects of human life, including politics, conducting business dealings and taking care of one’s body and family.
 
 “Samartha has done a volume of writing along with his social work. He has touched all sides of human life, from how to write letters having proper turns, to the duties and conduct of the politician. It has everything,” the Swami said.
 
 “Samartha Ramdas presents the essence of many Vedic texts in Dasbodh. Dasbodh is a complete manual for life, it teaches you and guides you on how to deal in the society and how to maintain your relations at workplace. It provides detailed instruction on how to function and excel in society,” he said.
 
 “The best course for enjoying everlasting pleasure is to spend one’s time in devotion to god. Giving up bodily pleasure and sensual desires proves beneficial for this,” he added.
