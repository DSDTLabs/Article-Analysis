As a child growing up in a small town of eastern Uttar Pradesh, I would continuously hear stories of my grandfather's journey-how a farmer's son became a great educationist and brought about a positive change in his village. Having had great educational opportunities, I knew I had to contribute similarly in constructive and meaningful ways. 

 
 I began my journey four years ago with a grassroots organization after I earned a  ,  , and MA in human resource management from  . I dabbled in everything from managing donors to communications to implementing various programmes. The experience of performing duties across diverse functions built my technical skills. I would always suggest that begin with small organisations as they provide greater scope for larger responsibilities and deep experiences.
 
 Myriad stereotypes exist about individuals who work in social sector. However, the sector, just like any other sector, demands extreme resilience, adaptability and right skills. Of course, a mission-driven individual is a prerequisite, but there is also a greater demand to match technical skills with passion. Many formal entry routes exist through multiple social sector fellowships and programmes offered by formal institutions, not-for-profit organisations as well as multinational corporations. 
 
 In social sector, avenues in research, consulting,  , in public and private sectors exist. But the point is, there's nothing like having a career that gives you a strong sense of purpose. All you need is the right intent to reach out.
