Ghaziabad: An expert panel appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to study sources of pollution in Kaushambi on the UP-Delhi border in Ghaziabad has zeroed in on the lack of civic sense and encroachments. The panel has also identified waste residue burning in the open and lack of roads as other causes of pollution in the township that abuts Anand Vihar in east Delhi.

 The panel, which comprised officials of the pollution control boards of UP and Delhi, apart from those belonging to Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC), submitted its report to the tribunal on March 22. A field visit and survey had been conducted by the panel members in the area on February 23.
 
 “The crux of the problem is encroachment, lack of civic sense, waste residue burning and lack of roads in the area. If these conditions are taken care of, the area will be improved,” the panel has observed in the report. Delhi’s pollution watchdog, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), has mentioned in the report that it has issued show-cause notices to 126 units in the Patparganj Industrial Area, asking them as to why they should not be shut down. These industrial units have been found to be operating without the consent of the DPCC.
 
 The panel had been formed by the principal bench of the tribunal, headed by Justice Swatanter Kumar, on February 9, to survey pollution-related issues in the township on the basis of a petition filed by Kaushambi Apartments RWAs (KARWA).
 
 In its report, the panel has suggested various long-term and short-term measures to control and minimise pollution in the area. It has primarily recommended for modernisation of the UP State Road Transport Corporation bus depot in Kaushambi and ISBT in Anand Vihar in a time-bound manner to improve the environment of the area. Proper design of intersections and roads for smooth flow of traffic in the area has been recommended.
