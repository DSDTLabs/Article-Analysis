HYDERABAD: There seems to be no end to the stand-off between the TRS government and   (T-JAC) chairman   with the latter firm on holding a public meeting in Hyderabad to highlight the unemployment issue in the state and the former keen on thwarting it.

 On Tuesday , the state government told the high court that it cannot allow the public meeting to be held in the city and instead suggested Nagole as the venue and wanted the event to be put off to Sunday , February 26, instead of the scheduled Wednesday , February 22.
 
 However, even as Justice A   was dictating the order permitting the meeting to be held at Nagole, Kodandaram withdrew the T-JAC petition, saying that he is determined to hold the public meeting in Hyderabad and on Wednesday as planned.
 
 As a result, the simmering war between former col leagues chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Kodandaram sees no sign of abating.
 
 With Kondandaram in sisting on going ahead with his protest on Wednesday , the state has deployed 2 companies of   (RAF), over 5,000 police personnel and set up pickets at entry points to Hyderabad to prevent TJAC supporters from reaching the city .
