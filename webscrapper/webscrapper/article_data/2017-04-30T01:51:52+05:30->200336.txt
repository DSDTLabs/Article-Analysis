NEW DELHI: The acknowledgement of mistakes in the municipal elections by chief minister and   national convener Arvind   may have won him praises from his supporters, but for   and   “his admission of mistakes is nothing but an emotional drama to fool the people of Delhi again.”

 Describing it as a new drama, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said: “It is nothing but an emotional political drama. He has done it in past and is doing it again. He makes mistakes knowingly and then seeks apologies.” 
 
 Tiwari said that in 2014, Kejriwal had stepped down 49 days after becoming the   for the first time and apologised to the people.
 
 “He changes colour like a chameleon and then apologises. Now people have understood his tricks,” Tiwari added. 
 
 More acerbic in his comments, leader of opposition in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta said: “The municipal election was a referendum against AAP. After the party’s humiliating defeat Kejriwal is changing his stand every day. Initially the blamed the EVMs and now Kejriwal has sought apology accepting mistakes. It is all part of AAP’s political strategy.”
 
 Gupta claimed that there is no internal democracy within the party and it was headed towards destruction.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress — which was pushed to the third position as the municipal elections saw a tight contest between BJP and AAP — claimed that the apologies tendered by Kejriwal lack sincerity.
 
 “To pursue his prime ministerial ambitions Kejriwal left people of Delhi, who elected him. He was badly defeated and came back to the people with apologies,” said Sharmistha Mukherjee, chief spokesperson of Delhi Congress.
 
 She alleged that “Kejriwal is again doing the same thing with a belief that he can fool people of Delhi yet again. However, his insincerity has been exposed,” she said.
