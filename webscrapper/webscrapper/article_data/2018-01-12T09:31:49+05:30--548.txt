VISAKHAPATNAM: In a tragic incident just ahead of Sankranti, two students drowned in the   reservoir on the outskirts of the city where they had gone for a swim on Thursday. 

 The deceased were identified as S   of Sabbavaram and P Srikar of NAD Junction.
 
 Both the boys, aged 17, were students of Sri Chaitanya College’s NAD branch.
 
 A group of 13 Intermediate second year students had gone to the reservoir at around 3 pm on Thursday after the college closed for the Sankranti holidays. The students had gone to have a swim at the reservoir before going their separate ways to their homes for the week-long holiday.
 
 Sources said it was Srikar who first ventured into the water. However, he went a little too deep, and not knowing how to swim, began to drown.
 
 On hearing his friend’s shouts for help, Jagadeesh jumped into the water in a bid to save Srikar. However, he was unable to save him and both the boys drowned.
 
 Another boy jumped in to help the duo but after finding no trace of them, he managed to swim back to safety.
 
 Locals who were present at the spot called the Pendurthy police, who rushed to the reservoir. 
 
 Swimmers were deployed, who managed to fish out Srikar’s body. However, there was no trace of Jagadeesh’s body till late evening, after which swimmers abandoned the search operation due to darkness. The search will resume on Friday morning.
