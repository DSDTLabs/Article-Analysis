Panaji: The state directorate of transport in a letter addressed to Captain of Ports (CoP) has demanded that the use of high intensity focus lights by river cruise vessels plying on the Mandovi river be banned. “It has come to the notice of this department (transport) that some river cruise vessels plying in River Mandovi are using high intensity tracer/focus lights on their decks and the same is projected in such a manner that could lead to a major distraction of drivers/motorists who are plying their vehicles on Mandovi bridge as well as along the DB Marg,” transport director Nikhil Desai said in the letter. Desai said that the possibility of fatal accidents occurring, due to the practice of using high intensity tracer lights, could not be ruled out.  The lights endanger “the life and property of the motorists and pedestrians” and steps have to be taken to prevent “any untoward accident” on account of their usage, the letter stated. The transport department has requested Captain of Ports to issue necessary directions to all vessels plying on the Mandovi river not to use such tracers/high intensity focus lights and that they “be banned with immediate effect.”
