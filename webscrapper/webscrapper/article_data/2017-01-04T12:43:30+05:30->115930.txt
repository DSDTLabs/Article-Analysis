VADODARA:   of state-run Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals ( ) Limited on Tuesday staged a ‘dharna’ protest and went on strike. 

 The agitators alleged that GSFC on Monday laid off as many as 1,165 contractual workers without issuing the necessary showcause notices. Sources in the company, however, suggested that the dispute is between the contractors and their work force in which the company has no role to play. 
 
 “The company has laid off contract workers from various departments without even bothering to issue them a show cause notice. It has not given any explanation for the extreme step. These workers have been working in the company since last 15 to 20 years and some of them are also physically handicapped,” said  , general secretary of Vadodara district Congress samiti, who led a group of protestors that staged dharna outside the company premises on Tuesday noon. 
 
 “We have demanded an explanation from the management and given them an ultimatum. On Wednesday too we will stage protest outside the main gate of the company. If the management fails to provide any concrete explanation we will take out a scooter rally from the company and submit memorandums to district collector and labour commissioner demanding their intervention,” said Bhatt.
