NEW DELHI: A central panel, set up in April to study the role of cow urine and dung in curing diseases and scientific validation of uniqueness of indigenous cows, is likely to have its first meeting next month when it will assign various projects to ministries and institutions.

 The panel, headed by science and technology minister  , will evaluate the role of ‘Panchagavya’ — a concoction of cow urine mixed with cow dung, milk, curd and ghee — in four broad areas like medicine, products for agriculture applications, food and nutrition and utility products.
 
 Besides eminent scientists like former   director general R A Mashelkar, the panel has members from RSS and VHP-linked organisations. The tenure of this panel will be for three years. “Though the panel —   ( ) — was constituted long ago, it could not meet so far due to one or the other important engagements of its members,” said V K Vijay of the Centre for Rural Development and Technology (CRDT), IITDelhi. He is one of the members of the 19-member panel.
 
 Amid indication of its first meeting some time next month, Vijay told TOIon Sunday that the panel will function as an apex body for guiding a national programme on ‘Scientific Validation and Research on Panchgavya’.
 
 TOI had in February reported the government’s plan to form such a committee. The panel includes chancellor of   in Bihar Vijay P Bhatkar, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao and secretaries of the departments of science & technology, biotechnology and renewable energy. Other members include Sunil Mansinghka of VHPlinked Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra which has long been involved in research on cow urine and cow dung.
