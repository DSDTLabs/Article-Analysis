Chandigarh: Clarifying he had no objection to Navjot Singh Sidhu’s continuing with television shows if it was constitutionally permissible, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said he would wait for the state advocate general’s advice on the matter.

 Talking to newspersons at Parliament House after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, Amarinder said Sidhu was a “sensible and intelligent person” and would have checked his legal and constitutional position in the matter of working for TV shows before joining the state cabinet as a minister.
 
 “Since I am personally not aware of the constitutional position in this regard, I will wait for the AG’s advice,” said the chief minister, adding that if Sidhu’s culture portfolio was found to be in conflict with his television work, his ministry could be changed.
 
 To a question on the proposed meeting of a delegation from Haryana, led by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, with the Union home minister on the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue on March 24, Amarinder said the matter was sub-judice and his government was pursuing it legally to protect the water rights of the people of Punjab.
 
 In reply to a question on the role of I-PAC’s Prashant Kishor in the recently concluded Punjab assembly elections, the CM said Prashant had done a great job and had been instrumental in crafting a poll-winning strategy for his party.
