BHOPAL: Keeping up with the awe-inspiring performances, the fourth day of Lokrang gave the art lovers a taste of Russian and African culture.

 The audience sat wide eyed when the African acrobats presented their performance. The group’s gymnastic skills, hoop diving and fire limbo drew a huge cheer from everyone. The incredible formation and balancing act of the four international artistes left them wanting for more.
 
 Ending on a thundering applause, the performance was followed by a candelabra dance performed by Russian dancers. The artistes balanced heavy candelabras on their head and danced in synchronised movements wowing the audience. The music lovers too were in for a treat and flocked the Gandharva exhibition which showcased traditional aero-phone instruments. Put together by the   Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya, Tribal Arts and Dialects Development Academy and the  , MP, the exhibition gave an insight into the tribal musical instruments of India.
 
 More than 200 aero-phone instruments or ‘Sushira Vadya’ of different tribes were on display. Anup Ranjan Pande, a theatre personality and founder of the ‘Bastar band’ travelled to many tribal areas to collect the instruments.
 
 Pande said, “All the exhibited instruments have been made from bamboo, leaves, horns of buffalo and bottle guard. Nothing is artificial. While some are played before a war, there are others that are used to show devotion to God. Some of these instruments are also used to communicate over large distances.” Mashak which resembles the bagpipes is used during celebrations in parts of Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Instruments like Bansuri, Singha, Meer, Morchang, Mohar are displayed at the exhibition.
