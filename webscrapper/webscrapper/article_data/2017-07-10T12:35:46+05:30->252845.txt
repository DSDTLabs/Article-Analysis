JAIPUR: Rajasthan prison guards on Sunday called off their indefinite hunger strike after senior officials of home and prison department assured them of resolving their grievances regarding pay-scale disparities. 

 Senior officials of the home department accompanied DG (Jail) Ajit Singh and held a meeting with the protesters at Rajasthan Jail headquarters in the city on Sunday afternoon.
 
 "The government delegation met us and promised to resolve the pay-scale discrepancies between   and jail guards. The prison guards across the state have called off the strike," said deputy jailor,   (JAC),  , adding that Ajit Singh and other officials would send a proposal to the finance department and speak to the chief minister if required.
 
 For the past two weeks, prison guards had been protesting against pay discrepancies. The guards demanded that their pay scale be made similar to that of Rajasthan police constables. The protesters said that in contrast with police force, the jail employees are underpaid. "For many years now, we have been requesting the government to remove the pay-scale discrimination and bring us at par with our counterparts in Rajasthan Police," Sharma said, adding that grade pay for a sub-inspector in Rajasthan Police is Rs 4,200, but deputy jailor (counterpart of sub-inspector) is paid only Rs 2,800. "The   (RPSC) organises examinations for both the departments, and yet we have been singled out and paid less," said Sharma. The guards launched a hunger strike in which 100 guards fell unconscious and were rushed to the hospitals. The guards in Ajmer, Udaipur, Sawai Madhopur, Kota, Sri Ganganagar and Jodhpur too joined the protests. Sources said that over 120 protesters fell ill due to hunger strike, compelling the government to speak to the officials.
