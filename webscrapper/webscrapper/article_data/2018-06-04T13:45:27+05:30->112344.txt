PATNA: A probe has been ordered into an audio clip in which   S A   is allegedly heard asking a girl for sexual favours, ADG (headquarters) S K Singhal said on Sunday. “Strict action will be taken if the   was found guilty,” he said. The audio clip surfaced on Saturday night. 

 
 “The audio clip will be sent for forensic analysis to ascertain if it was Hashmi’s voice,” Singhal said, adding DIG (central range) Rajesh Kumar would look into the matter.
 
 Hashmi said the clip is fake. “Bring the girl before me if she exists and had recorded the clip,” said Hashmi, who was promoted to DSP rank last year.
 
 Following the audio clip, a news portal on Sunday showed a video of Hashmi in police uniform begging a scribe to destroy the audio clip for which “he would do anything in return”. In the video clip, Hashmi is seen pleading to the scribe that the audio would destroy his reputation if it went viral on social media.
 
 Sources said the girl in her early 20s had approached Hashmi after her parents faced some problems and police did not lodge her complaint. Sources said the voice recording is at least a month old.
 
 Sources said Hashmi had allegedly taken the girl somewhere in a four-wheeler and, during conversation, he had asked for sexual favours from her. Hashmi was allegedly heard asking the girl to make him “happy” and he would do anything for her.
 
 Sources said the girl recorded the conversation as evidence. The audio clip is of one-and-a-half minutes duration. Hashmi is also heard asking the girl for her photograph when she requested him to drive fast as it was already 7.30pm. Later, Hashmi told her to catch a public transport.
