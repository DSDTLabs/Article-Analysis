HYDERABAD: A massive operation is underway at the city's income tax (I-T) office where sleuths from its investigation wing are busy scrutinizing dozens of bank accounts that saw huge deposits, on and after November 8, the day Prime Minister   announced   of high-value currency. 

 Speaking exclusively to TOI, a senior tax official on Tuesday said   have so far zeroed in on 100 (approx.) accounts, belonging to people from various economic strata, that saw 1 crore or more being deposited into them since the Centre's demonitisation move last year. 
 
 "We are in the process of examining each of these accounts closely to verify the source of the money. If we are satisfied with our findings and the source appears to be genuine, we will close the matter there. But in case the accounts raise any suspicion we will take a decision on whether to go ahead with a search/survey thereafter," said the official.
 
 All of this money, consisted of demonetised 500 and 1,000 notes. Given the magnitude of the exercise, officials said the I-T department has roped in an additional group of 30 inspectors. 
 
 "This is over and above the 40 inspectors who constitute the investigations team here. Together, they are looking at accounts, active in both nationalized and private banks in the city," the senior official shared.
