NAGPUR: For the first time in its history, Nationalist   Party (NCP) along with its allies has decided to contest from all the seats of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The party issued a list of over 120 candidates on Saturday evening. The remaining seats will be contested by its allies,   (IUML) and Republican Party of India (RPI) factions. Last time NCP had contested 29 seats and won only from six.

 Sujata, wife of MLC Prakash Gajbhiye, has been given ticket from seat 13A. Three sitting corporators Kamil Ansari, Duneshwar Pethe and Rajkumar Nagulwar also figure in the list. Sunil, husband of corporator Seema Raut, has also been given the party ticket. Former corporators Vedprakash Arya and Nanda Zodape, Jaya, wife of ex-corporator Ashok Katle and some other known names figure in the list too. 
 
 Three Congress rebels Deva Usre, Kusum Ghate and Mamta Gedam have been given tickets from Ward 9. Women NCP leaders Nutan Rewatkar and Varsha Shamkule will also try their luck on party symbols.
 
 While   and Congress had announced their lists on Friday, the last date of filing nominations, NCP provided its list to the media only on Saturday evening, after scrutiny of nominations was over. The reason is that NCP gave tickets to several outsiders and waited till the last moment to net in Congress rebels.
