NURPUR(KANGRA): On his first visit to this constituency, which shares border with Punjab,   Pradesh chief minister   reiterated his resolve to end political discrimination in the state. The chief minister made the announcement while addressing a gathering of around 4,000 here on Saturday.

 Referring to old habits of people wearing a particular colour cap in a show of solidarity to a political party, he said, “I have ended this now. I don’t wear a cap. In case, I have to, then I don’t go for any particular colour – be it red or green.”   supporters in Himachal are generally known to wear green caps, while those of BJP, red.
 
 “Besides, there also used to be a tussle between political parties here over the CM being from high hills or lower hills. With me as CM, that too has ended as I belong to mid hills,” he added.
 
 On a lighter note, he recalled his early days as CM, when “people asked me to remove my moustache”. He said people told him that the state had never had a CM with a moustache. “I refused,” he said.
 
 “We have removed all tired and retired officials, except patwaris as we are compelled to keep them till the new batch is inducted,” he said.
 
 Thakur added that he had met Union defense minister and proposed to upgrade the Gaggal airport in Kangra district. “The Centre has asked us to broaden the airstrip,” he said.
