NAGPUR: With an aim to make the city free from  , NGO Deen   of Medical Science and Human Resource has introduced a modern technology, which it claims is even new to the nation.

 Using   (IBE) machine under the ‘breast cancer screening programme’, the NGO aims to diagnose about 4 lakh women free of cost and sponsor the treatment of suspected cases. Union minister for road transport and highways   will launch the programme, on Sunday, to be being held at Dr Munje Hall in Mahal.
 
 Claiming that the city is on top in the number of breast cancer cases in India, NGO director Dr Viral Kamdar, said, “It’s sad that the poor still cannot afford to have early detection of breast cancer even in government facilities. Moreover, women from low socio-economic background are hesitant to go to any government facility in the city to get the diagnosis done. If people from rural areas and slums can’t reach us, it becomes our duty to reach them.”
 
 For that reason, a Tata Winger with ‘Janani Sehat Rath’ written on it will be roaming around rural areas and slums across the city to reach poor women. Small camps will be organized where women will be diagnosed on the spot. “Against the conventional system, IBE will hardly take 10 minutes to scan one woman and will give the report immediately,” Kamdar said.
 
 If a woman is found positive, she will be taken to   and Hospital or Indira Gandhi Government Medical College to get rest of the tests done. “We will give complete financial support to the women throughout the treatment with the help of Chief Minister Health Relief Fund and donations,” Kamdar said.
