Rapper   was in Noida on Friday, when we caught up with him outside the Noida Times office for a quick chat about his experiences of performing in the city. The   hitmaker was all praise for the warm and crazy audience of Noida. He told us, "I come to Noida only for work. But I like performing here. The good thing about Noida crowd is that they are crazy. Noida and Haryana crowds aren’t formal like the Delhi ones. They know how to enjoy. At concerts in Delhi, the kids ask for selfies and autographs. Noida mein log haath milaate hain. They will come and shake your hand, hug you. That is much more personal to me. The fans here are willing to take you home after the concert. That’s the kind of warmth you see here."
