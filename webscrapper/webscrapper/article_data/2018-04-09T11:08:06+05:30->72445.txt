Police said that most of the drunk drivers were caught in MG road where the night food court has been routine attraction for people in inebriated state. The number of drunk drivers who are at the wheels of bikes, autos, trucks and cars is increasing steadily.

 “Around 10 per cent of the drunk drivers are being sent to jail. During the last road safety meet with the district collector, we are also seeking to implement the provision of suspending the license of the offenders for a minimum period of three months,” Ramprasad Rao said. 
 
 Last year, almost 300 persons were jailed for drunk driving. Officials pointed that the degree of punishment is decided on the basis of the results acquired from the breath analyser tests. Police said that many of them tend to commit the offence regularly even after being punished.
