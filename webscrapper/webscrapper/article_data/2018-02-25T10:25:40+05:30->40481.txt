VISAKHAPATNAM: If all goes well, work on India’s first   between   and   will commence in 2018, said Bibop  , chairman and co-founder of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, speaking on the sidelines of the   Partnership Summit, on Saturday.

 
 The solar energy-powered transport system that assures to carry 1,64,000 people a day, will cover the 40 km stretch in about six minutes. At present, the time taken to cover this distance (by road) is one hour.
 
 
 The California-based company that signed an MoU with the   government in 2017, for this project, is currently in the process of completing its feasibility study, being conducted in collaboration with a local partner.
 
 
 “The study will not only tell us about the feasibility of the project but also its profitability,” said Gresta assuring the hyperloop transportation system to be more efficient and safer, as it will not be controlled by humans (thus striking out the possibility of human error)
 The study, he said, should be out in a month’s time from now.
 
 
 “Once that is done and if the Chief Minister gives us the go ahead we will be ready to roll out the project,” he said. While he refrained from sharing the projected cost of the venture, he said that building the hyperloop, usually, costs between $15-20 million per kilometre. In Andhra Pradesh, it could take four to five years to finish the project, he added.
 
 
 It is constructing similar projects in France and Abu Dhabi. In India, apart from Andhra Pradesh, the company is also in talks with other state governments including Maharashtra, Telangana, Jharkhand, Goa, Odisha among others to roll out similar projects.
 
 
 Speaking about the potential of India Gresta said: “The country is a prominent market as it has a high population density, lacks infrastructure and needs faster, sustainable and profitable system to carry people from one place to the other.”
