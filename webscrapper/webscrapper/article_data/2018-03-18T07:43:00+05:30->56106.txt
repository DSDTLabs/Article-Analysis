KOLKATA: A species of turtle that is believed to be nearly extinct in the wild and found only in tanks at two locations — Kamakhya temple in Guwahati, Assam and Bayazid Bastami shrine in Chittagong, Bangladesh — has been identified in good numbers at Banerswar, a temple pond in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar.

 Black softshell turtle or Nilssonia nigricans is a critically endangered categorized as Schedule I species in the Wildlife Protection Act. It’s listed in the IUCN Red List as extinct in the wild since 2002. Conservation and management of the species has long been neglected and it has often been misidentified as Nilssonia Hurum, commonly known as Peacock shell turtle.
 
 Hunted extensively for its meat and cartilage, the turtle that was once found in abundance along the Brahmaputra flood plains has dwindled in numbers and is now rarely spotted in the wild.
 
 The turtle that inhabited the pond in Cooch Behar’s Banerswar temple was known as  , another name for Lord Vishnu and revered in the avatar of Kurma, a turtle. That name had stuck. Even records at Zoological Survey of India and state biodiversity board listed it as Peacock shell turtle.
 
 A study by three NGOs — PUBLIC (People United for Better Living in Cities), Human & Environment Alliance League (HEAL) and Society for Protection of Ophiofauna & Animal Rights (SPOAR) — revealed that the turtle is actually Black softshell species.
 
 Amphibian specialist Indraneil Das from  , who is currently attending an IUCN Redlisting meeting at Singapore, said the population found in Cooch Behar was positively Black softshell turtle.
