HYDERABAD: With   accounting for nearly one-third of the total fatalities recorded year-on-year, traffic cops point to a few localities where pedestrian deaths are commonly witnessed. These include Tank Bund, Banjara Hills,  , Mettuguda and East Marredpally. Traffic cops also identified nearly 80 black spots or ‘accident hotspots’ across the twin cities.

 
  
  
 
 A black spot is a particular location where five or more fatal and non-fatal accidents have been recorded due to various reasons that include road engineering defects such as improper road curvatures, topography such as low gradients, rash and negligent or wrong-side driving low height of the central median.
 
 Among the black spots, a few specific locations identified by traffic cops that record the highest number of pedestrian deaths, include the low or ‘down’ gradient near the TV9 office in Banjara Hills, LV Prasad Marg in Banjara Hills, near Chutneys on Road No 2, Banjara Hills, near   in East Marredpally, Secunderabad and near   in Jubilee Hills.
 
 “In places that witness a lot of pedestrian movement such as Tank Bund, which is visited by many for recreational purposes, and the LV Prasad Eye Institute visited by hundreds of patients daily, a pelican signal is essential to bring down fatalities. Many preventive measures have been taken up near Peddama Temple—signages have been put up and gaps in medians have been filled,” said a traffic cop.
 
 Figures show how the number of pedestrian deaths caused in road mishaps is not dipping across the twin cities—21 deaths were recorded in the first three months of this year while 214 pedestrians were victims of road accidents. Analysis of data shows how pedestrians accounted for over 31per cent of fatalities recorded within Hyderabad limits between January and March, 2018.
