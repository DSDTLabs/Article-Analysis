Ahmedabad: The AMC has lodged an FIR against a firm that had painted advertisements on civic body’s properties in Saraspur-Rakhial wards. While carrying out a routine inspection in the area, the AMC found that one Omkar Academy had painted its advertisements on the compound wall of an EWS housing and a pumping station. Some labourers engaged by the firm were to paint a few advertisements on the AMC pumping station wall too. “In the north and south zones, there is this emerging nuisance of painting advertisements on public properties. We had no other options other than lodging a police case,” said a senior estate officer of AMC’s north zone.
