Ahmedabad: A 35-year-old man was electrocuted on the terrace of his residence near Gota on Saturday morning. Investigators said the victim had gone to clear his terrace of pooled rainwater when the incident took place. This is the second incident of electrocution due to the the rains. On Thursday night, two women were killed by a live wire near their residence at Mehnatpura in Ambawadi.

 Sola police identified the victim in Saturday’s incident as Ratnaram Devasi, 35, who lived at a tenement in Bhagwatinagar on Gota-Ognaj Road. At about 9.30am on Saturday, he went to his terrace as water had collected there. He then came in contact with a live wire and was electrocuted. Devji Desai, a neighbour, saw him in the rain and called the 108 emergency service.
 
 “Devasi was taken to Sola Civil Hospital where he was declared dead at 10.55am. He was a native of Rajasthan working with a local unit. Further investigation is under way,” said an investigator.
 
 On Saturday, a local group at Shramjivinagar in Juna Vadaj held a protest against the precarious condition of electric wiring near their residence. The locals said a disaster like the one in Ambawadi, which claimed two lives, would take place if proper action was not taken.
