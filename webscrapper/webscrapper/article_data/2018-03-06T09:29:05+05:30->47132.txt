PANAJI: Seeking information about tracking devices and emergency buttons in taxis, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday asked the transport department to furnish the number of tourist taxis whose licenses have been renewed and those to whom new licenses have been issued. 

 Rule 125 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules mandates that public service vehicles be fitted with a location-tracking device and one or more emergency buttons.
 
 The high court is hearing a petition by the   seeking direction to the government to implement digital   for tourist taxis. 
 
 The government on Monday told the court an amended expression of interest would be issued for a period of 21 days so new bidders could apply.
