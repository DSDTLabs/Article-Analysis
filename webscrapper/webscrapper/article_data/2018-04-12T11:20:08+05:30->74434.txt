AHMEDABAD: Thirty-year-old   and her lover Allahrakkha Shaikh alias  , had planned the murder of Rehnuma’s husband Zafaullah Khan (40) even before the married couple moved to their new flat in the Millat-e-Ibrahim apartment building near the Fatehwadi canal.

  Senior Vejalpur police officials said that both accused confessed to having wanted to get rid of Zafarullah so they could live together. “Zafarullah had grown suspicious about the 18-month-old relationship between   and Shahrukh. He had warned Rehnuma to stay away from Shahrukh,” added a senior police official.
 
  
 
 
  Police sources said Rehnuma and Shahrukh had met about a week ago. “Rehnuma told Shahrukh that they would be shifting to the new flat on Monday and that night would be the right time to get rid of Zafarullah,” said an investigator.
 
 Investigators said they have enough evidence to prove that Rehnuma and Shahrukh, who lives in Sanklitnagar, were together on the night of the murder. “We have also recovered the murder weapon,” a police official said.
