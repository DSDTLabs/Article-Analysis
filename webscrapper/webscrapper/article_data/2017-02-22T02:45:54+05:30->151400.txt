MUMBAI: Islamic preacher Zakir Naik’s request to questioned on Skype in connection with money-laundering probe may be turned down by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Officials said his physical presence would be required for interrogation.

 Officials said that businessman Vijay Malya and former IPL chairman Lalit Modi had also made similar requests but the ED’s position is that questioning through Skype may not serve any purpose. “There are serious allegations and the presence of suspects is required,” an official said.
 
 The ED is investigating the money-laundering case against Naik and Islamic Research Foundation. The agency suspects that Naik had laundered around Rs 200 crore through bogus companies. Naik is abroad and delaying his return fearing arrest in the case. His lawyer had made a request to the ED, saying Naik was willing to be questioned via Skype. The ED began probing the financial transactions of Naik and his family after Mumbai police’s economic offences wing (EOW) probed the funnelling of Rs 64 crore from Naik’s UAE bank account to various accounts in Mumbai. The EOW in its report mentioned that these transactions were not shown in the income-tax returns.
