It’s been a long wait — almost two years — for  , who is looking out for challenging roles on TV. Interestingly, her absence is not because she has become selective about work. Seems, the actress is getting fewer offers because the industry is abuzz with rumours of her pregnancy. So, these days, Mahhi, who was last seen on ' ', is busy fielding questions on her being in the family way.

 She says, “People are shocked when they meet me in person, because they realise that I am not pregnant. Many people have told me that though they were considering me for their shows, they changed their mind after hearing that I am pregnant. I have wasted a lot of time clarifying that I am not expecting. I don’t know who is spreading these rumours, as they are detrimental for any actor, who is actively looking out for work. I want to tell all the gossipmongers that I am not pregnant. In fact, Jay (husband, actor  ) and I are not planning a baby anytime soon. I am itching to get back to work.”
 
 While Mahhi wants to embrace motherhood, she says that it can wait. For now, she is focussing on work. She says, “Of course, Jay and I would like to have a baby, but not now. There is a time for everything and when the time is right, I will have a baby and be open about it. People won’t have to guess and spread rumours, which they have been doing for the past two years. I am looking at good work and women-centric shows.”
