ISLAMABAD: Security forces and terrorists have both emerged as suspects behind the mysterious disappearance of Pakistan’s civil rights activists, with a fifth liberal voice going missing on Wednesday. All were critical of Pakistan’s military establishment and the militancy plaguing the country.

 Forty-year-old Samar Abbas, president of Civil Progressive Alliance Pakistan (CPAP), is the latest in the list of missing people from Islamabad. Syed Talib Abbas, CPAP’s general secretary, said Abbas had travelled to the capital from Karachi on a business trip. “He was in contact with his family but since Saturday, his family has not heard from him and his phone is switched off,” Talib said.
 
 Interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said the government was working towards recovering the missing activists. “This is not the government policy and it will not be tolerated,” Khan said. Mona Aurangzeb, rights   and a well-known author, told TOI, “Enforced disappearances from the urban educated class of Punjab are an alarming trend. The state is giving the impression that no matter who you are, if you raise voice on any subject that it does not approve of, you are bound to pay the price.”
 
 Others gone missing are Salman Haider, a rights activist, poet and a professor at Rawalpindi’s Fatima Jinnah   University. Bloggers Waqas Goraya and Asim Saeed went missing from Lahore. Ahmad Raza Naseer, an online campaigner and activist, was allegedly seen being picked up from near Lahore.
