GHAZIABAD: A 12-hour long jam ensued along   on Monday, after   stopped over 250 trucks and numerous private buses, and diverted traffic near the   since Sunday midnight in preparation for   rehearsals in Delhi. 

 While truck drivers complained of missing delivery deadlines, miffed office goers said traffic cops could have been better prepared to handle the chaos.
 
 Entry of heavy vehicles was restricted beyond Bhopura border toll plaza towards Seemapuri border, due to R-Day rehearsals at Rajpath, Vijay Chowk, India Gate and the C-hexagon route.
 
 For most truck drivers, it was a long ordeal. “I have been waiting here since 4am. My delivery was scheduled for evening today, but I know I will miss the deadline due to the rehearsals,” said Tilakshiv, a truck driver.
 
 When asked about the traffic management, head constable (traffic) Anuj Kumar, said, “This happens two days before Independence Day and Republic Day every year. It’s not a big deal.”
