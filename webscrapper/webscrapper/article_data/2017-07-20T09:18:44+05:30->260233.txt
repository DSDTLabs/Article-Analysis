BENGALURU:   was once a bone of   in the neighbourhood. However, it has now become much sought-after, albeit in a new avatar. The compost generated from solid waste at four processing plants is in high demand among farmers of Ramanagara, Kolar, Hassan, Tumakuru, Chikkaballapura,  .

 Villagers in the surrounding areas had earlier locked horns with BBMP after the latter tried to dump the city's trash in their midst. However, three months ago, the   (KCDC) tied up with the agriculture department to   of Rs 800 per tonne, much cheaper than other types of manure. KCDC has sold 3,149 tonnes so far.These processing units generate three varieties of compost, of which one (4-mm size) is sought after. The compost of larger granule size (35mm) is supplied for horticultural crops.
 
 
 
 
 Farmers can directly raise a request for the compost through Raitha Samparka Kendras (farmer facilitation centres) in their taluks. “There's a demand for 12,000 tonnes and we managed to supply 3,149. We will generate more compost every day; each processing unit can produce 200 tonnes.Though the city generates 4,000 tonnes of waste every day , the level of segregation is poor. We need only wet waste for compost ing. Better segregation can help in generation of more manure and it will help us meet the increasing demand too,“ said Kenchegowda, chairman, KCDC.
 
 Ramaiah K, a farmer from Magadi, said the compost from KCDC is coming handy. “Long ago, we used to generate compost in our backyards with cow dung and agricultural waste. But over the years, mechanization of agriculture has put an end to such practices. Good quality compost costs Rs 4,000 per tractor load these days. Now, compost generated from waste has come as a boon. Once the request is raised, the compost load is delivered at a designated place close to our village from where we transport it to our fields,“ he added.
