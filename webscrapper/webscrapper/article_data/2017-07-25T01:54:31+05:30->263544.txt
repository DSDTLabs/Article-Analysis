 Police said that this is not the first time Ansari has committed such a crime and he has been making off with valuables from people’s houses after promising them carpentry work at a discounted price. Ansari would steal valuables and leave after telling the victims he is going to get some tools needed for the repairs.
 
 In July first week, Ansari called up at Kapoor’s house and asked if any work needs to be done. The actor was not home and the call was attended by the help. Ansari reached the flat and using the same modus operandi, stole the help’s purse. After a complaint was lodged, DCP (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya formed a team of Khar senior inspector Ramchandra Jadhav, inspector Dinesh Kadam, assistant inspector Pandurang Lonkar and detection staff which arrested Ansari from Kurla. He was identified from the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the housing societies where he had struck. 
 
 The accused would call on random numbers and ask if there was any work, said the police. Dahiya said, “He would usually target women. At many societies where he committed the crime, he can be seen hiding his face to avoid getting caught on CCTV cameras ”
 
 “If the victims would ask how he came to know about the work, he would say the building guard informed him,” said Kadam. Ansari has been sent to police custody till July 26. He has committed similar offences in Khar, Amboli, Bandra, Borivli, Juhu, Santacruz, Versova and Vile Parle.
