WUHAN: The top-seeded combine of Swiss Martina Hingis and Taipei's YungJan Chan rode on the confidence they've gained as a team - seven titles from 13 tournaments - to needle and nudge their way to the title round of the  .   and China's   dug deep and made the title favourites work but lacked the artillery on the day to stop the US Open champions.

 On a heavily overcast afternoon, the roof rolled over, Hingis and Chan came through 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 in 1 hour and 48 minutes. They'll play the unseeded combine of Japan's   and China's   in the final.
 
 “It was a long match for this format. We fought well, returned well, we could've served better. They played well on the big points,” Sania said, giving credit where it was due. “There were quite a few games that went to deuce in the second set that they won. They are the in-form team, playing with a lot of confidence.”
 
 The heavily strapped Peng, who took a medical time out in the opening set, served better in the semifinals than she did on Thursday, but the duo couldn't quite weigh in as a side even with the Indian finding rhythm from the back of the court. Serving to stay in the set at 4-5 in the opening essay, the Chinese player left the court for treatment.
 
 She returned to hold serve without fuss to level at 5-5.Thereafter, in a set in which the teams traded serves like it were an international relations formality, Hingis held for the first time in the match. Her former partner Sania followed suit, the Indian doing well to stave off two set points and push the set into tie-break.
