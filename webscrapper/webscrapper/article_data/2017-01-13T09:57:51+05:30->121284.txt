MYSURU: In a bid to encourage residents to use non-motorized vehicles, the district administration is likely to offer free rides for residents and tourists to make them familiar with “Trin Trin,” the country’s first   (PBS) system, which is ready for launch.

 Deputy commissioner D Randeep on Wednesday said that the pilot project will be launched within a week. “Mysuru has bagged the cleanest city tag twice and now our goal is to make the city environmental-friendly by promoting use of non-motorized vehicles,” he said. 
 
 After inspecting a PBS docking station near RTO office, Randeep, to begin with there will be 30 docking stations and by January end, all the 50 plus stations covering the entire will start functioning. A total of 450 bicycles will be available for public and visitors. 
 
 All important landmarks, tourist places, railway station, bus stands and public offices have been linked by setting up docking stations. A user can hire a bicycle at one station and leave it at any docking station across Mysuru. 
 
 ‘TrinTrin’ is a state government project, partially funded by World Bank under its Global Environment Facility Grant. The project is being implemented by the directorate of urban land transport and Mysuru City Corporation. Bicycles are owned by MCC but the project will be implemented and operated by Green Wheel Ride, a Mysuru-based manufacturer of eco-friendly bicycles.
