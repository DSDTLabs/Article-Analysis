CHANDIGARH: Within an hour of conveying   to Haryana chief minister   on Friday, senior Congress leader and former CM   lambasted the government for serious lapses in   which according to him could draw its nemesis. 

 Interacting with newspersons here, Hooda accused the   of forced closure of state-run power projects while surrendering Haryana’s share in other centrally-sponsored electricity generation projects in the state. “This government has given up its share in Jharli and other projects at a time when farmers are asking for water and electricity for their parched fields. 
 
 He said till 2005, governments fell on the issue of electricity. “We did not allow this to happen between 2005 and 2014. Now this will again be an an issue,” said Hooda accusing the government of indulging in vindictive politics. “Instead of registering false cases, this government should have concern for employees, law and order, development projects and people-oriented politics,” said the ex-CM.
