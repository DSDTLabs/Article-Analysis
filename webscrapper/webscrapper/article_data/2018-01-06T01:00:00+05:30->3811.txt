Vikram Bhatt’s new horror '1921' with Zareen Khan and Karan Kundrra, has five songs. While four songs have been composed and penned by Harish Sagane and Shakeel Azmi, there’s one song that has Asad Khan and Raqueeb Alam featuring as composer and lyricist. 
 
 The first three songs — 'Sunn Le Zara, Kuch Iss Tarah and Yaara' seemed to belong to the same family of soft love tracks with a haunting, strain to it. Newbie singer   does a commendable job in all three. The pathos, longing and intensity of these tracks is reminiscent of Bhatt’s earlier films like '1920', '1920-Evil Returns' and '1920-London'.
 
  The fourth track 'Tere Bina', a duet by   and composed by Asad, has nothing new to offer. 'Aanewale Kal', on the other hand, introduces us Rahul Jain, another promising singer. The album also offers four themes titled: 'Aggressive Piano Theme', 'Main Piano Theme', 'Crowd Gathering' and 'Piano Theme'.
