NAVI MUMBAI: While urban voters played a decisive role, mostly supporting BJP to post an impressive victory in the maiden  , a major chunk of rural and semi-urban voters preferred not to switch side in most parts and remained loyal to the local   (BSKP).

 “Despite low voting in cosmopolitan Kharghar with 41, 41 and 50% voting recorded respectively in three wards, people voted for BJP on stability and development agenda,” said Ashok More, a resident. Kamothe’s cosmopolitan voters swung side to BJP where it won 9 seats of 11 while BSKP managed 2 seats from the erstwhile grampanhayat pockets.
 
 In Panvel’s rural and semi-urban pockets the BSKP loyalists did not change side and stuck to their old party. In the city BJP created strong impact with urban voters. New Panvel, a conglomerate of urban voters, after the CM’s rally a huge swing was seen which reflected in BJP winning 15 seats of 16 from four multi-seat wards. Kalamboli was the only node where BSKP and its allies remained unbeaten as BJP had to face strong challenges here.
 
 Cosmopolitan voters, who recently migrated to Navi Mumbai, feel disconnected from local leaders as they believe that they did nothing to improve civic amenities. Their expectations are high and local leaders and activists failed to live up to it.
 
 Issues that matter to voter are quite contrasting in rural and urban pockets. While cosmopolitan residents expect hassle free basic civic amenities, rural folks are content with the proximity to their leaders.   do not mind if there is lack of continuous power supply or uneven roads, but expect their leaders to be there as moral support during crisis.
 
 There was a split between rural and urban voters, when five Cidco nodes and Taloja industrial area amalgamated with PCMC, BJP was well aware that its strength was in the urban voter.
