MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday refused any relief for a south Mumbai couple seeking to   to represent them in   initiated against them by   in  . 

 The disciplinary proceedings was initiated following a sexual harassment complaint against the husband of a woman member by a fellow member. Justice Suresh Gupte dismissed the couple’s application, saying, “There is clearly no prima facie merit in the case either that the rule (barring legal representation) is bad in law and inoperative or that it must be necessarily so read as to allow a discretion to the committee to allow legal representation in an appropriate case.” 
 
 The couple’s lawyer had contended that the club’s rule which prohibits any legal representation to a member who is facing a disciplinary inquiry, was against the rules of natural justice. They also argued that the club’s balloting and disciplinary committee comprises some senior lawyers.
 
 The court said the fact that the panel consists of lawyers may be a matter of coincidence. “Whether or not it is a coincidence, that does not mean that fair play is being denied to the (couple) by avoiding legal representation,” said Justice Gupte. “This is not an inquiry where the (couple) and the club are adversaries. It is really a disciplinary inquiry initiated by the club on a complaint by a fellow member. The (dispute) is between two members, where the balloting and disciplinary committee is really in the position of judges. If the judges were to include a legally trained mind as part of them, so be it. That does not mean that the tribunal is any worse, for that reason, than the tribunal of mere laymen.” 
 
 The committee had issued a notice to the couple in the disciplinary inquiry following the complaint received by the club earlier this year. The couple challenged the legality of the club rules which say, “no member shall have the right to be represented by an advocate or a representative at any disciplinary proceedings.”
