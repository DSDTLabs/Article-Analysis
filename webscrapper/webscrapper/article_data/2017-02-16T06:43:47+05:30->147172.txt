HYDERABAD: Justice A   of the high court on Tuesday questioned  's move to take possession of certain assets of YS Jaganmohan Reddy's firms like   under the provisions of the Prevention of   Act (PMLA) despite a restraint order from both the HC and the appellate authority. The ED is proceeding under the Act after the adjudicating authority confirmed its attachment orders passed in Bharati Cements case.

 The judge was dealing with petitions filed by YS Bharati, Harish Infra, Utopia Infra, Capstone Infra, Silicon Builders, Revan Infra, Classic Realty and Bhagavath Sannidhi real estate challenging the ED's possession notice.The agency's counsel PSP Suresh Kumar said that they were not violating the order of the court and that they were only trying to take symbolic possession of the assets. The HC order, which restrained us from taking physical possession, in fact allowed us to complete these formalities, he added. The judge sought to know from him whether the ED can do this when the restraint order is in operation till March10. “You are now trying to make a distinction between actual and symbolic possessions,“ the judge said.
 
 The judge sought a counter from the ED and posted the case to next Wednesday.
