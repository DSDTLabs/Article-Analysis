TUTICORIN: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday petitioned the   collector N Venkatesh to remove all hoardings that have been erected by Sterlite across the district. “If the collector does not order their removal we will remove them on the 15th day from today (April 2),” state convenor of AAP, S A N   said.

 Talking to reporters while taking part in the protest at Kumarattiyapuram after petitioning the collector, Vaseegaran said the hoardings should be removed to respect the sentiments of the people who are opposing the company. “Advertisement boards bearing the name Sterlite have been erected everywhere in the district including the collectorate,” he said.
 
 He added that his party functionaries and social activists who accompanied him, identified hundreds of places where the company has erected its banners to publicise the work they had carried out under their corporate social responsibility. “They have erected the banners prominently even for planting trees,” he claimed.
 
 Noting that the company has put up its banners at the collectorate, corporation parks, 78 schools and various institutions, Vaseegaran said the collector was unable to give a commitment on removing the boards in the collectorate. “If he cannot remove them, how is he going to close the polluting copper producing giant?” he asked.
 
 One of the activists V   claimed that   and the district administration also obtained sponsorships from Sterlite and that it should not be entertained. He further claimed that the copper manufacturer also heavily funds a good number of NGOs and organisations in the district.
