Porvorim: To fulfil his aim of making Goa garbage-free by 2020 and having an integrated approach to waste management, chief minister   has proposed three more solid waste treatment plants at Cacora, Bainguinim and the Verna industrial estate, on the lines of the one at Saligao.

 In his budget for the 2017-18 fiscal, Parrikar has earmarked Rs 11,600 lakh for comprehensive  , with Rs 7,700 lakh for establishment of transfer stations and roadside garbage collection across national and state highways and major district roads.
 
  The collection of waste from around 100 panchayat areas and education programmes on garbage management will also be covered.
 
 In the new financial year, the government proposes to undertake work on Goa’s second integrated waste treatment plant together with a transfer station at Cacora, on a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) basis. The compost generated will be used as manure by the forest and agriculture departments.
 
 “This (plant at Cacora) will boost segregation and waste collection efforts in the Quepem and Sanguem talukas, and alleviate issues of indiscriminate dumping at many places,” Parrikar said in the assembly on Friday.
 
 The government also plans to clear the dump at Sonsoddo, Margao, through remediation under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. The  , which was formed recently, will become fully functional by June to tackle the state’s waste management issues.
 
 Goa’s burgeoning garbage problem has earned the state a bad reputation internationally. The Saligao plant, which has aimed to treat waste in the coastal areas of Bardez, has partly succeeded in drawing garbage from many villages. But the major hurdle is that segregated waste forms only a small component of the garbage received at the plant. Lack of cooperation from stakeholders to segregate at source, a basic requirement of waste management, has been hampering the functioning of the plant.
