LUDHIANA: The ongoing tussle between the residents of EWS colony and officials of the   (GLADA) on   did not end even on Thursday despite area MLA Sanjay   intervening in the matter. The GLADA officials would start the installation of a   to solve the problem of garbage dump in the locality, but the area residents are opposing the move saying that this would increase the movement of garbage lifting vehicles in the area leading to accidents.

 The residents have been protesting against the authorities for the past three days and on Wednesday, the GLADA officials could not begin the process due to residentsâ€™ protest despite the presence of cops. However on Thursday, GLADA officials and residents were called for a meeting by Talwar so that the matter could be resolved. But residents are not ready to budge and continued their protest against the static compactor installation.
 
 The residents claimed there are small children in the area who play in the park adjoining the static compactor site and once it is installed, garbage lifting vehicles will be moving here which can lead to accidents. Moreover, they rued that the park has been developed recently and due to the dump, even this park will be damaged. The residents said officials can install this static compactor in the vacant land at the Tajpur Road dairy complex which is nearby. 
 
 Meanwhile Talwar said he tried to convince the public that it was for their benefit that garbage lying in open would be covered in the static compactor and there would be no foul smell as well but the residents were not paying any heed to him. He said he had asked the residents to form a committee which could represent their demands for further decision. 
 
 The GLADA officials claimed they tried to convince the residents and also told them that static compactor would not create any problem like foul smell or filth but they are not ready to listen anything.
