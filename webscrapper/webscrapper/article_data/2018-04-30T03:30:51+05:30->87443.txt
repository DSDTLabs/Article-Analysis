GURUGRAM: Power transmission company Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN) has operationalised the key 66kV Jamalpur  , whose work was left halfway in 2017 after the company to which it was outsourced was blacklisted internationally. The total cost of the project was Rs 16 crore,   officials said. 

 Officials said HVPN decided to gradually complete the work on their own. “Had we decided to outsource the process again, we would have to go through the entire process from scratch, which would have taken us another year and a half,” said Anil Yadav, superintendent engineer, HVPN. 
 
 “On the other hand, we had over 9,000 consumers who were facing problems of inadequate  ,” Yadav added.
 
 “The company,  , which was overseeing the work, was blacklisted internationally for certain reasons. So instead of re-awarding another contract, our men took it upon themselves to finish it. We first identified a nearby 200kV line. But due to its high voltage, it had to be stepped down to 66kV, after which we started the construction,” he said.
 
 Officials said the new substation will cater to villages in Gurugram, namely Jamalpur, Ghosgarh, Khumbawas, Baslambi, Tatarpur, Kharkhari, Chitrasen and Prem Nagar.
 
 This is the second time that HVPN had to build a substation on its own after the same contractor left work midway. 
 
 Recently, the transmission company operationalised a gas insulated substation in Sector 57. This substation was built to supply power to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) lines that extended into the city and the Rapid Metro.
