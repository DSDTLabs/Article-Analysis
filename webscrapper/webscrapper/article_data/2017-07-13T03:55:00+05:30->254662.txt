Panaji: The Malabar pit viper, one of the country’s most intriguing snakes, will have a national-level photography exhibition dedicated to it this week; the first of its kind to be held on a single endemic venomous snake in India. 

 Titled ‘Malabar Pit Viper Wonder of the Western Ghats’, the exhibition will be held from Friday to Sunday at the state department of art and culture, Sanskruti Bhavan, Patto, Panaji.
 
 Photographs capturing various facets of the nocturnal snake that is commonly encountered during the monsoon in southern and western India, have been contributed by 35 renowned wildlife photographers and researchers from across the country and the world. 
 
 The exhibition has been dedicated to the late Goan toxicologist, Ramesh Kankonkar, who made significant contributions in the development of Russell’s viper anti-venom and black scorpion anti-toxin. Kankonkar also served as the assistant director of Mumbai’s Haffkine Institute, one of the oldest biomedical research institutes in the country.
 
 “The Malabar pit viper, whose scientific name is Trimeresurus malabricus, is endemic to the Western Ghats. Very little is known about the potency of its venom and its behaviour. This species has an array of over eight colour morphs, which provides excellent scope for photography,” herpetologist and wildlife photographer Nirmal Kulkarni told TOI.
 
 Photographs on display at the exhibition will be available for sale. Part of the proceeds will go towards the Pit Viper Conservation Fund.
