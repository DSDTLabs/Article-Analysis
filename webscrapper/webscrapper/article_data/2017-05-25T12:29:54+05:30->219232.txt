NASHIK: Stress, lack of support or understanding within a family and demential are some of the common factors in most missing persons cases, city-based psychiatrists have said. 

 While this may not be true for children below the age of 12 often influenced by someone, after which they go missing, lack of understanding or support from family is the main reason for people leaving their house in other cases.
 
 Dhake added that while falling in love was one factor for those in the demographic of 15-25 years, people in this age group often feel that they were being overlooked by their family members and so they left their homes. 
 
 For others in the age group of 25-65 years, stress was one of the main reasons for leaving home. "Mid-life crisis was the major issue for missing persons from this age bracket. While everything is going smoothly, all of a sudden there is some or the other crisis related to their   or family. In such cases, they simply leave everything behind," Dhake said.
 
 Those above the age of 65 years, leave their homes as they feel neglected by their own family members. Dementia, an ailment related to forgetting, also is an important factor making them leave home, Dhake said. Those suffering from dementia are not able to remember anything and if they happen to go outside their house, they simply cannot remember the way back.
