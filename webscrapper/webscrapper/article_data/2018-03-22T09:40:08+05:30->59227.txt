HYDERABAD: Telangana Congress leaders led by TPCC Election Commission Coordination Committee chairman, Marri  , and expelled MLAs Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and SA Sampath Kumar met Chief Election Commissioner OP   and submitted two representations.

 In the first representation, they urged the CEC to restore the names of expelled MLAs in the voting list for Rajya Sabha polls and take stringent action against   Secretary who is the Returning Officer for the elections.
 
 In a press release, Shashidhar Reddy said after listening patiently to the submissions made to him,   assured that a decision will be taken before the Rajya Sabha polls scheduled for March 23.
 
 In the second representation, the Congress delegation urged that the   should take stringent steps to prevent blatant misuse of power to subvert democracy and disturb its very foundations. The delegation alleged that in 2015, following the instructions of Telangana chief minister  , the officials tried to delete lakhs of names from the voters list in Hyderabad.
 
 “Now they have devised a dubious method for deletion of names from the MLAs list by expelling them. This should not become the new norm in India that whenever there is RS polls, ruling party expels MLAs to clear the decks for their victory. EC has enormous powers, both plenary and residuary under Art 324 on Constitution,” the representation read.
 
 The representation added that EC should take stringent steps to prevent misuse of power by ruling party by resorting to illegal, unconstitutional methods for electoral gains. Peoples’ faith in EC and democracy cannot be eroded.
 
 In the past there were instances of postponement — at the time of Rajiv Gandhi assassination, countermanding   election in 2012 and RK Puram Assembly (Tamil Nadu) bye-election in 2017 because of seizure of huge amount of cash.
