New Delhi: A day after the daring robbery in a bus carrying   guests, police busted a Sangam Vihar-based gang of dacoits and arrested   persons on Tuesday.

 The accused had planned and executed the heist based on a movie script. The mastermind, Raj Kumar, who plied an autorickshaw in south Delhi had lent out his vehicle for the crime and instructed the men from a distance while they intercepted, waylaid and robbed the wedding guests.
 
 Later, in order to mislead the police, Kumar asked his wife to call the PCR and inform them about the theft of his auto. However, police traced the auto and seized it.
 
 Raj Kumar had roped in six other criminals -- Manish, Maan Singh, Karambeer, Kuldeep, Vipin and Azmal -- for job and designated a role to each of them. 
 
 Two of them were asked to track the bus carrying the wedding guests from  , while the others were asked to create diversions. Three of the accused boarded the bus and knocked out the driver, before robbing the passengers. While they were fleeing, one of the women passengers noted down the registration number of the auto, which helped the police in tracing it.
 
 “A team was formed under SHO, Neb Sarai, Kuldeep Singh formed to track the auto when we received a call about a stolen auto with the same registration number as the one used in the crime,” said Ishwar Singh, DCP, south.
 
 A manhunt was launched during which it was found that two men had reached a south Delhi court to seek an anticipatory bail. “The two accused were   before they could reach the court. During interrogation they admitted their involvement in the crime. The others were tracked down at their behest,”said Chinmoy Biswal, additional DCP, south.
 
 Later, Kumar told police that he had received a tip-off about the bus returning from Swaroop Nagar area with wedding guests. 
 
 A case of dacoity has been registered against the accused and a probe is on to recover the robbed items.
