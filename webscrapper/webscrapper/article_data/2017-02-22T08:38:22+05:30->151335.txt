MADURAI: A PIL has been filed at the Madras   Madurai bench seeking a direction to the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly speaker and the assembly secretary to hold a   by adopting secret ballot system. T Analagan, son of former MLA R Thamaraikani, has filed the PIL.

 He said on February 18, ‘floor test’ took place in the assembly for   to prove his majority. But, no secret ballot system was followed.
 
 Many MLAs were under alleged illegal detention for more than 10 days in a private resort in Koovathur near Chennai. Due to this, they lost their independence and were unable to take a decision on their own. They should have got an opinion from people in the respective constituencies to know whether Palaniswami was their choice, the petitioner said.
 
 Besides, the Supreme Court has held the view of the populace in a democracy could be ascertained only through voting by secret ballot. The apex court also said that citizens are enabled to take part in the government through their representatives and the elected representative acts or is supposed to act as a live link between the people and the government, the petitioner said.
 
 He also said that even in the panchayat election secret ballot is in vogue. Hence, it was necessary to issue a direction to conduct   afresh by adopting secret ballot system, the petitioner said.
