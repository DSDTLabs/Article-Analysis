NEW DELHI: Parts of the city witnessed   jams on Tuesday morning due to the   and extensive checking of vehicles heading towards Lutyens’ Delhi. Police sources said that Mathura Road and Ring Road remained barricaded even during the day.

 The diversions put in place at 8am led to snarls as motorists moved towards Ring Road and Outer Ring Road. The traffic   extended to NH-24 and roads from Ghaziabad and Noida as the volume of vehicles on Ring Road from Sarai Kale Khan to Rajghat went up significantly.
 
 
  
 The slow movement of traffic is likely to continue for the next two days, police said. Those travelling from Vikas Marg towards New Delhi railway station have been advised to take Mathura Road or Barapullah. Police expect Mother Teresa Crescent, RML and Baba Kharak Singh Marg to be relatively snarl-free. “Our aim is to synchronise the movement of traffic so that it does not come to a complete halt,” said a traffic police officer.
 
 
  
 
 Rashtrapati Bhavan, Pandara Road, Motilal Nehru Marg, Sher Shah Road, Purana Qila Road, Copernicus Marg, Kasturba Gandhi Marg and Ashoka Road will be turned into restricted zones on Wednesday and Thursday. Those travelling by Metro will not be allowed to board or de-board at Central Secretariat and Udyog Bhawan stations from 5am and at Race Course and Patel Chowk stations from 8.45am on both days.
 
 “Commuters moving between south and north Delhi should take either the Ring Road stretch connecting Sarai Kale Khan and Kashmere Gate or the route from Sardar Patel Marg to Rani Jhansi Road passing through Mother Teresa Crescent and Mandir Marg,” said a police officer.
 
 On Wednesday, small stretches of Rafi Marg, Janpath and Man Singh Road will also be blocked as leaders of Asean countries would start arriving in the city for the summit on January 25.
