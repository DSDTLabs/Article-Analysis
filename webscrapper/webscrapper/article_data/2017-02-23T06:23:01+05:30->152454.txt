PILIBHIT: A day after a six-year-old boy was allegedly   and the body was   by a  ,  , in Amaria tehsil of  , nearly a thousand local residents came out to the street on Wednesday to protest against the murder and demanded capital punishment for the killer. The markets also remained closed on Wednesday. The protesters submitted a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) demanding that a drive be launched to curb the menace of drugs addiction in the area. Meanwhile, personnel from two police stations were deployed to avert any untoward incident, keeping in mind the prevailing tension in the area.
 
  Though people are comparing Tuesday's incident to that of the horrific Nithari serial killings of children case of 2006, in which the accused also ate human flesh, Amari police said they were yet to establish the motive behind the murder. Additional superintendent of police (ASP) Ram Suresh Yadav said the killer was not cooperating with the police and that the motive could not be established yet. The ASP said the accused was not even able to understand or answer simple questions during interrogation. The reason could be that he is still under the influence of drugs or he is playing a trick, Yadav added.
  
  Bheem Sen Patel, officiating SHO at Amaria police station, said the postmortem report could not confirm sodomy, as alleged by the boy's family, since the accused had cut the body into pieces. He said that the alleged killer was sent to jail on Wednesday and that there was no intention to take him in police remand.
  
  "Locals said that the accused's father, Tabussar Ali, is a poor plumber and alleged that he is also a drug addict. The locals claimed that the accused was unemployed and was dependent on his father," said the officiating SHO adding that there was no grave criminal record againstNazim, though there were several complaints of selling household goods against him.
