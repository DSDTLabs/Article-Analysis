PUNE: Olympians from  , who had represented the country at the   last year, are still waiting for the cash awards announced by chief minister  .. 

 The CM in September last had announced a cash prize of Rs75 lakh for athlete  , who finished a creditable 10th in the women’s steeplechase final.
 
 Apart from this, Fadnavis had also announced a cash prize of Rs50 lakh each to rower Datu Bhokanal, tennis player Prarthana Thombare and long-distance runner  . 
 
 In reply to a text message regarding this, Fadnavis directed the query to sports minister Vinod Tawde, who said legislative sanction was needed to release the money from the state’s coffers. “The government cannot spend money before getting a sanction from the state legislature. Once we get the sanction, the money will be disbursed to the Olympians,” Tawde said, without committing to a time frame. 
 
 Babar, who is currently training for the World Championships at a national camp in Bangalore, told TOI she is disappointed with the delay, and that she would like to build a personal fitness centre with the money. “In December, I had contacted the state government but got no positive response. I could not pursue the matter again as I had to join the camp. If I get the money, I can set up my own gym and can continue my fitness training whenever I’m home,” said Babar, who hails from Mohi village in Satara district.
