BENGALURU: Residents of Kanakapura Road and nearby areas will have reason to cheer next year. Namma Metro's Reach-4B extension -from Yelachenahalli to   Station -will be functional by 2018-end, Bengaluru development minister   said on Friday.After inspecting ongoing work on the corridor, George said: “We have asked the contractor, NCC Limited, to complete civil work on Reach-4B by March 2018. Track-laying will be completed and the stretch will be ready for operation by December 2018."

 Part of Metro Phase II, the elevated 6.29km southern extension of the Green Line will have five stations -Anjanapura Cross Road, Krishna Leela Park, Vajrahalli, Thalghattapura and Anjanapura Township (Nice Junction).
 
 
 
 
 Initially, BMRC proposed to acquire 15 acres of land in the reserve forest of Uttarahalli, Manavarthe Kaval to build a Metro depot for maintenance and other work, next to an elephant corridor between Ban nerghatta and Savandurga.“We have now decided to acquire only two acres of forest land for the approach route to the depot, which will be located on private land. The forest department has given in-principle approval," said George.
 
 BMRC managing director Pradeep Singh Kharola said: “The proposed depot at Anjanapura will be mainly used to park trains."
 
 George said several private companies have evinced interest in adopting stations.“Embassy Group and Bagmane have already committed to adopt a Metro station each on the proposed Central Silk Board-KR Puram line.   is keen on adopting one on the RV   line,“ he said.
 
 
 
 
 Metro work on Kanakapura Road has caused severe traffic congestion in the area during peak hours and shrunk the road width. Residents want an underpass at Konanakunte Cross to connect Vasanthapura and Anjanapura. “We are facing heavy traffic congestion at Konanakunte Cross. An underpass will be of much help," said Krishnappa S, a regular commuter on the route.
