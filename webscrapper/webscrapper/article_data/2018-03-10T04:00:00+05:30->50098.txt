Chennai: US-based Ljungstrom on Friday inaugurated a manufacturing facility in Chennai which will be used to meet its Indian and export requirements. The company, which manufactures equipment for thermal power plants across the globe, has invested $7million in the new plant that has a production capacity of 16,000 metric tons per annum. This is Ljungstrom’s seventh factory globally. Spread across three acres and 55,000 sq. ft. of covered area, the facility will produce equipment to support thermal plants in their effort to meet emission norms. “Despite the shift towards renewable energy, we see a lot opportunity in India. Substantial portion of our revenues come from servicing the equipment which will continue to grow,” said Dave Breckinridge, president, Ljungstrom. “Also, a lot of investment is going towards modernisation of existing plants to meet new norms. Our patented technologies are designed to enhance efficiency as always improve emission control,” said Dave Breckinridge, president, Ljungstrom. The company is in discussions with clients in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and South Africa for contracts that will be fulfilled from the Chennai facility. The company is expecting to clock revenues of close to Rs 100 crore for 2017-18. “We saw a 60% CAGR last year with a 150% growth in the order book which now stands at Rs 250 crore,” said Pankaj Chopra, MD, Ljungstrom India. Among its various wins last year is a contract for the supply of air preheaters and gas-gas heaters for the Obra-C coal-fired electrical power plant in Sonebhadra district, and for the Jawaharpur coal-fired electrical power plant in Etah district, both in Uttar Pradesh. Project execution will be led by Ljungstrom’s India operations and critical elements of the equipment will be manufactured in the Chennai factory.
