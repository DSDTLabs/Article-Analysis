AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Thursday sent  , chairman of   and  , and  , managing director (MD) of the companies, to police custody for three days, in connection with an alleged Rs 500 crore cheating case, where more than 10,000 persons across the state were duped. The duo was arrested on Wednesday and produced before the court. Police had applied for 14-day remand to interrogate them about the offence.

 The economic offences wing (EOW) of CID (crime) had last November started investigating the dealings of the two companies which were floated between 2011 and 2014, based in   and Ahmedabad. The companies allegedly promised to double invested money in 30 months. Agents were promised a plot free on the purchase of a plot. A chain of commission agents were promised between 35% and 37% commissions on investments they brought, says the complaint filed by the agency.
 
 A A Saiyad, DSP, CID (crime), told the court said that the couple is yet to be interrogated about their investments using the money gained from the alleged cheating. The agency submitted that they need to know if the accused are involved in similar offence in other states. The probe agency is yet to confiscate audit reports, balance sheets and account books of the companies, which have been hidden by the accused, CIDâ€™s plea said.
