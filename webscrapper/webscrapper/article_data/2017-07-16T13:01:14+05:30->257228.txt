Alwar: The   and Dholpur on Saturday served an ultimatum to the government to decide on their demand for reservation under OBC by July 31 or they threatened to re-start their agitation.

 The community members gathered at the traffic junction in Bharatpur on Saturday under Dhlopur-Bharatpur Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti convener Nem Singh Fogdar and raised slogans against the government.
 
 They alleged that as per the written agreement with the government on June 24, the state government had guaranteed that the proposal would be placed in the cabinet at the earliest and a decision would be taken in their favour. But the government so far has not called any cabinet meeting. They alleged that the government is adopting delay tactics by avoiding the meeting of the cabinet.
 
 Fogdar alleged that government is deliberately avoiding calling the cabinet meeting.
 
 It shows that the government is not inclined to grant reservation to the Jats of these two districts. He warned that the people will be forced to relaunch their agitation if the government continues to delay its decision. The government would be fully responsible for the consequences, he added.
 
 He said the sangharsh samiti had handed over a memorandum to the minister incharge of Bharatpur district that if the government fails to call the cabinet meeting before July 14, on July 15 the sangharsh samiti will outline the road map for agitation.
 
 He said MLA Vishvendra Singh would take the final decision on the agitation. 
 
 Now, a campaign has been launched in the villages to mobilise people to create awareness for an agitation.
 
 It may be noted that Jats, except for those from Bharatpur and Dholpur, are covered under the OBC reservation.
