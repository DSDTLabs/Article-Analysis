PUNE: The city-based   (ARAI) unveiled   it developed indigenously , in  .

 On the closing day of the Symposium for   , a video was played, showing a small,   on a test track. It performs functions like overtaking a stationary car, moving on a smooth road and turning left and right.
 
 A team of about 20 people from ARAI and Cognizant we re involved in the project.
 
 There is debate in the auto industry on whether autonomous cars are wise in India, given the chaotic traffic on the country's roads. Recently , Maruti Suzuki chairman R C Bhargava was quoted as saying, “Driverless cars will not work in India.“
 
 Senior ARAI officials are of the opinion that initially , this technology can be used to assist night-driving, at certain speeds on select corridors, and can potentially cut down on the number of road accidents.
 
 “We believe it will be much safer (when the technology matures), as the sensors fixed on the car can sense 360 degrees, and farther than the hu man eye,“ said Mangesh Saraf, deputy director of ARAI.
 
 “Autonomous vehicles need are not just driverless vehicles, but also as driver-assisted vehicles with better reaction and intelligence,“ he added.
 
 Pawan Goenka, managing director of Mahindra & Mahindra (M & M), chimed in recently that technology can initially be tested in tractors on farms, as there is little risk of accidents there. M & M is reportedly working on an autonomous prototype tractor for the purpose.
 
 In six months, ARAI aims to test these vehicles with more vehicles around to simulate real road conditions.
