NEW DELHI: The father of Maldivian blogger  , murdered recently in capital Male, is in India looking for the government’s support in containing the growing radicalisation of the island-nation.

 Weeks after Rasheed’s brutal murder, police have arrested seven people suspected of executing the killing. But sources tracking the case in Maldives say there is little interest in going deeper into the cause of the murder. Yameen isn’t the only blogger in the island nation to have suffered a terrible fate. In 2014, his friend, Ahmed Rilwan, was abducted and his whereabouts remain unknown till today.
 
 Yameen decided to pursue that case. His death happened at the same place from where his friend had been picked up. “There is growing radicalisation in the vicinity of India. India should help,” says Hussain Rasheed, Yameen’s father.
 
 Yameen was born in the Maldives but his father brought all four children for their education to India. Yameen went to school in Kerala and trained as an IT professional in Bangalore. Speaking to TOI, Hussain Rasheed says Yameen could have been inspired by talks of injustice he heard from his father. He went back to Maldives, started a school to teach English, and developed a social service app that won a 20,000 euro award. He had a girlfriend in Brussels.
 
 But his writings on matters social and political attracted the wrong kind of attention in acountry which is radicalising at an alarming rate. Saudi Arabia has been providing the funds and ideology, growing numbers of Maldivians are going to Pakistan to study at madrassas there and even take scholarships to Medina university in Saudi Arabia, thereby being suffused with Wahabi/Salafi ideologies. Maldives also has the dubious distinction of having the highest per capita enrolment in Islamic State.
 
 Hussain Rasheed himself is associated with former President Mohamed Nasheed’s party, MDP, and while Yameen was not politically active, he was opposed to the growing conservatism at home.
