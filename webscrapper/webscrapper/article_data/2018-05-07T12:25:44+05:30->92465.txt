TIRUNELVELI: Unlike last year when the confusion over the admission process hampered their performance, MBBS aspirants from government and aided schools were generally satisfied with their performance in national eligibility-cum-entrance test this time. Many owed their confidence to the coaching classes offered by the school education department where they had been used to writing multiple tests over the last few weeks. 

 Most students found the biology questions easy while physics and chemistry were tough. A Renusha, 17, a government aided school student from Sathankulam in   district, attended the coaching conducted by the department from December and month-long classes at   last month. “Some of the questions asked in   were similar to the ones we learned in the coaching classes,” she said and added that most of the questions were a little twisted. I Kulasipoongothai, 18, a Tamil medium government school student from   in  , said that around 15 questions she faced were the ones she had come across in tests conducted in the government coaching centre. “Though the test is based on CBSE syllabus and was tough, I answered these familiar questions positively,” she said.
