Ahmedabad: The education department has decided that the summer vacation will now begin from May 7 instead of May 1. Similarly, the schools will reopen after the vacation from June 10 instead of June 4.

 The decision has come under criticism as the teachers and parents say that it would upset their vacation plans. 
 
 On Tuesday, the Gujarat University in a notification which was sent to all district education officers and schools affiliated with the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Board passed the instructions making changes in the vacation.
 
 The teachers and the non-teaching staff are planning to lodge a protest as the decision will upset their vacation plans. Mohit Patel, a teacher, said that he had planned a trip to Himachal Pradesh but the decision will force him to either apply for leave or cancel his trip. Getting tickets for the flight at the last moment would be expensive. “I had booked tickets in February at a very cheap price but today when I checked, the same have doubled.”
 
 Sughnaben Shah, a parent, said, “I will have to ask one of my relatives to go to the school and collect the result. The government should announce changes in advance as the last-minute announcement would force teachers and parents to alter their plans. There are around 10,000 primary and secondary schools in the state.
