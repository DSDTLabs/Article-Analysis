JAIPUR: Instead of the long-sought demand to reduce duty on imports of gold, diamond and coloured stone, the finance minister has further burdened the jewellers and coloured stone traders in the Pink City by increasing the rates.

 In his budget announcement, the FM said cut and polished coloured gemstones, diamonds (including lab-grown, semi-processed, half-cut or broken diamonds), non-industrial diamonds (including lab-grown diamonds other than rough diamonds) will be levied a duty of 5%.
 
 Rajeev Jain, former chairman of the  , said that the industry had never expected a decision like this.
 
 “We have been demanding a reduction in duty on gold imports. But instead of reducing, the budget further burdened the sector by levying a cess of 0.3%. Similarly, the duty on coloured stone and diamonds has been proposed to be raised from 2.5% to 5%,” said Jain.
 
 Ajay Kala, another prominent jeweller in the city, said as per the budget proposals, imitation jewellery would now be charged 20% instead of 15%.
 
 Rajasthan is the hub for coloured stones and much of it is exported.
 
 Jain said the city traders were competing with countries like Thailand, China, Hong Kong and Japan where the interest rates were low and the industry enjoyed other facilities.
 
 “Our products will be rendered uncompetitive with such additional tax burden. We already work in a high cost scenario as the interest rates are high. This decision will not go down well with the industry,” added Jain.
