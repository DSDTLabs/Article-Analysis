TRICHY: Urging the state government to put pressure on the Union government to secure Tamil Naduâ€™s share of   water, farmers associations have decided to stage a rail roko across the five delta districts on January 27.

 After a meeting held in   on Wednesday, the state general secretary of   Farmers Association, Shanmugam said that it was decided that rail roko would be held in Trichy, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and   to condemn the   chief minister's statement rejecting the Tamil Nadu chief minister's appeal to release water in Cauvery. The water release would save standing samba paddy crop being cultivated in around 10 lakh acres of land across the state.
