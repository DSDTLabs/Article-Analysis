 actress 
  is one star who is known to speak her mind. The release of her next film ‘Begum Jaan’ has got the actress out and about the country promoting the period drama, set in the time of partition. During one of these many promotional events, Vidya was asked if she had ever been through a situation where her ego was hurt.
 
 Much to everyone’s delight, the actress did reveal an instance which dated back to her budding years in the film industry. Speaking about the incident, Vidya reminisced the time when she attended someone’s funeral from Bollywood and was surrounded by shutterbugs, eager to take her pictures and talk to her. However, on seeing 
  arriving behind her, the star said that the photographers “pushed her aside” to take the actor’s pictures.
  
 She went on to add that it was only after she went home and spoke to her family about the incident that she realised that Aamir was in the industry far longer than her and that he was held in much higher esteem. It was then that she contemplated over the norms of being a star and understood that the incident was “perfectly normal”.
  
 Vidya will be seen playing the role of a madam of a brothel in ‘Begum Jaan’ that is scheduled to hit screens on April 14.
