PANAJI: Candidates are anxiously waiting for the results as uncertainty prevails over who will form the next government in Goa. Counting of the February 4 polls begins today at 8 am.

 Sources say that not even the ruling   (BJP) which spoke of getting 26 seats is sure of touching the half way mark. For the first time in post-liberation history, BJP had secured a simple majority of 21 seats in 2012 to the 40-member assembly.
 
 This time, there were multiple factors that played against the BJP and speculations are ripe that some cabinet ministers including the chief minister   are not in comfort zone. Results of Mandrem constituency represented by the chief minister will be out in the first round (by 9.15).
 
 Rebel RSS leader Subhash Velingkar is confident that the people of Goa would reject the BJP "for its arrogancy and for cheating" the people on all the major promises it was elected on in 2012.
 
 This time, BJP also didn't have MGP, its important ally in 2012. When MGP walked out of the alliance, party supremo Ramkrishna 'Sudin' Dhavalikar said there is strong undercurrent of resentment against the ruling BJP.
 
 There were murmurs in the BJP when defence minister Manohar Parrikar admitted into the party fold and gave ticket to Congress Mauvin Godinho who he had alleged to be involved in the power subsidy scam in the 90s.
 
 Though the opposition Congress was not aggressive in its campaign, the party is witnessing resurgence.
