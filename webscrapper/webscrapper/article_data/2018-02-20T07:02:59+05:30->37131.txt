NEW DELHI: Lexus, the luxury division of Japanese car major  , has launched the company's LS car range in India, driving in the hybrid LS500h at Rs 1.8 crore and its top version at just over Rs 1.9 crore.

 
 The long-wheel base model is powered by a 3.5-litre petrol engine combined with a 310.8kV lithium-ion battery, delivering more than 15 kms to a litre in a BS6-compliant vehicle. It can accelerate from 0-100 kmph in 5.4 seconds.
 
 The multi-stage hybrid system offers greater efficiency with an amalgamation of the electric motor and a simulated 10-speed automatic transmission that enables precise shifts. The vehicle also features a 23-speaker Mark Levinson Quantum Logic Immersion (QLI) sound system, which delivers near-live performance quality audio.
 
 "We are thrilled to be adding the LS500h to our line-up here. When we think of the exacting standards of the most discerning Indian car owners, we are confident the new LS will impress and delight - through its design, its performance, and the efficiency of the world's first multistage hybrid system,"   chairman N Raja said.
 
 The car features a variety of comfort features that include 1,022mm of legroom, which is complemented by the comforts of Shiatsu massage technology, heating functions and Ottomans in the rear for added comfort. The company, which entered the Indian market last March, said it is looking at the possibility of assembling its vehicles locally by leveraging parent Toyota's facility in Bengaluru as an option.
 
 It also made a strong pitch to the government to provide support to hybrid vehicles in India's journey towards full electric vehicles.
