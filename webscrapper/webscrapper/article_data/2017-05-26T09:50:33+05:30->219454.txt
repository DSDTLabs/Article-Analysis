MUMBAI: Residents of the iconic   stretch, who protest even at the slightest intrusion at the heritage precinct, have welcomed large metal girders with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras on the central divider of the road by BMC, following the traffic police department's suggestion. Locals said the cameras were the need of the hour considering many cases of over-speeding and rash-driving. 

 Some residents were worried in April, when they saw the girders erected with two massive arms, for north and south-bound traffic, opposite gymkhanas on Marine Drive. They immediately wrote to BMC, seeking details on whether   (MHCC) permission had been taken. Their apprehensions were put to rest when they were told about the traffic police plan for various locations in the city, one of them being Marine Drive.
 
 Anil Bhatia, a resident of D Road and part of the  , said the cameras had become a necessity with changed times. 
 
 "At 8am on Thursday, vehicles sped across, much beyond prescribed limits. As one cannot have authorities stand on the stretch 24x7 to curb speeding, such checks by the cameras can be beneficial," said Bhatia.
 
 Another resident, Mahendra Hemdev, said, "Speeding of bikes is a serious problem and the cameras should be helpful. Traffic cops should increase punishment so that there are no repeated offenders," said Hemdev. BMC, in a letter to residents, clarified that traffic cops will constantly monitor the cameras and e-challans will be generated for over-speeding and rash-driving by detecting vehicle number plates. 
 
 Ashok Rao, from the  , said mostly bikers from other parts of the city over-speed on the stretch. Atul Kumar, vice-president of the Nariman Point Churchgate Citizens' Association, said this was a step in the right direction.
