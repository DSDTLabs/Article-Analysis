HYDERABAD: Afghan refugee   has alleged that former   inspector  , instead of extending help to him in tracing his missing wife and their three children, on the contrary, warned him in front of   Akbar, the second husband of Niloufer, not to meddle in her life. Fiaz's alleged inaction in October, 2017, contributed to delays in locating the missing persons, who were traced by Rajendranagar police on Friday. 

 "I made rounds of the Golconda police station for five days. Later, I was called to the police station, wherein I was introduced to one Akbar, who had married Niloufer. I was told by inspector Faiz that I should stay away from the couple. Faiz advised me to go to court to settle the issue and take the custody of the children ," Masood said, who approached the Golconda police with information that his missing family members were in Tolichowki. When the reference was made in the complaint to Rajendranagar police, the local police asked him to avoid mention of Fiaz. 
 
 Masood was also duped by three locals, who took money from the Afghan refugee, by offering to help him trace his missing family.
 
 When contacted, Fiaz, who a few months ago was promoted as assistant commissioner of police (Falaknuma), claimed he had never met Akbar. "Masood came to me with information that at a particular residence his estranged wife was staying. As my bounden duty, I sent a few of my men to the said house to get it verified, but by that time Masood's family members moved to some other house. The matter ended. As far as Akbar is concerned, I had never seen him. If Masood had approached me through Delhi police, with whom a missing case is pending, I could have taken up the issue. If I had come across Niloufer, I would have definitely acted," Fiaz told STOI.
