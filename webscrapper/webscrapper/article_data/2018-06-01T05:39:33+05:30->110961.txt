CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued notice to   chairman and director,   regional office, on the petition of 18 students of Bhavan Vidyalaya demanding   Class XII exams.

 On May 28, nearly 20 parents and scores of students of the Sector 27 school protested outside the CBSE’s regional office in Panchkula’s Sector 5 over less-than-expected scores in   Core. They had demanded the papers be rechecked and revaluated.
 
 In the court room, advocate Baltej Singh Sidhu said all the petitioners had secured 90% marks in all subjectsexceptEnglishin which their marks were very less, which had affected their overall percentage. As the CBSE had declined their request, they were left with no option but to move the high court.
 
 Sidhu argued that it is clear that the petitioners are brilliant students as they have secured good percentage in all subjects except English. “In case re-evaluation is not conducted, irreparable loss will be caused to the students as far as their admission into colleges and university for higher courses is concerned. It will also affect their chances in other competitive exams,” Sidhu said. In all, 250 students of Bhavan Vidyalaya sat for   exams this year. Out of 120 seats of commerce in Bhavan, hardly 30-35 students secured marks above 80 in English examination, while the rest have scored an average 70-75, much lower than what they expected. Across all the four streams, only 40 students had scored marks above 90 in English.
