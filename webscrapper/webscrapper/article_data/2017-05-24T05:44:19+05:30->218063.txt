LUCKNOW:   chief   was arrested from Aliganj on Tuesday for allegedly raping a 22-year-old   

 The girl, a native of Bahraich, died at the trauma centre here on February 24 this year. Her brother had lodged a complaint with Madiaon police alleging that Dr Ayub gave wrong medicines to his sister which led to her death. He also accused Dr Ayub of sexually exploiting her.
 
 Circle officer, Aliganj, Vivek Tripathi said Dr Ayub was arrested under Section 376 (2) (f) of the IPC (a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman) and for threatening the survivor. Tripathi said the allegations of culpable homicide were not found valid in the probe so far. 
 
 “We have arrested Dr Ayub on the basis of call detail records. Over 350 calls were exchanged between Dr Ayub and the girl, who used to live at a flat in Metro City that belonged to Dr Ayub,” said Tripathi.
 
 On March 23, then DIG Lucknow Praveen Tripathi had ordered a reinvestigation. Thereafter, SSP Lucknow had transferred the case to circle officer BKT. On April 17, the probe was transferred to CO Aliganj Vivek Tripathi.
 
 Ayub had approached the woman and her family to campaign for him in 2012 assembly polls and after winning he brought her to Lucknow for providing her better education, the complaint said.
 
 Ayub contested the   elections this year from the Doomariyaganj seat but lost.
