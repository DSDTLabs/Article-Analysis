NAGPUR: The   (NMC)   Zone office’s compound walls used to wear a dull look for years. On Sunday, the walls turned colourful and also highlighted a number of social initiatives. The transformation was brought about by a team of NGO I-Clean, Nagpur. 

 The team, along with assistant commissioner   and chairman of projects consultative committee Sanjay Bangale reached the zone office in the morning. 
 
 The team painted the walls of the zone office with their patent blood red colour. Then the team highlighted various initiatives, including NMC’s drives, through   art. The graffiti also included Beti Bachao-Beti-Padhao, Ek Kadam Swachhata Ki Aur, Save Water, Tree Plantation etc
 
 I-Clean Nagpur team includes doctors, engineers, chartered accountants, teachers and government employees. The team has been conducting its drive for the last two years. The motive is to encourage people to keep their and also public properties clean and smart. 
 
 The I-Clean, Nagpur, team has so far beautified Zero Mile, Sitabuldi flyover, compound walls of   and government departments .
 
 Dharampeth zone is now the first among the 10 zones to carry out such an innovative activity. The zone headed by Moroney is known for some unique concepts like state-of-the-art citizen facility centre, mobile idol immersion drive, e-rickshaw for public announcements etc
 
 The NMC with the help of NGOs, art educational institutions and famous artists had taken up graffiti competition last year when Shravan Hardikar was the municipal commissioner. The drive is likely to resume soon to cover remaining public walls across the city.
