NEW DELHI: Late for work, or just impatient? Next time you plan to weave through the traffic to reach your destination in a hurry, possibility is that you might fall foul of traffic cops. 

 Beginning Tuesday, traffic police has decided to launch a   on violation of lane  . 
 
 Officers said while the initial plan was to rein in errant DTC and cluster bus drivers, even private vehicles that enter bus lanes would be fined. 
 
 A similar crackdown will be conducted against visibly polluting vehicles and those overloaded with goods or parked improperly on road over the next few weeks. Dependra Pathak, special commissioner (traffic) said: “The idea is to reduce emissions.   violations result in chaos, thus wasting 45 seconds to a minute at every traffic signal. This adds to emissions on Delhi roads as vehicles are forced to move at low speeds.” 
 
 Traffic police has already issued a notice to DTC and DIMTS, informing them about the drive. 
 
 Officers said reining in bus drivers was a priority as the left side of the road was earmarked for them and these were being freed up as a part of an anti-encroachment drive on 28 corridors in the capital.
 
 Anyone found driving in the extreme left lane meant for  , too, would be booked, an officer said.
 
 The move comes days after LG Anil Baijal asked a joint action committee, comprising traffic police, Delhi government and civic body officials, to ensure lane discipline for buses. Joint commissioner (traffic)   said in the coming weeks, there would be a strong focus on curbing lane violations. 
 
 Traffic police had booked 2,360 buses for such violations in 2017. Already, 274 buses have been challaned till February 15 of this year.
