Director   and scriptwriter-actor   ' the team behind the cult hits Ee Adutha Kaalathu and Left Right Left ' are all set to team up for an upcoming revenge drama.

  This time, however, Murali Gopy will be seen in the role of an actor as the movie's screenplay is written by legendary filmmaker Padmarajan's son, Ananthapadmanabhan, who had earlier scripted the Rima Kallingal-starrer August Club.
  On the upcoming movie, Arun tells us, 'The film is based on a short story by the iconic filmmaker Padmarajan. It's a revenge drama and as of now we have finalised   and Murali Gopy in the lead roles. The heroine is yet to be cast.'
  The filmmaker says that Asif's role is different from the ones he has essayed so far. 'It's not an easy character. It needs good preparation and he is doing his homework for that,' says Arun.
 
  Elaborating on its plot, the director says, 'The story happens in a village in rural Kerala and we are currently scouting for locations. We are planning the shoot at villages near the borders of the State. We are yet to decide if it will be in North or South Kerala.'
  Will the yet-to-be-titled movie too have edge-of-the-seat moments like his previous films? 'There is no suspense element but it's got a great story,' says Arun, adding that the film will go on floors by March end. Deepak Dev will handle the music 
 department.
