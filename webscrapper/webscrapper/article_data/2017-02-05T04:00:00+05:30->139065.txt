Ahmedabad: Rekindling the bond of their marriage, Oscar Vargas Varela, 81, and his wife Maria Guadalupe Hernandez de Vargas, 76, from Mexico, married each other once again on Saturday, marking the 50th year of their wedding. The duo who are in Ahmedabad as volunteers for AFS to promote cultural exchange between India and Mexico, got married according to Hindu tradition in a closed ceremony of friends and loved ones.

 Parents to five children and grandparents to 10 grandchildren, they were inspired and touched by the Indian culture and hence decided to mark the 50th year of their marriage by tying a knot once again.
 
 “During our previous visit to India, we were indeed inspired by the culture and warmth of the people here. While we heard and read about little aspects of the culture here, we thought why not get a first-hand experience by getting married. Little elements of each traditions have such beautiful and deeper meanings,” said Oscar, who along with Maria will celebrate the anniversary of their first wedding on September 2.
 
 Talking about how she felt getting married to the same person again, Maria said, “I am just as impressed as I was the first time when I met him. And it is all the more special as we’re reuniting in the bond of marriage, and that too so traditionally.”
