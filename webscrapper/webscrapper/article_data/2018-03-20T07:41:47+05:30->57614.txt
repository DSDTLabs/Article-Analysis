KOLKATA: The leader of a con gang that struck almost 15 times in and around the city in the past year was finally nabbed by the Delhi Police crime branch on Sunday. Accused Kanhaiyaan   alias Guruji (48) was nabbed when he stepped out of the   (from Howrah) at New Delhi station.

 Singh used to fly into Kolkata from Delhi to train his gang members and then returned by Rajdhani Express with the booty. The operatives in Guruji’s gang mostly come from south India. According to the DCP (crime), Delhi Police, Bhism Singh, Rs 8 lakh in stolen cash, a country-made pistol and two cartridges were seized from him. A   team may travel to Delhi to question the accused. 
  
 
 During interrogation, the accused disclosed that he started stealing bags from cars at a very young age and became so proficient that he never got caught. He later formed a gang that operated in top-tier cities like Bengaluru and Kolkata.
 
 “He specifies roles for members according to their skills. The teams sent to Kolkata comprised five men and three women. Whenever the team managed to steal a substantial amount, they would intimate Singh. The accused would then take a flight to Kolkata, collect the money and go back to Delhi. That is why when local police nabbed some of the conmen, they could never trace the loot.
 
 Apart from taking care of their families, Singh also arranged for legal aid for those from his team who got arrested.
 
 The gang usually targeted cars. They distracted the drivers either by knocking on the window, puncturing tyres or pouring oil under the cars’ hoods at signals. When the driver got out to check what was wrong, a   would then lift the bags from the car.
 
 Kolkata Police officers said that now that Singh was caught, efforts were on to nab the other members as well.
