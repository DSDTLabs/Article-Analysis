Following his remarks in an interview to a Tamil magazine, the Tamil Film Producers' Council had temporarily removed   from the council, of which he is a member. Vishal had challenged the move in court, following which the council had told that court that they will revoke the decision if he tenders an apology. And now, the actor, who is also the secretary of the  , has done just that in an affidavit filed in the court.

 'I state that I had only expressed my personal views, maybe in a slightly strong manner but without any ulterior motive or intention to hurt anyone or create any controversy and ill-will. In fact, in the same interview itself, I have clarified that I have nothing personal against any of the elected office-bearers but still some of the individuals feel that I have made a personal attack,' his statement said. 
 
 He also stated that he had filed the affidavit in order to avoid further confrontation and in the interest of maintaining better relationship between various interlinked associations in the industry. Conveying his regrets, if any of his statements in the interview may have hurt anyone, the actor requested that his temporary suspension be revoked and that his normal membership restored.
