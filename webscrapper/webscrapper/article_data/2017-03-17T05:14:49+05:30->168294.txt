NEW DELHI: The   (Amendment) Bill seeking to set a single permanent tribunal should be referred to a standing committee for further examination as states had not been consulted, BJD member   has said.

 Mahtab has written to   Speaker   that inter-state water disputes are unlikely to be resolved by any state or central tribunal without the concurrence and consultation with the states.
 
 While BJD has protested against the Polavaram project in the past, its sharp opposition to the bill could be read in the context of BJPâ€™s surprise performance in the   panchayat polls where it increased its seats from 36 to nearly 300.
