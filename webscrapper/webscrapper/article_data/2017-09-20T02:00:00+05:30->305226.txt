PATNA: The railways has invited bids from firms to carry out preliminary engineering-cum-traffic survey for the proposed third line between   and Kiul stations on the mainline section of East Central Railway (ECR).

 The Union finance ministry has allocated about Rs 1.5 crore in the current merged budget to assess the feasibility of the third line.
 
 Sources said the ministry of railways would push for provision of funds for the purpose in the next general budget on the basis of the feasibility report. The Mughalsarai-Jhajha mainline route has already reached 180% saturation, making it difficult for smooth operation of trains on these age-old Up and Down lines, the sources said .
 
 A senior railway official told TOI on Tuesday the high saturation level was the main reason behind delayed running of passenger trains in the division. “Passenger and goods trains are running on the same tracks. It is high time a third line was laid between Mughalsarai and Kiul,” he said.
 
 The railway ministry had earlier allocated Rs 61 lakh in 2016 to conduct a third line survey between Buxar and Mokama. The survey report submitted to the Railway Board is learned to have highlighted the challenges the railways may face while laying the third line between Gulzarbagh and Patna Saheb stations due to space constraint, a railway official said.
 
 According to the sources, the railways is likely to incur an expenditure of about Rs 1.5 crore per km on laying a third line between Mughalsarai and Kiul.
