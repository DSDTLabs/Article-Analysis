 ACB officials say corruption has gone down due to their continuous campaign against it on social media and at government offices.
 
 Here's a closer look at the effect of demonetisation. In November and December 2016, the ACB registered 120 offences, down 35% from 184 offences filed in the last two months of 2015. “As people were rushing to deposit old notes of Rs 500 and Rs1,000, there was no black money left with them. Corrupt babus, worried at the situation, in panic disposed off their own black money ,“ said an ACB officer.
 
 Meanwhile, the state revenue department continues to have the dubious distinction of being the most corrupt, followed by the MMDRA, the police, Panchayat Samitis, the BMC and the education department. In 2016, the ACB booked 223 officials of the revenue department, 224 cops, 109 officials of Panchayat Samitis, 52 officials from the MMRDA, 50 BMC officials and 49 education department officials from all over the state for graft. ACB officials said Pune (186 cases) is the leading city on the state's corruption chart, followed by Nashik (153), Nagpur (137), Thane (124 ), Aurangabad (116), Amravati (110) and Nanded (104). Mumbai has only 66 of fences of corruption.
