KOCHI: Opposition leader   has approached the high court challenging the Thiruvananthapuram vigilance court's order for an enquiry into alleged promotion of N   to DGP rank and his appointment as vigilance director so as to subvert the bar bribery case and other cases against   leaders. 

 The order was issued by the vigilance court on December 30 last year while considering a petition filed by Paichira Navas of Pallipuram in Thiruvananthapuram. It was alleged in the complaint before the vigilance court that Reddy was given a promotion by overlooking a report of the home secretary. In addition to the alleged subversion of bar bribery case, the complaint had said that the promotion was for filing a favourable report before the   in favour of   and Tom Jose in an enquiry regarding construction of Kannur airport before getting environmental clearance.
 
 In the petition, Chennithala contends that even if the allegations are taken at their face value and accepted in its entirety, they do not constitute a cognizable offence warranting a preliminary enquiry as was ordered by the vigilance court. It is crystal clear that the complaint was filed at the instance of some IPS and IAS officers to target their opponents in the administrative service as part of the ongoing feud between a group of IPS and IAS officers in the state, the petition said.
 
 Granting promotion to Shanker Reddy and four others was in accordance with the powers granted to the state government as per rules (Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules of 1954), the petition said.
