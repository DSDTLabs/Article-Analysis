THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: More often than not authorities get stuck on land acquisition issues while trying to solve traffic congestions. However, some minor tweaks to the plan would solve the problems.   on Thiruvananthapuram -   road is an example.

 Till a month ago, heavy vehicles, including buses, coming from Elipodu found it really tough to negotiate the curve at Valiyavila junction to enter the Kattakkada road. Now a small portion of private land just in the centre of the tri-junction has been acquired and included as part of the junction, and the traffic blocks disappeared.
 
 It was former district collector   who first suggested PWD to acquire more than one cent of land from the adjacent private plot to solve the congestion at junction. “I completed all procedures including distribution of payment to acquire the land before leaving charge of district collector. The negotiations began with Rs 25 lakh for the land, which was finally agreed on Rs 7 lakh,” said Biju Prabhakar, who is the agriculture director now.
 
 Saji, who runs a shop at the junction, admitted that addition of the small stretch put an end to the issue of traffic congestion. “Now heavy vehicles can negotiate the curve easily. However, a portion of the newly widened road has caved in the other day,” he said.
 
 PWD executive engineer Suresh Kumar said they had checked the site and took corrective measures. “The land was dug up before acquiring. There were KSEB posts and trenches of BSNL. The trench was restored before tarring. However, it seems vehicles were allowed to ply before it was set. Now we will do some temporary restoration and allow the portion to set. The contractor has been asked to do rectification works after that,” he said.
 
 The presence of an auto stand in the widened portion remains an eyesore in the newly widened portion. Sources said that shifting the auto stand is a difficult task.
