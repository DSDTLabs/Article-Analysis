PUNE: The ongoing boycott of lectures by the students of   of Social Service (KIoSS) will enter its fifth day on Sunday. The students have been protesting against the management's decision to hike the annual fee by Rs 8,300.

 Savitribai   vice-chancellor   has termed the fee hike illegal. “As per the new Universities Act, there should be a fee fixation committee to approve the hike. Since other bodies of the university, as per the Act, are yet to be formed, the fee fixation committee too will take time. Hence, the college can’t randomly increase fee without approval,” Karmalkar said.
 
 He said, “We have already instructed the college to rollback the hike in fee. We have also asked the administration for a meeting on Monday to discuss the issue.”
 
 A student of the college said, “When we joined the institute, the prospectus had mentioned fee for both years. We are in our second year of the master’s programme and the management cannot increase the fee suddenly.
 
  We came to know about the hike in June during our vacations, but we were not very sure. When we came back, we saw the notice that the tuition fee has increased from Rs 14,980 to Rs 23,280. Even the hostel fee has been increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 21,000. We want the management to rollback the fee.”
 
 Another student said, “The increase in fee should be followed by some extra facilities or amenities, but nothing of that kind is happening. When asked, the only explanation that the director is giving is that they have to pay salary of visiting faculty, hence the hike. But this cannot be done in the middle of the term.”
 
 Despite repeated attempts, director of the college   did not respond to calls or messages.
