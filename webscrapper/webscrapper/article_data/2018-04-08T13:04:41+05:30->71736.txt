NEW DELHI:   has added a second   medal to his name after finishing third in the men’s 94kg final on Sunday, extending India’s overall tally at the   Games to 11. The 24-year-old from Ludhiana, who claimed silver (85kg) four years ago in Glasgow, finished with an overall effort of 351kg (159 in snatch and 192 in clean & jerk) to take home a bronze at the Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre on Sunday. 

 
 
 
 With today’s bronze, Vikas has taken India’s   medal tally at the Gold Coast games to eight. His medal came on a day in which weightlifter Punam Yadav opened India’s account with gold in the women’s 69kg final, followed by shooters Manu Bhaker and Heena Sidhu winning gold and silver respectively in the women’s 10m air pistol event and Ravi Kumar a bronze in the men’s 10m air rifle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Having won silver four years at the last   and a bronze six months ago at the Commonwealth Championships in Gold Coast, Vikas entered the competition as the fifth-best entrant in terms of registered weight. In the snatch section, he lifted 152kg and 156kg in his first and second attempts and then added three kilos on the bar to successfully lift 159kg. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Once Canada’s Boady Santavy - the son of a World Weightlifting Championships contestant and grandson of a two-time Olympian - set a CWG record of 168kg in the snatch, Vikas found himself at second place in the standings heading into the clean & jerk. In the final section, Vikas successfully lifted 192 kg in his first attempt to top the table for a brief period, but a failure to lift 200 in his second attempt saw him fall 13 points behind Santavy. Aiming for silver, Vikas again attempted 200 in his final lift but the risk did not pay off as he could not complete the jerk. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 A total of 351kgs kept Vikas in contention for a bronze, which was assured seconds later when Samoan Siaosi Leuo failed in his final attempt. 
 
 Stunningly, Papua New Guinea’s Steven Kari smashed three records in his final lift - a career record, a Games record and a total weight record - to dislodge Santavy from the top spot and take gold with a combined effort of 370kg (154 in snatch, 216 in clean & jerk). Santavy settled for silver with a combined effort of 369kg (168 in snatch, 201 in clean & jerk). 
 
 Thakur first came into prominence at the 2014 Glasgow CWG when at the age of 20 he won the 85kg silver with lifts of 150kg in snatch and 183kg in clean & jerk. The following year, he lifted 341kg (154 in snatch and 187 in clean & jerk) to create a new national record at the National Weightlifting Championship, surpassing his own mark of 339kg. 
 
 However, things turned sour for Vikas when he failed to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Putting the setback behind him, Vikas moved his weight category up to 94kg and went to the Commonwealth Championships in Gold Coast in September 2017 where he won a bronze medal with a lift of 340kg (150 in snatch, 190 in clean & jerk). A month later, his name was confirmed for the CWG.
