BELAGAVI: Buoyed by the rise in the number of tigers at  , AnshiDandeli and Mahadayi wildlife sanctuaries, environmentalists have proposed that the three protected reserves spread across 22,000 square kilometres and straddling three states ­ Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra ­ be integrated.

 A proposal has been submitted to the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Karnataka forest department.However, a proposal to declare  , which was made years ago, is yet to be considered.
 
 Giridhar Kulkarni, an environmentalist, said Bhimgad was turning into an important tiger habitat. “Camera traps installed by the forest department have spotted six tigers. More importantly, Bhimgad is surrounded by forests that serve as the catchment area of Mahadayi, Malaprabha, Pandri, Markandeya and other rivers, which serve as the lifeline of the people of Goa and  ,“ he added.
 
 The Bhimgad sanctuary is contiguous with the Mahadayi Tiger Reserve, Dandeli-Anshi protected area and other reserve forests in Goa. The forests spread across Mookambika, Anshi-Dandeli and Mahadayi reserve areas cover an area of 6,469sqkm. The combined tally of tigers in these forests comes up to around 51.
 
 However, the forests in North Karnataka and Goa can house more tigers, and integrating the adjoining reserve forest areas will not only boost the population of the big cats but also help conserve the rich biodiversity in the region, said sources.
