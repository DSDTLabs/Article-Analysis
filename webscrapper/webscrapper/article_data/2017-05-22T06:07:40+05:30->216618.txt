VISAKHAPATNAM: North Andhra is not a backward region due to lack of resources, but because of   of people’s representatives, said   Konathala   at seminar on ‘Backwardness of Uttarandhra:   organised at the AU   Hall on Sunday. 

 Apart from Konathala, Pradesh Congress chief N Raghuveera Reddy, CPI leader from Rayalaseema K Rama Krishna, former vice-chancellor Andhra University Prof KV Ramana, Loksatta Party national president Jayaprakash Narayana and senior Congress leader Viswanadham also attended the seminar as speakers.
 
 “Irrigation projects such as the Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi are yet to take off. More importantly, the step-motherly treatment towards the region has become obvious with both the state and central governments ignoring our demands for a separate railway zone and development of educational institutions,” Konathala said.
 
 Prof Ramana urged the people of north Andhra to assert themselves and fight for their rights. “Migrants have become public representatives in our region. The people here have been duped over the last 30 years and it is time for them to stand up like the people of Rayalaseema,” he said.
 
 “ If the Mahandi and Godavari rivers are linked and if the Polavaram left canal is extended all the way to Vizianagaram district and beyond, water will never be an issue. There are other problems as well, however decentralisation is the only way to address the issue,” said Lok Satta chief Jayaprakash Narayana.
