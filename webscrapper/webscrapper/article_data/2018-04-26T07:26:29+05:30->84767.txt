LUCKNOW: Haji  , famous as ‘Mango Man’, underwent a heart surgery at a private hospital on Tuesday. His family, however, claimed they first took him to KGMU’s   late Monday night but the doctors sent them away.

 The family had rushed   to Lucknow from   after he complained of chest pain.
 
 Kaleemullah (78), famous for breeding over 300 different varieties of mangoes and naming them after celebrities, is now recuperating.
 
 His son   told TOI that doctors at   that his condition was not worrisome and that they could take him back home.
 
 “A private specialist in Lucknow gave my father a medicine and asked us to take him to Lari Cardiology immediately. We reached there by 10.30pm but the junior doctors there conducted a check-up for 15 minutes and advised that nothing seemed to be worrisome and asked us to go back home.”
 
 The family felt Kaleemullah’s condition was not good so they consulted their family doctor again andtook him to a private facility in Gomtinagar.
 
 “Doctors here admitted my father immediately and told us he had almost 90% blockage,” he said.
 
 KGMU chief medical superintendent however denied any medical negligence. “The doctors on duty would have advised the family correctly. There must have been no requirement for a medical procedure then. As for his being operated upon in a private facility, we would not like to comment on it,” said CMS, Prof SN Shankhwar.
 
 Kaleemullah will be discharged by weekend.
