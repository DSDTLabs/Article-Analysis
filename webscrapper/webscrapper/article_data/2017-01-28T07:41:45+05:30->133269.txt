CHENNAI: Boominathan's dream to see his son get married will never be realised. On Thursday, Army officers told him that his son  , 27, was no more, having been killed in an avalanche. A visibly upset Boominathan said the last time his son came home, he had constructed a toilet for them. "He was very keen on building a new house and eagerly discussed plans with me over phone. None of this will ever come to be," he said. 

 Boominathan and his wife Amutha, agricultural workers from   near Orathanadu taluk in  , were making plans to get their son married. 
 
 The second son of the family, Ilavarasan had joined 51 Rashtriya Rifles in 2012, after completing BA Economics. He was posted at Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir. His elder sister B Sutha is married while his younger brother B Vinothkumar is seeking a job. "At 9pm on Thursday, I received a call from an officer at the Gurez military base in Kashmir Valley, informing me that my son had died in an avalanche in Kashmir while he was on duty. Due to dense fog he was unable to travel home, even though his leave had been sanctioned," said Boominathan.
 
 He has appealed to the district administration to do the needful to bring the mortal remains of his son home at the earliest.
 
 Ilavarasan had contacted R Jayakumar, his sister Sutha's husband, who works in a tea shop, over phone last week that even though he had been sanctioned 35 days of leave, he was unable to return home because he had to cover for his colleague who was unwell. "He should have been home for Pongal itself. However, as the situation in the valley was out of control, he called me and expressed his inability to return home," said Jayakumar. 
 
 AIADMK general secretary   on Friday, condoled the death of the armymen in the avalanche.
