MUNGER: The state election commission on Tuesday cancelled the nomination papers of   and his wife Ruma Raj, who were contesting the   (MMC) elections scheduled for May 21. DDC-cum returning officer Rameshwar Pandey confirmed the commission order.

 Sources said outgoing mayor  , who is contesting against Ruma from ward number 32, had lodged a complaint with the commission that her rival and her husband concealed some facts in their affidavits, like a pending criminal case against him.
 
 Verma was also a candidate from ward number 29. He was allotted pen and inkpot symbol while his wife Ruma was in the fray on aeroplane symbol. 
 
 “Both Ruma and Subodh had started campaigning in their respective wards after the allotment of symbols following scrutiny of their papers by the returning officer,” said a person close to Subodh. 
 
 Ruma and Subodh on Wednesday said they would challenge the election commission order in the Patna high court. They also denied the allegation of concealing facts while filing their nomination papers.
