GANDHINAGAR: Soon after the   allowed Gujarat government to accept in-charge DGP PP Pandey’s offer to relinquish his office, MoS (Home)   revealed that Pandey had submitted his resignation on Saturday itself. 

 “The in-charge DGP wanted to avoid embarrassment to the state government and put in his papers on Saturday. We informed the Supreme Court about Pandey’s resignation on Monday,” Jadeja said. He added, “Pandey’s resignation will be accepted officially on Tuesday and a decision on his successor will be taken immediately.”
 
 About Pandey’s tenure, Jadeja said, “He served the state for 37 years and it has been an illustrious career. Police has filed a chargesheet but the court is yet to frame charges against him. He was given an extension in the wake of the new prohibition law that was passed by the state assembly which had to be effectively implemented.” Jadeja further said, “There was also the responsibility of conducting recruitment of 17,000 new police constables in state in the coming months for which we needed Pandey’s expertise.”
 
 Earlier in the day Jadeja spent close to an hour at CM Vijay Rupani’s residence discussing the matter of Pandey’s successor. Senior   leaders said the government will consult with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and national BJP president   before appointing a successor.
