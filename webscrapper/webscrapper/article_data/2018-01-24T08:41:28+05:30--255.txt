KOLKATA:   paid the price for poor catching and some sloppy ground fielding as they let   steal a fivewicket win in the Group B Super League tie of the   meet at Eden Gardens on Tuesday.

 
  once again led from the front to help UP put up 162 for 4. Chasing a shade above eight an over, Tamil Nadu got off to a flying start with   (30 off 19 balls) smashing Ankit Rajpoot for three boundaries in the second over. Fellowopener  , though, led a charmed life, being let off by Shivam Chaudhury at point off Praveen Kumar and then left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar grassing a simple caught-and-bowled chance. It hurt UP as Sundar and Sanjay Yadav put on 64 runs for the second wicket in 7 overs.
 
 Even Yadav (52 off 32 balls, 2x4, 3x6) survived a dropped chance. UP also reprieved Bharath Shankar, besides conceding 8-10 extra runs through misfields.
