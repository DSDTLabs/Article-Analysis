Shah Rukh Khan, Bollywood’s uncrowned king of romance, will be seen indulging in some hardcore action in Rahul Dholakia’s upcoming ' '. 

 Interestingly, it’s been more than two decades since the superstar has performed out-and-out raw, rugged action — the last few being hits like ' ' (1993), ' ' (1993) and 'Anjaam' (1994). Well, looks like the long wait has been worth it. The trailer of 'Raees' has already given us a glimpse of SRK’s exciting stunt sequences, which, the makers claim, is only the tip of it. Shah Rukh has performed at least five elaborate chase sequences in the film — from fighting goons in narrow lanes to jumping from building terraces, he has done it all. 
 
 Interestingly, a lot of thought has gone into each action sequence. SRK and Dholakia, we hear, have ensured that each sequence has a different flavour and is complemented by a strong background music.
