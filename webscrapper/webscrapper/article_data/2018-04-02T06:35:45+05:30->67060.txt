NEW DELHI:   ( ) in stock markets more than halved to Rs 26,000 crore in 2017-18 on fears of faster than expected rate hike by the   and higher valuations of Indian equities.

 In comparison, overseas investors had put in Rs 55,700 crore in equities in 2016-17 after pulling out over Rs 14,000 crore in the preceding fiscal, according to the data with depositories.
 
 However, a sharp turnaround was seen in FPI inflows into debt markets in the just-concluded fiscal as foreign investors poured in a staggering Rs 1.2 lakh crore in the segment against a net outflow of about Rs 7,300 crore in 2016-17.
 
 Lower FPI investment in equities in financial year 2017-18 compared to the preceding fiscal does not come as a surprise. The decline has been steady on account of various factors such as Indian market traded at a premium to many other markets,  , the Head of MF Research at  , said.
 
 "Fear of faster than expected US Fed rate hike resulted in outflows from FPIs in equity," she added. On the other hand, a stable currency coupled with a higher post-inflation return in lay year led to higher inflows in debt. However, the situation is slowly reversing as there have been debt outflows in February and March of 2018.
 
 Overall net foreign capital inflows of Rs 1.5 lakh crore have made 2017-18 as the best period for Indian capital markets (equity and debt) in past three financial years.
