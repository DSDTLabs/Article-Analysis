Karan Johar's next guests are two actresses who do not like to mince words. Yes, we are talking about new mommy   and fashionista  . The two will be seen in the upcoming episode of  , and the teaser seems all fun.
 
 When Karan asks Kareena if she likes to answer questions about who is better between Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone, she doesn't bat an eyelid before responding that they both are in Hollywood now. To this, Sonam laughs and cheekily says she is also headed there. 
 
 
  
 Next, Kareena reveals that she'd give Sonam an award for Neerja. Rather, she'd give everyone all the awards, as she is only interested in rewards. Enjoying the banter between them, Sonam confesses how she loves Kareena's candid replies.
 
 
  
 
 What steals the show, however, is how Kareena says she would kill herself if stuck in an elevator with cousin Ranbir's exes Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif. She tells Karan how she would not like to be in that position ever, especially in such condition (Kareena was pregnant when she shot for the show).
