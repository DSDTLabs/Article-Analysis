GURUGRAM:   was a silent boy, but full of life. That’s how   remember him. 

 Ratan Verma, who stays close by, said, “The kid liked cycling. I would often see him taking his cycle out for a ride. A day before his death, I saw him falling from his bicycle, but even before I could go to pick him up, he smiled and said, “uncle I’m okay”. He was so well-behaved, even if we met seven times a day, he would not fail to greet me each time.” 
 
 Pradhyumn’s father Barun got married nine years ago, after which he moved to Maruti Kunj. Radha Kunoj, their neighbour in Maruti Kunj, reminisces how the family loved being together. “Barun Thakur moved in to   after he got married to Jyoti. It was here that both their children were born. I had seen Pradhyumn learn to walk, and later try to ride his bicycle, here.” 
 
 Even the Bohras, who moved into the locality a month ago, could recall how cheerful the boy was. “His mother (Jyoti) used to give tuitions in the evening. She taught children from Class I to IV. For an hour in the evening every day, she would sit in front of her house while her kids played in the neighbourhood. She would walk him back from school, carrying his bag. I remember seeing Pradhyumn walking with her, playing with his water bottle,” said Aarti Bohra, neighbour. 
 
 Pradhyumn liked playing cricket and spinning tops. Chirag Sharma, his playground friend, said, “While playing cricket, he never said no to fielding, batting or bowling. He used to say when he grew up, he wanted to play like Sachin Tendulkar. He liked wearing a black t-shirt to the playground. Whenever India played a cricket match, he would be glued to the TV set.” 
 
 Dolly Raut, yet another neighbour, said, “He never took anything from anyone without his mother’s permission, including when I offered him chocolate or candy.”
