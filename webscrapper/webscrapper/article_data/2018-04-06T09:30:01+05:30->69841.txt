PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa, on Thursday, adjourned to April 19 the hearing on plea seeking transfer of the Finnish national Felix   murder case from Goa police to the CBI.

 During the hearing the court said that it would go through the closure report filed by the police and hear the petition to see whether it can be considered. When the matter came up before court, advocate Shikha Sethia, representing Dahl’s mother Minna  , told the court that the prosecution has only been seeking time. Police have filed closure report in the case.
 
 In her petition, Pirhonen said that she didn’t want Goa police to conduct any further investigation and that she wanted the case to be transferred to CBI. In December, Dahl’s mother, through her representative, had handed over a list of submissions and witnesses to the high court. In her submission she had stated that phone records of one of the suspects hadn’t been obtained and that his relationship with other suspects was not yet established.
 
 Goa police have decided not to file a chargesheet in the case stating that they hadn’t found any evidence to prove the murder. In 2016, the case was registered as a murder after the judicial magistrate first class directed Goa police to do so. 
 
 Dahl, 22, who came to Goa on a holiday in October 2014, was last seen at a restaurant at   in Canacona. 
 
 His body was found on a gravel road 200m away from the restaurant on the morning of January 28, 2015.
