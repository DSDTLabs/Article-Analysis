CHENNAI: Claiming it has been a year since 18 rebel   MLAs were disqualified by TN assembly speaker, and that the people of the constituencies were deprived of their right to have an elected representative in the assembly, an advocate clerk requested the Madras high court either to pass orders on the pleas moved by the MLAs assailing disqualification or permit ECI to notify election to the constituencies.

 Advocate Clerk   made an urgent mention in this regard, when the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   commenced their hearing on Monday morning.
 
 Refusing to hear the issue on urgent basis, the bench asked Devarajan to file a formal petition. On September 18, TN speaker disqualified 18 MLAs for allegedly acting against the party and defying whip. The disqualification was immediately challenged by the MLAs in the high court. After concluding the hearing, the first bench of the court reserved its order on January 24.
