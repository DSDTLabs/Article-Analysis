PUNE: A day-long strike called by   and Uber drivers demanding an increase in commission took a violent turn on Thursday as some agitators damaged three cabs at Hinjewadi,   and Hadapsar.

 They also attacked drivers of the three vehicles for not participating in the strike. 
 
 Eight drivers were arrested and four booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The cab drivers were protesting against “low earning” due to the rise in the number of vehicles and “insufficient” bookings.
 
 They want the aggregators to stop new registrations on the ground that the existing cabbies could not generate maximum business. The strike hit daily commuters hard, especially IT employees.
 
 Joint commissioner of police Sunil Ramanand said, “We have registered three complaints of cabs being damaged and their drivers assaulted. The incident did not lead to and law and order problem.”
 
 In Vimannagar, six agitators intercepted a cab, beat up its driver and passenger and damaged its windscreen on Thursday.
