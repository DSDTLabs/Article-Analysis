MAPUSA:   Municipal Council (MMC) has claimed it has completed 80% of pre-monsoon works. Chairperson   said that three agencies were deployed to carry out the works, and that two tenders amounting to Rs 25 lakh were awarded this year. The work includes desilting of small nullahs and gutters, cleaning up drainages, etc.

 “The contractors have submitted the report of the work status to me, and the review shows that the 80% is complete,”   said. “We are trying to complete all the work before the monsoon sets in,” he added.
 
 Sources said that the MMC is trying hard to complete the pre-monsoon work amidst allegations that the work has been delayed, raising fears of flooding during the fast-approaching monsoon. There were allegations from some quarters that the municipality left the mud excavated from gutters on the roadside, and that if this was not removed, it would flow back into the gutters when it rains.
