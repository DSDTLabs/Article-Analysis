TRICHY: Being one of the least explored tourist destinations across the central districts,   near Thuraiyur is now gearing up for a major facelift. Cited as one of the long pending demands of the hamlets close to Thuraiyur and Uppiliyapuram, a proposal to establish a checkdam and a hydropower generation unit was discussed by the district administration on Saturday.

 Puliyancholai is situated around 74km from the district headquarters by the streams of Aiyaru River originating from   in Namakkal district. Despite being an ideal hangout spot, the place was least explored by tourists. Sources said that Aiyaru during monsoons recharges 12 tanks near Uppiliyapuram and Thuraiyur and would have surplus water and merges with   near Vathalai. A proposal to build a checkdam near Puliyancholai was floated years ago since the 48-km journey of the river from Puliyancholai till Vathalai has not any water conservation projects. But the proposal did not materialise so far.
 
 Reviving the proposal, district collector K Rajamani, Perambalur MP R P Marutharaaja and Public Works Department (PWD) officials inspected the spot. “A detailed project report has been sought from PWD. Since a checkdam alone will not attract international aid, a plan to include a hydropower generation unit was also discussed,” Marutharajaa said. PWD sources said that the checkdam planned in Puliyancholai besides conserving the surplus water in Aiyaru would promote tourism in the region. Tourism development activities such as improving the park and recreational water sports along Aiyaru in Puliyancholai were discussed. Marutharajaa said that a proposal to establish a commercial complex was also suggested.
