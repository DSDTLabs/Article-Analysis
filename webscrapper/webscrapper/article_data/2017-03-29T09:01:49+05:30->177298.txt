PATNA: The Jain Shwetambar Terapanthi Mahasbha on Tuesday gave its prestigious   to Bihar chief minister   for initiating and implementing prohibition in the state.

 The award was conferred on the CM by   at a function in the S K Memorial Hall.
 
 Nitish was selected for the award by the  , a central body of the Anuvrat movement of Jain Muni Acharya Tulsi. The award carried a certificate, a memento, a shawl and Rs 1.51 lakh.
 
 While dedicating the award to the people of Bihar and announcing that the award money would be donated to the CM Relief Fund, Nitish recalled how the idea to ban alcohol came to his mind. “This is the very stage from where I announced that I would enforce prohibition when the audience, mostly women, made a demand to the effect on July 9, 2015,” he said.
 
 He said slogans favouring prohibition appeared on the walls at nearly nine lakh places across the state even before drinking became an offence in April last year. Approximately 25,000 street plays were staged to educate people about the ban and ill-effects of liquor consumption.
 
 “I was a tad sceptical about how quickly the prohibition would be adopted, specially in cities. However, my apprehensions proved unfounded as people almost immediately accepted and appreciated the move,” the CM said.
 
 Nitish also contested the claim that the ban would deprive the government of Rs 5,000 crore which it could have earned from taxes on liquor sales. “Our revenue collection in 2015-16 was around Rs 25,449 crore and we expect a better collection in 2016-17 even after the prohibition,” he said.
 
 Governor  , who was also present on the occasion, said he was also in two minds on the success of prohibition in Bihar as it had failed in other states. “I approved the government’s decision after much contemplation, and I am happy it is successful,” the governor said.
