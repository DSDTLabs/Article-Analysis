Mumbai:   and   driv-er partners are demanding scrapping of several clauses in the new  , including  , painting the  , installing   and restricting drivers to operate within Mumbai region.

 A delegation of the Action Committee of Maharashtra, which comprises several   and cab owners, met senior BJP functionaries and ministers at Mantralaya on Tuesday to air its grievances. They plan to meet the chief minister soon. 
 
 “The City Taxi scheme, with its stringent clauses, could sound a death knell for driver partners...if we accept all terms,” said Yakub Mehta of the committee. He pointed out that the permit fee for Ola and Uber drivers was in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 2.61 lakh, while it was nott applicable for black-and-yellow and Cool Cab drivers.
 
 President of Sangharsh Tourist Chalak Malak Sangh, a registered tourist taxi union, Raju Patil agreed that the clauses were ‘unfriendly’ and ‘unwarranted’. The union will take a delegation to state transport commissioner Praveen Gedam this week, he added.
 
 The new scheme also demands 30% cabs to be of higher engine capacity and this too was not practically feasible, drivers argued. 
 
 A senior transport official said the purpose of the scheme was to regulate the operations of aggregator cabs and create a level-playing field between them and kaali-peeli taxis. “The scheme aims to cap surge pricing. The new fare structure will soon be decided by a state-appointed committee,” the official said. “Moreover, cabs operating with all-India tourist permits will have to convert to app-based taxi permits. They will also have to sport a public service vehicle badge, which will ensure that the bona fides of drivers are checked.”
