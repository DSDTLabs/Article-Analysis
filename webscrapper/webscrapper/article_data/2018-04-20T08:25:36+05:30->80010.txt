JAIPUR: A bike-borne unidentified man allegedly tried to abduct an eight-year-old girl when she was returning to her house from a nearby shop in   area of the city on Thursday morning.

 The parents of the minor girl told   police station that their daughter had gone out to buy milk and was returning when an unidentified youth riding on motorcycle asked the girl about her school.
 
 During the conversation, the man forcefully made her to sit on his bike and rode towards a different direction when an auto-rickshaw driver had a quarrel with the suspect. The girl leaped out of the bike and ran towards her house.
