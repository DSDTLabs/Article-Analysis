Jaipur: The Union Rural Development and Panchayati Raj department has sanctioned an additional Rs 645 crore for material component under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) for the last fiscal.

  Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar made the announcement on the request of his state counterpart Rajendra Singh   on Tuesday.
 
 Rathore met the Union minister in New Delhi on Tuesday. He said since the allocation for the state was less in the last fiscal, the expenditure on material was reduced to 32.57% compared to labour. But the ratio for labour and material component should be 60:40.
 
 Rathore impressed upon the Union minister that if Rs 645 crore material component is added in the Central grant for the current fiscal it would further vitiate the labour-material ratio. He, therefore, requested the Union minister that remaining money on material component be adjusted in the previous yearâ€™s grant.
 
 The Union minister agreed to give Rs 645 crore by April 10.
