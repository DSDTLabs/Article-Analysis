PANAJI: Activist Aires   on Friday moved the   seeking the appointment of a public information officer at the   under the Right To Information (RTI) Act 2005.

 Despite being a public authority, the governor’s house does not make mandatory disclosures under the act, he stated in his complaint. “The Raj Bhavan is covered under the definition of ‘public authority’ and the failure to appoint a public information officer is illegal,” Rodrigues claimed.
 
 “All other Raj Bhavans across India, and even the  , comply with the RTI Act. Instead of strengthening the law, the   has allowed it to be weakened. It is imperative that it be made open to public scrutiny,” he added.
