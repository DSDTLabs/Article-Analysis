NEW DELHI: Three men accused of   a 22-year-old youth in a forested area adjacent to   in   were arrested on Sunday, a day after the incident was reported by TOI. A hunt is on for the fourth accomplice. DCP (southeast)   has confirmed the arrests.

 The youth’s woman friend, who was with him at the time of the incident, said that the horror unfolded within 10 minutes. She said that she met Naresh around 2pm on Saturday near the monkey park. After sitting there for over two hours, the couple decided to leave when they were ambushed by the four men in their 20s.
 
 “The men saw us alone and decided to rob us. They asked us for our mobile phones, but when Naresh refused to give it they started thrashing him,” the girl said. Despite the beatings, Naresh continued to hold onto the mobiles, which angered the accused. They then held his hands and stabbed him in his chest puncturing his heart after which he fell to the ground.
 
 The woman said that even though Naresh lay bleeding on the ground, the accused didn’t let her attend to him. “They came to me and told me to give them my earrings and nose pin. I gave it to them and requested them to let me take care of Naresh. However, they threatened to kill me if I moved an inch,” the girl said. The accused men finally allowed her to move when she agreed not to tell anyone about the incident.
 
 The couple had met four months ago at a wedding where Naresh was working as a catering supervisor and the girl had been hired as a beautician. They became friends and started seeing each other.
 
 The victim lived with his father Kajormal, mother and elder brother, a contractor, in Trilokpuri of east Delhi. 
 
 His uncle, Kailash Singh, said police officers told them about the stabbing on Saturday evening.
