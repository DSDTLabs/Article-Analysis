MUMBAI: A year and a half after being arrested on   and sexually assaulting one of them, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court recently acquitted two men after both girls did not support the prosecution's case and were declared hostile. "Considering the inconsistency in the version of both witnesses, it is clear they are not bringing the correct picture before the court. Hence, their evidence is not believable," the court said. 

 The duo was represented by advocates Amrish   and Preeyanca More. "The age of the alleged victims could not be established either through birth certificates or by conducting ossification tests to attract provisions of  . Even medical evidence is silent on the aspect of history of sexual violence," Salunke said.
 
 The prosecution had alleged that on August 29, 2016, when one of them was called to meet the accused, she took her friend along. The prosecution said he forced them to board an auto from   to Govandi, where he snatched the phone of one of them and switched it off. It stated that despite the girls' pleas to let them go home, he forced them to board a train to Reay Road station, where he left them alone for sometime and then returned. The accused then took them back to the house of the second accused in Govandi, where he sexually assaulted one girl all night, and later let them go. The girl later called her mother and a case was filed.
 
 The court pointed out that if the chronology of events was seen, when the accused took victims at Reay Road and left them alone, there was ample opportunity for them to run away or seek help from the public or police. "But they did not do that. In view of that, the theory of the prosecution appears doubtful," the court said.
