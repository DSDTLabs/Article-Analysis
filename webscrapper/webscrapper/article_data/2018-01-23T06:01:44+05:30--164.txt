CHENNAI: While protests continued across Tamil Nadu demanding rollback of the hike in bus fares, an advocate has approached the Madras   seeking its interference in the issue.

 When a division bench of Justices R Subbiah and T Ravindran commenced proceedings around 10.30am, advocate   made a mention about the fare hike and sought the court to hear the plea on an urgent basis.
 
 William said the hike was unjustified, arbitrary and made without following procedures. He wanted the court to interfere immediately by passing an interim order restraining the government from collecting the revised fares which are adversely affecting people.
 
 But refusing an urgent hearing, the bench asked the lawyer to file a proper petition which would be taken up in due course.
 
 Another PIL was filed in the court by  , a resident of Tiruvannamalai, alleging that the state government had been spending public money for achieving its political goal and had shifted the burden on people claiming financial crisis in transport corporations. “The fare hike is like adding fuel to fire when people are already put to great suffering by GST and demonetisation,” the PIL said.
 
 After six years, the Tamil Nadu government increased bus fares on January 19. Minimum fare on   buses in Chennai has been increased from Rs 3 to Rs 5 and the maximum from Rs 14 to Rs 23. In case of non-metros, the hike was in the range of Rs 3 to Rs 19.
