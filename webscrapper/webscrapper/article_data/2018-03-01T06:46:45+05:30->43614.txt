 TOI has learnt that handling and resolution of grievances related to the Delhi Police was one of the agenda items of the 24th interaction through PRAGATI —the ICTbased, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation. The Delhi Police made a detailed presentation on the grievances received by them and the status of their resolution, sources said.
 
 Sources said taking note of less feedback from people, PM said that the number and type of feedback shows about the effective functioning of a department.
 
 A PMO release said, “The Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to the Delhi Police. He stressed on the importance of improving the quality of disposal of grievances.”
 
 Home secretary Rajiv Gauba and Delhi Police chief Amulya Patnaik took part in the interaction.
 
 An official, on condition of anonymity, said the PM referred to how complaints are closed after addressing the grievances. “He said police need to see what relief or satisfaction the complainants got,” the official said.
 
 Sources said Gauba pointed out how almost half of the complaints that the Delhi Police receives have little to do with it and are mostly related to non-police issues.
 
 The PM also reviewed the progress of reconstruction work at Kedarnath in Uttarakhand. The state government presented the progress of work through drone imagery taken on Wednesday morning.
