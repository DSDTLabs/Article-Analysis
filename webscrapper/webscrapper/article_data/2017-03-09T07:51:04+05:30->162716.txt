MYSURU: Tipu’s armoury is just 20 metres from its new location. As on Wednesday, the monument had moved 100mtrs from its old location to make way for the completion of the Mysuru-Bengaluru track doubling work.

 On Thursday, experts will move the armoury 20 more metres to its final destination. On Friday, experts will finally place it at its new demarcated place. It will take at least a month for the 1,000 tonne monument to be fixed to its new place.
 
 On Tuesday, Sanjiv Agarwal, divisional railway manager, Bengaluru division,  , visited the place to take stock of the work. Agarwal spent over two hours at the site understanding how the monument is being translocated, a first in Asia. The monumental scale of the exercise left him and other railway officials who had accompanied him spellbound.
 
 The on-going shifting process has attracted people from not only across Srirangapatana but also from other places. Five engineers including technicians from the USA are confident of placing it at its new location by Friday. Agarwal said that the alignment is clear for completion of the rest of the doubling work and the track in this particular stretch will be commissioned by the April-end.
 
 Feeling the heat
 
 Jamin Buckingham, project manager, and one among the five experts from the US is feeling the summer heat. “Though the technique used here is almost the same as the one we have used in the US, the only difference are the people and the weather. It’s really too hot here. But we are going all out in our efforts to shift the historical monument within the time fixed,’’ he told TOI.
 
 Do you know Modi?
 
 When Jamin was introduced to former Hassan MP Javare Gowda, to everyone’s surprise he asked Javare Gowda, “Do you know Modi?” to which   replied in the affirmative. Jamin then quipped, “Even in America people talk about Modi.”
