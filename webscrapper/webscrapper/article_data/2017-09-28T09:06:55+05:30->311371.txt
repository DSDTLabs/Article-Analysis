AJMER: The state government directed all private and government   to conduct verification of all employees who are working on contract or temporary basis. The government also instructed schools to form three-member committees to keep a vigil over everyday activities.

 Though the government has not mentioned the reasons for issuing these guidelines, officials stated that it was due to the recent incident at a school in Gurugram where a student was found dead in the toilet.
 
 Schools have been asked to keep records of drivers of autos, vans, buses or any private vehicle, and verify the same with the police.
 
 Similarly, they have to keep a vigil on suspicious or unknown people in the school and surroundings, and inform the police if they are not satisfied after the verification of such people. “The state government is working to prevent any such incident and harassment of any student,” said state education minister Vasudev Devnani. He added that these guidelines should be followed strictly by every school in the state.
 
 The three-member committee set up by schools will also provide training to each student about self-defence, especially girls.
 
 During prayers, school administrations have to ensure that children are taught value-based slogans and lives of great people. “The principal should keep track of every incident on the school premises,” added Devnani.
 
 Schools should make students aware of the dangers posed by drugs and ensure they are not easily available nearby.
 
 Teacher should verify that no student is left behind when the school gets over and should not leave the premises even if a single child remains behind in the campus. It is also the duty of a teacher to keep vigil when students go to toilet or washroom, especially if it’s a girl child.
 
 They should also keep watch on sudden changes in behaviour of students and inform and consult parents about them.
