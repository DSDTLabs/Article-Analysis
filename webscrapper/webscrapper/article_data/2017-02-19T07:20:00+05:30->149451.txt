PATIALA: After losing his flying academy, Congress’s former state minister Malkit Singh Birmi may now lose three of its aircrafts, as the state government is planning to auction them for default in payment of dues.

 The state aviation authorities had got Hanger 2 of  , which had been allocated to   in 2004, vacated in May last year. Birmi was allotted the hanger after the Congress government came to power in 2002. At that time, Birmi was a minister and allowed to set up his own academy in Patiala.
 
 He had started the academy with two Cesna 172 planes worth Rs 3 crore each and a Piper Seneca PA-35 worth Rs 8 crore. However, he fell out of favour with the powers that be, and his academy got grounded in 2011.
 
 Birmi Flying Academy ran into controversies one after another, starting with students alleging that they were not being provided adequate flying hours in 2009 and then the Union civil aviation department suspending the approval to it in 2011 after detecting certain irregularities. Students enrolled for commercial pilot licence (CPL) and private pilot licence (PPL) in the academy even took the management to court, following which fees paid by them had to be reimbursed.
 
 In April last year, Punjab   took possession of Hanger 2, as Birmi failed to pay dues totalling Rs 95 lakh to the state government. Soon after, the state government moved court and got evacuation orders against his academy.
 
 Sources said as Birmi could not clear the dues, the state government mooted to auction three aircrafts belonging to the former minister.
 
 A senior official at Punjab State Aviation Council, who did not wish to be named, said the matter was under consideration of the state government and a final decision could be taken only after a new government was formed in the state. “In case Birmi does not clear pending dues, the government will be at liberty to auction his aircrafts and recover the amount,” the official said.
