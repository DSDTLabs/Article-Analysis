 While the minimum going rate is 20,000, a graduate can easily get anywhere between 30,000-35,000. If good looking, a graduate can make 40,000. A more beautiful donor can even command a neat 50,000. 
 
 A peek into the activities of illegal agents reveals that they talk big money to attract the attention of women and coax them to become egg donors.
 
 In fact, female egg donors in the age group of 18-29 willing to go to Mumbai are being promised 20,000, to Bengaluru 25,000 and to Chennai 30,000 by an agent. 
 
 For instance, there is an agent on the lookout for a beautiful egg donor, who is a graduate in the age group of 18-29 years, from Kochi. The price tag: 50,000. All the applicant has to do is first send her photograph to be selected. In another instance, an egg donor is being promised 35,000 in Mumbai. The process of egg retrieval starts after the woman completes her monthly menstrual cycle. "It's okay even if she is menstruating or is on the pill," states another 'wanted' message for a female egg donor whose blood group has to be 'A+'.All female egg donors are required to first send details of their height, weight, blood group, and even their marriage certificate, if they are married. 
 
 Interestingly, in some cases, the female egg donors are also asked to send in not just their pictures but also those of their children. "This is to get an idea if the baby born through IVF using the woman's egg will also be good looking," said a source.
 
 Though the female egg donor remains anonymous and gets paid for her donation, many do not realise that when they fall prey to illegal agents who promise them big money, they can also be left high and dry if there are any complications that crop up during the minor surgery.
