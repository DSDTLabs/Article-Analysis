A biopic on the life of Indian cricket legend Sachin   opened across cinemas in the UK today. 

 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams', the first-of-its-kind Indian docu-drama to get a wide cinema release in Britain, traces the life of Tendulkar from the moment he received a cricket bat as a gift from his elder sister at the age of eight.
 
 "Playing cricket was like going to the temple for me," says Tendulkar in the film, which has been narrated by him. 
 
 London-based director  , a well-known sports documentarian, tracks Tendulkar's journey which led to India's 2011 World Cup victory and his retirement from Test cricket in 2013. 
 
 The film, which has been set to a musical score by Oscar-winning musician A R  , also has previously lesser- known glimpses of the personal life of the 44-year-old cricketing genius who played 200 Test matches in his illustrious career. 
 
 "This film really is the story of the man, and while cricket is a huge part of his life, it is just one chapter," said Erskine. 
 
 Produced by   of 200NotOut, a reference to Tendulkar's record, and Carnival Motion Pictures, the film had premiered in India earlier this week and its cinematic opening in the UK coincides with a worldwide release.
