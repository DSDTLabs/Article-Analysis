BENGALURU : The Indian Space Research Organization (Isro) is all set to launch its 100th indigenous satellite with the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C-40 on January 12 from Sriharikota. 

  Centre (ISAC) director M Annadurai on Tuesday said the PSLV had a very successful turnover up to C-39. While Isro completed its 100th launch in 2012, the C-40 will witness the organization’s 100th indigenous satellite to be rolled out.
 
 “We faced a setback in the 39th mission as it couldn’t release the satellite into the orbit because the heat shield couldn’t open,” Annadurai said at the inauguration of Astrosat exhibition at  . 
 
  
 “We have now understood the reason behind the setback and a lot of tests have been conducted to ensure that such a problem should not repeat again. With C-40, we are back in the game. Thirty-one satellites are being launched, 28 of which are from outside India and three our own,” he added.
 
 The three Indian satellites that will be launched are a nano-satellite weighing less than 5 kg, a microsatellite weighing 100 kg and the 710 kg Cartosat-2 series satellite, the director explained. 
 
 On plans for the year, Annadurai said Chandrayaan-2 was in the final stage of testing and integration of the orbiter, lander and rover, and was expected for launch this year.
 
 Remembering India’s first multi wavelength space observatory
 
 The Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium along with Isro inaugurated the exhibition on Astrosat (India’s first dedicated multi wavelength space observatory). The exhibition will continue for a month at the planetarium and will be open to public from 10.30am to 4.30pm during this period.
 
 The exhibition also boasts of a massive 3D printed model of the satellite which spent two years in orbit after its launch by Isro in 2015. The model, designed by various artists and scientists in the city also includes five payloads of the satellite and is a replica of the original satellite.
