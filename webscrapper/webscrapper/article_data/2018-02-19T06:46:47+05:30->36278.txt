HYDERABAD: Ahead of the state government’s decision to implement   as a mandatory subject for students from class 1 to 12 from the ensuing academic year, parents are jittery about the move in CBSE, ICSE and   schools.

 According to sources, the draft ordinance was referred to the law department on February 12. Once the law department gives its nod, the ordinance will be forwarded to Governor   who is likely to issue the final ordinance by March.
 
  
  
 
 
 Parents argue that they admitted their wards in CBSE, ICSE and IB schools to have Telugu as an optional subject and not mandatory as offered in state-run schools.
 
 With the government set to release an ordinance to introduce Telugu as a mandatory subject, parents have questioned the move fearing their children maybe under immense pressure.
 
 
 “The whole purpose of admitting my children in a CBSE school was to have Telugu as an optional subject. Since they may shift to another state or abroad for further studies, learning the state language will not help them,” said  , a parent.
 
 Parents argue that students should not be forced to learn a new language, when they already have three languages in the curriculum. Many are even confused over its implementation in the upper secondary classes. “My children always learnt a foreign language as the third language and were never acquainted to Telugu. I am afraid that introducing Telugu for new learners in class 5-8 will build immense pressure on them,” said Ranjitha Panuganti, parent of a class 7 student.
 
 While the implementation of the language is yet to be decided, the government appointed a committee headed by   vice-chancellor,   to study the feasibility of the implementation has suggested three levels of learning.
 
 Those having   as their mother tongue will be exempted from learning   as a compulsory subject.
