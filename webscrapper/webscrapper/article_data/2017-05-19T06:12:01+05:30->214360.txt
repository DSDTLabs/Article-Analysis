VADODARA: A casual labourer and his daughter were booked by the Vadodara rural police for trying to kill his wife at   village of   taluka on Wednesday.

 The accused Ranjit Gohil suspected his wife Ramila of having an extramarital affair with a man staying in the same village.
 
 On Wednesday, Gohil had a fight with Ramila over the issue and threatened to kill her. 
 
 Later, Gohil poured kerosene on her while their daughter Saraswati held her and set her ablaze, the police said. The villagers who rushed to their house on hearing Ramila’s screams took her to   where she is undergoing treatment.
 
 Cops have not arrested the two accused since they are verifying Ramila’s version. “Their second daughter told us that Ramila set herself on fire and it was not Gohil and Saraswati who did it. Therefore, after we gather more evidences against the duo we will arrest them,” a police official said.
