LUCKNOW: The investment pledges made at the UP Investors' Summit here earlier this week, pegged at Rs 4.28 lakh crore, is likely to be much higher if investment proposals by various Central ministries were added. 

 Sources in the state government said the initiation of the defence corridor in Bundelkhand by the Centre, railway projects announced by Union railway minister   and IT and electronics minister   have not been added in the total investment proposals declared at the end of the summit.
 
 These projects had been announced earlier and initial work had been undertaken in a few of them.
 
 Sources in the government said that the defence corridor, which would be initiated at a cost of around Rs 20,000 crore, alone would take up the total worth of proposals to Rs 4.48 lakh crore.
 
 The UP government is expecting a total of investment of Rs 1 lakh crore in the initial phases and would open up 30,000 jobs, said sources.
 
 Apart from this, Goyal has announced expansion of   from its existing capacity of 600 bogies to around 3,000 bogies. The capacity enhancement would be done in the next three years, the minister announced.
 
 "The government is now working towards converting the MoUs into actual investment, rather than basking in the glory of a successful event. Had the government added the proposals announced by Union ministers, it would have crossed the Rs 6 lakh-crore mark, said   spokesman Chandramohan.
 
 Goyal also announced a rail refurbishment factory in Jhansi and a rail auxiliary park in Fatehpur..
 
 The long-pending promise of setting up an electric loco shed in Gorakhpur would be taken up on a war-footing, Goyal said. The investment proposed for these projects have also not been added in the Rs 4.28 lakh crore proposals announced.
 
 Announcement by Union IT and electronics minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on two mobile phone giants setting up units worth Rs 6,774 crore has also not been added in the declared proposals.
