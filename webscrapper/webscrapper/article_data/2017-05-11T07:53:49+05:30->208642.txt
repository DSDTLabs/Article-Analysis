JAIPUR: Gearing up for the  , the state   on Wednesday went into ‘chintan’ mode, holding deliberations over the party’s plans for the elections.

 The two-day state BJP’s `chintan shivir’ (thought camp), being held at a private property in Shahpura, is expected to set a path for the preparations for the forthcoming assembly and 2019   polls.
 
 Chief minister   has already set a target for the party’s performance by announcing the Mission 180 plus (for 2018 assembly elections) and Mission 25.
 
 Addressing about 30 senior members of the state unit, Raje on Wednesday said that the party’s aim was not just to win elections but to achieve and secure a position which no political party had attained before. 
 
 “The BJP government in the state has done good work. This has to be conveyed to the voters across all sections to ensure that the party’s performance breaks all previous records,’’ said Raje. 
 
 The BJP in the state had recorded a historic win in 2013 by coming to power with 163 seats. Its present tally in the   is 161.
 
 The state BJP has fast moved into the election mode and speculations are ripe about the changes that the organisation is likely to witness over the next few months. Among other things, the most talked about is the notice issued to senior BJP MLA Ghanshyam Tiwari for anti-party activities. Though Tiwari is yet to receive the notice, to which he has to reply; party sources claim that action against him is likely soon. Speculations over NPP MLA Kirorilal Meena’s `ghar wapse’ to BJP are also ripe, though senior party members claimed that his return to BJP is more difficult than it appears.
