THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP state president   has slammed chief mini ster   for his remark that the word `Hindustan' was a communal interpretation of India.
Taking on the comment by the chief minister during his speech in Mangaluru last week, Rajasekharan in his Facebook post on Monday said Vi jayan's statement reflected his lack of historical understanding. “If he is not aware of the history of Bharat, Pinarayi should at least educate himself on the history of independence of the country . Even Karl Marx in his speeches and writings described Bharat as Hindustan. The name of the Urdu translation of his book `Historic view of  ' is `Hidnustan Ka Tareekhi Khaka,“he said.
 
 “Pinarayi would at least be aware that the name of the organization set up by Netaji   Bose was Azad Hind Fauj. Urdu poet   had sung `Sare Jahan se Accha Hindustan hamara'. Pinarayi should explain whether all those towering personalities were communal,“ said Raja sekharan.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP state general secretary M T Ramesh said Pinarayi was engaged in RSS bashing because he doesn't have answers for the attacks against women and the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
 
 “It was cheap on the part of the CM to use the assembly as a platform to attack BJP . Pinarayi should introspect to find out what led to the plight of the Indian communist party that began the political work during the same period as RSS,“ he said.
