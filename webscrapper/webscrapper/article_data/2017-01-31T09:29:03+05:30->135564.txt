 On Sunday, in his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' address to the nation, Modi said students and their families should look at 
  and not as a source of stress.
 
 "My view is that examination is a celebration. Take it as if it is a festival. And when there is a festival or celebration, then the best comes out of us. We feel the society's strength during celebrations. Whatever is the best comes out," he said.
 
 "Smile more to score more" and don't take it as "test of life", the PM said.
 
 "Examinations should be a source of happiness. It should be seen as an opportunity to highlight all the hard work you have done in a year. There should be enthusiasm and zest. It is your decision to treat as a pleasure or pressure. Those who treat it as a pleasure will gain and those who treat it as pressure will repent," the PM warned.
 
 The PM also cited the example of late President A PJ  's failure in an air force recruitment examination. Had Kalam accepted it as a defeat, then India would not have got such a great scientist and President, Modi reminded students.
