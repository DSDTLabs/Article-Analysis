Margao: Director general of police Muktesh Chander, on Saturday, strongly advocated the need for strengthening electronic surveillance system in the state. 

 “I have (put before) the authorities that more and more CCTV cameras are needed all over   at public places like important markets, for surveillance, crime prevention and detection… I have asked for more cameras to be installed and in cases where they are found to be non-functional, to get them repaired,” Chander said. 
 
 He conceded that the absence of CCTV cameras impeded police investigations in the recent cases of   while addressing reporters after the arrest of Francis Pereira, the accused in desecration cases. 
 
 “If we had several such CCTV cameras in places like Curchorem, Margao and other places where desecration incidents happened, we could have solved this case much earlier,” Chander said. 
 
 Chief minister Manohar Parrikar also seemed to agree with Chander on this count, while speaking to reporters. 
 
 TOI had in its Friday edition highlighted how police investigations in the case were hampered due to lack of CCTV footage, as there were no CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the crime scenes, and in some cases where there were, they were found to be non-functional. 
 
 “My request to keepers of religious places, resident welfare associations, petrol pumps, market associations, business establishments, banks, and even individual households to install CCTV camera systems in their premises for their own safety and to help the police. The cost of CCTV cameras has now come down, and one can get a system installed within Rs 20,000,” Chander said. 
 
 Vouching for the efficacy of the electronic surveillance system as an investigative tool, Chander said, “The utility of CCTV cameras has been established all over the world. Major cities in many countries have CCTV cameras.”
