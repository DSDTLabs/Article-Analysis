CHANDIGARH: Claiming he is a victim of political vendetta, former   chief minister   on Tuesday denied any wrong doing in the Manesar land deal in which he was questioned by the   on Monday.

 Hooda was questioned by a CBI team for around nine hours on Monday in Chandigarh. There are allegations of loss of around Rs 1,500 crore with private real estate owners buying around 400 acres of land in connivance with public officials under the threat of forcible land acquisition between August 27, 2004 and August 24, 2007. The CBI had registered the case in September 2015.
 
 “I have said this earlier too that political vendetta is being unleashed against me,” said Hooda on being questioned about allegations of re-allotment of a plot to Associated Journals Limited (AJL) in   in 2005. Hooda said the Haryana BJP government released 3,600 acres of land in   that too after announcement of award for the land but the state government is silent on the issue.
 
 “Truth will come out. I have not allotted the land to anyone. We did not acquire anything. As regards their allegation that private builders conspired with unidentified officials of the Haryana government to purchased the land, let them make the names of the officials public,” said Hooda.
 
 Taking a dig at the ruling BJP, Hooda said the government ‘deserved credits’ only for frequent transfer of officials, indulging in vendetta politics against opponents and renaming existing schemes and cities.
