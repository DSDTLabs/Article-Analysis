 returns to television after a gap of ten years with family drama  .
 
  
 
  
 
  
  The show is about twin sisters who are married to two half-brothers and live under the same roof. In spite of the fact that they are twins there is nothing common between them.
  
  Vani is a strong minded career woman while Rani is a demure housewife. Being a perfectionist, Tanvi Azmi wants the characters to be as close to reality as possible.
  
  While most television actors have stylists and flaunt designer labels, Tanvi Azmi is going against the tide for the portrayal of Vani and Rani.
  
  A source from the set reveals, â€œThe saris which she dons for both the characters are not from any designer. She likes to keep it simple and real"
  
  Vani Rani will air from 7th August.
