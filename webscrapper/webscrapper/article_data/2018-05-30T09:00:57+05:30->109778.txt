WASHINGTON: Scientists have sent broccoli seeds coated with a healthy dose of good bacteria to space in a quest to find a viable way for astronauts at the   ( ) to grow their own vegetables — and possibly one day on the Moon or  .

 
 Six broccoli seeds were aboard the   spacecraft that launched this week from Wallops Island, Virginia, as part of a space station cargo resupply mission.
 
 Three of the seeds are coated with two different species of bacteria, developed at the University of  , that can live inside crop plants and improve their growth.
 
 The goal of the experiment, conducted by students at Valley Christian High School in California, is to learn how to grow vegetables in the challenging, microgravity conditions of the ISS — and on the Moon and Mars — as human space exploration expands.
