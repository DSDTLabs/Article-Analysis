BATHINDA: AAP activist   on Tuesday ended his   the   of Faridkot cooperative   to Bhogpur in Jalandhar after Punjab health minister   assured him to take up the matter in the state cabinet.

 After lengthy parleys in the day, Mohindra succeeded in convincing Sekhon to break his fast.
 
 Mohindra said the state government would discuss the matter in the next cabinet meet where he would advocate keeping the sugar mill at Faridkot. Sekhon, however, threatened to start the fast again if the state government did not accept his demands.
 
 On Monday, Sekhon had started the fast after nearly 10 days of the protest against the shifting of machinery of the sugar mill to Bhogpur. The Faridkot sugar mill was closed in 2006 after it had gone into losses and thereafter plantation of sugarcane had stopped in the area. In 2016, the state cabinet had decided to permanently close the mill.
