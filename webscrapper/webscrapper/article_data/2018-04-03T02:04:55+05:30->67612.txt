NEW DELHI: A day after arresting two teachers of a   school and a   in the same area for allegedly leaking the   Class XII Economics questions,   questioned the principal of the same school for nearly three hours on Monday after it came to light that the leaked question paper had reached the exam centre (the Bawana school) two hours before March 26 test, in a gross violation of protocol. 

 A CBSE official who was suspended on Sunday for laxity in supervision at the exam centre would also be quizzed on Tuesday.
 
 Interrogations revealed that the accused might have been involved in leaking CBSE question papers earlier too, police sources said. Cops are not discounting the role of a syndicate involving some Board officials. The possibility of other question papers having been leaked this year has also not been ruled out.
 
 The Delhi crime branch is also focusing on the module that leaked the Class X   questions. The paper was circulated in four WhatsApp groups each comprising more than 60 members each.
