 “The timetable for the Harbour services up to Goregaon has not yet been finalized,” said a railway official, adding that nearly one lakh commuters will benefit from the extension. Around 10 lakh commuters travel on Harbour trains. “Initially, there will be a few token services up to Goregaon—not more than four services may be extended from Andheri up to Goregaon in the first phase. Later, all CSMT-Andheri services may be extended up to Goregaon.” The   will also benefit Western Railway as a few slow trains will ply on the Harbour line tracks between Andheri and Goregaon to improve punctuality.
 
 All 91 CSMT-Andheri services may be extended in phases, sources said. Currently, there are 18 services between Panvel and Andheri and these too may be extended up to Goregaon gradually.
 
 Sources said Harbour services originating from Andheri may soon be scrapped, but a final call is yet to be taken. “Commuters will not be affected as the trains will halt at Andheri,” an official said. But sources pointed out that terminating or originating services at Andheri may result in trains crossing tracks, which could affect punctuality. 
 
 Meanwhile, the army FOBs at Elphinstone Road, Currey Road and Ambivli are near completion, said sources. The army was roped in to build the bridges after the Elphinstone Road FOB stampede on September 29, which had claimed 23 lives. Sources said a function is likely to be held for the inauguration and railway minister Piyush Goyal, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis are expected to turn up.
