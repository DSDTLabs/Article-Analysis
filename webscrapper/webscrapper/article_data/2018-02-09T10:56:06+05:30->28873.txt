 This is the third summons issued to Kavlekar. He has moved the principal sessions court seeking anticipatory bail. The application has been fixed for hearing on Monday. 
 
 The Quepem MLA submitted to the court that his summoning just before the commencement of the assembly session on February 19 was a bid to influence and prevent him from creating any problems for the government in power. Kavlekar stated that he feared he could be arrested without any reason if he didn’t cooperate with the investigation. He also stated that he was unnecessarily being implicated under provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, which were not applicable in the present case. 
 
 Kavlekar had skipped the first summons asking him to be present on February 5. In his letter, he stated that it was his constitutional duty to attend the upcoming legislative assembly session, and as such, sought time till March 21 to appear before the branch. The ACB later issued the second summons for February 10. Kavlekar said that he would not be able to attend the same as he has a medical check-up. Later, Kavlekar informed the ACB that he would be available this week for questioning.
