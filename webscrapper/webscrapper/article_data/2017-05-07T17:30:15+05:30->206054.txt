  She described in her caption how Mouni took good care of her daughter. Teejay wrote, "So I wake up on my second day in Bombay and wonder, 'What does a baby do around here?' All the people I know are in Canada. I guess I better go meet some new people. :) So I head over to my Daddy's shoot. He does a show about snakes. But I didn't see any. It's good because I'm scared of snakes!"
  
  "I met Mouni Masi. :) She's really nice. And really pretty. She sings me songs in Bengali. :) She says she will teach me Bengali. Mouni Maashi. See? I'm learning already! :) It was really hot today. My maashi got me AC cooler so I would be comfortable. It's great being a baby. Everyone takes care of me. :) Still, it's a little too warm. And I'm tired. I better go home before I start crying. If I make too much noise, the snakes might come out. I'll see you again soon @imouniroy! There. I met one new person today,” she added.
  
  
  
  
  Karanvir and Teejay have been married for more than 10 years now, and the couple has now completed their family with the two beautiful daughters coming into their lives.
