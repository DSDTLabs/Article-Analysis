Chandigarh: Police arrested the sister of a historysheeter for her alleged role in the murder of a youth from Madina village in Sonipat district on March 22. Kavita Singh alias Geeta, sister of Pawan Kumar alias Pawna, was arrested on Friday night after he along with his associates Seeta and two others had shot dead one Rajesh Singh.

 Pawan had attacked Rajesh (18) and his accomplice Sawan when they were sitting in the lawns of government model senior secondary school in Madina. Barauda station house officer (SHO) Veer Bhan, who is also the investigating officer in the case, confirmed Pawan’s sister Kavita was arrested on Friday night. On Saturday, she was produced before the court, which remanded her to judicial custody.
 
 “In fact, Kavita had come to Madina last month to attend marriage. She also had some tiff with Rajesh’s family. She provoked Pawan to settle scores and kill Rajesh as well. Pawan is a history sheeter and has been serving life sentence for a murder in Rohtak. He had come out on parole in September 2017 and murdered Rajesh’s elder brother Rakesh Singh. We are conducting raids to arrest Pawan and Seeta and their two accomplices as well,” said SHO Veer.
 
 Alleging police inaction, kin of Rajesh blocked the Madina-Sonipat road and were booked and arrested by Sonipat police. Rajesh’s father Jai Singh alleged that despite repeated complaints made at Barauda police station, cops had failed to act against Kavita and Pawan.
