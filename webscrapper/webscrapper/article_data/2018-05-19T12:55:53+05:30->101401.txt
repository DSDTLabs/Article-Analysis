 VMC medical officer Dr Devesh Patel said that the new plant was called ‘whole animal shredder’ as the new plant coming up at Gajrawadi will shred the carcasses into very small shreds. The shreds can directly be used for composting in the existing plant to prepare manure.
 
 The civic body had invited bids for the project on three occasions. On the third occasion, two vendors came forward with bids. The agency installing the shredder will also maintain it for three years. The civic body will spend Rs 1.33crore on setting up the plant. Also, an expense of Rs 99lakh will be made every month towards operations and maintenance of the plant.
 
 The sanitation workers who are presently employed in the process of skinning the carcasses and removing their bones will now be roped in for the plant. Officials said that their employment will thus be protected.
