Bieber fever has gripped the nation, as the clock ticks down to the big   Purpose World Tour India. The pop sensation will be making his maiden trip to the country for his upcoming gig in Mumbai. While the show organisers are going overboard to meet his ‘unBeliebable’ demands, fans, on the other hand, are gearing up to witness the spectacle for the first time on home soil.

 One superstar who seems to have caught the fever that is plaguing the city is none other than  . The Sri-Lankan beauty, who will turn tour guide for the pop sensation while he’s in the city, is apparently having a hard time concentrating on her ‘Judwaa 2’ shoot. Don’t take our word for it? Then this video shared by her co-star   will support these claims.
 
 Varun, who will be paired up with Jacky for the second time on-screen, shared a video from the film sets that saw the actress singing and dancing to Justin’s ‘Baby’. The clip sees the annoyed actor approaching Jacky and asking her to get her head back in the game and concentrate on shooting their song ‘Oonchi Hai Building’.
 
 To see if his playful scolding paid off, watch the video below:
