ROPAR: It was only after the results were announced that the family of Charanjit Singh Channi, who contested the polls from Chamkaur Sahib assembly constituency, let out a collective sigh of relief. Channi, the   (CLP) leader, had managed to retain the seat.

 “We were a little apprehensive as the Aam Aadmi Party had fielded a candidate with the same name. But, all is well that ends well,” said Kamaljit Kaur, Channi’s wife. 
 
 Accompanied by Channi’s sister Surender Kaur and other relatives, Kamaljit was closely monitoring the poll information filtering out from the counting centres. “We did not really have any with the Akali candidate (Nirmal Singh) from our constituency,” she said. 
 
 Channi defeated his namesake candidate from AAP by 12,308 votes. SAD candidate Justice Nirmal Singh (retd) finished third.
 
 Channi is among two of the three Congress candidates who got elected from three assembly constituencies of Ropar district. Rana K P Singh won from Anandpur Sahib, after defeating Dr Parminder Sharma of BJP-SAD alliance by a huge margin of 23,881 votes. 
 
 Rana was declared elected much before noon. Attributing his victory to the hard work of his supporters and party, he said, “People were desperately waiting for the elections. This mandate clearly shows that the electorate has found Congress as the only option against SAD and BJP.” 
 
 Meanwhile, heavy police arrangements were made around the counting centres. More than 200 cops, including SP and DSP level officers, were deployed along with civil staff. The area of 50m around the centres was declared out of bounds for the common men till counting was in progress.
