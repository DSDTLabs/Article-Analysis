 voted on Sunday after the state saw its first high-decible campaign following  's spirited bid to overturn the 25-year-old Left regime.

 The BJP campaign was led by PM Modi and votes were sought in his name. His cutouts and posters were all over Agartala and elsewhere. The ground work was done under the leadership of Sunil Deodhar, BJP's in-charge for the state, and the local poster boy was Biplab Deb, the state party chief. However, BJP sources are not sure who will be the CM if they win as the party has not declared a name. According to the local buzz, Sudip Rai Burman, who moved over from Congress, could be a strong claimant for the post.
 
 Congress has little hopes of winning but will cut into non-Left votes and end up hurting BJP. Party functionaries acknowledge that most of BJP's strength has been "borrowed" from Congress as BJP had little presence in the state. BJP's failed attempt to woo Tripura royal   robbed the party of a face to match the stature of CM Manik Sarkar. BJP's pledge "chalo paltai" (Let's change) has also overthrown the usual "quiet, inexpensive" ways of campaigning in Tripura and replaced it with an overpowering audio-visual campaign - from Agartala to the interiors of Kamalasagar constituency, where a barbed wire marks border between India and Bangladesh. In stark contrast,  's face could not be spotted on any poster or banner, even as his party is confident of romping home. From January 23 to February 16, the CM addressed over 50 public meetings.
 
 BJP put everything into the campaign. Modi addressed two rallies initially and was back for two more on the last day. Party chief Amit Shah addressed five rallies, two roadshows and a press meet.
