CHENNAI: Mystery shrouds the death of a Class X student from   on Thursday. 

 While the family claimed she collapsed a couple of minutes after consuming samosas and soft drinks, police on suspicion have sent her body for postmortem to ascertain the cause of death. 
 
 The victim - Gayathri, 15 - was studying in a private school and was found   at her house. 
 
 Police have sent her body to Government   where doctors said the girl had ligature marks around her neck.
 
 The Neelankarai police said the girl's family refused to give her body for postmortem as they wanted to complete the final rites. 
 
 "However, they registered a case and sent it for autopsy after a few neighbours claimed she may have committed suicide," said an investigating officer.
 
 "The exact reason will be known only after the autopsy report is out," he said.
