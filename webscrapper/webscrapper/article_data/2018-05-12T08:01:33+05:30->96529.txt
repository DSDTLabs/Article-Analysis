CHANDIGARH: After reports emerged that   co-owner   had a fall-out with team mentor   after the side’s recent loss against  , the franchise on Friday disproved the allegations and stated there wasn’t any spat between the two.

 
 
 
 “The culture in Kings XI is one that is open and non-hierarchical, and is one which encourages open and frank debate by one and all across all levels with the common goal of continuous improvement,” a statement from Kings XI read. 
 
 Zinta had earlier taken to Twitter and denied having a verbal altercation with Sehwag. Kings XI also specified that the team reviews its performance through formal and informal discussions.
 
 “This (statement) is in response to media reports that have been published in the last couple of days on the supposed disagreement which was reported after Kings XI’s last game. The stories have led to a lot of speculation and we at Kings XI Punjab would like to clearly state that as part of our management process, (as well as other franchisees) we review our performance on and off the field after each game through both, formal and informal discussions,” the team said.
 
 “This is part of our standard operations review process which helps us to analyse our results and allow us to focus on the improvement required after each game, both on and off the field so that we can continue to improve in all aspects,” the statement further added.
