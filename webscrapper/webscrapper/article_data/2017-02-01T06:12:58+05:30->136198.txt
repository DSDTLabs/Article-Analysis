NASHIK: Hundreds of participants of the   gathered at three important junctions of the city and blocked traffic for some time on Tuesday. 

 They staged agitations at Dwarka, Adgaon and Sinnar Phata area, which affected movement of vehicles for some time on the Mumbai Agra highway and the Nashik-Pune highway, on Tuesday. The Maratha community had organised similar agitations across the state to press for reservations in jobs, among other demands. 
 
 A huge police force was deployed at all the three agitation spots to prevent any untoward incident. The police said they had detained over 100 activists from the agitation sites. The agitators were released later. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Srikant Dhivare said they held a meeting with the activists, who were leading the agitation, on Monday. “They were issued strict instruction that any kind of violence would lead to arrests. They would have to remain behind bars till the civic polls are completed. Apart from this, notices were also issued to over 200 people warning them against committing any cognizable offence,” he added.
 
 The road blockade in Nashik Road lasted for about 10 minutes. The huge posse of the police and activists present along the Nashik-Pune highway near Sinnar Phata, however, instilled a feeling of concern among motorists and citizens passing through the area. 
 
 DCP (Zone I) Laxmikant Patil said, “We had to detain some 100 people at Adgaon. The agitation at Dwarka lasted for 10 minutes, while the one at Adgaon lasted for nearly half-an-hour from 11.15 am to 11.45 am.”
 
 The police said that there were around 20 to 25 activists in the Dwarka area. However, nearly 1,500 had gathered to block the road at Adgaon. The police had to divert the traffic to other roads to prevent congestion. Nonetheless, motorists on the highway did get stuck for nearly 25 minutes on the highway.
