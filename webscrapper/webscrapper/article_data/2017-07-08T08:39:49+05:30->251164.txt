THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Poultry traders in the state claimed that it was the slump in production of poultry that led to the hike in price of chicken and not the introduction of GST. They said that they had conveyed this issue to finance minister T M   in a meeting held to discuss the issue on Thursday. 

 According to  , it is the weather conditions in Tamil Nadu that has resulted in poor poultry production, indirectly affecting prices in Kerala.
 
 Kerala produces only 30% of its poultry requirement. In the past one-and-a-half months, the highest price of poultry at farms was Rs 117, in wholesale it was Rs 127 and in retail, Rs 145.
 
 "It is wrong to say that we increased prices with the introduction of GST. The actual reason is the low production in Tamil Nadu due water scarcity and apprehensions among farmers about GST. After incurring transportation and labour charges, we take a margin of Rs 8 to Rs 9 from the wholesale and retail prices. Though finance minister has asked us to reduce the price, it will not be practical," said the association's joint secretary M Kavikumar.
 
 Meanwhile, representatives of the   said that it was a temporary hike in price and it will stabilize in next two weeks.
 
 "With an increase in production, the prices will come down in next two to three weeks. Due to festival demands and in their haste to clear stocks before the introduction of GST, the farmers had sold the chickens early. The chicken sold during this period weighed around 1kg whereas it should have been nearly 2.8kg normally. Even, the price of chicks which was Rs 25 in farms, had increased to Rs 52 in retail due to the crisis," said  , the federation's president.
