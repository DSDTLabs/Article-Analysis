MUMBAI: In a first, a deaf-blind student will appear for the Class X examination through the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). While the   Institute of the   and Deaf-Blind had petitioned the board to provide question papers in Braille, the board has only allowed him to appear with help from a writer and interpreter.

 Sourabh Chougale (21) is one of three deaf-blind students from the institute appearing for the   from the state board for the first time. “Had they been able to arrange for papers in Braille, it would have given them more confidence. But after a lot of interaction with the board we have been able to use his subject teachers as interpreters. He will use tactical sign language to tell us the answers and we will dictate them to the writer,” said Devyani Hadkar, coordinator at the institute.
 
 Two students have a slight functional vision and hence can read the question papers but Chougale is 100% deaf-blind. He hails from Sangli but resides at the institute’s hostel in Mahape. “Now that permission is in place, he is excited but stressed. We plan to call his parents to Mumbai so he can have their company during the papers,” said Hadkar. For Chougale, the exams will begin mathematics on March 14.
 
 “We could not provide Braille papers and usually do not allow acquaintances to help the student during the exam but since this is a genuine case, we have allowed it this time,” said Siddheshwar Chandekar, secretary, Mumbai division.
