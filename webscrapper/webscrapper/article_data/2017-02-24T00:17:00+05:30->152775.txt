INDORE:   on Wednesday reprimanded a police station in-charge and a constable from Mhow for failing to furnish necessary documents during a hearing into the election petition against BJP leader   and said the court is not helpless before small town police officers.

 Justice Alok Verma, while hearing the petition on Wednesday, also said the court might ignore or even delete the necessity of a certificate needed in the trial, which is not being provided by the police officers.
 
 SHO of Mhow’s police station Dinesh Singh Chouhan had been directed by the court to give a certificate under section 65B, stating that he had made copies of the CD with a video of the Moharram incident.
 
 Chouhan in his affidavit said that he had asked a constable at the police station to make copies of those CDs and since the certificate under section 65B can only be filed by the person who copied the CDs, he could not submit the said certificate. The constable in his affidavit told the court, that he too did not make copies of the CDs and instead had asked a local shop owner to do it, who is now dead.
 
 “The court on hearing these contentions expressed that ‘We are not helpless, we know the what kind of game you are playing. We have ample power and can also ignore or delete the requirement of the certificate,” Vibhor Khandelwal, counsel to the petitioner   said.
 
 An order regarding the necessity of the certificate is awaited. Meanwhile, another affidavit was submitted in court by executive engineer regarding the pre-feasibility report of the metro rail project for Indore. It has been stated in the affidavit that in 2013, a pre-feasibility report had been prepared and is in existence. Also,  , Vijayvargiya’s representative in Mhow, has submitted an application before the court seeking to be examined in the petition. The court is yet to decide on this application.
