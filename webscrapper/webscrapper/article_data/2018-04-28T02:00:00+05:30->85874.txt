PATNA: As part of its three-day anti-encroachment drive, the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has removed encroachers from congested areas of the city, such as Bari Path, Rajendra Nagar and Nala Road. The drive, carried out in presence of police personnel, concluded on Friday.

 Acting on a Patna high court order to remove encroachments from around NIT-Patna, the PMC had started the anti-encroachment drive from Ashok Rajpath in Bankipore circle on Wednesday.
 
 On the first day, the PMC collected Rs 5,000 as fine and seized a stone chip-laden tractor near NIT-Patna Mor. On the second day, Rs 15,000 was collected as fine and three tractors were seized between Hathua Market and Bikhna Pahari.
 
 Executive officer of Bankipore Circle Abdul Hamid said encroachments on both sides of Nala Road, including illegal dhabas, were removed during the drive. “Juice stalls, illegal hoardings, generators placed on the pavement outside the shops and unauthorized extensions of shops were also demolished. The officials have also confiscated goods and other stuff kept by shopkeepers on the roads,” Hamid added.
 
 “We have urged the local police stations to depute constables at Bari Path, Bakerganj, Nala Road, Shivpur and near Prem Chand Rangshala to prevent return of encroachers. Another anti-encroachment drive will be carried out next month,” Hamid said.
 
 He added de-silting of manholes in Bankipore Cirle was also in the progress. “We have covered 10 sewerages in Bakerganj locality in two days with the help of super-suction machine. Altogether 140 manholes under Bankipore circle will be covered within a month,” he said.
