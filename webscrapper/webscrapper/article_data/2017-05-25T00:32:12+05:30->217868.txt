New Delhi: Following the footsteps of the NDMC, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has declared major   falling under its jurisdiction as open defecation free (ODF). Commissioner of south corporation Puneet Kumar Goel on Tuesday chaired a meeting with the sanitation department and passed a resolution declaring 92 of its 104 wards as ODF.

 Goel stated that the civic body will soon issue a public notice to invite feedback, suggestions and objections from the residents of these 92 wards. “In case there are no objections,   will announce its final resolution for further transmission to the state government,” he added.
 
 In the concerned wards, SDMC claims that it has been able to provide access to either an individual toilet or a community toilet within 500 meters from every settlement. It has also ensured that all commercial areas in the wards have access to public toilets within a distance of 1 km.
