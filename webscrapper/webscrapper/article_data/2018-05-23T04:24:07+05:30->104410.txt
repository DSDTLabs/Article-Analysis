MUMBAI: The   here questioned the selective outrage over a letter by Archbishop of Delhi Anil   urging Catholics to “pray for the country” ahead of the 2019 general election. 

 Couto, who had referred to the “turbulent political atmosphere which poses a threat to democratic principles... and the secular fabric of our nation”, had urged Catholics to pray and fast every Friday till the election. 
 
 Fr Nigel Barrett, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Bombay, said, “It is unfortunate that so much is (being) read into the letter. It is a normal practice in the Church to pray for our elected leaders and to pray for free and peaceful elections. 
 
 The archbishop has done just that.” “I think people have misread the words that say ‘looking forward... to a new government’. After an election, whoever wins forms a new government at the Centre. The letter does not say to pray for a change in government, as is being reported. 
 
 It is unfortunate that a few media houses have blown it out of proportion and tried to polarise people on religious lines.” When TOI interviewed Mumbai archbishop   before the 2014 polls, he advised Catholics to give “good governance” a chance over “secularism”. 
 
 Good governance was the   slogan at that time, and no political party had objected then.   D’Souza, parish priest of St Jude’s Church in Malad, said, “Critics are viewing this letter with a distorted perception. 
 
 It is not holding a brief for  .” Fr Warner, like archbishop Couto, said that the letter voices the opinion of ordinary citizens.
