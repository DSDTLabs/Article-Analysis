VARANASI: Union textiles minister   rephrased UP CM  's campaign slogan 'Kaam Bolta Hai to Kaarnama Bolta Hai' as she went on to present contents of comptroller and auditor general (CAG) reports shedding light on the rise in crime against women in UP during Samajwadi Party ruling. She highlighted the coincidence of polling and International Women's Day falling on the same day, March 8 and urged women to exercise their right to franchise while choosing candidate wisely. 

 During an interaction with newsmen on Friday, she said, "SP-led Akhilesh Yadav government came up with a slogan ' Kaam bolta hai (work speaks) and befooled the public of the state in Assembly elections with this one sentence. Today, I wish to put forth a few ' kaarname' (deeds) of the home department which CM has kept with himself." 
 
 Attributing dearth of police force as reason for worsening crime scenario in the state, Irani said, "CAG scrutiny shows in 2016, FIRs were only lodged in 11 cases after orders from apex court."
