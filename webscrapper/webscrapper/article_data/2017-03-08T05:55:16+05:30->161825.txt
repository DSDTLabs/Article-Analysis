AHMEDABAD: Even before Prime Minister   landed in his hometown, leaders of the   (AAP) including a woman leader and members of the Hardik Patel-led   (PAAS) were detained by the cops on Tuesday morning.

 Protesters from various communities and groups are set to press their demands before the PM, who will address a meeting of sarpanchs on Wednesday.
 
 Police sources said they had intelligence that groups linked to Alpesh Thakor will try to block roads in Gandhinagar by felling trees or setting tyres on fire, and local police personnel have been instructed to stop this by detaining his associates in advance.
 
 Vandana Patel, an AAP leader, was taken into detention from her house in the Vastral area in the wee hours of Tuesday and was taken to Odhav police station. Harshil Nayak, AAP spokesperson, said Patel was picked by police late at night which was against the law and was detained for some 12 hours.
 
 “Apart from Vandanaben, some ten party workers from Vadodara were put under house arrest and ten party workers from Bharuch were detained by police on Tuesday evening,” Nayak said.
 
 Alpesh Thakor, convener of OBC, SC, ST Ekta Manch and Gujarat Kshatriya Thakor Sena, said he will lead a protest march of anganwadi workers and Asha workers from Sabarmati Ashram in Vadaj to Gandhinagar, where the PM will be addressing the meeting of women sarpanchs.
 
 “When anaganwadi and Asha workers tied rakhis to Narendrabhai when he was CM, he had said that these workers are like Yashoda Maiya who took care of Lord Krishna like his own mother. Now, these women seek their wages and the PM should give them justice,” Thakor said in a statement on Tuesday.
