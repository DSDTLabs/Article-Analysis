GURGAON: It’s been   that the general hospital at   has been operating without the fire department’s clearance, risking several lives. On an average, 2,500 people visit the hospital, excluding the indoor patients and staff, a day. The no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department expired in March 2016. 

 What’s more, instead of updating the system or taking punitive action, the hospital administration and the city’s fire department are busy passing the buck. While the fire department has reiterated that an NOC will be issued only after the firefighting system is updated, the hospital staff are awaiting the budget to update the same. A reminder was sent to the hospital by the fire department in November 2016, but to no avail. The   falls under the ‘hospital less than 15 metres in height with plot area more than 1000 square metre’ category. Under this it requires a fire extinguisher every 15 metres, hose reel, wet riser, yard hydrant, manually operated electric fire alarm system, automatic detection and alarm system, underground static water storage tank and terrace tank. 
 
 “They have to apply for the NOC. After that we will conduct an inspection to check if all equipment is in place and functional. They haven’t reverted to reminders,” said I S  , senior fire official.
 
 Sources said the hospital’s apathetic attitude was because of old system which should be revamped. Around six months ago, the ringman (red pipes) on the outer side of the hospital’s building started leaking, resulted in rusting.
