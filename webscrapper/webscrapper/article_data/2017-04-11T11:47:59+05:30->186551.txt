NAGPUR: The   Special Task Force (STF) for wildlife nabbed three dreaded tiger poachers wanted in poaching cases in Melghat.

 The three accused were among nine persons nabbed by assistant conservator of forests (ACF)   and his STF team from Unchehara, a small town in   district on Sunday.
 
 The accused were absconding since 2013, when large-scale tiger poaching cases rocked the region. The trio has been identified as Rokin Jer Patlepawar, Tilia Naret Pardhi and Tyohari Naret Pardhi, all belonging to the Baheliya community from Katni.
 
 “We had information about some other cases against tje accused and luckily stumbled upon them. All the three are wanted in tiger poaching cases in Melghat and Nagpur,” said a senior MP official.
 
 The accused were brought to Jabalpur where the MP STF handed over the accused to CBI, which is investigating tiger poaching cases in Nagpur. The   obtained transit warrant and shifted the accused to Nagpur late night. A forest team each from Melghat and Nagpur is also accompanying the accused. Till filing of the report, the accused had not reached Nagpur.
 
 According to forest department sources, all the accused will be produced before the court to seek forest custody remand (FCR) for detailed investigations.
 
 All the three were most wanted among the other poachers. Till now the forest department has arrested at least 40 poachers. Of these, at least 20 are still in jail, serving their term. Others have been released after completing their sentence.
 
 The three poachers were involved in hunting tigers in Masondi in Melghat and also trafficking skins and body parts from Amdi Fata near Ramtek.
 
 However, three hardcore poachers — Luchi, Bharo and Keru — are still at large. “Their arrest would throw more light on poaching cases,” said officials.
