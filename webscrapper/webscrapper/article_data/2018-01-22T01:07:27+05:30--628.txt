 Over the next few days, property-related services provided by the estate office of Huda will be done online, for which Huda has made Aadhaar card mandatory.
 
 All plot owners in Huda sectors have been given login credentials, which need to be linked with their Aadhaar card, mobile number and email ID registered with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
 
 “People are requested to update their Aadhaar-linked mobile number and email ID with online property account, for transparent service,” said Huda estate officer Vivek Kalia. 
 
 He added that for services related to property, plot holders will have to login into an official portal, after which they will receive a one time password (OTP) on their cell phone registered with UIDAI.
 
 Doing away with a manual and cumbersome process for reselling and mortgaging of plots in its sectors, Huda online system will be introduced this week, ofiicials said. 
 
 The entire process of each of the services provided will now be now completed within four days.
 
 Around 32 property-related services are listed under the citizen’s charter, with 1-2 weeks fixed for completion of each of them. 
 
 In the first phase, Huda will be providing four services — getting transfer permits, re-allotment letter, mortgage and de-mortgage.
 
 Officials said that usually, the login ID and password of plot owners are used by a third party, which will not be possible anymore. 
 
 “Only plot owners can apply for the above mentioned services, as the OTP will be sent to their mobile number,” said the official, adding that this is expected to reduce the role of agents and check corruption.
