 contestants,   and   Gurjjar have always shared cold vibes on the show. The two have got into various ugly fights especially during tasks. Something similar happened once again during the captaincy task between   and  .
 
  
 
  
  As reported earlier, Swami Om has been thrown out of the Bigg Boss house for throwing his pee on Bani and Rohan. However, the fight between Rohan and Manveer took place while Swami Om was in the house. This is what actually happened, Bigg Boss introduced the captaincy task between Swami Om and Bani. Two pyramids of miniature blocks with Bani and Om Swami’s pictures on it were placed in the garden area. A border circle was made and the rest of the housemates were asked to aim and displace the blocks of the contestant they don’t want to support with the help of squishy balls. They had to do this by staying outside the border.
  
  Rohan starts targeting Swami Om’s blocks and also displaces his blocks aggressively. He also targets the ones that had fallen down. Moreover, he also instigates other inmates to do the same. After watching this, Manveer, who was made the sanchalak of the task gets annoyed and asks Rohan to focus on the game and to not target Swami Om. Rohan tells Manveer that he has all the rights to support Bani and destroy Swami Om’s blocks and continues with his actions. Looking at Rohan’s aggressiveness, Manu also gets involved and they all have a yelling match.
  
  Is Rohan being unnecessarily being targeted by Manveer and Manu?
