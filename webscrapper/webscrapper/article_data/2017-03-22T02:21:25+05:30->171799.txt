NEW DELHI: A day after a man was thrashed to death on the suspicion of being a thief, the family of the victim told the police that he was   unstable and had been undergoing treatment for the past three years.

 Four men identified as Andip, Subhash, Anoop and Harender were arrested for murder and destruction of evidence. They told the police that they had found the man, Shankar, loitering around their haystack godown in Swaroop Nagar. Suspecting him to be a thief, the men had confronted him. But Shankar was agitated and started abusing them. A scuffle ensued during which the four tied Shankar to a tractor and kept thrashing him until he stopped breathing. 
 
 “The area where Shankar was roaming around was notorious for thefts. The accused have told us that several car batteries and other items had been stolen, so when they spotted him, they suspected that he was stealing something,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Later, the men dragged the body 400 metres away and dumped it in an open field.
 
 The next morning, Shankar’s sister, Manju, heard about a man’s body lying in the field. When she went out to check, she was horrified to find that it was her brother lying dead. 
 
 “Manju told us about his condition. Later, she also provided several documents detailing his medical condition. We are looking into the documents to verify her claims,” said the officer, adding that the assailants have been charged for murder and destruction of evidence.
