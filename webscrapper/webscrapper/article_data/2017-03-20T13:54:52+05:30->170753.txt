Director   has already started working on his next film, Good Night City, starring  , Ritwick Chakraborty and   in the lead.

 Talking about the subject of his film, Kamaleswar said, “In the past few years, we have heard of many cases of psychological disorder -from Partha Dey case to Udayan Das, Darbara Singh, Amardeep Sada to Akku Yadav case -that led to social bedlam like murder, rape, suicide etc. I had been researching on the subject for the past two years. A research team comprising Dr Srimanti Chaudhury and Rana Mukherjee have assisted me in developing the story of the film. We wanted to keep it as authentic as possible. Films based on stories of psychiatrists and mentally ill patients have been dealt about a lot in foreign films, but are seen very rare in our country . But my film, unlike other films on similar subject, does not tend to become a thriller. At the end of the day , it remains a touching human interest story .“
 
 Elaborating on the storyline, he added, “It is a highly emotive and gripping story of one fateful night in Kolkata.It depicts the journey of a lady psychiatrist (Rituparna) and a mentally ill male patient (Ritwick), who is supposedly a criminal. Rituparna's husband, a high-ranking cop played by Saswata Chatterjee, is also out on the trail to capture the criminal. In due course of time, dark secrets in the lives of the patient, the psychiatrist and the cop are revealed. The story puts forth social comments from a psychiatrist's point of view.“ The film will be shot in Kolkata, Massenjor and Bolpur from the last week of April. Also in the cast are Shankar Chakrabarty and  , among others.
 
 “I don't think we have seen a Bengali film on this subject in recent times. Kamaleswar has written a fantastic story and I am sure the audience will love it,“ said Rupa Datta, producer of the film.
