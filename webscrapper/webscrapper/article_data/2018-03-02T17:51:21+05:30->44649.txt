Like many young actors,   wants to dabble in all kinds of cinema — whether it's commercial or art house. 

 In an interview to BT, the actor shared, "I don’t think it’s right to define films as commercial or art house. What’s important is that a film evokes a certain emotion when it’s being watched. Whether it is a 'Mere Dad Ki Maruti' or 'Hawaa Hawaai', both films did decent numbers and were appreciated by the critics too. I want to do films that provide entertainment, but are also content-driven. I am not the guy who can get a Rs 10 crore opening at the box-office because I have not reached that stage in my career. Whenever people see me on screen, I want them to feel that I am making an effort and pushing the envelope. I remember heading to watch 'Dabangg' at Chandan Cinema during Eid when I landed in Mumbai from Delhi. The kind of hysteria I saw surrounding a   film was something I had not witnessed before. That’s where I want to be. I want to get mobbed and want people to see me as the guy who they can’t get enough of."
