Action star   says voicing Groot in ' ' is very challenging as the limited vocabulary makes it hard to get emotion across. The 49-year-old  's character in the   movie franchise is a tree-like humanoid named Groot who can only say "I am Groot".

  
  
 "It's very, very challenging because you're limited to three words. There's a secret script that I get where it has all of Groot's lines, but the catch of it all is the only way I can say it is: 'I am Groot'," Diesel said. 
 
  The actor says he is set for an even bigger challenge in the upcoming second instalment of the franchise, as Groot, who was seen sacrificing himself at the end of the 2014 movie and re-growing into a miniature version of himself known as Baby Groot, will need a much higher voice to encapsulate his small size. 
 
  "I have a feeling they'll do a combination of things (to alter the sound electronically). I mean, I do it super high-pitched," he said
