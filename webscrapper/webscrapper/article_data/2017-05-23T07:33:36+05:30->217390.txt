BENGALURU: In a bid to ensure that officials are always on hand to deal with unforeseen disasters such as the one the city witnessed on Saturday, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( ) commissioner   on Monday issued an order cancelling leave for officers and engineers in the Palike. The `no leave' rule will apply to officials from the rank of assistant engineers to joint commissioners.

 The directive comes in the wake of the havoc caused by Saturday's downpour. A site supervisor who was working on a storm water drain (SWD) in northwest Bengaluru was washed away . However, employees can take permission from the BBMP commissioner and request leave in the event of emergencies.
 
 Prasad also directed all the zonal joint commissioners to ensure that all preparations had been made to avert disasters in the areas that fell within their purview. “As many 72 emergency rooms will be set up in different parts of the city within three days. These centres will be equipped with relief equipment, rescue materials, etc. Personnel will be on hand to assist the public in the event of damage. The BBMP's forest cell has been directed to form 21 teams, which will develop an action plan to tackle flooding in some of the vulnerable areas in the city,“ Prasad added.
 
 All joint commissioners were also instructed to identify roads and low-lying areas prone to water-logging, and take steps to prevent the same.
