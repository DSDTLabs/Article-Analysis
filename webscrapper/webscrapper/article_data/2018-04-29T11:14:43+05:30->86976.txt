CHANDIGARH: After playing hide-and-seek with the sun for the last couple of days, sudden showers brought a wave of relief from the dry and hot temperatures prevailing in and around the city.

 With a sudden formation of overcast beginning from around 6pm in the evening on Saturday, light showers were observed across Tricity, after an hour of strong winds and light thunderstorm. However, the spell was short lived and extinguished in about 20 to 25 minutes.
 
 “Due to the excessive rise in temperatures in the region within the last two days, a high pressure zone was being created, hence rainfall was expected,” said an expert from the   department.
 
 However, the maximum and minimum temperatures on Saturday were recorded at 37.5°C and 27.6°C respectively, as per the reading checked around 17:30 hours.
 
 Moreover, the humidity which stood maximum at 44 and minimum at 30 saw a surge of 4 notches due to the evening spell.
 
 “The weather on Sunday is also expected to be the same with a possibility of light thunderstorm in the evening. However, on May 1, skies are expected to be partly cloudy. Thereafter, for the next three to four days, the weather is expected to remain cloudy with a high possibility of rain due to a western disturbance. This forecast is the same for all of Panjab,” the expert added.
