Veteran actor   made an impact in the little appearance he made on Telugu screens ��� just two films so far. In fact, his debut act in Telugu act as an escaped convict, Satyam in the   winning film   seems to have been enough for Tollywood to be moved by his demise. His last movie in Telugu would be Rana-starrer,   in which he plays a naval head in the film Ghazi and appears in the beginning of it.   remembering the actor posted, ���Extremely saddened to hear the news of Mr. Om Puri. Worked with him on Ghazi. Such a passionate actor with immense love for the craft. RIP���
