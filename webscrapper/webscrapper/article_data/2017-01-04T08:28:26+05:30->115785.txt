RAJKOT: Mumbai were 231-5 at the end of the 80th over. The second new ball was available for Tamil Nadu. But, instead of taking it immediately, TN skipper Abhinav Mukund decided against it. The new ball was finally taken after the 99th over, six deliveries before it would have been imposed on them. According to tournament rules, it is mandatory to take the new ball after the 100th over. To make matters worse, Baba Aparajith was handed the new ball instead of Aswin Crist, their pace spearhead.

 Mumbai batsmen   - also the skipper - and left-hander   made the most of Mukund's tactical blunders. When play ended on Day Three of their five-day   at the Saurashtra Cricket Association ground here, Mumbai had scored 406 and taken a substantial 101-run first-innings lead. They now have one leg in the final, to be played in Indore from Jan 10.
 
 Overnight batsmen Shreyas Iyer (24) and Tare (19) began proceedings on Tuesday. Iyer, who was down with a stomach bug on Monday, could add only 12 runs to his overnight score before edging one to Dinesh Karthik behind the stumps. When Nayar walked in to join his skipper, Mumbai were 190-5, still 115 runs adrift of TN's score of 305. The manner in which Tare and Nayar batted was commendable. Making the most of Mukund's reluctance to take the second new ball, Mumbai's seasoned campaigners started accumulating runs and slowly but confidently marched towards TN's first-innings total. The duo realised they were the last recognised batting pair for Mumbai and played according to the demands of the situation.
