CHENNAI: More than 16 years after 35 people died in a hooch tragedy at  , the Madras high court confirmed the acquittal of all the 19 surviving accused citing lack of evidence.

 “Though, it is the fact that 35 lives were lost, the evidence available is not sufficient to hold that the prosecution has proved the offence beyond reasonable doubt,” said Justice MV  .
 
 Dismissing an appeal filed by   of police, against a lower court order of acquittal, the judge said no witness spoke about the role played by any of the accused in the commission of the offence.
 
 The hooch tragedy occurred on October 5, 2001 and a total of 21 people were arrested and tried for brewing and  . After two died during the pendency of trial, the subordinate court acquitted all 19 others of all charges.
 
 Refusing to interfere with the trial court order, Justice Muralidharan said the 35 deaths had created a “serious doubt in the mind of the court as to whether the state government machineries properly functioned in their true spirit.” Though laws were made, it is doubtful whether they were   concerned, the judge said.
 
 He then rejected the appeal citing poor evidence, and said: “Unfortunately, this court has no option except to dismiss the criminal appeal filed by the state.”
