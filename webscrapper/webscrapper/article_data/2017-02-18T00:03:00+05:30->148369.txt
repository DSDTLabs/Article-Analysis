Jaipur: Loss-making power distribution companies (Discoms) in the state are battling a bigger scourge: rampant power theft.

 While the state government has issued Udhay bonds to bail out three Discoms with an accumulated loss of about Rs one lakh crore (and an additional burden of Rs 5,000 crore per annum on the state exchequer), power theft has left a huge hole in the revenue of these companies.
 
 The other day, a team of Jaipur Discom officials who went to check power theft in Alwar district was attacked. Not surprisingly, Alwar leads in power theft in Jaipur Discom with 15,258 such cases discovered after vigilance conducted checks on 16,334 units, followed by Jaipur which had 13,326 theft cases when 16,156 units were inspected.
 
 According to official figures, out of the 3,09,383 units checked last year, 1,67,601 cases of thefts were detected till December-end, which is about 54.17% of the total.
 
 In 2015, 1,32, 528 theft cases were detected when 2,59,346 units were inspected, which is also about 51 % of the total checked.
 
 Discom officials said that the number of detections has increased because the vigilance department was acting on all tip-offs. But the rise in detections was only a symptom of the disease plaguing the power distribution system in the state, they said.
 
 Chairman of the distribution companies Srimat Pandey said a loss reduction programme was being implemented in a phased manner to reduce transmission and distribution losses, including theft cases.
 
 The 24-point T&D loss reduction plan includes augmentation, repair and maintenance system, and provides for a feeder in-charge at each of the 19,000 feeders in the state.
 
 Accordingly, each feeder in-charge would inform the technical staff of the power supply and metering department of any disproportionate loss and report to the vigilance department which would conduct surprise inspections at these sites, said an official.
 
 “Our endeavour is to reduce the distribution loss to 22% from 27% this year. Each percentage reduction in distribution and transmission loss would mean revenue of Rs 400 crore to power companies,” said the official.
