BHOPAL: The   has kept pace with   and has improved passenger experience in booking tickets but the train and seat availability enquiry at   is dependent on archaic computers. While the reservation counters have latest computers, those at enquiry are almost two-decades-old and slow.

 The screen on which seat and train availability enquiry is made is hardly visible to passengers. Besides, it is very slow and irks passengers during tatkal booking and peak hours.
 
 There are 12 reservation counters at the station and one enquiry counter for seat availability query. Computers at all ticketing counters have been upgraded as per requirement but that at the enquiry and that with the chief reservation officer Rachna Tyagi are obsolete.
 
 “I tried checking the seat availability during tatkal reservation hours. Thrice I failed to read anything displayed on the screen. It's difficult to open the IRCTC website during tatkal hours on mobile phones and this also failed,” said Aman Singh, a passenger travelling to Lucknow on Tuesday.
 
 “The keyboard buttons are broken on this computer and it's nothing more than a box. It is better if they revert to the manual system, said Sneha Katare, another passenger at Habibganj Station.
 
 However, the officials shrug off all criticism and say they are comfortable handling them.
 
 While talking to TOI Rachna Tyagi said, “Yes these computers are really old, but we are comfortable working on them. There are only two systems that are old and all other employees have new ones.”
 
 “The one at enquiry is old because we had a new machine kept outside for convenience of passenger, but they started using it roughly so we had to remove it and replace with old system,” Tyagi said.
