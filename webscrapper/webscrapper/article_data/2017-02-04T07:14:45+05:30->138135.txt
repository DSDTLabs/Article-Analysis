PUNE: A 23-year-old software engineer of an IT major at   in Hinjewadi hanged himself to death at his rented apartment on Thursday afternoon.

 The police did not find any suicide note in the apartment of the deceased, Abhishek Kumar. “We suspect a recent break-up or examination stress is the reason behind his drastic decision,” sub-inspector   of the Hinjewadi police station said.
 
 Kumar, having his roots in Kanpur in  , had been working with the IT company in Hinjewadi for the past 10 months. He stayed in the apartment with his three colleagues. “Kumar was preparing for the UPSC ( ) examinations slated in April,” Ramekar said.
 
 One of Kumar’s roommates told the police that he was depressed for the past few days after breaking up with his girlfriend. “Around 11am on Thursday, his roommates left for work. Kumar told them that he would sleep because he was not feeling well,” Ramekar said.
 
 One of the colleagues of Kumar received a call on his way to the office from a woman, stating that Kumar was going to end his life. “They (Kumar’s colleagues) ran to the flat and found it locked from inside. Kumar did not respond to doorbell either,” Ramekar said.
 
 He said Kumar’s colleagues entered the flat through the balcony and found him hanging from the ceiling fan with a bed sheet tied around his neck. “His roommates brought him down and rushed him to a private hospital, where doctors declared him dead,” Ramekar said.
 
 On how Kumar had contacted the woman, Ramekar said, “We suspect he might have sent her a message or called her. We shall come to know how he exactly contacted her after we get his phone unlocked.”
 
 The police are yet to ascertain the identity of the woman.
 
 Kumar’s parents rushed to the city from Kanpur after getting information about the incident. His body was handed over to them after post-mortem.
