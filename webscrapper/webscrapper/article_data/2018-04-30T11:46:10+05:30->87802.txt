PALAKKAD: The chairman of Kerala state administrative reforms commission V S Achuthanandan, in a letter to chief minister   on Saturday, demanded a detailed probe into the mysterious deaths of two minor dalit sisters and a young woman at   areas of   grama panchayat last year. 

 The letter also urged the CM to provide protection to those minor girls who are neighbours of the sisters as there are threats against them. 
 
 Three minor girls from the neighbourhood, who are witnesses in the case, are housed in the   run by the social justice department after they received threats. The protection and education of these girls should be taken care of by the government, the letter said.
 
 The state human rights commission had found serious lapses in the probe into the mysterious deaths of the minor sisters at   in Walayar in March last year. 
 
 The commission had registered suo mottu case and ordered an inquiry after the girls aged 14 and 9 years, respectively found dead in a gap of just 53 days in February-March last year. The postmortem reports revealed that both girls were sexually abused.
 
 In another case, a 20-year-old woman from   in Walayar was found hanging in her house. The postmortem report found poisoning as the cause of her death. 
 
 The mystery behind all these cases should be probed thoroughly, VS said in the letter.
