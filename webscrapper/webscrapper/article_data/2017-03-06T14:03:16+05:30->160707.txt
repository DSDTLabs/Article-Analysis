When it comes to the female species, whether it is small girls, young women or those who are on the other side of fifties, most want to have long hair. Normally hair grows approximately half an inch per month, or about six inches per year. So, are you worried about your hair not growing? Here are some tips to help you have   and look best too.

 
 
 Just like your skin, your hair needs   too since otherwise it turns dry and brittle.   ingredients coat the cuticle to seal in moisture, reduce breakage, promote elasticity and help retain length. Thus using moisturizing products on a regular basis ensures that your hair gets conditioned, so a weekly deep moisturizing regimen is a must. Find out a deep conditioner which is meant for hair type and check the difference. However, too much of moisturising is not advisable. Too much proteins is not good for the hair and can lead to breakage and feel dry, weak and limp, no matter how much additional conditioning is done to it. Hence, check the hair products before buying and buy one which has the right ratio of protein and moisture.
 
 
 
 Use products that are oil based and contain ingredients such as avocado and coconut oils which help to keep the hair conditioned. They help the hair to moisturize at the core, by preventing breakage, energising the scalp, increasing circulation and promoting healthy hair growth.
 
 
 
 Too much of heat styling and chemical processes may give you hassle free, good looking hair but that is just a temporary option since it might break the bonds of the hair, which can never be repaired. The best thing to do is reduce the use of chemicals and heat appliances for healthier hair.
