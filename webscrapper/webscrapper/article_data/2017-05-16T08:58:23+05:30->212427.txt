I do make suggestions as far as possible... but we shud wear what makes us happy.. everyone has highs and low when it comes to dressing up... at times it's more important to look inside than outside... Whatever he wears on the outside will never do justice to what he actually is inside... trust me... just let him be happy... jo cheezen pyaar se ho Sakti hain wahan zabardasti nahi karni chahiye."
