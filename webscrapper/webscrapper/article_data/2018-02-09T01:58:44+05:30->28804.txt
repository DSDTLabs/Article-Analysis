NEW DELHI: Three days after a 23-year-old youth was stabbed to death by his sister’s boyfriend in Kirari village near Aman Vihar in outer Delhi, the accused, Deepak Jha (20), was arrested from Karol Bagh and taken on a two-day police remand.

 Family members of the victim, Mithilesh Jha, said their 18-year-old daughter was in a relationship with Deepak for the past four years. When Mithilesh got to know about it, he tried to persuade his sister to end the relationship, but she didn’t budge.
 
 Eight months ago, Mithilesh slapped Deepak during a fight and warned him to stay away from his sister. However, the accused still kept in touch with the girl over the phone and used to meet her secretly.
 
 On the day of the incident, the girl and her mother got into an argument when the latter came to know that she was still seeing Deepak. The girl then called Deepak, who came and sat near the house with his friends.
 
 Mithilesh, who works in a small automobile shop in the area, was returning to his house when he saw Deepak sitting there with two of his friends and they got into an argument.
 
 A pan shop owner said that the fight started around 4.15pm. “Two men held Mithilesh’s arms and Deepak stabbed him twice. He started bleeding from his chest and abdomen. His parents came out and took him into their house. Later, he was taken in an ambulance. He was conscious at the time,” he added.
 
 After the stabbing, the victim’s mother, father and two sisters shifted to a relative’s place. The father, Mahesh Jha, said that they feared being harmed by the accused’s family members. “Mithilesh was the sole breadwinner of the family. Deepak has not yet revealed the names of his two associates to the cops,” Mahesh said.
