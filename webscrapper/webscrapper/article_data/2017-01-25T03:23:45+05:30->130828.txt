NEW DELHI: An area near gate number 7 of   has been dug up by   (NDMC) to install mobile towers, which will result in cutting down of old trees and disrupting the habitat. Roots of four trees, at least 40 years old, have been already damaged, said activists. 

 Suhas Borker, founding member of Green Circle of Delhi—a volunteer group of activists, has written to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking his immediate intervention. The letter, which has been signed by 177 regular walkers, says two huge pits have been dug up damaging four trees and urges the LG to make strict guidelines to ensure no trees are damaged in future. 
 
 However, NDMC claimed that soon after the digging started in the last week of December, the project was scrapped and no mobile tower would be installed in Lodhi Garden. “The horticulture department has been directed to level up the dug-up portions,” said J P Sharma, the director of horticulture department, NDMC.
 
 “The plan of installing mobile towers is a bizarre proposal in itself. How can any civic authority disturb the habitat of a lively garden?” said Borker. Installation of mobile towers will disturb the habitat. “Lodhi Garden is the only place in Lutyens’ Delhi where one can find so many varieties of birds,” he added. A few years ago,  , along with Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems in Delhi University, helped NDMC set up a butterfly conservatory in the garden.
 
 Experts said a garden or a park was not a place to install mobile towers. Bikram Grewal, an ornithologist, said, “It is a stupid idea to install mobile towers in a garden where people come to take a stroll. A mobile tower should be installed on building rooftops, not in parks.”
