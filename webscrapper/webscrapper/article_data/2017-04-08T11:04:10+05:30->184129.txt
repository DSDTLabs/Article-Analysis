MHOW: Bihar’s governor   attended a daylong seminar on Dr BR Ambedkar’s thoughts and philosophy and government functioning at   on Friday. The seminar was organised to mark the 110th birth anniversary of Babu Jagjiwan Ram.

 Kovind said, “It doesn’t matter which party’s government is in the Centre and the States since the beauty of the country is that the government has to function according to the constitution given by Ambedkar.”
 
 He said that Ambedkar never advocated for making of states on the basis of languages but on the basis of administrative requirements which was later overlooked by our governments.
 
 Vice chancellor Dr RS Kureel and registrar Dr B Bharti conferred Kovind with life time achievement award on this occasion.
