JANGLA (BASTAR): PM   on Saturday flagged off the much-anticipated   scheme and the first passenger train in the heart of Maoist-affected territory in Chhattisgarh.

 
 This is the first time that any prime minister has visited a remote, insurgency-affected region. Modi had earlier visited Dantewada and   had been to Jagdalpur, but both of them are urban areas.
 
 “Ayushman Yojana is a game-changing health initiative, aimed at creating facilities to treat a host of communicable and non-communicable diseases, mainly in rural areas. These centres will function like family doctors for people in villages,” the PM said.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 The government plans to open 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres by 2022 to deliver comprehensive primary healthcare to communities. The second component of Ayushman Bharat is to provide insurance cover to 40% of India’s population for secondary and tertiary care. “The objective of Ayushman Bharat scheme is to build a healthy, efficient and satisfied new India,” he added.
 
 Modi , who visited the Jangla health and wellness centre—which was earlier a community health centre— said the scheme aims to transform sub-centres and primary health care centres into health and wellness centres where facilities such as teleconsultation would be provided. These centres will be equipped for pregnancy and childbirth and to treat a host of diseases, from hypertension and diabetes to cancer and geriatric ailments. He visited Jangala Development Hub, situated in a model panchayat, and interacted with local ‘Champions of Change’ in this left wing extremism-affected district.
 
 Modi also flagged off a train on newly-built 17-km tracks between Gudum and Bhanupratappur via video conferencing. in the presence of Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh. The tracks link north Bastar to the railway map.
