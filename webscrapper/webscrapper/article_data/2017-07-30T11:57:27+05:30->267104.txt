PANAJI: With the peak month of monsoon season, July witnessing only light to moderate  , the deficit is slowly mounting and farmers in some areas are getting worried over the impact of dry spells on their crops. The deficit has risen to 16%, as the seasonal total touched 1,605.4mm (63.2 inches) on Saturday, while the normal should be 1,909.9mm (75.1 inches) at this stage.

 “The overall situation is okay, as some areas like Canacona have even got surplus rain, but there could be a slight problem in localized conditions,” director, agriculture department,   said. In upland areas, paddy and sugarcane crops can suffer stress during certain stages due to scarce rainfall. “When paddy crop reaches tillering stage and if there is no water at the base of the plant, it will have biotic stress,” agronomist and former Indian council of agricultural research, ( ) scientist,   said.
 
 Rainfall activity has been weak during the last few days. It was only Quepem rain gauge station that recorded heavy rainfall of 70.0mm during the last 24 hours till Saturday morning. A few other centres recorded moderate rainfall, Ponda 36.8mm, Valpoi 34.0mm, Sakhali 32.6mm, Mapusa 29.0mm and other centres on a lesser scale. Figures of rainfall recorded in   and Margao were not available.
 
 The meteorological centre has forecast light to moderate rain or thundershowers at most places over Goa during the next five days. “A few spells of rain are likely due to weak monsoon activity,” an official said.
