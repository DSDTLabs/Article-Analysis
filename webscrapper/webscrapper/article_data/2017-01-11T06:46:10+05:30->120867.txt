CHANDIGARH: The recent move of the Haryana government to amend the   (Engagement) Act, 2016, to facilitate re-engagement of law officers, whose term has expired since the commencement of the Act, has been challenged before the Punjab and Haryana high court.

 After accepting the proposal to amend the law, the   government on January 3 had also decided to bring an ordinance to effect the amendment considering delay in the session of  .
 
 The law regarding law officers' appointment has been challenged by advocate   on whose petition the  , in March 2016, had directed Punjab and Haryana to frame guidelines for making appointments of law officers on the basis of merit and eligibility, and not for “political aggrandizement and appeasement“.
 
 In his petition, which would come up for hearing on Wednesday before the HC, Rapria has sought directions to quash the Haryana Law Officers (engagement) Act 2016 and rules framed thereafter being ultra vires to the Constitution and directions of the apex court.
 
 Further, directions have also been sought to produce the record to see the steps taken to implement the guidelines framed by the apex court regarding appointments of law officers in advocate general's office.
 
 In its March 2016 verdict, SC had laid down the procedure directing the two states to constitute a search committee that would recommend a panel of names to the chief justice of the high court, who shall revert with his views after consulting other judges.
 
 The state government can subsequently make appointments, the court had held.
 
 Though the Haryana government had framed a law in compliance of SC verdict, but had tweaked the rules to accommodate already appointed law officers.
