CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress   on Monday lashed out at Akhil Bharatiya Janata Party (ABVP) over   student and Kargil martyr’s daughter   rape and death threats for speaking out against the right-wing students’ party.

 “The girl’s father laid down his life for the country during the Kargil war and she is now being victimized for her legitimate act,” said Amarinder.
 
 Expressing shock at the brazenness of the ABVP, which had indulged in unprovoked and rampant violence against students and teachers of Ramjas College, the Congress chief ministerial candidate said the threats to Gurmehar reflected a total disregard for the law of the land. “The failure of the Delhi Police to act against ABVP goondas who unleashed unprovoked violence at   on February 22 has clearly encouraged such heinous threats,” said Captain Amarinder.
 
 He warned that failure to crack down on ABVP would encourage more anti-social elements to take law in their hands.
 
 Lauding Gurmehar’s courage in launching a social media campaign against the ABVP, Amarinder said instead of allowing her to be victimized for her stand, the authorities, including Delhi and central governments, should ensure that the perpetrators of the Ramjas College violence and the subsequent threats to the martyr’s daughter are given exemplary punishment for vitiating the DU campus atmosphere.
 
 In the wake of the Ramjas College incident, Gurmehar had changed her Facebook profile picture holding a placard which read: “I am a student from Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP.” The reported ABVP threat came even as her profile picture went viral and evoked humungous response on the social media.
