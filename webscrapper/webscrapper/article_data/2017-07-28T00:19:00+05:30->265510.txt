 Ludhiana: The civic officials have served a recovery notice to a private firm which is handling advertisement tenders on bus queue shelters in the city. The company has not cleared the advertisement tax on the advertisement through these bus shelters since 2015.
 
 The MC has served this notice to the company after the high court disposed of the writ filed by the company.
 
 The MC has to recover a total of Rs 32.87 lakh from that firm out of which Rs 16.77 lakh was due till March 31, 2015 and Rs 16.10 lakh is to be recovered from April 1, 2015 till July 31 2017.
 
 The fund-strapped MC is looking out for every possible measure to bring revenue and this is also one of the sources from where the officials can generate some money.
 
 The manager with Ludhiana City Bus Services Limited (LCBSL) Baljit Singh said a contract was signed between the LCBSL and that private firm for raising 76 bus queue shelters in the city and the company was also allowed to handle the advertisement rights of these bus queue shelters.
 
 He revealed that the company could raise only 23 bus queue shelters and in the contract it was clearly mentioned that company will have to pay advertisement tax to the MC.
 
 Meanwhile, MC superintendent Harvinder Dhalla said the court has given decision in their favour and the case has been disposed of which is why they have served the notice to the company.
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said they have served the notice to the company to clear the advertisement tax dues within 7 days after getting this notice otherwise they will forfeit the security amount and will also write the government for cancellation of their contract.
