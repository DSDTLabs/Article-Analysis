NEW DELHI: You may soon be able to use your smartphone as a ticket in Delhi Metro. The mass transit utility is going to introduce a QR (quick response) code-based   at two of its stations —   and   — and instead of purchasing tokens commuters can use the e-tickets.

  (DMRC) spokesperson Anuj Dayal said that the experimental ticketing system will become operational from next month. “The e-tickets can be used at one gate at both the stations. Based on the outcome of the trial, the facility will be extended on a full scale,” he added.
 
 The e-ticketing system will be accessible only when the ITO to Kashmere Gate section of the Heritage line becomes operational in February.
 
 Officials, however, said that the QR code-based ticketing system is not likely to replace smart cards. At present, around 70% of Metro commuters use smart cards. “The e-tickets, if successful, may not be a good replacement for smart cards due to poor transaction speed. However, they can be a good replacement for single journey tokens,” Dayal said.
 
 The QR code-based tickets will work the same way as an e-ticket for the movies. A commuter can purchase the ticket online and get a code to be used instead of a token. The   reading machine at the station gate will read the code on the smartphone, just like the automatic fare collection gates read smart cards.
