 was the theme of a dance party hosted by Manya club. Following the theme, the ladies came dressed in their dazzling best. The décor was also quite in sync with the theme with a lot of glitter around. Gold coloured balloons and shimmering drapes formed the décor of the bash. 
Anu Mehrotra, president of the club, welcomed   from Delhi, who with a perfect mashup of old and current Bollywood hits, kept the guest glued to the dance floor. 
 Adding to the fun were the gifts that were given to the guests which were announced by DJ Moni. Nancy Batra was crowned as the Most Beautiful Smile while Shweta Singh was awarded for having the maximum bling. Shashibala received a special award for being the only one wearing a sari.
