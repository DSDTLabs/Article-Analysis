HUBBALLI: National Award winning actor  's work and concern for debt-ridden farmers of   inspired Bidar's   to select him for the prestigious Guru Basava Puraskar 2017. Patekar will receive the honour, which carries Rs 51,000 cash reward and a plaque, on February 9.

 Basava   has honoured prominent personalities who have been instrumental in bringing a change in society. They include social activist Anna Hazare, Dr Prakash Amte and Justice Shivaraj Patil. Patekar has been chosen for this year's award for his concern and help to debt-ridden farmers of Marathawada, Vidarbha and other districts in Maharashtra.
 
 “We select people based on their work and efforts to transform the lives of the poor, farmers among others, also their sheer dedication for the cause irrespective of caste, creed and religion of the people,“ Basava Seva Peeth convener Ramesh pointed out. “Many farmers facing a drought-like situation have committed suicide in Karnataka too, but most of the Kannada actors have showed no concern. Patekar can be a role model for them,“ said Ramesh, adding that the actor initially refused to accept the award and it took six months to convince him.
