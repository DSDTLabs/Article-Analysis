Model-turned-actor   was declared the winner of the first season of   and he walked away with the grand prize of Rs 50, 00,000 in cash. The finalists of the show were lyricist  , actors   Kalyan and Ganesh Venkatraman. Though it was said that Ganesh Venkatraman would walk away with the coveted title, he ended up as the second runner-up on the show. Harish Kalyan, who entered the house after a few weeks, became a darling of the house and won many hearts among the audience, too. The friendship between Bindu, Arav and Harish was indeed a heart-warming one.

 Snehan, on the other hand, was the first person to get a ticket to the finale. Arav and Snehan were the last two candidates on the show. Arav earned the public wrath after he rebuffed people’s favourite   and was thereafter nominated by his fellow housemates. Arav was quite close to Oviya and the duo was alleged to be more than friends. The term ‘maruthuvam mutham’(medical kiss) became quite a popular term and was well used by meme creators, trolls and audience, courtesy Arav.
 
 After the initial upheavals with Oviya (who had expressed her love for him and he had rejected her), Arav ensured he steered clear of all controversies. He started being diplomatic about certain things and played it safe after Oviya’s voluntary exit from the show. At the same time, he managed to have his share of fun and actively took part in all the tasks assigned in the house. By the end, Arav emerged as the hero of the show.
 
 Kamal Haasan revealed that 76, 76, 53,065 votes were cast during the entire season. He added that if at least 10 per cent of the votes are cast properly there (hinting at the Assembly elections), we can see a change. 
 
 Vijay Antony gave him a break with a small role in Saithan. Though the actor didn’t have any dialogue in the film, he seemed to have impressed the audience.
