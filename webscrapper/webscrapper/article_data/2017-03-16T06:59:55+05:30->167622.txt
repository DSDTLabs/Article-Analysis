Chief minister   present ed his 12th Budget before the assembly on Wednesday, a crucial one in the year before Karnataka goes to the polls and at a time when BJP seems to be holding all the cards when it comes to luck at the hustings. In his post-Budget press conference, the CM spoke about how he has fared far better than the BJP in fund allocation.

 
 After being hit by demonetization and drought, people expected a growth-oriented budget. I've delivered an inclusive and pro-development budget to enable sustainable economic growth.
 
 
 I'm not sure whether it was the farmers or the media who were hoping for a loan waiver! I had made it very clear earlier that we'll waive farm loans only if the Centre agrees to waive farm loans in nationalized banks. Otherwise, our gesture won't mean much as only 20% of farmers will benefit. My idea is to put pressure on the BJP to share the burden to provide relief to the majority of farmers. Let's wait and see what state BJP president B S Yeddyurappa does.
 
 
 When the BJP governed between 2008 and 2013, it allocated Rs 7,338 crore for agriculture.
 In four years, we have allocated Rs 19,523 crore, nearly thrice that amount. This year, we ensured agriculture gets over Rs 5,000 crore and drafted various schemes to help farmers.
 
 
 There has been huge impact since the GSDP in 2016-17 grew at 6.9 % against 7.3% during 2015-16. This is largely due to decline in the growth of industry and service sectors, a national phenomenon.
 
 
 My budgets have always been inclusive and pro-poor. But the opposition brands it Ahinda'. We do it because the ` BJP government had neglected the SCST and minorities by making meagre allocations. But, we ensured they get their due. While the BJP had allocated Rs 5,554 crore for the welfare of SCSTs and Rs 145 crore for minorities, we have, in four years, earmarked Rs 17,388 crore for SCSTs and Rs 5,995 crore for minorities.
 
 
 The overall size of the 2017-18 budget is Rs 1,86,561 crore compared to Rs 1,63419 crore last year. The total liabilities of Rs 2,42,420 crore, estimated to be 18.9% of the GSDP, is within the ceiling of 25% limit of the Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act. No government can be run without borrowing.
