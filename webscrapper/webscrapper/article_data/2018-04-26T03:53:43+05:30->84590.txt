AHMEDABAD: Controversial former IPS officer   says the Jodhpur court convicting and awarding life term to godman Asaram for raping a minor girl is not the final verdict, and believes ‘Bapuji’ will be cleared of all charges by the high court.

 
 “I appeal to my countrymen and people of Gujarat that this isn’t a rape case. We will approach the high court and if need be go to the  . We are hopeful that   will be declared innocent by the HC,” Vanzara, a murder accused in the Israt Jahan fake encounter case, told reporters on Wednesday.
 
 “Asaram has been framed. A campaign was carried out against Bapuji to bring disrepute to saints and Sanatan Dharma,” Vanzara, a ‘shishya’ (disciple) of Asaram, said. “I’ve a copy of the FIR where the survivor doesn’t say she was raped. Nor has she said it in her statement... The chargesheet, too, states she wasn’t raped,” he said.
