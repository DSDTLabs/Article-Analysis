Ludhiana: Continuing its efforts to make people pay their share of taxes, the income tax (I-T) department, Ludhiana, roped in over three lakh students from 700 schools as its young ambassadors during a mass tax awareness campaign on Thursday.

 The students will be first given knowledge about what income tax is and later they will be made to take a pledge to spread awareness about the same in the society.
 
 Chief commissioner of income tax Binay K Jha, who officially launched the campaign at DAV Public School, BRS Nagar, planted a sapling in the presence of school students and I-T officials including principal commissioners Parneet Sachdev, R Bhama, Avdesh Mishra and Rajiv Ranjan; additional commissioner Rohit Mehra; joint Commissioner Manav Bansal.
 
 Jha said, “Like last year, we are carrying out an extensive tax awareness programme called as ‘Tax Tree-2’. This initiative aims to make lakhs of school children aware about the importance of taxes paid by citizens in nation building. Different teams comprising close to 500 members including employees of I-T department, members of the bar association and other volunteers would visit schools to administer the ‘Swachh Bharat Swachh Dhan’ oath to school children, and plant a tax tree during the programme,” Jha said.
 
 “We have also launched ‘Tax Your Mind’ app on our website www.apnakar.com which is an interesting way to create tax awareness amongst children. The best part is that the entire programme would be paperless as it would be run on a mobile link between the teams at schools and a central control room at the income tax office, Rishi Nagar, Ludhiana.”
 
 The I-T department had carried out a similar awareness initiative last year under which 3.96 lakh students were covered in a single day. Results of this unique project was evident when record number of close to 4 lakh new taxpayers were added in tax net of Ludhiana range of I-T department.
