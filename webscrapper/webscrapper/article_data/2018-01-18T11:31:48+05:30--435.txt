PORVORIM: Chief minister Manohar  , on Wednesday, said that the Goa (Right to   Delivery of Public Services) Act, 2013, would be notified in its entirety by January-end and government staff would be given two months to prepare for the April 1 roll out.

 Speaking to reporters after launching the Goa   Regulatory Authority (RERA) portal, Parrikar added that implementation of the Goa (Right to Time-bound Delivery of Public Services) Act would address concerns among the real estate industry about quick approvals from government bodies.
 
 “There is one demand that NOCs from panchayats and governments must be given on time. From April 1, the time bound service kicks in,” Parrikar said. “Under the act, you cannot delay any application beyond a particular number of days. And people have the right to go against the delay.”
 
 The chief minister said he had asked for the Goa (Right to Time-bound Delivery of Public Services) Act to be notified by January 26, after which government staff will be given two months to understand and implement it.
 
 “By this month end, the full act will be notified. They have two months to create the backend, study the implications,” Parrikar said. “We will conduct training camps and train them on whatever is required.”
 
 The chief minister added that any government officer who delays any approval or fails to clear a particular file on time “could be penalized financially” and the secretary of the relevant department would be held responsible for the delay.
 
 He added that time-bound approvals also depended on proper submission of documents by applicants. “It is the responsibility of the applicant to make sure that the papers are in order. Very often the papers of the applicant are not proper. In such cases, remedies don’t help,” Parrikar said.
