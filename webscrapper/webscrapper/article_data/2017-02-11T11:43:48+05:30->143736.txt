HYDERABAD: A cashier working at D-Mart in   was arrested on Friday by   for   details from customers. E Nagasai, 23, was sent to judicial remand by the magistrate at Kukatpally on Friday.

 On February 8, Sunil Chhajar, a resident of HUDA colony, filed a complaint with police stating that Rs 35,000 had been debited from his ICICI bank account without his knowledge.
 
 The complainant also stated that his card was used in a petrol pump, at D-mart, at Reliance Trendz and at Reliance Fresh.
 
 "On January 17, the complainant had gone to D-Mart shop and had purchased some items. When he went for billing, he gave his debit card to the accused. The accused noted the debit card number and asked the customer for his PIN number to complete billing," said an official.
 
 During investigation, it came to light that Naga Sai joined D-Mart shopping mall as a cashier in December last year. He used to take debit cards from the customers for billing.
 
 He then hatched a plan to note the card numbers and the PIN. During interrogation, Sai confessed to have committed two more similar offences.
