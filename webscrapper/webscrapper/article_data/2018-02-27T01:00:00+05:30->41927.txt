GAYA: Normalcy returned to Bodh Gaya on Monday after a three-day bandh called by local traders against the new traffic arrangement in the vicinity of Mahabodhi Mahavihara.

 The new traffic system was implemented last Monday, as per which four-wheelers are not allowed beyond node 1 and node 2. Several banks are located in the restricted area and most of the bank customers, including senior citizens, are required to walk the distance between node 1 and the banks.
 
 Sources said the new traffic system banning entry of four- wheelers in a radius of one km from Mahabodhi Mahavihara would stay despite the bandh. “The strategy may be to tire out the protesting businessmen as they by nature and training are incapable of remaining in confrontation mode for long,” said retired IG M A Kazmi.
 
 Nagrik Vikas Manch chairman Suresh Singh said the new traffic system would add to the woes of Bodh Gaya businessmen who were already hit by the decline in tourist footfall due to explosions and liquor prohibition laws. 
 
 Favouring exemption for foreign tourists from the prohibition ambit, Singh said liquor was part of the regular menu for most foreign tourists. “My contacts in Japan say the Japanese raised the prohibition issue during chief minister Nitish Kumar's recent visit to Japan. But the CM refused to grant exemption even to foreigners visiting Bihar,” Singh said.
