Ludhiana: Three burglars come in a Maruti Swift car and decamped with Rs25,000 from a pharmacy in Kitchlu Nagar in the wee hours of Wednesday. The accused opened both the locks of the pharmacy with a master key. The CCTV installed in the store captured one masked miscreant inside the store, while another CCTV captured another accused sitting in a car, and a third one standing outside the store.

 Shop-owner Rajeev Kumar said he and his son closed the shop on Tuesday at around 10pm. Next morning, on reaching the store at 9am, they were shocked to see the lock opened and cash missing from the counter. Immediately, they sounded the police.
 
 Curiously, the accused had barged into the store thrice. At first, they parked the car outside the store. However, at that time, a PCR van was passing through the road, therefore they fled from there. A few minutes later, they returned and opened both the locks with a master key, and also took the locks along with them while decamping with the cash. Minutes later, they returned to pull down the shopâ€™s shutters, which was earlier left open.
 
 The SHO at PAU police station, inspector Brij Mohan, said the shop-owner had given a statement to the police that he did not want to lodge an FIR.
