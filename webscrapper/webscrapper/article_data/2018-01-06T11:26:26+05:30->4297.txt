BHUBANESWAR/KEONJHAR: The Orissa high court on Friday reinstated nine rebel   councillors in Keonjhar municipality, around two years after they were disqualified by the state election commission (SEC) for defying party orders during a no-confidence motion in 2015. 

 The SEC had unseated them on February 22, 2016 using the anti-defection laws, a first for any municipal body in Odisha. In December 2015 the state government had amended the Odisha Municipal Act, 1950, and introduced disqualification provision, similar to the anti-defection law in Parliament and assembly, for those disobeying the party diktat. 
 
 The councillors had defied the party whip during the no-trust vote against the then municipal chairperson Meena Majhi on December 28, 2015. Because of their votes against Meena, she lost the motion and had to step down, embarassing the BJD.
 
 On Friday, Justice S K Mishra set aside the SEC order. "We argued in court that the disqualification was not applicable in our case as the no-confidence motion against the chairperson was moved before the amended provision came into force. The court took note of it and quashed the order of the SEC," said  , counsel for the disqualified BJD councillors.
