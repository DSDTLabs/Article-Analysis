BENGALURU: Bengaluru development minister   announced on Thursday that the   had been scrapped, but the   (BDA) continued to say that only the tender had been cancelled and not the entire project.

 BDA engineering member   told TOI: “Only the tender has been cancelled.The project is not scrapped.There is a huge difference between scrapping a project and cancelling the tender.“
 
 Sources in the government concurred. They said that the project could be revived if the Congress comes back to power after the 2018 state elections. They also said that the steel flyover is part of an ambitious 83-km   criss-crossing the city.
 
 Soil testing for the road network has commenced in many parts of the city and work has been undertaken by Karnataka Road Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the PWD department. Going by BDA's understanding of the chief minister's instructions, it means the project has not been not scrapped and BDA can call fresh tenders again.
 
 Although officials did not divulge information about the cost incurred on the project till date, infrastructure experts estimated that the agency spent Rs10-13 crore to prepare the detailed project report, initial feasibility report, soil testing and tender making process.
 
 Tara Krishnaswamy, member of Citizens for Bengaluru, said: “This is sheer waste of public money on a project that was not properly planned and was never justified.“
 
 Nayak said there was no clause to pay a penalty to the contractor.
