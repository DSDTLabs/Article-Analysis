 It is this attitude of the state government that is facing a strong protest from medical students who have planned a one day sit in before Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS) on Monday . The protest is also being supported by medical students who donot have a supplementary paper.
 
 There are 250 seats in Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital and every year at least 20 students get a supplementary paper and form a new “remanded“ batch. According to these students of “remanded“ batch, their studies get adversely affected as they are segregated and no matter how well they perform in the second and third years, they never get merged with the main batch.
 
 Students, preferring anonymity said, ``It is just like a taboo that we are never able to get rid off. Even in our mark sheets, there is a mention of “remanded“ batch.
 
 However, the medical education department and SMS Medical College claimed that the conditions are in arrangement with the Medical Council of India norms.
