BHAGALPUR: Two powerful bomb explosions in   Lane rocked the main bazaar area in   of the town around 9pm on Saturday. Two persons were injured in the explosions.

 The sources said the bombs were hurled on one Md Iqbal Ansari when he was inside his tailoring shop in Wazid Ali Shah Maszid lane under Kotwali police station. Sources said a nearby beetle shopowner and another person received splinter injuries while Ansari‘s shop was damaged.
 
 Ansari claimed he was having a family dispute with his in-laws. On Friday, he and his wife had reconciliation talks, which were not being appreciated by some of his in-laws. Sometimes back, he was subject to physical attack also, Ansari alleged while obliquely hinting that the bomb explosions might be the handiwork of his in-laws.
 
 Police have recovered some scraps of the exploded bombs from the spot. Meanwhile, police claimed to have identified the persons involved in the bomb attack and explosions. Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar said the criminals would be arrested soon. “We are also looking into the issue whether there is any organized gang involved in the incident to terrorize people.”
