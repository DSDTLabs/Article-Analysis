 “The men tried to drag the woman inside the car near Gate No. 5 of Aditya Mega City housing society. She raised a hue and cry and wriggled out. As locals on the road rushed to her rescue, the car fled from the spot in the reverse direction. Two boys who were standing near a cigarette kiosk followed the car and found it parked near an ATM a short distance away. Police went to the ATM but could not find the car. When we were returning to the spot, the car again came speeding back near Gate No. 5 of Aditya Mega City. We were driving on the wrong side and placed our bike right across the car thus blocking its path. Police and locals overpowered the men,” said Gopal Kapoor, a resident of Amrapalli Royal housing society.
 
 “We have received the complaint. The woman will be questioned. The identity of the two men is yet to be ascertained as they are heavily inebriated and are barely able to speak. The men are being sent for a medical examination,” said in-charge of Indirapuram police station Pawan Kumar.
