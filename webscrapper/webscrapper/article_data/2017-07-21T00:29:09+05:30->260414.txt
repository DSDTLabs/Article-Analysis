 Five days after the killing of   Sultan Masih outside a church in Peeru Banda Mohalla of Salem Tabri area, cops have not been able to identify the assailants in the case. The only clue they could get so far is the killers were riding a black Pulsar bike with a blue lining. 
 
 Sources said cops have also rounded up a man from Tejpur road with a bike with a similar colour combination for questioning. Police said the antecdents of people with some suspicious activities are also being checked to get some clues. “The bike used by assailants was of black color with blue lining over it. After getting this information, the police teams at checkpoints have carefully started checking such bike,” said a senior police official. 
 
 Sources meanwhile said that the cops were heavily banking on the the civil intelligence in the case, hoping the locals in the area could provide some clue in the case. On Thursday the Commissioner of Police RN Dhoke held a meeting with all senior officials and the SHOs to assess the progress in the case. 
 
 “When Pastor was shot by assailants, a cyclist was passing by, who was the witness of the killing. However he did not stop there. Similarly we think that some other nearby residents must have seen anything or must have any clue, which may help us tracking the assailants,” said an official. Besides other possibilities, cops are also looking into the possibility of personal rivalry.
 
 Senior police officials recall there have been a number of instances in which locals have helped police in cracking a blind case.
