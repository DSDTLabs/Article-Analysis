PANAJI: The   is likely to meet Goa governor Mridula Sinha next week to express concern over chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s continued absence from the state. “There is no government in the state,”   president Shantaram Naik, said. “Parrikar has over 20 portfolios. Have they been assigned to anyone? Even his party colleagues and his cabinet members are unaware of his health.”

 Meanwhile, a day ahead of the token day-long fast that   MPs will observe across the country, Naik said the BJP was to blame for the impasse in Parliament. “PM   can give good speeches but can’t answer opposition benches and give point-by-point responses to criticism from the Congress. That is why he does not allow Parliament to function,” he said, adding that the BJP had disrupted proceedings even when it was in the opposition during the UPA government’s tenure.
