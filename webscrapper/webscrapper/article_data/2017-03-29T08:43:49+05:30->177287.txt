PATNA: With the   (SEC) on Monday announcing the date for   (PMC) election on May 28, speculations have begun over who will succeed Mayor Afzal Imam.

 The civic body election in Bihar is not fought on party lines. As per the SEC notification, the PMC will have a woman Mayor this time as prescribed by the Bihar Municipal Election Rules 2007. Not surprisingly, sources said, many sitting male ward councillors have decided to field their wives in the upcoming polls.
 
 The names of the Mayor probables doing the rounds include Abha Lata, sitting councillor (ward number 4), Pinki Yadav, sitting councillor (ward number 31) and deputy Mayor Amravati Devi. 
 
 “I am the rightful claimant for the post of Mayor. I have been active in politics for more than two decades and a councillor from different wards since 2002. As a member of the empowered standing committee, I was actively involved in the development works undertaken by the PMC. I will carry forward the works initiated by outgoing Mayor Afzal,” said Abha, who is also the state president of RJD’s women cell.
 
 Former deputy Mayor Roop Narayan Mehta, however, claimed that Pinki Yadav would be a more suitable candidate for the post. “We will support Pinki’s candidature for the post as she is quite popular among people and ward councillors as well,” said Mehta, who is the state vice-president of  , youth wing of BJP.
 
 Several other ward councillors, however, said it was premature to stake such claims now. “Many veterans end up losing the election... Let the ward councillors get re-elected first... Talks of Mayor candidature should begin after that,” said Sanjay Kumar Singh, councillor from ward number 1.
 
 The last civic body election in Patna was held on May 22, 2012 following which Afzal was elected the Mayor on June 10 the same year. He survived a no-confidence motion on June 26, 2014 and another on August 11, 2015.
