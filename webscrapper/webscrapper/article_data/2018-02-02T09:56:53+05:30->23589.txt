JAIPUR: On the face of it, Budget 2018-19 doesn’t seem to have much for the tourism sector in Rajasthan. Finance minister   said that 10 prominent tourist sites in the country would be developed into ‘Iconic Tourist Destinations’ to boost tourism in these regions. Besides, tourist amenities will be upgraded at 100 Adarsh Monuments of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) across the country.

 “Rajasthan had sent proposals for Amber Fort and Pushkar. We hope to get at least one of the two to be developed as an iconic destination,” said Hridesh Kumar, director of archaeology and museums.
 
 The FM also said that the National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojna (HRIDAY) to revitalize heritage cities would continue to gain momentum.
 
 A few Adarsh Monuments in the state are also likely to get infrastructure boost with facilities like Wi-Fi, signages, pathways and beautification. Additional works like garbage removal, rainwater harvesting, disposal of waste, public conveniences, wastewater management, etc. would also be undertaken.
 
 According to Dr D N Dimri, director (antiquity), ASI Headquarters in Delhi, “Rajasthan has a few monuments under the Adarsh Scheme. They are Kumbhalgarh, Chittorgarh and Ranthambhore forts, Deeg Palace, Arthuna group of temples and the Saas Bahu Temple. A lot of work has been undertaken at Kumbhalgarh. Depending on site specific requirements, funds will be released this financial year.”
