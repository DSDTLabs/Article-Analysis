 worked exceptionally hard to knock off 15 kilos to play the protagonist in 'The Final EXIT', which also features Ananya Sengupta, Scarlett Wilson, Elena Kazan, Archana Vedasastry and  . The actor, who flagged off his career with the TV series, Just Mohabbat, has previously worked in films like Loins of Punjab Presents,   and Action Jackson. He’s remembered for his work in Delhi Belly and Nautanki Saala.

 The underrated actor will now be seen in the supernatural horror thriller as Vidyut, a celebrated photographer, pessimist and cynic, lost in worldly desires while trying to find meaning in his life. He gets fascinated by a recurring dream of shooting the most beautiful model ever, to the point that he begins to feel she really exists. Kunal says, “My character Vidyut is a wealthy fashion photographer who indulges in drinking, smoking, drugs and sex. He’s a womaniser, who keeps changing his partners frequently. However, a sense of emptiness creeps in and he starts looking for the purpose of his existence.” The actor doesn’t draw parallels between his character and his real life. Kunal believes that he had matured at the age of 14, and unlike his character, is satisfied with his life today.
 
 Talking about the experience of working with producers Mrunal Jhaveri and  , and director-writer Dhwanil Mehta, Kunal says, “Dhwanil was the first one to get in touch with me. I liked the script and wondered, ‘Why not work on something which is not a comedy?’ So, I gave my nod to this film. While Mrunal and Vishal are cool to work with, I was also amazed to work with someone like Dhwanil who was so clear about what he wanted from his actors despite being a debutant.”
 
 'The Final EXIT', presented by Tony D’Souza and produced by Mars Entertainment, releases on September 22, 2017.
