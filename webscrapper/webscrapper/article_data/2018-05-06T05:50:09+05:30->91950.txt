CHENNAI: Two men drowned in the sea off   in separate incidents opposite Ezhilagam on Friday evening. 

  Narayanappa, 27, a casual labourer at a ration shop in Hosur, came to the city to participate in a protest at Chepauk. When he was in the water, he was engulfed by a huge wave.
 
 As Rajasekar cried for help, his friends and onlookers alerted fishermen, who ventured into the sea and searched for the man. His friends later informed the Anna Square police and submitted a missing man complaint. 
 
 In the second incident reported 100 metres from the first, Mephsunar, 17, employed at a restaurant in Perambur, went to the beach with his friends when he was engulfed by a tide. His friends attempted to rescue him but in vain. They too lodged a complaint at the Anna Square police station.
 
 Fishermen later informed the police of two bodies that had washed ashore half-a-kilometre from where the two men had disappeared. The police recovered the bodies, which were sent to the Government Royapettah Hospital for autopsy.
