NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court bid farewell to its first woman chief justice, whose nearly 3-year tenure ended with her retirement on Thursday.

 Chief Justice   is the fourth senior judge to leave   after Justices Indira Banerji, B D Ahmed and Pradeep Nandrajog left in quick succession in past two weeks as chief justices of other high courts.
 
 Justice Rohini had the longest tenure of nearly 3 years and leaves at a time when the country’s four major high courts are all being led by women— a rare feat for judiciary. Till a new chief justice joins, another woman, Justice Gita Mitta will be acting chief justice.
 
 As per sources the Supreme Court collegium is considering the name of Justice A K Mittal from Punjab & Haryana high court for elevation as chief justice of Delhi.
 
 During her tenure, Justice Rohini delivered several landmark verdicts including the one giving primacy in running Delhi to the lieutenant governor. The judgment broke the governance gridlock that had seized the city due to constant tussle between LG and Kejriwal and is currently in SC.
 
 Justice Rohini also held that the attorney general of India is not a public authority under the Right to Information Act and hence not answerable under the transparency law.
 
 She was also part of the bench that allowed social messaging service WhatsApp to go ahead with its new privacy policy where it shared data with parent company Facebook, noting that users always have the option of deleting the messaging service account. The HC, however, asked government to examine ways in which it can bring such services under the current legal framework.
