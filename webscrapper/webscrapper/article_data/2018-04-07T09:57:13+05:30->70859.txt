 The achievers of world cup competitions and Olympics will be posted in class-I category designations. The sports and youth affairs department has been asked to prepare a detailed list of the sporting events at the international-level that should be considered.
 
 Sports personalities can inform about their preferred district for  . If there is no vacancy in the chosen district, he or she will be appointed to the nearest district available and later will be transferred to the district of his or her choice.
 
 The GAD has set a time frame of four weeks for completing the procedures, especially keeping in mind the fate of sportspersons who achieved accolades in the national games held in the state in January 2015. The government decided to offer jobs for 68 medal winners, but the order based on the cabinet decision of February 3, 2015 was issued a year later (on February 6, 2016). It was again delayed for another year, as the order creating 68 supernumerary posts were issued in 2017.
 
 Victims of disasters, who are given government jobs, also should be appointed in class-III or class-IV categories by creating supernumerary posts, but there should not be any compromise on the minimum educational and other qualifications required, the guidelines said.
