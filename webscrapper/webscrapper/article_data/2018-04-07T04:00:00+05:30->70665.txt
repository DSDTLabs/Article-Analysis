Coimbatore: Even as demand has perked up following the improvement in the fortunes of the automobile industry, foundry units have been hit by high raw material prices. While the prices of iron scrap has gone up by 15%, pet coke rates have seen a 30% surge in the last few months.

 Pig iron prices have hit a decadal high of Rs 36 per kg. “We have seen a 15%-16% increase in raw material prices over the last five months,” said A K Anand, director, The Institute of Indian Foundrymen (IIF). Raw materials account for about 65% of the total production cost of foundries.
 
 IIF officials said that they have not been able to fully pass on the increase in raw material prices to their customers that include automobile companies. Foundry units get Rs 50-55 per kg on an average for their grey iron castings.
 
 Incidentally, the foundry industry’s output increased around 6% year-on-year to 11 million tonnes of castings in 2017, the second largest in the world after China. The industry’s revenues reached a high of $19 billion, which included exports to the tune of $2.7 billion. 
 
 “China is trying to cut production. They are trying to close units that are not environment friendly,” Anand said. “The higher demand for castings has led to an increase in raw material requirements resulting in a price hike,” he said.
 
 “Our growth prospects are quite good for the next 10 years. India would have an edge on the exports front,” senior IIF officials said. “We would be able to register 7%-8% growth this year as key segments that use castings including automobiles, construction equipment and tractors are all doing well,” senior IIF officials said. Though the GST rollout has had a positive impact on the industry, the delay in getting refunds by exporting units has affected the flow of working capital, they said.
