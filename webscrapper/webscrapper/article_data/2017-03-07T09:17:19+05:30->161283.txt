 has taken   by storm with her sheer talent and beauty. The superstar may have attended a zillion shows and walked down many a red carpet for the promotions of her recently released flick 'xXx: Return Of Xander Cage' but sections of foreign media still can't seem to differentiate between her and ‘Baywatch’ star  , who has also carved a niche for herself in the wild wild west. 

  
  
 Sadly enough, the 'Padmavati' actress was again greeted with “Hello Priyanka” when she arrived at the Los Angeles airport recently. Kudos to the actress for maintaining her calm. Deepika quietly walked towards her car and left the airport without posing for the paps. However, this would not be the first time the actress has been mistaken for the 'Quantico' star   Chopra. The actress was addressed as Priyanka during the promotions of her film ‘xXx’ as well.
