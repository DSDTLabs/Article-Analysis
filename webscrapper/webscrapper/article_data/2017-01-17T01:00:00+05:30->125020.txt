Grammy award-winning French DJ and producer David  , who was in India for a multi-city tour, finally performed in Mumbai on Sunday afternoon. The concert was not only postponed from Friday evening to Sunday morning but was also shifted from   to   due to permission issues. David, who has a huge fan following in India, belted out his hits like 'Hey Mama', 'Sexy Bitch' and 'Without You'.
 
 But did he really have the audience grooving? Apparently, not as much. Sources confirmed that the exact number of attendees did not exceed 3,500, even though the tickets for the concert, close to 8,000, were all sold out.  , who attended the concert, says, “He started performing at 2 pm and continued for 90 minutes. Many of us felt that he was not in his element and the Indian DJs performed way better than him. Firstly, the ground was only half full, and thus, the energy was missing. The afternoon timings only made things worse and the laser lights, which are a huge attraction at concerts were ineffective due to the daylight.”
 
 As expected, many involved in the deal suffered huge losses. Some chose to resell the tickets at half the prices. In addition, an after-party, which was to take place at a plush restaurant post the concert on the original day, also had to be called off. However, the Delhi gig somehow held it’s own, probably owing to the evening schedule and fewer glitches.
