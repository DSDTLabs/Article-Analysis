 Vijay was arrested by   police last year keeping with him 40 banned injections. 
 
 "On October 11, 2016, we had arrested Vijay for having in his custody 20 injections of   and 20 injections of Buprenorphine. He failed to show a valid license or permit for the same and a case was registered against him under the NDPS Act," the cops said.
 
 The convict started behaving suspiciously after seeing a police patrolling party. 
 
 "After nabbing him, we seized 40 injections for which he failed to produce any permit or licence," the cops said.
 
 In the court, Vijay's counsel argued that he was falsely being implicated by the police. However, the court found him guilty and sentenced him to one-year jail after failing to get any supporting evidence.
