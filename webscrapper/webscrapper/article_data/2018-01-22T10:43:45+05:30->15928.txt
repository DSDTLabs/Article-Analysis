Two British Sikhs —   and   Singh Bahia — who cofounded Midland Langar Sewa Society (MLSS) which serves free food to the needy and hungry in different parts of the UK — have been picked up as Points of Light, a programme under which British PM recognizes volunteers who are making a change in their community.

 “You and Parmjit have shown tremendous innovation and commitment in helping some of society’s most vulnerable citizens. By providing hot meals and vital support in over 17 different towns and cities around the UK, as well as abroad, your work with the ‘Midland Langar Seva Society’ is supporting the lives of thousands of homeless people across the world,” wrote PM   in a letter to Heer on January 9.
 
 In a letter to Bahia, PM said, “Through the ‘Midland Langar Seva Society’, you have given one million hot meals to homeless people living around the world. Your tireless volunteer work is making a real difference to disadvantaged members of society, particularly in Walsall, while promoting the concept of dasvand.”
 
 Dasvand is a Sikh concept in which 10% of the income is contributed towards philanthropic activities.
 
 Started in October 2013, in November 2017, the   started the ‘Guru Nanak Dev Ji's Langar Bus’ on the birth anniversary of founder of Sikhism. The bus has a built-in kitchen and takes langar to the homeless/ needy throughout UK.
 
 “This was a dream project, now we ca go amid the homeless or needy. We intend to cover the entire UK with this,” Heer told TOI on phone from UK.
 
 While they opened a chapter in Germany only a few days back, Randhir and Paramjit organized a trip to Mumbai where MLSS team-Hazoor Sahib and MLSS team-Mumbai were launched. “The Mumbai team will be serving Langar outside hospitals and undertake community and aid work wherever required,” Heer said.
 
 They were among the top 10 finalists for Pride of Britain Awards. Illustrated advertisements of   and   serving langar were run on national television networks for weeks.
