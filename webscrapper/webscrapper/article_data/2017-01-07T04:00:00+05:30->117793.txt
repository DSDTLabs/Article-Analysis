VADODARA: The   (VMC) is set to cancel the lease of 21   operating from gardens of the civic body. The decision has been taken in wake of repeated representations questioning the procedures and the amount being charged as lease from these establishments.

 The civic body over a period of time had given space at its gardens for the parlours that are now doing brisk business. 
 
 The VMC has given these parlours at an annual lease of Rs 85,800 with an annual escalation of 10 per cent. A series of other conditions were imposed on the parlours and Rs one lakh deposit was taken for each of these.
 
 The civic body decided to review the lease when a proposal of extending the lease of two such parlours of the Baroda Dairy at Vadiwadi and railway station areas came up. It was also decided to terminate the current lease in wake of a series of issues.
 
 Sources in the civic body said that one of the major concerns was that the lease amount was very low even for parlous located at prime locations. 
 
 While the lease was given in the name of providing facilities to users of gardens at several locations, the parlours were actually facing the main roads with the gardens on their rear side.
 
 “We are examining several procedural issues that need to be looked into regarding the lease agreements. These include the amounts charged for these parlous,” said   Dr Vinod Rao.
