NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Monday asked   for chief minister   not to   in a   while   union minister Arun  .

 Taking charge of the cross examination process transferred out from the joint registrar, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw also objected to “suggestive questions” being thrown at the finance minister.
 
 Jaitley is being cross examined in a defamation case filed by him against Kejriwal and other AAP leaders.
 
 Justice Endlaw reminded senior lawyer Anoop George Chaudhari that “excessive cross-examination was harmful” as it “never helps the cross-examiner” and noted that in the present case “the object appeared only to cross-examine rather than arriving at a result.”
 
 HC asked Chaudhari to look again at the questions for Jaitley’s cross-examination and formulate them “properly” so the proceedings can go on without interruptions, indicating that Kejriwal’s lawyers must ensure that the cross-examination concludes on the next date of hearing on February 20.
 
 Jaitley has filed a Rs 10 crore defamation suit against Kejriwal, Raghav Chadha, Kumar Vishwas, Sanjay Singh, Ashutosh and Deepak Bajpai. It came in response to their allegations of financial irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) when Jaitley was its president.
 
 Chaudhari, briefed by advocate Anupam Srivastav, told the court that queries posed during earlier cross-examinations were asked as Jaitley had denied being part of the committee which oversaw the re-construction of the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium where the alleged bungling took place.
 
 Jaitley said the contract for the stadium was given to the Engineering Projects India Ltd as its bid was the lowest and it was a public sector undertaking. He had explained that DDCA decided to build the stadium with its own resources.
 
 Last week, HC had criticised Kejriwal over the relevance of questions put to Jaitley and said the chief minister was engaging in a "roving and fishing enquiry".
