ALWAR: Dr Karan Singh Yadav, Congress candidate for bypoll from Alwar parliamentary seat would file his nomination on January 8 in the presence of former chief minister  , PCC president  , former Union minister Jitendra Singh, and AICC secretary Devendra Yadav among others.

 While Congress took an early lead in campaigning by announcing its candidate in advance, BJP is yet to announce its nominee. 
 
 Party leaders and workers would take out a rally from party office at   to file nomination followed by a meeting addressed by top leaders, said former Union minister Jitendra Singh after inaugurating the party election office on Saturday.
 
 He said this time the party focus would be on door-to-door-campaigning rather than holding public meetings. It will help party to establish direct contact with voters. Even party’s senior leaders would follow suit, he said.
 
 He accused the BJP government of step-motherly treatment to Alwar. “BJP government halted big ticket projects like Mero, ESI Medical College, Army School and drinking water project from Chambal in the district,” alleged Singh.
 
 Congress president Rahul Gandhi, opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha Gulam Nabi Azad, Raj Babbar, former CM Ashok Gehlot and PCC president Sachin Pilot would campaign for the party candidate, Singh added.
 
 He said legal cells have been constituted for the eight assembly segments under Alwar parliamentary seat to keep a tab on any misuse of government machinery by the ruling party and take remedial action.
 
 Taking a dig at the ruling party, Singh said that BJP is struggling to name a candidate in Alwar and many leaders of the saffron party have started campaigning declaring themselves as candidates. People would not allow BJP candidates to enter their villages as the government had blocked major projects in Alwar, he alleged.
