Trichy: Every year Aadi Amavasai marks a family get-together for S Ramalingam from Raghavendra Nagar in Srirangam, as a dozen of his relatives from Coimbatore come to offer their prayers at Amma Mandapam.

 However, they chose to offer prayers to their ancestors at Rameswaram this year. Taking a holy dip in a river and tharpanam ritual is integral to the event. As Cauvery has gone bone dry this year, a majority of outsiders chose to skip Amma Mandapam situated on the banks of Cauvery in Srirangam.
 
 It was the same case last year too, but there was at least some flow then. However, now the riverbed resembles a desert. Normally large crowds throng Amma Mandapam on the first no moon day of the Tamil month of Aadi (Aadi Amavasai), but there was a considerable fall in numbers on Sunday.
 
 People opted for sea shore places like Rameswaram this year, even though authorities had made the necessary arrangements to ensure people offer prayers and take a holy bath.
 
 The civic body had installed artificial showers at Amma Mandapam by providing water through borewells. Water from the well was used in 50 shower points, 20 for women and 30 for men installed at the river bank. Besides, 10 more shower points were installed at the river bed to ensure that people take bath after their prayers. 
 
 “Without water in Cauvery, the tharpanam ritual will be incomplete,” said Ramalingam adding that many chose to visit Rameswaram this year. 
 
 “The crowd consisted mostly of local people this year, otherwise large queues of vehicles and devotees could be seen right from early hours,” said police officials. But Aadi Perukku is the main event which falls on August 3 will invit large crowd of newly married couple to the spot.
