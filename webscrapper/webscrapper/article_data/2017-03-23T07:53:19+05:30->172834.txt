CHENNAI: Lakes in   are under severe threat due to dumping of   and   by IT firms located inside the   (MEPZ) and government hospitals in the   area. 

 'Erichuvadugal', a documentary by students of Madras School of Social Work and released on Wednesday on the occasion of World Water Day at the MSSW campus, showed that groundwater around the Thiruneermalai lake, Veeraraghavan lake and Kadapperi had been rendered unfit due to illegal dumping.
 
 Sowmya Anbumani, president of Pasumai Thayagam, and NGO, and wife of former Union minister Anbumani Ramadas, appealed to authorities to rescue the water bodies that were encroached upon and polluted due to neglect over the last 20 years. 
 
  Sekar, a farmer, said the Thiruneermalai lake had been turned into a large septic tank. "It was a favourite for migratory birds until the 1980s."
 
  A private IT firm, with 16,000 employees, had been dumping waste in the lake since 2014 after its sewage treatment plant shut. 
 
 Waste from the   quarters nearby was also dumped in the lake. The documentary claims the catchment areas, under the PWD, were encroached upon by a 32-block residential township.
 
 Untreated effluents were released from local tanneries at the point where the lake meets the Adyar river. The Veeraraghavan lake which drains into the Thiruneermalai lake has shrunk from 25 acres to eight acres due to encroachment.
