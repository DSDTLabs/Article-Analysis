PANAJI: When the over 13 km-long new   project along with its approach roads is ready, it is likely that commuters will have to pay toll to use this new infrastructure. A   is part of the project from the conceptualisation stage and the land being acquired for the project also includes land for it.

 “Along with land for rehabilitation of the families that will be displaced by the new Zuari bridge construction, land is also being acquired for the toll plaza. As the central government will fund construction of the bridge, it is likely to collect user fee for use of the bridge,” said a source.
 
 But it will be purely at the discretion of the Union ministry for road transport and highways (MoRTH) to decide on collection of the toll. 
 
 The central government is spending around Rs 1,403.1 crore in all for the construction of the new Zuari bridge. This amount excludes the cost of land acquisition.
 
 The cable stayed bridge and its approach roads are being constructed in three phases. Package I includes the construction of the approaches on the northern end of the bridge at a cost of Rs 440.10 crore. It also includes construction of the toll plaza as part of the contract. Package II will have construction of the actual cable stayed bridge along with the approach stretches connecting the bridge to the approach roads. The package III will be construction of the south approaches to the bridge at a cost of Rs 417.60.
 
 An exemption or concession on the toll payment for Goans is being considered.
 
 The new Zuari bridge is coming up on NH-17/NH 66 on   section.
 
 Once the new bridge is constructed, the present bridge across   is likely to be utilised for movement of light vehicles. 
 
 Movement of heavy vehicles on the existing bridge has been prohibited since the 1990s in view of its condition. The present bridge is two laned, while the new bridge will be have eight-lanes keeping in mind the projection of traffic growth in the coming years.
