CHANDIGARH: Three unidentified men, purportedly from Canada, have issued video threats to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder and Congress   MP Ravneet Bittu for dubbing Canadian defence minister   ahead of his trip to India last month. 

 A major controversy had erupted after Amarinder publically announced that he wouldn't meet Sajjan during his visit to Punjab in April, and termed all five Sikh ministers in   government in Canada as Khalistani sympathisers.
 
 These videos have been uploaded on social media websites. This comes barely two days after   and Punjab police arrested two Sikhs near the India-Pak border who were allegedly part of a plan to revive militancy in India with the help of Pakistan. In the videos, a turbanless, bearded man from a rights group is seen making disdainful remarks about former chief minister Beant Singh who was assassinated, and his grandson Bittu.
