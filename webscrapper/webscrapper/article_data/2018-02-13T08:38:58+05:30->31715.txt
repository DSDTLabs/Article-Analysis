CHENNAI: Having failed to protect temple lands continuously, the Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments department should at least now put in efforts to recover more than 50,000 acres of encroached  , said Madras high court on Monday.

 Justice R Mahadevan, relying on a recent survey which revealed that out of 5.25 lakh acres of temple land on record a few years ago, only 4.78 acres existed now, directed the department to issue public notices informing the persons in possession of such properties to voluntarily surrender them to avoid penal action.
 
 “No doubt, the HR&CE being the competent authority to regulate the affairs of the temples in the state, and having failed continuously for a considerable amount of time, should now take appropriate steps to retrieve such properties,” said the judge.
 
 “Properties of religious institutions, more particularly temple properties, have to be maintained properly in order to derive more income to spend for the betterment of temples. It is very pertinent to point out that when the properties belonging to temples are not properly maintained, then the revenue cannot be derived therefrom and it would not be in the interest of such temples,” he said.
 
 The issue pertains to a petition moved by trustees of Arulmighu Avudainayagi Ambal Sametha Desiganatha Swami Temple in   district seeking to recover temple properties.
 
 Allowing the plea, the court directed the assistant commissioner of HR&CE in Paramakudi to conduct an inquiry and take steps to recover the properties, after giving opportunity to all the parties concerned.
 
 The judge also asked the department to prepare a report specifying details of temple land across the state, for which patta had been granted to third parties. A report shall be filed in four weeks disclosing the lands, details of sanction granted for alienating such properties, and to constitute committees in each region to visit all temples to identify encroached land and file a report in the court in six weeks.
