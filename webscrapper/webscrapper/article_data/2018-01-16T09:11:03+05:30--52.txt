AGARTALA: A day after six Rohingya minors were detained by the   (RPF) at   railway station, a local court in North Tripura on Monday sent the minors to homes for the following 10 days. 

 Identified as Dil Ara (17), Ibrahim (17), Md Jahangir Hossain (17), Ashim (15), Jannat Ara (14) and Nur Fatema (13), they had all fled Myanmar after their parents were killed by Myanmar army in 2012, police said. Ashim was the first to cross the border to India and take up a job in Hyderabad while the rest had made their way to Bangladesh, police added.
 
 Not conversant in Bengali, Hindi or English and without a passport, the entry of the five minors from Bangladesh into India would be difficult. Ashim got in touch with a local trader in Sonamura who agreed to help him cross the border and bring them back to India against payment, police said. "On January 10, Ashim crossed over to Tripura with the five others via Sonamura and reached Agartala. On January 12, they travelled to Dharmanagar and were caught at the railway station," a police officer said.
 
 The RPF, which picked them up, said they were not involved in any criminal activity besides crossing the border illegally. 
 
 "Such illegal cross-border activity has become all too common. Several gold smugglers, fake passport dealers and illegal migrants have been caught but no strict action is taken to prevent such incidents," a senior police officer said.
