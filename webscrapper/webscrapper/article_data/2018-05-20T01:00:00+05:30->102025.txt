It was masti time for the members of a social club when a   theme party was organized, recently. Mukul and his wife   played an important role in organising the do and were seen welcoming the guests.
As soon as the DJ started belting out latest Bollywood remixes, everyone was on the dance floor. Bhumika and   were the most enthusiastic dancers. The couple danced to 'Ae Kya Bolti Tu' and ' ' with gusto and were cheered on by their friends.
