Gandhinagar: Congress MLAs on Thursday demanded that the state government should have some funds reserved for former MLAs who in their last stages of life find it difficult to survive. Leader of opposition Shankersinh Vaghela, condoling the death of former MLA Kanubhai Jivram Vasava, said that when Vasava died his family did not have money even for his funeral and it was his neighbours who helped the family in cremation. He said that for such honest MLAs, there should be a fund to help them survive. Later during the debate on the general administration department, senior Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil demanded that the minister should cut on their expenses and in fact use the amount saved to give full salary to the Asha workers who are agitating in the state. Gohil said that â€œa minister or the chief minister is supposed to travel in an economy class and if he wants to travel by business class, he has to pay the difference amount from his pocket but the present ministers and chief minister prefer to travel by planes owned by private companies. tnn
