KOLKATA: The   tunnel is expected to reach the Hooghly riverbed on the Howrah end by next month. The   (TBM) was "initiated" for the last leg of the   on Tuesday night. 

 It will drill through the riverbed under Howrah station and cover 130m to reach the river point.   (KMRC), which is executing the grand connection between Howrah and Kolkata, is now examining and repairing the giant machine to avoid any glitch during the 25-week construction of the tunnel under the river. The river tunnel is expected to reach the spot marked for Mahakaran station by August or September.
 
 KMRC chief engineer Biswanath Dewanjee said, "Currently, the TBM is being refurbished. It's perfect working should be ensured before it is taken to the river as any technical snag cannot be repaired once it's 13m deep in the water."
