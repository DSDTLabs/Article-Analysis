 Lack of safety measures claimed the lives of two poor workers, Santosh,28 and Vijay,25, engaged in cleaning an underground water supply trunk line. The workers were hired by Larsen & Toubro to attend to works related to an inspection chamber of a drinking water pipeline near   here on Wednesday.
 
 Inspection chamber is an access point to an underground valve of the pipeline for maintaining water pressure in the pipeline. The two workers went inside the chamber without precautionary gear like oxygen masks. They died of asphyxiation.
 
 Safety rules prescribe that once the lid of the valve chamber is lifted, workers should enter it only after a gap of 15 minutes. This will allow enough circulation of oxygen and removal of poisonous gases, if any. The workers entered the chamber immediately after opening the lid. “Had the workers waited for at least 10 minutes, the tragedy would have been avoided,” said Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) technical director  .
 
 “When I went inside the chamber to pull out the bodies, I felt suffocated. ,” said P Mahesh, a worker.
