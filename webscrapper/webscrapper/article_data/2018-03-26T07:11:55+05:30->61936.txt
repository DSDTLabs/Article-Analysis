RANCHI: Doctors treating   (RJD) supremo   on Sunday found him happy and cheerful as usual a day after he was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. 

 When doctors treating   visited him at his cabin in the super-specialty wing of   (Rims) on Sunday morning, the incarcerated former Bihar chief minister was 'lively and chirpy as usual', showing no signs of stress despite being handed a landmark jail term just a day before. 
 
 "People are normally shaken up after being sentenced to jail. But Lalu ji is very deceptive and does not let one know about his feelings. He was lively and chirpy as usual and did not let us know what was going on in his mind," Dr Umesh Prasad, under whom Lalu is undergoing treatment, said. 
 
 "Lalu ji successfully concealed his emotions infront of actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha when the latter met him at the hospital on Saturday too," a doctor of the hospital's medical board monitoring Lalu's health told TOI. 
 
 So far, the former Bihar CM has spent more than a week in the hospital. He was admitted with a perianal abscess. Though the infection had healed, doctors have kept him under watch for high blood pressure, blood sugar and serum creatinine levels. 
 
 "His blood sugar levels are high. We have been pestering him to take insulin injections but he insisted on continuing with oral drugs," Dr Prasad said. 
 
 Lalu also told his concerned doctors that he will take up morning walks after returning to   central jail for keeping his diabetes in check. 
 
 Lalu is serving a jail term in Ranchi since January 6 after being found guilty in two fodder scam cases. 
 
 In the latest case, the special CBI court has sentenced him to seven years imprisonment each on two counts. For the first time, Lalu is set to serve the sentences consecutively. In the earlier sentences, he was serving them concurrently.
