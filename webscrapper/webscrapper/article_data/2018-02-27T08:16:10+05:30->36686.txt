PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited on Monday reduced the price of senior citizens’ monthly bus passes — the first rollback of a decision taken by  , the former chairman and managing director of the transport body.

 The senior citizens’ monthly pass will cost Rs 500. Mundhe had increased the price from Rs 450 to Rs 700 in August last year. The decision was taken in a meeting of the PMPML’s board of directors.
 
 They also restarted the daily passes for students, said Subhash Gaikwad, public relations officer of the transport body.
 
 Mundhe had made many changes in the   system. The price of daily passes was increased from Rs50 to Rs70. The monthly pass rates were increased from Rs1,200 to Rs1,400 and the monthly students’ pass price was hiked from Rs600 to Rs750. The punching pass, also called one-route pass, was stopped.
 
 Welcoming the moves,  , secretary of the PMP Pravasi Manch, told TOI, “There was no need to increase the rates of the passes. We had requested Mundhe to revert it but he had not agreed.”
 
 The new   chairperson and managing director,  , indicated that the PMPML could ply air-conditioned buses soon. “We will look into all the legalities first and study them. Then the proposal will come again before the board. There has been a plan to lease 550 AC buses for commuters,” she said, adding that the tender process for purchasing 800 standard buses would be finalized by the next month.
