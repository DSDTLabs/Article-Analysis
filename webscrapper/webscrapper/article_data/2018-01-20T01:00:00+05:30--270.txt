A few days ago, BT had reported how the lead pair of 'Aisi Deewangi... Dekhi Nahi Kahi' —   and   — quit the show together, alleging inhuman treatment and mental harassment at the hands of its makers.

 And now, we have been informed that the daily soap is shutting down abruptly. While the shoot will wrap up in a couple of days, the daily soap will go off air on February 2.
 
 A source says, “The show has been doing well and the original plan was to shift it to a late-evening slot and replace it with a new family drama. However, the allegations of makers treating the cast inhumanly, triggered the decision to end 'Aisi Deewangi...' The channel wasn’t too happy with the way the production house was functioning either. In fact, the producers requested the Cine And TV Artists’ Association ( ) to convince the lead couple of the show to sign a contract that they will shoot till March 9, following a meeting between the association and the producers on January 10. So, the decision to end the show is definitely abrupt.”
 
 As far as the dispute between the lead actors and the makers is concerned, CINTAA had asked the producers to hand out post-dated cheques, which hasn’t been done yet. “Jyoti and Pranav will be forced to take action if the producers don’t hand out cheques as asked by the association,” adds the source. 
 
 Both actors and the producers refused to comment on the news.
