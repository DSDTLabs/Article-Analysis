 Many felt that the question paper was tricky and had no connect with patterns of previous years. Some students said many sentences were confusing as instructions lacked clarity. However, they were of the view that those who were thorough with their textbooks, were able to attempt all questions. Rumours of paper leak and re-examination further disturbed the students after they came out of examination hall. It was observed that the leaked version matched the set II of the   question paper.
