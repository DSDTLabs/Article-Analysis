BHOPAL: Watch out for protruding handles of the dustbins put by the   on the roadsides in the state capital. Made to fit the holder of   vehicles, these bins are a clear danger that is being overlooked by the civic body who is up and about to improve its 'Swach' status. 

 While driving, one can dangerously fall on the slippery garbage spilled over the road. Then green or blue shaded dustbins do not easily catch one's attention while driving. "My friend was avoiding a speedy vehicle and slowed to his left. The holder of the bin missed us by a whisker. It could have turned out to be death trap," said  , a resident of  .
 
 Extended appendages (holders) on these bins are meant to lift the bin when it is emptied into the garbage vehicle. At almost every location, these bins are misplaced and are places by the sides of traffic intensive roads. "We instruct the drivers and helpers to place the bin in such a way that the arms are not facing the traffic. But it's not always followed," said BMC area health officer at New Market.
 
 A dustbin put just outside the house of the BMC chairman  , is a perfect example of the miserable situation. Littered with waste, two bins are put at a distance less than 100 metres. 
 
 "We have complained on the CM helpline for the bin needs to be removed. Garbage burn has engulfed the green cover in the area. We have lost over a dozen trees.," said a representative of private hospital at Rang Mahal square.
 
 Burning of bins is not limited to the metal framed bins. Plastic bins put at various intersections are burnt on regular basis. Placing metallic open bins in commercial area along the pedestrian pathway has also been criticised by the experts. Sponsored by a private agency, the size of the bin is that of a 25-litre bucket. They are kept open and can cause serious injuries in case of an accident.
