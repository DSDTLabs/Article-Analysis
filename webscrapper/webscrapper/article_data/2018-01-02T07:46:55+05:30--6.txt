CHANDIGARH: In a verdict having huge ramifications for trained graduate teachers (TGT) working in the state-run schools in Haryana, the   and   high court has held that they can be promoted to post graduate teacher ( ) “only if they possess a post-graduation degree in which they are presently teaching”.

 The HC made it clear that the   (Group ‘B’) Service Rules, 2012 would apply for filling up the PGT vacancy posts even those which occurred prior to the promulgation of the 2012 rules.
 
 Justice Amol Rattan   passed these orders while disposing of petitions filed by several TGTs seeking promotion as PGTs on the ground that vacancies to promotional posts occurred prior to the promulgation of the new rules. The petitioners were eligible for promotion in the subjects they have the PG degrees, even if they had not taught those subjects as TGTs/masters, according to old rules of 1998, they are now not eligible as per the rules of 2012.
 
 “It would be irrational for this court to direct that the higher posts be filled in even by those who have no teaching experience in that particular subject on the lower post, or have no PG degree in that specific subject. Obviously, the improvement stipulated in new rules is for the benefit of students, and this court would therefore loath to interfere with better standards of education for students,” Justice Singh held in his recent verdict.
 
 The court, however, has granted four-year time to all those who were eligible as per 1998 rules, to obtain post graduate qualifications in subjects that they are teaching on the lower posts (TGTs/masters/mistresses) as also to qualify for the Haryana Teachers Eligibility Test (HTET) within the said period.
 
 The HC also held that alternatively, subject to posts being available, the TGTs who have PG degrees in subjects other than those in which they are teaching, may opt to be transferred to the cadre/sub-cadre of the TGTs in the subject that they have obtained such PG degree in, and upon completing two years of teaching experience, they would then be eligible for promotion as PGTs in that very subject.
 
 Thus, if a TGT (mathematics) had acquired a PG degree in English, he/she may opt for being posted as a TGT (English), if posts are available in that subject, and upon gaining two years’ experience, can be considered for promotion in the same manner, to the post of a PGT (English).
