PUNE: A teacher at a school in Bhosari, Pune district, beat up a six-year-old Class I student at   for making a spelling mistake in his class workbook. The incident took place earlier this week. 

 
 The teacher banged the hapless student's head on the bench before beating him with a duster and stick inside the classroom, police said. The boy sustained injuries to his head and back, and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment; he was discharged later.
 
 The boy's father lodged a complaint against the teacher and handed over the hospital's medical report to the Bhosari police. An offence punishable under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered.
 
 Sanjay Patil, a senior official of the school, told TOI, "We learned about the incident after the police complaint. We will speak to the teacher concerned and the students who were present, and will take an overall review before deciding on any action."
 
 "My son has been admitted to the hospital again. I am not in a position to speak about the incident right now," the boy's father said on Sunday.
 
 In his complaint, the father said he had gone to the school around 3.15pm on Thursday to pick up his son. While they were on their way home, the boy told him that a teacher had beaten him up for having misspelt a word when writing, the complaint stated. The father checked the boy's head and found it had swollen. He then took him to hospital for treatment. After his shirt was taken off, it was noticed that the child's back was bruised black and blue. The Bhosari police said they are investigating the matter and would record statements of the boy and of the others concerned with the issue.
