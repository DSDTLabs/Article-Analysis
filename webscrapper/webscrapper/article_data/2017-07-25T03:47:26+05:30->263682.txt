NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson   asked the government on Monday to take “very seriously” the issue of substandard and unhygienic food being served by the Indian Railways, as was highlighted in a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India tabled in   last week.

 This came after   MP Rewati Raman Singh raised the matter during Zero Hour, holding that while the government had massively hiked fares of trains, the substandard food being served was being “cooked in dirty water”.
