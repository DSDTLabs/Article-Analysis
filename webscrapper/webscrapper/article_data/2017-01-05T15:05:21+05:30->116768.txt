With ‘Raees’ all set to release in two weeks,   is busy with promotions. The film, which has quite a bit of action, is one of the most anticipated releases of 2017. Speaking to a daily, Shah Rukh said, “There are five big action set pieces in the film. We have an entire parkour sequence, we have a very sadak-chhaap fight, which is how roadside gundas fight. That sounds funny, but it’s very intense. There’s an entire action sequence while the Laila song is playing, which is quite interesting. It’s about a minute-and-a-half long. There’s another cool action scene with the bad guy. It’s more of a gun-wielding fight. There’s one during a rally, so it has a political fight as well. And then there’s obviously the fight during the climax. I got to do almost everything in the film. The film’s director   and I tried to ensure that none of the fight scenes look or feel the same. Each one has a flavour of its own. What we tried to do is give every fight a different meaning, a different touch, so there’s a distinct kind of musical background in every fight, but it’s a fight at the end of it all.”

 Talking about the time when he didn’t want to play romantic characters, he said, “I wanted to be a macho man on screen. I always wanted to be an action hero. But it still hasn’t happened. Filmmakers still don’t offer me cool action films. Because of my repertoire, maybe, directors don’t consider me an option. But I am very macho at heart.”
