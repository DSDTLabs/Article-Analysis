CHARMINAR: The seventh additional metropolitan sessions court has asked for an extension to pass a verdict on the case of murderous attack on   (MIM) legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi. The   had set the deadline for completion of the trial on January 21, 2017. 

 In November last year, a division bench comprising Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar and Justice Arun Misra of the apex court have directed the sessions court in Hyderabad to complete the trial in Akbaruddin Owaisi attack case within three months.
 
 The sessions court has to examine 22 more witnesses in the case which is progressing on a day-to-day basis. The final arguments between the special public prosecutor and defence counsels are likely to take more than a month's time. Till now 39 witnesses have been examined including Owaisi.
 
 The trial court had earlier sought extension upon which the Supreme Court on June 6, 2016 extended time for a further period of three months to complete the trial. Due to certain unavoidable conditions the sessions court could not complete the trial process.
 
 On April 30, 2011, Mohammed Bin Omer Yafai and other members of his family allegedly attacked the MIM leader in Barkas. After the attack, the Chandrayangutta police slapped cases on 13 people under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 147 (Rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapon) and 307 (attempt to murder).
 
 Former MIM corporator Mansoor Bin Mohammed Awalgi is the complainant in the case. Later the investigation of the case was handed over to the   (CCS) and a charge sheet was also filed against the accused.
