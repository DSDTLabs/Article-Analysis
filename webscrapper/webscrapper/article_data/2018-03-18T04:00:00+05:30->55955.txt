Vadodara: Had architect Robert Chisholm not made this building so grand and beautiful, it could well have been a vegetable market! Nyay Mandir, located right opposite the Sursagar lake, has an interesting history.Chisholm designed the two-storeyed structure – built in 1896 – so exquisitely that Sayajirao III changed his mind midway and decided to make it the town hall. The campus, built at a cost of Rs 7 lakh then, was later turned into a court. The building was named Chimnabai Nyay Mandir after Sayajirao’s first wife.

 Spread over four acres, Nyay Mandir is a piece of Moorish architecture that has trellis (jaali work) and lot of other ventilation. It also has elements of Mughal architecture.
 
 A huge hall at the centre of Nyay Mandir has a marble statue of Chimnabai placed at the southern end. A big gate outside the main entrance enhanced the beauty of the building, which has 28 rooms, for 122 years. The exterior is made of small Italian ceramic tiles while the central hall is decorated with mosaic.
