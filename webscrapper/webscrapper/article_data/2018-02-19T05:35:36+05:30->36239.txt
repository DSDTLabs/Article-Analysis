 Tipu, who has criminal antecedents and was arrested earlier, paid no heed to the rebuke and continued to create a ruckus. When a few others came out as well, he left the spot. However, he returned with a few men and started hurling bombs at the locals. He left the spot when none of the bombs burst. A number of residents had come out by then to search for the bombs. Tipu came back to the spot a second time with arms and opened fire at the gathering.
 
 Arju was shot in his stomach and fell on the ground. He was taken to a hospital by his neighbours.
 
 According to sources, Tipu is a known anti-social and had earlier been arrested for disturbing and threatening local residents. He is also linked to illegal promoting rackets and syndicates supplying building materials.
 
 Convent Road has been in the eye of the storm last year as well when a local was shot at by miscreants at night.
