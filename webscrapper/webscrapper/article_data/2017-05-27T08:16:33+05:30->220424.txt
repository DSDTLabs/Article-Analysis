CHENNAI:   are likely to rope in Brazil's Olympic winning coach   for the forthcoming season. The buzz is that the 48-year-old coach is in advanced talks with the former   champions and a deal might be in place soon.

 Micale has an enviable CV and he has the experience of working with the likes of Neymar, Rafinha and Gabriel Jesus while guiding Brazil to their maiden and much-coveted Olympic gold last year. He has also coached the Brazilian U-23 and U-20 sides apart from managing Gremio Baruer, Figueirense and the youth sides of  . However, his reputation took a hit recently when Brazil failed to qualify for the Under-20 World Cup and he was subsequently sacked. A source said that the sack prompted Micale to look for other avenues.
 
 Earlier this year, Chennaiyin parted ways with Italian World Cup winner  , who had coached the side for the first three ISL seasons. Materazzi had also guided Chennaiyin to the title in the second season.
 
 Micale, a former goalkeeper, has the experience of coaching youth teams across Brazil for more than 15 years. With Chennnaiyin having a lot of youngsters in their squad, it is believed that the former goalkeeper will fit into the role suitably. "Materazzi was a popular figure among the players for his man management skills. Micale is also known to have such qualities. He likes to focus on building players' characters and talk about strategy. He is also a strict disciplinarian. So his skills will definitely come in handy," said the source.
