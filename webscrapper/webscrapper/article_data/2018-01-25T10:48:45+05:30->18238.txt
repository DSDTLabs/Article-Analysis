KANYAKUMARI: As part of efforts to bring down road accident deaths, Kanyakumari district police have recommended cancellation of the licence of 1,520 two-wheeler riders who were caught for drunk driving and speeding. District superintendent of police (SP) N Sreenatha said that the recommendations had been sent to the respective regional transport offices.

 The SP told reporters here that 13,179 helmet violation cases were registered from New Year till Tuesday and that vehicle checks would be intensified. He said that four special patrol teams had been deployed to check chain snatching in Nagercoil town. This had yielded results as three chain snatchers were nabbed in the last one week. Sreenatha added that the police had listed 136 rowdy elements and history-sheeters categorising them as A (27), B (68) and C (41) based on the gravity of offences committed and number of cases and natures of cases against them. “They are under police scanner round-the-clock,” he said. Police were also speeding up filing of charge sheets in pending cases, he said.
 
 On decongesting the narrow roads in the thickly populated Nagercoil town and other town and tourist spots across the district, the SP said that the decision on making the busy roads one-way will be taken after discussing with the traders, public representatives and other stakeholders.
