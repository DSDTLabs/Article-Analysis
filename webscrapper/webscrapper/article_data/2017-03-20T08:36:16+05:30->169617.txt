LUCKNOW/ NEW DELHI: Yogi Adityanath’s   led to a mad scramble of seats on all   to Lucknow on Sunday.

 To ensure that no one was left out, state-owned Air India deployed its biggest aircraft, the 423-seater   747, on this route, which went with little less than half its seats full. Former Congressman N D Tiwari was the closest to a VIP on that flight.
 
 With no B-777 available at such a short notice, the Maharaja operated the less-used Jumbo Jet to Lucknow at 9 am with 200 people on board.
 
 The Boeing 747, which ferries the President, Prime Minister and VP on long international flights, could not have operated with a full load of 423 passengers on the relatively small runway at Amausi. It operated with what is called “load penalty” – when an aircraft has to fly with a limited load by flying some seats empty and carrying less cargo – to operate on a smaller-than-required runway or on very hot summer days.
 
 The decision to deploy a big plane was taken as the top Central leadership did not want any person, who wanted to attend the swearing-in, to be left out in Delhi for want of an airline seat.
 
 “We are told that most   had made their own arrangement and many had arrived early morning by train,” an airport official privy to the development told TOI. Lucknow airport director P K Srivastava confirmed the Boeing 747 landed with only 200 passengers. “But for N D Tewari, no important delegate arrived on the plane,” said an airport official.
