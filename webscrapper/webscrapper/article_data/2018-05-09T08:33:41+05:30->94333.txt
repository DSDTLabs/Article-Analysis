HYDERABAD: State-run   (OGH) has over 10 blind spots within its campus where not a single person ventures after dusk. Every morning, empty alcohol bottles are found all over the area. In the absence of proper monitoring and checking by security guards, miscreants and alcoholics gain free entry, junior doctors complained.

 “Such activities make the campus unsafe for patients, especially women, including staff. Although the security guards are aware of such ‘vulnerable’ spots, there is absolutely no checking or patrolling at night,” said a woman resident doctor.
 
  
 The fact that the hospital has multiple entry points, makes it difficult to control the menace. There are five entry gates that are largely unguarded, leaving it susceptible to illegal entries.
 
 However, insiders blame the ‘corrupt’ guards for such illegal activities in a government hospital. “Even if the guards notice that people have come inside with alcohol or are drinking in a secluded corner, they let them continue so. They ask for Rs 10-Rs 20 as bribe and then go about their work as if they saw nothing. They have got used to taking bribes and do not let go of any opportunity,” added the   member.
