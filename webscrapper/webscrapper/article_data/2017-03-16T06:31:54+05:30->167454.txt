AHMEDABAD: To protect citizens from the adverse impact of heat, the   ( ) will implement its Heat Action Plan from the first week of April. Civic authorities have included the setting up of ‘cool roofs’ as part of the plan. According to the civic body’ data, the city suffered a major heat wave in May 2010, which led to 1,344 deaths registered in the city in May 2010 alone.

 “According to the seasonal heat outlook released by the   (IMD), this time around there would be higher anomalies in maximum temperatures which may worsen the daytime temperatures in summer,” said Abhiyant Tiwari, a public health researcher, the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar (IIPHG). “At the same time, higher anomalies in minimum temperatures will also cause nights to be hotter than usual. Therefore it is extremely important to work on bringing down indoor temperatures.”
 
 Civic authorities said that cool roofs will help keep indoor temperatures down. Tiwari said, “The idea is to make housing conditions conducive to bear the heat by bringing down temperatures.” There are several ways to achieve this which include false ceilings and using roof shingles made of processed clay. “Earlier, this was a common practice which has now faded,” he said.
 
 Apart from that, the civic body also plans to mobilize a larger force of grassroots health workers to help tackle the situation in slum areas as well. “Activities related to awareness, issuing alerts via SMS and coming up with television commercials to help tackle heat-related illnesses will be undertaken by officials,” said a senior AMC health official.
