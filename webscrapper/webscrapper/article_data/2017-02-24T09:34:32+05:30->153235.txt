 The suspects were determined not to give in without a fight when police officials led by   barged into the courtroom and tried to remove them forcefully . “They came to surrender at the court.After asking them to stay inside the dock, I went inside the judge's chamber and submitted a surrender petition signed by the suspects. While I was ex plaining the legality of the petition to the judge, the prosecutor entered the chamber and objected to the surrender.Later, the magistrate asked us to leave the chamber,“ said S Krishnakumar, counsel for the suspects.
 
 “When we were waiting outside, the cops tried to take him into custody . I protested and asked the cops to wait till the court order,“ said the advocate. The advocate then approached the court with a petition to produce them back at the court from where they were arrested.
 
 The additional chief judicial magistrate however refused the plea. “Petition and statement of the complainant, Adv S Krishnakumar, prima facie would show that the accused were removed from this court. Since no crime is pending before this court a direction to produce them back is unnecessary . But SHO central police station is directed to handover the accused to the investigating officer to produce before the court having jurisdiction in the case,“ the judgment reads.
