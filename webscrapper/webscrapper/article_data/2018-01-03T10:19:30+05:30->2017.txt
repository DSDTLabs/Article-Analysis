LUCKNOW: UP will conduct a survey to find out if there is a connection between wealth and sanitation. The survey will determine if economically well-off families construct and use toilets readily than those figuring low on the economic ladder.

 Given the ground realities of the drive to make cities, towns and villages in state Open Defecation Free (ODF), the survey was thought to have become a necessity.
 
 The six districts which have been declared ODF in the state, so far, lie in western UP. The districts include Shamli, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Bijnore, Gautam Budh Nagar and  .
 
 On the other hand, districts in the east like Allahabad, Ballia, Azamgarh etc. are lagging behind with the progress being very slow. While water scarcity may be a roadblock in   region, the survey will try to find out if economic condition of families is also a factor.
 
  department, the nodal department for Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), will hire an agency to conduct the survey in villages of districts lying in western, eastern, central and Bundelkhand regions.
 
 Till December 2017, UP has declared 16,785 villages as ODF with most of them lying in west UP districts. The Centre gives a grant of Rs 12,000 to construct a toilet.
 
 But many people in west UP have also got bathrooms constructed along with toilets by spending their own money. Few have got water tanks installed to make the facility even more convenient. “The ground realities have made us plan a survey to figure the connection between wealth and sanitation,” said state consultant, Swachh Bharat Mission, Sanjay  .
 
 The survey will also study the behaviour of beneficiaries and their requirements.
