KOLKATA: The   may be   for over a month for repair works and redesigning of the   stretch between the Chingrihata and Beliaghata crossings, police said. 

 DC (traffic) Solomon V Nesakumar said: “A trial shutdown was conducted from 10pm on Thursday to 6am on Friday to asses traffic congestion. The area witnessed major traffic snarls stretching up to Science City for over an hour on Friday morning. “Vehicles turning right at the Chingrihata crossing towards Nicco Park faced a hard time. We have asked the concerned civic authorities to make certain changes in the median divider. 
 
 Further, the KMDA has been asked to make alignments on the EM Bypass. Once these minor changes are made, we will decide on an official road block plan after discussing with all concerned agencies, including Bidhannagar Police,” said Solomon.
 
 If the flyover is blocked, buses from the Beliaghata connector loop might be diverted via the Bidhannagar commissionarate office.
