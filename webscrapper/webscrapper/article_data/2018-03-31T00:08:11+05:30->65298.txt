Bhopal: After solar power, Madhya Pradesh is actively considering to push use of concentrated solar thermal technology (CST) in industrial clusters in the state because of inherent advantages. In CST, mirrors are used to concentrate (focus) solar radiation and convert it into heat to create steam, which can be used in an industry.  A meeting with experts and representatives of the United Nations was held in the state on Friday to discuss promotion of concentrated solar thermal-based technologies. Sources said the state has already installed 1200 MW capacity of solar projects and further 1100 MW installation is in progress.  There are no accomplishments in the field of concentrated solar thermal technology (CST).  An expert’s delegation from Tokyo University, Japan, researchers from IIT Jodhpur, officials from United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and industry participants were present during the meeting held at the office of the new and renewable energy department, in Bhopal.  New and renewable energy principal secretary Manu Shrivastav chaired the meeting.  Sources said it was decided that industries operating in the five industrial clusters in the state —Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Gwalior and areas bordering Nagpur, shall be targeted for promotion of this technology. MPNRED, along with researchers in the field, will conduct workshops in these industrial clusters to educate industry practitioners on CST and its use in industrial processes. Industry associations such as CII, FICCI and Assocham, shall also be partnered for promotion of the technology. Industries where steam is a major input in industrial process can benefit from use of concentrated solar thermal based technologies. Textile, pulp and paper, food processing and chemical industries are some of industries where heated steam is used, said sources.
