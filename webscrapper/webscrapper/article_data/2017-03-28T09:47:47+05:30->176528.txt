KOLKATA: A joint movement by the CPM-led Left Front and other Left   against  's government seems unlikely as a Naxalite faction and another small Left party are yet to take a call on joining the May agitation.
 
  CPM leaders have urged all Left parties, including those which are not constituents of the Left Front, to join their movement, but a Naxalite faction, CPI ML (Liberation) and SUCI (Communist), are yet to respond to CPM's call.
  
  "It may not be possible to attend the May 22 agitation called by CPM's peasants’ wing as we will be busy observing 50 years of the Naxalbari movement.
  
  Most of our leaders would be busy from the second week of May preparing for the the Naxalbari event,” said  , state secretary of the CPI ML (Liberation).
  
  Another Left party, SUCI (Communist), is also undecided about joining CPM-sponsored agitation on May 22. The party, in the recent past, hadn’t joined any agitation sponsored by the CPIM as it had opposed CPM's decision to strike a poll alliance with the  .
  
  "Most probably, we are not joining the May 22 agitation," said a leader of the party. It is the SUCI (Communist) which had supported Mamata Banerjee during her Singur agitation.
  
  But later, the party had distanced itself from   opposing many of its policies, but the party is not comfortable yet to share a common platform with the CPIM to oppose the Mamata Banerjeeled government.
  
  For the past few years, the CPM is organising political agitations against Banerjee with support from 17 Left parties, including those which are partners of the opposition Left Front.
  
  Political organisations such as the Communist Party of Bharat and Bolshevik Party, whose presence are hardly felt, have been with the CPIM for the past few years. But not the Naxalite faction, CPI ML (LIberation), and SUCI (Communist).
