New Delhi: Two engineering students of Delhi Technological University (DTU) allegedly drowned in outer Delhiâ€™s Haiderpur canal on Thursday morning.

 Rescue operations are underway. However, their bodies could not be found till Thursday evening.
 
 Police said that the matter was reported when they received a PCR call at 6am, informing about two students drowning in the canal, soon after which PCR vans, Delhi Fire Service and NDRF teams rushed to the spot and they started the rescue operations.
 
 Police said that the victims were identified as Shekhar and Rajdeep, both 22 years old. They were final-year   students of DTU at Shahbad Daulatpur.
 
 Their friend, who witnessed the incident, told the cops that they were all sitting beside the canal when Shekhar slipped and Rajdeep jumped in to save him, but drowned as well.
 
 He said that they had got some paranthas packed from Murthal and had a plan to consume them near the canal. On their way back, they stopped near the canal and were eating the paranthas, when Shekhar got up to wash his hands and suddenly slipped.
 
 He said that they had all dipped their feet in the canal and this was not the first time they had gone there. He said that he waited for his friends to come out as he did not expect them to   since both of them knew how to swim.
 
 He kept calling out to them but when he got no response and the movement in the water also stopped, he informed the police about the incident from the spot. The local police began the rescue operation and divers and boats were called in. However, the two victims remained untraced till late evening.
