GURUGRAM: Buyers of flats in the   project in   have alleged the builder, having assured them on February 10 that handover will happen soon, missed the deadline of February 20. They have written a complaint to police commissioner   and marked it to the economic offences wing (EOW). 

 Having paid up 95% of the cost, the 700 homebuyers are yet to receive possession. While the builder has been blaming the government for delaying issuance of occupation certificates (OCs), authorities like DTCP said the issue is still being discussed. According to buyers, the town planner was not issuing OCs as work was incomplete, adding they had booked flats from 2011 on, and have paid up almost 95% of the due.
 
 “Avalon was supposed to deliver possession within 42 months from date of purchase — 2011 in my case,” said  , who lives in  . “The deadline expired on February 2016. We’ve been meeting them regularly ever since.”
 
 Buyers last met the builder’s representatives on February 10, when they were assured possession would be given in the next few days. But, growing weary of the endless wait, residents finally filed a complaint with the CP. “We also forwarded it to the EOW, which will act only on after the commissioner signs on the complaint,” said another resident.
 
 Assistant sub-inspector  , who residents said was their liaison officer, could not immediately comment on the matter. A spokesperson of the Avalon Group said the files were about to be cleared and should reach them in a few days. “The files are with the government in Chandigarh. Everything is complete on our end,” he said.
