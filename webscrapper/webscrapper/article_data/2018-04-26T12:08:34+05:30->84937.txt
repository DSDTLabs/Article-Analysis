THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Finance minister   said that government cannot provide compensation for the land that will be acquired for the   and that people should support the project by handing over land. 

 Addressing reporters after the   (KIIFB) board meeting, Isaac said that people should realize that the hill highway would bring rapid development in the area and hence they should support the project. He said the government is going ahead with both hill highway and coastal highway projects using   funds. Both highways will be a major tourist attraction with many modern facilities.
 
 For the coastal highway project, land acquisition will involve a huge portion of land owned by people. Hence adequate compensation will have to be given to people. Also, population density is high along the region selected for the coastal highway, said Isaac, adding that the project will have a 12m wide cycling track. KIIFB's executive committee sanctioned 68 projects worth Rs 2,041.13 crore. The minister said that bonds will be introduced soon to mobilize funds for KIIFB. Government has decided to seek the support of AXIS and   banks. The bonds will be introduced by June, he said.
