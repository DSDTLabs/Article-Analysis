CHENNAI: A week after TOI published photographs of about 30 Toyoto Altis   along with a report titled ’30 high-end sedans rust on high court campus’, the   administration has said it was to   to the government and to retain a few cars for ‘protocol and other important purposes’.

 Calling the TOI photographs as ‘false picture,’ a letter from V Devanathan, registrar (administration) of the high court said decision on surrender of cars was pending consideration and that they were ‘safely parked in the stilt area of the auditorium’. He, however, did not mention whether government’s permission has been obtained to retain the old cars.
 
 He said the working strength of judges of   at present was 54, as against the sanctioned strength of 75, and that “some of these vacancies are likely/expected to be filled in very shortly, and then some of these cars may have to be provided for such newly appointed judges.” He said TOI report that some cars are damaged ‘is totally false and misleading.’
 
 “The vehicles are being periodically cleaned, checked, water-washed and parked again after a thorough batter check,” the letter said: “The photographs published by you themselves make it clear that the dust coat found on the cars must be of recent accumulation.” It said the words ‘criminal negligence’ used in the report “are highly derogatory apart from not being accurate.”
