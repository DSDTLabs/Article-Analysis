LUCKNOW: Rajya Sabha MP   accused   (SP) patriarch   of treating him like a “political prostitute“. Once seen as a close aide of the SP founder, Amar said on Tuesday that he has no future with Mulayam.

 Asked about his equation with Mulayam by reporters, Amar said, “Netaji wanted me to enter his house from the back door, after dark, and leave before dawn, so that   and   could not see me.“
 
 Saying this was not how two respectable people met, Amar said, “Aise toh veshya ko bulaya jaata hai... Aise to veshya aati-jaati hain. Aur main rajnitik veshya nahin banna chahta (this is the way to call home prostitutes. Prostitutes visit homes like this.And I do not wish to become a political prostitute.“) Expelled from SP in 2016 by party president   for trying to topple him from CM's post, Amar said he was happy with where he is now.
 
 Accusing Mulayam of leaving him in the lurch during his troubles, Amar said the SP founder had twice ditched him: the first time when he was expelled in 2010, and the second time when he was told to leave the party just before the 2016 UP assembly elections.
