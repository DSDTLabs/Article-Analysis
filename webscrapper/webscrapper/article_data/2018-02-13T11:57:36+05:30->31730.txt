PATNA: With byelections to one   and two Assembly seats in the state round the corner, ticket aspirants from different political parties are leaving no stone unturned to convince their bosses.

 Three of RJD’s ticket aspirants were spotted outside the special CBI court in Ranchi, where party president Lalu Prasad appeared on Monday in a fodder scam case related to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 184 crore from Doranda treasury.
 
 Sources said two RJD netas – Girinath Singh and Sachidanand Singh Yadav – had gone to Ranchi to meet Lalu and seek ticket for Bhabhua Assembly seat. Former Jehanabad MLA Mundrika Singh Yadav’s son Suday Yadav was also present outside the court to seek ticket from Lalu.
 
 “There is nothing wrong in meeting party boss before elections,” RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav said. He added the RJD would finalise candidate for the Bhabhua seat only after holding talks with  , which is keen to contest the seat.
 
 As far as Jehanabad seat is concerned, RJD sources said the party would offer ticket to Mundrika’s wife if his two sons – Uday Yadav and Suday Yadav – fail to resolve dispute.
 
 In BJP, former Bhabhua MLA   Pandey’s wife Rinki Rani Pandey has thrown her hat into the ring. She claimed the party has chosen her for the seat as she is wife of the deceased MLA. BJP state vice-president Devesh Kumar, however, said Rinki was just one of the contenders. “The final decision will be taken by the central leadership,” he added.
 
 “BJP state president Nityanand Rai, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and   will finalise names of three or four candidates for each seat and send them to the central leadership of the party for final nod,” Devesh said.
