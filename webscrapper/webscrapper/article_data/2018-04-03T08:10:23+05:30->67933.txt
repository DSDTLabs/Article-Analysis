Gold Coast: The allegation against the Indian athletes following the recovery of syringes from their accommodation has been escalated to the Commonwealth Games   for breaching the ‘no-needle policy’.

 
 
 
 
 
 “The CGF Medical Commission has concluded its investigation into an alleged violation of the CGF’s No   Policy. Their findings have been escalated to the CGF’s Federation Court which will conduct a hearing into the matter. The hearing will take place tomorrow morning (Tuesday) at 10 am and the decision will be communicated after the hearing,” the CGF said in a press release. Any possible sanctions will be decided following the hearing.
 
 
 
 
 
 “There has been a clear breach to the no-needle policy and a CGA (Commonwealth Games association) has been summoned to meet with the medical commission as part of our investigation,” Games chief David Grevemberg told reporters. “These needles have been brought in and there was no approval for them to be there,” he added.
 
 The matter is not defined as an anti-doping rule violation, but rather as an infringement to the CGF’s no-needle policy, which has been introduced at major events.
 
 According to reports in the local media, there were conflicting details over what exactly happened, with the CGF declining to reveal the exact nature of the incident until the ederation Court process has been concluded.
 
 The no needle rules state that they can be used by “medically qualified practitioners for the clinically justified treatment of injury, illness or other medical conditions”.
