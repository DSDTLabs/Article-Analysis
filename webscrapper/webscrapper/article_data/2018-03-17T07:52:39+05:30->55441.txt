NEW DELHI: In a first, the   is set to work out the venues for India’s home games for the 2018-19 season even before the   has begun. The BCCI’s tours and fixtures committee is set to meet on Saturday to finalise the venues.

 
 
 
 “There have been a lot of logistical hassles in the past, with venues being finalised mere weeks before the match date. State associations need time to work out their own programmes,” a top BCCI official told TOI on Friday.
 
 The move aims to make it convenient for spectators to purchase tickets well in advance, as is done in countries like Australia and  .
 
 
 
 “It used to be embarrassing to see people scurrying for tickets a few days before a match. In England, people can plan to watch a match months ahead of the game. It should be the same in India too,” the official said. “Issues like Delhi fighting pollution during October-November need to be addressed. It’s likely Delhi will host an ODI against Australia in February-March rather than a game against West Indies earlier in the season.”
 
 National selectors too have been invited to the conclave in order to ease out the planning of domestic fixtures and India A matches.
 
 “Last year a lot of India A matches and Ranji Trophy matches overlapped. Some players had to opt out of domestic matches to be fit for international matches. If regular India players can travel with the A team to England before the actual series starts, they can get adequate match practice,” the official added.
 
 The tricky issue of hosting a day-night Test will also be up for discussion. Last year, the Duleep Trophy - a platform to try out the pink ball - had to be accommodated after being initially scrapped. Planning the tournament in advance will give the board time to analyse feedback. India play just two Tests against West Indies next season.
