RAJKOT/SURAT: Low-cost airlines operator SpiceJet on Monday began its daily Mumbai flights from   and Porbandar under the Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik ( ) scheme of the union government. The company also launched a direct flight each to Hyderabad and Mumbai from Surat.

 “The direct flight to Mumbai was much-needed in the eastern and southern region of Kutch which has an industrial investment of Rs 70,000 crore. As there were only three flights from Bhuj, we were forced to pay exorbitant ticket prices that went up to Rs 24,000 sometimets,” said Nimish Phadke, managing director, FOKIA.
