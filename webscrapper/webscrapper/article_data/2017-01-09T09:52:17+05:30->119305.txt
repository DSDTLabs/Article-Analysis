NAGPUR: The irreplaceable magic of RD Burman and Kishore Kumar had the audience asking for more again and again at the Diamonds Forever show which had the duo’s songs as the theme. 

 At Scientific Society hall on Sunday, once again the evergreen hits like rim jhim giray sawan, kis maud pe jaatey hain and tum aagaye ho were the winners as city singers  , Sagar  , Shreya Kharabe and Neha rendered the best of Pancham and Kishore.
 
 Presented by Siddhivinayak Publicity, the show was the first in the series of musical concerts to be presented through the year. Starting with songs from the films of hit trio of Rajesh Khanna, R.D. Burman and Kishore Kumar, the concert began with pyar deewana hota hai, O meray dil ke chain and had Sagar give a soulful presentation of chingari koi bhadkey. Each of the total 21 songs compiled for the evening once again spoke of the popularity of these hits of seventies. Shreya gave good support in duets like hum dono do premi, ek main aur ek tu and jaan e jaan. The other female singer Neha showed promise with songs like kis maud se jaatey hain and Kanchi re kanchi re. Sarang Joshi had the audience on their feet with Burman’s hit dhanno ki ankhon main pyar ka surma and dil lend khel hai dildaar ka and was equally good with the sombre musafir hoon yaaro and pyar deewana hota hai.
 
 Familiar with the format the audience had a good time as Madhumatke typically hopped offstage mingled with the audience and also brought a little girl on stage to do an impromptu jig. Enjoying the show equally was anchor   who chided the crowds for their repeated demands of once more and after making the introductions of the musicians sportingly asked the crowd “into mere naam batadijiye” when someone asked for her introduction.
