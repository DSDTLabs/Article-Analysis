KOLKATA: The   Kolkata Development Authority ( ) has decided to bring all compactors and mechanical road sweeping machines under the GPS-enabled Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) to develop a performance-oriented  .

 According to the technology, the location of the machines is time-logged on to a map and a software generates the distances travelled. The effectiveness of a machine, be it a compactor or a sweeping machine, is thus tracked accurately in real time from the engineer’s office.
 
  had in June last year suggested installation of the VTS system to keep a constant watch on the waste management system. “Through VTS, the authorities will be able to monitor and track how long and where the road sweeping machines are working. The authorities will be able to track down and take steps against workers engaged in waste management if it is found that the machines have not been used to its full,” said an official.
 
 “There is no specific duty hours. The road sweeping process goes on from the morning till afternoon. However, each road stretch in New Town needs to be swept at least once a day,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. 
 
 At present, there are two road-sweeping machines and another two will be introduced soon. 
 
 Currently, about 36,000 people reside in New Town and another 80,000 commuters enter the township daily for work and other purposes. The daily solid waste generation is about 40 tonne and it would increase with more residential complexes and commercial establishments coming up.
 
 An agency collects wastes from households but mechanical sweeping machines collect waste generated on the major arterial road. However, manual sweepers have been deployed for other roads.
