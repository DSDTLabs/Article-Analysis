NOIDA: The market association in Noida’s Sector 18 has decided to move the   against “high rates” at the multi-level parking maintained by DLF. 

 The Sector 18 association joined members of the   and demanded that a committee be formed to look into difference in rates for parking vehicles at the DLF multi-level parking and inside the mall. The association has also demanded that monthly parking rates should not exceed Rs 400 for four-wheelers and Rs 150 for two wheelers.
 
 “There is huge difference in the parking charge inside the mall and that at the multi-level parking. While DLF charges Rs 40 a day on weekdays, on weekends, it is Rs 60. This is much lower than the multi-level parking charges of over Rs 100 for day-long parking. Further, the surface parking charges have shot up to Rs 20 an hour from Rs 10 an hour earlier,” said Sushil Jain, the president of Sector 18 market association.
 
 Dev Baisoya, head (operations)   of India, said the group was charging what the Noida Authority had asked them to. “We have a standard structure for charges for both the mall and the multi-level parking,” he said.
