MUMBAI: Four persons were arrested after being trapped by police and animal activists while transporting a sedated adult bullock that had been crammed into the tiny space at the back of an SUV in Kalyan on Monday .

 People for Animals (PFA) activists and the Bazarpeth police said the animal was probably snatched and was being illegally transported for slaughter in  . One accused, Israr Ansari, 30, fled.
 
 Ansari and the arrested Mohsin Khan, 30, Quaiz Don, 26, Salman Shaikh, 26, and  , 30, have been booked under IPC section 379 (theft), the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, 2015, and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.
 
 “It was shocking to see the condition of the animal which had been literally pack ed into the back of the car,“ said Chetan Sharma of PFA.
 
 The bullock was unconscious as it had been injected with a sleep-inducing drug before being crammed into the black Scorpio. “There have been several instances in the past when free-roaming cattle, cows and buffalos in villages and cities have been abducted after making them unconscious with an injection. What surprised us is that instead of using a tempo or a truck, a smaller vehicle like an SUV was being used to transport it for the illegal slaughter,“ Sharma added.
 
 The rescued bullock has been sent to a cattle shelter and efforts are on to trace the original owner of the animal.
 
 This May , TOI had reported how a Neral farmer,   (55), lost a foot while trying to stop cattle thieves in his village in   taluka.The thieves had injected a drug into some cattle late at night and were trying to them in a tempo. When Satvi approached them, the thieves panicked and drove the vehicle over his leg.
