NEW DELHI: Over a dozen Dalit law makers including Union ministers and MPs will meet Prime Minister   on Wednesday to apprise him of issues concerning the SCs and STs including the unhappiness among the community over the recent   order on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and seeking reservation in private sector jobs. 

  NDA's allies including   and   (A) have urged the government to file a review petition in the apex court and the LJP has already filed one. 
 
  The proposal of a team of Dalit MPs seeking time from the Prime Minister for a meeting was decided on March 15 when 29 law makers had met at LJP chief  's residence. The law makers had adopted to urge the government for reservation in promotion to SCs/STs. They also want enactment of a law for reservation in government jobs for SCs and STs, which is implemented through government orders. 
 
  "The persons belonging to SCs/ STs have been deprived of the benefit of reservation by the orders of different courts from time to time. Today, it is the need of the hour that the law related to reservation for SCs/ STs be passed in the Parliament and implemented accordingly," they had adopted.
