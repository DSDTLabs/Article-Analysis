Vijayawada: Minister for health   Srinivas Rao has said that there is no possibility of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) having an electoral alliance with the YSR Congress ( ) in the state in the next elections.

 Interacting with mediapersons at Mangalagiri in Guntur district on Wednesday, the minister asserted that the alliance between BJP and TDP would continue in the next elections. The disturbances over funding the state by the central government would be settled soon. He said that both BJP and TDP leaders were concerned more about development of the state and the statements from both the parties project the commitment of the two parties.
 
 Stating that BJP is a non-corrupt and honest party, he wondered how the party would have electoral alliance with YSRC whose chief was in jail for 16 months and still have cases pending against him. “Jagan Mohan Reddy is a symbol of corruption and it is not known to every citizen. BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are clean and corruption-free. How can they go for alliance with Jagan who is notorious for corruption?” he asked.
 
 Srinivas said the BJP leadership and the Prime Minister are committed to the development of the state. The central government is funding every institute including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Mangalagiri. As all the institutions are in the construction stage, the central government is releasing funds as per the requirement, he added.
