AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has directed the   commissioner to take a decision whether an FIR should be lodged against   officer S K Gadhvi for insulting and beating a police-sub inspector at the city airport during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on September 16 last year.

 The incident had attracted attention because the PSI had allegedly slapped the IPS officer in retaliation. In response to a petition by PSI Paresh Chaudhary for direction to register an FIR against the IPS officer, the HC asked the police commissioner to look into his complaint against his senior officer. The HC directed the commissioner to order an FIR against the IPS officer, if he finds any cognizable offence in the PSI’s complaint. Alternatively, the commissioner has been asked to explain in writing to the PSI why the FIR cannot be registered. In such case, Chaudhary could approach the magisterial court. tnn
