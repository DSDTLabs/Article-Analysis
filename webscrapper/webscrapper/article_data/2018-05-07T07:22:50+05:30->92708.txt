Ahmedabad: The   in Gujarat have planned to install sensors in two central jails that will alert officials about any underground movement and thwart bids by prisoners to escape by  .

 The move comes five years after some prisoners dug up a tunnel in the British-era Sabarmati  .
 
  “To foil attempts by inmates to escape by digging a tunnel, we have decided to install the systems in the Sabarmati central jail and the Lajpore central jail in Surat district,” said additional director general of police, prisons, T S Bisht. “Gujarat is probably the first state in the country that is planning to install such systems in jails.” He said that only the Border Security Force (BSF) uses the system to detect tunnels near border areas.
 
 The state government has allocated Rs 2.8 crore for the implementation of the project in these two jails, Bisht said. As a part of the system, several sensors will be installed about three metres under the ground at regular intervals inside the jail, Bisht said. “The sensors are capable of detecting underground vibrations and movements three metres up and down from the point of installation. Thus, they will cover a radius of six metres,” he said. The sensors will transmit real-time signals on detecting any underground movement or vibrations due to digging, he said.
 
 “The web of sensors will be connected to a control room and an alarm,” he said. “Apart from activating the alarm on detecting vibrations, the system will also send an SMS to the designated numbers of jail officials,” Bisht said. The system is expected to be first implemented near the high security area of the Sabarmati jail by the end of this year, he said. pti
