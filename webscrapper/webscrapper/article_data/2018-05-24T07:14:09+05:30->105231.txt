MAPUSA: Anjuna police on Wednesday arrested two Russian nationals for running a prostitution   in Goa, and rescued two women. 

 Police inspector Chetan Patil said that the police received a reliable tip-off that ‘some foreigners’ are running a   racket at a posh residential complex at Marna, Siolim. Police then laid a trap, sending a decoy customer and paying the advance. When the pimp arrived in Anjuna with the woman, he was apprehended. During interrogation, he told police that he and an accomplice ran the sex racket from the Siolim apartment, which they had rented. 
 
 Anjuna police then raided the apartment and arrested his accomplice.
 
 The pimps were identified as Vasily Karavaev, 44, and Konstantin Aleksandrovich Morozli, 36. Police also rescued two women, both Russians.
 
 Police sources told TOI that the duo had been running the racket over the past one month. The accused Russians used to contact potential customers over phone or internet under the guise of selling books on the beach. The women in the racket were mostly Russians and Ukrainians. Police said the pimps used to receive an advance, and then, after a few hours, provide the women. The rented apartment was also made available to customers. 
 
 Anjuna police booked the two under relevant sections of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, and are further investigating.
