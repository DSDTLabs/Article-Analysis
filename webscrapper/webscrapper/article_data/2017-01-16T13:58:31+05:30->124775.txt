It was a new experience for actor   when he was invited to be part of vijay starrer Bairavaa. Vijay is quite a soft-spoken actor, with no starry airs, he says. "Vijay speaks very little on the set. Even when he says something, he whispers it to the director's ear, and speaks softly. He was very patient throughout the takes."
However, Vijayaraghavan found the atmosphere on the set a bit stifling. "In Malayalam, people gather around and talk during breaks. But everyone gets into their caravans there. I felt it a little suffocating."
