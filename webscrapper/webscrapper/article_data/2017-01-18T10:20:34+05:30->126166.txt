 “Shamshad, I will soon be shooting in Jodhpur. Will see to it that we meet there,“ tweeted Devgan from his twitter handle on Tuesday .
 
 Shamshad had last week asked his parents and Nawalagarh district administration to set up a meeting between him and the actor. He threatened to end his life by jumping into a well if his demands were not met. Later, a villager impersonated the actor and spoke to him over the phone and invited him to come to Mumbai.
 
 On Monday , when the actor learned about the incident he contacted Jaipur police via their twitter handle @Jaipur_Police to enquire about his fan.
 
 “The actor's team had tweeted on Jaipur police's twitter handle seeking information about Shamshad. We provided them with the numbers of Jhunjhunu police control room,“ said a senior police officer.
 
 He added that later several other fans of the actor too tweeted Jaipur police about the whereabouts of Shams had. Last week, Shasmshad made the threat while standing precariously on the edge of a stone step inside the well while holding on to a rope.
 
 When Nawalgarh police station house officer (SHO) Nawal Kishore Meena and other officials reached the spot, Shamshad asked them to set up a meeting with the actor in Mumbai even as he threatened to let go of the rope.
 
 One of the villagers impersonated as the actor and promised to meet Shasmshad after which he came out of the well. The cops took Shamshad to police station where they found that his mental condition required psychiatric care.
