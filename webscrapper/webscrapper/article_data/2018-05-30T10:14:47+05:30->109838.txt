JERUSELAM: Israel's military said on wednesday it had struck 25 more   "military targets" in air raids in the   overnight in response to rocket and mortar fire, part of the worst military flare-up since a 2014 war.

 
 Israel had said on tuesday it hit more than 35 militant targets in the Palestinian enclave after a barrage of rocket and mortar fire from Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip, and Islamic Jihad.
 
 It said late tuesday about 70 rockets and mortars had been fired at Israel throughout the day. A number of them were inter-cepted by air defence systems.
