HYDERABAD: A day after the brutal rape of a 35-year-old woman at   (OGH), Telangana Junior  ' Association has blamed authorities for the incident, stating security outposts are never manned and guards never seen at their designated posts. 

 Worse, the   had recently changed the security agency, but most guards turned out to be old ones in new uniforms. Hospital authorities themselves admit that 70% of the guards continue to be the same and have been there for years together, despite changing the security agency. 
 
 After the incident, a decision was taken to shift over 50% of the existing security personnel, hospital authorities said. 
 
 Health minister C Laxma Reddy has directed OGH authorities to move out security guards not working properly. "We have directed OGH to identify guards who have been posted there for a long time and shift them out. We have also asked for terminating some. A list will be drawn up soon and action will be taken," said the minister, adding that additional police personnel would be deployed there.
 
 The fact remains that most guards have been at the facility for too long and had become lazy. "The security agencies have a rule that they have to keep the existing staff. Also, the fact that they are known to the staff makes it difficult for the agency to take action on them," Osmania Hospital superintendent Dr B Nagender said.
 
 "Since the agency is handling security at all government hospitals, we have asked them to shift over 50% of guards to some other location. We plan to change all guards who have been at OGH for over five years," he added. "Although the security agency was changed, the guards remains the same. Every time an incident happens and doctors call security guards, they are not available," Dr S Anand, advisor Telangana State Junior Doctors' Association (TJUDA) and a resident at the OGH campus, said.
