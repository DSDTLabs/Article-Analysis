AGRA: Secretary of  's   Shahzad Alam Burni has written a letter to the   demanding “detention” of BJP leaders, including Unnao MP, Sakshi Maharaj, for making provocative religious statements.

 The complaint is a direct fallout of Shakshi Maharaj's controversial statement blaming Muslims for population explosion in the country. The MP has already been booked by the Meerut police for his remarks.
 
 In his letter to the election commission, Burni stated that few BJP leaders were trying to provoke religious sentiments, with an intent to create tensions between communities to polarize voters ahead of the crucial UP elections. He said in order to prevent such ugly situations from developing, it's necessary to detain leaders like Sakshi Maharaj, Sadhvi Prachi, Sadhvi Niranjan, Yogi Adityanath and Sangeet Som.
 
 Talking to TOI, Burni said these five leaders are also well known for making provocative communal remarks. He said though the BJP claims that they don’t ask for votes in the name of religion, the truth is that its leaders always attempt to evoke religious sentiments of the voters by their rabid speeches. He said the recent statement against Muslims by Sakshi Maharaj is just another examples.
 
 He said by making such statement they are just not violating the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) but are voilating the prevailing communal harmony in the state.
 
 He said, ironically Shakshi Maharaj'a comments were made just four days after the Supreme Court ruled that political parties and candidates can’t seek votes in the name of religion or caste.
