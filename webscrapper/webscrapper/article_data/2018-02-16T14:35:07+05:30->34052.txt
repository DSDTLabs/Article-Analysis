MYSURU: Senior BJP leader and former Karnataka home minister R Ashok on Thursday said that Prime Minister   would give a fitting reply to chief minister   on his home turf. Ashok, who reviewed preparations for Modi’s rally in the city scheduled on Monday, said that the diary of Congress MLA Govindaraju was enough evidence to show that the Congress had looted money.

 In the wake of Modi’s statements on the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government being a ‘10% commission government’, the CM had asked the PM to back his allegations.
 
 Ashok added, “There is a lot of corruption in the Indira Canteen scheme, and other developmental projects including road development ones.”
 
 Ahead of the assembly elections, the BJP is organising five massive rallies across the state starting in   on Monday. Modi will arrive in the city on Sunday. The rally is expected to be attended by party workers from Msyuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and Kodagu. “We are expecting one lakh people at the rally,” he said.
 
 Besides Modi, BJP Karnataka in-charge and Union railway minister Piyush Goyal, central ministers Ananth Kumar and DV Sadananda Gowda, along with BJP Karnataka president BS Yeddyurappa will be in attendance at the rally.
 
 “Tickets will be given only to those candidates who are potential winners. A list of 120 candidates has already been prepared, and the rest of the candidates will be decided after a survey. A private firm is helping us in the survey to understand the popularity of candidates in their constituencies,” Ashok added.
