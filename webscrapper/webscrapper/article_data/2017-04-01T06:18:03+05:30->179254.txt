New Delhi: The trend that Aam Aadmi Party started in 2013 of nominating members of residents’ welfare associations as election candidates will be strengthened in the coming municipal elections, with   and   choosing many civil society members as contestants. This has forced political parties like   to also review their candidate selection strategies.

 “Traditional political parties never considered civil society members as ‘winnable’ candidates, only as a vote bank,” said Anupam, spokesperson of Swaraj India. “We have changed the discourse and given RWA members and social activists an opportunity to contest because no one knows about the problems in their localities better than they do.”
 
 In the 2013 and 2015 assembly polls, AAP first gave tickets to non-politicians, of whom Anil Bajpai, member of East Delhi RWA Federation, and Naresh Yadav, senior member of Vasant Kunj RWA, returned victorious. “This year, we have people associated with RWAs contesting in Rohini, Vasant Kunj, Dwarka and Lajpat Nagar,” said Ashish Talwar, party in-charge, Delhi. 
 
 With delimitation changing the electoral patterns in many wards and with new parties entering the fray, the traditional parties too have been left contemplating deploying civil society members in a bid to connect better with the masses. While Congress leaders concede the possibility of this section fighting under the hand symbol, BJP MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, head of the party’s election management committee for the polls, said, “Many of our workers are engaged in social activities like civil society members are. Our main criterion is winnability, and we will consider the applications of those who have been associated with our party.”
 
    chief Manoj Tiwari has formed a committee to engage with civil society members. “We will be organising meeting with RWAs,” said Pankaj Wadhawan, convenor of RWA Cell, Delhi BJP.
