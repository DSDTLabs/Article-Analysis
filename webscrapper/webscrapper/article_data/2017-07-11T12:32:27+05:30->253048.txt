PUNE: A man allegedly killed his wife and 13-year-old   and assaulted his daughter and a neighbour with a sharp weapon in the wee hours of Monday at Kanhe Phata on Pune-Mumbai highway.

 Police said the man,   (39), suspected his wife, Rajani (38), of infidelity and this might have driven him to commit the gruesome act. His deceased son was identified as Anush.
 
 Satkar walked into the Wadgaon Maval police station to surrender. He even narrated to the police how he committed the crime.
 
 Satkar is a labour class employee with the manufacturing plant of a prominent automobile company in MIDC Talegaon Dadadhe.
 
 Satkar’s daughter, Shubhra alias Shravani (9), and neighbour, Ganesh Ambekar, who had rushed to their house on hearing screams of the victims, suffered serious injuries. 
 
 Both, Shubhra and Ganesh, were admitted to a private hospital. They are undergoing treatment for injuries to hand and stomach. Rajani and Anush died of grievous stab wounds to neck, the police said.
 
 Before Satkar could reach the police station, his brother brother-in-law, Ganesh Nana Maukar of Lonavla, had informed the police about the incident. The police said the alleged crime occurred within 15 minutes, from 1am. Rajani and her kids were fast asleep in their modest house at Kanhe Phata then.
 
 As Satkar started assaulting his wife and kids, the children started screaming aloud drawing the attention of Ambekar, their neighbour. The latter woke up and rushed to Satkar’s house sensing something wrong. Satkar assaulted him too in the stomach in a fit of rage.
 
 The police said Satkar told investigators that he suspected his wife of having an affair with another man residing in the same locality and that she would meet him regularly. The family having roots in Kanhe village has been staying at Kanhe Phata in Wadagaon Maval.
