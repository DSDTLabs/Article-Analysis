The first medicine outlet for generic medicines in   zone is likely to be opened at   and Hospital (JLNMCH). Medicines for the treatment of cancer, kidney, heart and other ailments would also be made available at these outlets.
  
  JLNMCH medical superintendent Dr RC Mandal said the generic medicine outlets would cater to the needs of poor patients as well as the well-off. “Generic medicines are almost half the price or even less than the branded medicines,” he said, adding, “Efficacy of the generic medicines cannot be doubted as it too has equivalent chemical composition and are produced by big pharmaceutical companies. Anyone doubting the efficacy of generic medicine is like harming the welfare-centric spirit behind it,” he added.
  
  According to the directives issued by   ministry of health and family welfare, every physician (practicing doctor) should prescribe drugs (medicines) with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters and he/she should ensure that there is a rational prescription for use of the drug. The directive also requests all the states and union territories across the nation to ensure strict compliance of the provisions.
