LUDHIANA: Mayor Balkar Sandhu and   commissioner   conducted a meeting on Friday to streamline the system of the building branch and curb corrupt practice among staff. Officials have been told to catch hold of people who do not get approval for their building plans. If any illegal construction is found in the city, the building inspector concerned will have to pay the price.

 On Friday, two officials were served show cause notices for not collecting the challan amount from defaulters in Zone C. Assistant town planner (ATP) headquarters SS   said they had issued a show cause notice to   and building inspector Kirandeep to explain the reasons why they did not take action against   in Zone C. He said even though the ATP had been transferred to another zone, he would still have to give the reasons.
 
  minister Navjot   had clearly ordered the commissioner to recommend dismissal of erring officials if they did not pay attention to their responsibilities. In order to convey the minister’s message, a meeting was conducted in Zone D. The MC commissioner said they had passed on the instructions given by the minister, and the field staff had been asked to keep a regular check on new constructions.
 
 The mayor asked officials to bring recoveries from defaulters at any cost. He condemned the building branch for their failure in keeping a check on mushrooming illegal structures and poor recovery. He quoted Sidhu and said: “From Ludhiana, only 1,500 to 1,600 building plans were getting approved, whereas in MCs like  , the number is far better.” However, officials rued they cannot remain in the field all day due to excess work and staff shortage.
 
 The mayor has asked officials from the property tax branch to first recover pending dues from big defaulters. Meanwhile, two LED screens have reached the building branch, where complaints would be displayed throughout the day. Redressal of complaints will be made compulsory for staff.
