  :   at   of   (SVNIRTAR) will get a major boost as the institute will get   soon. 

 Union minister for social justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot will lay the foundation stone of the project on January 23 on the institute premises. The new building will come up at a cost of Rs 15.89 crore provided by the Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (RECL) as part of its CSR programme. 
 
 SVNIRTAR, established for treatment and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities in 1975, currently has only 100 beds but it remains overcrowded round the year. In the last four decades, the inflow of patients has increased manifold in the institute but accordingly infrastructure upgradation has not taken place.
 
 The expansion and addition of 100 beds at the autonomous institute run by the central government, at Olatpur in Cuttack district, will immensely benefit thousands of patients.
 
 Director of the institute Dr S P Das said the new building will be developed into a centre of excellence for deformity correction in disabled people. "We have plans to complete the project within 18 months. Additional manpower will also be recruited to handle the new unit," said Dr Das.
