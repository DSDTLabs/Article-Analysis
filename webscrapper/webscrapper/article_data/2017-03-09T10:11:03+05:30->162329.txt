JAIPUR: Chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced benefits for students from the economically backward classes (EBC) on Wednesday.

 The announcements made in budget 2017-18 for people from the non-reserved categories—purportedly to pacify the recent clamoring over quota for economically backward—were similar to those announced by previous Congress government in the budget of 2012-13.
 
 Making the announcements, chief minister Raje said top 100 girls who score more than 90% marks in RBSE’s Class X exam and top 100 girls who score more than 90% marks in Science, Arts and Commerce streams (300 girls in all) of RBSE’s Class XII exam will be given Scooty (a brand of scooters designed for women). Students whose schools or colleges are located more than 2-km from the government hostel they reside in, will get cycles for commuting to their education institutions. Specially-abled students of orthopedic category will get tricycles to school/college.
 
 The Sarva Brahmin Mahasabha, however, said similar benefits for the general category students existed under the previous government too. “Earlier, there were scholarships for meritorious students from general category. This budget does not talk of scholarships. It seems the scholarship amount will now be spent on Scooty, cycles and tricycles,” said Suresh Mishra, president of the Mahasabha that has been fighting for EBC quota in government jobs and education institutes.
 
 Mishra added, “Our demand was for an EBC Board with a budgetary allocation of Rs 1000-cr, like the Dev Narayan Board existing for the Specially Backward Classes (SBC) people. The EBC Board should have decided how to spend the budget money for non-reserved category students.”
