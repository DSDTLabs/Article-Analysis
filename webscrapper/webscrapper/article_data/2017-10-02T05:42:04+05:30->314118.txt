NEW DELHI:   (R-Infra) has received interest from at least four players for its Mumbai power business, comprising generation, transmission and distribution with estimates suggesting that the sale will help the   group repay around 70% of the Rs 20,000-crore debt with the company.

 R-Infra intends to focus on defence and EPC business after exiting what was once a prime business with road projects -also proposed to be monetised. Given the high debt levels, the focus is on businesses that require less capital and the sale is targeted to clear around 14,000 crore of loans on the company's books.
 
 Sources said that Hyderabad-based Greenko, CLP of Hong Kong,   and Enel of Italy had evinced interest in the assets that are now on the block. Tata Power, however, denied it. In a statement, Tata Power said, “We are not aware of anyone from Tata power having been approached.“ The others could not be reached for comment.
 
 When contacted, an R-Infra spokesperson said, “As Reliance Group chairman   announced at the recent AGM of the company , `We continue to explore and examine various opportunities for the asset monetisation of Reliance Infrastructure and unlocking shareholder value, which is part of the ongoing transformation strategy at Reliance Group.'“ R-Infra's Mumbai generation assets included a 500MW facility, which was commissioned in 1995 with the trans mission sy stem having a capacity 3,000MVA.
 
 of The distribution business covers around three million households with annual revenues of around Rs 7,500 crore and ebitda of Rs 1,500 crore.
 
 The company has been trying to sell the power business in Mumbai for close to two years, having signed a non-binding agreement with Public Sector   Investment Board of Canada to explore the sale of 49% stake. But the November 2015 pact lapsed.
