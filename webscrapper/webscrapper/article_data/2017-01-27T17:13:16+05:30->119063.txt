After the hits Ordinary and Madhura Naranga, the team of  , director   and scriptwriter Nishad Koya will reunite for an upcoming movie, which is all set to go on floors by mid-March.

 Nishad, who had recently scripted Mammootty's Thoppil Joppan, tells us, 'The movie will be an entertainer, which gives a lot of prominence to humour. However, it will also have a few action sequences.'
 The upcoming film will also see a break to the Kunchacko-Biju Menon combination in Sugeeth's movies as the director has cast Vinayakan as the second lead. 'He will have a meaty role along with Kunchacko Boban in the movie,' says Nishad, who along with the director is currently in Dubai working on the script.
 
 On the plot, he says, 'It's about a young man who comes to Kochi from his village. We don't want to let out the other details as we are still in the process of developing the story.'
 The rest of the cast of the film is yet to be finalised. The movie is expected to go on floors by mid-March. Meanwhile, Kunchacko Boban, whose next release will be Mahesh Narayanan's Take Off, has also signed Ranjith Sankar's upcoming film Ramante Edenthottam, in which he would be playing the eponymous hero.
