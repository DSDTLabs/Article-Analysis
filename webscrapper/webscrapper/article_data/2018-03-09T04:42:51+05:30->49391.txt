MUMBAI: A woman travelling illegally in a compartment reserved for the disabled was booked under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act by the GRP on Thursday.

 This is the first time that a woman has been booked under this stringent Act. An activist, Fatima D’Souza, pressed charges and also shot a clip of her argument with the woman. “I had boarded the 10.58am Churchgate-bound local from   station on Thursday. An able-bodied woman boarded the compartment at  . I asked her if she knew that the compartment was reserved for the disabled. She said she was aware and had got in as there was no space in the ladies coach. She also started arguing with me,” said D’Souza.
 
 D’Souza then dialled the GRP helpline.
