HYDERABAD: Uncertain as to when the   (TSBIE) will make its stand clear on residential intermediate   hostel affiliation guidelines, many students have taken admission, paying lakhs to colleges, especially corporate ones. Students were left with no option as classes in these colleges had already begun. 

 
 "We waited for more than two months to get some clarity. In the end, I was forced to join my child in a corporate residential college without knowing if they would get affiliation," said Rakesh D, a parent.
 
 College authorities say they have no clarity on the issue. "After the board released the hostel affiliation notification, we asked for relaxations on some guidelines, especially with the caution deposit amount, as small colleges are in no position to afford the prescribed amount. We are yet to hear from the board," said  , honorary president,   Association, adding that corporate colleges filed a case at the high court, opposing guidelines issued by the board. 
 
 Officials from Intermediate departments, however, asked parents to wait a little longer before enrolling their wards in residential colleges, as a decision would be made soon. 
 
 "As of now, it would be better if parents don't enrol their children in residential colleges as it is still not clear whether a college will be able to get hostel affiliation or not. In fact, some corporate colleges did not even get affiliation to run non-residential colleges as they are yet to get all the required permissions from the government," said Venkya Nayak, district intermediate education officer (DIEO),  .
 
 So far, only 13 colleges in the state have applied for hostel affiliation, of which none are from Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, and   districts.
