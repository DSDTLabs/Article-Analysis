LUCKNOW: The Opposition has demanded such stringent action against those guilty of vandalising Dr   in Siddharthnagar and Allahabad that it acts as a deterrent in future.

 
 BSP supremo Mayawati accused BJP of playing petty politics over Ambedkar but failing to protect his followers. “Instead of calling Ambedkar by his better known name and changing it to ‘Ramji Ambedkar’ for political gains, the Yogi government should take such severe action against those guilty of vandalising statues that no one dares to commit the act again. Government’s failure in taking strict action in earlier incidents is bringing it a bad name now. This situation will not be resolved by government putting up a new statue. It has to use laws strictly to prevent more such incidents,” she said.
 
 
 Demanding the arrest of those guilty of killing a Dalit boy  , in  , Bhavnagar, Gujarat, Mayawati said that BJP has failed to stop caste violence. “In Gujarat, a Dalit was killed for riding a horse. In fact, prima facie, the government seems to be shielding the accused in the case. By failing to make a single arrest in Rathod’s murder, the Gujarat government has shown its insensitive attitude towards Dalits and backwards,” she said.
 
 
 Appealing people to maintain peace, Mayawati said that incidents like   in Una were sufficient to embarrass BJP leadership but the silence of PM Modi and other seniors was no longer surprising. “They are not affected by the persecution of  . Their interest lies not in the country but in vote-bank politics,” Mayawati said.
 
 
 Targeting ruling BJP, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said attacks on Dalits and underprivileged have increased under the present regime. “A dalit youth was murdered in Gujarat because he was riding a horse and now Ambedkar statues are being vandalised — all this is a design to terrorise Dalits,” he said on Saturday.
