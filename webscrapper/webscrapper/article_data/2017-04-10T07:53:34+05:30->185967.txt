HYDERABAD: A treat for   is on the cards, as two-day theatre fest will be held every month in the city by performers across the country. 

 'Theatre Weekends' organised by   along with Karvy have come up with the fest, that promises to delight the city. 
 
 The first edition of 'Theatre Weekend' has two plays in store. Mohammad Ali Baig's internationally-acclaimed '1857: Turrebaz Khan' will be presented on April 14 followed by Bollywood actor Zeeshan Ayyub's 'Iss   ka Kya Karen?' on April 15 at Ravindra Bharathi.
 
 "The number of theatre lovers are increasing every day, I want to bring world class theatre to Hyderabad", said Mohammad Ali Baig, the co-founder of the Qadir Ali Baig Theatre Foundation. "The audiences would have an abundance of plays to choose from every weekend," he added.
 
 Since 2004, the foundation has been devoted to theatre revival in Hyderabad. While it has brought some of illustrious names in theatre from different cities of the world, it has also commendably produced original theatre that has been acclaimed globally.
 
 "I am excited for the upcoming fest. As a film maker, I always look upon people who come from theatre background," said  , an upcoming film maker. "I feel they are the real artist," he added.
 
 Theatre artists blame the lack of pay for people shifting to other streams like television or movies from this art form. Lack of platforms is also one of the reasons for artists moving to different platforms. However the city has seen a rise in theatre artists and audiences carving for plays.
 
 "Artist should realise we have a dedicated audience and we should maintain the same loyalty towards them," said a senior theatre artist, who refused to disclose his identity.
 
 "With shows at Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Herisson en Fete in France, USA, Turkey and Canada, the foundation's original plays based on Indian heritage and history have received acclaim across cultures," added Md Ali Baig.
