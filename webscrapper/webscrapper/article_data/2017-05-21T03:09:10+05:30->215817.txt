AHMEDABAD: The   at   will hold its first meeting on Monday. The   is being chaired by former IAS officer C L Meena. The other members are R C Raval, former director of primary education,  , chairman of Kadi Sarva Vidyalaya, chartered accountant Durgesh Buch and Narendra Patel, engineer, Auda.

 The committee will discuss applications for higher fees and scrutinize them. The when and how of implementing the new fee structure will discussed. This is the first meeting of the Ahmedabad committee while other regional committees have already met once or twice.
 
 The Ahmedabad committee covers Ahmedabad city, Ahmedabad rural, Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Patan, Sabarkantha, Banaskantha, Arvalli, Botad and Kutch. No self-financed school seeking higher fees under the Ahmedabad committee has so far submitted account-related documents. On the contrary, some 150 schools whose fees will remain under the cap, have submitted affidavits to the committee.
 
 Sources said that most schools are currently readying their documents. Applications will come in by the weekend. Schools looking for higher fees had sought an extension of May 24 deadline to submit the documents to the committee. The state government denied this request. “The form to apply is quite detailed. Moreover, most schools have not been maintaining projection data so that has to be appropriately presented. The process of submitting account books is also time taking and the deadline should be extended,” said M P Chandran, trustee of JG International School, who is also the spokesperson of the Association of Progressive Schools.
 
 Sources said schools are concerned about the fee committee deciding their fees suo motu if they are unable to submit documents.
