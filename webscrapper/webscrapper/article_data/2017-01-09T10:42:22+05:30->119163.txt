DARBHANGA: In a shocking incident, mother of a patient admitted in orthopaedic ward of   and Hospital (DMCH), was allegedly raped on Saturday night by an ‘unauthorised’ paramedical staff (dresser) working in the department. 

 Police sources said when the victim approached the accused, Bipin Kumar, to plaster the fractured leg of her son, he took her to a nearby place outside the hospital premises and allegedly raped her. When the victim cried for help, the attendants of other patients reached the spot and overpowered the accused with the help of security guards deployed in the hospital. On getting information, Benta outpost (OP) SHO arrested the accused and informed the women police station located in Laheriasarai. 
 
 Darbhanga sadar SDPO Dilnawaz Ahmad on Sunday said the women police station SHO has already recorded the victim’s statement and lodged an FIR. A medical board has been constituted to examine the victim. The clothes of both the rape survivor and the accused have been sent to forensic science laboratory (FSL) for investigation. 
 
 DMCH superintendent Dr S K Mishra said the accused is not a hospital employee. He might be frequenting the hospital like many others. “He is an outsider and has not been employed by the DMCH,” he said. 
 
 However, some of the attendants of the patients said the accused used to do dressing on payment. This incident has raised some questions on the hospital functioning. “If he was an outsider, how he was present in the ward during night hours. DMCH owes an answer to this question,” said the attendants who rescued the woman.
