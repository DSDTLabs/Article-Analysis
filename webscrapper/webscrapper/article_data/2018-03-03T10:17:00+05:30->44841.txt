 Asked whether a casual labourer could handle high-risk nitrocellulose compound, Singh said, “We don’t know why he was at the gun cartridge section. We have initiated an inquiry in this connection.”
 
 He was also not sure about the compensation to be paid to the family of  . “We have to check with the insurance company. As he was a casual labour, we may have to fix it at higher level,” Singh said.
 
 Pointing out that risk was involved in work at any section of the ordnance factory dealing with chemicals, an employee, who didn’t want to be named, said, “Hence, the factory management should hire only permanent trained staff.”
 
 The body was, meanwhile, handed over to the kin of the deceased after postmortem on Friday.
 
 The Aruvangadu police have registered a case. “Investigation is underway to ascertain the cause of the explosion,” an investigating official told TOI.
