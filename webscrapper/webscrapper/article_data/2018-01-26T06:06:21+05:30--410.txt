KOLKATA: On Wednesday night, the traffic police control room posted messages on  , alerting motorists of slow vehicle movement on   and Majherhat Bridge. What triggered the snarls at these two places, and in other parts of the city, was   immersions. Inebriated youths burst fire crackers and gyrated in the middle of the road to pulsating music and psychedelic lights.

 At  , a bus driver was roughed up by agroup of revellers because the former did not give their truck the right of way.
 
 Saraswati Puja stood apart from all other festivals because it was primarily organised by students and celebrations and was rather a low-budget and muted affair. This year, though, the divide appears to have been blurred with the dadas taking over the pujas.
 
 Even, extortion made a debut this year. Press owner   from Muchipara complained that goons had threatened her of dire consequence if she did not cough up Rs 50,000 as subscription.
 
 “From managing funds to organizing functions, men with political patronage now hold complete sway over   Puja,” said a teacher from south Kolkata.
 
 While police did not have to bother too much about Saraswati Puja immersions earlier, this year more than 300 cops had to be deployed to manage immersion of 1,598 at Babughat.
