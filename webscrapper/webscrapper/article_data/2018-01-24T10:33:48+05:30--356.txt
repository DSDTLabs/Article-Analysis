PANAJI: Cautioning taxi operators to remain vigilant about promises given by the government, the   on Tuesday said assurances given by the same regime in the past were never met. AAP convener Elvis  , in a statement, also congratulated the operators for maintaining peace during their strike. 

 “Polticians have used and abused the taxi operators. Just because of a few errant operators, the entire industry should not be branded as bad. The government only has the suited and booted on its agenda. Why doesn’t anyone question the airlines or others in the tourism industry that increase their fares at will?” Gomes asked.
