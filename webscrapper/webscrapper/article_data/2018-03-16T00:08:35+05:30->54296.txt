Chandigarh: There’s no doubt that multiple issues played important roles to give the ‘poorest’ ranking to the Chandigarh MC in the annual survey of India’s city systems (ASICS), 2017, conducted by Janaagraha, a Bengaluru-based non-profit institution. However, lack of public   has also emerged as one of the crucial segments in the survey. Significantly, this is the second such survey where poor public participation has turned out to be a major setback for the city.

 Last year, too, UT had drastically slipped from the second to 11th position in the Swachh Survekshan and the most crucial reason was the lack of public participation. The city had done well in other parameters, but in public participation, it turned out ‘poor’, which affected the entire result of the Survekshan for the City Beautiful.
 
 “Citizens inputs, their views and participation are the most important segments for any survey. In our survey, Chandigarh has not been doing much in this regard and thus the city’s ranking slipped. Though, we have found out that in many places the government doesn’t want to engage the common public due to reasons which are best known to them, but the fact is that in the Town Planning Act, it is one of the basic requirements,” said Anil Nair, head, advocacy, Janaagraha.
 
 There are examples in the city where initiatives could not click due to lack of public engagement. In the source segregation, due to lack of public participation, it could not turn out to be a success in the city. Though, MC held some meetings with public and distributed bins, it failed to click in the city. There was low public participation when it came to installing solar panels in their respective private houses.
