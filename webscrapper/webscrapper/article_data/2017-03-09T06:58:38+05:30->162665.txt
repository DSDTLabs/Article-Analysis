GURUGRAM: A team of   on Wednesday disconnected   of two households in Sector 46 for failing to pay taxes. 

 “Three of them sought a grace period, promising to clear the dues within two days. But, the remaining two defaulters did not make any such promise and thus, we disconnected their water and sewer connections. The connections will be restored only after they clear their dues,” executive engineer Gopal Kalavat said.
 
 MCG officials said that they would continue with the drive in coming days. “There are several defaulters who have not paid property taxes yet despite multiple reminders. Several teams have been formed to recover the dues. And if defaulters fail to pay up, we will disconnect their water and sewer connections,” said another official.
