Midnapore: With former Jhargram SP   Ghosh and constable Sujit Mandal, both accused in the cash-for-gold case out of bounds, the West Bengal CID questioned one of Ghosh’s chauffeurs Dalbir Singh about her whereabouts through Thursday. 

 Investigators also wanted to find out Ghosh’s frequently visited places in Midnapore before conducting fresh raids. The investigating agency is likely to take Singh into custody. 
 
 In another development, a goldsmith from West Midnapore’s Keshpur has come forward to lodge a police complaint against former cop Ghosh, taking the number of police complaints to four (two others from Daspur in West Midnapore and one from Swarupnagar in North 24 Parganas). 
 
 Ranjit Majhi, of Pindorageria, wrote to Jhargram SP Alok Rajoria on Thursday levelling an extortion charge against Keshpur police. In his complaint, Majhi alleged Keshpur officer-in-charge Khondekar Saifuddin Ahmed said they were doing so under “madam’s instructions” (hinting at Ghosh). Rajoria told TOI he was yet to look into the complaint.
 
 Majhi said the extortion bid happened on the night of October 24, 2017 when he was returning to his Keshpur home along with two others from Mumbai. “When the car reached Panchami More, policemen led by Keshpur OC stopped us and took the three of us to police station,” he said in his complaint. 
 
 The policemen asked for gold ornaments from the three when they realised they were goldsmiths, Majhi further alleged a thrashing when the three said they had no gold on them. “They, then, asked us each to come with Rs 1 lakh the next day. They said they were asking for the money under madam’s instructions. We could arrange Rs 50,000 each,” he alleged.
 
 Sanjay Mandal from Midnapore town, too, complained to police that Midnapore police led by Ghosh had ousted him and his family from their home three years ago in 2015 taking sides with his brother Sujay. This complaint has nothing to do with the cash-for-gold case.
