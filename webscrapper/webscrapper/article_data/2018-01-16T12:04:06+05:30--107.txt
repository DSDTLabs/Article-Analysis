 heavyweight   has finally spoken on  's claim of sexual harassment by ' ' stunt co-ordinator and called Eliza a 'courageous' woman for speaking out about the incident.

  
  
 
  The veteran actor responded to a tweet by   costar Tom Arnold, who said that he, Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, and James Cameron would have done something if they had known what happened.
 
  He tweeted, "Tom, you bet you're a** all of us would have done something. I'm shocked and saddened for Eliza but I am also proud of her - beyond being a great talent and an amazing woman, she is so courageous."
 
  
  
  Yesterday, the film's lead actress Jamie Lee Curtis also praised Eliza for coming out and speaking about the incident, saying "she "has awakened us to a new, horrific reality".
 
  Director James Cameron had also praised Duskhu for her bravery in speaking out and said had he had any inkling about such behaviour, 'there would've been no mercy'.
 
  Dushku accused True Lies stunt coordinator   of assault in a lengthy Facebook post last Saturday.
 
  Meanwhile, Kramer has denied Dushku's claims calling them as 'atrocious lies'.
 
  He has been fired by his agency, following molestation allegations.
