MUZAFFARNAGAR: Deeply dismayed by the state of illiteracy among women of their community, two Muslim friends have taken up the task of educating them from their own meagre sources. Working as teachers, the two – Faiz-Ur-Rehman, 25 and  , 26 – decided to uplift the women of their community when one day, three years ago, they witnessed the “humiliation” of one Muslim woman who chose to put thumb impression on the register of a polling booth.
 
  “That day, I decided to do something about it, in whatever small way I could,” said  . Soon after the incident he discussed the issue with his childhood friend,  , who readily agreed to the proposal. Till date, the duo has made close to 750 women literate and has even formed a small team to teach more women. They now run two centres at   and   in the city where 55 women currently studies.
  
  The duo is helped by another friend,  , a teacher at a local school. They have also hired two female teachers for the project. Rehman said that they spend around 25% of their salaries for the endeavour every month.
  
  “We consider getting paid as long as they can read the newspaper and not rely on anyone to fill up forms. We are planning to cater to women in rural areas as well,” said Ahmad.
  
  The group of giggling and confident women in the centre said, almost in unison, how it has been a dream for them to read and write. Saista Begum, 40, said, “I used to feel very sad seeing my brothers go to school. I wanted to get education but could not.”
  
  “I am confident and proud of myself now. I can read Hindi, English and Mathematics. Earlier, I used to feel humiliated whenever I had to give my thumb impression. I sign off forms in English now,” said Salma Parveen, another student.
