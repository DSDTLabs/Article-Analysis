NEW DELHI: The missing Sukhoi-30MKI fighter, which is feared to have crashed with its two pilots towards the border with China on Tuesday morning, is yet to be traced despite several aircraft and helicopters as well as ground search parties being pressed into service. 

 “Inclement weather in the thickly-forested region is hampering the search mission. There has been no breakthrough in locating the Sukhoi-30MKI or its pilots till now,” said an officer on Wednesday evening. Apart from   and   advanced light helicopters, the   has also deployed C-130J “Super Hercules” and Sukhoi-30MKIs with electro-optical sensors for the operation. Nine ground search parties from  , four from IAF and two state administration teams are also working on “different axes” from the last known position of the twin-engine fighter around 60km northwest of   when radar and radio contact was lost with it. 
 
 “No signals from the locator beacons on board the jet have also been detected. The beacons will have a limited emitting range if the fighter has gone down in a valley,” said an officer. Being flown by a squadron leader and flight lieutenant, the Sukhoi had gone missing 40 minutes after it took off in a two-aircraft formation from the Tezpur airbase at about 10.30 am. This is the eight reported crash of the Sukhoi-30MKIs, which are the latest and the most potent fighters in the IAF’s combat fleet.
