NEW DELHI: To prove a point, US Senator   yesterday carried to the Senate a giant printout of a tweet by America's favourite tweeter,  , The Hill reported.
 
 "Let me quote somebody who I suspect I will not often be quoting," Sanders said, according to The Hill. Most would have been surprised he quoted the US President-elect at all.
 
 But Sanders wanted to make a point and that's something he does very well indeed. Yesterday, he planned to speak about changes the incoming Republican President Trump plans to make to   - the Senate is considering a repeal of Obamacare - the US healthcare plan. And that's where Trump's tweet came in.
 
 "On May 7, 2015, Donald Trump tweeted, 'I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security,   & Medicaid,'" said Sanders.
 
 
 Here's that original tweet:
 
 
 
 
 
 "Now the point is Trump didn't just say this in passing," Sanders recalled, pointing to the huge printout of the tweet he was referring to. "This was a cornerstone of his campaign. He (Trump) said it over and over and over again," Sanders said.
 
 Now, if Trump backtracks and cuts Medicare and Medicaid, he will have to admit he was lying. 
 
 Clearly, this story isn't over yet, not by a long shot.
