FAIZABAD: Bahujan Samaj Party workers of Barabanki are up in arms against the party’s decision to give Kursi assembly seat’s ticket to retired PCS officer  , who -- they allege -- was part of the guest house case conspiracy in June 1995 to ‘eliminate’  . They have written a letter to the   chief to reconsider the decision to field Verma.

 The letter signed by a large number of local party office0bearers says that Verma served as city magistrate in Lucknow on June 2, 1995 when   workers -- following withdrawal of support by BSP to the coalition government -- allegedly confined Mayawati to the state guest house on Meerbai Barg in Lucknow and tried to kill her.
 
 Verma then had played a major role in snapping the power supply to the guest house and tried to block other assistance being extended to the ‘incarcerated’ BSP leader, the letter alleges, adding “as a result, he was transferred on June 13, 1995, after BSP came to power with BJP’s support”.
 
 The BSP leaders have also said that Verma has an anti-Dalit midset and is an old associate of SP leader Beni Prasad Verma and also close to present minister Arvind Singh Gope. “He was given ticket as part of conspiracy to weaken the party by zonal coordinator Lalji Verma,” they say.
 
 BSP’s Kursi unit chief Arjun Rawat told TOI that Behenji (Mayawati) had been informed about Verma’s background and his association with the guest house case. 
 
 When contacted, BP Singh Varma, however, refused to comment on allegations. “I have been given ticket by Behenji and I am working tirelessly in my constituency,” said the retired officers, who joined BSP some times back.
 
 Giving a clean chit to Verma, Suresh Gautam , BSP’s Barabanki district president said: “He was a government officer then and may have worked under pressure from his higher-ups. You cannot blame a government officer for sins committed by political parties.”
