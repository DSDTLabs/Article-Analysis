Aditi Rao Hydari, actor, shares her   with us.

 
  - My playground. 
 
 
 - Transparent. 
 
 
 - A free-spirited soul, rooted in tradition.
 
 
  Inherently classic, often whimsical, and, very often, boho chic. 
 
 
 Dancing. 
 
 
  Jeans and shorts of different kinds, a sari with a well-fitted blouse,   essentials, a pair of white sneakers and a versatile bag. 
 
 
 My sensitivity. Everyone says I need to be thick-skinned but I never want to let go of my sensitivity and my belief in magic. It’s my strength. 
 
 
 
 
 - A skater dress and booties. 
 
  - Depends on the workplace. 
 
 - A pair of shorts with a ganji, complete with a layer and a pair of sneakers. 
 
  - That would be at the beach, and I would definitely be in my beach wear. 
 
 
  If you love it buy it. 
 
 
  The beauty of the soul outlasts that of your face. So, enhance your soul. Look after your skin, and try going natural. 
 
 
  Layering. An outfit can go from classic to boho, desi to formal with help of a layer. 
 
 
 
 
 Sneakers 
 Flip flops 
 Juttis/kolhapuris 
 Booties
 Of course, heels – I don’t like heels, but I have to admit, they look amazing
