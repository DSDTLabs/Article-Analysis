MOHALI: Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) on Saturday dug up the approach road and the parking bays of the old   in Phase VIII of Mohali to take possession of around 6 acres of prime land worth Rs 100 crore. The   will now auction the land for setting up business-cum-shopping centre at the site.

 A team of Gmada officials, supported by local police, started demolishing the bus stand on Saturday morning. An official supervising the demolition said private bus operators and dhaba owners were asked to vacate the premises.
 
 Four JCB machines were pressed into action, which dug five foot deep trenches around the bus stand, restricting buses to enter the premises. The approach road and the parking bays were also dug.
 
 Gmada chief administrator   said, “The land belongs to the Gmada and the said bus stand was illegal. So the authority has taken back the possession of its land.”
 
 Sources in the Gmada said the main structure will also be demolished within a few days after which the land would be auctioned. Sources added that the authority has plans to develop a city centre here, which will be a hub for business, shopping malls and multiplexes.
 
 Meanwhile, Mohali   Balbir Singh Sidhu said that he was firm on his stand to get a local bus stand at the site, which has been demolished by the authority.
 
 “I will talk to the CM on Monday in this regard. We are here to see public convenience and not generating revenue. One local bus stand is required at Phase VIII as it becomes difficult for people living in Phase IX, X, XI to approach the bus stand of Phase VI,” the MLA said.
 
 Earlier Mohali MLA   had sent a proposal for the revival of the old bus stand to the ministry.
