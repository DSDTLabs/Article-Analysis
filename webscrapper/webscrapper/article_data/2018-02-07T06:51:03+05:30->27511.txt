LUCKNOW: The case of standard IX student  , who was found dead on   campus in April 2015, is far from over. In reply to an   query, city police have told Rahul’s parents that the crime scene was yet to be reconstructed.

 Rahul’s mother and father work at SGPGI as senior technician and nursing supervisor respectively. While the college authorities said the boy had jumped from the Constantia building to commit suicide, his parents suspected foul play and had moved an application before Gautampalli police station.
 
 SSP Deepak Kumar said the previous SHO was transferred because of family problems.
 
 “I will check with my counterparts the status of probes and coordinate with Mahanagar forensic laboratory,” said Kumar. An FIR under murder was pressed against unknown persons and police began probe. In October 2015, police closed investigations, seconding the suicide theory.
 
 However, the chief judicial magistrate ordered re-investigation in November 2015 and directed police to finish investigation within six months. “I just want police to find how Rahul sustained injuries. If we believe he jumped from the building, the pattern of injuries on his body seem inconsistent with the theory,” said the boy’s mother Anamma S.
 
 Police responded to the query on January 18 and told Anamma that the reconstruction would be conducted soon.
