LUCKNOW: With barely six months left to meet the deadline to make Lucknow open defecation-free ( ),   is looking to make pre-cast and mobile toilets that are easy to install in areas prone to the problem.

 Since these toilets are precast, they take only about three days to be installed unlike regular toilets which are built over two weeks.
 
 LMC had identified 141 spots where open defecation was a major issue. It had targeted to build 90 public toilets in the first phase but late disbursement of funds, delay in land clearance and procedural bottlenecks led to only one fourth of those being built till now.
 
 With a deadline of October 2 and paucity of funds, LMC has now roped in a private company to provide design and cost structure of these light-weight, easy to transport readymade toilets.
 
 These will be installed in the remaining 51 of the 141 spots. The company will also provide a comprehensive plan to LMC on achieving ODF status soon.
 
 The doors of these toilets will have paintings and messages displayed on them to encourage people to use them.
 
 A helpline number will also be displayed for users.
 
 One   costs only Rs 12,000 per seat and can be connected to the existing supply and sewerage line.
