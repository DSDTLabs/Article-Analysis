COIMBATORE: While expressing disappointment over the Supreme Court verdict reducing the quantum of   water to be released for Tamil Nadu, chief minister Edappadi K   on Saturday said that certain points in the judgement should be welcomed. 

 Talking to reporters at the airport here, Palaniswami said that the verdict was the result of a case filed by former chief minister   in the apex court. "She had requested the court to constitute the Cauvery management board and Cauvery water regulation committee. The court, on Friday, ordered the Union government to constitute the Cauvery management board and water regulation committee within six months," he said.
 
 "We hope the Union government will constitute the Cauvery management board and water regulation committee soon. Our legal experts will go through the entire judgement and based on their suggestions, further action will be taken," Palaniswami said.
