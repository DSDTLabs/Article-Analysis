NAGPUR: I strongly believe that   is a very scoring subject and you just need to read the textbooks in brief. Once you know your lessons thoroughly you can expand your answers and deliver quality writing.

 A major benefit is that only the questions printed behind the chapter are asked most of the times. You should pay attention on framing the sentences correctly and use proper tenses. Avoid overwriting and scratching and keep your answer sheet clean and presentable.
 
 Start your essay with a proper introduction which highlights the importance of the topic. While concluding, you should sum up with your views about it. Even if the length of the essay is short but it has minimal mistakes of ‘matras’ (spellings) , you will gain good marks. Use quotes from eminent personalities to attract valuer’s attention.
 
 Don’t forget to highlight these quotes and important point in your answers. When you are asked to write down the summary for a chapter or poem, mentioning the name of writer/poem will secure one mark for sure. Time management is very essential. Keep a target of solving 4 questions in the first 1.5 hour. Do not attempt the ‘creative writing’ part in the beginning. Some students have a tendency to leave a blank space for author’s/poet’s name. They miss out on it due to forgetfulness or lack of time. This creates a negative impact on the valuer. 
 
 Many students don’t read the questions properly out of anxiety. You should absorb the questions, prepare a systemic body, then go ahead. You should know the important dates, facts and terminology in chapters. There is a choice between letter writing and advertisement. I advise you to attempt letter as it has step wise marking scheme like Maths. Just picking out the correct information from the question and arranging it in required format will help you score four on five marks.
