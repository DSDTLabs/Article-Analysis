Surat: A police team was attacked in Limbayat area of the city on Sunday night when it went to raid a place following information about bootlegging activity there. 

 Preliminary investigation revealed that the policemen were attacked by bootleggers who pelted their vehicles with stones and forced them to leave. None of the accused was arrested even 24 hours after the incident. 
 
 A case of rioting was registered against 14 men and women at Limbayat police station. Among those booked was history-sheeter Munna alias Langda Lakshmiprasad Yadav, a bootlegger of the area, who also used to run a gambling den in the past.
 
 The police team had gone to conduct a check at Ratan Chowk in Limbayat after four persons were found in suspicious condition in a car. The police team found a bottle of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) from their possession. They started arguing with the policemen, including police inspector M V Patel when they were about to place them under arrest. Local people from the area did not let the policemen arrest the accused and began to throw stones at them. The policemen had to leave the spot without arresting the accused. However, the policemen returned with more men, but by then the accused had fled the spot. 
 
 Munna had good equations with local politicians whom he uses to pressurize the police, sources said. His political connections had helped him run his illegal business for the last so many years. “The accused are still on the run. We have launched a manhunt to nab them,” police said.
