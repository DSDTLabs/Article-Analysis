PUNE: In a bid to increase its daily trash treatment capacity, the   is planning to start a 750-tonne garbage   at   near   to process mixed waste.

 An official in the corporation’s solid waste management department said a plan had been chalked out to increase the city’s garbage processing capacity in a phased manner. “Starting a mixed garbage processing plant is among many initiatives planned. The civil work of the plant is expected to start in the next few days. An agency has been appointed for setting up and operating the facility. The plant will be made operational in the next one year,” the official said.
 
 The local corporators demanded that the garbage plant be shifted from Ramtekdi to some other location. The civic official, however, said there was no plan as of now to shift the plant to a new location.
 
 The city’s daily garbage generation has gone up by almost 500 tonnes after the merger of 11 villages in the civic limits last year. According to sources, the city’s daily garbage generation has gone up to 2,000 tonnes from 1,500 tonnes in the past six months. 
 
 The corporation is processing about 1,000 tonnes of garbage at the existing plants. The rest is dumped at the depot and other places.
