Vijayawada: With less than two weeks to go for the Andhra Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test ( ), which was already postponed by three weeks after numerous requests, students have little choice but to take the exam.

 Experts say that APTET aspirants should now use the time effectively to prepare for the exam, which will begin on   5. The test will be fully conducted online for the first time. Some 4.33 lakh aspirants across AP have applied for the exam for 12,370 posts. Experts say students should focus on the content — psychology, Telugu, and English — as they carry 90 marks out of 150 for paper I and II.
 
 There are three papers in the TET exam. Paper I is for secondary grade teachers (SGT), and students who have completed or will appear for diploma in Education (DEd) exam in 2018. Those who have completed bachelors in education (BEd) are eligible for paper II, which is subject-based exam. Paper III is for Hindi and Telugu pundits, and for English assistants.
 
 Experts say that instead of trying to cover more topics, students should now thoroughly study the topics they have already covered. Practising old TET question papers is a wise thing to do, they say. 
 
 However, spending sometime going through main concepts will be helpful.
 
 Jumpana Sudhakar, director at Pratibha Coaching Centre, says psychology is an important topic in all papers. He says students should not to underestimate Telugu. Small mistakes can cost a lot of marks, he says. Concept-oriented preparation along with grammar is required for English. 
 
 Students who are not exposed to computers or are scared of writing exams on computers should at least write two computer mock tests, said an analyst. Management of time while writing the two-and-a-half hour papers is also important.
