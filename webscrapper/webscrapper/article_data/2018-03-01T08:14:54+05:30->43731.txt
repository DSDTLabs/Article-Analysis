BENGALURU: While summer is setting in, snakes are crawling out of their burrows in dozens, turning up everywhere — from the bedrooms of Bengalurueans’ homes to the gardens of Raj Bhavan.   officials say its helpline is getting nearly 60 snake-sighting and rescue calls a day.

  
 Mohan K, a snake rescuer, said soaring temperature (around 32 degrees Celsius as on Tuesday) and the fact that it is also the mating season for certain snake species are why Bengalureans are spotting these reptiles in large numbers. “Calls about snake sightings touch 50-60 a day from mid-February to September, after which they come down to 20-30. In summer, they venture out due to heat and during rainy season, water flushes them out of their burrows,” he explained.
 
 Mohan said during summer, the cold-blooded creatures go in search of cooler places and end up near water sumps, toilets and water coolers. “Recently, I rescued a snake from a dog kennel in an Ulsoor house. In   near Ramamurthynagar, a snake had entered the bedroom. Most commonly found ones in the city are cobra, rat snake and Russell’s viper,” he said.
 
 Snake rescuers say the reptiles are usually found on the outskirts of Bengaluru, where there are green spaces, vacant sites and waterbodies. “We get more calls from Banaswadi, KR Puram, Whitefield, Padmanabhanagar, HSR Layout, Bommanahalli, RR Nagar, Nagarbhavi, Peenya, Vidyaranyapura, Yelahanka, Hebbal and MS Palya,” he said.
 
 Sharath R Babu, a wildlife volunteer, says snakes do appear in interior Bengaluru too. “Unclean shoulder drains and stormwater drains form their hideouts,” he added.
