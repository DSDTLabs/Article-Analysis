PANAJI: Traffic on NH-17 (66) was hit at   as hundreds of protesters blocked the vehicular movement on both the bridges across River  .

 Agitators had assembled near the KTC bus terminus since morning to protest against the closure of mines in Goa. Police stopped these protesters from entering the city in view of class XII exams.
 
 As more people came from the hinterland, the agitators marched on to the bridges throwing the traffic out of gear. The new Mandovi bridge was completely chocked while one-way traffic moved on the old bridge. 
 
 Traffic jam at both the Mandovi bridges is going to severely affect tourist, especially those going to airport. These bridges are the main links to the capital city or to go to south Goa. Hundreds of policemen have been deployed here to prevent any law-and-order situation.
 
 Mining operations are shut in Goa since March 15 as per the Supreme Court order which termed the renewal of 88 leases as illegal. 
 
 Associations of mining-affected people gave a call for rally in the capital city to protest against the failure of the Manohar Parrikar-led government in find a solution to the mining crisis. 
 
 As the government is planning to auction the leases, the mining-affected persons have demanded that the government should move the central government or SC for resumption of mining in the interim period. 
 
 “We are moving to the apex court seeking to allow mining operations till alternate arrangement (auctioning process is over),” said PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar.
