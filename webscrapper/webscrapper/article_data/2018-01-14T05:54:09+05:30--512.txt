HYDERABAD: Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ( ) sleuths have arrested three persons while transporting 46-kg methaqualone, a banned substance, in a car at   village in   district. The seized drug could be worth 23 crore in the market. 

 DRI officials, in a press note issued on Saturday, said that on the basis of a tip-off that banned drug was being transported, they launched an operation on Thursday and intercepted a white Maruti   Brezza vehicle, bearing   registration number, at a toll plaza at Kamkole village in Sangareddy. The contraband, banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, was hidden in the false casing inside the car.
 
 "The banned substance was found to be concealed in the false casing behind the rear seats and on the side walls of the boot of the car and secured with metal covers. The false casing was cleverly masked by pasting a thick black coloured-cloth over it to avoid any suspicion. The officers, systematically, searched the car for all concealments and unearthed 46 packets, each containing one kilo gram of the contraband, from the side walls of the boot of the car,'' additional director-general (DRI) MK   said in the release. 
 
 Preliminary inquiries revealed the substance was loaded into the car by a person at   in   district in Maharashtra, who in turn had instructed the occupants to deliver the consignment to agents in Chennai.
 
 The DRI officials said methaqualone, a depressant, affects the central nervous system. The drug could have an effect of allured speech, motor dysfunction, nausea, vomiting, sweating, rapid heartbeat, hives, and dizziness, loss of appetite, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, memory loss and weakness. Over dose of methaqualone can be fatal, they added.
