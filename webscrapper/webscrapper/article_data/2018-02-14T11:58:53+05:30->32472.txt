CHENNAI: Every time a train halts at Chennai Beach  , commuters can be seen running helter-skelter to its nine platforms, caught in a confusion. The reason? The station, a suburban terminal from which EMU trains run in three different directions, does not have a digital   indicating the time of service, its destination and platform.

 This has emerged as a major challenge not only for commuters but also the staff at the station who are bombarded with questions. Announcements are made over the public address system but commuters feel they come moments before the train departs. This issue is unlikely to be resolved for a year more because the   board has asked the railways telecom arm, RailTel, to float a global tender to identify a contractor who can provide digital display boards across the country.
 
 From Chennai Beach, commuters can get trains to southern suburbs like  , Chengalpet, Tirumalpur and Kancheepuram as well as inside the city on the MRTS section. There are trains to western suburbs like Avadi and   as well from Beach.
 
 “I see it regularly where a train comes on platform 8 from Avadi and commuters rush to board it. But an announcement is given that the next train to leave is from platform 9. Many then rush to board that train,” said Sridhar Joshi, a regular commuter on the Avadi-MRTS cross-sectoral service which passes through Chennai Beach.
 
 Southern Railway has provided digital display boards at   and Egmore stations for long-distance passengers but not for suburban trains. “This issue is there in other suburban stations, including Tambaram. It was taken up at the divisional rail users consultative committee (DRUCC) meeting last month. People stand on over bridges and wait for the train to enter a platform before running down the stairs. This is not safe,” said K Baskar, a   member from Tiruvallur.
