MARGAO: The Goa Forward Party on Tuesday decided to back and support Edwin ‘Cipru’ Cardozo, an independent candidate from   constituency for the 2017 elections.

  president Prabhakar Timble said Cardozo is emerging as the front-runner in Navelim and with the backing of GFP, victory is a foregone conclusion. 
 
 Timble said that field reports from Navelim clearly indicate victory for Cardozo with state Congress president Luizinho Faleiro and fisheries minister Avertano Furtado fighting for second position.
 
 Regarding the move to disqualify Cardozo for allegedly filing a false affidavit during the zilla panchayat elections, Timble, who was the former state election commissioner said the SEC is not a criminal court to decide on such allegations. Advocate Arun Braz said that there is no case against   in any court.
