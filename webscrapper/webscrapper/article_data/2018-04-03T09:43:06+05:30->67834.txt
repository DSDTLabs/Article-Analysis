 Kumar was a teacher at a primary school in   and had given up his job to focus on religious issues. A few constables from   police station tried to convince him but had to run for cover when Kumar started relieving himself from where he was standing. 
  
 
  Fire Brigade reached the spot and put up a ladder. A fireman, speaking chaste Hindi, persuaded him by promising a proper place for prayer.
