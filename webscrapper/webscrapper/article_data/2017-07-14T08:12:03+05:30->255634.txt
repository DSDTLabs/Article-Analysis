THRISSUR: The popular Malayalam actress who was abducted and raped in February has refuted reports that she was involved in any property deal or business transaction with Dileep. 

 In a statement released on Thursday, the actress said that though Dileep and she had acted in several films, their friendly relationship had soured due to personal issues later. She also said that she did not deliberately make anyone an accused in the case because of personal enmity.
 
 Saying that recent developments in her case have shocked her, she said she was counting on the truth coming out.
 
 Meanwhile, Dileep was taken to three places in Thrissur as part of collecting evidence on Thursday. 
 
 Actor Aju Varghese was questioned for about one-and-a-half hours by the Kalamassery police probing a case against him for allegedly revealing the identity of the survivor in the actress rape case. The police seized the actor's phone and the memory card and they would undergo forensic examination. P 5
