She wanted to become a doctor," said Amna Malik, principal, AMU Girl's School. 
 
 Anam was accidentally hit after a quarrel between two bikers and a car driver near her school resulted in shots being fired. "She was brave and battled for life for eight long days.

Her friends and teachers are yet to come to terms with the fact that she is not among us anymore," added Malik.
 
 School authorities had sought donations for Anam's treatment as she came from an underprivileged family. "Unfortunately, the money collected was handed over to her family after her demise. Our teachers visited her parents on Wednesday and gave them Rs 40,000," added the principal. 
 
 Witnesses to the May 8 incident said bike-borne youths had got into a quarrel with a car driver near Anam's school. Soon, gunshots were fired, one of which hit Anam. "Mohd Nasir, who had opened fire, has been arrested. We are looking for his accomplices," Aligarh SSP Rajesh Pandey said.
