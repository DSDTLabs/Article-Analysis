Panaji: A priest at Shantadurga temple, Kavle, Ponda, was cheated by two persons of Rs 8.10 lakh after seeking details of his debit card with one of them posing as a RBI official.

 The cyber crime cell has lodged a FIR against Rajesh Kumar and Manoj Kumar under Section 420 (cheating) read with Section 34 of IPC and Section 66 D of the Information Technology Act. Vinayak Pendse lodged a complaint with the cybercrime cell of Goa police that on February 17, he received a call from Rajesh Kumar, claiming to be a RBI official from Mumbai, who sought his transaction details a month before and after the demonetization decision. The caller also claimed that he was with the Income Tax office, Mumbai.
 
 Pendse said he was reluctant to speak or part with his personal details, but believed in the caller’s claims when spelt out his Aadhar card number. Earlier, Pendse refused to reveal his Aadhar card number. Later, the person claiming to be the RBI official sought his debit card number, but asked not to reveal the PIN. Within a half hour of his conversation, Pendse said he received 23 messages from the bank about withdrawals from his account. “Rs 8.10 lakh was withdrawn,”he said.
