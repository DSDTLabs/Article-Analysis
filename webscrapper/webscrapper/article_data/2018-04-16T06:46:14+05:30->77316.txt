BENGALURU: Just because a woman lives in a village, she can’t be denied a reasonable amount of maintenance by her husband, the   high court has said.

 “Merely because the wife happens to be living in a village, it doesn’t mean she is not entitled to an amount of Rs 25,000 per month. Considering that even a fourth-classemployee earns more than that as monthly salary, a sum of Rs 25,000 as interim maintenance is rather reasonable, just and fair,” Justice   observed in his order. He rejected a petition filed by  , a Bengaluru businessman against paying maintenance to his wife,  .
 
 The judge noted that even poverty is no defence in a maintenance application as the husband is both morally and legally bound to maintain his wife. Even she has to maintain her body, soul and mind and has to lead the lifestyle that she became accustomed to after marrying the petitioner, a businessman, the judge said.
 
 Counsel for the petitioner contended that Rs 25,000 was toolarge a sum tobe paidtothe wife as interim maintenance as she lives in a village in Rajasthan.
 
 Sandeep had challenged the February 1, 2018 order passed by the family court in Bengaluru asking him to pay interim maintenance of Rs 25,000toVandana, who livesin Hanumangarh, Rajasthan. He contended that his wife deserted him in January 2015 and sought divorce. She’d filed an application seeking Rs 75,000 per month as maintenance.
