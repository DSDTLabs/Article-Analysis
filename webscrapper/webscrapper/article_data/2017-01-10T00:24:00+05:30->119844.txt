PUNE: Government land leased to cooperative societies, educational institutes and societies may soon get ownership rights if the tenure conversion report rules are cleared by the state government.

 These rules are being made for land plots leased out to various institutes in the state by the government.
 
 A   headed by the principal secretary (revenue) has been working on the report and rules. Senior   told TOI that the report would be submitted soon.
 
 The issue was taken up last year. It is being seen as an avenue for the cash strapped government to draw more funds.
 
 “Once the committee submits the report, the rules will be evaluated to take decisions on such properties,” stated a senior revenue official under condition of anonymity.
 
 Another revenue official said that these rules will probably be for properties leased out by the government for over 30 years which the government is not likely to take back. “If this gets cleared, many cooperative societies,   will benefit,” the official said. The district Collectors will have to prepare the list of such lands once the rules are out.
 
 “This would ensure that if the lease owner is able to pay the amount as premium then they would be freed from renewing their lease or undertake new registration,” said the official.
 
 Properties that have completed over 99 years of lease will also be exempt from lease renewals on payment of the premium.
 
 Officials from the department said there would be a good revenue generated if the rules come through.
 
 The revenue department had tentatively worked out the list of such properties as it is believed that the revenue generated from these properties is not enough.
 
 There was also a drive carried out to check the lease status of the properties. Fines and penalties were issued to the organizations wherever necessary.
