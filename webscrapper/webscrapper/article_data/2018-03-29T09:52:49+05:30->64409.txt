CHENNAI: Herds of stray cattle randomly dispersed on the roads have been a source of alarm and potential danger - not to mention irritability due to the hold-ups they cause - for motorists in the city. But things could be changing. 

  has tightened enforcement of rules against buffaloes, cows and oxen roaming the streets, fining the owners of stray cattle no less than 7.55 lakh and impounding 422 animals from January through March this year. 
 
 According to officials in the veterinary public health wing of the civic body's health department, in 95% of the registered cases, the owners paid the penalty to retrieve their cattle. The corporation will send the remaining cattle at the   shelter.
 
 The civic body in January increased the penalty - almost tenfold in most cases - from 1,000 per stray animal cattle below three years old and 1,250 (three years old or more) to a flat 10,000 per head. It also increased maintenance charges that owners have to pay for the period that the corporation impounds animals from 100 to 750 per animal daily. 
 
 The corporation seized 147 cows and buffaloes in January and fined their owners 2.69 lakh. It seized 151 animals in February (and collected 2.61 lakh in fines), and 124 (collecting 2.26 lakh in penalties) animals till March 28. 
 
 "We have vehicles to impound cattle in all 15 zones of the city," a corporation official said. "The civic body has tried to increase awareness among owners so there would be fewer offences."
 
 The campaign to make cattle owners more mindful of the rules does not seem to have worked, but perhaps the sting paying high penalties will.
