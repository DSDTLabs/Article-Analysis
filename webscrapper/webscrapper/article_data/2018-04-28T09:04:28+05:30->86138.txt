MUMBAI: Almost a month after the conclusion of the T20 Mumbai League, the 119 players, coaches and other members of the support staff involved in the tournament have finally begun receiving their dues from the   (MCA).

 
 “The payment (to the tune of Rs 3 crores) was cleared by the   (CoA) a couple of days back. The players need to show a copy of their PAN card and GST certificates (in case they’re supposed to receive payment in excess of Rs 10 lakh). We’ve sent them a message to collect their demand drafts (DDs), which were ready by April 10,” an MCA official told TOI.
 
 Recently, former Mumbai wicketkeeper and coach   had written a letter to the Bombay High Court-appointed CoA, which includes retired judges   and VM Kanade, urging it to look into the issue of pending payments. The 
 
 T20 League was held from March 11-21. All the team owners had subsequently deposited the money due to the players, coaches and support staff with the MCA. The association wanted to disburse the payments on its own.
