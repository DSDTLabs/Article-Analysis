SHIMLA: Though chief minister Virbhadra Singh has directed officials to restore supply of Giri water supply scheme and ensure daily water supply to people of Shimla and its suburbs, the BJP on Monday held a protest outside the municipal corporation office and blamed alleged lack of coordination between the state government and civic body for no water supply for four days.

 Hundreds of BJP workers gathered near the DC and MC office complex, where they raised slogans for failure of both in ensuring regular supply of drinking water to residents.
 
 Party leaders claimed that government had no control over the departments concerned, which were blaming each other. They said that with tourist season to start soon, it would further aggravate the problem.
 
 On Saturday, Virbhadra had presided over a meeting of officers of the   (IPH) and Electricity Departments and MC. During the meeting he had warned action against officials failing to plug leakages and overflow of water tanks. He also directed the IPH department officials to complete work on the Rs 105 crore Garoh-Gandal water supply scheme in   segment by mid of April, which is catering to a population of around 75,000 of 41 panchayats. In the meeting it was stated that there was total requirement of 44 MLD of water within MC limits and outside the MC limits it was around 4 MLD. Principal secretary, IPH,   said that the entire main line of Giri water supply scheme was being replaced and the work had almost been completed, which would add 5-6 MLD to the existing supply.
 
 Since   was closed in January, 2016, still there was loss of water of around 9-10 MLD, approximately. Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation vice-chairman Harish Janartha said that proper supply should be ensured in the town at fixed timings.
