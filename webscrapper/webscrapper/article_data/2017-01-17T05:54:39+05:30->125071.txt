NEW DELHI: The selection of the next chief of   (CBI) may not be restricted to the four batches of police service officers under consideration if the search committee does not find a compelling choice.

 The search panel that includes PM  , Chief Justice of India J S Khehar and Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, met on Monday evening but there was no word of a decision being arrived at.
 
 Sources maintained the search panel and government is not prevented from looking at candidates beyond the 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982 batches of Indian Police Service officers under consideration. The guidelines for a wide talent search were set out by the Supreme Court but the government feels there is no restriction in expanding the base.
 
 If the committee decides to widen the search, CBI’s acting director Rakesh Asthana could be in reckoning though he is from the more junior 1984 batch and this can increase the odds against his selection somewhat.
 
 The senior officers who figure in the list of eligibles includes Meera Borwankar, chief of Bureau of Police Research and Development, Delhi Police Commissioner Alok Verma, Maharashtra Director General of Police Satish Mathur, Sashastra Seema Bal Director-General Archana Ramasundaram and ITBP chief Krishna Chaudhary.
 
 The selection of the   has attracted controversy as Congress has said Asthana’s designation as acting chief should have been done after consulting Kharge who protested the decision. Since then the government said the process of selecting the new agency chief will be concluded soon.
 
 In recent weeks, CBI has moved against Trinamool leaders accused of complicity in the Rose Valley chit fund case and has charge sheeted  , former principal secretary to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.
 
 Both AAP and Trinamool have accused the Centre of using the CBI but government sources insist that the agency has gone by evidence and levelling political charges will not impress a trial court that will weigh evidence.
