An insane main event ensured that the first-ever   WWE pay-per-view was a huge hit with Brock Lesnar and Samoa Joe putting on a physical fight. Lesnar eventually beat Joe with a F5 to retain the Universal Championship. 

 However, Joe came out of the fight with much credibility and similar to how he was booked -a legitimate tough guy who can beat Brock Lesnar – Joe had Lesnar under the pump many times. 
 
 Joe jumped Lesnar even before the match began, while Paul Heyman was introducing the champion, and drove the Universal champion through the announcers’ table. Lensar though made his way back and allowed the referee to start the match but he was met with an enzogiri and a flurry of punches in the corner. 
 
  
  
 
 Lesnar made a comeback with knees to Joe’s mid-section and executed three German Suplexes before Joe hit a low blow on Lensar without letting the referee seeing it. 
 
 Joe got the Coquina Clutch twice but Lesnar powered out and despite hitting himself on to the ring post he managed another trifecta of German Suplexes. 
 
 Joe showed some fight with another attempt at Coquina Clutch but Lesnar survived and hit an F5 on Joe to retain his title
