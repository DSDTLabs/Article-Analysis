 “Many people don't know anything about Tibet beyond the existence of the Dalai Lama. This is a good opportunity to tell them more,“ said Sangye, who is qualified to do so.

Walk-ins are common but registration is the norm during peak season, when each class can have more than 75 students a month.
 
 Sangey's is not alone in offering information with culinary expertise. In Lhamo's Kitchen, questions about kneading techniques are interspersed with those about the government in exile. Although the clientele in these classes is mainly European, there are some Tibetan students too.
