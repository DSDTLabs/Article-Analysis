MUMBAI: Several commuters, travelling by aggregator cabs like   and   on Tuesday morning, had to pay the surge price (double the normal fare) due to shortage of cabs in some areas. Sources said this was due to the indefinite   called by a union that represents a section of driver partners.

 Despite the strike nearly 60% cabs were ferrying passengers in the morning. A section of driver partners on Tuesday said they will continue the strike “indefinitely”.
 
 Said Yakub Mehta, who represents a section of driver partners: “We are protesting because we demand better earnings and security of drivers who have been assaulted recently.”
 
 A Uber spokesperson said: “We regret the disruption caused to our rider and driver-partner community, because of a small group of individuals.”
