LUCKNOW: Hindi as a subject has failed to attract students at the undergraduate level at  . While 115 seats out of 400 are vacant in   after completion of admission process, only six students took admission in BA (Hons) having 60 seats.

 A senior faculty in the department of Hindi, Prof Pawan Agarwal said, “BA (Hons) in Hindi got fewer students as the course has been introduced from this session."
 
 “Students want to pursue courses which are more job oriented. There is a need to revamp the traditional courses," said Prof SP Dixit, former head of the department of Hindi. Prof Dixit, who is also a writer, said if we introduce papers like media writing, translation, Hindi announcement and commentary in the course, it will attract more students.
 
 He said BA (Hons) in Hindi is a good professional course, still it failed to attract students, perhaps due to lack of communication.
 
 “BA Hindi has been getting an average response, but this year the number of applications has gone down possibly because students are more inclined towards professional courses," said prof Alka Pandey .
 
 LU admission coordinator, Anil Mishra said the number of students opting for subjects like Urdu, Arabic, Persian and Asian culture has also been low.
