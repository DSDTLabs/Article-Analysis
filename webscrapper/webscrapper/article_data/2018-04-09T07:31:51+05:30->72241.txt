VIJAYAPURA: Stating that both the Congress and BJP are two sides of the same coin, JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy on Sunday said they share a “one should beat and another would weep” agreement.

 “JD(S) is not the BJP’s B team as alleged by the Congress. On the contrary, leaders who were with Janata Pariwar migrated to the Congress and formed a B team, sidelining seniors like Mallikjarjuna Kharge and Parameshwara. The JD(S) wants to ensure employment opportunities for youth and women, loan waiver for farmers and check migration of farmers,” he said, addressing a gathering at Darbar high school grounds.
 
 He alleged that the BJP and the Congress are not concerned about problems of farmers and women. “They have not protected the interest of Muslims, instead are using minorities for political gains,” he added.
 
 Former minister Basavaraj Horatti, Nagathan constituency candidate Devanand Chavan, Indi constituency candidate B D Patil were present.

 “We have an advertisement government. Without doing any work, the Congress government publishes advertisements in all newspapers, spending huge amount. The money should have been used for welfare programmes,” the former CM said.
