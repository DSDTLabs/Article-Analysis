PATNA: Non-installation of speed limiting device (SLD) in vehicles is one of the major reasons for rise in road accidents in the state, International Road Safety expert and a member of National Road Safety Council Kamaljeet Soi said here on Tuesday.   Soi said as per the National Crime Records Bureau report released in 2015, altogether 9,555 road accidents took place in the state in 2014 alone, resulting in death of 5,421 persons. At least 6,835 persons were injured in these accidents.    “Of the total road fatalities in the country, a staggering 40-45% people die due to accidents caused by commercial vehicles. Overspeeding, drunk driving and violation of traffic rules are the primary reasons behind road fatalities in the country. Majority of highway deaths occur due to rash driving. SLDS in commercial vehicles can reduce road accidents by 20-25%,” he added.    Soi said the state transport department is openly violating the directive issued by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH). “The Centre had issued a notification on April 15, 2015, making it mandatory for all the states to install SLDs in commercial vehicles by January 31, 2017. The MoRTH issued another notification on May 1, 2017 making it mandatory for all vehicles having yellow number plate (except three-wheelers) to install SLD,” he said, adding despite several reminders, the state government has so far not implemented the guidelines.    “States like Karnataka, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Assam and Kerala have already fitted commercial vehicles with SLDs,” he added.
