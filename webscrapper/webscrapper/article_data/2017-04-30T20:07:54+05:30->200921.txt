We have formed a team to serve notices to the accused who reside in Delhi and Gurgaon,” senior superintendent of police (SSP)   told TOI.

Mohsin said that a police investigation into the case has found negligence on part of officials of Lansdowne forest division and a report has been sent to the forest department in this regard. 
 
 Earlier, a probe had found divisional forest officer (DFO) Mayank Shekhar Jha’s complicity in allowing the accused to camp deep inside the forest reserve in violation to the law. The DFO had then been suspended. He was, however, reinstated after a month as the state government said that it was found that Jha had not been involved in dereliction of duty.
 
 The accused in the case had remained in Pauri jail for over two weeks before being granted bail by the Uttarakhand high court on January 17.
