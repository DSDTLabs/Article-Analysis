PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: After a wait of eight years, the ambitious Empire Estate   at Kalewadi was finally inaugurated on Monday by district guardian minister Girish  . 

 After the inauguration of the flyover, Bapat told reporters that the new   police commissionerate will initially operate from a rented building until a permanent office is constructed. 
 
 Work on the flyover, the longest in Pimpri Chinchwad at 1.9km, had begun in 2010 and was supposed to finish in 2013. However, it skipped many deadlines and got delayed for five years. 
 
 However, the inauguration was not without its share of controversy. Activists from the Matang community, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and other organizations held a separate inauguration of the flyover before the official function, and named it after Lahuji Vastad Salve. 
 
 The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has named it the Mother Teresa flyover. 
 
 On the commissionerate, Bapat said, “We need 50-100 acres of land to set up the commissionerate. We also need land for setting up police chowkeys and stations. We are trying to acquire land on rent or through direct purchase.”
 
 Bapat further said a meeting will be held next week in this regard. 
 
 “There will be nine police stations from rural areas and five police stations from Pune that fall under the new commissionerate’s jurisdiction initially. We have identified two to three places for setting up a temporary office and will take it on rent or on lease for three to five years,” he said.
