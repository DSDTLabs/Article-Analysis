PANAJI: The capital city will be setting a model example by using briquettes made of agro-waste at the crematorium. To further this initiative, about 10-12 tonnes of these eco-friendly compressed bricks will be supplied at the Hindu crematorium at  , free of cost, by the   of Panaji. TOI had reported about the use of briquettes at the crematorium, in April.

 “One load (10-12 tonnes) of the briquettes will be provided by us. While the initial supply from us will be free, we are hopeful that the crematorium trust will continue with this practice by ordering the briquettes themselves,” said senior  .
 
 The use of this technology requires a special steel container costing about Rs 1.5 lakh, which the club has already procured and installed at the Panaji crematorium. Members of the club visited   to observe the use of briquette at the   crematorium and adopted the model in Goa soon after.
 
 “Two successful trial cremations were conducted at the crematorium in Panaji with due permission from the families of the deceased,”   said.
 
 The cremation cost is expected to come to less than Rs 1,500 with the use of these briquettes as opposed to Rs 3,000 using regular wood. The Rotarians informed that the project would help save up to Rs 5 lakh at the Panaji crematorium. The briquettes will be sourced from Belagavi.
 
 When compared with firewood, biomass briquettes are lighter and have less moisture content, greater calorific value and less ash content.
