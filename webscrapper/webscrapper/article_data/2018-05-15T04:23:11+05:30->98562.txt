MUMBAI: Corporators on Monday chose to stay mum in the   over the BMC’s proposal to award a   to  , alleged to be the new avatar of a firm blacklisted in the 2015  . Last week, they had raised a stink over the proposal.

 At Monday’s meeting, the Rs 7-crore proposal to transport south Mumbai’s garbage brought to the Mahalaxmi refuse transfer centre to the Deonar dumping ground via mini compactors was passed within minutes.
  
  
 Opposition party leader in the BMC Ravi Raja and NCP party leader Rakhi Jadhav raised questions on why did BJP corporators, who had so many reservations over the proposal last week, not say a word at the meeting. “The proposal was passed discreetly,” said Raja. 
 
 BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde, who had sought a reply on the issue on May 9, was not present at the meeting. He later told TOI, “Ideally, the proposal should not have been discussed when the corporator who had raised several queries over it was not present. My questions still remain, like when the existing contractor is already fighting a legal battle with the BMC, what measures have the civic administration taken in this regard.”
 
 BJP corporator  , who had also objected to the proposal last week and was present at Monday’s meeting, alleged that the Shiv Sena passed the proposal “surreptitiously”. “Almost at the end of the meeting, the proposal was passed without any discussion on the matter. The Shiv Sena clearly seems to be favouring the contractor,” said Narwekar.
 
 The civic administration had recently given Kaviraj MBB Waste Management the contract to transport garbage from the Gorai garbage transfer centre to Deonar, Mulund and Kanjurmarg dumping grounds. This time too, the firm was the lowest bidder, said officials from the civic solid waste management department.
