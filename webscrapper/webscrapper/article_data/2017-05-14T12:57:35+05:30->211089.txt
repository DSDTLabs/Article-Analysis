BHOPAL: Chief minister   met   at the latter’s official residence on Saturday morning and held a long discussion.

 When asked about the meeting, Speaker Sharma told reporters, “It was about strengthening the democratic system. It has always been my priority to see that credible work is done in the state assembly and legislators are satisfied with the replies from the government.”
 
 The meeting between the chief minister and Speaker were about dissatisfied MLAs and their continuous complaints in the assembly that officials do not give correct information about ground realities in answer to the questions asked. The meeting came directly before the chief minister’s meeting with principal secretaries of departments in the state secretariat. 
 
 During every session in the state assembly, MLAs have been alleging that government officials keep ministers in the dark and do not give correct answers to queries raised during the Question Hour. Former ministers of the erstwhile   government and senior MLAs like Mahendra Singh Kalukheda and Dr   have on record alleged that even when they write letters to bureaucrats, even a receipt and acknowledgement do not come.
 
 Last year, Speaker Sharma’s office had written to the state government and advised that letters of legislators should get replies from the administration. But MLAs continued to complain of bureaucratic indifference.
