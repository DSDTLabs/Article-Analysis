CHENNAI: A not-for-profit blood bank that has been serving the city for more than 20 years has announced it will shut down next month -not because of lack of donors, but because the cost of sustaining quality cannot be met.

 Jeevan Blood Bank, an in dependent facility with   (NABH) that opened in September 1995, said operations would cease on February 28, with the last blood donation on January 31.
 
 “Over the last three years, maintaining the highest level of blood safety and remaining financially sustainable has become impossible for Jeevan's blood bank operations,“ said founder chair man Dr   on his Facebook post. “Thank You, Chennai, for giving us an opportunity to serve you for 21 years,“ he said on January 1.Ironically, it was on this day in 1995 that they decided to start the blood bank.
 
 The city has more than 33 blood banks in the private sector, 10 in the government, two central government institutions and two belonging to the ESI. Many of them are attached to hospitals.
 
 Jeevan managers say the facility has been losing patronage as several smaller banks are providing blood components at nearly half the cost of Jeevan. Safety measures cost the bank at least Rs 2 lakh loss every month. “Most hospitals won't conduct drives to collect blood.They would ask patient's kin to replace blood. When this happens several people will pay the poor and ask them to donate. Safety may be compromised as a result,“ said former drugs controller M Bhaskaran.
 
 The bank, which has done over 1.5 lakh voluntary donations, became the first independent facility of its kind in South India to get NABH accreditation in 2010. Today, it is the only such blood bank in Chennai. Jeevan will continue its public cord blood bank funded by the Tamil Nadu government, the largest in the   region, and the bone marrow donor registry.
