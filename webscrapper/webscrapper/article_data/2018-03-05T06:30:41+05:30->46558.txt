SHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh government is yet to decide on whether it should refund the Rs 280-crore upfront premium paid by   for the 960MW Jangi Thopan hydropower project over the Satluj river in Kinnaur. 

 While power minister Anil Sharma recently hinted at not returning the money, chief minister   said on Sunday that they would seek legal opinion, and study rules, before taking any decision.
 
 The previous Congress government, in a cabinet meeting in 2015, decided to refund the money. But, later, it took a U-turn. Now, the BJP regime too is is undecided. After the saffron party came to power, Sharma had hinted at the government not returning the money. “I have not seen the file so far, but a decision will be taken after taking legal opinion and studying all rules and regulations regarding the allotment procedures of the project,” the CM said on Sunday.
 
 When the Congress was in power, the Himachal Pradesh cabinet of ministers, in September 2015, decided to refund the upfront premium of Rs 280 crore. In October last year, though, the cabinet decided to find options available to it for returning the money. However, right before the assembly elections, the Congress decided against the refund.
 
 Jangi-Thopan (480MW) and Thopan-Powari (480MW) hydel projects was actually allotted   but the Rs 280 upfront premium was paid by Adani in lieu of getting partner status in the project. Sources said the premium was paid in two installments to the government, between 2008 and 2010. After allotment of project ran into rough weather following legal dispute, the state cabinet, in July 2013, decided to have another auction for allotting the projects.
