SALIGAO: Students of Our Lady of Divar High School, Divar, recently visited the solid waste management plant at Saligao. The engineers at the plant showed the students how the garbage, that is brought in from across the state, is processed. 

 
 The students were also shown how dry waste is segregated into 12 different categories including plastic, glass and metal. The students were also given first-hand information on the working of the plant.
