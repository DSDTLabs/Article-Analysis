 "I'm still apologising to people now... The way Matthew went was out of my hands - but it was rather shocking. There were some very upset people and I've had to apologise to a lot of people over the past four years," says Stevens. 
 
 The "Beauty and the Beast" actor continues people will eventually understand his decision of leaving the show and will watch out for his other works. 
 
 Stevens says, "I've done a lot since then though - so hopefully people are seeing what I have been up to and are beginning to understand why I wanted to move on.
