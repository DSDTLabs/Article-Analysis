Music director   is known for his melodious tunes, especially, soft romantic numbers. While he has made the rare exception, like, for instance, the 80s pop numberesque Current Hoda Timealli from Love in Mandya for which he got Bappi Lahiri to sing, Anoop has never really given in to commercial film demands to compose a pucca  .

The song, he said, will be released online through his banner, with an accompanying lyrical video on February 18
