Madhavi and Bhinde are busy talking to each other and reminiscing their past days when they got married and their first Holi together. Just as they start applying colours on each other, their daughter Sonu enters and asks them what they have been upto along with the other kids of the society.
 
  The kids pass taunts to Bhide as he had asked them not to play with colours and was doing the same himself. Madhvi tells the kids that Bhide smeared her face with colours first, and then she retaliated by doing the same. Tapu tells Bhide to come to the society compound by 7 pm as they will be celebrating Holika Dahan, Bhide gives him a stern look.
  
  Daya serves tea to Champaklal, who asks her how she manages to take care of the entire house on her own. Her answer makes the latter feel nice. He says he is lucky to have her as his daughter-in-law. He asks her to call Jethalal and tell him to come back early from work for Holika dahan.
  
  
 
  
  Jethalal is happy seeing a man come out of his shop as he thinks that he might have purchased something, but he is shocked to hear that the man had gone in for a free drink. He goes inside and shouts at Bagga and Nattu Kaka.
  
  A customer walks in and asks for a 42 inch TV, when he is served thandai, he asks for a 50 inch TV. Jethalal is surprised with the response that he is getting in return of thandai, until when the customer refuses to buy it and leaves the shop. Jethalal asks Nattu kaka to not offer free thandai until the customer buys something from their shop.
