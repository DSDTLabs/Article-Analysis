LUDHIANA: On a day when Ludhiana (rural) police arrested three accused and “unearthed the mystery” behind the murder of 22-year-old   Singh of Dheraka village in  , his family members stuck to the stand and refused to cremate his body, saying that they would demand a   probe into the matter.

 The family and villagers held a press conference at Police Lines, denouncing the police version in the case. 
 
 Gurpreet’s family members — his grandmother Gurdayal Kaur (who had kept her grandson’s body parts locked in a wooden box), grandfather Jagir Singh and father   — said the police claimed Gurpreet had gone to Patiala to get Rs 2,500 from a girl, but is it believable that an owner of 14 acres of land needs to leave home at 5am for such a paltry amount in an illegal manner? They added the police had claimed Gurpreet had raped two girls, but why is it that not even a single girl had registered a case against him.
 
 The deceased’s kin said the accused arrested by the police were labourers, but they suspected the role of some big fish in the murder. They said, “Why did the Ludhiana police fail to find weapons while Ludhiana (rural) police managed to trace them. They added the police had claimed four persons were riding on a single bike, but have not produced any footage to substantiate the claims. They wondered why the cops who said Gurpreet had nude pictures of girls in his mobile phones are not revealing the pictures despite having both his phones in the possession.”
