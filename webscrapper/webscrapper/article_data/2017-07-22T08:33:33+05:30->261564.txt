HYDERABAD: Orthopaedic and spine surgeons in the city report an alarming rise in spinal injuries and back aches among commuters in the city. The reason--travelling for long hours on pothole-ridden, uneven roads, some of which include the Balanagar national highway, the Uppal to Nacharam stretch and SD road in Begumpet.

 “It is mostly the lower back that is affected. If no remedial measures are taken, number of patients suffering from such health complications at an young age will only go up,“ warned Dr  , consultant spine surgeon at KIMS hospitals in Secunderabad.
 
 From lower back pains to a complicated herniated disc injury to the spine, bad city roads have become a growing cause for spine-related injuries among commuters and especially among office-goers, say doctors.
 
 “On an average 15 to 20 people come to us on a daily basis.The pothole-ridden roads that people are travelling on are causing problems like slip discs, back pains, particularly among the office-goers. If not treated on time, these may lead to severe problems like spondylosis, which is usually associated only with age-related wear and tear of the spinal discs. Earlier, only people above 50 years were seen developing such injuries, many in their 20s are also being diagnosed with spinal injuries now,“ said Dr  , consultant spine surgeon at   in Madhapur.
 
 Doctors pointed out how the sedentary lifestyle, led by many people who have desk jobs, is also to blame for the back problems.
 
 “A large number of IT professionals today are seen complaining of spinal injuries. In addition to bad roads, it's also their sedentary lifestyles that are to be blamed for it. The lack of regular exercises can often make the situation worse,“ said Dr  , senior orthopaedic surgeon at Yashoda Hospitals.
 
 Doctors now recommend regular back exercises and posture correction using ergonomics, as precautionary measures to overcome the backache problem.
