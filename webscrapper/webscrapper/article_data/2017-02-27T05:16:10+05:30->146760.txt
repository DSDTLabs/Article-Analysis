 Nautiyal, who is basking in the success of recent hits, 'Kisi Se Pyar Ho Jaye' from   and ' ' from OK  , was in for a rude shock when his new single, 'Haaye Dil', was leaked online ahead of its February 12 launch. Jubin says he will be filing a police complaint as it took him two years to get a release for the song.

 'We had shot an expensive video after getting 22 permissions for a rock concert sequence at the India Gate. I feel so helpless right now. T-series wants to get done with the paperwork regarding the leak first because of which the release is delayed,' the singer told Mirror.
 
 Jubin figured this was the right time to release the single as his songs had started getting popular. 'We worked at multiple studios to create this track with professionals. I trust the studios I work with. Maybe it got hacked and leaked. Hopefully the police will nail the culprit so other singers don't suffer,' he says.
