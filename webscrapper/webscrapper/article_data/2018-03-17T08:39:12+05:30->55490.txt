HYDERABAD: Making a distinction between a   during Governor’s address and a House during conduct of its regular business, expelled T Congress legislators Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and A   on Friday told the Hyderabad HC that the Assembly Speaker does not possess powers to act as a presiding officer of the House during a Governor’s address. They were challenging their expulsions. Justice B   was hearing them through their counsel Ravi Shankar Jandhyala.

 These rules can be invoked and members can be acted against only when proceedings of the House are on and the ‘business’ of the House is disrupted, the counsel said. He said that the   had held that the address of governor is not ‘business’ of House. He wondered how the action was initiated invoking business rules when the governor was addressing a joint session of both houses and none of the presiding officers of these Houses were on the chair.
 
 Speaking about the alleged injury to the chairman of the Legislative Council, Jandhyala raised doubts about the injury itself because the chairman was seen with a ‘bandage to the right eye’. Throwing a headphone is the charge against one legislator and there has been no reason assigned till now for the expulsion of the other, he said. Copies of expulsion have not been served so far, he said. Citing an SC judgment that principles of natural justice should be followed even in the House, the counsel told the court that none of them were given notice, nor their version heard. The concept of expulsion is not there in the Constitution, he said.
 
 Telangana Advocate General (AG) D Prakash Reddy sought time to argue his case. The judge then posted the case to Monday.
