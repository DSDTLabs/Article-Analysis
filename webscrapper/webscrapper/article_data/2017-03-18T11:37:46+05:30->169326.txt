Newly-elected Punjab Minister   on Friday vowed to continue his weekly appearance on the comedy show,  .
 
  The minister has stated that he will fly down to Mumbai every Saturday, shoot for the show and then fly back to Punjab on Sundays.
  
  “Listen to me. People made me win five times in the past 12 years and no one had an objection. If they had no objection, what's tickling you? If my constituency and my people have no objection, what's tickling you?” Sidhu asked a reporter who questioned him about this.
  
  
 
  
  Meanwhile, senior advocate and nominated Rajya Sabha MP,  , has hit out at Sidhu stating that Sidhu cannot compromise the post of a minister and he will have to choose between his ministerial post and the show.
  
  “Being a minister is a whole time job and there is no question of doing any other assignment. Even as lawyers we stop practice the moment you take over as a minister. Therefore, there is no question - either he will have to resign as a minister if he wants to continue the show or he will have to discontinue the show,” said KTS Tulsi, speaking to TIMES NOW.
