PUNE:   ( )’s Puja Kodre has retained the   seat in the   held at Mundhwa- Magarpatta City panel on Friday.

 The election was necessitated due to the death of former mayor Chanchala Kodre. The   (BJP), which has a decisive majority in PMC with 100-odd corporators, decided to fight the election in full strength to avoid an unopposed win for NCP.
 
 The result, however, went against BJP’s expectations as party’s candidate Sukayna Gaikwad was able to secure third place behind Shiv Sena’s Monika Tupe.
 
 NCP’s leader in  , who also represents the same constituency, said that win in bypolls was an outcome of people’s anger against BJP’s rule in the state and Centre. “There has been lot of discontent among people about BJP’s style of functioning and non-performance. The party has not delivered on promises and has only sold dreams to people. Similar outcomes will continue in the forthcoming elections,” he said.
 
 BJP local leaders, however, refuted charges levelled by NCP and said that the defeat would not make any difference to ongoing developmental work in the city. “BJP came to power in PMC last year. In one year, many major projects have moved ahead. Some of these projects are in Mundhwa area. The bypoll results cannot be seen as a reflection of people’s sentiment. The party will continue to carry out developmental work in the city,” a senior leader from the party said.
 
 Mundhwa-Magarpatta city area is known to be dominated by NCP. Political sources in PMC said that BJP attempted to break NCP’s dominance. Despite active role of guardian minister Girish Bapat and other senior party leaders in the bypoll campaign, the result went against the BJP, they said.
 
 Kodre secured 8,998 votes, Tupe 5,470 while Gaikwad was able to garner 4,334 votes. Voting was held on Friday. About 35% voting was recorded.
