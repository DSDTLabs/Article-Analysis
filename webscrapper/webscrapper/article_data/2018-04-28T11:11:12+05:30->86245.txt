LUCKNOW: Bringing the   to life by wearing a 'zebra suit', young volunteers with placards and banners promoted the message of road safety at   crossing. 

 They told commuters about the importance of zebra crossings and traffic lights. The campaign was organised by   as part of the ongoing road safety awareness week. Traffic officials said over 2 lakh vehicles pass through Hazratganj crossing everyday. 
 
 During the campaign, as the traffic light turned red, signalling commuters to stop, the majority of commuters stopped their vehicles right on the zebra crossing, leaving no space for pedestrians to cross. 
 
 Volunteers from the Foundation walked to these drivers with banners and asked them to move back. With placards saying 'stop' they told them about the zebra crossing's importance and distributed pamphlets of traffic rules. The campaign will continue till Saturday, said the founder of the foundation Shubham Soti.
