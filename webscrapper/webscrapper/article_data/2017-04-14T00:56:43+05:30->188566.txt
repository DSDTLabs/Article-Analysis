NEW DELHI: A   of vehicle lifters had a unique modus operandi. They would steal a vehicle and buy another damaged in accident as scrap. 

 They would replace the numberplate, chassis and engine numbers of the stolen vehicle with those obtained from the other. Then they would sell it off to an unsuspecting customer. 
 
 Police   the gang and arrested three men identified as Alok Shrivastava (47),   (30) and Javed (34). Eight cars ranging from Swift Dzire to Fortuner have been seized. 
 
 During interrogation, the men said they got the car from one Nawab and were on their way to sell it off on his instructions. They also said that Nawab was the kingpin. He used to procure documents of cars damaged in accidents from his contacts in insurance companies. 
 
 He would buy those   on valid papers, and after superimposing their numbers on the stolen cars, used to sell them off on those papers. This helped him to avoid detection. 
 
 The gang sold around 25 vehicles in this way.
