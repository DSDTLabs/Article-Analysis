NEW DELHI: The student and teacher unions of   staged a protest against the reconstitution of Gender Sensitisation Committee Against Sexual Harassment ( ) into the   (ICC). 

 At present, GSCASH comprises elected members. But ICC will have two teachers nominated by the vice-chancellor and three elected student representatives. The students have raised doubts on whether ICC, with its nominated members, will be on a par with GSCASH, known for its gender-neutral nature and strong redressal framework.
 
 The student union claimed the   administration deliberately notified a stay on the election of representatives for GSCASH a day after the JNUSU poll results were declared, even though committees for review of the body were created well in advance. Geeta Kumari, the president of JNU Students’ Union and a former student representative in GSCASH, alleged that the administration never stopped the staff election — in which centres elect staff representatives to GSCASH — but decided to put student representative elections on hold. “They knew that with a new JNUSU, new student representatives to GSCASH would also have to be elected and so they notified a stay immediately,” she said. Kumari resigned from her post in GSCASH after she became the JNUSU president.
 
 Students and teachers claimed the administration was bent on destroying the autonomous character of the gender sensitisation body and had also removed all recommendations made by review committee member K B Usha. “The review body mostly had men, with no expertise. The one member who had credible experience had to resign,” said Kumari.
 
 In a statement, the teachers’ union alleged that Usha’s recommendations were also ignored by the review panel, following which she resigned. The recommendations on forming ICC are going to be placed in front of the Executive Council on Monday.
