NEW DELHI: Police officers disguised themselves as hawkers to recover the   phone of   ambassador Igor Polikha, which was snatched when he was clicking a selfie in front of Red Fort on Thursday.

 Police sources said a sketch was prepared on inputs given to them by the ambassador. The sketch was then circulated in the nearby areas. Anyone with a matching description was questioned.   ultimately got a tip-off from a priest, who directed them to the accused’s hideout. A team of policemen then, disguised as hawkers, nabbed the accused before he could flee.
 
 DCP (north) Jatin Narwal said that the accused,  , was arrested and the phone was recovered from his residence.
 
 The ambassador told cops that Prasad had approached him and requested for a selfie with him. Polikha obliged and as he was adjusting his phone, the accused snatched it from him and fled.
 
 Police sources said that more than 100 people were questioned regarding the incident to extract any available information. They finally got a breakthrough when a 12-year-old boy told them that he knew a person in Yamuna Bazar who looked similar to the sketch.
 
 A priest in the area found the sketch matching to a person who lived nearby and had been involved in snatching cases previously. Following the tip-off, the police team raided Prasad’s residence and   him.
 
 Prasad told cops that he intended to buy drugs from the money he would have gotten after selling the phone.
