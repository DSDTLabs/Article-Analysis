MUMBAI: After a clarification was issued by the   of health and family welfare on Thursday, the state government has decided to take control of 100% seats in all postgraduate   this year. Since a few states exempted management and   quota seats in deemed and private colleges from the centralized counselling process, institutes in the state too sought an exemption.

 However, with the central government clarifying its stand on Thursday, the state has decided to comply with its rules, much to the relief of aspirants. Deemed institutes in the state have 925 seats in postgraduate courses, while private institutes have around 350.
 
 Early this year, the state government had decided to fill 50% of the seats in PG courses across private and deemed institutions.The remaining seats under the institutional quota were to be filled by the management. The union ministry, however, asked the state to fill all the seats in a circular issued in March.
 
 “The state was to decide after ameeting with the management of deemed and private institutes. But with this notification from the Centre, the state will have to follow the rule,“ said director of directorate of medical education and research, Pravin Shingare.
