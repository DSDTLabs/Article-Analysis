MADURAI: Refusing to order a   probe into a   committed by  , owner of Delhi-based HBN Dairies and Allied Limited, the Madras high court Madurai bench on Monday ordered the superintendent of prison, central prison in Raipur in  , not to release him, even if he has been granted bail by the courts in other states. 

 The court also ordered the superintendent of prison to produce Sran before the special court for the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 1997, in Madurai. 
 
 “On such production, it is open to the Tamil Nadu state police to intervene and take further proceedings in the three pending cases against him,” said justice   who heard a batch of three cases filed by 10 depositors. 
 
 The petitioners said that the state police had not properly investigated the case, but the judge said, “The status report filed by the police shows that the investigation has been going on in the right direction and that they were not able to secure Amandeep Singh Sran for identifying the properties in his name for the purpose of attachment. Thus, this is not a fit case to order transfer of investigation to CBI at this stage.”
 
 The judge also said the petitioners could approach the court once again for transferring the cases to CBI. “It is always open to the petitioners to approach this court once again for transferring the case to CBI, if after securing Sran, the state police fail to conduct the investigation in a proper manner.”
