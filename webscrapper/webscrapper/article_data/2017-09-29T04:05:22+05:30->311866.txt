NEW DELHI:   MP   on Thursday came out in support of his party colleague   over the latter’s criticism of the economy, saying he was a true statesman and had shown the government the mirror.

 The   MP, who has been at odds with BJP’s official positions, also targeted party leaders for dismissing the former finance minister’s views, saying it would be “childish” to do so as they were “entirely in the party’s and national interest”.
 
 Taking a dig at the party in a series of tweets, Shatrughan claimed motives were being ascribed to Yashwant Sinha’s observations and “we all know that the infamous and pervasive dirty tricks department” was behind them.
 
 The actor-turned-politician quoted  , saying the PM had recently reiterated that the nation was bigger than the party and national interest came first. “I’m of the firm opinion that everything that has been written by Mr Sinha is entirely in the party’s and national interest,” he tweeted.
 
 “He (Yashwant) is a true statesman and a tried and tested man of wisdom, who has proven himself as one of the most successful finance ministers of the country. He has shown the mirror on the economic condition of India and has hit the nail right on the head,” Shatrughan said. Describing Yashwant Sinha as an elder brother Shatrughan said the party veteran must be applauded for coming out with these views.
 
 In his tweets, the MP also praised Arun Shourie, another member of the Vajpayee cabinet who, like Yashwant Sinha, has turned into a strong critic of the Modi government's policies.
 
 “Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie are extremely learned and experienced intellectuals. Neither has any expectation or interest in getting a post (or ministership), especially with the next elections less than two years away,” Shatrughan tweeted.
