MUMBAI: The transport department has confiscated 595   and   in the past two months for evading the state   to the tune of approximately Rs 10 crore.

 Interestingly, after the drive gained momentum in February and 400 cars were seized till then, several car owners were willing to pay the tax and penalty. “These owners were afraid that we may intercept their cars on roads and it may cause them embarrassment, which is why they came to us and showed willingness to abide by the law,” said regional transport officer Govind Saindane.
 
 “We welcome citizens to approach the local   and pay taxes for vehicles which have been registered outside Maharashtra,” said Saindane. 
 
 The drive was launched by deputy transport commissioner Pradeep Shinde under the supervision of transport commissioner Praveen Gedam, and so far, it has resulted in recovery of taxes to the tune of Rs 5.5 crore. “We are yet to recover the balance tax amount and some of the cars remain confiscated with us,” said a transport official. 
 
 Most vehicles seized by RTO had registration numberplates of Daman & Diu, Pondicherry and Jharkhand,where vehicles attract a very low tax.
