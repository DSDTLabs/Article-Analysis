GURUGRAM: Parents of students in  , Sector 4, finally heaved a sigh of relief after the fee and fund regulatory committee (FFRC), headed by Gurgaon divisional commissioner D Suresh, ruled that the   and other miscellaneous charges imposed on parents by the school, were invalid.

 Parents were elated. The decision comes after four months of bitter feud between the school and the parents, over the issue of ‘arbitrary imposition’ of capitation fee and fee hike. 
 
 Suresh, who spoke to TOI, said he had taken the decision only after a report of an audit conducted in July had revealed the school had submitted Form VI after the December 31 deadline last year. “I told the school I’ll have to function within legal parameters, so the fee hike won’t be allowed since they had failed to submit Form VI on time.”
 
 As many as 150 parents of Blue Bells Model School gathered outside the office of D Suresh on Monday morning. 
 
 “The meeting took place at 11am. It was attended by parents of children in Blue Bells Model School,” said Rajdeep Kaur, a parent. “FFRC chairman’s order means the school will now have to refund the entire fee, which it had charged unlawfully, or adjust it with fees for the next quarter.”
 
 TOI also spoke to Suman Gulati, director, Blue Bells School. She said, “D Suresh only disallowed the fee hike because we were late in filing Form VI, that too only by a day. It was not our mistake. The deadline was on a weekend so we went the following day, but the concerned person wasn’t there.” 
 
 Gulati claimed D Suresh had told her the fee hike was within permissible limits. “Our hike is only 9.8%,” said Gulati.
