HYDERABAD:   in Telangana may soon have reason to rejoice. For, they will get the   till they drop well into the wee hours of the day, if the proposed draft ' ' is anything to go by. 

 The Telangana government is planning to allow retail outlets, shopping malls and big establishments in the state to function from 5 am to 2 am the next day, boosting Telangana and more particularly Hyderabad's image as a vibrant and cosmopolitan metro. This means all retail outlets and malls in the state will have to down their shutters only for three hours in a day-- from 2 am to 5 am.
 
 The policy is also slated to offer more power to women employees by allowing them to work beyond 10 pm, but only if the women staffers do not have any objections and employers ensure safe transport to those working late shifts.
 
 Industries minister   had recently announced that the state will be coming up with a retail trade policy that will make sweeping changes with regard to working hours, shifts and employment under the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act.
