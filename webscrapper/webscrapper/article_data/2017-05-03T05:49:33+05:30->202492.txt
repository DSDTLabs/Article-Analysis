BENGALURU: Cab aggregators want the maximum fare to be increased to Rs 28/km. They reportedly expressed this at a meeting with the state transport department last week. At present, the state has capped maximum fare at Rs 19.5/km.

 The aggregators — Uber and Ola — are learnt to have told the department that they cannot have uniform pricing for all categories of cars, particularly luxury vehicles. However, both companies chose not to comment on the issue. 
 
 The transport department has constituted a committee to study the feasibility of increasing the rate. B Dayananda, transport commissioner told TOI: “The committee has been set up to look into the confusion related to cab fares. It’ll submit a report to the government soon. The authorities will then have to decide whether to increase the rate or keep it unchanged.”
 
 The committee has three joint commissioner-rank officials and non-government members, including  , secretary of  , and a few driver union members. Holla said, “The tariff structure followed by the aggregators has always been a grey area even for the department. Increasing the maximum fare will not only be a burden on commuters, but also give the companies more room for dynamic pricing. This will make fares less transparent for commuters.”
 
 Sources in the transport department, however, say the committee is unlikely to increase the maximum fare at Rs 28/km. “Rules for economy cab services are clear. Cabs having engine capacity of less than 2200cc will fall under the city cab services and have to follow the maximum fare as prescribed by the state transport authority. But cars like Innova having an engine capacity of over 2500cc do not come under city cab services. However, aggregators have started hiring such cabs, leading to confusion,” said an official.
 
 Ola and Uber drivers’ association also seem to be against any further increase in maximum fare. Tanveer Pasha, who has been spearheading the anti-aggregator movement, said this will only dilute the business for drivers. “If cab fares are increased to Rs 28/km, there’ll be a decrease in demand and this will affect our daily earnings. As it is, the incentives are a tough target to achieve,” he pointed out.
 
 Holla also explained that even if the maximum fare is increased, the companies will continue to market their services at Rs 6 or Rs 7/km and during peak hours the surge price will touch the Rs 28/km mark, something that’s already happening now. “If you see the surged fares during rainy evenings, you’ll know that they are 60 to 70% higher than the rate of the services they offer. Sometimes, it’s even double the total fare you would have paid during non-peak hours. These are business strategies which are going to hurt drivers and commuters in future,” he said
 
 POINTS TO BE NOTED
 
 Holla has also written to the commissioner saying that in order to fix the minimum and maximum fares for aggregator model of taxi operators, the following points need to be considered: 
 
 * Cost, durability and depreciation of vehicle
 
  * Salary of driver
 
 * Road tax, permit fees, toll charges
 
 *   of vehicle
 
 * Fuel charges
 
 * Service and maintenance charges
 
  * Bank interest charges
 
  * Traffic density (time taken to a travel a km during peak and non-peak hours in city)
 
 * National legal metrology-approved meter device in vehicles
