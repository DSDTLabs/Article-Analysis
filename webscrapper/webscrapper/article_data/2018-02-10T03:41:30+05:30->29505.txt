NEW DELHI: The   will get to place additional evidence against Indian Mujahideen terrorist   to nail his role in killing decorated officer MC Sharma in the   encounter case. But not before it pays Rs 50,000 to the convicted terrorist as cost. 

 In the interest of justice the   on Friday allowed the prosecution to record additional evidence relating to forensic report of Ahmed’s alleged voice samples to establish his presence inside the   flat raided by police in 2008. 
 
 However, a bench of justices S Muralidhar and I S Mehta also took into account that Ahmed has been in jail for past eight years and now faces a delay on his appeal, which was nearing a conclusion before the police filed an application to place additional evidence. 
 
 “The state will pay the appellant costs of Rs 50,000 in this application not later than two weeks from today. 
 
 The proof of payment of costs shall be produced before the trial Court on the date fixed by this court for appearance of the parties,” the bench directed while laying down strict time lines for recording of evidence in Saket court. 
 
 Nearly five years after Ahmed appealed in the high court against his conviction, the prosecution had last month sought permission to bring in additional evidence to bolster its case. 
 
 While allowing the plea HC made it clear that the prosecution won’t seek any adjournment and will be ready with its witnesses for being examined on a day-to-day basis before the trial court. 
 
 Next, HC said that the convict’s statement on the additional evidence must be recorded within one week and asked both the prosecution and defence to cooperate in the proceedings before the trial court. It directed the trial court to place before it by April 30, the “entire transcript” of the recording of additional evidence that relates to forensic report of Ahmed’s alleged voice samples.
