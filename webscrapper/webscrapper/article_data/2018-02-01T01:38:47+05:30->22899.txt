NEW DELHI: Had a teacher not seen   (name changed) getting   in his classroom in a government school in Uttam Nagar, his   by four of his schoolmates for the past two years would have never come to the fore.

 The 13-year-old boy shared his ordeal with TOI saying that it almost drove him to commit suicide. He said that the harassment started when he was in the same section with the accused in Class VIII. “They would scare me with blades and ask me to keep my mouth shut or they would kill me. They would continue to assault me even when I complained of pain,” the boy said.
 
 The accused would ensure that Shivam remained in constant fear by harassing him on his way home from school. For close to two years, the accused would bully Shivam inside the school, wait for him outside the school gates in the afternoon and then drag him to the park near the school to sodomise him.
 
 The boy’s family observed his behaviour changing as he became reclusive. “He would not step out of the house and stopped playing with other children. He would give excuses for not going to school saying that he had already studied the lesson at the tuition centre,” the boy’s grandmother said. He also underwent a check-up by a local doctor for loss of appetite, but no one could figure out what was bothering him.
 
 On Tuesday, when the teacher took him to the staff room, the boy started crying. He asked the teacher to accompany him home otherwise the accused boys would do “bad things” with him in the park. After Shivam narrated his ordeal, a teacher escorted him to his house and told his mother to keep him home for a few days.
 
 “The teacher didn’t give us a reason and just asked us to send Shivam’s father to the school,” the boy’s uncle said. Subsequently, police were called and three of the four accused were apprehended.
