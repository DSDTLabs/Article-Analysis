Stars of the hit show   are releasing their second book on 5th September this year.

 Their first book, ‘Dream Home: The Property Brothers Ultimate Guide to Finding & Fixing Your Perfect House’, was a New York Times bestseller. It, “really educated people on our process when it comes to real estate, buying, selling and renovating”, according to Drew.
 
 Their current book, ‘It Takes Two: Our Story’, is a memoir of their “entreprenerd” journey, as Drew phases it to PEOPLE, “This is about our lives. This is where we started.”
 
 One tale the brothers shared was about some of their first forays into entrepreneurship, at the tender age of 7, when they started making and selling fabric-covered wire hangers. They worked as clowns for birthday parties and private events. “They were making $20 an hour and they were like 10 years old,” their mother, Joanne, told PEOPLE
 
 Now they have had several popular TV shows, a line of home decor and furniture, their own production company, Scott Entertainment, their first book,   and their soon to be released second book.
 
 “This is showing people what our life lessons were as we grew up, how we were raised,” says Drew.
