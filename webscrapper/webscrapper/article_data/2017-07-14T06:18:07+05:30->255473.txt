 An analysis of the latest accident data available with the Cyberabad traffic cops shows that 1,478 accidents were recorded within Cyberabad limits in the first five months of this year alone, while the figure for 2016 stood at 1,009. While 269 accidents were recorded in the region in April this year, the number shot up to 341 in May.

 "Around 70% of road accidents in the city are caused due to the driver's fault. Hence, traffic awareness programmes must be conducted and this must start right from colleges. Another major cause is faulty road infrastructure. GHMC must immediately start work on rectifying the black spots and blind turns along the city roads," he added.
