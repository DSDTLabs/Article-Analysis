NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday boycotted the meeting of the   selection committee and called it the Modi government’s eyewash to satisfy the   over non-appointment of the anti-corruption watchdog in four years. 

 Congress leader in   Mallikarjun   said not only had the government not appointed Lokpal but had also not passed the bill which would put the ‘leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha” in the Lokpal selection committee as required by the statute. 
 
 Since Lok Sabha does not have a ‘leader of opposition’, the term has to be replaced with ‘leader of largest opposition party in LS’ in the Lokpal bill. The said amendment bill is pending in Parliament. Kharge’s boycott came after Congress decided to up the ante on corruption, eager to press its campaign against the Centre over bank scams. 
 
 He said the inaction on Lokpal front proved that the Modi government’s claim of fighting graft was hollow. In a protest letter to PM Modi, Kharge objected to being called as a “special invitee”, arguing that the “sacred procedure” had been reduced to a “political pretence”. He termed the invitation as an effort to exclude the opposition from the selection process. 
 
 The meeting on Thursday was called to choose an eminent jurist to the panel which will select the Lokpal. “In these circumstances, I must respectfully decline the invite as special invitee to uphold the inviolability of the Lokpal Act, 2013, as the current proceedings have reduced a sacred procedure to a political pretence,” he said. 
 
 Kharge wondered why the Centre could not amend the bill to replace ‘leader of opposition’ with ‘leader of largest opposition party’ for Lokpal when it had done so in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Bill, 2014. “This amending bill continues to languish in cold storage for want of appropriate intent, commitment and objectivity on the part of the government,” he alleged.
