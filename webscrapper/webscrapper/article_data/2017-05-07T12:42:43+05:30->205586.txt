NEW DELHI: "Massive expose on   tomorrow" tweeted AAP's   Kapil Mishra on a day he was stripped of his job as minister by   

  
 
 
 
 Mishra told TOI he had not been informed officially about his removal from the cabinet. "I will not go and talk to him now, he will have to talk to me," Mishra said when asked if he will meet Kejriwal and ask him the reason for 
  . Asked whether he was planning to quit AAP, he said, "No, this is my party." 
 
 In his letter to the ACB chief, M K Meena, Mishra has said that since the tanker scam was being investigated on the basis of a fact-finding report submitted by him, he felt it was important to find out the status of the case and also share new evidence he had in the matter. He also urged Meena to investigate four more cases linked to the tenure of Dikshit pertaining to DJB at the earliest. 
 
  Mishra was brought in as minister after Jitender Singh 
  and his arrest in the case. That was June 2015 and he was given charge of law along with other departments. Later as the Centre-state tussle grew, the department was taken away from him and given to deputy CM Manish Sisodia. Mishra was one of the most vocal ministers on policy decisions and good at putting across the party view. 
 
 When he was inducted as a minister, he was known to be a Kejriwal loyalist. He has been associated with him since the IAC days. This trust was evident for Mishra as he was made a minister despite the fact that his mother, Annapurna Mishra, was a well-known face in Delhi BJP.
