NEW DELHI: From next month, real-time emission details of vehicles in Delhi will be available   to keep track of the polluting ones. This will be extended to three other constituent states in the National Capital Region, Uttar Pradesh , Rajasthan and Haryana, from October 1.

 The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification to roll this out to help take quick action against polluting vehicles. As per the notification, details of the emission test results of all in-use vehicles will be uploaded electronically to the state or central register of vehicles. The government has set up a central depository called Vahan to store   relating to all vehicles. 
 
 Sources said as soon as the pollution test of any   is carried out the detailed data of emission of each vehicle will be linked to the state and central register. “The objective is to have real time tracking of vehicle pollution. This will strengthen the system and loopholes in the present system can be plugged,” said joint secretary (transport) Abhay Damle.
 
 The ministry has set the time line for all-India roll out from   2019.
 
 TOI in August 2017 had first reported the central government move to launch this initiative. The transport ministry had called a meeting of the transport commissioners of the four states of NCR, officials of petroleum ministry, manufacturers of the pollution testing machines and the fuel marketing companies for standardisation of the output of the pollution test.
 
 The Supreme Court had earlier directed that insurance of a vehicle should not be renewed unless the owner provides pollution under control (PUC) certificate.
