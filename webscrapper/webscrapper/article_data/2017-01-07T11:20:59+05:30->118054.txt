AHMEDABAD: A 16-year-old student of  , hanged herself at her home in Nava Vadaj. Vadaj police are investigating the case and said that they suspect her ill health was the reason for her killing herself. Police are yet to speak to her friends and teachers to ascertain whether a disproportionate fear of exams had a role.

 According to Vadaj police, the family members of Nirali Parmar, 16, a resident of Vishramnagar, found her hanging from a ceiling fan by a bedsheet at 12.30pm on Friday. She had locked the bedroom and had hanged herself. Police did not find a note from the spot.
 
 As the police were busy with Vibrant Gujarat bandobast, and did not record primary statements in the case, sources said Nirali had not been keeping well for several months and it had affected her studies. Her father works for a private organization. As she was to take a board examination this year, police suspect these two factors might have disturbed her.
 
 The last year saw eight suicides by board students — one of the highest in recent years — in the run-up to the exams in March. A number of initiatives were taken by educational institutes, GSEB and NGOs, to counsel students and assuring them so they do not lose hope.
