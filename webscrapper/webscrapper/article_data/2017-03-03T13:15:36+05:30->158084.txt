PANAJI: Kolhapur police recently questioned Sanatan Sanstha founder   at Sanatan Ashram in Ramnathi, Ponda, in connection with communist leader  

 Athavale stopped making public appearances at the   since 2004. 
 
 “We have questioned Athavale for nearly two hours,” said additional superintendent of police (ASP), Kolhapur, Suhail Sharma, who is the investigation officer in the case. But, the ASP refused to divulge the questions posed to Athavale.
 
 The team from Kolhapur had arrived in Goa around 4pm on Tuesday and questioned Athavale to find out whether he knew anything about Pansare’s murder. They also questioned Virendra Marathe -- the Sanstha’s managing trustee -- and three other sadhaks, before leaving on Wednesday.
 
 “The police asked when I had joined Sanatan Sanstha, what is its organisational structure, how it functions and other such general questions,” Marathe told TOI, adding that Athavale had told the police that he did not know anything about Pansare’s murder.
 
 On February 16, 2015, unidentified men riding on a motorcycle approached Pansare near his residence in Kolhapur and shot him when he was returning from a morning walk with his wife. Both were injured in the incident and were immediately admitted at a private hospital. Pansare succumbed to his injuries on February 20.
 
 On September 16, 2015, Kolhapur police had arrested Sameer Gaikwad -- a Sanatan Sanstha sadhak -- from his residence in Sangli for his alleged involvement in the murder. They also arrested Virendrasinh Tawade and made him the second suspect in the case.
 
 The Sanatan Sanstha has over 50,000 sadhaks in Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra who travel to Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and other places to spread spirituality and the goals and objectives of the organization.
