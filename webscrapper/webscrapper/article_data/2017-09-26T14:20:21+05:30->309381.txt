AGRA: In a dramatic turn of events, a man accused of texting death threats to   BJP MLA Manish Asija jumped out of a police van and escaped while being taken for medical examination on Monday morning.
 
  On Sunday evening Asija had alleged that an unidentified person had sent him a death threat on his phone. “I’m under stress after reading the message and not in the proper state of mind to share more details about it,” he told TOI over the phone on Monday.
  
  Acting on Asija’s complaint, police late on Sunday night arrested a youth (whose name is being withheld by TOI on police request). At about 11:30 on Monday morning, while he was being taken for medical examination, he allegedly escaped from custody, said officials.
  
  Rajesh Kumar Srivastava, superintendent of police for Firozabad city said, “Police teams have been combing the city to arrest the fugitive. Some more men involved in threatening the   leader have been detained.”
  
  On September 19, Asija claimed that some unidentified assailants opened fire at his house at night. A bullet had allegedly pierced a windowpane of the kitchen on the first floor but, interestingly, was found on the road by Asija himself in the presence of police.
  
  The alleged firing took place just a day after   MP Akshay Yadav took out a march in support of Firozabad municipal commissioner Kamlesh Kumar, who had sought transfer after complaining of a death threat from Asija. Earlier, the Firozabad district hospital’s sole orthopedic doctor had resigned from his post levelling serious allegations against Asija.
  
  On Sunday, state finance minister Rajesh Agrawal visited Firozabad and met Asija. Agrawal said, “The government has taken cognizance of the attack on the MLA. Earlier, leaders used to be abducted, but now things have come under control.”
