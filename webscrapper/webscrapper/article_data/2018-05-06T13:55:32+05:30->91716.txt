COIMBATORE: Extoling the country’s prowess in producing generic medicines,  , vice-president of  , on Saturday hoped that the domestic companies launch a new drug in the global market.

 “We continue to dominate the generic drug segment. But, we are yet to independently launch a new drug in the global market,” he said on the sidelines of the inaugural function of a seminar on industrial pharmacy, quality control and assurance, and management at the Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Paramedical Sciences.
 
 “Product patent was introduced in 2005. But the domestic pharmaceutical companies have failed to develop new drugs due to lack of research and development activities,” Jayaseelan lamented.
 
 While a lot of multi-national pharma houses have opened their research and development centres across the country, the domestic counterparts have found it difficult to afford the huge expenses to produce a new molecule, he explained, adding that they might launch a new drug at the earliest.
 
 Pointing out that India had been exporting drugs to more than 200 countries across the globe, K  , president of TN state pharmacy council said it has made enviable strides in the front of generic medicines and ayurvedic and siddha new drugs.
 
 Supporting the e-pharmacies system, Chinnasamy said only pharmacists would deliver medicines to customers that too after verifying the doctor’s prescription. It would, in a way, ease the pain of moving from a pharmacy to anther in search of a particular medicine, he said.
 
 The seminar was organised by the Indian Pharmaceutical Association in collaboration with the Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Paramedical Sciences. The event was presided over by the deputy drug controller of   (CDSCO), S Manivannan.
