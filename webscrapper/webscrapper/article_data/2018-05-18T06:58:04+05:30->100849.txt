Veteran actor   said that mobile phones have become people's "alternate or secondary personality."

 
  
  "The mobile phone has become our alter ego; a person's alternate or secondary personality. There is reason to assess a person by the kind of mobile he or she uses," Amitabh wrote on his blog.
 
  "The make. the model. the colour. the cover... Where they keep it on their person, how often do they refer to it? What they use it for other than messages and communication. All of it represents a certain design of nature, a characteristic needing to be judged or understood," he added.
