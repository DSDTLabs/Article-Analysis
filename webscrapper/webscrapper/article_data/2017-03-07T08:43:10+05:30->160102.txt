HYDERABAD: Though the Telangana government has reorganised the districts and taken its tally to 31, as many as 20 of them still lack basic medical infrastructure. Only 10 have district-level hospitals, due to which there is ever-increasing patient load in the two major hospitals in the city, Osmania   and Gandhi Hospital.

 The state government is now aiming to set up at least one district-level hospital each to prevent long commutes to the state capital for medical needs. Health minister C Laxma Reddy has told officials to identify locations for construction of the hospitals. Available space in the compounds of existing area hospitals can also be earmarked.
 
 The minister has also asked officials to prepare rough budgetary estimates so that funds can be allocated in the 2017-18 budget. “We will develop area hospitals into district-level hospitals wherever we can,” he said.
 
 A district hospital, usually with 200-350 bed strength, is supposed to provide clinical specialities in all major medical fields, including gynaecology, anaesthesiology, paediatrics, orthopaedics and radiology, among others. However, there is a huge shortage of specialist doctors in the existing  .
 
 “We are aware that such a huge medical infrastructure requirment cannot be met in all the districts overnight. It will be done in a phased manner. If an area hospital has 100 beds, we will convert it into a 200-300 bedded district hospital. The requirement of medical equipment, doctors, nursing staff and other personnel is being worked out,” medical and health department special chief secretary,  , told TOI.
 
 Commissioner of family welfare, Aruna V, said that the state government is also seeking funds from the Centre under the   to set up eight specialised maternity and children’s hospitals. Currently, most such cases end up in   or the   at Petlaburj.
