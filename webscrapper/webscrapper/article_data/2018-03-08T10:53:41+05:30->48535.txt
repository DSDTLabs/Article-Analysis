 The trainers, about of eight of them aged between 70 and 82 years, interacted with the students, imparting the age-old lessons on how to pound for hulling millest to students. Interestingly, some of the trainers have their their own granddaughter as their trainees on the day.
 
 These women giving hands-on training on their skills said that with a traditional lifestyle, such as hand pounding grains and millets and having traditionally healthy food, thye were able to stand on their own. “It helped us to sand on our feet,” said one of the trainers
 
 The traditional way of life was tough but helped them stay fit in the long run, unlike the modern day when making dosa batter and preparing dough has become easy with the technology. They told the girls that food habits have changed now and these changes are not for good.
 
 The grandmothers also offered the girls the traditional millet-based food items prepared by them. Girls learnt and played traditional games such as pallankuli, pandi and thatta kal. Pechiammal, Maniammal, Kaliammal, Deivanai, Chellamma, Muniammal, Vadivammal and Papa who handled the two-hour long programme were honoured with mementos.
 
 Close to 50 mothers participated in the rangoli competition that was organized in the school as part of the women’s day celebrations.
