Sijoy Varghese, who recently stepped into Bollywood through Siddharth Malhotra-starrer Gentleman: Sundar, Susheel, Risky, is one of the few actors who have acted with both Dulquer Salmaan and  .

 His upcoming Malayalam project   had him extensively working with Pranav, who is making his debut as a hero with the Jeethu Joseph directorial.
 Sijoy says that working with Pranav was fun. “I found him to be a real-life Charlie! His passion for travel, music and books is amazing and as we talk, I am sure he might be scaling the Himalayas or enjoying the peace at Manasarovar,” says Sijoy.
 
 The actor is also all praise for Pranav’s simplicity. “Maybe it’s because we are aware of the stature he enjoys in the industry in spite of which he remains a down-to-earth personality,” he says.
 
 Charlie, the character played by Dulquer in the eponymous movie, isn’t the only similarity that Sijoy found in the two star kids. “I was also impressed watching Pranav pull-off daring stunts sans dupe, just like how Dulquer took up bike stunts all by himself in Bangalore Days,” he says. “Also, on the sets, you would always see Pranav playing a guitar and singing.”
 
 Sijoy, who was also part of Kunchacko Boban’s latest release and Aadu 2, plays a well-to-do businessman named Sidharth in Aadhi. “He is quite shrewd and is based out of Bengaluru. As opposed to the usual salt and pepper look, I will be sporting jet-black hair in the film,” he reveals.
 The actor is also part of Mammootty’s Parole, directed by Sharrath Sandith. “I play Mammootty’s brother-in-law, a Pala-based achayan,” he says. Sijoy is also debuting in Telugu soon and hints it would be in a major project featuring a superstar. “I play an underworld don in the film and it feels great to try yet another industry, after Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi. I hope that I enjoy Telugu as much as I do the other three languages,” signs off Sijoy.
