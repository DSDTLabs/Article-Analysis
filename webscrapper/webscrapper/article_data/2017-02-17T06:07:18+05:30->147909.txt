KOLHAPUR: The  , Kolhapur ( ) will be conducting its 11th   campus from February 23 to 25, stated a university official.

 The event has been organised for the university’s 53rd convocation ceremony for which over 50,000 visitors, including students, are likely to be on the campus. For the event around 50 book stalls will be set up from where visitors can buy books.
 
 “The three-day book festival which will be inaugurated on Thursday, will see participation of book publishers from across the region,” added the official.
 
 “The event, previous year, had over 50 stalls of different book publishers, including competitive book publishers, social, intellectual and other literary works of various authors. Back then, many of the publishers had offered a discount of 20-30% on the books,” said the official.
 
 Another SUK official said that they are hoping for a better response for the Teachers Personal Library Scheme (TPLS). “The TPLS scheme offers 50% discount to teaching as well as non-teaching faculties for buying books. Under the scheme along with teachers, class one, two and three officers of the university and affiliated colleges are allowed 50% grant on the purchasing of books,” he said.
 
 The budgetary provision was earlier restricted to Rs 1.5 lakh for the TPLS scheme, but was doubled to Rs 3 lakh in the year 2012-13. Under the scheme, teachers can buy books with respect to their field of expertise.
 
 The 25-year-old scheme, according to university officials, is valid twice a year where a teacher or an officer has to submit an application form for the grant. “However, so far, the response has been low,” added the official.
