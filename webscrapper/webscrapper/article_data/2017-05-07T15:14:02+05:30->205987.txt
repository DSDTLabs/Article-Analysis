A day after being dropped as a minister, AAP MLA   today levelled serious allegations of corruption against chief minister Arvind   and health minister Satyendar Jain.

 Mishra told mediapersons at Rajghat that he "saw" Jain handing over "Rs 2 crore" to Kejriwal at his official residence and on being asked, the CM evaded answering where the money came from and said "a few things in politics cannot be explained."
 
 Here's who said what about Mishra's allegations about 'corruption' within his own party:
 
 
 , 
 His allegations are not even worth responding to, they are so absurd and without any facts. No one will believe it.
 
 
 : Even Arvind Kejriwal's enemies would not believe that he can indulge in corruption.
 
 
 : The allegations raised by Kapil Mishra are not new. This must be immediately investigated. Kejriwal has lost the "moral and legal" right to continue as the CM of Delhi. Delhi is absolutely shocked by today's remarks by Kapil Mishra. It's not an allegation but the statement of a witness.
 
 
 :
 I knew that a lot of cash handling is happening in AAP.
 
 
  These are damning charges against Arvind Kejriwal.
 
 
  I might agree with the charges of power greed, arrogance, authoritarianism against Kejriwal, but the charge of taking bribe needs solid evidence.
 
 
  I stand vindicated on Arvind Kejriwal's criminal conspiracy with the water tanker mafia. I will raise it in the special assembly session on 9th May. I was bullied by the Delhi CM and his MLAs when I raised the scam in the Delhi Assembly. The Delhi CM has nowhere to hide now.
