HYDERABAD: At a time when colleges offering teacher education are ruing how approaching the National Assessment and   (NAAC) would prove to be a costly affair, they now have another fee to cough up. With the   ( ) signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the   (QCI), to handle the process of assessment and accreditation, college managements fear that each of them will have to pay about one lakh to QCI for the accreditation process. 

 "There is absolutely no need for NCTE to include QCI in the accreditation process. Earlier we used to send our appraisal and other reports to the regional offices directly. But now we have to upload it on the QCI site and for that, we have to shell another one lakh," said Vidya Sagar S, who owns a BEd and DEd college. 
 
  He said that the new rules of NCTE are undemocratic and claimed that NCTE was introducing the changes just to make more money.
 
 The Telangana BEd and DEd college managements association, meanwhile, said that they would seek legal help against the revised rules of NCTE.
 
 "The decision of NCTE to move regional offices to Delhi, ask colleges to deposit all the fixed deposits (FD) in one bank and share 50 per cent of the interest are unreasonable. So, we will be seeking legal help to fight against these developments," said S Prabhakar Reddy, state president of private BEd and DEd college managements association.
