LUDHIANA: Keeping in view the summer and upcoming rainy season the Mayor   pulled up the officials from operation and maintenance cell (O&M) and ask them to pay attention towards the cleaning of sewerage in the city. On Wednesday he took the meeting with officials and also directed them to   the garbage inside   so that there should not be any problem during rainy season. 

 The officials however informed the Mayor that for Buddha Nallah annual cleaning a budget worth Rs 95 lakh has been earmarked for this year but government sanction is pending so they are yet to transfer the amount to drainage department. Every year MC spends large amount on the disilting and cleaning of drain but in the absence of proper check on throwing garbage inside Buddha Nallah the efforts are getting wasted. 
 
 The Mayor also asked the officials to check the alignment of drain sides and in case there are chances of breaches in the drain at any point then it should be repaired immediately. It was the first meeting with O&M cell conducted by mayor and he also asked the officials to clean the road gulleys because during rainy season the road gulleys can help in draining the rain water but most of the times it has come to light that road gulleys were not cleaned properly and people faced water logging.
