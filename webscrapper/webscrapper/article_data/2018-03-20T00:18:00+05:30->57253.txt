Tirunelveli: Members of Manithaneya Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (MMMK) staged a demonstration in front of the Tirunelveli district collectorate on Monday before petitioning collector Sandeep Nanduri, asking him not to give permission for the ‘Ram Rajya Rath Yatra’ that is expected to enter the district through Sengottai on Tuesday.

 The yatra, organised by the Maharashtra unit of Kerala-based Sree Ramadasa Mission Universal Society was flagged off from Ayodhya on February 13. It is expected to conclude at Rameswaram on March 25. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, president of MMMK, ‘Palai’ Rafiq said the Vishwa Hindu Parishad established Sree Ramadasa Mission Universal Society to take out the yatra with the objective of creating ‘Ram Rajya’ in secular India. He said the yatra will affect the spirit of brotherhood among people from various communities who are living in harmony here.
 
 He recalled that during a similar yatra that was undertaken in the 1990s triggered clashes in many places and claimed many innocent lives, while properties worth several crores or rupees were destroyed in the riots. He claimed that the yatra poses a similar threat to inter-religious harmony here, and urged the collector to deny permission for the yatra.
 
  It may be recalled that during the previous weekly grievances meeting, the People’s Confederation Against Saffron Terrorism also submitted a similar petition in this connection to the collector.
