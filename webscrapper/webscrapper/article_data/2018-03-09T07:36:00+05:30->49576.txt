BATHINDA: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) members on Thursday held a protest outside the Faridkot deputy commissioner’s office against the additional DC’s alleged challenging the authority of its   Kultar Singh Sandhwan who represents Kotkapura constituency.

 Meanwhile, the DC office employees’ union president Gurnam Singh said the ADC was attending a meeting and the MLA barged in without any information. “He raised his voice unnecessarily and insulted the officer. We demand action against the MLA by March 9 or we will hold meeting on March 10 to decide the next course of action,” he alleged.
