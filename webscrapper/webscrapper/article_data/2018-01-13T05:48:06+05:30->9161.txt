NEW DELHI: CJI   had no wind of the press conference when he started proceedings in his court with Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud at 10.37 am on Friday.

 By 11 am, there was a buzz in the court corridors as a news portal flashed that a press conference by the four most senior judges was imminent. As journalists rushed to Justice J Chelameswar’s house, a message was sent to   Misra by the registry about the press conference at 12 noon. All four senior judges had quickly finished their day’s work, despite Friday being one of the busiest days of the week in terms of number of cases put up for hearing.
 
 The CJI-led bench got up abruptly at 12 noon and retired to the chamber, possibly to watch the presser which was being televised live on all news channels. Clueless lawyers came to know about the reason later and many were talking in the corridors as to why so many benches were breaking so early.
 
 Many speculated that the allegations against the CJI would make him nervous and he would not resume work. Contrary to it, the CJI-led bench resumed work at 2 pm and heard cases patiently while disposing of many. Though there was a streak of sadness on the CJI’s face, he remained composed.
