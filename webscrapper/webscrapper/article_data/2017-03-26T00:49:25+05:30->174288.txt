Gurgaon:   has finally come out of its slumber and promised to remove two high-tension electricity towers that cut through the middle of a six-lane   that connects St Xavier’s High School on Golf Course Extension road to Sector 66.

 Located in the middle of the two three-lane carriageways, the only connectivity for people living in sectors 66 and 67, the towers have been posing a serious threat to life. “We have initiated the process of shifting the two electricity towers from the carriageways to the side of the road,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav.
 
 The response came after this problem was highlighted in our One-Mile Project ground report on March 16. 
 
 Yadav said relocation work would be started at the earliest. “It may take a few months to complete the work. First, new towers will be installed on the side of the road. Then, existing ones will be removed,” explained Yadav. On lack of streetlights and barricades, which often lead to accidents on the stretch, Yadav claimed a proposal for putting up street lights and barriers had been sent to the Huda chief administrator for approval. 
 
 “Once we get approval, we will install street lights and barriers at the end of the road. Also, we will make speed-breakers to minimise accidents,” the Huda administrator said. 
 
 Aman Sharma, a resident of Sector 66, is not very excited with the Huda assurance, and would rather wait till it actually did the needful. 
 
 “We have been getting such assurances for long. We will believe in what they promise only when the towers are removed,” said Sharma. “No work has begun on the ground yet.”
