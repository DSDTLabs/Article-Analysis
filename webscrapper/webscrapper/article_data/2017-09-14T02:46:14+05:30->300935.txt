KOLKATA: Art lovers in the city are all set to get a gift from the   (KMC) ahead of the Pujas when a new gallery — to be christened   — on the ground floor of   throws open its gates this Saturday.

 “On Wednesday, a KMC team inspected the place to see if everything was in place,” said MMiC (parks and gardens)  . The gallery will have a display area of about 3,500 sqft. There will also be an amphitheatre for people to sit and enjoy plays and performances. 
 
 According to civic officials, KMC chose Star Theatre as there was no proper art gallery in the north.
 
 Star Theatre, which was set up in Hatibagan way back in 1888, was ravaged by a devastating fire in October, 1991. KMC restored the iconic building in 2004 when   was the mayor.
