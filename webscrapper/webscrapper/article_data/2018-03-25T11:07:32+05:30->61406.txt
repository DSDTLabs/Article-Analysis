KOCHI: Banks will continue, but the physical shape might evolve due to the disruption brought out by digital revolution, said experts who attended the panel discussion on digital future of banking, finance and retail at #Future, the digital summit in Kochi. The panel also observed that   could help create further jobs in the sector. “Many of us think of banking as a payment facility. There is much more to it than just a payment enabler. Banks, as we understand today in the payments space, are blurring and a lot is happening,” said   and CEO  .

 “Most people mistake bank for the physicality around it and the physicality may change – it has been changing for 5-10 years and regulations too have changed. RBI says that if you are present at a place for four hours a day for five days a week (in any form that is fixed in a location) it is considered a branch. We can put a bus, fully wired up and that could be considered as a branch. The concept of what a branch is changing. That doesn’t mean banking will disappear,” he said.
 
 
 When questioned whether banking will lose jobs because of digitalization,  , professor of international studies and economics,  , said: “The question has come up every time there is a technological revolution: whether it is a job enabler or whether we are going to end up with job loss. What we know from history is that it is a job creator. For instance, in 1980s, when ATMs were introduced in the US there was a big concern that there will be a big loss of employment in banking sector. What we saw that in 20-25 years, there was an increase in jobs, because with the ATMs, it became cheaper to run branches and hence there was 50% increase in the number of branches and an increase in employment,” she said.
