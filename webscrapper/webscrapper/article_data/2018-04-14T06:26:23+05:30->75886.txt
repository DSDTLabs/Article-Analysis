NEW DELHI: Already reeling under the steep   in Delhi Metro fares,   will now have to   for a hike in   too.

 Transport minister   told TOI that a   is being formed to decide on the revision of autorickshaw fares — last time the fares were hiked in 2013.
 
 “The committee will have officials from the Delhi government’s departments of finance and transport, apart from DTC and Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) officials. The committee will also have representatives from the autorickshaw unions,” said a government official. “The committee will deliberate on a revised fare structure keeping in mind inflation, rise in cost of maintenance of autorickshaws and also rise in fuel prices,” he added.
 
 In 2013, the government had hiked the fares of autorickshaws by 25%, keeping in view the increase in prices of CNG, spare parts, etc. The base fare of autorickshaws was raised from Rs 19 for the first two kilometres to Rs 25 and the fare for every subsequent kilometre was raised from Rs 6.5 to Rs 8.
 
 A meeting was held on Wednesday between senior transport officials and representatives of autorickshaw unions over fare revision. “We are in discussion with the government on fare hike. There has been no hike in fares since 2013, while everything has become expensive,” said Rajendra Soni, general secretary, Delhi Auto Rickshaw Sangh. “Apart from CNG prices going up in the last five years, maintenance of autorickshaws have become very expensive with the steep rise in prices of spare parts,” said Soni. 
 
 Not all auto unions, however, are in favour of a fare hike. “It will only help app-based cab aggregators. Also, there are many other problems the drivers face,” said Kishan Verma, president, All Delhi Auto Taxi Transport Congress.
