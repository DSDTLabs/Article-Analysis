VADODARA: Demolition drive by the   (VMC) sparked a ruckus at   in Subhanpura area on Monday. The razing teams of the civic body met with stiff resistance from the shop owners whose premises were to be razed. A police sub-inspector was also manhandled.

 Gorwa police registered a complaint of rioting and deterring public servants from performing their duties against eight persons. Even after giving ample time to the owner of one of the six shops to vacate the premises, he started arguing with VMC officials. Officials and police tried to use force to vacate the premises, while on the other hand the owner kept pushing them away.
 
 At one point, the situation became so tense that a police sub-inspector from Gorwa police station took out his gun, resulting in a panic. Those booked include Ramesh Ravbhani, Mukesh Agrawal and his two sons, Mahesh Agrawal, Ambu Agrawal and two unidentified persons.
 
 Amul Apartments that had shops on their ground floors had started leaning dangerously in April Last year. They were found unfit for living and the VMC ordered that they should be vacated. The residential floors of the apartment were razed even as the shops did not vacate the blocks and later approached a local court.
 
 The apartments were to be redeveloped in the form of high rise buildings and the shops were to be accommodated too. But a dispute had taken place regarding the number of shops. While the residents said that only five shops existed at the site and one of them was made illegally in the parking area, the shopkeepers maintained that there were six shops and all should be accommodated in the new plan. The dispute reached a local court that granted a stay on the razing of the shops. VMC officials said that the stay was vacated following which the   was taken up.
