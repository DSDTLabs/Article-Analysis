CHANDIGARH: Taking note of public resentment over commercial   rates, Chandigarh mayor Devesh Moudgil said the   is well aware of the issue. “I will leave the city if commercial parking rates are not taken back by the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation”, he said while interacting with residents during the TOI in conversation event.

 The mayor said   in commercial parking rates across the city burdens commuters, who do not even get facilities in exchange of such a high cost, said the mayor.
 
 Referring to the MoU the MC signed with the  , he said the company assured “smart parking” but there is nothing to show for it. He said
 
 He said the company has not fulfilled the dates of installments for the contract either. “We have prepared a point-wise report of 80 pages by a four-member team of councillors, which is to be tabled in the   on Monday”, he said.
 
  on the report, he said it states point-wise where all the boards are installed. He also said it has been found that the company is flouting the norms, as per which people are to be given a receipt at the kiosk and fee is to be charged at the exit. He said the contractor is charging fee at the entry instead. He also pointed out that norms are being violated on the installation of boards displaying parking in Hindi, English and Punjabi all over the city. “You can find the rates mentioned in only one language and the font is too small to be legible,” he said.
 
 The mayor also said the smart parking app does not work properly with people finding parking full even at 11pm. “How is it possible for parking to be full at 11pm in this city? For multilevel parking, there is a norm to have security guards round the clock, but they have only one person sitting outside the parking,” he said.
 
 The MoU provided for separate parking area for women and the disabled. But during a visit to the parking lot in Sector 17, he said he found two women struggling to park their cars.
