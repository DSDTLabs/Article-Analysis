PANAJI: Vamona Navelcar’s portrait on noted poet Fernando   was presented to Prime Minister   in Lisbon on Friday evening. Avertino Miranda who presented the portrait also gifted the Goan-origin PM with a miniature ghumot from the Gumatachem Fest at Siridao.

 Goans from all over the world including Goa partook in the 30th anniversary celebrations of Casa de Goa where a conference was held on ‘Sustainable Development in Goa in the 21st century’.
 
 Miranda, coordinator of Goa Green Brigade presented a paper on ‘People’s Struggles to save Goa’s Environment’ which highlighted people’s struggles in the state to save Goa’s environment from destruction on various fronts. The uprooting of trees, destroying of mangroves, flattening of sand dunes, and filing up of khazan lands along were all highlighted in his paper. He also focused on the recovery from illegal mining, justice for Bismarque Dias, the threat of pollution due to coal and a golf course displacing locals in Tiracol. 
 
 Amararam Gujar, first secretary, embassy of India, Lisbon, said India and the state of Goa are at the cusp of a massive transformation, matched by a resurgent and confident Portuguese economy. “In this golden moment, the sky is the limit to what   and Goa can do together. I hope that the report of the discussions in this conference will contain specific suggestions that can be presented to both governments for further study and consideration. I hope that this will become the first step towards launching a concrete roadmap for collaboration.” 
 
 Costa said the past is very important but emphasized building of stronger relations between India and Portugal. He offered exchange programs for students. Miranda said Goans received overwhelming support from the Goan diaspora to continue the fight for Goa’s environment.
