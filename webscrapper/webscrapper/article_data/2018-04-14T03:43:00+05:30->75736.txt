 Panaji: Goenkars against PDA (GAP), a citizens’ group, on Friday said it had not asked for the Town and Country Planning Act to be scrapped but had only sought that the act be amended to give villages a decision-making role in development.
 
 GAP convener Arturo D’Souza, said the main demand was for all villages to be removed from the Greater Panaji PDA jurisdiction and for the Town and Country Planning Act to be amended.
 
 “We have never demanded that the   department be disbanded,” D’Souza said. “Our demand is genuine and we will not rest till the people get the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments due to us.”
 
 GAP plans to take a delegation to meet TCP minister Vijai Sardesai to help clarify the villagers’ stand and discuss their demands. Though the association of villagers said it would be patient and would wait for Sardesai to allot an appointment, it said it would not wait for over a month.
 
 “If he does not listen to us, we will hold an agitation outside his house, we will sleep on the road near his house,” GAP member Rudolf Fernandes, said.
 
 Representatives from various villages along with farmers have come together to object to the constitution of the PDAs and implementation of the Regional Plan 2021.
 
 “It was chief minister Manohar Parrikar who kept the Regional Plan 2021 in abeyance and therefore, it was unjustified to make it operational in his absence,” D’Souza said while questioning Sardesai’s decision to implement RP 2021 without consulting the chief minister and the cabinet advisory committee.
