PUNE: The   police on Tuesday arrested a labourer and booked his wife for the murder of Kailas Taur, a fabrication and civil contractor, who was found dead in his house on Monday morning.

 Police said Taur had tried to force himself on the labourer’s wife in an inebriated condition, which prompted her husband to intervene and a scuffle ensued between the two. The victim sustained a head injury on hitting a wall during the scuffle, police added. 
 
 Senior inspector Ajay   told TOI that the labourer (name withheld to protect the woman’s identity), who is 33 years old, was picked up from Pimple Nilakh. 
 
 Taur (40), who originally hailed from Beed in  , was found murdered under mysterious circumstances in the bathroom of his house at Sangvi on Monday morning. Police had found chilli powder strewn all over the house.
 
 Police said Taur had returned to Sangvi on Sunday after dropping his family members at their native place and was alone in the house. He decided to party with the labourer, who used to work for him, in his house. The labourer along with his wife went to Taur’s house and they all had dinner together. After the dinner, the labourer’s wife went to sleep, while Taur and the labourer kept on drinking.
 
 Around midnight, Taur, who was in an inebriated condition, allegedly tried to rape the labourer’s wife. When the labourer saw what was happening, he beat him up and in the ensuing scuffle Taur got killed after his head was banged against the wall, police said.
 
 Chandkhede said Taur used to take fabrication and civil work contracts in   and surrounding areas. Taur’s two children and wife were in Beed when the incident took place.
