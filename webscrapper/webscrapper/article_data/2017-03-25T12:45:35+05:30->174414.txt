LOS ANGELES: Five-time major winner  , Britain's   and Spain's   advanced to the knockout rounds of the   with impressive triumphs Friday.

 Mickelson finished group play unbeaten after a 6-and-5 rout of fellow American J.B. Holmes while Rahm downed fellow Spaniard   6 and 4 to win his group at Austin (Texas) Country Club and reach Saturday morning's round of 16.
 
 It's the first time since 2004 that 46-year-old US left-hander Mickelson advanced past the third round of the event, falling to Davis Love in the quarter-finals 13 years ago when the event was a full knockout tournament.
 
 Casey downed South Africa's Charl Schwartzel 4 and 3 in the only Friday matchup of 2-0 players to decide a group crown.
 
 Mickelson dominated to advance, Holmes not making a birdie until the penultimate hole, Mickelson opened with back-to-back birdies and led 3-up after three holes, won the eighth as well with a birdie and took the 10th and 11th as well before closing out Holmes by halving with par at 13.
 
 Rahm birdied the third and fourth to seize the lead but Garcia answered to win the fifth with a birdie. Rahm birdies brought him wins at the ninth and 10th holes and back-to-back birdies at the par-5 12th and 13th set up Garcia's final concession on the 14th hole.
 
 Schwartzel birdied the first hole to seize the lead over Casey, but the Englishman squared the match with a par at the fourth and never trailed again.
 
 Several sudden-death playoffs were needed to decide who advanced after deadlocks in group play, the first of them to be decided going to American Kevin Na, who birdied the first playoff hole to down England's Matthew Fitzpatrick.
 
 World number two Rory McIlroy, eliminated after only one match thanks to group rival Gary Woodland's withdrawal and a loss to Kjeldsen, rallied to win 15 with a birdie and the par-5 16th with a par to halve his final match with Argentina's Emiliano Grillo.
