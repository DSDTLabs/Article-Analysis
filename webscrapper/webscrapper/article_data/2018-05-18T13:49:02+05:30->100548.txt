JAIPUR: Hitting out at the  , cabinet minister Arun   alleged that the party which for remaining in power had “annihilated the Constitution for political gains” for several decades, was now projecting itself as a protector of democracy.

 “Congress lacks internal democracy and has no role in saving democratic values in the country. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing,” said Chaturvedi, while briefing the media at the state   headquarters on Thursday. Minister for social justice and empowerment in the state, he was reacting to the opposition party’s attack on the BJP over   developments, accusing it of murdering democracy.
 
 Congress has a history of making unconstitutional amendments to remain in power, Chaturvedi alleged. “Since independence till the last UPA regime, Congress has annihilated the Constitution by making unconstitutional amendments for its political gains,” he claimed. He recalled that the then Congress government had imposed the President's Rule in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and   post Ayodhya temple movement in 1992.
 
 Speaking about the state, Chaturvedi claimed that the ruling BJP will retain power in Rajasthan in 2018 assembly election with a thumping majority. “The Vasundhara Raje led BJP government in the state has done much better work than the previous Congress government and set records in terms of developmental work. The state is leading in several sectors,” he added.
