Chennai: An expert appraisal committee from the Union  , forests and climate change will visit   on Friday to verify the legality and environmental acceptability of the   expansion project. Fishermen, environmental activists and other prominent personalities like Kamal Haasan and Kanimozhi have raised their voices in support of protecting the creek.

 Writer and social activist Nityanand Jayaram received a confirmation mail from the ministry that the expert committee will visit the site to verify the claims of the protesters and find out if the expansion of the port will affect the creek. 
 
 Under this project, the port has proposed diverting 1,000 acres of the creek to create port infrastructure such as petrochemical parks, a storage area and other facilities. Already several portions of the creek were disturbed due to dumping of flyash from the two thermal power stations functioning there. This proposal by the Kamarajar Port will worsen the situation, activists said.
 
 The expert committee will also interact with fisherfolk in Ennore and its surroundings. They will also hold a meeting with activists and other stakeholders in the area, Jayaram said.
 
 Fishermen staged a protest on Wednesday on the banks of the creek demanding that the government withdraw the new coastal regulation map which does not take into consideration the existence of the swampy water body at the mouth of the Kosasthalayar river. 
 
 A couple of months ago, Kamal visited the locality and interacted with residents.
