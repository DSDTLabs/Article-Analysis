HYDERABAD: AICC secretary and former MP   has met Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister   in Delhi and told her that Telangana chief minister   is not a candidate to be trusted.

 “KCR is known for betraying all those who trust him. He had promised to merge TRS with Congress if statehood was granted to Telangana but betrayed Sonia Gandhi after she gave Telangana State. Likewise, KCR after coming to power, dumped Telangana Joint Action Committee leader Prof M Kodandaram who led the Telangana statehood agitation along with KCR,” he said, quoting from his conversation with Mamata Banerjee.
 
 “I also told Mamata madam that the twinobjective of CM KCR in announcing the need for formation of a federal front was to help   by dividing anti-Modi and anti-BJP parties, and also to pave way for his son   to become CM,” he said. He said Banerjee gave him a patient hearing.
