Ludhiana: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar on Wednesday visited the house of pastor Sultan Masih, who was shot dead by motorcycle-borne assailants on Saturday. Consoling the family of the deceased, Jakhar assured them that the culprits would soon be behind bars. He was accompanied by local MLAs, including Surinder Dawar, Sanjay Talwar, Kuldeep Singh Vaid and Rakesh Pandey.

 Meanwhile speaking to mediapersons later at circuit house on Wednesday, Jakhar said the killing of Pastor Masih was unfortunate and a cowardly act. He added that the people of Ludhiana deserved praise for being patient and maintaining communal harmony. Jakhar said the state government was making all efforts to maintain law and order and everything would be done to ensure that justice was delivered to the family of Masih.
 
 “The police has been given a free hand to investigate the matter of Masih’s murder that seems to be the handiwork of people who want to disturb peace and harmony in the state. It’s up to the police to take the help of CBI, IB or the NIA to solve this case. Unlike the previous regime, Punjab police is working freely without and interference from the Congress government,” he added. 
 
 Commenting on the issue of series of unsolved killings of religious leaders and the followers of sects and other outfits Jakhar said, “It is beyond doubt that these cold blooded killings have been executed with the motive of destabilising the peace. Investigating agencies including the CBI and Punjab police are working on the cases and we hope that the result of their investigation would be out in the open soon.”
