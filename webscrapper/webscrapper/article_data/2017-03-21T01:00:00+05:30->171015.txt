 The fight took place recently on a flight while they were returning to Mumbai from Melbourne. An inebriated Kapil reportedly started hurling abuses at comedian  , who also stars in his comedy show. Sunil tried to intervene which angered Kapil further and he started hitting him. Says a source, “Kapil continued his tirade and told them that whatever they are today is because of him. He called Sunil a flop actor, who came to him crawling for work after his show tanked. He also told Chandan that he has work today because he is a friend. Some passengers even wanted an emergency landing due to this ruckus.”
 
 The incident has shaken the entire cast of the show; while Sunil has decided to quit, Chandan may follow suit. The other actors, meanwhile, have decided to boycott it for an indefinite period. “What Kapil did can’t be justified. You can’t drink and use foul language. It’s unbecoming of a public figure,” says a unit member.
 Apparently, there have been ego issues between Kapil and Sunil since a long time, but they managed to put it aside. This time though, it seems like the incident has marked an end to an enviable professional association. 
 
 Despite repeated attempts, Sunil neither answered our calls nor responded to our text messages.
