COIMBATORE:   at the   during rainy days remains an unsolved issue for several decades. But this time, people were shocked to find the   causing   for the past one week. Nearly two-foot water filled up the underpass. 

 “An apartment complex is located close by and the sewage from the apartment flows through the underground pipes. But when it gets blocked, the pressure forces the sewer lids to open which leads to flooding in that area. The underpass is a low-lying area and gets water-logged,” said corporation engineer Ramesh. He said that this was a recurring issue and they were looking to find a permanent solution for it. 
 
 “We have planned to set up drains in the area. We also plan to hold a meeting with the apartment owners to ensure that the sewage is directed to the other direction. We will submit the proposal soon to our senior officials and ensure that the problem is resolved soon,” Ramesh said.
 
 Senior corporation officials said that they have already started work on Lanka Corner water-logging issue. “We are constructing drains near Lanka Corner and have found a permanent solution for water-logging there. Similarly, we will resolve this issue as well,” said a senior engineer.
 
 Meanwhile, residents said that the area has been water logged for more than 10 days. “Since Brookfield Mall is located close-by and a school is also situated near the underpass, there are huge traffic jams here. The area is almost choked by the traffic coming from Gandhipuram, Ram Nagar and R S Puram. Because of the water logging, many two-wheelers also get stuck in the puddle,” said a resident. He added that this was not the first time. “This happens once in every two months. The civic body needs to take responsibility and resolve it,” said a commuter. 
 
 Corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said that the issue was resolved and the water was pumped out on Tuesday evening after complaints were received. “We will find a permanent solution for the problem,” he said.
