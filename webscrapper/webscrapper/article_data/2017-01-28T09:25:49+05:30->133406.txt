KOLHAPUR: Registration of new vehicles in Kolhapur region declined by about 60% in December last year as compared to the corresponding month in 2015, according to figures available with the regional transport office (RTO). 

 Moreover, registration of new vehicles in the region in the December last also reported a 50% fall compared to the average monthly figures since May 2016.
 
 Deputy RTO   attributed the decline in new vehicle registrations to demonetisation of high value currencies. “Cash crunch prevailed following the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, due to which people could not buy new vehicles. We had registered 16,477 new vehicles in December 2014 in the region. The number went up to 21,680 in December 2015. But the number declined to 8,721 in December 2016.”
 
 The vehicles that registered a decline in December last in the Kolhapur region comprising Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Karad talukas were two-wheelers, tractors and cars .
 
 Another official said the growth trajectory of vehicles halted due to the “man-made crisis”. “The poor monsoon in the last two years had already slowed down the growth. We did not see much impact in November as people bought vehicles in the first week of November owing to Diwali auspicious days,” he said. 
 
 “The demonetisation impact could be seen in December. “Kolhapur district was a bright spot in the region as it registered 7,281 vehicles. After Kolhapur, Karad taulka registered 1,440 vehicles. It is surprising that Sangli and Satara failed to register a single vehicle,” the official added..
