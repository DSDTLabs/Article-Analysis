NAGPUR: His agonizing wait of 22 years for getting absorbed as a permanent employee is yet to be over. There is, however, a ray of hope for him after   (MAT) asked the Chandrapur collector on Thursday to be personally present on March 9 for committing contempt of its earlier order, issued about a decade ago.

 Applicant Murari Lohkare (54) joined the   as muster assistant in the Group-C category on temporary basis. The   came out with two notifications on December 1, 1995, and April 30, 1995, for making temporary persons working on this post permanent and also pay their dues from May 31, 1993.
 
 However, the collectorate neither made Lohkare permanent nor granted him any dues for about a decade. This led him to knock the MAT’s doors in 2004. 
 
 On June 23, 2006, MAT directed the collector to absorb Lohkare in the permanent grade and pay his dues from May 1993, as directed by two government notifications.
 
 The collector then informed that he had already dispatched the proposal in this regard to the government where it was pending. Accordingly, the case was disposed of.
 
 When there was no progress for five more years, the 54-year-old filed several applications with the collector’s office and even served a legal notice. But when nothing moved, he filed a contempt petition through counsel Ganesh Khanzode assisted by Prachi Joshi and Gaurav Khond. Lawyer AM Khedkar appeared on behalf of the forest department.
 
 The application was listed before member judicial  , who observed that the collector has failed to take any steps since the last decade. 
 
 Taking serious cognizance of the apathy, the judge summoned the collector on March 9 where he was asked to explain his position behind the inordinate delay.
