NAGPUR: The   ( ) board of directors will take decision on extension to private operator   (OCW) for completion of 24X7 water supply project in the meeting organized on May 2. The decision has been kept pending since last 13 months, thus extending benefits to the operator.

 The NESL board will also discuss complaints regarding drinking water crisis and large-scale contaminated supply. During the general body meeting held few days ago, corporators from all political parties, including BJP-led ruling alliance, had slammed the OCW for the water shortage and contaminated supply.
 
 The board, comprising mayor Nanda Jichkar as chairman, ruling party leader Sandip Joshi, municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal and other officials and office-bearers are likely to prepare a plan to tackle water crisis for May and two weeks of June.
 
 The OCW is likely to give presentation on status of the 24X7 water supply project and also hurdles faced in its implementation.
 
 The NMC had handed over operation and maintenance of water works to OCW, along with implementation of Rs387.86 crore 24X7 water supply project sanctioned by the central government under JNNURM scheme, from March 1, 2012. Target was to cover 3.20 lakh houses under 24X7 project and bring down water losses to 15% among other measures by March 1, 2017.
 
 As per the NMCâ€™s data, 48,000 houses are getting 24X7 water supply as on date. Against water supply of 640 million litres per day (MLD), water billing is being done for 260 MLD, a direct loss of around 60%.
 
 The NMC was supposed to make the OCW accountable for low water billing, losses, unequal distribution, less revenue etc from March 1, 2017. The operator had sought extension of two years in February 2017. The NMC has not taken any decision so far. The civic body is paying the OCW as per old system and also not taking any other action for failure to comply with the conditions.
