KOLKATA: A 6,000-pound truck fell off   in north Kolkata early on Sunday and landed on a road 20 feet below. Cops said the trucker was trying to avoid an accident when he crashed into the railing and flipped off the bridge landing on the road. 

 Luckily, the truck driver was able to leave the cabin in time and latch on to the branches of a tree below the bridge as the truck crashed onto the road and broke into several parts. 
 
 The incident happened around 12.10am on Sunday on the southern slope of   bridge. The truck was heading towards   crossing from Chiria More end. Witnesses said a biker heading towards Chiria More had suddenly changed lane and in a bid to avert a collision with the motorbike, the truck driver swerved right, resulting in a collision with an Ola cab before crashing into iron rails dividing the sidewalk from the bridge and the concrete rails of the bridge.
 
 The driver, Baliram Roy (47), a resident Raigunj, suffered severe head injuries.
 
 "The impact was so profuse the truck's axle broke away and the vehicle broke into four parts. Four cranes had to be deployed to remove the broken vehicle from the road. Luckily, there was no one walking on the road below the bridge or on the footpath when the accident happened. Or else, it could have been traumatic," said Samir Das, a local. 
 
 The driver was rescued and was admitted to RG Kar Hospital. The Ola cab was damaged but its driver escaped with minor injuries.
