NEW DELHI: The US dropping its 
  ever on   is "not (about) the war on terror", it's about using the mountainous country "as (a) testing ground for new and dangerous weapons", said former President  .

  
  
 
 
 The Afghan leader tweeted his concern after the US dropped 
  on eastern Afghanistan yesterday, as part of what it calls its "war on terror".
 
 The media is agog the bomb is the heaviest ever. But how deadly is its force? Military experts say its explosion is equivalent to 11 tons of TNT and the blast radius is a mile wide, news agencies reported.
 
  
  
 
 
 Karzai believes this is more than just a "war on terror" and implied no one would help Afghanistan "stop the US" so it is "upon us, the Aghans" to do so.
 
 
  
  
 
 The US believes it's right and is firm that using the   is the only way out.
 
 ``This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K,'' said   gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, according to AP.
 
 The Pentagon said it had no early estimate of deaths or damage caused by its attack, which US President Donald Trump called a ``very, very successful mission.''
 
 Nicholson said the strike was designed to minimize the risk to Afghan and U.S. forces conducting clearing operations in the Achin area ``while maximizing the destruction'' of IS fighters and facilities. 
 
 "The decision to drop the MOAB in eastern Afghanistan sends a clear message that the US is committed and determined to defeating ISIS and other terrorist organisations in Afghanistan," said Senator Jim Inhofe, senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
