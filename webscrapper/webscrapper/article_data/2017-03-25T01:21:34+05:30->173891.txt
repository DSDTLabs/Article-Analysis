MUMBAI: Passengers travelling to the US with a transit halt in the Middle East will have to pack their laptops and other electronic devices larger than a smart phone into their check-in bags from Saturday. 

 Since Emirates has launched a service, its passengers can carry their laptops in their hand baggage till Dubai and use it during transit, but before they board the   to the US they will have to hand over the banned electronic devices to security staff at the gate. 
 
 One of every two passenger from India who travels to the US transits through the Middle East, so the new security measures will hit those from the country greatly. Emirates had said its customers should be aware that there will be a detailed search of hand baggage on non-stop flights to the US from Dubai. 
 
 A US-based Indian said, “The ban does not make sense as it is only for selective countries. Abu Dhabi airport has a US customs and immigration hall that does screening for passengers going to the US. What logic is there to ban this airport? UK has also placed a ban but Dubai and Abu Dhabi are not on that list.” He plans to visit India in June and has booked a ticket on a Middle Eastern carrier “The ban is a inconvenience for families with kids who are on long-haul flights of about 15 hours. I need to work with my   or tablet, and unfortunately this is not possible,” he added.
