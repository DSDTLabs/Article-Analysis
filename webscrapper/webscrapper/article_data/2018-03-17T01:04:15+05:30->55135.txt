NEW DELHI:   M   on Friday warned that he would be compelled to take an “extreme view” if the continuing logjam in the upper   did not end, stressing that   was meant to discuss and debate as well as decide on importance issues confronting the nation.

 
 Expressing hope that   would function normally with “constructive debates” from next week, Naidu said, “I am very much pained that the upper House has not been able to transact its business for the last two weeks. Don’t test my patience... We are meeting, greeting and not doing anything and adjourning. 
 
 “We have to go by consensus or by the majority of the House. You can’t dictate something and say my way or the highway. That is no way, I must tell you.”
