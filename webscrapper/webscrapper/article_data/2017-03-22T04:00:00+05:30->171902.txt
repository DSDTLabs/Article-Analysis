Gandhinagar: The state government has said that it has told all universities in the state to implement reservations in various bodies. Viramgam MLA Tejashreeben Patel had sought information on the reservation policy for senate, syndicate, and academic councils. The government said the issue had been brought to its notice in 2007 and the higher education commissioner had that year and in 2012 written to universities asking them to implement reservations. But universities, which were to pass a resolution on reservations, are yet to forward the notification on implementation. tnn
