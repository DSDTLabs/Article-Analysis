PATNA: Thousands of passengers remained stranded at   bus stand and other bus stands across   on Monday due to the one-day statewide strike called by  . 

 Owners of buses and auto-rickshaws joined the strike to protest hike in fees for driving test, address change, licence and fitness tests as proposed by the 22nd amendment in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules which came into effect in December last year. The fee has been revised for the first time since 1989. 
 
 Nearly 3,000 buses travel to all over the state and other states from Mithapur bus stand. An estimated 3 lakh passengers board buses from this bus stand. This generates nearly Rs 1 lakh per day taxes for the state and central governments. 
 
 Passengers met with a similar situation at   bus stand, where around 2500 buses cater to travellers per day. 
 
 Chairman of Bihar Motor Transport Federation Udai Shankar Prasad Singh said the strike was relaxed after 5pm keeping in mind the problems it would cause to the general public.
 
 Very few autos and buses could be seen plying on the roads of Patna on Monday, much to the discomfort of college students and office-goers. “It wouldn’t have been so troublesome had it not been Monday,” said Ankita, a first year degree student of Magadh Mahila College.
