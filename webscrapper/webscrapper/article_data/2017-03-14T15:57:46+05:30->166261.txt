CHENNAI: In a rare self-indictment, the Madras high court on Tuesday conceded that it had indeed erred in not deciding a case that sought transfer of the sensational   ‘encounter’ killing case of 2003 to the   for a fair  .

 “Yes, we accept the blame. At this length of time, we could only express our regret. We assure the people of this country that this would not be repeated,” said a bench of Justice S Nagamuthu and Justice Anita Sumanth. For the record, the case was referred to the bench only in 2015, though the matter was pending since 2004.
 
 Venkatesa Pannaiyar was killed in an ‘encounter’ with police in Chennai on September 26, 2003. The controversial killing shook the state so much that his wife V Radhika Selvi rode the sympathy wave, won the Tiruchendur parliamentary constituency on DMK ticket and became the Union minister of state for home.
 
 Immediately after the ‘encounter’ killing, she filed a petition for a CBI probe, saying her husband was not a gangster as was made out to be, and that he did not have a gun and had not tried to shoot a police team led by the then deputy commissioner of police S S Krishnamoorthi. A second petition with the same prayer was filed by one Balamurali.
 
 The petition to transfer the case to the CBI should have been given preference and disposed of within a reasonable period of time, the bench said, adding: “The urgency and importance of the issues and the serious violation of fundamental rights alleged in the writ petition had missed the attention of this court for 13 long years. Since the court omitted inadvertently to give preference to the petitions so as to ensure fair, proper, impartial and speedy investigation, there has occurred failure of justice to the petitioners.”
 
 Seeking to offer at least a ‘minimum possible’ relief to the petitioner, as the petitioner cannot go without even getting the cost from the state, the judges directed the state government to pay Rs 25,000 as compensation to the petitioners.
