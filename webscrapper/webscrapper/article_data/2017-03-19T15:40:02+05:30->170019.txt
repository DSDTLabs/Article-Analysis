Just few days after an anonymous blog post allegedly accusing   ( ) CEO and Founder   surfaced online, the channel seems to have suffered another blow.

 Reports suggest that actress   who was supposed to shoot a promotional video with TVF has apparently backed out of it following the TVF molestation row. 
 
 Konkona was supposed to promote her next ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’ through this video on their channel, but seems like she has denied to do so after TVF’s recent controversy. 
 
 According to sources, ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’ is a film that revolves around the lives of four women of different ages in for freedom. The film was already making news after CBFC had denied certification to it. And post the whole TVF controversy Konkona wasn’t too keen on the association with the channel.
