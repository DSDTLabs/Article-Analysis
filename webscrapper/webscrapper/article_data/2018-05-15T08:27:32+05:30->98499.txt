PANAJI: While radiosondes are being used over the past decades to predict   forecast, it was the accuracy of the new and updated device at the meteorological department ( ) in Goa that helped determine the local phenomenon that occurred last week. Use of this device was adopted by the department in March this year.

  
  
 
 TOI had earlier reported the local phenomenon wherein a 45-minute thunderstorm accompanied by a heavy spell of rain and gusty winds lashed many parts of the state in the wee hours of Thursday morning.
 
 “We gave the forecast on Wednesday at 10.30am based on information gathered from the radiosonde. By 12pm that day, the forecast that thunderstorms will occur was disseminated all over Goa,” said   director, M L Sahu.
 
 The report produced by the new device comes in a coded form that is detailed by a computer software at the IMD. This is manually plotted on an atmosphere map by IMD scientists. On the basis of the chart analysis and various indexes, the experts arrive at a conclusion to determine the local phenomenon.
 
 Sahu further said that the Doppler Radar is also used for further accuracy. On Wednesday evening, with the help of the Doppler Radar, IMD gave the nowcast as well.
 
  “The nowcast warned of a thunderstorm with lightning and details of the wind speed. Therefore, two weathers warning were given on Wednesday.” he said.
 
 Additionally, this observation is also used in aviation. The IMD transmits its data all over the world within an hour of acquiring it from the device and uploads the same to its website. This information is further picked up by other sites associated with the world meteorological organization where people can source the data.
 
 “Besides the Goa airport, any flight that is passing over Goa can make use of this information before take-off,” Sahu said.
