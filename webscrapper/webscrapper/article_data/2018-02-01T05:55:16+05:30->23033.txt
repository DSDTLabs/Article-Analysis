AMRITSAR: There is much disappointment among as many as 200 Pakistani Hindus aspiring to undertake pilgrimage in various parts of India after they were given visa to travel only to Amritsar in February. The Hindu jatha also includes families who have preserved ashes of their deceased family members for immersing in the Ganga at Haridwar.

 President of Pakistan Hindu Sewa Welfare Trust Sanjesh Dhanja told TOI over phone from   on Wednesday, "We are confused whether to travel to India or not because we have been given visa for Amritsar only."
 
 Dhanja said the Indian high commission issued visas for 200 people - 150 issued five day visa and 50 issued 15-day visa - but only to travel to Amritsar city. "We had applied for visas to travel to Surat, Haridwar, Delhi, Amritsar and Mumbai, but everyone has been given visa to travel to Amritsar alone," he said, adding that as many as 30 pilgrims had preserved ashes of their deceased family ones for performing their last rituals and immersing their ashes in the Ganga at Haridwar. "They are very disappointed. We have now sought help from the Indian government."
 
 Dhanja added that they have also written to Indian external affairs minister Sushma   seeking her intervention for at least allowing them to visit Haridwar, besides extending their duration of stay in India.
 
 In a letter to   on Wednesday, a copy of which was sent to TOI by the trust, the members have stated, "In Amritsar we can only go to Golden Temple that is for Sikh dharma yatra. Most of the people in this group are also coming with ashes of their relatives for immersion in the Ganga and also to perform pujas. We would also want to go on pilgrimage to Mathura and Vrindavan."
 
 Dhanja expressed hope that Swaraj would take note of the situation and help the Pakistani Hindu pilgrims.
