THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Going against the speculation about a change its stance following debacle in recently-concluded   polls, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)   unit is still against any tie-up with Congress in near future.

 
 The party's state unit is still in support of senior party leader   who has been opposing any sort of tie-up with the grand old party. The party's Kerala unit's draft, to be tabled at   Congress next month, affirms not to have ties with Congress to fight against BJP.
 
 However, CPI(M) secretary general   and the party's Bengal unit is strongly in favour of a tie-up with Congress to counter BJP. 
 
 Following rout in its stronghold Tripura, it was believed that the Karat faction and the party's Kerala unit will reconsider its stance. 
 
 The matter is expected to be taken up for discussion in its national meet scheduled next month.
