PUNE: The state government has indicated that the   ( ) must take care of its garbage by setting up processing units within the civic limits as villages around the city have strongly opposed the setting up of processing units in their localities.

 Minister of state and Purandar MLA   said, “The state wants all party corporators to look for land in their wards and set up small garbage processing units. This is the only way as   villagers are already on the road agitating against the garbage processing unit proposal. No village will take the city's trash, and hence, there is no other option than to look for a solution within city.“
 
 Shivtare added, “Some Pune corporators continue to oppose garbage processing in their wards saying people don't want the project in their locality. But why should villagers take the trash?“ Officials of the civic administration are talking to   leaders to call a meeting of their party corporators.“If the ruling party corporators cooperate and start units in their locality, things will be easy for the administration,“ a senior civic official said.
 
 The PMC has set up 25 small garbage processing projects, which take cares of about 5 tonnes of garbage in respective localities. However, civic officials complained that newly-elected members are coming up with the demand to close the processing units in their wards as the foul smell has become a permanent problem for their voters. The new members have alleged that their predecessors allowed the PMC to set up these units without taking people into confidence.
