KADAPA: The tragedy in   could have been averted if the   ( ) engineering officials were a little more cautious while erecting the makeshift tents with iron sheets. They used aluminium wires to affix iron sheets on the roof instead of ‘J’ clamps with bolts.

 The fire department identified that the aluminium wire could not withstand the force of wind. District fire officer of Kadapa, S  , told   that as one joint broke, the centre of mass of iron sheet shifted which increased the force on other joints causing them to snap.
 
 Another point that Srinivasa Rao made was that no one from TTD sought suggestions from the fire department. Had they asked us about the safety measures to be taken while erecting the temporary tents using iron sheets, we would have advised them to use ‘J’ clamps fixed with bolts.
 
 However, the TTD officials argue that even the ‘J’ clamps could not stand the kind of squall that came on Friday.
