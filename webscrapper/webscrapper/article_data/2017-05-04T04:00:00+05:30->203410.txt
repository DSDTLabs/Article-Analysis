Surat: City police commissioner Satish Sharma ordered an inquiry on Wednesday against the staff of Ichhapore police station after a recent raid by state monitoring cell at a country liquor brewery in Mora village led to recovery of country liquor and brewing ingredients worth Rs83,710. It is one of the major seizures of country liquor and brewing ingredients soon after two hooch tragedies hit city and rural areas of Surat district.

 S M Patel, police inspector of Icchapore police station, was on Tuesday transferred to special branch of the city police commissioner’s office as the local police had failed to implement prohibition law in their area despite strict warning. The raid was in continuation of few others by the state monitoring cell that works under the supervision of director general of police.
 
 “An inquiry has been ordered against the police staff of Ichhapore police station and those found responsible will be punished. I recently had issued a warning that I will take strict action against police officers in case of a raid by any other raiding agency,” Sharma said. 
 
 “In recent past, some agencies had carried out successful raids in different areas but local police were actively involved. Hence, no action was taken against the officers. But when the local police are found inactive, the officers will face action,” he added.
