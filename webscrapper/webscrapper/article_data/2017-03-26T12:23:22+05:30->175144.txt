In a recent tweet by Ram Gopal Varma, his passive attack on Power Star Pawan Kalyan, commenced yet another ugly Twitter attack.

 RGV stooped so low in his series of late night tweets that he also targeted Pawan’s personal life and family on social media website. Needless to say, he received heavy criticism from many Tollywood stalwarts as well as from the Power Star’s fans.
 
 In the tweet, Ram Gopal Verma indirectly blamed Pawan for wrapping up the shoot of the latter’s recently released film ‘Katamarayudu’ in less than 30 crores, and pocketing 100 crores from the movie’s distribution rights.
