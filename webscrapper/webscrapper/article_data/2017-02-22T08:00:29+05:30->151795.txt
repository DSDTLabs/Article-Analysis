The accused then forced the girl to sit on his bike and rode to his closed hookah parlour,“ Chandrayangutta inspector Y Prakash Reddy said. Bawazir was accompanied by Mohsin and two juvenile offenders on another bike. “While Mohsin and the juvenile offenders stood guard outside the hookah parlour, Bawazir raped the girl and let her go home after a few hours with a warning not to tell anyone about the incident,“ the inspector said.
 
 But locals had alerted the parents of the girl about her abduction by Bawazir and the victim's mother approached police. As cops were about to launch a search operation, the girl returned home.
 
 The victim told her mother about her ordeal and, based on her complaint, police registered cases against all the four accused. The victim was sent for medical examination and the main accused were taken into custody on Tuesday evening from their hideout at Barkas.
