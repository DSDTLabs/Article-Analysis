PATNA: The state government has sought a report on the estimated cost of renovation of the dilapidated Buxar Central Jail.

 The government’s move follows the escape of five convicts on December 31 from the dilapidated jail of colonial days. The convicts made good their escape through a ventilator after scaling through two boundary walls of 22 and 12ft height. 
 
 One of the escapees,  , was re-arrested from Chhapra on January 3. The four others are still at large.
 
 IG (prisons)   said on Wednesday the district administration would soon submit a report, containing details of estimated expenditure to renovate the jail. “The government will take similar steps for all the jails that require repairs,” he said and added the security of the prisons would also be audited soon.
 
  sources said the building, erected during the British rule, is in dilapidated state and several minor construction works are required frequently. “It was through one such dilapidated ventilator with rusted iron bars that the convicts fled,” said a source, adding the 29-ward jail is spread over 145 acres of land. There are currently around 800 inmates in the jail. 
 
 Meanwhile, Buxar SP   said efforts were on to re-arrest the escapees.
