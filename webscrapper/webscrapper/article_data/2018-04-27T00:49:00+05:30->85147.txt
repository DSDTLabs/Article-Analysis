Trichy: Stating that many people, including the opposition are attempting to split the AIADMK by instigating various protest across the state, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said here on Thursday that nobody can succeed in their mission. “This is evident from the support of the huge crowds waiting on both sides of the road from the airport to welcome me,” said Palaniswami, while speaking at the opening of the new party office situated at Highways Colony in Subramaniyapuram. 

 Terming Trichy as the fortress of the AIADMK, the chief Minister extended his gratitude to the people stating that it was they who had smashed the dreams of the opposition parties by gathering there in large numbers.
 
 Speaking on the Cauvery issue, the chief minister said, “It is late chief minister M G Ramachandran who first voice his demand for the formation of the Cauvery Management Board in 1986. Following his footsteps, late chief minister J Jayalalithaa initiated a legal battle and she had won it.”
 
 “Whether it is Cauvery or Mullaperiyar or Palar issues, we will definitely win by finding an amicable solution by following the footsteps of our late leader J Jayalalithaa, who won the battle in Mullaperiyar issue, Palaniswami said.
