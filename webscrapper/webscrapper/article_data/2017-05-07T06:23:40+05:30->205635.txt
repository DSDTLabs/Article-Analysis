KOCHI: Mar Thoma Valiya Metropolitan Philipose Mar Chrysostom, who is known for his wit and sense of humour, made a short visit to CariToon Kochi-2017 on Saturday, where 10 acclaimed caricature artists and cartoonists from   and other states drew his image on paper in a matter of few minutes. 

 Thrilled by the uniqueness of each caricature and its exaggerations, the 100-year-old Metropolitan praised the artists for their ability to individually identify the unique identities of the person in front of them and said that if political, and church leaders were also able to accommodate this virtue then "the world would be a better place".
 
 Sudheer Nath, secretary of the  , said that the Metropolitan had plans of attending the inaugural session of CariToons but was unable to attend the occasion as he was not feeling well at the time. Then it was agreed that Reverend would attend that last day of the Caritoon's National Camp organized by the  . 
 
 "The biggest problem we face is that people do not pay attention to other people and what they have to say. Cartoonists are among those who always listens and pays heed to each individual," he said. 
 
 He concluded his talk by emphasising on the influence that a cartoonist can have on the political discourse of the state and nation: "The public opinion is in your hands."
 
 The festival will end on Sunday. Minister for health and social justice   will inaugurate the first event of the day, which will be a live spot drawing event by illustrators   and Swapna Augustine. Both artists will take part in an interactive session after the drawing event. This will be followed by a seminar on woman empowerment.
