NEW DELHI: Too much of cricket and not having an off-season is the reason for Indian captain   being deprived of the chance to prepare himself for the England tour, according to former Indian captain  . 

 
 Reacting to Kohli’s neck injury which ruled him out of the Country spell, Kapil said: “We are playing too much cricket and the cricketers aren’t getting enough time to rest. You can’t really blame anyone if a top cricketer like Kohli gets injured.”
 
 “The fact that our cricketers don’t get off-season is also hurting them. I think off-season is the most ideal time to recover from all small and big injuries,” Kapil said, while reflecting on the workload that has led to frequent injuries to Indian cricketers.
 
 Kapil added that his secret idea of staying fit and playing uninterrupted Test matches for India was because he was able to recover during the off-season. 
 
 “It’s not that I didn’t have injuries. But I got the time to recover during off-season. You have to be a little lucky as well,” Kapil said.
 
 Before signing off, he said: “You also have to keep trying harder and know your body well. How much your body can take, what is the extreme level of workload that it can afford.”
