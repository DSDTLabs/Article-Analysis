AHMEDABAD: After a lull in the demolition of the illegal six-storey   at Pakwan Crossroads, one of the owners of the building approached the   high   on Monday and affirmed that it will be his responsibility to pull the building down and remove debris from the site. He assured the court that this was not attempt to buy time. The building didn’t have parking and margin space as mandated by the Gujarat Town Planning Act. The owners had permission only for the ground floor but had begun building five other floors.

 The high court noted in an oral order on Monday: “The petitioners have categorically stated that the innocuous relief has been sought solely with a view to see that some material (debris including iron beams) can be saved, which may not be damaged in such a manner that it cannot be utilized. That is the sole idea behind seeking this permission.” 
 
 The petitioner sought eight weeks to salvage the building’s debris. Justice A   noted: “Learned senior advocate (representing the owners) even submitted an undertaking on oath and has assured the court that this is not a move by the petitioners to buy time .” The court further observed, “It has been clearly stated that till the entire construction of the building is put to ground zero, the petitioner will not utilize the plot in any manner.”
