PATNA: The   on Monday said if voted to power, it would free the 1.3 lakh people jailed for liquor law offences across the state.

 Calling the prohibition law ‘draconian’, RJD vice-president Shivanand   said at a press conference that the law was meant only to target people belonging to scheduled castes, backward castes and economically weaker sections of the society.
 
 “People ignorant of this law are being put behind bars and fined,” he regretted and added they should have been counselled first.
 
 Condemning CM   for first giving licences for liquor shops to open in every nook and corner of the state and then implementing a law against it, Tiwari said, “Once we return to power, we will study every individual case and do the needful to ensure their release.”
 
 The RJD neta hailed the coming together of Akhilesh Singh-led Samajwadi   and Mayawati-led   along with the   for the byelections in UP. “This is a good sign before the 2019 general election. Our party president Lalu Prasad had also been trying to bring the two together for long,” he said.
 
 Ridiculing former state Congress president Ashok Choudhary for joining the JD (U), Tiwari called him a ‘moth’, which gets attracted to ‘diya’ or light. “But Nitish is such a ‘diya’ which burns everyone coming close to it. He did the same to former assembly Speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary and former Banka MP Digvijay Singh. I am another such example,” Tiwari said.
