Greater Noida:   has ordered demolition of unauthorised structures inside the   in Sector 20 for flouting the approved map. The club management has been directed to remove the encroached part within a month and inform the authority.

 Greater Noida based-advocate   had complained to the Authority about the club management making unauthorised constructions in the parking area of the campus. Bhati said the management had got a map approved for the club. “They got permission for two gates but installed four gates on the premises. In the parking area, they have developed a store room and an office in the green area for which they had no permission,” he said. 
 
  On January 5, last year, GNIDA found unauthorised structures in the club during an inspection. The Authority then issued an order directing that the encroached area be cleared, but no action was taken. On May 8, 2018, Nimisha Sharma, deputy general manager (planning) GNIDA, issued a fresh order. “The store room, two gates, a room in the rear side, which were developed in addition to the approved map for the club, shall be demolished within a month, and the Authority informed,” Sharma said in the order. 
 
 Club manager   said he has not received a copy of the order. “I have no information about the recent order. We will take necessary action once we officially receive the information,” he said.
