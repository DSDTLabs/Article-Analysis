Jaipur: Before the department of IT and communication got the mandate for taking the   ecosystem in Rajasthan to the next level, Startup Oasis was the sole destination for aspiring entrepreneurs. But the joint venture between RIICO and the Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE), IIM Ahmedabad, is still supporting new initiatives.

 Chintan Bakshi, chief operating officer (COO) of Startup Oasis, said, “While the MoU with RIICO is valid till 2020, the period for getting some support as per the agreement is over. But Startup Oasis is taking up more and more initiatives to enhance the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the state.”
 
 In the INVENT programme (joint initiative of DFID, UK and India with Villgro as the lead incubator) Startup Oasis has incubated 23 social enterprises and invested Rs 3.25 crore in 15 of them so far.
 
 Some of the well-known startups that have gone through Startup Oasis programmes are Srjna, Jewelove, Legistify, InstaCash, HippoCabs, eStitch, Bijson Innovations, Onio India Seller Services, Tellmate and Sonant Technologies. It considers Razorpay Software and Thrillophillia as the two very successful startups that have been physically incubated at the centre.
 
 “We are providing support to early stage startups in seven cities of the state through an MoU with the department of technical education, Rajasthan, under the TEDSTART programme. Total startups supported under this programme are 415, while 12 startups have been incubated or accelerated. Similarly, we are supporting other institutions and incubators in the state to conduct entrepreneurship promotion and support activities.”
