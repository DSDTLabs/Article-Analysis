BATHINDA: Seeking complete loan waiver for farmers across the country, the Communist Party of India ( ) started a three-day ‘jail bharo’ protest on Monday. Party activists led by party national executive committee member   presented them for arrest  . The police declined to arrest them and took their memorandum. 

 Dayal said that, “The party is wholeheartedly supporting the farmers’ struggle for complete loan waiver and has decided to undertake ‘jail bharo’ protest across the country for three days. We started the protest from Bathinda and raised our voice for waiving the debt.”
 
 He said the CPI had put forward three more demands apart from loan waiver, which include implementation of the M S Swaminathan committee’s recommendations to ensure fair price for crops. “Swaminathan had recommended 50% profit over input costs. The CPI demands starting of social security scheme like pension of Rs 10,000 per month for farmers and farm labourers on attaining the age of 60, 10 marla (250 sq yards) plots to homeless farmers and farm labourers,” said Dayal.
 
 “Even though there is an act to limit land ownership, no government ever bothered to ensure that law was implemented properly as many persons keep benami land. The CPI wants that the government should take over land from those who own more land than the permissible limit in benami names and distribute it among farmers and farm labourers who have no land at all,” said CPI’s Bathinda unit head Surjit Singh Sohi.
