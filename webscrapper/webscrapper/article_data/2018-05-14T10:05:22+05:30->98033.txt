HYDERABAD: In an ambitious project, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ) will carry out digital house-numbering with aid from the  .

 
 A pilot project is being carried out in Moosapet to identify every house within GHMC limits with a unique number. The house-numbering system will have a direct impact on the city’s growth, as more property tax is likely to be collected once the uniform system is in place, said a GHMC official.
 
 In several areas, due to lack of proper house numbers, the civic body failed to achieve the expected property tax target.
 
 “To execute it in all the 26-lakh households in GHMC limits, the civic body has approached World Bank for a loan. The cost of the project is Rs 70 crore and the World Bank has asked us to submit expression of interest before May 30. Initially, we thought we will execute the project in a Public-Private partnership ( ) mode,” said  , GHMC director of house numbering cell.
 
 The civic body is geotagging the houses and integrating it with GHMC database. The houses will get a 14-digit number. Resident Welfare Associations said locating an address will become easier once the project is rolled out.
 
 “Loopholes such as door numbers not being in proper order will be sorted out and it will become easier to trace the location of a house,” said  , a resident of Alwal.
