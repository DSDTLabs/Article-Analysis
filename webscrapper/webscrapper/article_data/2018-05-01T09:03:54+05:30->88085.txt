CHANDIGARH: After forging an alliance, the   and the BSP will hold a joint meeting of their working committees in Kurukeshtra on Wednesday.

 Announcing this joint meet, INLD leader   also said that both parties would actively participate in the ‘jail bharo’ agitation beginning on Tuesday to press for the early completion of the SYL canal. He also said that from now onwards both parties would jointly push for the success of their agendas for social and economic justice.
 
 During the Wednesday meeting, both parties will also discuss in detail all aspects of the alliance and the challenges before   “in the light of the continued misgovernance of the Khattar government”. 
 
 Abhay said that, “The historic nature of the alliance is about to bring a revolutionary change in the politics of the state. Both parties are primarily champions of the rural classes, including farmers, Dalits and labourers working in industries and farms.”
 
 Abhay, who is also the leader of opposition, also said that both parties would jointly demand compensation for the wheat crop destroyed by fire in fields this season. 
 
 “Wheat worth crores of rupees has been lost to fire and farmers need to be compensated for these losses,” he said. Abhay further said that the INLD and BSP had always stood up to those who exploited the weak and the corrupt and communal forces. “It is because of the coming together of the INLD and BSP that both BJP and Congress feel threatened as they see their support base eroded,” he claimed.
