Have you found yourself gawking at cute elephant statues dotting Mumbai’s landscape? Believe it or not, these intricately-decorated elephants that have been appearing at different parts of the city early this month, have been designed by creative minds from various fields. 
The thought behind having a display of these Asian elephants is that they’re part of an art-based conservation project titled Elephant Parade, which aims to create an awareness campaign around the endangered Asian elephant. 
  
  
 Earlier, the exhibition travelled around the world to raise funds through the auction of these statues, which will help secure 101 elephant corridors across key regions in India to save the endangered species.
 The parade started in Jaipur, followed by Delhi and Kolkata, before it came to Mumbai. Here, it started from the Gateway of India and moved across the city, including Worli Sea Face, Bandra Fort, Carter Road as well as the malls in the Western suburbs. The display will be on till March 18. Made of fibre glass, these elephants have been designed by artists of all kinds — like painters, fashion designers, tribal artists, and even, actors, who gave vent to their imagination. 
 Since the idea behind exhibiting the elephants is to get the public involved, there are people who touch, feel, hug and even kiss these figures. “These statues are inspiring and I hope these colourful elephants find homes, which in the process, will help the cause of real elephants in India,” says Bharti Swami, a young professional.
 Accompanied by her parents, Surbhi (9) couldn’t stop hugging the elephants; she was happy to see that each of them had a name too. “When we have to write an essay about the interesting things that we did during our vacations, visiting these elephants will be a part of it. I will also go back home and draw my own elephant,” she says.
