GHAZIABAD: An anti-encroachment team that had gone to remove roadside encroachments in   had to face stiff resistance from the vendors leading to use of force to disperse the vendors. 

 Later, after hectic parleys with the administration, the matter was resolved and the administration agreed to give them some time to clear the encroachments. “We had started our day when a posse of policemen along with officials from the district administration reached the spot with earthmovers to clear what they called  ,” said Bijender Yadav, a vendor. “In no time, hundreds of vendors gathered on the spot and opposed the drive. However, the matter was resolved after our representatives held discussions with the administration,” said Yadav.
 
 Traders alleged that the administration moved in without informing them. “There are cemented platforms built all over the mandi and some traders have put tin sheets over it. The administration says it tantamounts to encroachment,” said Hazi Shaubudin, a trader. “The truth is that we had sent a proposal to the government wherein we have asked them to build shades so that we could stock our perishable goods. However, while the proposal was being considered, the administration almost unilaterally acted to remove the encroachment,” said Shaubudin. 
 
 “For now, the drive has been postponed and on Tuesday, we will meet the DM to apprise her of our point of view,” said Shaubudin. Himanshu Gautam, ADM (city), said: “We have been getting complaints as the tin shed erected outside shops were causing inconvenience and so an anti-encroachment drive was warranted.”
