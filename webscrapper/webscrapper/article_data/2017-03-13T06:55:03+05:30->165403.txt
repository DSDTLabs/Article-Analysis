HYDERABAD: At a time when everyone is busy filing   and making investments to save few bucks, there are one set of people who have no clue whatsoever on how to go forward, and they are the first time tax assesses. 

 While the procedure of submitting tax memos seems simple to the seasoned employees, for people who are into their first-year of the job, find themselves stuck in between various   sections which one cannot understand.
 
 "Initially when I got a mail from my  , I had no clue how it works. Later, couple of my colleagues helped me out with the formalities, " said Deepa Reddy, a techie.
 
 Another fresher, Sai Krishna, said that he was caught off guard when he got a message from the   department. "As I joined in December last year, I thought all these tax memos are not applicable to me. However, a few days back, I was asked to submit my   details. At that point I started researching on investment options and eventually took an insurance policy," said Krishna.
 
 On the other hand, experts said that the key to handling this problem is in understanding of salary structure and responding to tax memo.
 
 "Never ignore tax memos and always respond to the requirements that finance team is sending out. Also, all the employees should have a basic understanding of their salary, especially on the components-which are taxable and which or not. If required, they should reach out to the finance team and try to get a clear idea," said Samir Sabharwal, head of finance, CDK Global India.
 
 He said that employees should make an investment by the first half of March so that it would be reflected in this year's tax memo.
 
 "If the investments are made in the later part of March, it would be a problem and some finance teams might not agree to show this in this year's investment column," said Sabharwal and added that most of the employees ignore applying for the PAN (Permanent Account Number) card till last moment although it is a simple and mandatory process.
