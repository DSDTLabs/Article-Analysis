 Twitter Audit is an external tool not affiliated to Twitter, that takes a sample 5,000 Twitter followers and assesses them on the number of tweets, followers, mutual follows and other parameters. It uses these to determine whether an account is fake or real. “Of course, this scoring method is not perfect but it is a good way to tell if someone with lots of followers is likely to have increased their follower count by inorganic, fraudulent, or dishonest means,” says the Twitter Audit website.
 
 The audits of several Indian accounts that TOI checked on the website were updated months ago. The time they were last audited is indicated in the graphic. The total number of current followers are as seen on Twitter.com on March 13.
