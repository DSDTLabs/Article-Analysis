NEW DELHI: A day after Sabrina Lall, sister of  , said she had forgiven   given the prison term already served and his social work, the mother of   and families of Uphaar tragedy victims said letting him off would set a bad precedent. 

 “How does the government know that he has reformed? Running an NGO does not mean he has reformed. There is a court of law that has punished him for his crime; pardon by a family member does not nullify the rule of law,” said  , Nitish’s mother who fought a long battle to bring the killers of her son to book. 
 
 Katara has demanded an investigation into Sharma’s role in helping his family members set up a restaurant opposite  . “Some websites and channels had reported that Sharma was seen at the hotel a few times earlier. How does he manage to step out of jail so many times?” she said. 
 
 Katara said Sharma’s conviction had given hope to many. 
 
 “It takes a lot for a parent to stand up against a system and fight for justice for a child who has been killed. I don’t know what was going through Sabrina’s mind when she pardoned him. But it is not only her; the crime was against the state,” said Neelam Krishnamurthy of the association of victim families of the Uphaar tragedy.
 
 Krishnamurthy added that it would be a huge letdown if Sharma is let off.
