AMRITSAR: The body of a security guard of Congress candidate for the Amritsar   bypoll Gurjit Singh Aujla was found with bullet marks on Thursday. Police said head constable Narinder Singh’s body was found, just a few yards away from Aujla’s house.

 “Apparently, it is a case of suicide. The guard has committed suicide with his own weapon,” Amritsar commissioner of police Nageshwar Rao said. Police are investigating into the incident, he added.
 
 Aujla said Narinder had told his colleagues that he was under heavy debt. Meanwhile, BJP’s Lok Sabha bypoll candidate Rajinder   Chhina condemned the incident and demanded a high-level probe into the death of Aujla’s guard.
 
 “It is a cold blooded murder, which needs to be investigated at the highest level,” said Chhina, adding that police should provide adequate security cover to Aujla. On the other hand, Aujla had warned his political opponents to not politicize the issue.
