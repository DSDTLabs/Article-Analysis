 Mankotia said that the party had not issued any show cause notice against him so far. "I had read the reports that the Congress is going to issue a notice. But nothing has been done so far.

 The former minister added he had decided to fight upcoming assembly polls. When asked that whether he will fight on a Congress ticket, if granted, he said: "It is sure that I will contest poll. But regarding a Congress ticket, that would be the choice of the people with me." Sources said detractors of Singh in congress party are also protecting Mankotia to take political mileage. Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, HPCC president however evaded the queries. "I will respond you later on this issue" he said in an evasive reply.
