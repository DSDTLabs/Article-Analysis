Coimbatore: The city will soon get a mass rapid transport system if what the commissioner of municipal administration G Prakash has said is to go by. But confusions reign on it being a bus rapid transit system or a metro rail project.

 A month after the minister for municipal administration minister S P Velumani said that the city will get a metro rail project, Prakash sought the expertise from the Indo-German Smart Initiative (IGSI) for a proposal to provide BRTS in the city. However, he did not rule out the metro rail project. “Mono-rail or metro rail may not be viable because the state may have to cross-subsidize in the long run as it cannot be sustained and will run in loss. Unless there is viability and a report in place, it will be difficult. However for a BRTS, it will only take Rs15-20 crore to implement it. But we have discussed this and we are planning to present this to the government once we have a conclusive idea on the  ,” he said. 
 
 But some industrialists in the city said that with more than 20,000 vehicles being registered every month, it is very difficult for a BRTS to work. 
 
 Corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said that they plan to implement the BRTS at Avinashi Road, Sathy Road and Trichy Road. Prakash asked the German experts to give a commitment on when they will submit a report on the BRTS system. “We want the German experts to submit a detailed project report on the BRTS system,” he said.
