Panaji: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has written to governor Mridula Sinha urging her to ensure that the government identifies and arrests the culprits behind the desecration of religious structures in the state. A delegation of NCP leaders met Sinha and director general of police (DGP) Muktesh Chander on Wednesday. “The party demands that the governor should direct the state government to take prompt and stern action against the miscreants who are indulging in disturbing the peace and communal harmony in the state (sic),” NCP Goa state president Jose Philip D’Souza, said. Slamming the police, the party said miscreants were taking advantage of the “lethargy of the police and intelligence agencies” who had taken “no concrete and resilient” steps to nab the culprits.
