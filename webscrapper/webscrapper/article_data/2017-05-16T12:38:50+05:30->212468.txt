AMRITSAR: Family members of   martyr   were allegedly assaulted by a   and his associates in Gurdaspur on May 13 over work visa. Kulwant of the Defence Service Corps (DSC) had sacrificed his life during the attack on the Pathankot   in January 2016.

 On Saturday, Kulwant's younger brother Hardeep Singh and sister-in-law Kulwinder Kaur were allegedly beaten up by travel agent Gurnam Singh after they asked him to return their money. Hardeep and his wife Kulwinder were thrashed in an area falling under Bhaini Mian Khan police station on May 13.
 
 With a CCTV footage of the incident going viral on the social media,   on Monday submitted a detailed report to the chief minister on the incident. Local police said that a case has been registered against 11 persons, including women, and manhunt launched to arrest accused who are on the run.
 
 Agent Gurnam had taken Rs 9 lakh from Hardeep and promised to send him to France on a work visa, along with his wife. The travel agent had promised to send Hardip to France but he was sent instead to Indonesia. From there too, he was deported to India. Upon his return, Hardip confronted the travel agent to return the money.
 
 Even after a year, Hardeep couldn't get the desired visa or the money back. When he asked Gurnam to give back his money, the latter asked for some more time. Despite repeated attempts, the money was not repaid to Hardeep. The matter was even brought to the notice of the local panchayat, after which Gurnam returned Rs 3.40 lakh and promised to pay the remaining amount soon.
 
 When Hardeep did not receive the remaining amount, he lodged a complaint with the police. When Gurnam learnt about the police complaint against him, he allegedly assaulted the martyr's brother. Bhaini Mian Khan police station in charge Vijay Kumar said that, “The accused are on the run but will be arrested soon.“
