 This year, however, diabetic students appearing for the exams commencing on March 5 were asked to apply for the concession through an application form pertaining to students with physical disabilities. On Tuesday, CBSE spokesperson Rama Sharma refuted this and said no changes had been made in the concession process and no instructions were sent to school indicating any change in the guidelines.
 
 “The rules remain the same. The students seeking concession for Type 1 diabetes need to follow the circular issued last year,” Sharma reiterated. An official said that the confusion had arisen after some schools asked their diabetic students to fill up the wrong concession form. According to the 2017 circular, a diabetic student was required to submit a certificate from a diabetic specialist along with details of the individual’s full diabetic history, nature of diabetes and the requirements for snacks during examination.

 Dr Ashok Jhingan, chairperson of Delhi Diabetes Research Centre, said that in order to avoid any confusion in the future, the education board should create a separate category to allow for “specific reasonable concessions” for diabetics and have a standard format for all schools to follow.
