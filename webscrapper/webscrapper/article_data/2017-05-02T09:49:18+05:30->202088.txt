MUMBAI: The city crime branch has arrested two people for breaking into   where they earlier worked. Tools used for   and Rs 6.5 lakh in cash were recovered from the accused, Santosh Roshan Nayak (22) and Paresh Soren (23). 

 The case came to light after a burglary at Carter's Blue on Carter Road, Bandra, on April 15. The restaurant's owner registered a complaint that Rs 9.5 lakh had been stolen. The burglars had entered the eatery from the backdoor, which only few people, including the restaurant's employees, knew of.
 
 "From the way the accused had broken into the eatery from the kitchen, it was obvious that it was an insider's job. Hence we started focussing on the restaurant's list of employees and ex-employees. Finally we came across these two characters, who were missing," said deputy commissioner of police Shashikant Narayan Satav.
 
 The crime branch's unit 9, led by Mahesh Desai and assistant inspector Nitin Patil, on specific information, arrested Soren and Nayak. "During the course of interrogation, they admitted not only to the burglary on Carter Road, but also at 19 other places, including five pubs and hotels where they worked as captain (a restaurant position) and bar attendant," said Patil. Taste 'N' Trip in Malad (west) and Trisom Pub in Versova were among places where they worked as waiters.
 
 Their modus operandi was simple. Join a place, study it, quit and then return in the dead of night to burgle it. The accused told the police they spent the booty partying.
