 CHENNAI: At the funeral for  , one of the youths who drowned at the waterfalls near Tada, his friends turned violent and attacked Kamesh, Rajarao and   — the men with whom   went on the trip. The trio, who were let off by the police after questioning on Monday, had come to Yaswanth’s house in   near Kolathur to pay their respects to their friend on Tuesday evening.
 
 On learning that Yaswanth’s body arrived at his house at 4.30pm, the three friends went over to pay their respects. However, angry friends of Yaswanth prevented them from seeing the body and picked up a quarrel. Some even accused the three men of taking Yashwanth to Tada with the intention of killing him.
 
 
 The quarrel was put to rest by some elderly persons who pacified Yashwanth’s angry friends. Personnel from the Kolathur police station quickly arrived to diffuse the tension and maintain peace.
 
 “Yaswanth was always ready to help us and he kept us his first priority,” his friend Sai told TOI.
 
 Thanikachalam Nagar was in mourning when Yaswanth’s body arrived from   on Tuesday. His parents reportedly fainted at the sight of their son’s body when it arrived from the hospital. A part of Thanikachalam Nagar was blocked due to the huge number of people visiting Yashwanth’s home. Police said the victim, who was studying in an engineering college, got stuck in the sludge and drowned.
