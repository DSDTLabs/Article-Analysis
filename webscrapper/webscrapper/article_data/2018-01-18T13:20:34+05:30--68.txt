NAGPUR: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president   has announced his party would organize ‘Save Constitution’ rallies in Mumbai and every district headquarter in the state on Republic Day. He said all opposition parties would be invited to join the rallies.

 The decision was taken at a meeting on Tuesday at   in Mumbai, where several senior party leaders were present. “The leaders of the ruling party at the Centre and the state have been openly talking of changing the Constitution to suit their agenda. To oppose this dangerous move, the Congress has taken the initiative to alert the people through public rallies,” Chavan told reporters after the meeting.
 
 Meanwhile, the ruling   (BJP) has also decided to counter the Congress move by organizing its own ‘Tricolour rally’, in which they will renew the pledge to protect and follow the country’s Constitution. A meeting of district presidents from all over the state was held in Mumbai on Wednesday to finalize the BJP’s programme.
 
 “The Congress is creating a bogey of threat to Constitution as a gimmick to attract attention. But the BJP will tell people on that day that our party accords highest respect to the Constitution, and we will always go by it to strengthen the nation,” said party spokesman and MLA Girish Vyas. BJP workers in each district will take out rallies and hoist the national flag at all prominent places, he added.
 
 Ridiculing the BJP’s counter rallies, Chavan said the BJP should be aware that its parent organization RSS has shown scant respect for the Tricolour, as it considers three colours on the national flag inauspicious and wants a single colour only. “For years, RSS refrained from hoisting the tricolour at its headquarters in Nagpur. It’s laughable that these people are now feigning love for the Tricolour,” said Chavan.
