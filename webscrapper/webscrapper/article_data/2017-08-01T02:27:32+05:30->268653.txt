NEW DELHI: Residents of   near   are seeking  . The reason: three of the womenfolk, trying to sleep off splitting headaches, have woken up to find their  . While police have registered three separate FIRs, the villagers are convinced that a “supernatural being” is behind their troubles. 

 Villagers claim of having heard similar stories from Gurgaon. In fact, at least 15 incidents of women’s braids being mysteriously chopped off have been reported from villages of the Mewat region in last two weeks. Police, on the other hand, feel it’s likely a prank. 
 
 Among the first “victims” is a 58-year-old woman: she claimed to have developed a severe headache in the evening, “as if someone was tugging at my hair”. Her son told TOI: “I gave my mother some medicine and asked her to try and sleep. However, when after half an hour I went to check on her, I found her lying on the floor with her braids chopped.” 
 
 The woman said she knew nothing about what had happened after she went to sleep. “While I was walking home, I felt someone was trying to pull my hair. I had a terrible headache. When I woke up, I found that my hair had been chopped off,” she said. 
 
 A neighbour said that when he read about similar incidents in Gurgaon, he had laughed them off. “However, we don’t know how to react now. All if us are quite afraid right now,” he said.
 
 Another woman claimed that they were now staying indoors out of fear. The villagers have hung charms outside their houses in form of chillies and lemons and imprinted henna on walls to ward off evil spirits. 
 
 DCP (southwest) Surender Kumar said they had registered three separate FIRs under various sections of IPC and were looking into the cases.
