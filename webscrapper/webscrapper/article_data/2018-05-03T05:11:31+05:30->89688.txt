AHMEDABAD: A   between managements of private   and government officials will be held on Thursday. The meeting is likely to be chaired by chief minister Vijay  .

 The Supreme Court had in April directed the Gujarat government and the managements of private schools to jointly thresh out a scheme to fix a percentage of fees as profit that can be generated by schools. The SC also ordered that private schools use the profits only to meet the objectives of the trust/society, for development of educational activities.
 
 Sources in the government said the meeting will be held at the CM’s residence and two representatives of private schools from each of the four zones of the state have been called. The government has ensured that all stakeholders — including parents’ associations that have been agitating and have even filed a plea in the Supreme court to be joined in the litigation as party — have been invited to the meeting.
 
 Sources said the meeting will deal with what the formula should be for fixing the proportion of profits for the trust and to fix fees for the extra curriculum activities that several schools offer.
 
 Office bearers of an association of school managements said that while hearing appeals against the Gujarat government’s   law, the apex court had asked both parties to prepare a scheme jointly and submit it to the court before the second week of July.
 
 The association said that this meeting will be followed by a second meeting, where both parties will present their own formulas and once one is mutually agreed on, it will be presented in the SC.
 
 Sources in school managements said that with a new formula to be decided, the entire exercise of fixing provisional fees for some 500 schools will have to be done again, as managements whose fees have been set will also want to readjust theirs with a proportion of profit.
