Bollywood beauty   has been on the top of her fashion game, ever since she made her debut in the film industry. The young diva is carving a niche in the industry through her movies and captivating photos online. There's no denying that she's winning everyone's hearts through her social media game. 

 
 She might be a newbie in Bollywood, but her glam avatar is already making waves. Be it her dance moves or stunning off-screen appearances, she is one star to watch out for. Recently, the actress was spotted at the premiere of Judwaa 2 where she was seen sizzling in a jumpsuit. She stepped out in a grey coloured jumpsuit. The almost-blackless jumpsuit was supported by two tiny straps at the back. 
 
 
 
  
 She styled this satin number with only a pair of earrings. And, when it came to her make-up, she sported glossy pink lips and the classic wing eye. We also like her side-swept hairdo which complemented the deep neckline.
