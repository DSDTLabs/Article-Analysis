PUNE: The “Buddy Cop” system, launched by the city police for the safety of working women in IT parks at Hinjewadi and Kharadi, will be extended to   from July.

 The system was introduced in the wake of two cases of murders of software engineers — Antara Das on December 23 last year, and Rasila Raju OP on January 29 this year.
 
 Pune Police commissioner Rashmi   told TOI, “The system has so far delivered desired results for women working in IT parks in Hinejwadi and Kharadi. We have received feedbacks that they are now feeling safe, hence we have decided to extend this system to college girls too.”
 
 Shukla, who has been presented with the ‘FICCI Smart Policing Award 2017’ for her initiatives, said, “At present, every police station has assigned some constables to be a part of the system and run it smoothly. They are in constant touch with working women who are registered as members under the scheme and are delivering positive results.”
 
 Under the system, cellphone numbers of buddy cops are provided to women employees with whom they can discuss issues related to their safety. 
 
 Shukla said, “I have had discussions with various working professionals and have come to know that they are now comfortable with registering complaints. This is a positive sign.”
 
 Meanwhile, sections of the senior police officers are of the opinion that this move will help in resolving college campus issues where crime likes eve teasing can be resolved effectively.
