CHANDIGARH: Factory owners from the Industrialists Area Phase I are upset that while they expected the municipal corporation to stop dumping cow dung in their front yard, it has started with planning a biogas plant project instead on this plot. 

 
 The MC has also started building the boundary wall of its cattle pound in the area and paving it with tiles. For almost a year now, the local manufacturers have been opposing the dumping of animal waste behind plots 701 to 709, on the lane opposite the cattle pound. The air carries the stink of the dung, and last year when the factory owners complained to the-then mayor  , during her visit to the area, she promised them a park on the site so that it could be rid of dung.
 
 Workers of the cattle pound continue to dispose of all the dung at this convenience spot nearby. Heaps of dung have built up and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which had made a lot of factory workers ill last year. The factory owners said they were surprised to know that the MC had decided to build a biogas plant in the dumping zone on the request of area councillor Shakti  .
 
 One of the factor owners,  , wrote to the municipal commissioner that the   would increase after the coming up of the biogas plant and it would be "a new headache" for the companies. "The dumping in front of the units is on since 2003," he said. "Last year, two of my workers were down with dengue fever because of it."
 
 Councillor Devshali said: "After the wall is ready, we will study the feasibility of a biogas plant on that site. The plant worth Rs 9.5 lakh will have 250 square feets of boundary wall and tiles over 270 sq m. The money will come from my ward development fund."
