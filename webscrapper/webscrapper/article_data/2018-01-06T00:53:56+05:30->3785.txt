GURUGRAM: Haryana director general of police ( ) on Thursday instructed cops not to set up nakas individually to check   but to conduct such drives only as part of a team after taking permission from a relevant authority. 

 DGP   held a meeting with cops from across the state on Thursday. 
 
 His instructions come after the state transport department notified the Haryana Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Rules, 2018. Section 213 of the rules have specified police officers who can take part in checks on overloaded vehicles. 
 
 The move aims to check illegal   in a systemic manner as the noose around vehicles transporting stones, minerals and sand from the Aravalis tightens. The officers concerned can issue challans in areas within a radius of five kilometres from mining or crushing zones as notified by the mines and geology department. 
 
 In Gurgaon, areas around the three crushing zones, Naurangpur, Gwal Pahari and Raisina, have been identified as vulnerable. Check posts by the joint teams will be set up around these three areas and their locations will also be changed on a random basis.
 
 “We are following the rules and the task is to be executed only by the joint police teams. Cops will only be a part of the checks when the special teams need their help and after senior officials give them permission to join the teams. This will help bring transparency in the system and make the joint operation against overloaded vehicles more effective,” BS Sandhu told TOI.
