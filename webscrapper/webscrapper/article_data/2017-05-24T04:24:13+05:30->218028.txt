MUMBAI: It was a ticking parking tab and Ariana’s Grande’s pre-published concert song menu that perhaps helped  , a 41-year-old Indian woman, and her 13-year-old daughter Shreya and friend   make a narrow and almost providential escape from the ghastly terror attack on Monday night. 

 Still reeling from a chilling reminder of the explosions that shattered the night barely seven minutes after they left, Pathak, who hails from Jaipur, recounted her experience to TOI. 
 
 “I usually park some place about a seven-minute walk from the arena to avoid the rush once a show ends. Since Ariana’s set list was available, we timed our exit before the third last song,” recounted Pathak, who lives in Altrincham, about eight miles from the arena. 
 
 “We started walking out at 10.20pm and passed through the foyer at 10.23pm, the exact spot where the blasts took place at 10.30. I know this because I constantly had my eye on the watch as my 3-hour parking ticket was running out and I was trying to avoid paying the extra £3. Since the parking was two storeys underground, I couldn’t hear any explosion nor see any commotion,” Pathak, a physician, said.
 
 On the way out, she saw ambulances rushing in but couldn’t tell why until they got home by 11 pm and got the tragic news.
