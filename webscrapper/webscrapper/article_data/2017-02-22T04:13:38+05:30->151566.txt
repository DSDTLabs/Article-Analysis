SURAT: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has developed a software application which will help it keep track of projects, their viability and feasibility, land availability and court cases. The need of software application rose because for the past few years, the civic body has failed to fully utilize its allocation for capital works in the budget. The budget for 2016-17 had made an allocation of Rs 2,800 crore for capital works, but the fear is by March-end only Rs 1,800 crore would have been expended. This is why municipal commissioner M   has decided to conduct weekly review meetings for all new 45 projects worth Rs 1 crore listed for the year 2017-18. And this software application will come handy when SMC plans to spend maximum money on capital expenditure in the budget for 2017-18.

 M Thennarasan said, “We now have a software which helps us to know viability, feasibility, land availability, court cases, etc., about a project. The exact status on ground will make it easy for us to have a timetable with regard to implementation and completion of a project.” 
 
 Construction of   three years ago is a classic example. It got embroiled in a legal tangle which led to scrapping of the project this year. The plan to build a business hub at   for diamond and textile sectors too has been scrapped as it has been found to be impracticable after eight years.
 
 “A weekly review meeting would give us a proper idea about the problems that a project may be facing. Timely resolution of the problems will help us maintain the schedule,” Thennarasan added.
