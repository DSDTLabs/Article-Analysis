We would launch protests at district, block and gram panchayat level to expose how the Centre works to help the   government for political gains," said a BJD insider. 

 The party may also take up the Mahanadi battle to the national capital in the post-monsoon period.
 
 A number of senior BJD leaders hit out at both Chhattisgarh and the Centre over the Mahanadi issue.   member  , who recently joined the ruling party, took a dig at Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, saying he must prove that the state is more important to him than the party. "I am ready to quit the Rajya Sabha post for him if he agrees to take up the issue in Parliament," Soumya said.
 
 Refuting Naveen's charges, BJP vice-president Sameer Mohanty said it was unfortunate that the chief minister blamed BJP for obstructing the flow of Mahanadi. "The ruling party is resorting to drama as people of the state have already understood the inability of the state government to protect Odisha's interests over the Mahanadi issue," Mohanty said.
 
 Meanwhile, newly-elected Congress president Niranjan Patnaik also vowed that his party would fight against the Centre's alleged injustice on the Mahanadi water-sharing dispute. At a news conference here, Niranjan also targeted the state government's 'inefficiency' in handling the issue.
