CHENNAI: Convinced that the online-only mode of counselling for   ( ) 2018 will not result in any deprivation of opportunity to eligible students, particularly those from rural areas, the Madras high court on Thursday said it was not inclined to direct   to continue physical submission of applications also. 

 "It is actually more beneficial to the applicants by virtue of the decentralisation of the process and enabling the facility of undergoing admission process in a transparent manner without the requirement to travel to Chennai from different places across the state," a division bench of   and Justice   said. As to the difficulties faced by students from rural areas in the mode of payment of registration fee, the university submitted that payment of registration fee through demand draft in addition to online modes would also be made available from May 18.
 
 The university assured the court that trained personnel would be available at the TNEA facilitation centres to assist candidate. 
 
 Recording the submissions, the bench posted the pleas to June 8 for filing compliance report.
