MADURAI:   should position themselves in the industry, brand their products and also try to produce as per demand, Madurai collector K   has said.

 Speaking at the weaver awareness ( ) programme organised here on Friday, he said that there were numerous schemes to benefit weavers and they should utilise them by attending such programmes and interacting with concerned officials.
 
 He said that Rs1.54 crore had been given as loans to 309 farmers in 2016-2017 under the Pradhan Mantiri Mudra Yojna. 
 
 With a target to disburse loans to 500 weavers in 2017-2018, so far 438 have received Rs 50,000 each amounting to Rs2.19 crore.
 
 There are a total of 4,824 weavers in the district including 1,657 society weavers and 3,167 private weavers. Ninety-five weavers were given solar powered green houses at a cost of Rs2.47 crore. There were also insurance benefits for weavers.
 
 The collector said that private weavers could also avail the 10% subsidy provided to society members for yarn and silk threats by the central government.
 
  They would have to purchase the yarn by making the payment through a specified account number and later the subsidy would be credited to their accounts, as has been done for LPG gas subsidy.
 
 Weavers showcased their products including saris, shirts, dhoties, bedspreads and towels at the venue. Assistant director for handlooms S Syed Dawood, Lead Bank manager M Irulappan among others were present
