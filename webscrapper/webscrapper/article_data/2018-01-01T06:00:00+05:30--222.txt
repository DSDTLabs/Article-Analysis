It was a double celebration as couples Anchal and   and   and   threw a joint bash to celebrate their wedding anniversaries. The theme for the party being white, mana   turned up dressed in their ‘whitest’ best, acing to the dress code with aplomb. As a band belted out numbers of different genres, the guests posed for shutterbugs while chatting with each other. And if that wasn’t fun enough, the revellers danced the evening away, taking a break only to sip on the yummy drinks and sample the delish Italian and Indian dishes.
