MADURAI: The   (GRH) in Madurai, which treats more than 10,000 outpatients and 2,500 in patients on a daily basis, became the first government hospital in south   to have a ‘Quiet Suite and automation technology MRI’ (1.5T  ) machine installed on its premises on Wednesday. 
 
 MRI scans can be performed for brain, spine and orthopaedic examinations with this machine. The state-of-the-art technology reduces noise up to 97% during the  , compared to any of the conventional MRI scanners. This would be highly beneficial to patients since this gives them high comfort inside the MRI scanners. This is especially beneficial to paediatric and neonate patients and may help avoid sedations in certain cases. 
  
 Today’s world is moving fast towards artificial intelligence based technologies. The MRI scanner installed at the GRH has dot technology which is artificial intelligence-based automation technology and is available for brain, spine, knee, shoulder and hip joints. This would help the institution performing scans faster and improving the turnaround time. 
  
 “With Quite Suite and Dot technologies, scans will now be faster and quieter, resulting in patients spending lesser time inside the MRI machine, thus improving patient experience,” head of MRI business at Siemens Healthineers, India, V B Singaravelu said. 
  
 “We are confident that this MRI scanner will enable us to enhance and extend the clinical advantages to all the deserving patients across communities in South Tamil Nadu,” said Dr  , dean, GRH.
