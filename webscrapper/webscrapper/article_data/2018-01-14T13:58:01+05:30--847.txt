BHOPAL: Over 81,000   made it to the Centre last year till November — averaging 250 complaints a day and putting the state sixth on the all-India chart.

 
 The complaints were filed with the Central Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) — a centralised portal to receive public complaints against various government organisations regarding state-run schemes and pension-related matters.
 
 In response to a question raised in Lok Sabha, MoS in the Prime Minister’s Office   said that 81,275 grievances were received from MP in 2017 (till November). This was a rise of 250% over 2015, when 32,000 complaints were filed.
 
 Uttar Pradesh tops the charts with a whopping 3,00,632 grievances, followed by Maharashtra (1,81,560), Delhi (1,65,310), Rajasthan (91,926) and Karnataka (88,074) . Four of the six states with the highest number of grievances are ruled by  .
 
 The sharp rise in number of grievances, if seen as a barometer of dissatisfaction among public, is a challenge for the three-term government in election year. What’s more, it puts a question mark on the implementation of Public Services Guarantee Act, 2010 — MP was the first state to introduce it. The Act ensures delivery of timebound services to public, and allows for fining officials in case of a delay.
 
 The silver lining is that 76% of the complaints — some 61,821 — were disposed of. CPGRAMS is a platform that enables submission of grievances by aggrieved citizens, 24x7, from anywhere.
 
 
 
 Complaints received in the department of administrative reforms and public grievances are forwarded after scrutiny by ministries and departments concerned and other organizations of government for action.
 
 Initially, only a few services like issuance of birth and death certificates, domicile certificates and Khasra copies were included. The number of services has since increased to 400 under the Public Service Guarantee Act.
 
 Over 4.77 crore complaints have been disposed nationwide, and 4.57 lakh are pending.
