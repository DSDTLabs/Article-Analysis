KOLKATA: While the rest of the city is relieved after a preliminary tests on alleged ‘plastic’   samples turned out negative, one woman is suddenly in a spot of bother.

 Anita Kumar, the 37-year-old homemaker, had lodged a police complaint last week against a   egg retailer alleging the man had sold her fake eggs that had a strange “plastic-like quality”. She had claimed her family had fallen sick after consuming the eggs. Acting on her complaint, police had arrested the retailer. But preliminary test reports suggesting that the eggs were genuine and chief minister   hinting at a counter investigation to find out why such rumours were spread, Kumar now fears being hounded by the police and summoned for interrogation.
 
 “I am a simple housewife and had lodged a complaint only after I thought that the eggs were fishy. I had no personal vendetta against the egg seller. Nor did I have any intention to spread rumour. I am happy that the tests have come negative,” she told TOI over phone.
 
 On being asked why had she burnt egg shells in front of TV cameras, she said, she had seen the shell melt just like plastic when a piece had accidentally dropped on the frying pan. It is only thereafter that she had tried to burn the shell to check how it had happened, she said. “I just wanted to see what happens if the shells were held against fire. I had no bad intention,” she insisted.
 
 The   resident who had hogged the limelight a week ago is now shy of facing the camera. “I did what I thought was right. Now that I have been proved wrong, I am happy and I don’t want to discuss it any further,” she said.
 
 Cops probing into the case said they had no immediate instruction or requirement to cross-examine the woman. “The enforcement branch is looking into the case. We have no immediate need to interrogate her,” said an officer of Karaya police station, where the FIR was registered on March 30.
