NAGPUR: Some   activists and advocate Satish Uke have demanded to the state election commission (SEC) and divisional commissioner Anup Kumar to transfer district collector   out of the district during the election period, citing that the IAS officer is a city resident.

 He was posted in Uttarakhand cadre as IAS officer. He came to the state cadre on deputation of five years on December 17, 2014. 
 
 Uke, in the complaint, said that Kurve’s transfer was necessary to ensure fair conduct of   (NMC), teachers constituency,   and Panchayat Samiti elections. “Kurve is originally from the city and also completed his education here,” Uke contended. “The collector is the district election officer and also district magistrate so he plays will handle various responsibilities in these elections. He was part of NMC’s wards delimitation. He is responsible for voters list for NMC elections. ZP and Panchayat Samiti elections will be held soon. Therefore, he should be transferred for elections’ time period,” he said.
 
 Uke added that process related to all these elections also displayed on the collector office website. “He being a district magistrate has powers of law and order of the district. Therefore, he should have been transferred when municipal council elections were announced,” he said.
 
 The Congress activists, led by  , also met Anup Kumar over the issue.
 
 Kumar said the demands were not legitimate. “Uke and Congress activists met me and submitted a copy of the complaint sent to the SEC. Norms say a local official should not be a returning officer in election. Kurve is not a returning officer in NMC or ZP/PS elections. This issue would have come for discussion had it been Lok Sabha or assembly elections in which collector is election officer. Kurve has been beneficial for the district with his innovative projects. Government and people are happy with Kurve’s works,” he said.
