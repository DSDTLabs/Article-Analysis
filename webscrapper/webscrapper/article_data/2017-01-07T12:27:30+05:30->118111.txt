PANAJI: More than three years after defence minister   promised to supply water to the Verna industrial estate, the promise remains a pipe-dream for over 300 companies that operate in the  . The estate requires 10 million litres of water per day, a demand presently met by a combination of water tankers and bore wells. Industrialists are worried that the groundwater table could dry out in the next two months.

 “We reviewed the situation last week and set a target to commission water supply to the industrial estate by the first week of March. Two reservoirs are under construction and should be ready soon. The 11KV electrical line remains,” general manager for engineering at the   (GIDC), Vijay Kumar, said.
 
 The estate includes some major pharmaceutical companies, which have invested in their own water treatment plants and bore wells to tide over the crisis.
 
 “We can see the water, but it does not reach the units. Now, they (authorities concerned) say the   should be ready by next month,”   president Damodar Kochkar said.
 
 When contacted, GIDC officials said that their managing director Umeshchandra Joshi was on leave and argued that the initiation of water supply to the industrial estate suffered a setback when general manager for engineering, Prakash Gurav, was relieved and replaced by Kumar. 
 
 Incidentally, Kumar has now been put on election duty.
 
 Although a pipeline for raw water was constructed from Nessai to the estate, water was never supplied to the industries. The GIDC later constructed a sump tank, following which it altered its plans and shifted the sump to another height. 
 
 The corporation now intends to distribute water through pipelines with the help of gravity, which requires a sump, a water purification plant, pipelines and a pump-house. Strangely, however, it has floated tenders only for the pump-house and the pipeline.
