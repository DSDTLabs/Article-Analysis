BENGALURU: Former Kerala chief minister   on Monday appeared before a   in connection with the   cheating case. The senior   leader filed an affidavit/examination-in-chief before the court denying the allegations against him in the case filed by M K Kuruvilla. 

 Additional city civil and sessions court Judge N R Channakeshava directed Chandy to appear again on January 9 for cross-examination. This was after the counsel for plaintiff sought time to study the affidavit. However, Joseph Anthony, counsel for Chandy, said an advance copy had been served on the counsel for plaintiff and thus request for an adjournment only a delaying tactic.
 
  In his affidavit, Chandy said that he has been arrayed as a defendant in the suit "unnecessarily, mischievously and only with a fraudulent intent to defame" him even though he had no connection with the alleged business transaction. He said the suit was filed to vilify and damage his reputation. 
 
 "I don't know anything about the other defendants with whom Kuruvilla wanted to do business. I further state that although no amount was paid to me, the respondent has misled this court and has obtained the ex-parte judgment behind my back," Chandy said in reference to the October 24, 2016 decree passed by the court in which it directed six people, including Chandy, to together pay Rs 1.6 crore to Kuruvilla with 12% interest.
 
 He stated that but for the unfortunate communication gap between the advocate representing him in Bengaluru and himself, a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, he would not have missed any opportunity to counter the allegations.
 
 M K Kuruvilla filed the suit in March 2016, seeking return of Rs 1.6 crore deposited with SCOSSA Educational Consultants Private Limited for a solar power project, which failed to materialize, in Kerala.
