NEW DELHI: The expenditure finance committee of the   has cleared five bus depots to create room for parking of 895 buses. Also, 2,579 new beds would be added to seven hospitals. The financial allocation for setting up 94 polyclincs has come as well. 

 The polyclinics would be built at a cost of Rs 170 crore. These are part of the AAP government’s health model to act as the lifeline for patients. 
 
 The bed addition is also seen as a way to bolster services. Hospitals located in different parts of west and northwest Delhi would benefit. For instance, 376 beds are being added to   in Moti Nagar. Another 270 are being added to   in Jafrabad. The other hospitals are located in Ashok Vihar, Pitampura, Mangolpuri, Rohini and Raghubir Nagar. “The addition of new beds will help reduce waiting time. We are also taking steps like hiring managers for administrative work and expediting the process of hiring of paramedical workforce,” said a senior official of the state health department.
 
 Health has been a focus area of the AAP government and it has started schemes such as free MRI and CT scan facilities for all patients. The Delhi government runs nearly 40 hospitals across Delhi. However, the patient load is high because many people from other states come for treatment. 
 
 With the Delhi government also preparing to present the Budget 2018-19 in March, focus on health and transport are going to be key focus areas. The EFC approvals are seen as an attempt to expedite projects that are already approved.
 
 Work on five new bus depots would begin at Bawana, East Vinod Nagar, Mundela Kalan and Ghummanhera. All along, the government’s concern over bringing new buses buses to the city revolved around lack of parking space. 
 
 EFC also cleared the remodelling of Najafgarh drain by construction of an RCC retaining wall. The project comes under the department of irrigation and flood control and might cost Rs 17 crore.
