MUMBAI: Faultlines within the Congress were exposed at a meeting of senior leaders in Vile Parle on Sunday during the Konkan Nivasi Melava, with Mumbai unit chief   facing criticism for “leaking the party manifesto“ to the media. Nirupam denied any such leak.

 Apart from Nirupam, those present were  , Nitesh Rane,  , Krishna Hegde, Varsha Gaikwad, Bhai Jagtap, Kalidas Kolambkar and Baba Siddiqui. Hegde said, “Kamat asked how the manifesto could be leaked when we have yet to see it. Everybody else agreed. I said all leaders must be taken into confidence. Are we fighting to win polls or as a formality?“ “Everyone including Narayan Rane, Veluswamy Naidu and   felt it must not be a one-man show.Certain aspirants have also been assured of a party ticket,“ one source said. “When we demanded transparency Nirupam said he would as sign a ticket to even an enemy if he felt the candidate could win. Does he consider his own party men enemies?“ Kamat said, “I just ven tilated the expectations of the loyal party worker.“ Nirupam told TOI he had “given the party vision, not manifesto, to the press.“ He said, “How else will people know what Congress brings to the table? The manifesto is still being drafted. And disputes must be addressed at party fora rather than going public.“
