 Rati Pal, who plays   in the serial  , is having a gala time with her co-actor   Mitra. The two actresses bond big time both on and off the sets. “Both Rhimjhim and me essay the roles of boro bou and choto bou of a zamindar house. While Rhimjhim’s character is extremely nice, where she adjusts with everyone, my character is a bit snooty,” said Priyanka. She added, “But we are best of friends now. We party together and now we are planning to watch a film together,” said Priyanka with a smile.
