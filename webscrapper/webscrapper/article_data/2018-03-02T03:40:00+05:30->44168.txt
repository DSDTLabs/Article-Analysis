Nagpur: Gitanjali Group chief Mehul Choksi’s chain of real estates have been found in Vidarbha as well. As a part of its ongoing action, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached a 17-acre land parcel at Parseoni taluka, some 40km from Nagpur. This is part of the 231 acre land bank attached by ED throughout the state on Thursday.  The purchase value of the land at Kondhasavali village of Parseoni had been declared at Rs44 lakh. ED has pegged its current market value at Rs8.62 crore. The land has been held in the name of Vidarbha Multiproduct SEZ Ltd.  The company has three directors — Milind Limaye, Aniyak Nair and Kaushik Naik. The three are directors in a number of other companies under Gitanjali Group. Sources said investigations to trace more assets were still under way. Vidarbha Multiproduct was established on January 29, 2015, soon after which the land was purchased. Apart form this, Gitanjali also had a plan to set up an SEZ at Butibori near Nagpur under the name Nagpur SEZ Limited. It was given an in-principle approval in 2008 but the company sought multiple extensions till 2012. The plans did not take off.  Choksi was quoted in TOI’s report dated July 2, 2012, that the company wanted government to change its policy and allow SEZs on a non-contiguous area. It had sought another extension hoping the policy may be changed as it could not acquire a contiguous patch for Butibori SEZ. Apart from the land parcel, the ED has also seized jewellery belonging to Gitanjali Group lying with 5-6 jewellers’ establishments in the region. Sources said the stock was consigned to jewellers for further sale without charging any price. Sources in the business said the stock was estimated to be valued over Rs3 crore. Since no money was exchanged for the jewellery sent to local jewellers by Gitanjali Group, it is being considered as Choksi’s assets. A similar action was taken last week in Raipur as well.
