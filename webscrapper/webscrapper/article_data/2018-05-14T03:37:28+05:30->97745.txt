MUMBAI: After seeing a fall for the first time in a decade in 2016-17,   figures rose again by 5% in the city in 2017-18. 

 Health experts called it a positive sign indicative of the fact that more women are accessing safe abortions at legal centres. 
 
 In 2017-18, 35,358 women had   (MTP) at the city’s 680 registered centres and hospitals, of which 96% were done in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. That only 4% in their secondtrimester availed of the services, however, surprised experts. Statistics say that about15% women seek an abortion in the second trimester due to late discovery of pregnancy, decision making, healthcare access and financial issues. 
 
 “Either the women are not getting these services at the private sector or they are altogether denied by doc
 tors fearing legal hassles often from officers overzealously implementing the MTP Act,” said a senior gynaecologist from a civic hospital. 
 
 There is also a dip in abortions among teens. In 2017-18, only one case was registered in the ‘below 15’ group from 271 in 201516. It had dipped to eight in 2016 17. Women aged 20-29 accounted for over 50% of abortions done. Of those who availed of services were also 1,453 unmarried women, which experts said is a sign that there is enabling environment for married and single women to seek the service. 
 
 “It is encouraging to note that abortion services are available to girls and women of all age groups,” said Vinoj Manning, executive director, Ipas Development Foundation that works for reproductive rights. 
 
 As per data, the pill-induced method was used for abortion in nearly 13,000 cases while manual aspiration was used in 6,000 cases. Data shows 33% abortions were done using “other methods”. “Conscious efforts need to be made to ensure only vacuum aspiration or medical methods using a combination of drugs are used to provide safe abortions,” he added. 
 
 BMC, in data given to   activist  , said around 19 women died days after pregnancy termination, but none of the deaths was directly related to abortion. 
 
 BMC’s deputy executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said, “Medical abortion is one of the safest procedures entailing low-risk of complications if performed by a qualified professional.”
