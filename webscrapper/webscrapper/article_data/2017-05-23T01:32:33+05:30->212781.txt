Mumbai: The state government has stayed the recently hiked   (RR) rates for land in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region for a month. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday announced in the assembly that the government has put a stay from May 19 for a month to avoid a cascading effect of RR on affordable housing as all civic charges are linked to these rates.

 Fadnavis in the legislative assembly said that the government has put a stay only for land RR rates and not for properties. “If the land RR is increased, the cascading effect on properties will be up to 90%. Hence, the stay has been imposed for a month,” said Fadnavis.
 
 RR rates are considered as market values of a property and are determined by the government for payment of stamp duty as well as municipal charges like fungible floor space index or development charges linked to local bodies.The stay will be applicable on nine corporations including Mumbai, Thane, Vasai-Virar and Kalyan-Dombivli. “Last year’s RR rates will be in force in MMR till new rates are announced,” said an official at the inspector general of registration and stamp duty’s office.
