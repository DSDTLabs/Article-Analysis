NEW DELHI: Taking note of complaints from Delhiites that   were not being provided at some  , chief minister   has issued directions to health minister   and chief secretary MM Kutty seeking immediate resolution of the problem as there is no  .

 Kejriwal has also made it clear that even after this direction if the problem remains unresolved then it will be construed as a ‘deliberate attempt’ to prevent the distribution of medicines. The CM added stern action will be taken against those found obstructing the release of free medicines to patients.
 
 Kejriwal’s order came after some people complained during CM’s ‘Janta Darbar’ that free medicines were not being provided to patients in some of the government hospitals. At all government hospitals, medicines are provided free of cost to patients and diagnostic tests are also done for free.
 
 Last year, in the run up to first anniversary of the election of Aam Admi Party-led government in Delhi, Kejriwal had announced that availability of free medicines will be ensured at all costs from February 1.
