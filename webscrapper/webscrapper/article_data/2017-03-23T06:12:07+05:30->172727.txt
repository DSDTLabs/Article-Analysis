CHANDIGARH: Haryana government has suspended an assistant district attorney and a sub-inspector (SI) in Bhiwani and transferred a staff nurse in Fatehabad for being lax in different cases pertaining to the Pre-Conception and   (PCPNDT) Act, 1994, with immediate effect. An anganwadi supervisor was also suspended for dereliction of duty in a separate case in Hisar district.

 The additional principal secretary to chief minister  , who was presiding over a division-level meeting to review the implementation of various schemes in Fatehabad on Wednesday, ordered the suspension and transfer of officials on the directions of the chief ministerâ€™s office.
 
 Gupta said Bhiwani ADA H H Malik had been suspended as he had failed to properly plead case related to the PCPNDT Act in the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Tosham on March 3, 2016, as a result of which the accused had managed to go scot-free.
 
 He said such verdicts not only led to wastage of time and effort, but also discouraged the officers and other employees concerned. Gupta said SI Ram Niwas had also been suspended for conducting bare minimum investigation in a case related to a diagnostic centre in Bhiwani, besides producing challan in court contrary to the procedure, which also resulted in the accused going scot-free.
 
 He said supervisor Omwati, who was deputed in Kohli circle of Adampur block in Hisar to monitor the functioning of anganwadi centres, was suspended for failing to carry out her duties properly.
 
 He said on the basis of complaints and departmental information, in another case pertaining to the PCPNDT Act, nurse at Jakhal community health centre   was transferred to Mandikhera civil hospital in Nuh district for her involvement in sex detection cases. Gupta also warned that officers and officials who fail to properly implement the schemes of the state government would invite stern action against themselves.
