KOCHI: The district collector Mohammed Y Safirulla has ordered for revoking exorbitant rates charged by   distribution agencies as  . A meeting to discuss these problems convened by the district collector on Tuesday also decided that the booking would be cancelled only if the customer couldn't accept the deliver three consecutive times. 

 If a consumer is not able to accept the delivery, the cylinder will only be available the next week. If the consumer fails to accept the delivery in the second chance also, the cylinder should be delivered the next week. It was based on a complaint by the members of a residents association that the workers who delivered the cylinders demanded high rates as delivery charges. The distribution agency should deliver LPG cylinders free of cost up to 5 km. According to the 2014 meeting regulations, delivery up to 5-10 km can be charged Rs 20 while it is Rs 25 for 10-15 km. The delivery charge for beyond 15 km should be Rs 30. The delivery charges also should be recorded on the bill. 
 
 An electronic weighing machine is also to be kept in the vehicle to measure the weight of the cylinder. To avoid the rubber washer of the cylinder from getting torn due to the dust, consumers have to compulsorily replace the cap before returning the empty cylinders. Customers can exchange damaged cylinders or cylinders weighing less, on request. The collector also made mandatory the requirement of maintaining the queue system while booking and also the rates to be displayed in a legible manner.
 
 Issues like delay in LPG supply in   were also discussed at the meeting. The district supply officer, representative from the gas agency and the taluk supply officers were also present.
