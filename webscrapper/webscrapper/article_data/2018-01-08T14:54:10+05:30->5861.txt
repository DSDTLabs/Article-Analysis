 Lana Del Rey has been sued by rock band   for reportedly ripping off  .

  
  
 Reportedly, rumours began circulating on January 7 that Radiohead was considering suing Lana for copyright infringement over her song  , which they claimed is similar to the band's 1992 hit 'Creep'.
 
 A source said that both Radiohead and Rey "are trying to thrash it out behind the scenes to prevent it from going to court." 
 
 The source added that Radiohead's team hoped that the English rock band would either "receive compensation or be credited on the list of songwriters to receive royalties." 
 
 While Radiohead has yet to comment on the rumours, Rey took to   on the same day to confirm that the rumours were true. She claimed that the band was in the process of suing her and that the lawsuit would likely end up in court. 
 
 "It's true about the lawsuit," she wrote. 
 
 She added: "Although I know my song wasn't inspired by 'Creep', Radiohead feel it was and want 100 percent of the publishing - I offered up to 40 over the last few months but they will only accept 100. Their lawyers have been relentless, so we deal with it in court." 
 
  
  
 This wasn't the first time Radiohead going through some legal issues with 'Creep'. Following the release of the song in September 1992, the band was sued over the single's similarities to the Hollies'   which was released back in 1974.
