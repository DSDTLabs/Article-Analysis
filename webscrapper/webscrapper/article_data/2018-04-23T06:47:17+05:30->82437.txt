LUCKNOW: A widowed doctor and her son were beaten up by their neighbours in   over a dispute on Sunday noon.

 Residents of sector C in Mahanagar, the families had been embroiled in a dispute for a long time. Along with violence, the neighbours—an advocate and his son-—have also been booked for sexual harassment as the doctor alleged that they misbehaved with her.
 
 
 The woman, a gynaecologist, stays with her two sons. Her husband had passed away several years ago.
 
 On Sunday morning, she heard her son quarrelling with her neighbour   Agarwal’s son on the street outside. Soon, Punit also joined the argument in favour of his son. The father-son duo then bashed up the boy and also broke his spectacles. When the woman tried to pacify the group, Punit and his son also bashed her up. They also tried to undress her, she alleged.
 
 The woman then called the police control room in Mahangar. However, before police reached, Punit and his son had fled.
 
 Station house officer   said the two sides had been at loggerheads for the past few days. Some neighbours also told police that Punit’s dog often urinates in the open and the nuisance had left a lot of people agitated with him.
 
 An FIR against Punit and his son had been registered under IPC sections 323, 354, 504, 506 and 427, amounting to violence, sexual harassment, criminal intimidation and causing damage.
 
 “Punit has not had any cases against him until now. We are looking for the fatherson duo,” said Pandey. The woman and her son were sent for medical examination, where several contusions on their bodies were found.
