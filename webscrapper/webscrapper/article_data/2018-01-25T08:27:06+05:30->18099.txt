CHENNAI: Overflowing   on a stretch of General Patters Road is causing inconvenience to pedestrians, commuters and tourists visiting   mall at  . 

 Traders and people say this overflow, which has been there for more than two years, is affecting the image of the city as a large number of people, including tourists, visiting the mall have to wade through it.
 
 The sewage flows, like a channel, from near a restaurant opposite the mall and spreads till a bus stop at the General Patters Road-Woods Road intersection. The constant flow of water has damaged a portion of the road. Traffic also slows down as vehicles try to avoid the sewage. 
 
 A retired tourism department official, N Ravi, says that it’s important to keep roads well-laid, clean and without sewage or waterlogging near malls and other popular spots frequented by tourists. 
 
 “Authorities should have the awareness that broken pavements, roads filled with potholes and flooded with sewage give a bad impression about the city,” he adds.
 
 A   official says that a manhole opposite the mall has been overflowing as the sewer line is incapable of handling the sewage load generated by commercial establishments. Metrowater has drawn up a proposal to enlarge the pipeline. An official said, “We are awaiting clearance from Chennai corporation for roadcut.”
 
 The sewer line on  , which is more than 50 years old, is now connected to a sewage pumping station in the nearby Border Thottam. “The old pipeline is 150-250mm in diameter. We will replace it with 250m pipeline all along the stretch. The sewer line will then be rerouted to the   pumping station through Whites Road.” The enlargement of the pipeline will also address the overflow of sewage from a manhole on Whites Road, the official added.
