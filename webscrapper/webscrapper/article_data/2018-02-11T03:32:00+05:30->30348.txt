Guntur: No hotelier had dared to put a grill outside the restaurant and exhibit the doner Kebab (chicken/lamb meat) being roasted to attract customers in Vijayawada. Selling   was not considered a good business proportion till 2-3 years ago. 

 However, the winds of change have started sweeping across the region after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. People from other parts, particularly from metros including Hyderabad, started flocking to the new capital city region of AP, Amaravati. This has brought a change in the food culture here as well. Changing food habits, and a touch of urban weather, encouraged a few entrepreneurs to launch the trendy food businesses.
 
 Shawarma, an east Mediterranean meat preparation, has tickled the taste buds of people, especially the youth, in Guntur and Vijayawada. Stalls offering this Arabic food are flocked by customers. 
 
 Shawarma is like a non-vegetarian sandwich. A huge block of lamb, or chicken, or mixed meat is placed on a vertical heating rod and continuously grilled. Portions of meat are shaved off from the block and served. Chefs chop off the block of meat and mix chips with some vegetables before rolling it out in a roti. “It is not only tasty but offers solid food,” said K Praveen, an engineering student. 
 
 The cheaply available food is a reason youth are relishing it. One roll of Shawarma is priced at just Rs 60. Grilling a vertical spit of stacked meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks, is believed to have developed in  . There are at least half-a-dozen shawarma stalls in Vijayawada and Guntur, more keep adding each passing month.
