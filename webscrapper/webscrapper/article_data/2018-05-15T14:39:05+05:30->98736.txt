CHANDIGARH: The   administration and municipal corporation are removing dead and dry trees from various locations of the city.   are being removed following   and   high court’s directions.

 As per official data, there are a total of 615 trees, which are either dead or pose a threat to life. There is a total of 1,65,597 trees in the city. The administration has assured the court that they would take necessary steps and ensure there is no delay in   of the dead trees. On the direction of the high court, the administration recently framed a policy for removal of trees posing a threat to life and property. The court had issued directions to the administration to frame a policy while hearing a case dated back to September 15, 2013, in which a 20-year-old girl suffered 75% disability after a dead tree fell on her.
 
 To reduce the time taken in the removal of dead trees, the administration has delegated the power to give approval to chief engineer of UT administration, municipal commissioner and chief conservator of forests, which earlier was with the UT adviser. 
 
 According to the policy framed by the department of forest and wildlife, for the removal of dead and dry trees, two officers — SDO, UT administration and MC, and forest range officer — will have to certify the trees in question pose a threat to life and property and needs to be removed immediately.
