MEERUT: Dalit leader   on Monday said that the RSS and the   were responsible for the acts of violence against Dalits as no preventive measures were taken. 

 "When the procession was being taken out, preventive measures should have been taken by the police and the administration. But nothing of the sort was done. And now Dalits are being targeted and are being hunted down. It is evident that CM Yogi and PM Modi want to replace the Constitution with Manusmriti," Mewani said, addressing a press conference. A team of Dalit leaders from nine states is in Saharanpur on a fact-finding mission on the incidents of violence that have occurred in the region over the last month, including the clash between Dalits and Thakurs over a   procession. 
 
 "If those responsible for the earlier clash on April 20 had been punished, the second incident would not have happened. Even for the procession of Maharana Pratap, adequate security should have been provided. We demand a judicial probe or an SIT probe into the matter," said Mewani.
 
 Ashok Bharti of the National Confederation of Dalit and Adivasi Organisations, who is part of the fact-finding team, said, "Action should have been taken against the perpetrators in the April 20 incident. Instead, the   who registered an FIR against the BJP MP was transferred. That sent out a message of impunity and that is why the incident of May 5 happened."
