Honey Bee 2’s first half is filled with humour, and gives full justice to it’s prequel. While most of the cast are seen reprising their roles from Honey Bee, there are some interesting add-ons in casting, such as the roles played by Lena and Sreenivasan, and their addition is like a breath of fresh air. 

 The film is around 2 hours 18 minute-long film, and as the movie is on the verge of an interval, the scene arouses a lot of curiosity among the audience, keeping them engaged and ensuring that they are glued to the seats till the very end. 
 
 The entire plot dwells on an impending wedding, and actors Asif Ali, Bhavana, Lal and Suresh Krishna shine throughout the first half.
