BHOPAL: The ‘smart road’ project will be completed at the earliest, assured   ( ) mayor Alok Sharma on Monday. The smart city road project, estimated to cost about Rs 27 crore, has faced turbulence right from the get-go. 

 Making the civic body’s intent and priority clear, the mayor termed opposition’s stand over road as anti-development. “Smart City road is gathering pace and soon all hindrances would be overcome.” Around 35% of the road development in non-populated area is expected to be completed this month.
 
 Announcment about the four lane, 30-metre wide road stretching over 2 km, came in December last year. Three months later, the civic body issued eviction notices to residents of Ahata Rustam Khan, a private colony that stretches along Banganga. Around 500 families face eviction.
 
  BMC move was challenged in a court by few individuals, whose property was demolished. BMC claims the area to be government land. Local corporator Sabista Zaki and her supporters approached   (MPHC) on the issue. 
 
 Over 100 commercial structures near Polytechnic Square were demolished. Providing relief to affected, the BMC announced development of a market complex where the affected would be given alternative commercial space. 
 
 On Monday, Sharma laid the foundation stone for ‘smart street’ in MP Nagar. The smart city project is part of pan-city development. 
 
 “The project aims at rethinking urbanisation. It is a solution to reimagine development using existing space and improve liveability in Bhopal,” said BMC additional commissioner and   (BSCDCL) CEO Chandramauli Shukla.
