Actor   said blockbuster superhero film   was the first action ever that film she enjoyed watching. The 47-year-old actor said the Patty Jenkins-directed film was her favourite movie of 2017 and she now understands men's fixation with superheroes. 

  
  
 "'Wonder Woman' was my favourite film of the year. I thought that was completely magnificent. It's the first time I've really enjoyed an action film because I could identify with the character."
 
 "She was a little brunette tomboy and then she became a superhero and I was like, 'Yeah'. I realised that's why men like action movies. They think it's them," Weisz told. The   actor said if an opportunity comes her way she would love to feature in a movie like 'Wonder Woman'. 
 
 Weisz said, "Yeah, definitely. It was good to see that a movie with a female character at the centre can make tons of money. We're not some weird outlier group. We're half the planet!"
