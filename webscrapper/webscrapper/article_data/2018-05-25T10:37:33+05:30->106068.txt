LUCKNOW: SP patriarch   and ailing   veteran   have also sought more time from the UP government to vacate their bungalow as per the Supreme Court order. 

 While the family of Tewari, a former CM of both UP and Uttarakhand, on Thursday sought one year's time, Mulayam has requested for a two-year extension considering his Z-plus security. His son and former UP CM   has already sought two years' time.
 
 In a letter sent to UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Tewari's wife Ujjawala has said that she was not in a position to come to Lucknow because of the frail health of her husband. "Yah nahi kaha ja sakta ki kab kya ho jaye...," she said, briefly describing the condition of Tewari who is undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital. Tewari was hospitalized in September last year after he suffered a brain stroke.
 
 Ujjawala said that she was also under depression and was undergoing treatment. She said that her son Rohit Shekhar, too, was not in a position to leave Delhi since he had to take care of her ailing parents. Ujjawala said that her husband gave selfless service to the country as a freedom fighter. "That is why Tewari ji does not have a house of his own," she said, maintaining that the family respected the orders of the Supreme Court. The Tewaris also run a foundation-Pandit Narayan Dutt Tewari Sarvajan Vikas Foundation-from their 1-A Mall Avenue bungalow in Lucknow. 
 
 Estate department officials said that they were bound by the SC order and would act accordingly. A senior official in the department, meanwhile, said that the state government would be taking a legal opinion on the application filed by Tewari, like in case of   and Mulayam. 
 
 As many as six UP CMs were served eviction notice by the state government on May 18 after the apex court annulled a state law that allowed former UP CMs to occupy government accommodations.
