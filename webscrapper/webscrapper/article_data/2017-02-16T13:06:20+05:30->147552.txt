BHOPAL: South  , Surat lifted the   trophy after registering a three-wicket win over Delhi University in the final, played at   (BU) on Wednesday.

 Batting first, Delhi batsmen had a tough time negotiating the Surat pace battery. Besides, the fielders supported the bowlers. This was proved to the hilt when Delhiâ€™s Rahul Khatri who was looking in good touch was run out when his individual score was 46. 
 
 Rahul had tried to make the team score a competitive one but he was not allowed to flourish in the middle after scoring 40 runs. Other batsmen also failed to come up with noteworthy contributions for the team. In the end, Delhi could just manage to register 171 runs for the loss of nine wickets. 
 
 Chasing the target, complacency by Surat batsmen landed the team in trouble during the middle overs. However, the small target was not much of a headache as they overtook it in the 43rd over. For Surat, Syed was the highest scorer with 57 runs while Kayur had 46 runs against his name.
 
 In the match to decide third place,   scripted a facile seven-wicket victory over Meerut University. Chasing a paltry target of 84 runs, Meerut completed the formalities in just 13.3 overs for the loss of three wickets.
 
 MLA (Bhopal Central)   was the chief guest at the prize distribution ceremony. BU registrar UN Shukla, Prof MK Shrivastava and director sports (BU) Akhilesh Sharma were present.
