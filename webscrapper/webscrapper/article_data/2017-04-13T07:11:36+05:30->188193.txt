 Amnesty International India executive director Aakar Patel said, “The   in its 2016 judgment had made it clear that there should be no immunity for human rights violations by members of the armed forces. “It is disturbing that the central government appears to believe that respecting fundamental rights will hamper the Army’s ability to conduct operations. Does the government support blanket immunity for human rights violations? Are they against independent and impartial investigations?”
 
 Lawyer and human rights activist Vrinda Grover said, “It is extremely unfortunate and alarming to see that the government, which has the responsibility under the Constitution to protect the right to life of people, is seeking review of the SC order.” 
 
 Sanjoy Hazarika, director, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), said, “Immunity for human rights violations only increases public anger and alienation. It is in the government’s own interest to deliver justice for these violations, regardless of who the perpetrator is.”
