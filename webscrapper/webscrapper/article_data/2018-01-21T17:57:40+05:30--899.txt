In 2017, Bollywood presented us with films that boasted of the traditional filmy masala but films that also moved away from the typical content. 

 
 
  The films nominated in the Best Film category were Varun Dhawan-Alia Bhatt starrer ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’, Akshay Kumar and Bhumi Pednekar’s blockbuster ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’, Irrfan Khan-Saba Qamar starrer ‘Hindi Medium’, Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s sleeper hit ‘Bareilly Ki Barfi’, and Zaira Wasim and Aamir Khan’s ‘Secret Superstar’.
 
  The 63
  Jio   2018 Best Film award was presented to ‘Hindi Medium’.
