Vijayawada: A 45-year-old man allegedly killed his wife with an iron rod on Wednesday night at   village of Krutivennu mandal in Krishna district. Police are on hunt for the accused who is at large after the crime.

 Krutivennu SI Siva said that Mary used to toil hard for money and hand over her earnings to the husband. 
 
 According to the police, Yesu’s unemployment led to a family dispute. Last time when the woman returned from Kuwait, she had given money to her brother T Ramesh, who was unwell, instead of her husband. This might have prompted the angry Yesu to plot the   of his wife whom he had taken to Orlagondi on the pretext of taking her to a marriage ceremony. He hit his wife with the iron rod on her skull, leaving her dead on the spot and absconded from the premises. 
 
 Locals saw the woman’s body and alerted Krutivennu police immediately. Following the complaint lodged by her brother T Ramesh, Bandar CI BB Ravi Kumar has started probing into the murder and cops are trying to trace the accused who is absconding.

However, Mary has been working for a company as a domestic maid in Kuwait and has made three visits in the past.
