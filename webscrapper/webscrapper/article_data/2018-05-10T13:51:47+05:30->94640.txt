COIMBATORE: Almost six months after a   verdict came in favour of the city corporation to establish a sewage treatment plant (STP) in the   region in the city, the civic body has sought final explanation from the contractor regarding the specific timeline to complete its construction.

 “We have given two week time to the contractor to specify the timeline in which the project could be completed,” a corporation official said, adding that they have been issuing notices one after the other to the contractor, but have not received any proper response.
 
 The civic body would carry forward the construction work with the same contractor only if the officials were convinced with the explanation, if not, a new tender would be floated, the official said.
 
 The construction work had not started even after the verdict came in favour due to the internal issues with the contractor. Citing that, the official said that they had paid about Rs 18 crore and about 60% of work is being completed. They have also assigned a third party to certify the percentage of work that has been completed. 
 
 The company has taken up the contract to construct the sewage treatment plant that would treat 45 million litres sewage daily, during 2008 at an estimated cost of Rs 45 crore. Following the protests from the residents of the region, the project was struck and a petition was filed at the court seeking a stay. The civic body filed an appeal and received the verdict in its favour.
 
 This is one of the important projects for the civic body as it would help the residents of over 20 wards to connect their sewage outlets with the underground drainage.
