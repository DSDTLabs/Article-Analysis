Chennai:   may have gone down to   in the 12th round of the ongoing   in Berlin, but he scripted a stunning turnaround in his 13th outing in the competition on Monday evening. Caruana defeated   to grab back the calling shots in the event. The win on Monday gives Caruana the bragging rights as the 8-player tourney heads to its final round on Tuesday. Caruana, who scripted a 39-move victory with the white against Aronian, has 8 points in his kitty.

 
 
 Caruana may have had an off day in the previous round where he lost to Karjakin, but the US GM pulled his socks up and stepped up the game when it needed the most. More importantly, it will give him the much needed self-belief as he heads to the business end of the event.
 
 
 Closely following Caruana is Azerbaijan Grandmaster Mamedyarov Shakhriyar who got the better of Alexander Grischuk to be in the second place with 7.5 points from 13 rounds. Tied with Mamedyarov in the second place is Sergey Karjakin who drew his encounter against Wesley So. Former World champion Vladimir Kramnik too split points against Liren Ding. The draw meant Ding was in the third position with 7 points. 
 
 
 As the event heads to the final round, those who stay in the hunt for the big prize include Caruana, Mamedyarov, Karjakin and Ding. The rest of the field are out of contention.
 
 
 On Tuesday, the final round will see Caruana facing Grischuk while Mamedyarov and Karjakin lock horns with Kramnik and Ding respectively.
