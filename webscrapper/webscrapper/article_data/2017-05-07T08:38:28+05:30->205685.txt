LUCKNOW: Authorities on Saturday inspected two   in the city but the exercise was a mere formality as the   were not accompanied by the   staff to examine if the dispensing units had chips installed in them. As expected, no anomalies were detected at the two petrol pumps which were thereafter given a clean chit by the authorities. According to ADM civil supply Alka Verma, teams inspected two petrol pumps but due to shortage of technical staff they conducted only physical check.

 Following crackdown on petrol pumps, around 20 have been sealed by district administration and STF so far in coordination with weight and measures department. As per district administration officials, there is always a team of technical experts accompanying to figure the exact problem in the machine. The teams raiding petrol pumps go always with their department members and coordinate with other relevant wings of district administration and district essential commodities supply department.
 
 According to weights and measure department officials, they have no technical expertise but their inspectors work in the field with the help of technical training given to them to check that measurement petrol and diesel dispensed is correct.
