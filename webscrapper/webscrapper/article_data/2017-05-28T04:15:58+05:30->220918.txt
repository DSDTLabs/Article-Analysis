GURUGRAM: Taking note of the multiple instances of concrete and glass panes falling off the building façade of   Arch, a residential project in Sector 58 on  , the department of town and country planning ( ) has directed the developer to submit a structural audit report of the building in a week’s time. 

 The developer was also directed to prepare a plan with a timeline to fix the structural deficiencies of the building. 
 
 A team of officials from DTCP on Wednesday inspected the township, after a report was published in TOI on May 24, highlighting the concerns of residents. “Directions have been issued to the developer to conduct structural audit of the building,” said assistant town planner (ATP) RS Batth.
 
 Batth said during the inspection residents had highlighted the incidents of past weeks. “The developer will have to complete the work within a stipulated time to avoid such incidents in future,” said Batth.
 
 Planning officer Jaibir Sharma said the project has 10 towers. Residents said a piece of concrete fell off from the balcony of a 10th floor flat in F tower and landed on the 3rd floor balcony on May 14, damaging it. “The residents spotted the debris next morning,” Sharma said. Again on May 19, a glass pane fell off from the club house wall.
 
 “The quality of construction is so bad that it has put our life at risk,” said a resident, who works with a private bank.
 
 The builder began handing over possession of the towers in 2016. As the construction process isn’t complete, the society has only received a conditional occupation certificate. A representative of the developer said they will submit the report as directed by the DTCP. “We have started the repair work to fix the problem,” he said.
