VADODARA: Communally sensitive areas of   and   were on the boil on Sunday evening after rioting broke out during the annual Ram Navmi procession organized by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.

 Heavy stone pelting was witnessed between mobs of two communities in the area, forcing police to lob nearly 30 tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. One person was injured and several vehicles were damaged as the mobs went on a rampage near Fatehpura crossroads in the Old City.
 
 According to the police, the trouble was sparked off after a stone was hurled when the procession was passing from Hathikhana crossroads. The stone hit one person in in the head. Soon, panic spread in the area but procession headed towards Fatehpura where the violence broke out.
 
 Mobs from both sides began pelting stones at each other. Some roadside carts and autos were damaged in the melee even as shopkeepers downed the shutters and fled from the spot. When the same procession was passing from Padmavati Shopping complex, again a minor incident of stone pelting was reported. 
 
 “Police reached the spot immediately and took control of the situation. We have increased the patrolling in the old city areas but situation is normal now,” said Manoj Sashidhar, city police commissioner. 
 
 The cops are trying to identify the miscreants who sparked the trouble. 
 
 “We will be filing police complaint and identity the rioters through CCTV footages. No one has been arrested yet,” said Sashidhar.
 
 The police commissioner also took rounds of the areas where stone pelting occurred. Traffic on the old city roads was disrupted for sometime but soon normalcy was restored. The police had a tough time controlling the mobs from both sides.
