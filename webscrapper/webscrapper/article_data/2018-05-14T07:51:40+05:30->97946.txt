HYDERABAD: With decibel levels in the city increasing rapidly, sensitive zones are falling prey to noise pollution. Statistics with   show that sound produced in some commercial and sensitive zones are higher than permissible levels.

 Noise monitoring systems in Hyderabad are located at commercial zones of Abids and Punjagutta, Jeedimetla industrial zone, the silence zone at Zoo Park, Gachibowli and Jubilee Hills’ residential zone.
 
 
  
 
 
 According to   (CPCB), the biggest contributors to ambient noise pollution in major cities across India, including Hyderabad, are industries, transport vehicles, construction activities, generator sets and firecrackers.
 
 Residents in some areas also complain against bus and other heavy vehicle drivers who honk continuously early in the mornings and late at nights. “These bus drivers do it on purpose. I can’t sleep after 4am on some days. There’s no reason for them to honk at that time of the day, since there’s hardly any traffic in the area,” said  , a resident of SR Nagar. Apart from that, loudspeakers at street corners often produce high decibel sounds, he added.
 
 Experts say one of the reasons for the problem increasing is a delay in zoning. WG  , a senior environmentalist, says, “The problem is that, as a society, we are not against noise, we are ok with noise. We think that making noise is festival. Only if we define it as noise and consider it as a problem then it becomes a problem. We can enforce silent zone restrictions in an area only if the area is zoned in the first place.”
 
 Due to narrow roads and high vehicle density, sensitive zones such as schools and hospitals see high noise pollution.
