 actress   is all excited about her maiden Malayalam movie and says it is the most technically superior movie she has ever worked on.

 When she was recently in Kerala, a visibly moved Priya said, “I think it is the most ever technically superior film that I have worked on. I thank director   for making me part of it. Also it was great working with him who is a self-assured director, and who is open to suggestions. With actor   on board, who is also a writer and producer and one who brings out his experiences into shooting, it was all cherishing experience.”
 
 The actress, who has worked in numerous industries, appreciated Malayalam for the kind of films it does.. “When working in the Malayalam industry, everyone from the artistes who play the small characters to the main lead approaches their craft in a different way and it gives me a new experience to work on,” she adds.
