INDORE:Traffic chaos is very common at   and commuters. The square has become one of the most   in the city, but the officials concerned had turned a blind eye to the situation. Interestingly, a police station is also located just next to the square.

  The square leads towards Mhow Naka, Navlakha, Tower Square and DAVV. The road leading towards   from the square is one-way, but motorists, flouting the traffic rules use the road as two-way leading to heavy traffic jams and accidents. Both residents and traders are fed up with the problem.
 
 The residents have demanded an intersection on the Bus Route Transit System (BRTS) near the entrance of   road since motorists zoom into the path from any direction.
 
 Due to presence of educational institutes, hostels, university, and business outlets there is a heavy flow of traffic at the square. In absence of a crossing on the BRTS route near   area, commuters often drive on wrong direction posing a risk for others on AB Road.
 
 Local shop owners complained that motorists often ignore traffic rules at this square and traffic pressure is also high as it is a major thoroughfare for vehicles coming from both east and west parts of the city. Encroachment on the roads leading towards Khandwa road is another cause of accidents on the route.
