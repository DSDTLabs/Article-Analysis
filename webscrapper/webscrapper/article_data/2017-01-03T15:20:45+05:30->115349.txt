CHENNAI: Actor Karunas-led Mukkulathur Pulipadai, an   of the ruling   in  , on Tuesday threatened to conduct   during   if the Centre fails to facilitate the conduct of the popular bull taming sport by lifting the ban on it.

 Karunas said that his party and like-minded organisations would resort to such a move, as it was a “traditional event.”
 
 Accusing the Centre of being “unfair” to the state on various heads, the MLA recalled the Union government’s volte-face in setting up a Cauvery management board and a Cauvery water regulation committee as directed by the Supreme Court in line with the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal. “The Centre cannot play politics with Tamil Nadu anymore,” he told TOI.
 
 Karunas lambasted the DMK’s agitation demanding jallikattu, as it was during the previous Congress-led UPA regime, in which DMK was ally, that the ban was enforced on the sport through a notification.
 
 The BJP government issued an executive order in January last year, exempting jallikattu and bullock cart races from the 2011 notification prohibiting bulls from being used as performing animals. The Supreme Court dismissed the Tamil Nadu government’s petition in November to review its 2014 order banning jallikattu.
