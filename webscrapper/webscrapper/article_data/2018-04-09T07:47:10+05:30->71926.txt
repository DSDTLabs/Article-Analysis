SHIMLA: Lakshmi Stone Crusher owned by  , son of senior   leader  , who was health, revenue and law minister in the previous Congress regime, has been slapped with a fine of over Rs 2.90 crore after it was found that the crusher was not only functioning illegally but was also involved in illegal mining. The BJP government already had issued a notice, giving a last chance to the owner to deposit the fine or else face action as per revenue law.

 This crusher located just 1.5 km from Mandi was owned by  , mother of Kaul Singh, and after her death in 2011 Chandershekhar got the ownership as per her last wish. 
 
 Darang MLA of BJP, Jawahar Thakur, recently raised the issue in the state assembly. Claiming that the crusher was functioning illegally, Thakur had also claimed that waste material of crusher was also being dumped in the adjoining river. 
 
 He said that from 2012 to2017, sand and gravel was sold illegally by this crusher and mining official in 2014 had calculated the fine to be around Rs 2 crore but even after that mining continued. He said that mining had taken place in around 2 hectares due to which the road connecting the nearby village is under threat of caving in. 
 
 Industries minister Bikram Singh in his reply said that the crusher was functioning without permission and clearances for the last many years. He said that mining lease had lapsed in 2008 and Kagdul Thakur had applied for its renewal. He said that permission granted to the crusher lapsed in 2009 but even after that it kept on functioning illegally. He said that taking cognizance of this, the mining department had been challaning it from time to time. 
 
 Bikram said that on October 7, 2010, April 19, 2010, July 22, 2011, July 4, 2014, and July 19, 2017, challans were filed in the court in this regard. He said while disposing of the challans, the court had imposed a fine of Rs 4,000 on the crusher.
 
 The minister said that for illegal mining from 2009 to August 14, 2017, notice had been issued for recovery of Rs 2, 90,08,000 fine. He said that further process was on to make the recovery. 
 
 He said that the final notice had been issued, giving Chandershekhar 15 days time to deposit the fine.
