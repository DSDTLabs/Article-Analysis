With Namma   connecting the city, it has become the preferred mode of commuting for many Bengalureans. Most people spend anything between 15 and 40 minutes on average on the daily ride to and from work/school/college. While there are those who catch up on Zzzs or look over a fellow commuter’s shoulder, keeping their gaze fixed firmly on their phone screens, most people fall back on an activity that keeps them engaged on their Metro ride. Here are the favourites:

 
 
 Listening to music seems to be one of best ways to kill time on the Metro. Nearly all youngsters can be seen shaking their heads — and occasionally other parts of their bodies, if space permits, of course — to songs on their playlists. And there seems to be one-upmanship when it comes to ear/headphones — bada hai toh behtar hai, apparently.
 
 
 
 Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Twitter,   — one can always find solace on social media when bored. While   seems to be the preferred app to kill time on, younger folk will surprise you with their dexterity and speed at which they toggle between the aforementioned apps. 
 
 
 
 Games are a good distraction, and, somehow, crushing candies seems to pass the time quicker. Even those who don’t find a seat have mastered getting into the right position to balance holding their bag, the grab handle and their phone, swiping rigorously at their mobile screens till they reach their destination.
 
 
 
 Still watching soaps on TV? You’re so 2000 and late! City folk on the go are making the most of apps such as  ,  ,   Prime and   to catch up on soaps and reality TV on their phones between Metro stations.
 
 
 
 It’s heartening to know that the reading habit is not dead yet — something that we discovered on the Metro. Be it ebooks or traditional ones, there are a handful of people who prefer to invest time in a good read while on the move.
