AHMEDABAD: The state government has issued a notification making it clear that   cannot take fees that are higher than what had been charged in the 2016-17 academic year. The notification, issued on April 7, reiterates that schools can charge fees only for the first quarter. The government has also stressed that admission and other fees charged with the fees for first quarter will have to be refunded if the amount turns out to be higher than what the fee committee determines.

 Several schools have informed parents that they have not received any notification from the government. Parents are now ensuring that they send a copy of the notification to schools, and are also seeking an acknowledgement when the copy is received. A parent said that schools are forcing them to buy expensive books, shoes, and art kits. Some parents said schools have announced that they would increase transport costs to cope with the rise in fuel prices.
 
 A parent, Mubaraq Shaikh who is an assistant vice-president of a company, said: “Several parents were complaining that schools were refusing to adhere to the government notification. I have urged the education minister to ensure there is perfect communication with schools.” He said he has also requested that the fee cap law be strictly implemented to prevent schools from overcharging.
 
 “Things are getting dirtier as the education sector is attracting businesspeople who want start their ‘unit’ by becoming school trustees,” Shaikh said. “By collecting money from parents under various heads, these schools have made quality education a privilege only few can afford and thus are depriving many students of education — which is a fundamental right.”
