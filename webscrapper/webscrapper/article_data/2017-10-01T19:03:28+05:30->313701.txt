NAVI MUMBAI: Hundreds of live stingrays, prawns and other smaller fish species were washed ashore close to the   coast in   district in the past two days.

 Marine experts said that this phenomenon usually takes place towards the end of monsoon season when the oxygen levels in the sea drops, leading to disorientation among fishes, such as the stingrays.
 
 For the local fishermen at Sasavane, Navgaon and Awas coastal villages in Alibag taluka, its been a fish bonanza for the past two days as they have been literally picking up the stranded species and selling them in the local markets.
 
 "The bigger fishes such as the common stingrays, butterflyrays among others from this genus tend to hunt the smaller fish species near the coast. However, towards the end of monsoon season, the oxygen level in the sea drops and hence the fishes are washed ashore alive. This has been noticed at the coastal villages in Alibag taluka in the last two days," said marine conservationist, Pradip Patade.
 
 An official from the Alibag based fisheries department has also confirmed about these live strandings.
 
 "Around four years ago, a similar incident was observed at the   of Raigad district where several fishes like the stingrays and others were washed ashore. I feel that besides a seasonal change, water pollution and chemical refuse in our seas has also affected our marine biodiversity," said Mumbai based environmentalist D Stalin.
 
 He added that a systematic and proper study of the marine ecosystem around our coast needs to be done for the sake of conservation of fishes and also bigger mammals such as whales which have also been noticed in the blue waters next to Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and other Konkan regions.
