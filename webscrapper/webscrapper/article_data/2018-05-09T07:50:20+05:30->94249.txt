When the pictures uploaded from inside the jail went viral, the police and jail authorities conducted searches and seized four mobile phones, making it clear that gangsters were still using mobile phones in jails. A case was registered against seven inmates. Before that, gangster-turned Punjabi language activist  , alias Lakha Sidhana, had gone online from inside Faridkot jail in November 2017.

 Faridkot SSP   said, “A case under the Jail Manual Act has been registered while the police is thoroughly investigating the seizure of mobile phones from jail. The massive search was carried out on a tip-off.”
