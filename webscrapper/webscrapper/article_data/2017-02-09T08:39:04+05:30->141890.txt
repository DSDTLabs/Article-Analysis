 SSB sources said most of the victims were children and they were being trafficked to be used as child workers. 
 
 SSB IG Chanchal Shekhar said most of the children are taken to cities like Mumbai, Jaipur and Rajkot. He also said Nepal is in class-I category on the global index of cross-border human trafficking while India falls in class-III category. That means human trafficking from Nepal is among the highest in the world. He also said most of the rescued victims belonged to remote villages of East Champaran and Sitamarhi districts.
 
 “The influx of trafficked people from Nepal increased after the 2015 earthquake that caused heavy casualties and children were the worst sufferers,” Shekhar said, adding that SSB works with several non-government organizations (NGOs), including Nepalese NGO Maiti Nepal, to prevent child trafficking.
 
 Shekhar also said the SSB would be strengthened more to counter human trafficking and villagers would be trained under civic action plans in this regard.
