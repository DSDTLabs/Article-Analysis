HYDERABAD: Are you one of those still scratching their heads about terms like  , ethereum and various other kinds of cryptocurrencies? Worry not, you are not alone as even the man credited with having safeguarded the Indian economy during the 2008 global financial crisis, by taking effective measures much before the onset of the crisis, former RBI governor  , has said that he still does not understand Bitcoins. 

 "Frankly, I tried to learn about Bitcoins, I did not succeed. I asked one of my friend's sons to put it in writing and he gave it to me in a two-and-a-half page write-up, still I did not understand," Reddy said while delivering the keynote address at Artha, ISB's annual finance conclave, in Hyderabad on Saturday. He was also quick to add that Bitcoins may not be considered digital currency.
 
 In fact,   is mulling introducing a digital currency which would be linked to the value of the Pound Sterling. "As of now in the world, it is the fiat money (fiat currency is legal tender whose value is backed by the government) that is accepted," Reddy said.
 
 Even Union finance minister   had mentioned in the   that Bitcoin is not legal tender in India.
 
 On being asked about how the global financial sector has changed a decade after the financial crisis of 2007-08, Reddy said he is a bit confused about the recent trends in markets . 
 
 "When there is a disconnect between the financial world governed by the US and the real economy governed by China and the world political order is being challenged indirectly,...I think even finance is also bit uncertain," Reddy said.
 
 Even after the global financial crisis, Reddy said the fundamental problem has been that while all regulations are at the national level, finance continues to be global. He also added that there seems to be a disconnect as stock markets and financial markets have seen appreciable growth but recovery has not happened at the ground level.
