BENGALURU:   ( ) defended its decision to field Vaishnavi Jakka Reddy in the doubles at the BWF World Junior (U-19) Championships, to be held at Yogyakarta, Indonesia, next month.

 Vaishnavi, 15, who won the Belgian Junior meet last Sunday to rise to 10th in the world rankings, had pulled out of the squad for the Worlds alleging favouritism in selection and saying that she was not willing to play doubles in individual events as it was not her forte. BAI president   said Vaishnavi had not participated in any of the national ranking tournaments which the federation had listed in its selection criteria.
 
 “Vaishnavi stays abroad and plays in international tournaments. If she is accommodated in the squad at someone's expense, parents of other players will question us as to how can she be better than their children if she hasn't even played them. So we told Vaishnavi's father to allow the player to play in domestic circuit,” Sarma said.
 
 While BAI acknowledged that Vaishnavi is a good player, it also argued that age group players cannot be judged on international rankings alone. “Except the Asian and World meets, BAI and the government do not send teams for junior tournaments. It is entirely the parents' initiative.
 
 “If we recognise those rankings there will be deep frustration among many players here as they would also want to play in those tournaments to prove their mettle. So, we thought that national ranking tournaments would provide a level-playing field and made participation in them mandatory .
 
 “But considering Vaishnavi's talent and international ranking, we put her in doubles in the individual events and in singles in the team championships.”
