PUNE: The civic elections are over and the focus of senior officials of the Maharashtra Airport Development Company Ltd ( ) is back on the proposed   project.

 A senior official of the MADC said the project’s two important assignments — the finalization of a consultant for preparing the detailed project report (DPR) and the finalization of the   — would be completed by the weekend. The officials at the MADC, which fumbled over the dates earlier, stated a meeting would be convened in a day or two to finalize the things.
 
 “Things are moving on the new airport front again. A meeting has been scheduled this week. In all likelihood, the consultant for the DPR and the compensation package would be finalized in it. By the first half of next week, we will be in a position to say something concrete,” Vishwas Patil, the vice-chairman-cum-managing director of MADC told TOI.
 
 A week before the civic polls were announced, the MADC had said the announcement about the consultant would be done shortly. But it was put on hold dut to the model code of conduct.
 
 A source said the compensation package would include the land pooling scheme Andhra Pradesh had adopted while creating its new capital city at Amravati. The landowners would get a part of their land in developed form in addition to jobs in the project as well as compensation under the scheme.
 
 Earlier, guardian minister Girish Bapat had said the compensation package would be a combination of the best practices of land acquisition followed in states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. He had said the package would be very attractive prompting the landowners to approach the government to offer their plots for the project.
 
 Another MADC official said, “A global tender in connection with the appointment of a consultant had been floated last month. It got a decent response. The consultant will conduct site inspection and the whole project will be planned in a detailed way. We are hoping the process will be smooth.”
