NEW DELHI: A security guard posted with the office of a real estate company at   Road was found murdered in the guard room on Sunday. Police said that the killer had stabbed the guard with a sharp object and locked the room from inside. Prima facie it appears to be a case of enmity. Police have not ruled out the possibility of a failed burglary attempt.

 The incident was discovered on Sunday afternoon when another security guard posted with the office reached for his duty and discovered the door locked from inside. When he got no response, the guard broke open the door and found the victim Jitender Shukla (38) lying dead in a pool of blood. He had a deep cut on his throat.
 
 It appears that the killers had entered the ground floor office through a rear window. It is likely that they had planned the   and locked the door before escaping. The body was sent for an autopsy. Police said that no recording devices were found in the room.
