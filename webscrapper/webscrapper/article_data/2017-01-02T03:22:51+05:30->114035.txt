NAVI MUMBAI:   forest officials had a tough time rescuing two leopard cubs, which fell into wells while searching for food during the last fortnight. 

 Ratnagiri range forest officer B R   said it took them hardly 15 minutes to rescue the three and a half year cub which fell in well at   village,   taluka on Monday.
 
 But they had a tough time on December 16 rescuing a year and a half old cub from a well in   village, which was hiding in a small opening in the well. Left with no choice, the forest officials caught a dog and put it in a cage and lowered it in the well. The cub entered the cage after a long time but did not harm the dog. 
 
 The cubs and dog were released in their natural habitats.
