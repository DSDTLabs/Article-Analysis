lleana D’Cruz believes that her Baadshaho co-star   is a bigger prankster than her   co-actor  . The actress, currently shooting with Ajay, laughs and says, “He is a far bigger prankster than Akshay. He is unbelievable and puts in a lot of effort in order to execute a prank. But he does it only to maintain a light atmosphere on the sets.But when I was working with Akshay on Rustom, he sent a message to   from my phone. I was yet to start working with him at that point. I had to do some damage control and explain to Milan that it wasn’t me, but Akshay who sent the message. In Ajay’s case, you’re not even left with any room for damage control. So, you can imagine!”
