CHANDIGARH:   MLA from   and Indian Youth Congress (IYC) chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring has taken to social media to clarify that he has no grouse against the party leadership for not making him a minister in the Punjab government even during the recent the cabinet expansion. 

 Warring, who was being seen as a frontrunner for induction in the council of ministers, told TOI that he thought of posting the video to reach out to his supporters who had been trying to connect with him on social media. 
 
 "I have no hard feelings about the cabinet expansion even though it is natural for any politician to have aspirations," he added.
 
 The video posted on Warring's Facebook page has got over 18k views and has been shared 1,300 times. In 2012, Congress president  's protege, Warring ,was hailed as a giant killer for defeating his now party colleague Manpreet Singh Badal, who had contested as an Akali rebel back then. Warring managed to end 19-year-long hegemony of the ruling Badal family over this assembly constituency.
 
 "There is no annoyance with the party leadership at any level. I owe my political career to Congress president Rahul Gandhi and chief minister  . I myself went to congratulate the newly sworn in ministers on their first day in office on Tuesday," he said.
 
 The 20-minute video has an visibly emotional Warring talk about his humble beginnings and how he managed to win the 'tough' Giddarbaha seat, for the Congress.
