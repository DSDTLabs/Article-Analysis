 This can be called as the biggest examination scam of the world. Cancelling admissions of more than 600 MBBS students is not a small thing. However, this is just a small portion of it as there are many other non-deserving candidates who were selected through Vyapam for so many years. 
 
  
 
 
  Right now, only the medical aspirants have been punished but there are various other examinations where such scams are still going on. Parents and students still do not fear taking a shortcut. Paper leaks, impersonators, and are still on year after year not only in MP but other states as well. 
 
  
 
 
 We sought a CBI enquiry hoping for a fair investigation but unfortunately the main culprits are still not punished. Until the prime minster gives CBI a free hand I don't think CBI enquiry is of any use. 
 
  
 
 
 I believe the chief minister should resign. Only then there is hope for impartial investigation. Losing 600 MBBS students is also a loss of manpower for the state.
