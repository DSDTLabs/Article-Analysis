Ahmedabad: Four members of a Surat family, currently settled in the US, have gone missing while on the way to their home in Los Angeles, California, from Portland in Oregon. Authorities are fearing the worst as an SUV matching the description of the car they were travelling in was reportedly swept away in the current of a swollen river.

 Sandeep Thottapilly, 42, his wife Soumya, 38, and their children Siddhant, 12, and Saachi, 9, were travelling in a maroon Honda Pilot carrying a California registration plate at the time they went missing on April 5.
 
 Search operations have been affected due to rough weather. A notice posted on Facebook states that relatives last heard from the family on Thursday, and reported them missing over the weekend after they did not show up for their planned Friday visit.
 
 Sandeep Thottapilly’s father, Babu Subramaniam, who lives in Surat, also tweeted the issue to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj.
 
 “Respected Sushma Swaraj ji, I am a senior citizen and resident of Surat, Gujarat. My son Sandeep Thottapilly is residing in California, USA. He and his family are reported missing since last Thursday,” wrote Subramaniam. 
 
 “Would request your good office to take up this matter with concerned authorities in USA and help find my son and his family as soon as possible. We have taken help of Facebook post to reach out to more and more people in California,” he said.
 
 Swaraj assured of all possible help to Thottapilly. “I am in constant touch with our consulate in San Francisco. They are coordinating with the police. Rest assured. We will spare no effort,” Swaraj said on Twitter.
 
 According to family members, some parts of the vehicle in which the family was travelling and some clothes of kids have reportedly been found, but authorities haven’t been able to trace the family members until now.
