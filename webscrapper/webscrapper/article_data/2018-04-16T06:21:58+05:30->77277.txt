KOLKATA: A few children were injured in a near-stampede situation at   station (Kudghat) after a power-trip on a Kavi Subhas-bound train sparked panic among Poila Baisakh revellers returning home on Sunday around 9.30pm. The train suddenly stopped while entering the station. 

 The passengers even smashed window panes as they clamoured to rush out of the dark tunnel . 
 
 Services were disrupted for sometime in the   section, as the train was stopped at Netaji station, where senior   officials went to inspect the train for the source of the power-trip. A probe is on to find out what went wrong in the train. 
 
 Passengers claimed that as the train left Mahanayak Uttam Kumar station (Tollygunge), they saw sparks, after which they alerted the driver. They alleged that the driver did not pay any heed and it suddenly turned dark. 
 
 Many left their belongings while trying to get out of the claustrophobic situation.They managed to walk through the vestibules of the interconnected coaches to reach the first two compartments and get out onto the platforms.
 
 A Lalbazar officer said Metro services resumed from 10.10pm.
 
 A metro spokesperson said, "We made announcements to guide the passengers out of the train safely. It was a non-AC train. Yet some passengers broke the windows."
