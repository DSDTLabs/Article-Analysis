Ganesh has been in the film industry for 11 years and has starred in 27 films, but the one role that he hasn’t essayed yet is that of a policeman. Ganesh teams up with his   director   for  , which is set to release on May 26. And fans will be treated to seeing him play a cop in the film in his own unique style. 

  
  
 
 “From Dr Rajkumar’s days till now, every hero has wanted to don the cop costume at least once. Ganesh also had that desire. Ganesh, as cop  , has all the characteristics that the actor is known for — romance, comedy and emotions — but with added elements; he will be seen in rough and tough action sequences for the first time in Pataki,” says Manju. 
 
 Another first for the film is that Ganesh will be referred to with a new title. “He will be called Abhinaya Adhipathi Golden Star. This is a title chosen by his fans, who requested me to include it in my film,” Manju adds.
