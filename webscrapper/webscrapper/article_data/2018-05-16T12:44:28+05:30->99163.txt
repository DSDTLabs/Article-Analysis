MARGAO: A group of citizens from   on Tuesday demanded the scrapping of the planning and development authorities (PDAs) across the state, and redrafting the   by giving powers to local bodies - panchayats and municipalities - in line with the 74th Constitutional amendment.

 Avinash Tavares, Sanjeev Raiturkar, Dr Francisco   and Piedade Noronha addressed mediapersons to voice their demand. While Tavares accused the South Goa PDA of following “arbitrary procedures” in preparing the land-use map and land registry, Colaco alleged that the planning body was riddled with corruption. The group also spoke about the letter they wrote to the chief town planner demanding that Margao be excluded from the SGPDA and brought under the town and country planning (TCP) department. 
 
 “Let all the duties of planning and preparation of development plan be conducted by the local body, i.e., the Margao municipality, with the technical support of the TCP,” reads the letter signed by Tavares, Raiturkar, and Ethel Lobo. 
 
 The letter points out that the land-use map of Margao and the land-use registry kept open for public scrutiny were not prepared as per the format specified in the TCP Act, while also alleging a scam in the tender awarded to the firm for preparing the land use map. 
 
 The group, who call themselves ‘concerned citizens’, has also complained to the vigilance department against the chairperson and member secretary of the SGPDA as well as the private firm in connection with the award of tender for preparation of the land use maps of Margao and Ponda.
