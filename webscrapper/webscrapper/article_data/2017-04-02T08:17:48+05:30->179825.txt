AGRA: 
  in the run-up to UP polls,   founder   Yadav said on Saturday that Prime Minister   was right when he had said that a son who was not loyal to his father couldn’t be loyal to anyone else.

 “Ye sahi hai ki jo baap ka nahin hua, wo kisi ka nahin ho sakta,” Mulayam said, quoting Modi, in perhaps his most scathing criticism of the UP former chief minister who dislodged him as the party national president. “The (PM’s) statement and the public show of discord in the Yadav clan affected voters and led to the party’s drubbing in the elections,” Mulayam, who was in Mainpuri to inaugurate a hotel, said.
 
 The SP patriarch repeatedly referred to the fact that his son had “disrespected” him. The former defence minister also pointed out that never in the history of the country had anyone named his son the chief minister despite being active in political life, like he had done. “While people voted for me as the chief minister in 2012, I chose to make Akhilesh the CM, but he humiliated me thereafter,” Mulayam said. “I have never been insulted so much ever in my life.
 
 In the aftermath of a bitter fight between Akhilesh and Ram Gopal Yadav on one side and Mulayam and Shivpal on the other, the SP fought polls under the leadership of

 “Jab apne hi hume saja dete rahe to hum shikayat kisse karein (When our own punish us, who do we go to)?” the three-time Uttar Pradesh CM said, adding that it was a tragedy that his son had joined hands with Congress, 
  “not once but thrice”.
 
 Expressing his resentment over the “sacking” of the then Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Shivpal, Mulayam said, “He (Akhilesh) sacked his own uncle, a very hard working minister who, too, was insulted.” On whether he would float another party, he said, “The new party is yet to be formed. The final decision would be taken after consulting you (the supporters) and taking your views.”
