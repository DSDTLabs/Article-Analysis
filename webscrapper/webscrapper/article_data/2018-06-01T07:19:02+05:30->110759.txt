CHENNAI: The Madras   on Thursday directed the Nelampur police to register a case against   leader H  , if cognizable offence is made out of the derogatory comments he made against Rajya Sabha MP  .

 Justice N Sathishkumar passed the order on a plea moved by K R Kukesh, president of Tamil Nadu Isai Vellalargal Nala Sangam.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, the judge noted that there is no point in keeping the complaint pending without taking any action.
 
 “Either a case should be registered if cognizable offence is made out or the complaint must be closed if prima facie no case is made out,” the judge said.
 
 According to the petitioner, on April 19, Raja made a derogatory   against Kanimozhi on  . Claiming that the remark has spoiled the social reputation of Kanimozhi and her father- former chief minister M Karunanidhi, the petitioner preferred a complaint with the Nelampur police on April 23. Since the police refused to accept his complaint, he sent it through post on April 24. 
 
 Now, alleging that even after receipt of the complaint the police failed to act, the petitioner approached the high court.
