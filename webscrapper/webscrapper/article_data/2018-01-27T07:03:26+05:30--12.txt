MANGALURU: Former Union minister B Janardhana Poojary’s much-anticipated autobiography, ‘Saalamelada Sangraama’, sold more than 1,000 copies within minutes of its release on Friday. The book launch at Kudroli Gokarnatheshwara temple also brought together political rivals on stage – alongside Poojary was state minister Ramanath Rai who is part of a rival faction in  , and Rai’s own bete noire, RSS leader  . 

 Dozens of people who had gathered for the launch were disappointed as the books sold out, leading to a war of words. Poojary assured them that he would release more copies on the eve of Maha Shivaratri, on February 13. Priced at Rs 300, the first edition was sold at a throwaway price of Rs 50. Poojary said he wanted everybody to read his autobiography, which he had “brought out with utmost honesty”.
 
 “I have touched upon several topics in my autobiography. The book will speak for itself. All the ups and downs in my life are covered in the book. I have always wanted to do good to society,” he said.
 
 Rai, the state minister for forests, environment and ecology, was an unexpected guest, since his fallout with Poojary is well-known. The two seemed to have buried the hatchet, with Poojary holding Rai’s hand and hailing him as a man of development. Harikrishna Bantwal, who walked out of Congress and joined   and has been siding with Poojary against Rai, stood nearby. Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat and Rai, though on the same stage, did not even exchange glances at each other, indicating the animosity between them.
 
 ‘Saalamelada Sangraama’ is named after a controversial loan mela for the poor that Poojary initiated during his tenure as Union minister of state for finance. There was an attempt to murder Poojary, to pre-empt the announcement of the mela. The book is written by   as dictated by Poojary. The autobiography, which is in Kannada, will be brought out in English and Hindi.
