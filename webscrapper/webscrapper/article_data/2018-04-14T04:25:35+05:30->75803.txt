MUMBAI: Farmers stopped by   officials from setting up temporary stalls in Kandivli protested outside   by dumping cratefuls of their produce on Friday.

 A protester said that most of them were from Osmanabad in Marathwada and had wanted to set up a farmer   on the model proposed by the government, in   but were turned away by BMC staff.
 
 “The government has allowed growers to sell fruits and   outside the AMPC markets,” a   said. “But we were not being allowed to sell our produce by the BMC officials, so we decided to dump the vegetables outside Mantralaya.”
 
 They said farmers from outside the state were being allowed to sell their produce anywhere in the city but not them. The farmers said they had transported their produce to the metropolis in the hope of realising a profit because prices back home were low.
 
 “It is not cheap for us to bring vegetables to Mumbai from Osmanabad, but we came hoping for a good price,” another farmer said.
 
 The state in 2016 had amended the APMC Act and de-listed fruits and vegetables to allow cultivators to sell fruit and vegetables directly in the open market. The move was aimed at getting rid of middlemen. In the wake of the decision, 126 weekly markets have sprung up in the city, Thane and Navi Mumbai.
 
 Police detained the farmers following the  . An officer said they were released by evening.
