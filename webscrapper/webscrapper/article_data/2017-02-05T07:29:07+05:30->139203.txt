CHENNAI: Power consumers in Tamil Nadu will be spared of any tariff hike for one more year as the state utility expects to break even next year without any hike. There won't be any tariff hike for 2017-18 as per the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation's   (ARR) submitted to   (TNERC) for the next financial year.
Tangedco, in its proposal submitted before the   Yojana (Uday), mentioned that there would be no increase in tariff for the next two years (till 2018-19). The discom had joined the Uday scheme last month only.
 
 “During negotiations with the Union power ministry and even in the final document presented by   to the ministry, we have mentioned that there would be no tariff increase in 2017-18 and 2018-19. It is based only on this that we submitted the ARR to TNERC, which is mandatory every year,“ said a senior Tangedco official.
 
 Even otherwise, the financials of Tangedco are in a better position owing to plug ging of leakages in transmission and installation of digital meters. “Except for the outstanding debt, which made us join the Uday scheme, the current financial position of the corporation is better and we are confident of breaking even soon,“ he said.
 
 As per the ARR submitted to TNERC, Tangedco is expected to realise `49,827.13 crore as revenue from tariff at the existing rates for the next financial year. The government compensation for subsidising power is expected to be Rs 2,343.79 crore. “On account of fixing digital meters alone, we expect the revenue to increase by 25% and with better availability of power supply , we expect to realise higher revenue by supplying power as demanded by commercial and industrial consumers,“ the official said.
