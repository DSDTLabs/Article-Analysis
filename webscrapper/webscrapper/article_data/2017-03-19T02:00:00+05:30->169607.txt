PATNA: The   (BERC)’s eighth and last public hearing for accepting feedback from stakeholders on the power tariff for 2017-18, concluded on Saturday.

 According to sources, a large number of objections were received during the hearings against the proposed tariff hike. A final decision regarding the same will be taken by the end of this month. 
 
 A recent order of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APPTEL), New Delhi is likely to reflect in the tariff order for 2017-18, which will be effective from April 1.
 
 In its order passed on November 25 last year, APPTEL had set aside the BERC order of March 21 last year, preventing the two discoms from increasing the tariff for 2016-17.
 
 “We held eight public hearings after we received power tariff revision proposals from the two power discoms (distribution companies) of the state energy department. We will take into consideration the objections received from various stakeholders during the hearings before giving our decision on the tariff hike proposals,,” said BERC member Rajiv Amit on Saturday.
 
 The BERC is a three-member regulatory body entrusted with the task of fixing electricity tariff for all types of energy consumers every year. There has not been any hike in power tariff during the last three years. Sources said the BERC was likely to accept the proposals of the discoms this time in the light of the APPTEL order.
 
 As per the proposals of the discoms, urban and rural power consumers will have to shell out Rs1.27- 2 per unit, translating into a hike of 20- 21% on the overall bill in 2017-18.
