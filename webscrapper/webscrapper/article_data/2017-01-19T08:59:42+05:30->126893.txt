AMARAVATI: The capital is gripped with tension as police took the villages into control ahead of opposition leader  's visit on Thursday.

 Special police have been deputed to the villages Jagan is expected to visit. he will be interacting with farmers and Dalits during the day long visit.
 
 While farmers who continue to resist the state government's attempts to take over the green fields make elaborate arrangements for the visit, farmers who already parted with their lands under the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS), are planning to confront the opposition leader. A majority of the ryots, who joined the LPS, are TDP sympathisers and welcome the capital.
 
 YSRCP is claiming that Jagan's visit is neither to oppose the location of the capital city nor disturb the state government's plan to construct a dream capital city. Party is contending that it is the duty of the main opposition to point out the government's lapses and work as a pressure group to make the government help victims. Mangalagiri legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, who is leading the rebellious farmers, is in the forefront in making arrangements for Jagan's tour despite policy restrictions.
