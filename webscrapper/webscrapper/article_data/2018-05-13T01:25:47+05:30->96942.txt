NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has ordered that distribution of   to those who did not avail it for three consecutive months, from January to March, be stopped till they get their verification done by food and supply officers (FSOs). The government's food supplies and consumer affairs department has directed officials to hold a special drive for "detailed verification" of beneficiaries who have not availed rations from fair price shops in their areas for the three consecutive months. 

  FSOs have been directed to continue with their "statutory duties" for addition and deletion of names of beneficiaries in existing cards, and issuance, cancellation and modification of ration cards, an official said. 
 
  In March, Food and Civil Supplies Minister   had directed officials to stop the cancellation of existing ration cards and immediately, put on hold the process of making new ones till further orders. The direction was issued after the department's data showed that around 4 lakh ration card holders did not collect their ration for two months. PTI
