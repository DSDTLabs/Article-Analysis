HYDERABAD: Taking strong exception to the jailing and handcuffing of farmers by the TRS government in the state,   official spokesperson and MP   said the   will continue to fight for the farmers. He said under the   regime, suicides in the farm sector have increased. 

 Speaking at Gandhi Bhavan here, he pointed out that everyday, 35 farmers are committing suicide after being unable to get remunerative price for their produce. He challenged the NDA government to spell out the benefits of Fasal insurance scheme to farmers. 
 
 "The Fasal Yojana is being implemented only to benefit insurance companies. While the farmers pay 17,184 crore as premium in this scheme, the companies have paid 10,376 crore as compensation. This is nothing but looting the farmer. In the last three years, farm suicides have almost doubled. There is no word about the implementation of the Swaminathan committee report," said Shukla. 
 
 He said farmers who raised commercial crops have lost heavily under the NDA rule while corporate companies have profited by cutting down the prices. He questioned as to why is the government not able to give remunerative price to major crops even as suicides are on the rise. PCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy raised objection to Amit Shah visiting Congress-dominated areas and trying to flare up communal tensions.
