Rajkot: The officials at the Talala market yard of Junagadh announced on Thursday that the auction for famous kesar mangoes will commence from May 3. They added that the production of kesar mangoes is expected to be 20-25% less compare to last year. This was one of the reasons for late auction. Last year, the auction in market yard began on April 22.

 Similar auctions of kesar mangoes will begin simultaneously in Dhari, Kodinar and Una market yards. The decision to start auction in Talala market yard from May 3 was taken at a meeting of traders and commission agents on Tuesday. 
 
 Last year, over 11 lakh boxes (10kg each) of kesar mangoes were auctioned over 59 days in Talala market yard. Its secretary H H Garsania said, “Big traders in Ahmedabad’s Naroda fruit market enter into a deal with mango orchid owners before the season starts. Other traders get mango supply from our market yard.” 
 
 A kesar mango trader from the region Tushar Dhamelia said, “When it was compulsory for traders to purchase farm produce from APMC, all mangoes used to be sold in the market yard. But after government gave relaxation for fruits, nearly 40% of total mango production is sold directly in the retail market.” 
 
 Talala market yard has mango packing house for export. According to sources, nearly 25 tonne of mangoes has been exported to European countries over the past few weeks. Also, last year, 275 tonne of mangoes were exported to America, Europe, Australia and Dubai in the entire season from the packing house.
