JALANDHAR: Former MLA, MP and currently Punjab   vice-president Satnam Singh   (55) passed away on Sunday night after remaining ill for over a month and half. He had suffered brain stroke and had undergone brain surgery at a private hospital in Mohali, but did not recover.

 A prominent Dalit face of the Congress, Kainth was one of the original foot soldiers of Kanshi Ramâ€™s BSP in Punjab and became an MLA from Banga constituency in 1992 and Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly, the only time BSP had a respectable presence in assembly elections in the state. He was not married when he became Leader of Opposition. He hailed from Sotran village, near Banga.
 
 Though he rose from the ranks of a reactionary movement but Kainth always remained a courteous and soft spoken leader. He jumped into politics when he was still a college student in 1980s and while remaining political active he did his post-graduation in economics. Later, he parted ways with the BSP and formed Bahujan Samaj Morcha and became a Lok Sabha member from Phillaur constituency in 1998 with support of SAD. However, later he joined the   and contested two assembly elections but could not win.
