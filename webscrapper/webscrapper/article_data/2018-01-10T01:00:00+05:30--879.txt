ARA: Even on the freezing and foggy Monday morning, there was visible warmth in the smile of Shyam Bihari Ojha, a farmer of Babhangaon under the Krishna Garh police station area of Bhojpur district. 

 It was not so a couple of days back. Before the onset of the current biting   spell, he, along with other farmers of the village, was a worried lot due to relatively warmer weather for this time of the winter. 
 
 “A short spell of cold spell is conducive for the healthy growth of the wheat, gram and masur crops. Look at the wheat crops now! cold weather has infused a new life in the crops. Otherwise, our wheat and other crops were on the verge of being destroyed due to unusual warm weather this time of the year before the severe cold set in,” Shyam Bihari said with a beaming face as he has only one acre land and the yield from it is the only means of sustenance for his family of five members. 
 
 Standing beside him, Raju Ojha and Jeetu Kumar, comparatively richer than Shyam Bihari, also said the current cold spell saved their crops. 
 
 Not only farmers, but traders of room heaters, blowers and immersion rods are also happy with the sudden chill. Back in Ara, the authorized dealer of reputed brands of electrical appliances in the Kamla Market at the Chitra Toli Road said, “In just four days since the severe cold conditions started, all my room heaters, blowers and immersion rods have been sold out. All our worries have vanished now as the sale was very poor before the onset of the current cold spell.” 
 
 The biting cold is also sending the woollen garment sellers laughing all the way to the bank. A gloves and woollen caps seller at Bichli Road said he had to place fresh order as his stock was sold out in the last few days.
