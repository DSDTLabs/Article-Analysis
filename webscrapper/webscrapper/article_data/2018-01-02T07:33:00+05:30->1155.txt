ROHTAK: A woman, who had earlier complained having been raped, tried to immolate herself at the office of   superintendent of police (SP) on Monday alleging that no progress had been made in her case.

 However, timely intervention by the police personnel in the security zone foiled her plan.
 
 According to information, the woman had lodged the complaint a month ago.
 
 The woman alleged that none of the accused named in the complaint had been arrested and apparently the police were trying to shield them. On Monday, she reached the SP office along with her family members.
 
  told   over the phone that the matter had come to his notice and was being investigated. Responding to a question over delay in action against the rape accused,   said the evidence and probe so far had not led to any concrete evidence.
