KOLKATA: State finance secretary (budget)   on Tuesday evening wrote a long post on  , describing the wretched condition his parents were living in in Agra and how helpless he felt as a son, apparently in an attempt to whip up sympathy over his inability to get a transfer out of  . Merely three days ago on Saturday, he had posted about the state refusing to grant him a transfer, which created ripples in the administrative circles.

 “I have done full justice to my job in most demanding situations but I can't absolve myself of my responsibilities as a son only because I am a government servant,“ wrote the 1999 batch IAS officer in a nearly 800-word post, which he named, `Feelings of an unworthy son'. Another IAS officer pointed out: “Yadav has been denied appointment by the chief minister twice and now, he wants to draw sympathy through his Facebook posts.“ But, the officer said, the state could not release anyone at present owing to a severe shortage of IAS and IPS officers.
 
 On Tuesday , however, Yadav did not mention his grie dav did not mention his grievance over transfer; rather, he wrote how helpless he felt as he could not reach out to his parents or support them when they needed him the most: “I could not help feeling 'sad' and ashamed of myself when I heard my father is so depressed. I understand that it is my inability to take care of my parents... I believe my parents need all the love, care and respect in their old age and as their son.“ Yadav said his father (82), was down with complications of the heart, liver, lungs, kidney , eyes, nerves and bones.“He has unknowingly taken expired medicines, wrong medications, and skipped his medicines as he finds it difficult to read the small fonts,“ he wrote.
