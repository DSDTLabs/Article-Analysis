PANAJI: Drawing flak from various groups fighting the Mormugao Port Trust’s (MPT) proposal to increase  , town and country planning minister and leader of the Goa Forward Party   told TOI that the party is against any pollution in Goa.

 The party has been targeted following their support to the MPT’s proposal to enhance coal handling capabilities on grounds of the state’s dependence on power from central grids. Party spokesperson   had said that since the grids require coal to generate power, Goa should allow its ports for the imports to come. However, groups such as Goa against coal (GAC) highlighted that imported coal is not used for power generation.
 
 “I would like to clarify that Goa Forward is against any source of pollution in the state. We have been targeted because we had been vocal on various issues in the past. The party is strongly against open handling of coal at our ports and would not tolerate it. If needed, we would not allow it to happen and I believe the chief minister also holds the same opinion about the issue. Coal handling at MPT can only happen if it is done in a closed manner and under strict monitoring,” the Fatorda MLA said, adding that people should not jump the gun and let the process go by the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report.
