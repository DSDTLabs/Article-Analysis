 Karnataka elections will be the beginning of our victory. We will also win in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. We will return to power in the Centre under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. What Congress did in 70 years for the country is being reversed by Modi with his politics of hate.
 
 
 
 It has nothing to do with Congress. In fact, the party and the state government have never interfered in the case. The law will take its own course.
