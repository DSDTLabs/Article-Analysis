NAVI MUMBAI: A historical treasure has been dug up from the  . Over the last couple of days, students of a college in Pune have stumbled upon ancient artefacts-a piece of what appears to be a bullet, a coin and other paraphernalia from a part of the fort. 

 Students of Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute have been working closely at the site with officials from the Archaeological Survey of India to get a peek into the lives of people and soldiers from the distant past.
 
 The vice-chancellor of Deccan College, Vasant Shinde, who has also been working at the fort, told TOI: "Since Sunday, several objects have been found during excavation work. These include a piece of a lead bullet, a coin with some inscription besides several pieces of pottery." 
 
 Shinde said that students and faculty from the archaeology department have been digging near the entrance of the fort in Mahad for the last 10 days. "Clearly, at some point in time, people may have been staying in this part of the fort entrance. It is basically a vast, open complex."
 
 The era to which these excavated objects date back is not yet known. Studies will be carried out to confirm the period when these excavated objects were in use. 
 
 Archaeology officer from Raigad, S Kamble, told TOI that "Further research will point to the objects that were used in the olden days, going back at least three centuries." 
 
 Chhatrapati   had made   fort his capital in 1674 AD. His samadhi is housed in one portion of the fort.
 
 On Sunday, BJP leader Sambhajiraje Bhosale, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, visited the fort to examine the excavated artefacts.
