JAIPUR: Continuing its focus on upgradation of roads in rural interiors, the government made a good allocation of money in the Budget on Monday.

 A provision of Rs 766 crore was made to connect the remaining gram panchayats to district headquarters through ‘Gramin Gaurav Path Yojna’ and ‘Missing Link Yojna’.
 
  is a scheme through which many villages and hamlets in rural interiors are to be connected to nearby village panchayats and later to the district headquarters.
 
 There is also a proposal for upgradation and renewal of 5,000 kms of roads in the state for which a provision of Rs 800 crore has been made.
 
 However, the task seems onerous as the state is heading for assembly elections later this year. A provision has been made for developing some selected mega and state highways as emergency air strips. Work is already in progress on Phalodi-Jaisalmer and   national highways and in future, 3 to 4 more mega highways would be added in the scheme.
