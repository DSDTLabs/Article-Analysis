NEW DELHI: US consultancy firm Bain & Company prefers India to China, when it comes to sourcing global talent.

 Bain's new global MD  , who is the first Asian to head the firm in 44 years, said half the company's workforce in India serves clients beyond the borders of the country.
 
 "India has one thing from our selfish perspective that China doesn't. India is a source of global talent for us," said Maceda. "Indians are global thinkers, native English speakers and are willing to travel, which is not the case in China."
 
 Maceda, who was born in the Philippines but raised in the US, told TOI India is one of the fastest growing markets in APAC, which is the fastest growing market for Bain. "We are doing a lot of work for strategic transformation. That's a sign of the maturity of the market," he said.
 
 He said if one entered China 20 years ago, one would do work for global companies such as,   or   that were wanting to enter the country. But currently, India has national champions looking to go global. "How do I deal with digital," said Maceda. "Every retail company is thinking about the next level of growth and digital is one of the big themes that's enabling all of that."
 
 He said India Inc is dominated by family conglomerates, who while dealing with global forces, are finding that historic business models are not fully-equipped to push for the next level of growth. "So, you are also dealing with generational dynamics and working out new ownership models," he said.
 
 When asked about the role of leaders in the current business scenario, which is often being disrupted by technology, Maceda said it is one of the main reasons why tenures of leaders are getting shorter.
 
 "The average tenure of a CEO in the US is five years," he said. "A leader needs to continuously build a set of new skills for the new business models of the industry but it's not in people's nature to keep adding skills without rewiring their thinking."
