Noida: An association of famers in Greater Noida has suggested that workers be engaged under the NREGA scheme to clear fields after harvest, coming up with their own solution to tackle the burning of crop leftovers that causes air pollution.

 Ahead of the Union budget, the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KSS) has made the proposal to the Prime Minister’s Office that the rural job scheme be extended for those who could be engaged to clear the fields.
 
 “Crop waste is burnt by   after the harvest because there is no adequate use of the stalks. While fines and other penal measures have not been fruitful so far, we have suggested that the clearing of the fields be linked to the MNREGA scheme. This will provide employment to villagers as well as bring a practical solution to the crop-burning issue,” said Dushyant Nagar, the convener of KSS.
 
 The farmers have also highlighted that human-animal conflict has been increasing over the years and crops are being regularly damaged by animals.
 
 “There is a need for urgent intervention in terms of tackling animals that are damaging crops on the farms. A way to relocate them to other environs has to be initiated,” Nagar added.
 
 The farmers have also stressed the need for enhancing irrigation facility.
 
 “There is scope for improvement when it comes to agriculture. We have put across our views. We feel the crop burning issue can be tackled if people are engaged through employment instead of imposing fines,” he said.
