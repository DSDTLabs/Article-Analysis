AMARKANTAK: Prime Minister   is going to land some 18km from Narmada temple on Monday. Chief minister Shivraj Singh did so on Sunday. But why not land in   itself, which has a perfectly good helipad just 300m from the temple? The chief priest of NarmadaTemple, Umesh Dwivedi, says he has the answer.

 “Flying over Ma Narmada is forbidden,” says the priest who will perform puja when Modi arrives here for the culmination of   that has traversed a dozen districts in 148 days, touching crores of people. People believe the local legend with all conviction, and politicians don’t dare cross the line, either.
 
 “Anyone who did so in past lost their job. Former prime ministers Morarji Desai and Indira Gandhi made the mistake and paid for it. Ma Narada is our creator. People must respect her,” Dwivedi says.
 
 Several leaders fear losing their post and avoid flying over Amarkantak. The chief minister of bordering state Chattisgarh, Raman Singh is one of them, said another priest, Narendra Dwivedi.
 
 So, the helipad which sits in a 125-acre open ground has been made the venue for Monday’s mega event. A large tent is being erected and preparation has been on since April 17, say officials.
 
 A new helipad was built on Anuppur Amarkantak Road. The PM will land here and make the rest of the journey by road. He is expected to be in Amarkantak by 1.30pm, say sources. “The PM is scheduled to be in the temple at 2.10pm. He will perform the abhishek here,” the senior priest said.
 
 After offering prayers, he will address a gathering of lakhs. While the state government has told NGT that 1.5 lakh people will attend, officials handling the affairs are expecting around 5 lakh.
 
 Chief minister Chouhan visited Amarkantak on Sunday evening to take stock of final preparations. Trusted loyalists of the CM, like minister Bhoopendra Singh and Rampal Singh, are among those supervising the operations along with an army of leaders and officials.
