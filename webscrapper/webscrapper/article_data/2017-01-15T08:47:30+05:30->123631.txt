ROHTAK: As an Olympic wrestler   was a trendsetter, whether it was his signature moves or winning medals on the mat.

 He has now taken a muscular stand outside the sporting world as well, by accepting just a token Re 1 as dowry when he weds on January 16 in Delhi.
 
 The bride-to-be, Sheetal, is the daughter of Haryana Congressman Jaibhagwan Sharma.
 
 “I saw my family struggle to collect dowry for the girls of the family,” said the 34-year-old who got engaged at Murthal in   on Saturday. 
 
 “As a result, I decided on two things while growing up — I will excel in wrestling and I will not accept dowry. My first dream has been realised and now it is time to keep my second promise,”   Dutt said.
 
 The Olympian said how he wished his father Rammehar Dutt and his first guru Master Satbir Singh had been alive to see him fulfil both his promises. 
 
 Yogeshwar’s mother Sushila Devi said his marriage was a special occasion and they would accept Re 1 as a mark of good omen from the bride’s family, but nothing else.
