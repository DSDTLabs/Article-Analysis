Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of   in a recent order overruled the objection raised by   (CIIMC) director Sunil Mishra in the PIL in Rs59.29 lakh scholarship scam.

 A bench comprising justice   and justice Swapna Joshi has marked the matter for hearing on May 2.
 
 Mishra had said that the charge of fraud or obtaining reimbursement at wrong rate is itself misconceived or erroneous. He also drew the bench’s attention towards the HC judgement delivered on December 23, 2015. The case relates to a petition filed by Mishra, in which he had alleged that Nagpur University had de-recognized 252 colleges.
 
 However, amicus curiae Shyam Mohta too drew the court’s attention towards paragraph 18 of the same judgement. “The court had asked the vice chancellor to provide documents sought by Mishra. He had also made several allegations against the university. Thus, the university had secured a stay on this order from the Supreme Court. Though this stay order wouldn’t have any impact on the current PIL regarding Rs59.29lakh, still the HC has granted time to Mishra till the SC decides the earlier matter,” Mohta said.
 
 “We have looked into the judgement. We find that the question of charging excessive tuition fees or claiming refund therefore from State government was not expressly involved, but the controversy was about non-existent courses, non-existent students and, therefore, the fraud practised upon state government,” the court stated.
 
 The court added, “We, therefore, hold that objection to consideration of present PIL on the ground of stay by apex court is erroneous and misconceived. However, we are inclined to grant request to Mishra to give him time to place this order before the apex court. Mishra points out that the apex court is likely to decide the controversy itself on April 28, 2017, and matter is listed on that date.”
