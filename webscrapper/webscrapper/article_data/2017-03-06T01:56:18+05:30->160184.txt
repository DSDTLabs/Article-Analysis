KOLKATA: A 64-year-old woman was severely injured when the app cab she was travelling in was hit by a Kalitala-Howrah route minibus at a traffic signal in   crossing around 9am on Sunday. 

 The victim, Gouri Roy Chowdhury — a resident of Tollygunge — was administered multiple stitches as she received injuries from glass shards on the back of her head. Later, she was taken home by policemen and her relatives. Chowdhry was on way to her sister’s place at Bangur Avenue.
 
  Some passengers, who were travelling in the minibus, alleged that the bus had been speeding for long, hit a motorbike near   station and skipped three signals before hitting the car while trying to skip the Rasbehari signal. After hitting the app cab, the bus went past the signal to the other side of the road where the driver stopped the bus and fled.
 
 “We asked the driver to slow down but he did not listen. After he hit the car, some of us also fell on the floor of the bus. When we tried to catch him, he stopped the bus and fled,” said one of the passengers. Nine others in the bus were also injured and taken to MR Bangur Hospital for first aid.
 
 When TOI visited her house beside Tollygunge police station, her domestic help said that she had gone to her sister’s house and was undergoing treatment there. Cops have seized the bus but the driver is absconding.
