HYDERABAD: The illegal refugees case, in which   nationals had created fake   cards and other identity documents to obtain passports, has been handed over to the   (SIT) of Hyderabad police. 

 The Special Investigation Team will probe how the accused obtained Indian passports using fake Aadhaar cards with the help of racketeers involved in trafficking Myanmar nationals. As the issue of illegal refugees has become a security concern for officials, the police has seriously taken up this case.
 
 The Special Investigation Team re-registered a case of cheating, forgery and under Passport Act after the case was transferred to them from   police station.
 
 Myanmar national Nazarul Islam was residing in   in Kanchanbagh and obtained a fake voter card and Aadhaar card with fictitious names and used the Aadhaar card to obtain a passport for his wife with the help of house owner  , a videographer. "In November 2014, NIA arrested Mohammed Khali, a Myanmar national from Balapur, for his links with the West Bengal blast case. So the terror threat is always there," said an SIT official.
 
 Police will be grilling the agents involved in facilitating the identity cards to the illegal refugees. Cops said even the legal refugees were granted only refugee cards and could not get ID cards.
 
 "Obtaining a passport is a serious issue. We are checking how the accused got the passport. The nexus of agents and illegal migrants will be broken," said the investigating official.
 
 From 2015 to 2017, there have been five instances of Myanmar nationals getting caught with fake documents.
