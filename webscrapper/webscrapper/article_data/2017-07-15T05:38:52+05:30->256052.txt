NOIDA: The district administration has started an effort to improve the   system in the congested Sector 18 Metro station area through technical solutions offered by private firms. 

 A meeting between the district magistrate and representatives of at least five companies was held on Wednesday afternoon at the district magistrate’s camp office in Sector 27 where they were asked to contribute in the development of different sectors including traffic and education.
 
 The meeting was held after the district administration and the officials of Nasscom, a consortium of IT companies, decided to partner for certain projects.
 
 “Nasscom had expressed interest in helping us with technology for various projects through the companies under it. One of the companies, Bosch, has shown interest in management of traffic at Sector 18 Metro station and the open parking system at the spot. They will conduct a survey soon and check the possibility of what infrastructure and technical solutions are required to improve the traffic management in the area,” district magistrate B N Singh told TOI.
 
 While Bosch did not share details, district officials said that installation of   cameras would be a part of the initiative after a survey in the next six months. A similar survey has been completed at four other busy intersections of the city–Rajnigandha, DM office intersection, Stadium Crossing and 12/22 intersection — under a similar arrangement and they had been asked to provide infra-red cameras for monitoring traffic violations. However, there has been no headway in the process. The companies will provide funds for the project from their corporate social responsibility ( ) funds.
