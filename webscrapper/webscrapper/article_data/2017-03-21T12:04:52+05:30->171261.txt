YAVATMAL: The Shiv Sena finally entered into an alliance with the   (NCP) to gain power in Yavatmal Zilla Parishad (ZP).

 In the 61-member ZP, the Shiv Sena has 20 members, while the NCP has 11.
 
 The announcement was made during a joint press conference held at the government guest house on Monday. From Shiv Sena, deputy chief Vishwanath Nerurkar, minister of state for Revenue Sanjay Rathod, sitting MP Bhavana Gawali, district chiefs Santosh Dhawle and Vishwas Nandekar were present, while the NCP was represented by sitting MLA Manoharrao Naik, former MLC Sandeep Bajoria and district unit chief Nanabhau Gadbaile.
 
 However, the leaders refused to name candidates for the coveted posts of president and vice-president, the elections to which is scheduled on March 21.
 
 After the election in 2012, the Shiv Sena and NCP forged a post-poll alliance and ruled the ZP for 2.5 years with the posts of president and vice-president retained by NCP.
 
 Thereafter, NCP joined hands with Congress and ruled the ZP for the remaining 2.5 years by sharing the two coveted posts.
 
 In the meantime, MoS for home Dr Ranjeet Patil has reached Yavatmal and is camping at the government guest house. Bhavana Gawali is also camping at the same place, and there is every possibility of a final talk between the two leaders soon. Dr Patil has come as an emissary of chief minister  .
 
 The   was watching the latest development of Shiv Sena keenly to forge an alliance. But since the local leaders were averse to any such proposal, the post-poll alliance could not materialize.
