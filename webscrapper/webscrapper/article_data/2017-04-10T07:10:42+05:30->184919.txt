JAIPUR: In a breakthrough, a 68-year-old patient, suffering from congestive heart failure recovered after taking   medicine.

 The patient, Kamal Vyas, became unconscious at a temple in the city in December. His relatives rushed him to a city-based private heart hospital, where the doctors conducted two-dimensional echocardiography and diagnosed that he had suffered congestive heart failure.
 
 “The doctors administered some injections for thinning blood. They also recommended surgery of the heart and even recommended a heart transplant,” Tarun Vyas, son of the patient, said.
 
 The family preferred homeopathy for his treatment. 
 
 “When he (Kamal) was brought to us, he had abnormal heart sounds (murmurs). We also found fluid accumulation in his lungs. There was swelling (edema) in the legs. It was a complicated case. We informed the patient that his condition is quite serious,” Dr Vikas Kumar Saini, a homeopathy doctor said . Dr Saini said the patient had global hypokinesis, it is a condition wherein the heart is generally very weak with possibility of mild to severe blockages of the coronary arteries.
 
 Dr Saini said that first he provided him with diuretic mother tincture, which helped him in getting rid of fluid accumulated in his body. Besides, the doctor said that he had used some medicines, which are used for some other purposes like for relaxing muscles. That helped the patient to recover.
 
 He said that it was just like a miracle that he showed improvement in just 25 to 30 days. His heart functioning has increased from 30% to 40%. Also, other parameters like blood pressure and pulse have become normal, which were quite irregular at the time when he was brought to them.
