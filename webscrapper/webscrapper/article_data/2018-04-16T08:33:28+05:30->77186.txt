COLVA:   surrounds the disappearance of a youth, Ashish Naik, 31, from   since April 8. Police have registered a missing report after receiving a complaint from his brother   and his friend Melencia Fernandes.

 Fernandes said she has forwarded the text message that she had received from Ashish to the police. Ashish has allegedly claimed in the message that he was being harrassed and threatened by some people. 
 
 In September last year, Ashish had lodged a complaint with the Colva police stating that a Benaulim panchayat member, in connivance with some electricity department officials, illegally cut some trees from his property. 
 
 TOI had reported the matter on October 6.
 
 Fernandes said that since then, Ashish was under pressure to withdraw the complaint and was even offered Rs 50,000 for the same. Fernandes alleged that recently some electricity department officials visited Ashish’s house and threatened to disconnect the power supply even though no arrears were pending. Later, to pressurise him a local even assaulted him, she alleged. Fernandes told the police that on April 8, Ashish had informed her that he was travelling to Karwar with some tourists and would speak to her later that evening, but she didn’t get a call. Since her calls went unanswered for the next two days, Fernandes decided to lodge a complaint.
 
 Colva police inspector   said Ashish’s two-wheeler was found at the   bus stand and Fernandes and Avinash’s statements have been recorded. He said Fernandes has provided the police with an SMS naming some persons, but they are yet to be summoned.   said Ashish’s mobile was initially traced to Pune, but could not be located since the last two days.
