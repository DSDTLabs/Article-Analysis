NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   is starting another round of re-engagement with neighbourhood leaders. After his visit to Nepal next week, when he is expected to repair frayed ties between the two countries,   is also expected to travel to Santiniketan to meet with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh   on May 25. 

 
 Sheikh Hasina will be in India to inaugurate the Bangladesh Bhavan at Vishwa Bharati, which includes a museum showcasing Rabindranath Tagore’s association with Bangladesh. In Nepal, Modi will fulfil an old wish — he will offer prayers at the Janaki temple in Janakpur, as well as address a public meeting. Modi will go on to Kathmandu to meet Prime Minister K P Oli where connectivity and investment will dominate discussions. 
 
 The last week of April saw the first trial run of a bus service between Kathmandu and Dhaka, passing through India, part of a sub-regional connectivity agreement. This time Modi will enter Nepal from Patna, making Janakpur his first stop. Hasina had tied the inauguration of the Bangladesh Bhavan to the Teesta deal, but in recent months she has done a rethink after it became clear that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is in no mood to relent. 
 
 Instead the Bangladesh culture minister Assaduzzaman Noor was sent to Santiniketan to prepare for her visit. “We want this Bhavan to be inaugurated by the end of May. It will be a matter of great significance if the Prime Ministers of both India and Bangladesh attend the inauguration programme of this cultural complex. We believe that this Bhavan will be a centre of attraction at Santiniketan,” the culture minister was quoted as saying. 
 
 Modi will travel to Indonesia in June for a bilateral summit with President Joko Widodo, going on to Singapore to deliver the keynote address at the Shangri La Dialogue, the first Indian PM to do so. He is expected to lay out India’s Indo-Pacific strategy. The first week of June will also see him back in China to attend the SCO summit.
