MUMBAI: The Delhi based operator who got the tender to run civic buses in   was on Friday caught red-handed bribing a local BJP MLA.
 
 The   (MBMC) standing committee on June 29 gave its approval for appointing Delhi based   to run its buses on a contract basis. The ruling BJP had opposed the proposal. The Shiv Sena and Congress had voted in favour of the tender. Shyama Shyam happened to be the sole bidders.
 
 On Friday, the operator   (55) was caught by the Thane   (ACB) giving Rs 25 lakh bribe to BJP corporator and MLA Narendra Mehta. A clerk of the civic transport department Anand Gabale (38) was also caught by the ACB.
 
 The   (MBMT) buses were earlier run by Ulhasnagar based Kestrel Infrastructure Private Limited. MBMC had begun operating the buses on contract basis since 2005. The frequency of the 50 buses had drastically reduced since December 2015 due to poor maintenance attributed to lack of depots. 
 
 The bus operator approached Mehta on June 29 and offered to give him Rs 25 lakh to vote in favour of the tender. Despite the BJP voting against the tender, the operator continued to offer the money. Mehta approached the ACB who laid on trap. On Friday, when Kathoria was handing over the cash to Mehta in his office, the ACB nabbed him.
 
 The contractor was to recruit drivers and undertake maintenance of the buses. The fares were to be collected by the MBMC and the contractor was to get a fixed amount per kilometer.
