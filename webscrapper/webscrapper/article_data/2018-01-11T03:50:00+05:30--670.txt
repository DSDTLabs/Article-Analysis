Panaji: The state cabinet has decided to revise the pay scales of head   (dog handlers, band and armourers) and bring them on a par with head constables (executive) with retrospective effect from January 2014. 

 The state government had upgraded the pay scales of head constables (executive) in the year 2008, following which others within the force urged it to consider revising their pay scales, too. 
 
 The current proposal intends to bring uniformity in the pay scales of the categories of head constables. It was examined in consultation with the finance department, which gave its approval on November 15 last year.
