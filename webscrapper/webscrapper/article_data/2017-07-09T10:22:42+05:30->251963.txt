TRICHY: A Home Guards jawan who lost his honorary job following an emotional speech he delivered in support of jallikattu during the students’ protest in January is running from pillar to post to get reinstated. In the latest effort, he submitted a petition to the principal district judge   on Saturday to forgive him for his speech and order his reinstatement.

 G Belson, 40, who worked in   in Trichy lost his job following his speech in front of thousands of students near MGR statue on January 21. “Being a patriotic person and a supporter of jallikattu, I was unable to control my emotions when the students’ protest against the ban was at its peak. Without realising my responsibility as a home guard jawan, I addressed the gathering to express my solidarity with the protesters. I realised my mistakes after I was reprimanded by the officials and denied job in home guards,” he said in the petition. 
 
 Though his job in home guards earned him only Rs 150 a day, he held it close to his heart because of the services his forefathers had rendered to the armed services. 
 
 “I wanted to join the military like my father and grandparents but it didn’t work out. The job in home guards gave me satisfaction to some extent. My selfless service earned me awards from Trichy district collectors thrice in my 16 years of service,” said Belson. 
 
 After waiting for seven months without getting any reply from the officials and the government on his petition, he requested the district legal services authority to order the police department to reinstate him. On Saturday, he turned up for the lok adalat on the Trichy district court campus and met the principal district judge asking for forgiveness.
