LUCKNOW: Upset with the proposal to raise retirement age of doctors from 65 to 70 years, the executive committee members of   Faculty Forum met governor   on Tuesday. 

 The forum said that if doctors' retirement age is raised to 70 years, it will encourage arbitrary precedents and adhoc decision making that will destroy the autonomy and academic framework of the institute. 
 
 "The governor heard all our grievances and has assured us he will look into it," said forum secretary Dr MS Ansari.
 
 "The faculty members are extremely disappointed since the proposal was floated without seeking opinion of the general faculty. The manner in which four faculty members due to retire have lobbied for this proposal has been condemned by all," said Dr Ansari. 
 
 He added that the letter signed by the four and sent to the government and forwarded by two ministers, "was full of misinformation and misrepresentation. Vested interests are perhaps behind this". 
 
 Dr Ansari said, "The proposal seems to be contrary to the provisions of SGPGIMS Act. The Act provides for contractual re-employment and should not be needlessly changed for benefiting a few."
 
 The forum has agreed that while superannuation at 70 years is unacceptable, re-employment should be only on need basis.
