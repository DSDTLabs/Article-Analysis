LUCKNOW: Priyanka’s name has surfaced in the Congress’ staggered list of star campaigners for the first and second phases of polls, suggesting that she may throw in her weight behind at least a few   candidates who contest the polls in west UP. Recently she played a crucial role in kickstarting the alliance talks with Akhilesh in New Delhi. 

 Oddly, while   featured on the first set of joint posters released earlier last week, her photographs were dropped from the joint campaign material. Congress president  , who was conspicuous by her absence in the earlier set of posters, also made an entry into the new campaign material on Sunday.
