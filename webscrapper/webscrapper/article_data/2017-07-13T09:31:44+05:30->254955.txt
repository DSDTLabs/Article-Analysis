PUNE:   leaders in the   on Wednesday submitted a proposal to the standing   seeking waiving of property tax on small houses. 

 "The   should give discount on the lines offered by   (BMC). It will give a message to society that the civic body is safeguarding the rights of citizens," stated the proposal tabled before the standing committee by Sena corporator Bala Ostwal.
 
 The BMC recently passed a resolution waiving property tax on small homes. Accordingly, houses with a carpet area of up to 500 sq ft will not have to pay any tax, while owners of houses between 500 sq ft and 700 sq ft will get 60% concession in property tax. Sena leaders want the same system to be implemented in Pune.
 
 Property tax is one of the key sources of income for the PMC. The civic body collects property tax from nearly 8.3 lakh properties. The PMC had a property tax target of   1,600 crore for the financial year 2016-17, but the target was not met and it managed to collect around Rs 1,200 crore only. However, the target for 2017-18 has been set at Rs 1,333 crore.
 
 Standing committee chairman Murlidhar Mohol said, "The proposal is yet to be included in the agenda. After that, it will be tabled before the standing committee. Committee members will discuss the issue and take a call on it." 
 
 The proposal will be later sent to the municipal commissioner to analyze its financial implication and to find out how many residents stand to benefit if it is implemented in the city. The commissioner will then send the proposal back to the civic House for discussion. Once the House approves the commissioner's recommendations, it will be sent to the state government for its final approval.
