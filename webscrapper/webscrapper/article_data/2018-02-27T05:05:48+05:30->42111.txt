MUMBAI:   (32), who died in the   machine room at Nair Hospital, has demanded a   of Rs 86 lakh. The family demanded, through a legal notice to the hospital and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the compensation within 15 days.

 The Lalbaug resident, who was there to visit a relative, was sucked into the machine and died during treatment on January 26. An employee with a textile outlet in Parel, he was the primary bread-earner of the family. 
 
 “About the fortnight ago, the family approached us, saying that the civic official and hospital management have stopped responding to their queries. They tried meeting the commissioner but did not get a favourable response. It’s appalling that   is hiding behind the garb of conducting an investigation. It was an open-and-shut case, so what’s taking them so long?” said Susieben Shah of Stree Shakti Kendra, a state-affiliated family counselling centre. 
 
 “BMC must realize that the family has lost their main breadwinner due to its negligence. He used to earn Rs 1,200 a day. His father is a newspaper vendor. An internal investigation is not going to help the family. His mother is completely distraught,” she said. Shah said if BMC does not pay up, they will seek redressal from a consumer court. “It’s a shame that the country’s richest corporation cannot sympathize with the family’s plight,” she said. 
 
 Nair hospital   Dr Ramesh Bharmal said he was yet to see the notice.
