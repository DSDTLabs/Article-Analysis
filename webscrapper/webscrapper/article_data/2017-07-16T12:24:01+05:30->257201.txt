JAIPUR: For the family of four-year-old Meenakshi Kumari, who was living in the slums of Tilla Number 8 in Raja Park, the joy of getting her admission in a prestigious school in   came crashing down.

 Kumari was denied admission in Class I by the school on the ground that she has not studied in pre-primary class.
 
 The complaint has reached the   Act cell of state education department which is examining the case. This is not an isolated case as all district education officers have been receiving complaints by parents who are facing problems in RTE quota admissions.
 
 Pranjal Singh of Abhyutthanam Society has contended that schools are forcing parents to admit their wards on their own terms. “Kumari has been admitted in the Class I under RTE Act. Her no experience in any class below I cannot deter her from claiming the seat in Class I. This is illegal and unfortunate,” said Singh.
 
 His society has challenged the state government rule of allowing admissions to only   in the Supreme Court which directed the state to put an income cap for the admissions under RTE for the session 2017-18. Most of the complaints are regarding wrong information provided on the number of students admitted by them by the school.
 
 “I have checked how some posh schools in the city have created new entry level to reduce the number of admissions so that they can have few students under RTE quota of 25% seats,” said Singh.
 
 Saytendra Kumar, head of RTE cell confirmed that they are receiving complaints against the school. “These complaints are being examined by the DEO and most of them have been resolved at the local level. Those which require expertise are being handled by us,” said Kumar.
