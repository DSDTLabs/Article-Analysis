Udhagamandalam: The famous Government Botanical Garden, the crown of holiday retreat Ooty, is getting ready to welcome tourists for the second tourist season that starts from September.

 Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya inaugurated flower   at the garden on Friday. About 2.5 lakh plants of 70 different varieties will be planted at the garden spread across 22 hectares.
 
 “Seeds of 70 varieties of flowering plants have been sown in the garden. At least 2.5 lakh saplings are ready for planting. In the first phase, perennial flower saplings like salvia and delphinium will be planted,” a senior official of the horticulture department told TOI.
 
 The bloom is expected during the second week of September, which would last for another two months, the official said. About 6,500 flower pots of various shapes are also getting ready for display.
 
 “As the preparation period for the second tourists season happens to be rainy season, compared to the annual tourist season, the varieties of plants will be less,” said the official.
 
 Favoured by the hilly terrain and the weather conditions in the Nilgiris, species like French marigold, ageratum and aster are regular features in the garden. Out of the 70 varieties, nearly 50% are F1 hybrids selected for vibrant colours and attractive features. The saplings are planted according to their life span so as to keep the garden in full bloom during the second tourist season, the official said.
 
 Systematic introduction and maintenance of plants in the garden since its inception has resulted in the collection of over 2,000 species representing over 100 natural orders. At least three-lakh tourists are expected during the months of September and October.
