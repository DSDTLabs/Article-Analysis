NEW DELHI: Home minister  , while addressing the country’s top police officers at the IB’s annual DG/IG meet, said that terror infrastructure in Pakistan continues to exist and the western neighbour is leaving no stone unturned to incite J&K youth against India. 

 The senior   leader also asked the DGPs/commissioners of states/UTs and central agencies to make sure that incidents of communal violence like religious riots, desecration of religious places, smuggling or killing of cows are dealt with strictly, sources told TOI. 
 
 Singh added that terror infrastructure in the form of training camps, launch pads and communication control stations of terrorists continue to exist in Pakistan and PoK. 
 
 “The financing of separatists and infiltration of terrorists from across the border is an area of concern. The separatists take advantage of any law and order situation to instil anti-India sentiments among people,” Singh said.
