Pune: The Airports Authority of India has cautioned job-seekers against misleading advertisements offering jobs at airports. 

 A notice in this regard was issued by K Srinivasa Rao, general manager, human resources,  , on Sunday.
 
 Pune airport officials said the facility did not have any openings even as they received some calls seeking appointments.
 
 “All this is fraud and there are job rackets across the country trying to trap desperate job-seekers. As far as the Pune airport is concerned, there are no vacancies and people should be extremely careful when they come across such advertisements and think about applying,” an airport official told TOI.
 
 A statement released by the AAI said: “This is to inform that all the vacancies and recruitments in AAI are notified on AAI’s website, Employment News/Rojgar Samachar and leading newspapers. Link to apply for AAI vacancies is available only on AAI’s official website — www.aai.aero — and not on any other website. Only application fee is payable at the time of online registration and no other payments are sought at any stages of recruitment. By this notice it is brought to the knowledge of all prospective job aspirants to exercise caution and not to be misled by such false advertisements. The Airports Authority of India is not responsible in any way for any loss and/or damage caused by the action of unscrupulous elements.”
 
 Sources at Lohegaon airport said that last year in October, they had received several calls in connection with jobs which didn’t exist. “A complaint was also filed by some of the job aspirants with the local Vimannagar police station,” an official added.
 
 The official said that calling up the airport and checking the website was important for job-seekers. “The website of the AAI should be checked by them frequently and the above process, as explained in the notice, should be followed,” the official said.
