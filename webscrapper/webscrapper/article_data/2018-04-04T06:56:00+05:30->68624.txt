Greater Noida: A four-member proctorial board formed by   to probe the alleged assault on a Kenyan student handed over its report to the vice-chancellor on Tuesday.

The Kenyan student, who also holds Yemeni citizenship, was allegedly lifted by the hands and legs and thrown out of the university by some guards. The student had on Monday identified three of the guards, who are likely to be sacked.
 
 “The proctorial board has submitted the 22-page report to the vice-chancellor of the university. He will take a final call on the matter,” a source said.
 
 The student had on Monday said his parents had advised him to withdraw the complaint and concentrate on his studies and that he was thinking about it.
 
 A committee formed by the district magistrate has decided to look into the “broader aspect” of how international students and those from the other states, especially the Northeast, were treated in the university.
 
 “We have asked the university to present its side. The entire CCTV footage will be examined. It has been sought,” ADM Kumar Vineet, who is heading the inquiry along with SP (rural) Suniti, said.
 
 On Tuesday, the university management issued an advisory to all hostel wardens to report any “mischief or suspicious activity” on the premises to the security and registrar’s office. The advisory, which seeks a “strict vigil”, has been issued to the wardens of eight hostels, many of which house international students.
 
 The student had on Monday said the trouble had started when a woman friend abused one of the guards and he started laughing at it.
 
 “My friend had abused one of the guards and I started laughing. He got angry and started frisking me for a packet of cigarettes. This led to a confrontation, and they beat me up,” he had said.
