NEW DELHI: A bird taking to the skies is natural but not if it does so in an aircraft and that too in the front end of the passenger cabin! This   of fancy reportedly took place on an Ahmedabad-Mumbai flight last month.

 The bird hopped inside the aircraft at Ahmedabad airport and is learnt to have remained under a seat in the front cabin.
 
 However by the time this ticketless passenger was spotted, the aircraft’s nearest airport was Mumbai and so the crew decided to proceed to the destination. Once the   landed in Mumbai and the aircraft gate was opened, the bird flew out of the plane. 
 
 Sources said this unprecedented incident took place on August 21. A senior official of an airline on which sources claimed the bird flew said that the “same was never confirmed”.
