VADODARA: A car travelling on wrong side of the road may have led to fatal accident of a school boy on  , but it is not the only spot to witness blatant flouting of traffic rules. 

 Wrong side driving is rampant on majority of busy roads in the city. Commuters don’t just drive on the wrong side of the road but they even argue with those who try to advise them about traffic rules. 
 
 The police had begun closing down intersections on many roads to prevent accidents and reduce obstruction of traffic flow. 
 
 But commuters instead of taking long diversions, prefer to drive on the wrong side to reach their destination quickly. Even traffic cops, sometimes, seem helpless. On Tuesday, a woman with her son riding pillion, was seen commuting on two-wheeler on the wrong side of the road near   where the schoolboy was killed in an accident. When the cops stopped her, she made some excuse and drove off. 
 
 “It is not possible to post cops at every intersection to stop wrong side driving. The commuters too should understand their responsibility and follow traffic rules for their own and other’s safety,” said  , ACP (traffic).
