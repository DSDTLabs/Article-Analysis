Hyderabad: The   (UoH) is nearing completion of the India-European Union project-E-QUAL (Enhancing Quality, Access and Governance of Undergraduate Education in India) and is now going to collaborate with several universities within the country and abroad to help develop e-learning materials for different disciplines.

 The E-QUAL project is a European Union-funded collaborative project with a funding commitment of over one million Euros till May 2017. The project activities are being implemented in disciplines like critical thinking, cultural studies, human ecology, natural resource management and sustainable development. The idea is to provide greater access and improve quality of education in India.
 
 “While the aim of e-learning is to implement e-courses and provide training for teachers on developing e-content, UoH became the first central university to develop and adopt an online education policy. An e-learning centre was set up as per the policy,” said Prof J Prabhakar Rao, faculty coordinator for the project.
 
 “The project has also helped expose students to organising academic conference and presenting papers on online education. The study modules expose them to diverse disciplinary perspectives and basic concepts for a holistic understanding on the subject,” added Rao.
