 Mumbai:  , the country’s largest stock exchange by market capitalisation, was hit by a   about extension of   hours since Friday morning. By evening the exchange was forced to issue a clarification saying it had no such plans, that it had not issued any such circular and the circular that did the rounds through the day was a fake one.
 
 Since Friday morning, a circular purportedly from the exchange was doing the rounds in the market which said that from October 31, there will be an additional post-closing session on NSE, from 5.10pm to 5.30pm every day. A post closing session is a time period after close of regular market at 3.30pm during which brokers are allowed to close out their open positions, but they are not allowed to enter any new trade. 
 
 The circular, complete with circular reference number and other unique identifiers, also mentioned about a communication from Sebi to the bourses about trading hours. Market participants interpreted this move as a precursor to extending the regular trading hours to 5pm from 3.30pm now. earlier this month, several media reports had said that Sebi and the bourses were weighing in the option to extend the regular trading hours for the   up to 7pm, so that Indian investors are aligned with the markets in Europe and the US. 
 
 Through a release in the evening, NSE said that it had not issued any circular “for revision of the market timings for closing session. It is noticed that a forged circular is being circulated, using the name and logo of the exchange, bearing download ref no: NSE/CMTR/36012 and circular ref no: 305/2017, dated September 21, 2017 stating that the market timings for closing session have been revised by the exchange.” NSE requested all broker, investors and other stakeholders “to verify the source, content and authenticity of such circulars,” on the exchange’s official website.
