Chandigarh: For sustaining itself, Panjab University will have to generate an additional income of Rs 35 crore from the next academic session for which the newly-constituted think tank of the university suggested various ways in its first meeting on Tuesday. A 12% increase in the income from the 2018-19 session onwards will be required for its smooth financial sailing, according to sources, who said that this was discussed in the meeting. 

 An interesting suggestion to generate more income given by a think tank member was to hold skill-development classes during weekend by faculty members of the PU since its space could be used during weekends. The members agreed on this and a proposal allowing certain faculty members to hold the classes will be tabled in a syndicate meeting for approval, the sources said. Another suggestion to cut down the expenditure was the consolidation of departments that have single or two faculty members and several non-teaching staff. The sources said that this suggestion was unanimously agreed upon. The consolidation of department would be beneficial for the choice-based credit system (CBSCS) in the university. 
 
 Another suggestion was increasing the student intake by 10% as a means to generate additional income. However, some members put forward the argument that there were certain regulatory bodies for different courses, which won’t allow this. Increasing seats would result in additional income of around 8%, members discussed. Moreover, an increase in fee, including that for hostels, not more than 10% annually, was also discussed. However, the members suggested that some other possibilities should also be explored. 
 
 It was discussed in the meeting that the 2017-18 session won’t be a problem to manage financially but planning needs to be done for the 2018-19 session from now. Since the centre funding will increase by Rs 12 crore, keeping their promise of 6% increase every year, and the Punjab government will also add around Rs 2 crore in the next session, the university will have to increase its income by 12% for 2018-19 session. It was discussed in the meeting that last year, the university had generated an additional Rs 66 crore as compared to the last two years. This amount covered the previous years’ deficit and the additional income generated this year will cover the additional expenses. It was discussed that the university needed to plan for the 2018-19 session to sustain for long. An audit of courses was also suggested by members to identify the course that are not adding value. 
 
 Moreover, it was decided that a sub-committee will be formed, which will include members from UIAMS, UIHTM and UBS to see that the space in the university was utilized properly. Another suggestion was to create an endowment fund, like the one in the chemistry department. It should be maintained so that the funds do not get depleted and a part of it should be reserved for research component. Sources said that another suggestion for a huge lecture hall complex with all audio-visual facility to accommodate more students was also made. 
 
 Another committee will be formed to look into the condition of the smaller houses on the campus, which were in bad shape and beyond repair. It should ensure that the houses don’t collapse. Sources said that all these suggestion were made so that the campus looks attractive to woo more students.
