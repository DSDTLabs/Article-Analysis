Amritsar/Jalandhar: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) have joined hands to launch a joint agitation for the reconstruction of Gurdwara Gyan Godri in Haridwar, Uttarakhand.

 DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK said he met SGPC chief Kirpal Singh Badungar in New Delhi on Wednesday, following which they issued a joint appeal to Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh to prepare a draft for a series of global religious programmes for reclaiming the land of the shrine at Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar.
 
 In 1979, the then Uttar Pradesh (UP) government (Uttarakhand was carved out in 2000) had acquired land where the gurdwara was situated for the beautification of Har Ki Pauri. The land was not returned to Sikhs despite government offering to give alternate places to the evacuees, the DSGMC and SGPC have claimed. Later, the government allotted an alternate place for the gurdwara, but the land was disputed between governments of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
 
 G K said SGPC and DSGMC would initiate a dialogue with the UP and Uttrakhand governments for the purpose. “We will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev at Gurdwara Gyan Godri in 2019,” said GK, adding that they would be using social media to create awareness about the significance of the shrine.
 
 He said a joint delegation of SGPC and DSGMC would meet Prime Minster Narendra Modi, UP chief minister Yogi Aditiyanath and Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat.
