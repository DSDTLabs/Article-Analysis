PATNA: The legislature party meeting of   will be held on July 16, a day before the presidential election.

 NDA’s presidential candidate   has so far not visited the state to solicit votes from the MLAs of supporting parties. “Till now, we have no information about Kovind’s visit,” said state BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel. He said at the legislature party meeting on July 16, party’s senior functionaries would tell MLAs about the way votes are cast in a presidential election.
 
 The 17-party opposition has fielded  , former   and daughter of former deputy PM Jagjiwan Ram, to take on Kovind and make possible breach among the MLAs of the parties which have declared to support to him. 
 
 Given the fluid political situation in Bihar, there are muffled discussions in political circles about the likelihood of possible cross voting by the MLAs. The BJP has been assailing deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, seeking his resignation or dismissal in the backdrop of registration of an FIR by the CBI against him.
 
 As CM   has announced, the JD (U) MLAs will vote for Kovind for his individual qualities and personal performance as Bihar governor. That brings the support 129 MLAs – 58 of the NDA and 71 of the JD (U) – for Kovind. Meira Kumar is expected to get the support of 110 MLAs – 80 of the RJD, 27 of the Congress and three of the CPI(ML). The support of four Independent MLAs is uncertain and could be decided in the next couple of days.
 
 In terms of vote count (the vote value of one MLA in Bihar is 173), Kovind and Meira are expected to get 22,317 and 19,030 votes, respectively. The value of the votes of four Independent MLAs is 692.
