VADODARA: Did the   (VMC) bypass state government’s orders to give aid for medical expenses to a former councillor and the son of another former corporator? That seems to be the case if a recent proposal put before the standing committee is to be believed.

 The VMC had a tradition of giving such aid for treatment of serious ailments like cardiac problems, cancer or kidney transplant. In 2003, the civic body had passed a resolution to give such aid within a limit of Rs five lakh every year to current and former corporators. But the matter was referred to the state government by a VMC commissioner subsequently.
 
 The state government had in 2005 set aside the resolution by the VMC general board to give such aid. Despite this, the VMC had made provisions in its 2013-14 revised budget and the draft budget for the year 2014-15 for such aid.
 
 In 2014, the VMC even gave medical aid totalling to Rs 3.6lakh to former councillor   and the son of former councillor Gulam Sheikh. The standing committee had passed a resolution in this regard after the administration termed them as special cases.
 
 Last year, two former councillors – Chirag Sheikh from   and   from BJP – had applied for aid for treatment of heart ailments. Sheikh had sought Rs 1.7lakh while Yadav had sought Rs 1.8lakh.
 
 But the proposal put up by the VMC administration before the standing committee this time clearly mentions the state government’s directives in 2005 in this regard. The standing committee did not take a call on the proposal and forwarded it to the general board.
 
 Dr Jigisha Sheth, VMC’s standing committee chairperson said, “We will examine the proposal in detail. The documents of the resolutions that were set aside by the state government and other details also need to be studied. The administration is seeking clarity on whether we can do this and also if this can be continued?”
