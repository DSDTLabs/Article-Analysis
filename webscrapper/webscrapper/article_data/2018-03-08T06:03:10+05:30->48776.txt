KOLKATA: A woman priest solemnizing biye without kanyadaan is not a common sight. Days before International Women’s Day, TOI was witness to the quiet revolution against patriarchy at a private resort in  .

 “I want to do away with the patriarchal mindset where parents appear to be renouncing the custody of their kanya, treating her like a commodity and giving her away as daan(donation),” says  , presiding priest for the unusual wedding of 27-year-olds —   and Arka Bhattacharya on February 24.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Come Saturday, the Sanskrit teacher at JU and her team — collegemate and fellow priest   and vocalists Semanti Banerjee and   — will officiate a similar wedding, with the bride’s parents shunning the ritual of sampradaan. The trend seems to be slowly catching up among today’s youth, who approach   through social media.
 
 Arka feels women are not only breaking into a male bastion, but are also adding value to priesthood. “I have heard so many male priests reciting the mantras wrong. At a friend’s wedding officiated by Nandini and her friends last year, I was instantly drawn to the way the Sanskrit lines were vividly explained in English and Bengali,” he said.
 
 The practice is actually thousands of years old. The earliest Hindu texts, especially Rig Veda, speak of women priests and there was no kanyadaan. Thus, Nandini calls herself a “change agent”, in her endeavour to take the society back to that system.
 
 Refuting that female priests are a violation of Vedic law, Sanskrit scholar and   said, “There is nothing in Hindu scriptures that bars women from becoming priests. In fact, there were multiple references to women priests, participating in spiritual and philosophical debates in the Vedas.”
