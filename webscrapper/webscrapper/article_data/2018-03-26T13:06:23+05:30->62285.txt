PILIBHIT: Conservator of forest, Bareilly circle,   has announced the schedule for a fresh tour of PTR’s field forest personnel to the   (CTR) to carry out study on wildlife management between March 27 and 29 after obtaining permission from principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), UP, S K Upadhyay.
 
  The PTR team will stay at the forest guest house in   during the course of their study at CTR.
  
  Prior to this, a 20-member study team, comprising mainly PTR clerks, had gone to CTR, but CTR field director   was reportedly not informed about the tour in writing.
  
  The team stayed at a private resort in Ramnagar, the approval for which was purportedly not sought by the DFO from PCCF through the conservator. In such a situation, the tour was deemed by the forest administration as “fake”.
  
  The conservator told TOI, “At CTR, the field director will train the PTR team on scientific methods of wildlife and grassland management, techniques of mitigating man-animal conflicts, drinking water arrangement for wildlife, advanced methods of surveillance, conservation of tigers and ways to promote eco-tourism.”
  
  He added that the team would include two each range and deputy range officers, eight forest inspectors, seven forest guards and one field staff.
