MARGAO: A group of   have strongly opposed   to field former   chairperson and present   from Curtorim.

 Protesting under the banner ‘Curtorim Constituency’, about 20 locals said the saffron party should replace D’Silva with a local face as the 26,000-odd residents of Curtorim deserve to have a representative who is not an outsider and familiar with issues affecting the villagers.
 
 One of the protesters said these candidates don’t do any work but sprout like mushrooms only during the election seasons. tnn
