CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday issued a notice to the   on a plea challenging the state’s  .

 The matter reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by the   of Rohtak and several others. Petitioners have sought directions to quash the February 2017 scheme drafted by the Haryana government for being contrary to the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and also against the rules framed by the state government itself called as   Vehicles Rules, 1993.
 
 According to the petitioner, the state government had framed the policy in 1993 giving permits to the private operators and accordingly permits were granted to the petitioners which were renewed from time to time. The scheme published on February 17, is completely vague, as it does not provide the ratio of the routes to be operated by the state transport undertakings and private operators.
 
 “No procedure is prescribed for the grant of permit and no publication is circulated in the newspaper informing every corner for the availability of the permits and procedure to be adopted in grant of those permits and even the interest of the existing operators have not been taken care who are operating their permits since 1993. The entire exercise has been made to favour the mighty people on the basis of pick and choose policy,” petitioners contended.
