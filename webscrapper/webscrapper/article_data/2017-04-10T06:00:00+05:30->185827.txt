 may be a dozen films old in Tollywood. yet, confessedly, it’s only in her upcoming film ' ', that she’s getting to do a “plot-centric” role. “So far, I have done roles which were all very nice and strong. but if you look closely, you’ll see they weren’t very plot-centric. I was always stuck playing characters that were just part of the ‘sub plot’; the real story revolved around the hero,” says Rakul. 
So, how is this role different? “Oh! It’s fantastic! The best part is, my character is as important as Naga Chaitanya’s. you can say, they both go hand in hand,” she shares, adding, “I play a village girl who is the darling of her family. She’s loveable, simple yet stubborn. It’s such a fantastically written character that when I am playing her on the sets, I often say, ‘God, the shooting for this film should never end’. She’s someone like Kareena Kapoor’s Geet from  . I’m sure she’ll make people fall in love with her simplicity.”
 Admittedly, this is also her “first love story”. “All my movies have obviously had a love track; but they were incidental to the plot. but this one is all about the love between Chai and me; everything else is incidental. So in that sense, this is the first time I am doing a proper love story,” says Rakul.
 If the recently released poster of the film is anything to go by, then it looks like Rakul will be seen channelling some serious village belle charm. “Tell me about it! I’ll be seen rocking everything from half sarees, pattu langas and churidaars, to glass bangles, mallepoolu and gold jewellry. My stylist has sourced all the dress materials from Jaipur, so there’ll be lot of block prints with bright colour combinations. every outfit is custom-made; nothing is off the rack,” says Rakul, who’s set to wrap up shooting for the   directorial in the next two weeks.
