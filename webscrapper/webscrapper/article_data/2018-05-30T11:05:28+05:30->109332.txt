CHENNAI: The Pallikarnai marshland finally getting due recognition with forest minister C   announcing its restoration on Monday.

 
 The eco-restoration will include habitat improvement, protection, research,  ,   which will be taken up over a period of five years from the current financial year.
 
 In the past 50 years, nearly 90% of the marsh has been lost. Large tracts of the marshland have been converted into residential areas, especially in Thoraipakkam,   and Perungudi. 
 
 Not only have roads and landfills fragmented the marsh into smaller portions, but also invasive species of plants like Prosopis juliflora and water hyacinth have taken over large areas of the marshland. 
 
  Following the declaration of a part of the marsh, spread over 690.85 hectares, as a protected area, the unprotected area has been converted rather rapidly into human occupied zones. 
 
 Other important announcements by the forest minister include setting up of a beehive fence along 10 villages in Coimbatore forest divisions. These fences will drive the elephants away from human habitation. 
 
 An elite force will be set up in the forest department to attend to exigencies such as forest fires, encroachments, human animal conflict. The forces will be formed in two places in the state.
