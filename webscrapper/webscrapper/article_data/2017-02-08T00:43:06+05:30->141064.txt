Chennai: The water scarcity in the southern suburbs is turning grave with residents of Chromepet, Pallavaram and Zamin Pallavaram getting   water only once a week and that too for just an hour. Faced with the double whammy of monsoon failure and civic apathy, residents are now forced to buy water from tankers.

 Long time Chromepet resident and social activist V Santhanam said, “The   scenario is alarming in the suburbs. Earlier, we used to get 55 lakh litres per day, which was supplemented by Metrowater chipping in with 10 lakh litres, but now it has fallen to 40 lakh litres.” 
 
 Cyclone Vardah had improved the water level for a few days but now the wells had dried up, Santhanam said. Residents are shelling out Rs. 2,500 per tanker containing 12,000 litres of water. The tanker water is sourced from wells in agricultural lands in the surrounding areas.
 
 M Jacob, a resident of Chitlapakkam, said many of the water bodies in the suburbs have not been rejuvenated. “The government had sanctioned Rs.22 crore for the rejuvenation of Keelkatalai and Pallavaram lakes but the tussle between the Pallavaram municipality and the public works department has put back the project by two years,” he said.
 
 Though civic associations in the suburbs have done their best to protect the water bodies, the civic bodies have failed to help them in this regard. Residents said if the lakes had been cleaned and protected from encroachment, it could have augmented water supplies in the suburbs.
