LUCKNOW: Furious at a question in the   of the   exams, which asked students to write a letter describing the “laxity” of primary school teachers in performing their duties, primary teachers of the state have decided to wear black arm bands in protest, with at least one district unit calling for a boycott of exam invigilation duties.

 A question, for five marks, for the exam on February 21 asked students to write a letter to the district magistrate about the laxity of primary teachers in performing their duties. Demanding immediate action against authorities who framed the question,   president   said, “This is a deliberate move to defame primary teachers. It raises questions about the paper setter’s mentality.” The Bareilly unit of UP Junior High School Teachers’ Association on Saturday asked teachers performing duties of invigilators in UP board exams to boycott it from Monday onwards. Of the total 1,900 teachers of basic education department performing duties in UP boards in Bareilly, over 600 are of junior high schools.
