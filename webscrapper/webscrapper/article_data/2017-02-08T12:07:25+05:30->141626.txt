MEEERUT: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) workers clashed with police on Tuesday after the latter removed BSP posters and banners from areas outside the party’s office in  . Agitating workers also damaged a police vehicle, forcing cops to resort to lathicharge to bring the situation under control. A few BSP cadres were also reportedly injured in the incident.
 
  According to sources, circle officer Tejvir Singh, along with a team of officials, arrived at the Muzaffarnagar bus stand, located opposite the BSP office, and began removing the posters from nearby buildings in the area. Seeing this, some BSP workers soon entered into an argument with the policemen. Additional district magistrate Manoj Singh also reached the spot to take stock of the situation. Reports also stated that the clash was triggered after a woman worker was hit by a policeman.
