HYDERABAD: The MLAs of Telangana on Tuesday received an assurance on an issue that has become a matter of some vital importance in the state, at least for some politicians. When the legislators move finally into their office-cum-residences now being built in all Assembly constituency headquarters, they can sleep in the residential quarters with peace. 

 The buildings are fully Vaastu compliant, as per Roads & Buildings Minister  . The government plans to build 104 of such buildings with the first of them already inaugurated in   constituency. The 15 MLAs from the city will get accommodations for office-cum-residence in the soon to be inaugurated new buildings at the New MLA Quarters.
 
 It may be recalled that chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao is a staunch believer in Vaastu and one of the primary reasons for the plan to demolish the existing   complex and build anew one is because of his belief that the Secretariat is not as per Vaastu. Even Pragati Bhavan, the chief minster's official residence-cum-office complex is believed to be in adherence with the strictest of Vaastu principles. The chief minister also has a personal advisor on matters of Vaastu, Suddala Sudhakar Teja who was appointed in 2015 as an advisor to the government on architecture. The initial appointment of one year was extended by another three in February 2016. TNN
