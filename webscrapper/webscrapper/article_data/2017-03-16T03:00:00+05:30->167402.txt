Calangute: The village panchayats of Candolim and Arpora-Nagoa, both in Calangute constituency, will be holding gram sabhas on Sunday, March 19, to discuss the budgetary proposals of 2017-18. Although the Bardez block development office had directed all panchayats to hold gram sabhas before the end of February, some panchayats had decided to wait for the election results to be declared and the code of conduct to end. Only the Calangute panchayat had held a gram sabha on the last Sunday of February.

 “People tend to raise a number of issues and then get angry if there is no discussion or we don’t agree to come up with a resolution. This is why we avoided holding the gram sabha while the election code of conduct was there as it would have been impossible to discuss only the budget,” a Candolim panchayat member said.
 
 After the February gram sabha on budget, the Calangute panchayat had held another gram sabha last Sunday to discuss the proposal related to declaring the arterial Candolim-Calangute-Arpora major district road as a highway. The gram sabha members had adopted a resolution to oppose the conversion of the road.
