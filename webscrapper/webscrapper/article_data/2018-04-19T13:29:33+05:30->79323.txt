MADURAI: A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the   bench of the Madras high court seeking to initiate criminal proceedings against the chairmen and managing directors of the state-run transport corporations by stating that they operate ordinary service buses as express service and collect excess fare. 

 Karur-based advocate M Rajendran filed the PIL. When it came up for hearing before the bench of justices C T   and A M  , the bench directed the petitioner to file necessary documents supporting the case and adjourned the hearing. 
 
 According to the petitioner, the state government operates 22,509 buses through Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporations of Kumbakonam, Villupuram, Madurai, Salem, Coimbatore and Tirunelveli. The corporation has classified those buses as mofussil, city (MTC), ordinary, express, deluxe, by-pass-non-stop, ultra delux, air-conditioned and Volvo. The government revised the   in January last. However, it did not follow mandatory procedure mentioned in the Tamil Nadu Motor Service Rules. As per rules, the transport corporations should disclose the mandatory particulars including bus fare and time schedule and contain first aid things. Besides, the corporations just affix sticker of express service on the buses for ordinary service and operate them. 
 
 For ordinary bus service, Rs 16 is the fare from Trichy to Tollgate. But, Rs 24 is being collected by stating that it is an express service. It is nothing but cheating the commuters. The chairman and managing directors are responsible for this illegal action.
