 ( )): Neither the crack-of-dawn flag-off nor the long drive to the outskirts deterred hundreds of Bengalureans from turning up at the inaugural   held at Nandi Hills on Sunday. 

  Marathons, cyclathons, heritage walks, yoga sessions, games in the children's zone, farmers' market and food trucks gave a carnivalesque touch to the habba, a celebration of Nandi Hills, home to one of South Asia's few cloud forests. Touted to be an annual event, it was organized by the tourism department, United Way Bengaluru and Namma Nimma Cycle. 
 
  "Over 1,200 people registered for the event. We had 10km and 21km runs, as well as amateur and elite cyclathons. While we provided buses for participants from Kanteerava Stadium, many came on their own. It was great to see people on the spot at 5am to register for the cyclathon," said Manish Michael, CEO, United Way Bengaluru. 
 
  The habba is part of   project, which aims to preserve heritage and ecology, and improve solid waste management. 
 
  It will include assigning heritage tags to monuments, mapping heritage trails for walking and cycling, creating an environment for migratory birds and planting native plant species. "It's great that we have a place like Nandi Hills so close to the state capital, yet far enough to remain relatively untouched," said Rajendra S, a participant. 
 
  "An event of this nature had been in the pipeline for years. The heritage of Nandi Hills needs to be celebrated," said Veerappa Moily, senior Congress leader and Chikkaballapura MP. 
 
  
 
 
  Chikkaballapura residents alleged the event was not publicised well in their district. They said all the participants were from Bengaluru and that many of the banners and posters had information only in English and not Kannada. They said lack of publicity was the reason for low farmer turnout.
