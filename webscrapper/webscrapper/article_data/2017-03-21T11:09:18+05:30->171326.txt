NAGPUR: The   (DTE) would be conducting its last   for admissions into bachelor of engineering and pharmacy courses on   11. This time, the Mumbai-based body has made some changes in the examination and admissions process.

 “We’ve reduced the centralized admissions process (CAP) into three rounds from four. Though the entire schedule would be announced after the exam, but most probably fourth counselling round would be dropped,” joint director of technical education Gulab Thakre told TOI.
 
 He added that usually in MHT-CET, first paper is of physics and chemistry, but this year Mathematics paper would be conducted first. “From next year the MHRD granted permission to conduct one single entrance exam like JEE for admission to all engineering courses across the country on the lines of NEET. So, this would be last MHT-CET.”
 
 He clarified that from last year the admissions to engineering and pharmacy courses were made mandatory through MHT-CET only, so students must appear in it. “The filling up for online registration forms and their confirmation would continue till March 23. The students can still apply till March 31 with late fees. So far 2,59.895 students have applied for it and we’re hoping to cross 3 lakh mark.”
 
 Proffesor KL Meshram and ND Ghawghawe, both from government Polytechnic who would be assisting Thakre in conducting MHT-CET informed that there would be 120 centres in six districts for the exam.
 
 Thakre earlier informed that the charge of technical education director was given to Chandrashekhar Oak, who is chairman of State CEt Cell, after Subhash Mahajan was transferred to other department.
