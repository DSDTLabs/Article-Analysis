Mangaluru: The protest by private hospitals and doctors opposing National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill on Tuesday has had a little impact in Manglauru city as most of the private hospitals functioning as usual. However, the District Wenlock Hospital, the only government hospital in the city, witnessed a rush of patients than the usual.

 Mangaluru unit of the IMA too had called for a 12-hour closure of all services to oppose the NMC Bill. However, no major instances of patients suffering due to non availability of medical services are reported in the city. But, the outpatient department of District Wenlock Hospital, which normally receives an average of 1,000 patients a day, witnessed an extra rush with the number of patients crossing 1,400 by 6pm. The hospital, which has an MoU with Kasturba Medical College, provided services with all its units functioning normally. The hospital’s outpatient department was found crowded during the morning hours.
 
 Dr H R Rajeshwari Devi, medical superintendent of District Wenlock Hospital, told TOI that the hospital functioned efficiently. “The hospital witnessed an extra rush in the outpatient department, but our doctors and staff managed to provide treatment to all the patients,” she added.
 
 IMA coastal divisional coordinator Dr Annayya Kulal told TOI that outpatient departments in most of the private hospitals remained closed till evening. “All clinics run by the members of the IMA remained closed in the city. However, most of the hospitals in the tertiary sector did provide treatment to the patients. The protest has been withdrawn at the national-level following a positive assurance by the government. Following this, most of the private clinics resumed service by evening. We had announced the decision to shut down services only on Monday and hence we could not organise it in a big way. About 40-50% of doctors responded since it was a last minute decision,” he added.
