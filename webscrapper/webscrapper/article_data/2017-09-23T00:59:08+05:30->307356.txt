Salem: A 51-year-old sanitary inspector was arrested for duping a primary health centre nurse of Rs 80 lakh near Mettur here on Thursday late night. The arrested was identified as P Venkatachalam, of Kolathur in Mettur taluk.

 A sanitary inspector with the government primary health centre in Moolakkadai near Kolathur, Venkatachalam developed a relationship with R Poonkodi, 46, a nurse with the same primary health centre. “She had separated from her husband four years ago and her only son Gowrishankar was killed in a road accident in 2014,” a district crime branch (DCB) official said.
 
 According to the police, Venkatachalam borrowed money from Poonkodi on several occasions with a promise to return the amount at the earliest.
 
 “He borrowed Rs 80 lakh from Poonkodi over the past two years. At one stage, he assured Poonkodi to transfer his land or house to her name instead of returning the money,” the police added.
 
 Venkatachalam, however, refused to repay her and also transfer his land or house to Poonkodi’s name. He, along with his wife Yasodha, 44, also threatened to kill her if she were to lodge a police complaint.
 
 Poonkodi approached the Salem SP, P Rajan, who directed her to district crime branch. The crime branch officials registered a case against Venkatachalam and picked him up for questioning. During the interrogation, Venkatachalam confessed to the crime and he was subsequently arrested.
 
 The police produced Venkatachalam before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody for 15 days. Later, he was lodged at the Salem Central Prison.
 
 The police have launched a manhunt for Yasodha for threatening Poonkodi.
