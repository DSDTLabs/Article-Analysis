AMBALA: A special court of judicial magistrate first class on Friday denied a 19-year-old girl’s petition to abort her 28-week-old foetus. 

 The court had given its decision over an appeal filed by the girl on Thursday, who urged the court to abort her foetus as she was unmarried and would not be able to take care of the child.
 
 The girl belongs to a poor Ambala-based family and was working in Chandigarh where she had developed physical relations with a married man.

 The court immediately conducted a medical board of doctors and asked it to submit a report within 24 hours. The medical board comprising three female doctors – two gynaecologists and a female medical officer – on Friday submitted its report to the court. 
 
 The board said abortion could not be done because the foetus had turned 28 weeks old and was alive and that there was a risk to the life of mother as well.
 
 Observing the suggestions, the court denied the abortion and asked the girl to feel free to knock the door of high court for which legal services would also be provided free of cost to her.
 
 “We have submitted the report that there is a danger to the life of the mother. Moreover, as per legal terms, we cannot abort the foetus that had crossed 24 weeks of time. After 24 weeks a foetus is alive,” said chief medical officer Dr  .
 
 The counsel to the girl said, “She has decided not to move the high court and give birth to the child. However, she wants to hand over the child to any childless couple.”
