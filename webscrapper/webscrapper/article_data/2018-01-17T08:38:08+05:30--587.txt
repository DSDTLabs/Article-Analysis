CHANDIGARH: The electricity distribution companies (discoms) in Haryana have withdrawn the 10 paise per unit rebate for women subscribers having power connections in their name. According to information, a circular related to this was issued in December 2017.

 In the circulars, the chairman-cum-managing director of discoms—Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited (UHBVNL) and   (DHBVNL)—had asked the officials to ensure compliance of orders from the January 2018 billing cycle.
 
 “What else can you expect from them? Thankfully, they have not slapped a cess for the non-government business. Anything is possible here now,” former Haryana chief minister   said about the decision to withdraw rebate for women consumers.
 
 Haryana unit chief of the   (AAP) Navin Jaihind also flayed the government for withdrawing the scheme.
