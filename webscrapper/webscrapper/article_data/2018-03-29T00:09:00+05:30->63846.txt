Pune: Principal secretary (IT) SVR Srinivas on Wednesday said the state will decide to re-introduce private operators on government office premises to improve Aadhaar coverage across Maharashtra. “Currently, the coverage for Aadhaar in Maharashtra is 95%. We are planning to increase the number of kits from Mahaonline and will soon take a decision on allowing the private operators function from government office premises also,” he told TOI.  Earlier, services of the private operators were discontinued following complaints of large-scale malpractices. If the government ensures necessary necessary checks before re-introducing the private operators, the number of Aadhaar machines will increase in every district. Srinivas said he was having regular interactions with all district authorities to find out the number of machines in operation and the requirement.  “We have demand for private operators from most districts and the issue will be soon resolved,” he said.  In Pune district, the administration had sough 100 more machines to start enrollment for various sectors in camp mode.  “In Pune, 270 machines are operational — 134 in the city, 66 in the PCMC areas and 70 kits in the rural areas. We need 100 more machines for doorstep service meant for senior citizens or people with different ability,” an official in the district administration said.  Following the extension for Aadhaar linking various government welfare schemes, all departments implementing the programmes will have to complete the process by June.
