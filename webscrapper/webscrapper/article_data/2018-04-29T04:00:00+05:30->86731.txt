Vadodara: Eleven days after their suicide bid, Heena Thakkar, wife of civil contractor Alpesh Thakkar who died, gave her statement to Vadodara rural police. Heena, who was saved during the treatment at a private hospital, told the police that she and her husband had decided to end their lives as they were under a lot of pressure from moneylenders even as builders owed crores of rupees to Alpesh. While Alpesh had named several builders in his last message on WhatsApp group titled ‘Alvida’, Heena told the cops that she only knew that a builder named Ramesh Patel owed him Rs5 crore. “She does not know how much money other builders owed her husband. But from her statement it seems that more than the due, it was the pressure from the lenders that drove the couple to commit suicide,” said a police official. Police said a moneylender identified as Dilipsinh from Sherkhi used to keep asking for money. “She told us that many times, men of Dilipsinh used to come to the couple’s house to demand money. Dilipsinh had also threatened Alpesh that he will have to face consequences if the money was not returned,” the official said. The police are investigating the incident as a case of accidental death. However, the cops are expected to take statements of the builders in the coming days and may even register a case of extortion against the moneylenders. The couple had committed suicide by consuming poison on Bhimpura-Samlaya Road near the city on April 16 before creating a WhatsApp group. Alpesh had added all the builders for whom he had worked in the group and left a final message in which he wrote that many of them owed crores of rupees to him and since the money was not being returned, he is ending his life.
