PATNA: A probationary officer of prison department committed suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan inside his rented accommodation at   under Town police station in   on Sunday. The victim has been identified as Kundan Kumar (32).

 Principal probationary officer, Vaishali, Poonam Rani said Kumar, a 2013 batch officer, was looking for accommodation in Vaishali and temporarily staying in a room of prison department’s peon Mohammad Ali Raza. It was in the same room where Kumar was found hanging on Sunday.
 
 “Raza had talked to Kumar in the morning and asked him to get fresh before leaving for market. Later, Raza’s son found him hanging from a ceiling fan and informed his father,” Rani, who rushed to the spot from Patna, said.
 
 She said Kumar, who joined the prison department in Vaishali on October 4 last year, often looked depressed. His family members have reached Hajipur from Muzaffarpur and Bihta in Patna.
 
 SHO of Town police station Sunil Kumar said they have recovered a Jamshedpur doctor’s prescription, which proves that Kumar was undergoing treatment for depression. “We have so far not received any written complaint from Kumar’s family members,” the SHO added.
