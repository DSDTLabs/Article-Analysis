MIDNAPORE: The tiger, that has been on the prowl in different forests in Lalgarh, Goaltore, Salboni, Chandra and Dherua in   since the end of January causing the villagers and forest staffers to spend sleepless nights, was sighted in Dherua's   forest on Wednesday morning. 

 Three members of the Baghora forest protection committee team, who were in the forest, heard the tiger roar and come out from inside a pipeline beside a canal. The trio first hid behind trees and then tried to flee. Just then, they were relieved to see the tiger walk in the opposite direction towards Lakhanpur forest in Salboni.
 
 The trio informed the forest beat office in Chandra which conveyed the same to the Chandra range office and the Midnapore divisional forest office. Forest officials and staffers collected the pug marks from the spot.
 
 Hasan Hansda, one of the three who saw the tiger, said, "We were patrolling the forest to check on felling of trees when we spotted the tiger."
 
 Haren Mahato, in-charge of forest protection committee teams in the zone, said, "I spotted some tiger fur beside a culvert to cross the canal. The tiger apparently came out of the large pipe on hearing voices of the forest protection committee members."
 
 Midnapore divisional forest officer Rabindranath Saha said, "I heard the tiger was sighted. A team has been sent to the Chandra forest. We are assessing the situation."
