MARGAO: A geographic information system (GIS) survey of all commercial establishments in   Municipal Council’s ( ) ward 14, shows that the civic body has been losing a whopping Rs 3.5 crore in   from a single ward because such establishments had managed to evade tax. The agency that had conducted the survey on a pilot basis, placed its report before the council during a meeting on Wednesday.

 The purpose of the survey was to interpolate the GIS data obtained within GPS mapping, thereby determining the exact location of a unit. If extended to other wards, which officials said was likely, it would enable the MMC to identify establishments that are in operation without obtaining the requisite trade licences or paying the stipulated taxes. 
 
 The council on Wednesday also decided to extend the contract of the sopo (vendor fee) collector by a month. The current contract ends on March 31. The process of tendering sopo collection for the 2018-19 fiscal is likely to be completed within a month. 
 
 The issue had assumed significance in view of criticism the MMC had attracted over the delay in execution of the new contract. 
 
 The   had termed the delay a “deliberate attempt to favour the sopo contractor”, even as it had threatened to file complaint of criminal negligence for the financial losses caused to the civic body.
