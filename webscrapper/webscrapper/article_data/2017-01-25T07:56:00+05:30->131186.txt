Jalandhar:   and Congress questioned AAP about its performance in Delhi and the gap between what it promised and delivered. They said AAP was creating a “false perception” in Punjab, too, through a “misinformation campaign”.

 The parties organized separate press conferences. BJP Punjab affairs in charge Prabhat Jha listed the promises made by AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal and what he delivered, and challenged to counter these “facts”. “In AAP manifesto, Kejriwal had pledged regularization of all unauthorized colonies and handing over ownership certificates to everyone within a year. Now it’s been two years. I ask him to show us a single person who has been handed over the ownership. The AAP chief assured job skilling of 1 lakh people in its first year. Going by simple projections, it should have been 2 lakh people by now. Let him show us a single person who has benefitted till now. Kejriwal promised Wi-Fi connectivity in all public places. He had even hinted at getting this done in a few months. Delhi needed Rs 3,000 crore for free WiFi, but the AAP government only released Rs 65 crore. It’s been two years and all he could deliver is free WiFi in a few buses,” Jha said.
 
 President Pranab Mukherjee’s daughter and Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee, at separate press conference, enlisted 24 points which AAP had promised in Delhi, but failed to deliver on. “They promised 500 schools in five years. This means that 200 schools should have been built by now. But they have built just one school. Kejriwal promised one lakh jobs in technical sector in one year. By now, two lakh Delhi youths should have been employed. Let him tell the people of Punjab how many jobs AAP facilitated in Delhi,” she said. “Only 274 persons have been given employment by AAP government in Delhi. The only thing which increased substantially in Delhi were the salaries of CM, ministers and MLAs,” she added.
