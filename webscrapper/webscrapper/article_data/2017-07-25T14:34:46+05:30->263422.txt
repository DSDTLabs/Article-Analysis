ROPAR: Family members of a 25-year-old  , who died after delivering a baby, blocked the Ropar-Manali and Ropar-Jalandhar roads protesting against the authorities of Ropar civil hospital. They alleged negligence by the doctors which caused the woman’s death.   (25) had died on Sunday minutes after giving birth to a baby girl.

 Sources said she succumbed after bleeding following normal delivery. However, her family members said the doctors had cut the wrong chord in the womb after which the bleeding could not be stopped.
 
 Charanjit Singh, husband of deceased, said, “It was my first child and I have lost my wife because of the doctors’ negligence as they had cut the wrong chord and the bleeding did not stop.”
 
 The protesters first blocked the road in front of the civil hospital. With no response from the hospital authorities and administration for two hours, they blocked the roads for three hours.
 
 Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who also got stuck due to the traffic blockade, also reached the protest site. He spoke to the Ropar sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and assured the protesters to get them justice after which the blockade ended.
 
 The Ropar civil hospital has formed a panel of three doctors, including surgeon Dr Loveleen Kaur, gynaecologist Dr Charanjiv Kaur, and MD (forensic expert) Dr Harkirat Singh to investigate into the matter.
 
 Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Bharti Rattan of the hospital said, “We have formed a panel of three doctors. On Sunday, Dr Kanchan dealt with the case of a woman who died after delivery. Everything is not in hands of a doctor. The patient died due to complexity of the case as the mouth of her uterus got opened minutes after the delivery.”
