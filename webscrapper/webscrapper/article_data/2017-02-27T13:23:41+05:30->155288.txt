This year’s   favourite   took home the trophy for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her powerful performance in ‘Fences’. The actress was teary-eyed as she accepted the award and went on to deliver a powerful speech, one that celebrated the artists.

 
 
 In her acceptance speech,   said, “People ask me all the time, ‘What kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola?’ And I say, exhume those bodies, exhume those stories, stories of the people who dreamed big and never saw those dream to fruition, people who fell in love and lost. I became an artist and thank God I did. Because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life! So here’s to August Wilson, who exhumed — and exalted — ordinary people.”
  
  
  
 
 This was Davis’ third nomination and first win at the Oscars – the actress has been previously nominated for ‘Doubt’ and ‘The Help’.
