Gurgaon: The district   service authority of Gurgaon held a seminar on Friday to senisitise various agencies involved in protection of child rights on the procedural aspects of child-related laws.

 Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, chief sessions judge Harnam Singh Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (HQ) Deepak Gehlawat and secretary of the DLSA and chief judicial magistrate Narender Singh were the key speakers at the seminar.
 
 “While a number of agencies are aware of the aspects of child laws, some need to be sensitised about the protection of child rights. We imparted the training on three aspects: the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the Juvenile Justice Act (care and protection of children, 2015) and the victim compensation scheme,” chief judicial magistrate Narender Singh said after the seminar.
 
 Members of the Juvenile Justice Board, child welfare committee, district child protection unit, panel advocates of the DLSA, special courts for children, and the child care institutes participated in the seminar. Several NGOs working on child rights were also imparted lessons on child protection laws.
 
 Singh said: “Often these agencies (dealing with child rights) encounter functional problems. At times, it is seen that the laws are not being followed either because of lack of awareness of the amendments or lack of sensitivity.”
 
 Singh said the agencies should step up vigil to identify children who are in need of care and protection. “There might be only 200-250 children who are in conflict with the law, but there are thousands who need to be protected,” he added.
 
 Several agencies in Gurgaon have felt the need to be sensitised about the laws in the wake of the arrest of a 16-year-old student in Ryan International School, Bhondsi, for the murder of a junior.
