UDHAGAMANDALAM: Will   without kernel if the court orders attachment of former chief minister Jayalalithaa’s sprawling tea estate? This primal question has been lingering in the minds of locals since the Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s verdict on disproportionate assets case. 

 Nestled in a picturesque hillock on the north eastern range of the Nilgiris,   gained prominence for the past two decades. It is the second home for the late Jayalalithaa and at times served as seat of power whenever situation demanded. Camping at the estate bungalow, she passed orders to the bureaucracy. 
 
 A tea estate owner, whose property is located close to Kodanadu, told TOI, “The   has been enjoying a VIP status as it houses the retreat of Jayalalithaa. Basic civic amenities such as roads, water and hospital have been provided to the panchayat. Officials used to give more importance to this panchayat. But we don’t know what would happen in the future.”
 
 “Now, we wonder whether the estate or the panchayat would retain the prominence or lose it in the due course,” said Sivasenu, a resident of Kodanadu.
 
 There are many corporate estates in the Nilgiris. “Kodanadu estate would also become one such in the coming days losing its prominence. It is not about the extent of area of the estate. Who owns it matters a lot,” said Sivasenu. He added, “With the death of Jayalalithaa, the prominence of Kodanadu is gone.” 
 
  “We don’t know about the action to be taken by the court as far as   is concerned. If it is sold or auctioned, then the estate would become house of another corporate,” said Kaliaperumal, a resident of the panchayat.
 
 “Not only Kodanadu, the whole of the Nilgiris used to have significance as Jayalalithaa used to visit her retreat frequently,” he added.
