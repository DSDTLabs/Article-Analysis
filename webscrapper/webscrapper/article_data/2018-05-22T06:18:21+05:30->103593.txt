PATNA: Three mobike-borne miscreants shot dead a bank manager on NH-110 near Nihalpur diversion under the Parasbigha police station area in   district on Monday morning. 

 The deceased was identified as Alok Chandra, a native of Kutir village in   district. The 31-year-old was posted at the Bank of Baroda (BoB) branch in Arwal district.
 
 Police are yet to identify the killers and ascertain the motive behind the killing. According to police sources, the incident took place when Chandra was waiting for a bus to go to his workplace.
 
 “The criminals took him to a deserted farm off the road and pumped three bullets into his abdomen around 8.30am. He died on the spot, while the criminals fled on their motorbike,” Parasbigha   Aman Anand told this newspaper over the phone and added police were informed about the incident by locals.
 
 After postmortem at the Jehanabad sadar hospital, the body was handed over to Chandra’s family. “We have recovered three empty cartridges from the spot. The area has been sealed and raids are on to nab the accused,” the SHO said and added though the statement of family members was yet to be recorded, police suspected some family dispute could be the reason for the murder.
 
 However, the BoB management suspected a criminal conspiracy was hatched to murder Chandra. “The bank had filed an FIR against a banking correspondent. While one person was arrested, a co-accused was on the run,” said a bank press release signed by DGM Shailendra Singh.
