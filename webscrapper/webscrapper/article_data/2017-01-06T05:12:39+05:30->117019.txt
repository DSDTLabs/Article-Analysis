CHENNAI: India has a vast collection of museum artefacts, through excavations and seizures, but has few trained employees to take proper care of them, AusHeritage ( 's  ) board chairman   said here on Thursday.

 Daniel was in the city on Thursday to announce the first of a series of workshops, starting on Friday, by curators from museums across Tamil Nadu for a hands-on experience of proper handling of museum collections.The workshop will be organised by Government Museum, Chennai, and AusHeritage.
 
 “More than infrastructure, the biggest need here is trained people,“ Daniel said.“Unlike in the West, it is not looked at [here] as a specialised, skills-set-based profession. It is the same in countries like Indonesia, all over the Pacific, Middle East and parts of Africa.“ Museum collections the ld over are made online, world over are made online, but India still lacks even proper documentation of their possessions, he said. “Major museums in the world have 20 to 30 times more visitors online. In India, there is usually a database for a collection, but whether they have all the information is the question,“ Daniel said.“To transfer documentation of artefacts into the electronic medium, you need trained staff.“
 
 The workshop, focusing on `collection care', will look at 10 variables that may have an impact on collections.These include light, temperature, humidity and lack of trained staff.
