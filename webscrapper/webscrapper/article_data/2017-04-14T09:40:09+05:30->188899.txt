CHANDIGARH: Doctors at the   will soon be marked for daily attendance in the OPD. At present, there is no system to monitor their entry or exit timings. Though the director recently circulated a note to all the doctors to report on time, the administration will soon get strict with those who come late. 

 “We have requested all the doctors be on time in the OPD. Those who are in the ward rounds or in emergency can send a part of their team to the OPD so that the rush of patients can be managed,” said PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram. 
 
 The hospital’s OPD starts at 8am. “Not all doctors enter the rooms on time. This adds to the queues and makes it difficult to manage the OPDs,” said a PGIMER official. 
 
 Sources in the PGIMER administration have confirmed that a three-month period will be given to the doctors and habitual late comers will be issued warning notes. “If we can chargesheet doctors guilty of research misconduct, this issue can also be tackled,” said an official. 
 
 The institute sees patients from the adjoining states of Punjab,   and Haryana. Most of these patients have to stay over for days to see a doctor.
 
  “I stay in Amritsar and have to come for follow ups. It is not possible to see a doctor on time. So we have to arrange for a stay of a couple of days in Chandigarh,” said a patient Sandeep Arora. 
 
 Figures provided by the PGIMER show that there are 1,181 doctors and at any given time 900-1,000 of them man the OPDs. 
 
 Also, there are around 6,731 OPD patients implying that the doctor-to-patient ratio is 1:8. 
 
 “Doctors say that they are overburdened. But we have also increased their strength to streamline the rush. Now if they attend the OPD on time, things can become manageable,” said an official.
