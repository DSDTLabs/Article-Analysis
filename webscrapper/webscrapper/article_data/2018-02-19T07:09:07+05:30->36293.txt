 A group of 25 wildlife photography enthusiasts set off on their week-long adventure across Gujarat. From Sunday to February 24, they will visit six different nature reserves: Thol lake, the Wild Ass Sanctuary at Dasada, Nalsarovar, the Blackbuck Sanctuary at Velavadar, and Gir National Park. The group’s experience architect is noted wildlife photographer Sanat Shodhan.
 
 “When a reputed newspaper group, which has chronicled the issues and progress of social life, makes society more aware of nature and places its issues in a global context, it is like the icing on the cake,” CM Rupani said. “The   Group has done this praiseworthy act, and I congratulate them heartily.”
 
 Rupani said that in newspapers and other media, pictures can speak as well as words, if not better. He said that the Passion Trail will set a benchmark for amateur photographers and youth, and the Gujarat Tourism department was glad to support it.
 
 The Gujarat CM cited a remarkable picture of nine lions — arrayed together — drinking water in Gir, taken by Suleiman Patel which was published by The Times of India. He said this led to the growth of tourism at Gir.
 
 Gujarat chief secretary J N Singh, an avid birdwatcher himself, said: “Birdwatching is one of my greatest pleasures and I can tell all of you from other states that no state has the diversity of birds that Gujarat has.”
