AHMEDABAD: Even as International Women’s Day being celebrated across the globe on Thursday, Gujarat film actress   showed real   and lodged a complaint against a man,  , who was urinating in the open near a complex at Gulbai Tekra.

 Police registered an FIR under sections 110,117, 294 (b) for obscenity in public and using abusive language. Patel owns a photocopy shop in the complex and said he was urinating in the open as the toilet in the complex was being repaired.
 
 According to FIR lodged by Gajjar — who also works in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Marathi films — she had gone to her cousin Payal’s beauty parlour at a complex near Gulbai Tekra on Tuesday evening.
 
 “Gajjar parked beside the road and saw a man urinating in public, just in front of the car. Gajjar honked but the man didn’t pay any attention. After he had finished, he walked up to Gajjar’s car and asked why she was blowing the horn,” said a senior police official of Gujarat University police station.
 
 When Gajjar told him that he couldn’t urinate in the open, Patel allegedly got enraged and used foul language. “Gajjar warned him to hold his tongue or she would make a video of him. Patel got even more agitated and told her to do whatever she could. Gajjar then shot the video and posted it on social media,” added a police source.
 
 Cops swung into action the next day as the video went viral. They arrested the man for urinating in the open and using abusive language against a woman.
