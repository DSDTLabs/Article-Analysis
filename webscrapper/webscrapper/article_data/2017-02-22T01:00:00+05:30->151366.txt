 The story of the film, he says, happens in 1991 and a village near Tirunelveli is the backdrop. “It’s a village where education for women is frowned upon and the heroine, Ilai’s uncle tries to stop her from pursuing her studies as he wants to marry her. He and a landlord’s daughter, who studies with her and is jealous of her, try to stop her from taking her final exam by having her father beaten up. Somehow, the girl attends the exam and even becomes a state topper. What does she do after this forms the plot,” narrates the director.
