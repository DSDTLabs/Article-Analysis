Nagpur:   joined city police as Joint CP on Saturday with barely three weeks to go for civic election. The erstwhile Joint CP Santosh Rastogi was shifted to Mumbai in State intelligence department. Bodkhe would also retain the charge of IG of State Anti-Naxal operation (ANO).

 In its February 3 edition, TOI had already pointed out at the peril of the city police as its crucial post of Joint CP remained unoccupied. State Director general of police Satish Mathur had claimed a day before that the post of Joint CP in city would be filled up ‘soon’. The city police, which is bereft of any officers of Addl CP rank, would now have experience Bodkhe as second-in-command to K Venkatesh.
 
 Bodkhe, an IPS officer 1998 batch, said that he aims at positive approach in policing. “Citizens too should participate in community policing and extend assistance to cops for better outcome,” he said after taking up the charge.
