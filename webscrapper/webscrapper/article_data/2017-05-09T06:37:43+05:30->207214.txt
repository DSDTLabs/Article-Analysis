GUWAHATI: A day after resuming charge as   of the state, the Asam  ,   faced the ire of the   for accepting the position. 

 The committee hit out at Rajbongshi, accusing him of breaking all rules of the Sabha by continuing in the coveted post beyond the specified timeframe for officebearers prescribed in the Sabha rulebook. The reforms committee comprises former presidents of the Sabha and noted litterateurs of the state.
 
 "After stepping down from his post before the centenary session of Sahitya Sabha this year, Rajbongshi said he won't be seen in any post of Sahitya Sabha till 2019. He resumed charge nonetheless," said Gobinda Prasad Sharma, president of the reforms committee. "Dhruba Jyoti Borah announced his resignation from the post of president as Rajbongshi refused to resign following massive public outcry. On what grounds did he then decide to return?" Sarma added.
 
 Calling the move to reinstate Rajbongshi as secretary general and author Dhruba Jyoti Borah as president "illegal", the reforms committee declared the two committees announced by Rajbongshi for ushering "drastic reforms" in the literary body were "null and void". "Their tenure has already ended. So there is no point in Rajbongshi announcing new committees to decide on Sahitya Sabha's future," said former Sabha president, Kanak Sen Deka. Their tenure ended on February 1 this year.
