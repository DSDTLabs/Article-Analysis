CHENNAI: The Madras high court has refused to entertain a PIL seeking re-postmortem of five woodcutters, saying the case fell under the jurisdiction of the   high court.

 When the PIL of advocate P Pugalenthi came up for admission, a division bench headed by Justice C T Selvam suggested to the petitioner that he file a PIL in the Andhra Pradesh high court for remedy. Bodies of five   workers were found floating in a water body at   on the Kadapa-Tirupati highway in Andhra Pradesh on February 18.
 
 The petitioner, Pugalenthi, said the postmortem of P Karuppan, A Chinnapaiyan, A Murugesan, C Jayaran, and C Murugesan — all from   district of Tamil Nadu — had been carried out in a hurried manner at the instance of the Andhra Pradesh police. 
 
 The incident came to light when devotees, visiting a temple in the vicinity, spotted the bodies floating in the tank. TNN
