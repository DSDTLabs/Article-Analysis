HYDERABAD: It has been three days since the general secretary of Telangana   Officers’ Association filed a complaint with the   police station about threatening phone calls, but there has been no headway. The nurses have now threatened to take up the matter with home minister  .

 Earlier this month, the association had lodged a complaint against TV anchors Sreemukhi, Ravi and actor Y Raju for portraying nurses in a derogatory manner in a show ‘Patas’ that aired on March 4. Three days ago, P Susmita Krupa, complained of death threats from ‘fans’ of Sreemukhi. She claimed to have received as many as 30 calls . “The caller said that if I did not take the case back, he would kill me,” she told TOI.
 
 Saroornagar police booked cases, but are yet to investigate the case. “Since the caller used several phone numbers, it is taking time for us to trace the caller. We hope to finish investigation by Monday,” Saroornagar inspector S Lingaiah said.
