Mangaluru: The police on Wednesday busted a fake certificates racket in a city-based institute, which was selling fake degree certificates for courses that it doesn’t even offer, almost two years back, with the arrest of an employee of the institute.

  (MITS), used to sell fake certificates for SSLC, PUC, degree, diploma and BTech courses, for a charge ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 45,000, ever since it started operations in June 2016, police City Crime Bureau (CCB) sources said. MITS is located on TC Road in Thokottu, around 13km from here.
 
 While SSLC and PUC certificates were being sold for Rs 10,000, degree and diploma certificates were sold for Rs 45,000, police said.
 
 The website of MITS reads that the institute is accredited by ISTE, New Delhi, and boasts of offering 17 courses, including technical training, shipping and business.
 
 The police arrested Godwin D’Souza, 33. He was an employee of the institute and residing close to it. Director Askhar Sheikh and principal Askhan Sheikh are absconding. According to the police, the trio was running the racket.
 
 Police said the accused used to target unemployed youth. They used to gather all pertinent information on such youth and issue them fake certificates within a week for a price. They had also been giving certificates to those who sought them voluntarily, police said. MITS used to issue SSLC certificates in the name of Mangalore Public School.
 
 At least 150 students have been issued fake certificates for SSLC, PUC, degree, diploma and BTech courses, police said. Though MITS was established in June 2016, the institute had been issuing certificates dated since 2013.
 
 Police have recovered certificates issued by MITS, a laptop, three fake seals, a printer used to print the certificates, paper and an iPhone from Godwin.
 
 The operation was led by Shantaram, inspector, CCB, Shyamsunder and Kabbal Raj, PSIs, Gurappa Kanthi, PSI, Mangaluru police station, and personnel. An investigation is on.
