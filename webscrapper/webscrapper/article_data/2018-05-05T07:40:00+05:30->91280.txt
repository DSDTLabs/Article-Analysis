Chandigarh: After registration of an FIR against Congress Shahkot bypoll candidate Hardev Singh Ladi in the illegal mining case, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday demanded his immediate arrest.

 SAD senior vice-president Ranjit Singh Brahmpura asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi to explain under what compulsion he had given the ticket to the alleged mining mafia kingpin. The MP said as per the case, Ladi had been prima facie found guilty of theft of natural resources, which itself amounted to moral turpitude.
 
 “This is a charge which has been made against Ladi by his own government and exposes the double standards of the Congress on the issue of corruption and mining mafia,” said the SAD leader. 
 
 The SAD MP said it was strange that on the one hand Gandhi wanted to take credit for dropping Rana Gurjit Singh from the Punjab cabinet and had also claimed to have adopted the same parameter to deny the party ticket to the Reddy brothers in Karnataka. “However in the case of Ladi, despite the presence of a video which proved the Congress leader’s role in illegal mining, Rahul Gandhi chose to bestow him with the party nomination,” alleged Brahmpura.
 
 First, the Congress picked “mining mafia kingpin” and then it compounded its mistake by trying to brow beat the Mehatpur police station SHO Parminder Singh to take back the FIR registered against Ladi. He said that the extent of this pressure and the close links of the Congress government with the mining mafia can be ascertained from the fact that the SHO submitted his resignation on Friday, before being forced to backtrack on that. “This is how police officers, who should be honoured with the President Medal, are treated in Congress government,” he added.
