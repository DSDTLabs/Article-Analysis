Sourav's haldi ceremony starts. Golu asks Dev to come and play with him and Soha. Dev tells him that Soha is unwell and he should go and play himself. Golu is playing with the ball when it drops in the haldi and splashes on the wedding saree.
 
  Bejoy comes and shouts at him. Dev tells Bejoy that Golu is just a kid and he shoudn't be yelling at him. The two start arguing. Asha gets irritated and locks both of them in a room.
  
  Bejoy blames Dev for making him miss his son's wedding. Sona asks Asha to open the room but Asha refuses.
  
  
 
  
  Bejoy remembers having whiskey in the cupboard. Dev and Bejoy drink the whole bottle half-half. They start playing truth and dare. The two then decide to behave nicely with each other for the sake of their family.
  
  In the morning, everyone hears loud music coming from somewhere. They open the room to see Dev and Bejoy dancing happily. Sona sees the empty whiskey bottle. Bejoy then collapses holding his chest.
