PANAJI: The   (NFF) has expressed concern over the poor implementation of the ban on bull or pair   and the use of LED lights equipped with or without generator while fishing in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

 “The fisheries department can neither impound   nor gear as it is not equipped with proper patrolling vessels. Due to this, violations continue unabated in territorial waters and the EEZ,” a press statement released by the forum read.
 
 NFF members further said LED lamps used for such   are mostly in the range of 1,600 to 5,000 watts and are powered by an additional generator, making them capable of attracting fish that are up to 5km away.
 
 “The use of LED lamps will completely destroy the ecology, and fish will go extinct as the LED lights will destroy the nursing grounds of several species,” they said.
 
 The forum has requested the ministry of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries to intervene and amend the order banning the use of LED lamps, and pair/bull trawling, so necessary action is also taken to impound the vessels responsible for indulging in such methods of fishing.
