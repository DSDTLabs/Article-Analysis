Rajkot: The water situation in Jamnagar, the second-biggest city in Saurashtra, is equally grim. 

 Currently, the city gets water on alternate days for 20 to 25 minutes. Water in Aji-3 dam, the main source of water supply to Jamnagar city, will be fully exhausted by March 15. The city gets 30 MLD water from this dam.
 
 Jamnagar municipal commissioner R B Barad said, “Our daily requirement is 100 MLD. We will increase supply from Sagar and Und dam that is expected to last till June 15.” Jamnagar gets only 5 MLD from Narmada. 
 
 Junagadh Municipal Corporation too has already declared water cut and supplies water at an interval of every two days rather than alternate day though the city requires only 25 MLD water.
