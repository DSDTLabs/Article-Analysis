 Works minister Prafulla Kumar Mallik said this in a written reply in the assembly on Monday. He said the money for the ROBs would be divided between the railways and the state government.

 On the basis of these criteria, 23 ROBs will be constructed in Khurda district (which covers Bhubaneswar), 14 in Cuttack, eight each in Ganjam and Angul, six in Puri district, four in Dhenkanal, three in Rayagada, two each in Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak, and one each in Jajpur, Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi, Sambalpur and Keonjhar.
 
 Three ROBs will come up between Barang and Mancheswar stations near the city, according to data supplied by the works department.
 
 A senior railway officer said funds would be sanctioned after the submission of DPRs. Fourteen ROBs have already received funds. The railways has given in-principle approval for 17 ROBs, while the state government has funded two in Khurda and Bargarh, the minister said in his reply.
