Dibrugarh: Hundreds of plantation workers hit the streets here on Thursday seeking revision of daily wage for labourers engaged in over 800 tea gardens of the state. The workers, under the banner of 'Tea Workers Wage Revision Demand Forum', took out a procession from the old railway station to the office of the assistant labour commissioner's office, where they staged a demonstration for nearly two hours. 

 The protesters ended the demonstration by submitting a memorandum addressed to chief minister   which sought the hike of daily wages of tea garden workers to Rs 350 from the current threshold of Rs 137. 
 
 "We are seeking a dignified minimum wage for all tea garden workers which should not be less than Rs 350. There are around 30 lakh tea garden workers across the state who are being greatly exploited in matter of wages. Tea workers in Kerala get a minimum daily wage of Rs 310. It is Rs 263 in   and Rs 241 in  . Here they get only Rs 137. We appeal to the government to ensure fair wages to workers as per the Plantation Labour Act, 1951 and Minimum Wages Act, 1948," the forum's secretary Ghanshyam   said. 
 
 Munda also demanded a change of working hours for tea garden workers. "The British colonial system is still prevalent in the tea gardens as they are made to work for long hours in exchange of paltry wages. We want the working hours to be changed to 9 am to 4.30 pm in place of the currently prevalent 7 am to 4.30 pm to 9 am to 4.30 pm timings," Munda said.
 
 Munda further demanded that the cost of housing, medical expenses, electricity, drinking water, pension, provident fund, gratuity and bonus should not be included as part of the daily wages as is the norm now.
