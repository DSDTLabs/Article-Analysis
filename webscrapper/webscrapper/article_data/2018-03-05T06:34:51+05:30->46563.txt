CHANDIGARH:   leader Randeep Surjewala on Sunday called INLD ‘B team of BJP’. They oppose one another during the day but at night, the national media cell in charge of the Congress alleged. Whenever (PM Narendra) Modi needs him politically, his government allows parole to Om Parkash Chautala, Surjewala claimed. 

 Addressing ‘Bangar Hunkar Rally’ organized by the Congress in Chhattar village of Jind district, Surjewala said it was the BJP government which had levied tax on agriculture for first time in the history of independent India.
 
 “BJP, in its election manifesto, had promised to provide MSP with 50% profit. After taking over, its government filed an affidavit before the   stating in that if 50% profit is provided to the farmers, it will imbalance the market throughout the country. Such are the anti-farmer and anti-public policy of the present government,” the   said
 
 Having giving an opportunity to BJP to rule the state, now the Jind district would serve as the place for voting out BJP from the state. “It is Jind which decides governments and whenever needed, to change them,’’ he said.
 
 Surjewala, without naming Union steel minister Birender Singh, who too has roots in Jind, accused him of ignoring the ‘pure Bangar belt’ of the state. “This is not the failure of CM but the Union minister who failed to reciprocate to the emotions of this district,” said Surjewala.
 
 “So far as the development of his Uchana constituency is concerned, which is currently represented by his wife, they could not spend anything out of the total budget of Rs 95,000 crore sanctioned by the Union and the state governments for the roads connecting villages with sub-divisions and cities. If the steel minister would have brought a steel industry in the area, the things would have been changed at least up to some extent,” he added.
