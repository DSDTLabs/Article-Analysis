NEW DELHI: India is in talks with Quad partners US, Australia and   about establishing a joint regional infrastructure scheme as an alternative to China's ambitious multibillion-dollar One Belt and One Road ( ) project, according to the Australian Financial Review (AFR).

 
 The business newspaper quoted a senior US official saying that the scheme was expected to be discussed between Australia and the US during Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's visit to Washington DC this week.
 
 OBOR is Chinese President Xi Jinping's initiative to create a global network of major infrastructure projects such as ports, rail networks, bridges and roads.
 
 The official told The Australian Financial Review that the plan involving four regional partners was seriously being discussed. However, he added that the "alternative" to China's OBOR was still at a "nascent" stage and "won't be ripe enough to be announced" during Turnbull's visit.
 
 "No one is saying China should not build infrastructure. China might build a port which, on its own is not economically viable. We could make it economically viable by building a road or rail line linking that port," the official told AFR.
 
 Beijing, AFR said, was anxious about the last year's agreement between the four countries in Manila to restore the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD) or commonly known as Quad.
 
 "The QSD was devised last decade to try to contain China but collapsed when the Rudd government withdrew due to pressure from Beijing," the AFR wrote.
 
 The US and her allies, including India, have long been suspicious of OBOR and regard it as a "vehicle for Beijing to exert its influence globally". India is particularly worried because of China Pakistan Economic Corridor ( ), a part of Xi's BRI, that allows China trade route via Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and access the Arabian sea through Gwadar port in Balochistan.
