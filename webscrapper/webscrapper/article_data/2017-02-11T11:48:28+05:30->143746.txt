 Last month, the civic body had directed the company to increase the number of their surveyors to 80 with a target of identifying 20 properties a day. The   is spending Rs 3.72 crore in the project. Once these properties are brought under tax net, the civic body will get additional revenue of at least Rs 7 crore annually.
 
 Property tax superintendent,  , said, “If the firm fails to show progress in the assessment work, a fine of Rs 1,000 will be imposed on a daily basis. Also, the owners of new properties will get notice to register their properties as the tax bills for the current financial year will be issued soon.”
