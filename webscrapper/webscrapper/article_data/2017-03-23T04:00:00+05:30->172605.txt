Ahmedabad: More than 50,000 students failed in the semester-end exams of BCom semester three and five. Around 23,000 students failed in semester 3 while 27,000 failed in semester 5 of Gujarat University. That apart, around 32,000 students of semester 1 had also failed. However, since grace marks upto 35 marks were given to first semester students only, around 8,000 students passed.

 The issue had been represented before the ex-vice chancellor, MN Patel. At that time, Patel had assured that the university officials are mulling over the issue and soon action will be taken about the matter. However, it appears as though the issue is long forgotten after Patelâ€™s term ended last month as there has been no movement on the issue yet. Surprisingly, no student body has represented anything regarding the matter yet. tnn
