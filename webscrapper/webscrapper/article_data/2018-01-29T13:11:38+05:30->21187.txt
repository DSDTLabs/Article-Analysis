 FC Goa’s defence has been shambolic right from their opening game against Chennaiyin FC but the 21 goals conceded in 11 matches now reflects badly on the team. It’s hurting them too and could be an impediment as they make a push for a coveted place among the top four.
 
  Coach   couldn’t quite understand how   could score three goals at home, yet lose 3-4 against  . The loss has pegged them back, and even though they are still among the top four with a match in hand, the likes of Mumbai, Jamshedpur FC and even Kerala Blasters would have smelt blood.
  
  “When you score three (goals) and end up losing 4-3, it's difficult to accept (the result). This was a strange match; (reduced to) 10 players, (conceded) penalty. There are aspects where we need to improve upon,” said Lobera.
  
  Most of the improvement will be needed in defence where mistakes led to Goa’s downfall. Seriton Fernandes’s red card early in the second half and Mohammad Ali’s penalty proved to be the turning point.
  
  “The red card was a big influence on the game. There were small details where things changed. As the second half began, we had a chance with Mandar one-on-one (with the keeper). if he had scored, we would be 3-1 up.
  
  “Two minutes later, we were down to 10 men. That hurt us a lot. But I think we did well to equalise 3-3. With 12 minutes left, down to 10 men, we lacked a little bit of calm. We were 10 players but wanted to win the game. Couldn’t have let the spaces behind when the score was 3-3 and we had a numerical disadvantage. I am content with the attitude of the players,” said Lobera.
