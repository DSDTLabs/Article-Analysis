NEW DELHI: The Delhi government is in the process of constructing seven   across the city, including at least two multi-speciality facilities in Ambedkar Nagar and Sector 9, Dwarka. The other hospitals will come up in Burari, Chhatarpur, Madipur, Siraspur and Sarita Vihar. While most of these hospitals are in the   for almost a decade, the   at Sirsapur is over three decades old. 
 
  
 The Delhi government had bought 20.5 acres from the gram panchayat in northwest Delhi’s Sirsapur in 1986 and handed over the land to the public works department to build a 200-bedded hospital and trauma centre. As per the Economic Survey of Delhi 2017-18, the project estimate has been finalised by PWD but other issues of clearances are still pending. Meanwhile, the current government has decided to increase its bed strength from 200 to 600 beds.
 
 Similarly, the construction of the Ambedkar Nagar hospital was approved in 2013 at a cost of Rs 125.9 crore. The Delhi cabinet, on October 22, 2016, had decided to increase its bed strength from 200 to 600 but the hospital is not ready yet. “The project is expected to be completed in the next financial year,” a government official said.
 
 The land for the Indira Gandhi hospital in Dwarka was bought in 1997 and, as the government record shows, the construction started in 2014. But till now only 64% of the work has been completed. Here, too, the government has decided to increase the bed strength from 750 to 1,500. 
 
 Residents of Chhatarpur often have to bring patients with serious illnesses to AIIMS or Safdarjung Hospital, prompting the Delhi government to acquire 9.2 acres from the local panchayat in 2009 for building a 225-bedded hospital, but the project is yet to take off. 
 
 “The previous government had planned many of these hospitals but they didn’t execute it. We are working on completing them and in many cases with improved infrastructure,” said a health department official. 
 
 World Health Organisation recommends five beds per 1,000 population but, according to the Economic Survey, Delhi has 2.86 beds per 1,000 population. Also, most of the hospital beds are in the private sector. 
 
 A study conducted by AIIMS has found that the central district of Delhi has 10.7 beds per 1,000 population — both in private and government hospitals — against one to three beds in other districts, including the south district covering upmarket areas like Vasant Kunj, Hauz Khas, South Extension and Greater Kailash. The study also showed that New Delhi district has only 213 beds for a population of over 171,000. 
 
 The government has now decided to remodel 16 hospitals to increase the intake capacity. “Around 7,000 beds will be added in these hospitals. For example, we are going to add 444 beds in Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital, 400 beds in Ambedkar Hospital and 386 beds in Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital,” said an official. 
 
 He added that 94 government dispensaries will be converted into polyclinics. 
 
 “We have already made high-end diagnostic services such as CT scan and MRI free of cost at select private facilities if there is a delay in service at a state-run facility,” the official said.
