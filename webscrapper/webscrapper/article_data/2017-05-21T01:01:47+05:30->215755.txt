MUMBAI: “It was a loud thud, the   hit the divider and toppled in an instant. The   on   came to a sudden halt as   and motorists heard the loud wailing of women and children who were trapped inside,” said  , a security guard at a roadside sewerage project just near the accident spot. He was among the first people to rush towards the bus.

 “Along with a few others, I tried to first open the door on the driver’s side (which was then facing skywards) and pull an injured person out. But the man’s leg was trapped,” he said. “I heard him mumble something, probably he was asking me to help him. But his speech was incoherent and he was collapsing. There was nothing I could do as it was difficult to get either him or other passengers out till the bus was brought back to its normal position,” More said. He was dejected to hear that the injured person, identified as Imtiyaz Shaikh (40), manager of the travel agency which booked the bus, had later succumbed to his injuries.
 
 Bharat Thorat, supervisor of the sewerage project, quickly stepped in and arranged for two mini cranes to lift the bus and put it back on four wheels. More, and some good Samaritans from nearby slums, then helped bring the injured out of the bus even as the police and fire brigade arrived and cordoned off the area for rescue operations. 
 
 Auto driver Subhash Yadav’s vehicle was parked 100 metres from the accident spot. “It happened before my eyes and left me stunned. I decided to stay back and help rescue those trapped. A few were sent in autos to hospital, while police took the remaining victims in ambulances to Rajawadi Hospital,” he stated. 
 
 More said it was the timely action taken by locals, before the fire brigade or police arrived, which helped save many lives.
