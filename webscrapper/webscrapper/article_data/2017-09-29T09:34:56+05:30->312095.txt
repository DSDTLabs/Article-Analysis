HYDERABAD: Heavy rains played spoilsport for the thousands of women who had converged in the city, from various parts of Telangana, on Thursday to participate in the   festivities.The poor weather conditions also washed away all plans of the state festival making an entry into the   ­on account of massive turnout. “While women had started gathering at the L B Stadium since afternoon, the sudden rainfall put breaks on their efforts to create the record. Soon, they started to leave in the buses that had brought them to the venue," said an observer present at the site.

 The initial plan of these women walking to the   along Tank Bund also failed to materialise. “We were really looking forward to an evening of celebration and fun, but the rains marred our excitement," said Rukmini Devi, who looked crestfallen by the turn of events.
 
 The organisers' attempts at trying to create a festive mood by   and lighting up by Ghat in many hues, failed to lift spirits. Sources said, around 100 women walked in to the venue by the end of the day .
 
 In other parts of the city too, the situation was much the same. While in scattered pockets, women were seen coming together to set up the traditional   and indulge in dance and music, the crowds were much thinner than usual. Flower sellers who had set up makeshift stalls along stretches, hoping to earn a few extra bucks on the festival, were forced to return home.
