COIMBATORE: The increase in the license fees by the Union government has triggered an increase in driving school fees. The cost, which ranged between 5,000 and 6,000, to get a licence for a four-wheeler, has increased to 8,500. 

 Driving schools say they have to pay higher fees to the   (RTO). But consumer activists say that the fees had been increased after 15 years and has been adjusted for inflation. "There's no reason for schools to charge extra," said a consumer activist.
 
 The announcement was made on December 29 and was implemented from January 6. RTO officials said that this increase in fee has come after 16 years and it was much needed. "The rise in the fee is not exorbitant. It is a Central government announcement and we have to implement it," said an official. When questioned driving school fees would be regulated, the official said that most driving schools charged based on the services rendered and infrastructure provided. "There is little we could do about this," said an officer.
 
 The major increase in the fee is the   of driving schools which has gone up from 2,500 to 10,000. Schools will have to renew this license once every five years. The duplication of the license will cost 5,000. Apart from this, learner's license cost has gone up to 150 from 30 and renewal of driver's license will cost, 200 now. It was 50 earlier. International driving license fee has increased 100%. It was 500 earlier and now it will be 1,000. 
 
 Manager of  , S Chandrasekar, said that these changes in costs would impact driving school fees as well. "The reason for the hike has been digitization and upgradation of the system. We are happy with the move but it will definitely impact our market," he said. 
 
 He also added that the students who enrolled a month ago have also been asked to pay 2,350 extra as they would require that much more to obtain a license. Earlier, it was just 1,000.
