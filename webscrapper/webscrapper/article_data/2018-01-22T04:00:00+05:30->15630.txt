Rajkot: Devbhoomi Dwarka is not only known for its Dwarkadhish temple but also for the nearly two dozen islands along its coast which are a major tourist attraction. Now, the district administration had restricted moments of tourists on islands that are uninhabited. Tourists will now have to take prior permission to visit these islands. 

 There are nearly 24 islands along the coast of Dwarka, Okha and Khambaliya talukas of which only two — Beyt and Ajan — have human habitation. Rest do not have any human habitants. One island, Narara, is placed under the forest department. Many tourists visit these islands and tour operators too arrange special visits to them. 
 
 Through a notification, Devbhoomi Dwarka collector J R Dodia has made it mandatory for tourists to take prior permission from respective mamlatdars to visit the islands. 
 
 “We need to know who is visiting the islands, especially where there is no human habitation. There have been complaints of anti-social activities on these uninhabited islands. If any tourist violates the notification applicable to the 21 islands, marine police can register an offence against them,” Dodia told TOI. 
 
 Tour operators from across the state bring visitors to these islands. While most tourists go to these islands for bird watching, some go to see dolphins in the sea. 
 
 With the new notification in force, tourists will have to submit identity proofs based on which they will be issued permits to visit the islands. 
 
 Harin Bhayani, a tour operator having property in Dwarka and Okha said, “It will be difficult for us to take permission each time. The collector should issue tourist license to us and we should be given the responsibility to maintain records.” Tour operators fear that since most tourists visit on holidays issuing permits may create problems. 
 
 In wake of this development, the local tour operators have asked their customers to inform them in advance about visit to these islands.
