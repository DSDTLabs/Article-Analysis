 may have played a princess in her Bollywood debut, Rakeysh   Mehra’s ' ', but the actress now wants to take up a role that’s closer to her heart — that of a sports star. 
A state-level cricket player, Saiyami told BT, “Sports has always been my first love and recently, there have been a number of biopics on our sportsmen. So, something in that space would be interesting to explore. Actually, I want to play a living sports legend.” Hope the filmmakers are listening.
