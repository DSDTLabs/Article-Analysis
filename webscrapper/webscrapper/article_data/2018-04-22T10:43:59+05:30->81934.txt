HYDERABAD: CPM on Saturday passed a resolution condemning the   and Unnao rape cases and accused BJP of running a ‘rapist rakshak’ campaign after first unleashing a ‘cow protection’ regime in the country.

 CPM politburo member   accused BJP of diverting the country’s attention from the party’s campaign to “prepare bands of men” ( ) for protection to rapists. 
 
 "The government’s decision to bring an ordinance on a death sentence for people who rape children under 12 years lacks credibility. The issue is of certainty of punishment, and the government’s ordinance in no way guarantees that," she said.
 
 Demanding strict action against those protecting rapists, Karat said the statute books already provide death penalty in the rarest of rare cases. 
 
 "In principle, CPM is against death penalty. But, in this context, the actual problem is not that there is no death penalty on the statute books. The actual issue is that those in government are defending the rapists," she said.
