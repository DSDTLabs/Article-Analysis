KOLKATA:   for desperate measures. Caught in a bind after   away her husband’s money, a 44-year-old woman cooked up a story about being robbed to explain the missing cash to her family. What’s more, she even lodged a police complaint regarding the alleged incident that took place in Posta.

 The Bangur Avenue resident had claimed that she was robbed by two persons wielding a razor after she exited a shop in Posta on Sunday. The duo allegedly followed her and made off with two gold bangles and Rs 65,000 in cash. What exposed her lie, incidentally, was the eagerness of some traders in the area to help cops catch the snatchers. When police looked through the CCTV footage provided by the shopkeepers, they did see a man following the woman after she left the shop. 
 
 However, finding no evidence of an attack with a razor, the cops initially surmised that she had been pushed around by the duo and accordingly, the FIR stated: “In furtherance of their common intention, the accused voluntarily caused hurt to the complainant by pushing the complainant.”
 
 But the holes in her story soon started to appear. And when cops questioned her further, she confessed she had made up the incident. 
 
 “There were certain discrepancies in her statement and on Wednesday, after interrogation, the woman finally broke down and stated that no such incident had taken place. She admitted that she came to Burrabazar that day in order to sell her gold bangles to P C Jewellers located at 38, Hariram Goyenka Street in Posta and raised Rs 30,000 in the process. The woman confessed that used to regularly attend kitty parties with her friends where she lost a lot of money. She needed some cash immediately, but wanted to conceal the matter from her husband. That’s why she concocted the story of a robbery and lodged a false complaint with the police,” an officer explained.
