NEW DELHI/GUWAHATI: The Indian   inflicted “heavy casualties” on   (Khaplang) cadres in a major operation in the Mon district of   along the India-Myanmar border in the early hours of Wednesday, turning up the heat on insurgent groups that establish camps in forests across the border.

 The Army said the operation could not be called “a surgical strike” as “Indian troops did not cross the international border”.
 
 It is not possible to put a number but many casualties were suffered by the insurgents, many of whom fled across the border, a senior Army officer said. He added that there were no casualties among the soldiers.
 
 Senior NSCN(K) leader Isac Sumi, however, posted on social media that at least three Indian soldiers were killed in the “encounter”, claiming that it took place on the outskirts of the Langkhu village, located 10-15km inside  , which is under the control of the insurgent group.
 
 But the Army took pains to emphasise that the operation was “not a trans-border one” in the backdrop of Myanmar having expressed unhappiness over the raid almost 10km inside its territory by Indian Special Forces in June 2015.
 
 On Wednesday, around 40 Army Para-Special Forces commandos –– backed by   Rifles jawans –– launched the operation against the NSCN(K) insurgents at about 4.45am. “The operation... lasted over four hours. But after suffering some losses... the insurgents... fled. There could have been some spillover across the border in pursuit of the fleeing militants,” said anofficer.
 
 NSCN(K) is controlled by an Indian Naga, Khago Konyak, after its chairman and a Burmese Hemi Naga, S S Khaplang, died in June. It had unilaterally abrogated a 14-year ceasefire with India in 2015, but its 2012 ceasefire with Myanmar is in force.
