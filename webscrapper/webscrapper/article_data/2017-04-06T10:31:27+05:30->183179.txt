 Mayor A N Jena said police action will be taken against those using the roadside space on their own for parking. "The parking lots have been demarcated and leased out to private parties. It has come to our notice that some touts are operating those without valid license. Our raids will continue on the illegal parking lots," he said.
 
 The BMC has finalized the survey for   (GIS)-tagging of parking spaces. This will ensure that only the authorized parking lots operate. It can keep tabs on unauthorized parking lots as the digital map of the parking space with exact dimension will be available in the Bhubaneswar One web portal, being managed by Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA). 
 
 In January, the BMC had received complaints of unscrupulous elements operating illegal parking lots. They are charging a parking fee more than what is fixed by the BMC. "We have put up details of parking space and the names of the auction holders on our website to avoid confusion. There are 72 authorised parking lots being managed by us out of which 40 have been auctioned to private parties, 26 are being run by BMC and six are institutional ones. Beyond these spaces, there are no other parking lots designated by the BMC," said a BMC spokesperson. 
 
 The illegal parking are operating using fake identity cards. The mayor seized a fake receipt that was being used to collect money from the commuters.
 
  "The managers of illegal parking are asking us to cough up money even though we don't park at the demarcated space," said Rabindra Patnaik, a commuter.
