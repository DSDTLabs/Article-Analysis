Actor   thrilled his new Spanish bride   by performing a flamenco dance and singing to her at their wedding reception.

 
  
 According to a report, the   star exchanged vows with Silva last month, and he made sure his wife had a night to remember by showing off his dance moves.
 
 "When we took the dance floor to dance to this flamenco group and just after a couple steps - because I have to tell you, he is a really good flamenco dancer - Richard took the microphone and he started singing. Everybody was so surprised, including myself," Silva said. 
 
 She said her five-year-old son Albert and Homer, Gere's 18-year-old son from his marriage to  , were ring bearers at the top secret ceremony. 
 
 "The ceremony was beautiful. We exchanged vows and rings - our children were the ring bearers and it was very emotional. I have to admit I cried a lot. When he saw me, Richard said I was the most spectacular woman he had ever seen. And I couldn't stop smiling. I just replied, 'I love you'," Silva said.
