RANCHI: RJD president   has applied for a fiveday parole to attend his son Tej Pratap Yadav’s wedding on Saturday. The plea was made after Lalu’s hearing on provisional bail application could not take place last Friday due to advocates’ agitation in the Jharkhand high court. Lalu is in judicial custody after his conviction in three fodder scam cases related to fraudulent withdrawals from the Dumka, Deoghar and Chaibasa treasuries.

 The former   chief minister was imprisoned in Birsa Munda central jail, where he developed several health related complications and was shifted to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) in Ranchi. Lalu also underwent treatment at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, from where he was referred back to Rims on May 1. Lalu could not attend Tej Pratap’s engagement ceremony in Patna on April 18.
 
 RJD   and Lalu’s close aide Bhola   said: “Laluji has applied for parole to attend his eldest son’s marriage to  , daughter of former minister Chandrika Prasad Rai. We are hoping that the approval will be given. The jail’s inspector general is to issue the order in this regard,” Yadav said. He added that dates of parole would be communicated to the jail department when asked.
 
 He added that the parole application was made when Lalu could not get provisional bail from the high court on medical grounds. Lalu had told the court that he wishes to get his major illnesses, including heart problem, treated at better equipped medical centres.
 
 Officials at Birsa Munda jail in Ranchi said they are looking into the request for Prasad's parole and would take appropriate action. In Ranchi, Prasad's lawyer Prabhat Kumar also confirmed the application for parole for five days — from May 10 to May 14 — for attending his son's marriage.
