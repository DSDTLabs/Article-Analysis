MUMBAI: More than 500   were delayed at the   on Sunday where work to upgrade a navigation aid used by pilots of aircraft on approach to land is being carried on. 

 While the day began well, the six-hour main   closure resulted in arrivals and departures being delayed by an average of 50 minutes in the evening. The main runway 09/27 was not available for flight operations between 11 am and 5pm as work to instal the navigation aid called the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 27 was carried out during this period. 
 
 Flight operations were moved to the secondary runway, which due to various factors can handle only a comparatively lower volume of flights in an hour. By 9.30pm, about 320 departures which account of 70% of total departures that Mumbai handles in a day were delayed, according to data from flightradar24, a liveflight tracking website. 
 
 Around 45 % arrivals (210 flights) were delayed, with the probability of   increasing as the peak hour progressed. The ILS for main runway 27 is expected to be functional by June 2. On Monday too, the main runway 09/27 will remain shut from 2pm to 5pm. Passengers booked on evening flights leaving the city can expect delays.
