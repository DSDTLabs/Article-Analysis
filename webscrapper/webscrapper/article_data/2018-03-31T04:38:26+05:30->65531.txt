 In an attempt to improve health infrastructure in the state, the chief minister also launched the ‘Aarogyam’ app, which is aimed at boosting immunisation for a new mother and child.
 
 The app is designed to issue alerts to users on their mobile phones about immunisation dates in advance. It is also linked to panchayat pradhans, members of the local administration, doctors, frontline health workers and Anganwadi workers of the area. It will also benefit close to one lakh mothers and children, many of whom miss immunisation dates because of lack of alerts, said officials.
