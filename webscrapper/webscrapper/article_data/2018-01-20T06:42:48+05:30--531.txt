BENGALURU: Two friends, both in their late thirties, wanted healthy food for their kids. Unable to trust the stuff available in the market, they chose to dish out healthy delicacies, using millets, mainly ragi. Today, Meghana   and Shauravi Malik, both from New Delhi, are entrepreneurs selling children’s food (cookies and cereals) online under the brand name Slurrp Farm. And their stall at the millet mela on Friday was a star attraction.

 “We just wanted the food to be healthy, tasty and fun. The idea struck us, when, as young mothers, we were starved for several options when it came to food for our children,” said Meghana, who has a fiveyear-old daughter.
 
 Meghana, who was born and brought up Bengaluru, is an engineer and used to work with McKinsey India. An international swimmer,   conceptualized Slurrp Farma. An MBA degree from Harvard helped shape the business model.
 
 Shauravi spent a decade working at JP Morgan and Sir Richard Branson’s Group Holding at the Virgin Group in London. She studied economics at St Stephen’s College and  .
 
 “Since we couldn’t quite find a way, we did the next best thing thing: we founded a company, one that makes the very best for our own children and everyone else’s too,” said Shauravi, mother of a four-year-old son.
 
 It’s a growing enterprise
 
 What started as a small startup a year ago is now a venture with an annual turnover of Rs 36 crore; the duo now plans to supply to brick-and-mortar stores.
 
 Meghana and Shuaravi say their recipes are a combination of what their grandmothers made, with inputs from a nutritionist and paediatrician. The recipes are rigorously tested by   (FSSAI) accredited labs.
 
 “They are primarily tasted and tested by our own children,” the proud entrepreneurs said.
