Panaji: Days after Goa IT Professionals (GITP) called for the scrapping of the tender for procuring 45,000 laptops under the government’s ‘Cyberage’ scheme, the Computer Dealer’s Forum of Goa (CDFG) alleged that the scheme was a scam to “protect the interests of the cartel.”

 The association has also questioned the need for distributing free laptops to all students in Goa, saying that Goa was financially affluent and did not require such benefits.
 
 Raising apprehensions that the tender, floated on May 5 by Info Tech Corporation of Goa, had restrictive clauses to benefit certain computer dealers, CDFG has urged the government to allow students to directly procure laptops from dealers of their choice.
 
 “Dealers are systematically prevented by the restrictive clauses incorporated in the tender and this is perceived to be a deliberate act on the part of the authorities to protect the interests of the cartel,” CDFG president Sidharth Naik said.
 
 “In a financially affluent state like Goa, it is very difficult to understand why the distribution of laptops was not limited to economically weaker sections of society,” CDFG joint secretary Karthik Ganeshan said.
 
 CDFG’s contention is that a monopoly over the state government’s   tender would lead to strangulation of the computer hardware dealers in the state over the next six to seven years.
 
 The association has written to chief minister Manohar Parrikar and minister for information and technology, Rohan Khaunte to intervene and ensure a level playing field for computer dealers.
 
 The dealers have alleged that some computer vendors were participating in the tender process through relatives and proxy companies.
 
 The association has also urged the government to consider limiting the benefits of the cyberage scheme to just once, for a family in five years.
