Vadodara: The rot of corruption in Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) might be much more than the involvement of suspended planning assistant engineer R C Shah and his bosses.

 The anti-corruption bureau (ACB), while seeking further custody of Shah and his accomplice Chirag Patel, told the court that four to five other officers are also involved in the well-oiled system of extracting money for clearing files. ACB officials told the court that since these suspected officials, who are also of the planning assistant engineer rank, are involved, the agency needs to investigate whether they too used to take money through Patel or they have their own middleman.
 
 However, during interrogation of Shah and Patel, the investigating agency has not been able to find out whether the bribe amount was fixed by the middleman or the VUDA officials, who are involved in corrupt practices. ACB said that during interrogation Shah and Patel have not given complete details about the involvement of top officials in sharing the bribe amount. Earlier, Shah had revealed names of top officials of VUDA including chief executive officer Dr N K Meena, town planning officer A Krishna Rao and assistant town planner A C Vyas.
 
 But, the investigating agency did not give their names officially to the court. Shah had admitted that each one of them had 25 per cent share in the bribe amount taken from the applicants for clearing their files. Meanwhile, a senior ACB official told TOI that the agency is taking utmost care during investigation since name of an IAS officer have come out during enquiry.
 
 The agency will also investigate the files which Shah has cleared in the past. ACB told the court that the custody of arrested persons is required since their bank accounts and lockers that have been sealed need to be checked. Shah has two bank accounts and a locker while Patel has admitted having accounts in three banks.
 
 The court granted two days custody of the duo to ACB.
