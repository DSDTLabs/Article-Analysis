SHIMLA: The sudden death of around a dozen bats in Nahan and a few more in Una has created a Nipah virus scare in Himachal Pradesh. Sirmaur deputy commissioner, Lalit Jain ruled out the possibility of virus killing the bats, but the state health director has sounded an alert all the same. An advisory has been issued, asking people to exercise caution even as no case of the virus has been reported from the state.

 
  
 
 The government has also asked all chief medical officers in Himachal Pradesh to send a daily report on any suspected Nipah virus case that they may come across. Also, a toll-free number –104 – has been set up to answer people’s queries on the virus.
 
 It was on Wednesday that a dozen-odd bats were found dead under a tree near the government senior secondary school at Barmapapdi village in Sirmaur. A team of doctors and officials from the veterinary department had visited the spot and collected samples to be tested at National Institute of Virology, Pune and a Punjab government laboratory at Jalandhar. Local authorities at Una too have collected samples of the dead bats and sent them for testing.
 
 “A function was held at a temple in the village where food was cooked near the tree with the bats. We suspect that the bats might have been choked by the smoke. Students playing nearby later dumped the bats under the trees inside the school campus,” Jain told TOI. “Preliminary investigation has ruled out the possibility of the virus killing the bats as there were around a thousand of them in the area but only about a dozen died.”
 
 Chief medical officers of the state, senior medical superintendents of regional hospitals and zonal hospitals and principals of medical colleges in Shimla, Tanda, Nahan, Ner Chowk, Hamirpur and Chamba have been asked to exercise caution.
