 Shetty, the leading lady of ' ', had an uncalled-for visitor, who eventually created ruckus on the film’s set while she was shooting at Film City. The incident, BT has it, occurred a few days ago when the actress, guarded by security personnel, was walking towards her vanity van after the shoot.

 According to a crew member, an unidentified man tried to get close to the actress. The vigilant guards swung into action, and pushed him away before he could reach her and escorted Athiya to her van.
 
 “Athiya was not harmed. In fact, she left the set since her shoot was over for the day. Meanwhile, the man, who had entered the studio floor, which was close to the rear entry of the studio gathered a couple of his friends and tried creating a ruckus on the set. He even gathered some more locals when he felt he wasn’t making enough noise. In the meantime, the internal security of the studio premises and bodyguards from other sets also gathered on our set sensing something was amiss. The man had managed to breach security to catch a glimpse of Athiya and the set. He was sternly warned that if he repeated this, his friends and he wouldn’t get work on any set in future, since a lot of them do odd jobs on the sets inside the studio. The matter was ended there and then. The security has been tightened making it nearly impossible for anyone uncalled-for to lurk around Film City,” says a crew member on anonymity. 
 
 We tried contacting Athiya for her version, but she remained unavailable for comment.
