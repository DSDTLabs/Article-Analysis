Nagpur: Uniqueness of India lies in her diverse culture from which many aspects of leading a meaningful life are worth emulating, said  , director of True Dharma International Buddhist Mission and Research Institute at Florida in the United States, on Thursday.

 Tedesco, a Buddhist scholar who specializes in treatment of patients in the final stage of their life, was speaking on ‘Social dimensions of Buddhism in US’, organized jointly by the department of political science of Nagpur University and International Centre for Cultural Studies at the conference hall of the varsity. Tedesco said he started studying various religions and traditions to ensure that his patients get peace of mind and emotional stability.
 
 He said that it was in the 19th century that Americans began to take interest in Hinduism and Buddhism in their urge to understand the depth of knowledge and started translating Bhagwad Gita and other spiritual books. 
 
 Tedesco said that Buddhists first arrived in North America when Chinese went there in search of employment. However, they took time to adapt to the new culture and spread Buddhism.It was only when American soldiers were deployed in Japan and Korea during war that they learnt the basics of Buddhist culture. Also, in 1960, many Americans started finding answers to their spiritual quest in Asian countries and soon began showing interest in Tibetan Buddhism, he added.
 
 Mohan Kashikar, head of the department of political science and secretary of ICCS and Vinayak Deshpande, former vice-chancellor, were present.
