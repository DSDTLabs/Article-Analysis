Blaming   working president   of selectively blocking contents of the telephonic conversation the two leaders had,   Edappadi K Palaniswami said he had explained to Stalin of the steps taken by the government to end the  .

 “I informed him that the revised wages — minimum of Rs 2,684 and maximum of Rs 11,361 — offered by the government was higher than the earlier wage revisions,” Palaniswami said in a statement on Sunday. “I asked Stalin to explain this fact to trade unions affiliated to his party and get them back to work in a bid to end the hardship faced by the public.”
 
 Referring to media reports of Stalin’s statement issued after his talk with the CM, Palaniswami said, “It is sad that DMK issued a one-sided statement without mentioning the measures taken by the government.”
 
 Stalin, however, said his primary demand was that Palaniswami should personally hold talks with the trade unions to end the strike.
 
  “When I asked the CM to hold talks with the trade unions, he said ministers were on the job. I told him it would be better if he personally spoke to trade union leaders and asked him why he was refusing to talk to them,” Stalin told reporters in Chennai. 
 
 “This isn’t just my demand but the demand of all opposition parties in Tamil Nadu. He should hold talks immediately,” the DMK leader added.
