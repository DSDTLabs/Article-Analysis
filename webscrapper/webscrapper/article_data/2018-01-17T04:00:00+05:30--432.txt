Rajkot: Assistant commissioner of Junagadh Municipal Corporation (JMC) allegedly slapped a medical officer at the civil hospital on Monday, which sparked anger among the doctors who went on flash strike. 

 Praful Kaneria, the assistant commissioner, assaulted medical officer Dr Jay Kansagara after accusing him of not giving immediate treatment to two accident victims he had brought to the hospital. 
 
 Angry doctors decided to refrain from work. Later in the night, local MLA and senior JMC officials met them and the issue was resolved. However, Kaneria was booked for obstructing a public servant from discharging his duties and assault.
