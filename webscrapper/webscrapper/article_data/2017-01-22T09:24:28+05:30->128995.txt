MUMBAI: If the Bangladesh and the Australian teams have begun planning for their forthcoming Test tour of India, they would do well to pause at the way   was dismissed on Day Two of the   tie here at the Brabourne Stadium in Cricket Club of India (CCI). Batting as if he was playing on a different pitch even as the other Rest of India batsmen kept walking back to the pavilion, the in-form India No. 3 seemed set for another hundred this season when he decided to hook a bouncer from Gujarat seamer Ishwar Chaudhary.

 However, with his body position hardly ideal for the shot, all the 28-year-old, who otherwise left one enchanted with his classy drives, cut and pulls, managed to do was edge the ball to wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. It ended a superb knock (86, 156b, 11x4) from a batsman who's hardly put a foot wrong in the past few months, but who still needs to work on his ability to play the hook shot, or leave the short ball alone.
 
 The Saurashtra man managed to stand tall on a day which saw ROI slip deep into mediocrity, even as Gujarat shone brighter and brighter. After the opposition finished at a creditable 358, the likes of Chennai triple centurion   (28), Abhinav Mukund (8),   (12) and Wriddhiman Saha (0) flattered to deceive as ROI slumped to 206 for nine. Trailing by 152 runs currently with just one wicket in the bag, ROI look set to concede a substantial first innings lead going into Day Three of this contest.
 
 The difference between the two sides has clearly been the fielding, which has been quite stark to say the least. While ROI grassed two catches (they overall dropped four chances in the first innings) on Saturday morning to allow Gujarat to stretch their total, the latter pulled off a couple of blinders to reflect the gulf in commitment between the teams for this game.
