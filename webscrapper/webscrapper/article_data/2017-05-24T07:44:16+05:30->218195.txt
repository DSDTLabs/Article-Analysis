HYDERABAD: One of the most eagerly-awaited arrivals in the state these days are two goods trains from Kolkata carrying the precious cargo of 35 lakh   purchased by the  . These ‘gunnies’ could stave off a potential disaster for  , who have been   at market yards.

  farmers, by the end of the procurement season in June, are expected to bring in 44 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of produce, much more than the original projection of 38 LMT. The addition of 6 LMT of paddy has left the civil supplies department scrambling to procure an additional 1.5 crore gunnies. As per the original crop estimates, the department had made plans to procure 9,45,95,450 bags.
 
 One of the goods trains is expected to bring 17 lakh gunnies in about two days, but the rest is up in the air. It is learnt that gunny manufacturers in Bengal are yet to deliver to the Railways the last tranche of the order of about 18 lakh gunnies. In the meanwhile, officials said they managed to get 1 crore gunnies using ‘friendly sources’ in neighbouring states since March to overcome the shortage.
 
 “We decided for the first time in the country to use road transport to cut down delays and this worked well,” CV Anand, commissioner of civil supplies told TOI. This also resulted in cutting the transportation cost of each bale of 500 gunnies to Rs 1,000 from Rs 1,600. But the road transport experiment was resisted by some labour groups in Bengal along with some in the jute mills sector as well as the Railways as it dented their income.
