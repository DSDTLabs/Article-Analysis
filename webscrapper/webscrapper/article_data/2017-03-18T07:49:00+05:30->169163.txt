BATHINDA: In a case of honour killing, a 28-year-old woman was allegedly murdered by her two brothers and mother in Bathinda on Thursday night for having a live-in relationship with a man in their village,  , without divorcing her husband. 

 A case of murder was registered against deceased Beant Kaur’s brothers, Seera Singh and  , and mother Baljit Kaur at Nathana police station on Friday morning, hours after the woman’s body was found in the neighbouring Gulabargh village late on Thursday night, said Nathana station house officer (SHO)  . They, however, are yet to be arrested. 
 
 Beant married Gobindgarh village resident   nearly three years ago. However, as relations strained between the two, she moved out and started living with Lakhbir Singh, complainant in the case, for the past few days.
 
 Lakhbir alleged in his complaint that he was not at home when the accused came along with a few of their other relatives and bundled her in a car. The SHO said that they found Beant’s body, riddled with injuries inflicted by sharp-edged weapons, a few hours after the complaint.
 
 According to villagers of Tungwali, Beant’s family was against her living with a man of the same village without divorcing her husband. “Though they tried to persuade her to leave, she did not hear them out,” the SHO said. 
 
 The SHO added that efforts were on to nab the accused.
