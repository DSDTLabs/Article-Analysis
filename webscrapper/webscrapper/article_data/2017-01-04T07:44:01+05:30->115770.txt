MUMBAI: Fresh trouble is likely for   in   where the police unearthed an illegal   carried out in July last year. The Mumbai police is now awaiting a nod from the state health department to register another couple of cases of illegal transplants against the hospital and its doctors.

 The police have written to the state health department, seeking their report on five transplants between 2014 and 2016. But officials said despite three to four reminders, the health department had not replied so far. “There are at least five to six suspected transplants that took place in last two years. Our investigations suggest these were illegal, but unless the health department verifies the documentation and legalities, we cannot go ahead.We are waiting for the last four months," said an officer.
 
 The police added that there are reasons to believe these transplants were suspicious as there are discrepancies in documents of donors and recipients, including names and addresses. “We have referred the cases to the state-appointed panel to find out if the hospital's authorities and its transplant authorisation panel followed rules and procedure,“ said a police officer.
 
 However, a senior health official said the cases cannot be easily investigated. “In a couple of cases, the recipients have passed away and others are out of state,“ said the official.
 
 A spokesperson for Hiranandani Hospital declined to comment.
