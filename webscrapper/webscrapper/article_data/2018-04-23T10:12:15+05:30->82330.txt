MUMBAI: L N Mittal-led ArcelorMittal will have to ensure that the outstanding debt of   and   are repaid to be in the race for Essar Steel.

 
 A detailed reading of the 89-page order by the National Company Law Tribunal ( ) reveals that the ArcelorMittal Group was in control of both Uttam Galva and KSS Petron — which were non-performing assets (NPAs) — when the resolution process began. Uttam Galva has outstanding loans of Rs 5,654 crore, while KSS Petron has Rs 1,340 crore.
 
 The tribunal observed that ArcelorMittal has been a promoter of Uttam Galva since 2009 and the company was an NPA in the books of Canara Bank and   as of March 2016. Also, on the date of commencement of corporate insolvency resolution process — August 2, 2017— ArcelorMittal was connected to both the defaulting companies. “In order to become eligible, overdue amounts to lenders, in both the cases of KSS Petron and Uttam Galva Steels, should be paid by ArcelorMittal before being eligible to bid as provided in Section 29A itself,” the order said.
 
 TOI had reported that the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT had asked for a review of the bids presented in the first round of the Essar Steel auction. The order was in response to two separate applications made Numetal and ArcelorMittal — the only two bidders in the first round — seeking to be recognised as eligible bidders. 
 
 The tribunal had returned the matter to the committee of creditors (CoC) stating it had not followed the process.
 
 From the order, it can be discerned that the NCLT is of the opinion that even when bids are put in by promoters who are in default, they should have an opportunity to participate provided they pay back the entire outstanding debt.
