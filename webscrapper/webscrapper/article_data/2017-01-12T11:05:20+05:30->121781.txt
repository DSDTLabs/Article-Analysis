While kite flying continues on the eve of Makar Sakranti, Roshni is unable to bear Vaidehi's growing proximity with Piyush.
 
 She drinks the intoxicated substance and begins to humiliate Vaidehi in front of the entire Bharadwaj family. She accuses her of playing tricks to gain rich men like Piyush. 
  
 Unable to control his anger, Piyush slaps Roshni and confesses his love for Vaidehi. He tells Vaidehi how they are made for each other. But just then, she looks at Roshni and goes away. 
 
 
 
 
  
 While Roshni is about to faint, Piyush runs after Vaidehi to get her back. Simar consoles an upset Roshni.
  
 Later, Anjali provokes Roshni further to seek revenge from Vaidehi.
