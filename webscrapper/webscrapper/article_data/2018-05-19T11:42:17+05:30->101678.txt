HYDERABAD: The residential real estate market in the country’s top seven cities grew by 6% in April, with developers adding 15,200 units to the existing stock, as per the latest report published by real estate consultant  . Of these, over 1000 units were added in Hyderabad alone.

 
 New housing supply was highest in the   this year, followed by Hyderabad. As per the report, the maximum number of new residential units were added to the ‘affordable housing’ category.
 
 Of the total new supply in April, nearly 43% was in the affordable housing category, followed by 33% in the mid segment, 11% priced in the range of ?80L-?1.5 crore and the remaining 13% in the segment priced above ?1.5 crore, says the report.
 
 Backed by high consumer demand for affordable homes, most builders are predominantly launching properties in affordable and mid-range segments. Thus, the weighted average prices of new properties have seen a dip in cities like NCR, Pune and Hyderabad,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock Property consultants.
 
 Puri said the average size of residential properties is also shrinking across the country to meet the ‘affordable budget’ criterion.
