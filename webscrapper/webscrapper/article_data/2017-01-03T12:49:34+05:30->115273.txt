SHIMLA: A man brazenly walked away with a trunk containing over Rs 1 crore in demonetised currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination from a bank in the heart of Shimla right under the noses of the staff and security guards. 

 The theft, which occurred on December 26, 2016, when the bank was teeming with customers, came to light when the staff of UCO Bank on Shimla's Mall Road were carrying out their "reconciliation process". 
 
 A case was registered on Monday after bank officials lodged a complaint, a week after the incident. 
 
 In his complaint, bank chief manager Surender Kaul, alleged that two trunks having currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 amounting to Rs 3,37,75,500 were deposited by the Naina Tikker branch on December 6. 
 
 Kaul said that it was while tallying the cash that he found that one of the trunks containing Rs 1,03,00,000 in cash was missing. He said the   footage revealed that an unknown person, whose face was clearly visible, had taken the trunk at around 3.53 pm on December 26.
