NEW DELHI: Desertion by a spouse is not to be decided merely on who left the matrimonial home first as the conduct of one half of the   could force the other to live separately, the high court has said.

 A bench of justices   and   said desertion is “not a withdrawal from a place“ but a repudiation of all obligations of marriage and the abandonment of one spouse by the other without any reasonable cause or consent of the other. It made the observation while setting aside the divorce granted to a husband by a family court on the ground of desertion by the wife, saying, “The record reveals the respondent (husband) rather had deserted the appellant (wife) and even today she has to fight for her maintenance.
 
 “Thus, looking at the material which has come on record it is clear the wife had sufficient grounds to live separately.
 
 “We are of the view that Judge, Family Court,  , has misread the evidence and though the appellant (wife) left the matrimonial home, she never wished to bring her marital ties permanently to an end,“ the bench said.
