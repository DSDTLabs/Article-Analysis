VARANASI: Spending more time in his Lok Sabha constituency than he did in the 2014 campaign, Prime Minister   will visit   on the banks of the Ganga on Monday. 

 With Varanasi set to go to polls on March 8 along with six districts, the PM’s visit to Gadwaghat Ashram is politically significant as Yadavs here are close to the Ashram. 
 
 Among several political figures visiting the ashram is SP leader Shivpal Yadav, who frequently visits the place with his family. 
 
 SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and   have also visited the Ashram. 
 
 The ashram has more than 2 crore followers from across castes. It has 125 branches throughout the country. It was set up in 1930 by ‘Dada guru’ Shri Shri 1008 Swami Adhvyaitanandji Maharaj. During his visit, the Prime Minister is expected to meet the present Peethadheeshwar Shri Shri 108 Sarnanandji Maharaj.
 
 According to Ashram caretaker Radhey Shyam, Modi has been willing to visit the Ashram since the Lok Sabha elections of 2014 but could not make time for it. 
 
 In the late 90s, the BJP had held its national consecutive at the Ashram when Union home minister Rajnath Singh was UP BJP chief and Kushabhao Thakrey was the national BJP chief.
