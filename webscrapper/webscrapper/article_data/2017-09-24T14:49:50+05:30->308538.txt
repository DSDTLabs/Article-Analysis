The Devi has set out of Mt   and will reach on time, but Dev is already here -at metro stations, on buses, roadside lampposts, gigantic billboards, eye-level cutouts; the other day, he was smiling down at me from a hoarding promoting underthings right in front of my gate! With five other films screaming for attention and one to join in soon, Dev seems to be towering above everyone, from what else but the cockpit! The actor-MP , who had a humble beginning around a decade back, has truly emerged as the enfant terrible of Tollywood. After he got wind of his   being replaced by another adventure -that of the Yeti -he got to the task of making a film that would truly touch the skies. He roped in the dependable   as director and got on board pretty faces like   and  . So what if his choice of music got him into a bit of a trouble, this season there's no stopping Dev. While he has shown how well a film can be promoted, his detractors won't stop short of maligning him for what they feel is abuse of power. But then, power breeds corruption and those who made Dev what he is today, would have me believe just that. To make things difficult for Dev, his once-upon-a-time mentor -You Know Who -tied up with the makers of Projapoti Biskut and hall owners were given a choice -to give the best of shows to Yeti Obhijaan, Projapoti Biskut and   or show Dev's Cockpit. I heard the actor was busy promoting his film mid-air when some on-ground activities cost him a few good shows.But enmity in this industry doesn't last longer than friendship. Come December, Dev and He Who Must not Be Named will bring their obhijaan together. Till then, they can behave like the amazing beasts of Amazon.
