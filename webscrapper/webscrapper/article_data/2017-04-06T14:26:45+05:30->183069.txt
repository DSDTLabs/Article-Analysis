BHAGALPUR: Even as the Supreme Court is hearing a petition chalenging the legality of  , a young woman from Bhagalpur has sought the intervention of PM Narendra Modi to save her marriage after her husband last month divorced her over phone from Dadar and Nagar Haveli.

 The woman in 20s, who has a 3-year-old son, is running from pillar to post to get permission to meet the PM when he visits neighbouring Sahebganj in Jharkhand on Thursday.
 
 Bibi Rukhshar is the daughter of Abdul Khalid of Kujbanna village in Pirpainti block of Bhagalpur district. Married in 2010 to   of Bansatti village under the Ishipur police station area in   of the district, she got a call from husband on March 27 this year. “All that he told me was ‘talaq, talaq, talaq’,” she said.
 
 “At the time of marriage, my father fulfilled all the demands of in-laws. Yet they tortured me for more money and gifts. At times, relatives and village elders, including the local mukhia, had to intervene and counsel my in-laws,” Rukhsar told TOI on Wednesday, adding she was at her parents’ house when she got her husband’s last call on mobile from Dadar and Nagar Haveli where he works as a clerk in a private firm.
 
 The woman has since met quite a few people, including Pirpainti sarpanch  , asking for help in her “fight for my and my child’s rights”. “I know PM Narendra Modi will take up the cudgels on behalf of women like me. That is why many Muslim women voted for him in the UP election. He will help me when I narrate my story to him on Thursday,” said the middle school dropout who has of late gathered details about the triple talaq issue issue from the various NGOs she visited.
 
 Pirpainti sarpanch Barun Goswami said he was with Rukhsar while Pirpainti BDO Rakesh Gupta said on Wednesday the administration would do whatever was possible within our legal framework to help the woman.
