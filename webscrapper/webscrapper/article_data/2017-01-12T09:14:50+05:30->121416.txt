VASCO: The   building is likely to undergo repairs and get a face lift soon after the code of conduct for   comes to an end. 

 Jail authorities started shifting the inmates to   from Monday.
 
 The shifting started following the inspector general of prisons Siddhivinayak Naik’s order. Since Monday, 49 inmates have been shifted and the reminaing 65 will be shifted till January 20. Along with the 114 inmates, about 45 staff will also be shifted to the Colvale jail. A special separate wing at Colvale is allotted to Sada sub-jail inmates and this wing will operate as Sada sub-jail for approximately six months till the civil works are done.
 
 Naik said, “Whether the PWD’s building section will opt for renovation or rebuild the structure, will depend on their upcoming inspection.” He admitted that the building is in a dilapidated condition. The sub-jail was inaugurated in 1996. It has been seen on numerous occasions that the building is not safe enough to hold the inmates. About few months ago, a portion of the slab had collapsed in one of the cells. The wall plaster had fallen at many places. The window panes, too, could be easily kicked off from the walls.
 
 The sub-jail has other problems, like its drainage system is completely choked and rodents have gnawed the   wires to an extent that no footage can be recorded.
