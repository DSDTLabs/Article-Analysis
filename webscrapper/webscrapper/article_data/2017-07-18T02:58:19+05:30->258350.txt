NEW DELHI: The 10-year-old-boy, Vishal, who died under mysterious circumstances in Rohini’s Begumpur on Saturday, could have been   at school, the family said on Monday. He was to celebrate his birthday on July 19 and was promised a remote- controlled car by his parents.

 “I had taken an off to buy the gift, but could not go as he complained of uneasiness. He, however, went to play with his friends for some time. When he came back he complained of excessive chest pain and fell unconscious,” said Ram Babu, Vishal’s father. 
 
 Remembering Vishal, Babu said he rarely went out to play and concentrated in studies as he aimed to top his Class V exams. Narrating the incident, Babu said that Vishal returned home earlier than usual that day. It was later in the evening that his health deteriorated and he was rushed to a hospital. 
 
 The family was, however, asked to shift the   to another hospital. “My son could not utter a word. He clenched his fist and tried to speak but I failed to understand anything. He whispered that he was thrashed by a group of three students and that he knew none of them. After this, he fell asleep,” Babu said. 
 
 His condition only worsened with the passing time and he was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital but was declared dead on arrival. “We tried getting details all our way to the hospital, but he did not respond,” said the doleful father. It was then that the police were called and the matter was reported. 
 
 The body has been shifted to   for autopsy and reports are awaited. “We are questioning the boy’s teachers and classmates to ascertain what possibly could have gone wrong and are investigating further,” said Rishi Pal, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini).
