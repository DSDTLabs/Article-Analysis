His ability to make people laugh effortlessly is what is special about Kannada actor Sharan. That is exactly what comes to mind when one thinks about the actor. In his long years in the industry, both as supporting actor and hero,   has been a part of quite a few song-and-dance numbers, but his prowess as a dancer was rarely in the spotlight. Until, of course,  , in which choreographer   master got the actor to really push himself — the result of which is the dancing star in numbers like   and the title track, Raj Vishnu.
“I have worked with Sharan on multiple films and seen his willingness to at least try when something new is suggested. He will never outright say that it is beyond him. Which is why he insists on spending at least 3-4 days in rehearsal before even fixing a date to shoot the sequence. This gives him enough time to figure out if he can pull it off or not. For Raj Vishnu, I told him about my plans for the songs and his immediate reaction was, ‘Let’s try it’. That gave me the confidence to choreograph a few fast and difficult steps, which he executed to the best of his abilities and the result is for all to see. The Dhool Yebbrusso song has already had over two lakh views, which is testimony that people have liked it,” says Murali.
