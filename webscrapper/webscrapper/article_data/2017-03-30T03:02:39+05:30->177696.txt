NEW DELHI: Besides chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, five cabinet ministers and MLAs, the list of 40   prepared by   includes four faces who led the Punjab poll campaign. Veteran lawyer and leader of the opposition in the Punjab assembly, H S Phoolka; members of Parliament, Bhagwant Mann and Sadhu Singh, as well as actor and popular AAP member Gurpreet Singh Waraich will hit the campaign trail in Delhi.

 Besides sharing AAP’s philosophy, Phoolka will be reaching out to the Sikh families affected by the 1984 riots. AAP has submitted the list of star campaigners to the state election commission. The party is hoping that it will be able to get these star campaigners to address more than 1,000 ward sabhas. 
 
 AAP plans to step up its campaign, starting with the first public meeting of CM and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal in Burari on March 31. 
 
 Ashish Talwar, AAP’s Delhi in-charge said, “Our campaign strategy is Delhi-centric. We know that Delhiites want to hear about solutions to their problems from the leaders of Delhi. Also, MCD elections are highly localised and we will be holding ward-wise meetings.”
 
 The list of star campaigners has MLAs drawn from different pockets of the city. Some of them are Dwarka MLA Adarsh Shastri, Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba, Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan, Seemapuri MLA Rajendra Gautam, Mangolpuri MLA Rakhi Bidlan and MLA from Greater Kailash Saurabh Bhardwaj. Senior AAP functionaries like Sanjay Singh, Pankaj Gupta, Ashutosh, Kumar Vishwas and Delhi convener Dilip Pandey also figure in the list.
