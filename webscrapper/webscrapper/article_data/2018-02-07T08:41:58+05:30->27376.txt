MARGAO: Stating that the government will spend Rs 300 crore in procuring quality mobile toilets having a biodigester system, chief minister   said that his endeavour would be to ensure that no house remains without a toilet by October 2.

 “Else, we won’t be able to claim that Goa is a progressive state,” Parrikar said. Each unit will cost Rs 40,000. Around 70,000 homes in Goa do not have toilets.
 
 Parrikar is on a mission mode - an ‘open defecation free Goa’. In his over 12-hour long tour of the Curchorem constituency on Tuesday, Parrikar sought the co-operation of the local panchayats, the municipality, community organisations, religious leaders and the general public to contribute their mite to the Swacch Bharat initiative.
 
 Addressing a gathering at Assolda, Parrikar said that a bill would be tabled in the forthcoming assembly seeking to prosecute the house owner who keeps tenants without providing them toilet facilities. He delivered a similar message to the members of the Fabrica of the local church, priests and chapel committees. “As community and religious leaders you have to put before the people this issue of making the state open defecation free, which is central to human dignity. You need to make this awareness,” he said. 
 
 About the public outcry over the Mhadei issue, Parrikar, at one meeting, said that only the judgement of the Mhadei water disputes tribunal was crucial for Goa. Education and employment were the other two issues, Parrikar dwelt at length in his meetings. While at Xeldem and Assolda, he listened to public grievances and in many cases offered spot solutions, at the Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council, Parrikar, along with Curchorem MLA   reviewed various upcoming projects.
 
 Parrikar inaugurated the beautification of the traffic island at   chowk and the four lane road. Also present were tourism minister Manohar Azgaonkar and Cabral.
