PUNE: Four cab drivers were arrested for robbing three other cabbies of cash and valuables at   in Wakad around 4.15 pm on Friday.

 Images caught on a   (CCTV) camera revealed the cab drivers’ involvement.
 
 Senior inspector Shridhar Jadhav, in-charge of the Wakad police station, told TOI on Saturday that the suspects posed as customers and booked cabs. They called the drivers to Dange chowk one after the other, and then beat them up and robbed them of cellphones and cash.
 
 Jadhav said, “While investigating the case, we checked CCTV camera footage and identified one of the robbers as a cab driver. We took him into custody and during interrogation, he confessed his involvement in the crime and revealed the names of his three accomplices. Following this, they were arrested from various places.”
 
 The four men Mayur Giri (27), Sugriv Manchale (23), Vishamber Kulkarni (27) and Shrikant Honkalas (29) had robbed the cab drivers because they had not participated in a recent strike called by the drivers of private cab aggregators demanding an increase in commission, Jadhav said. 
 
 He added that they have been charged with armed robbery under sections of the Indian Penal Code. He added that a cellphone has been recovered from one of the suspects.
