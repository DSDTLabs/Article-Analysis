CHENNAI: Transport unions on Tuesday called off their strike after an assurance from the government that it would release Rs 1,250 crore pending dues to retired and serving employees of eight transport corporations. Buses will operate normally from Wednesday.

 The unions’ decision to call off the strike comes after a three-hour session with senior ministers K A Sengottaiyan, P Thangamani and transport minister   at the Secretariat. “We conveyed the concerns of the transport workers to chief minister  , who in turn agreed to allot Rs 1,250 crore immediately. He also gave an assurance to release the pending retirement dues of Rs 700 crore by September end,” Vijayabaskar said.
 
 The ministers held talks with the union leaders hours after the Madurai bench of the Madras high court criticised the indefinite strike by transport workers, and warned them of action under Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) provisions if they continued with their agitation. The representatives of the striking trade unions were told to appear before the court on Wednesday. 
 
 The unions, including DMK’s   and CPMaffiliated CITU began strike since Sunday, after five rounds of talks with the minister failed. Incidentally, the unions had called off their strike after getting an undertaking from the state that there would not be any “victimisation” and the two-day strike period would be treated as “leave.”
