KOLKATA: The Nipah virus (NiV) outbreak may still be restricted to Kozhikode and   in Kerala but the state health department is leaving no stone unturned in preparedness. In addition to issuing guidelines to district health officials and administrators of all hospitals to be on the alert, nodal officials have also been selected and   has been asked to gear up in case of an outbreak.

 
 The health department has identified ID Hospital Beliaghata as the apex hospital for NiV. The wing of Integrated Disease Surveillance Progamme (IDSP) in   has been activated. All hospitals have been asked to report any case of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) on daily basis. A nodal officer in Swasthya Bhawan has also been entrusted to keep a track of all the action taken by hospitals in case of an AES case.
 
  
  
 
 AES cases start with acute fever, respiratory distress accompanied by neurological manifestations like confusion, disorientation and lastly coma. The characteristics of AES are symptoms of NiV infection.
 
 All deputy CMOHs have been asked to resume the role of nodal officers for IDSP of the respective districts. The CMOHs are supposed to gather information from health facilities about AES cases and gather information about the past 21-day travel history of the patient.
 
 “In case of patient with unusual AES pattern, the cause of disease has to be investigated immediately before the samples are tested for NiV. But in any case, an AES suspect has to be reported to the state health department headquarters,” said a Swasthya Bhawan source.
 
 If an AES suspect case is reported, the patient should be guided by the concerned district/wings or hospitals and take a call whether the patient needs to be quarantined in an isolation ward. “There is no Nipah virus scare in the state as of now. But we need to remain prepared in case out an outbreak,” said a health department official.
