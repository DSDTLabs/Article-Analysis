NEW DELHI: The Delhi   recently sought the Centre’s response on a plea challenging a December 2017 notification penalising   fitted with   or bull bars.

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar, however, also questioned the petitioner, a bull bar manufacturer, on the need for crash guards in the capital.
 
 “Within the city, when there is a speed limit, why do you (vehicle owners) need crash guards,” it remarked, while asking the ministry of road transport and highways to respond to the PIL.
 
 HC’s poser to the ministry came in relation to its December 7 notification asking all the states to act against crash guards, installed at the front and rear of vehicles, saying they “pose serious   to pedestrians as well as occupants of the vehicles.”
 
 The petitioner challenged the ministry’s letter to the states claiming that bull bars are “useful safety accessories” and there is no rule or law dealing with it. 
 
 Arguing that due to the Centre’s decision to penalise vehicles installed with crash guards, the petitioner contended his family members and those employed by him are being affected financially. The petitioner has sought a stay on the operation of the ministry’s direction claiming its decision has no legality as there is no rule, law or bylaw dealing with accessories such as crash guards or bull bars.
 
 The dealer also said that bull bars do not fall under the purview of Section 52 of the Motor Vehicles Act, because the section pertains to modification in a vehicle and not with after-market fitments.
 
 According to the Act, “No owner of a motor vehicle shall so alter the vehicle that the particulars contained in the certificate of registration are at variance with those originally specified by the manufacturer.” 
 
 Violation of this provision attracts a fine of Rs 1,000 for the first offence and Rs 2,000 for subsequent offences.
