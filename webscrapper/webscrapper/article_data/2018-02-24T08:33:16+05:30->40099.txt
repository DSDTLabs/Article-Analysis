NEW DELHI: Complex state and federal regulations in tax regimes, which created friction and inefficiency within the economy, have been a drag on Indian growth, the chairman of consultancy firm   International   said on Friday.

 Applauding the government’s reform measures, he said Centre’s commitment to minimum government and maximum governance was significant to addressing some of the challenges that the country faced.
 
 In this regard, he said the rollout of the Goods & Services Tax (GST) was a key step to demonstrate its commitment to reforms.
 
 Addressing the  , Thomas highlighted the difficulties in the tax system, infrastructure and the digital economy.
 
 “The reality is that our clients and our own businesses have struggled to reach their full potential. We faced levels of complexity, levels of bureaucracy that have hampered India’s economic progress,” Thomas said.
 
 He said outdated and poor infrastructure has been another historical overhang and drag on growth and “in many ways, India’s infrastructure challenge has been a physical manifestation of complex web of national and state responsibilities.”
 
 Thomas said moving people in India is simply too difficult and the limitations of the transport sector certainly and undoubtedly slowed the pace as he detailed the opportunities in the infrastructure sector. “In this digital age, this historic fragmentation and lack of alignment between the national and state governments has slowed India’s vital investments in the digital infrastructure that will enable much of the next phase of India’s economic development,” Thomas said, referring to the complexities in the digital economy.
 
 He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech at Davos earlier this year sent a very powerful message to investors around the world as well as political leaders from several nations. Thomas said his speech set the tone for many of the discussions among CEOs.
