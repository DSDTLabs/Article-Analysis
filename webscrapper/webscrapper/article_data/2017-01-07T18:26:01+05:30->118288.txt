CHENNAI:   has declined to entertain a PIL ( ) which accused vice-chancellor of  ,  , of appointing her doctor-husband R Sugumar and doctor-sister S Usha as members of top academic bodies, and purchasing high-end cars against the rules.

 Filed by Varaaki, the PIL sought a direction from the governor-chancellor to take action against the medical university’s vice-chancellor.
 
 Dismissing the PIL, and rapping the PIL petitioner, the first bench comprising chief justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and justice M Sundar said: “We are completely dissatisfied with the bonafides of this petition. The power of the vice-chancellor, in turn, is checked by various bodies, where agendas are placed and approved. Thus, there is a control and check mechanism provided under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University Act, 1998 itself.”
 
 The petitioner said that he had already sent representations to the government and the governor complaining that the vice-chancellor had purchased a high-end car over and above what had been provided for in the budget, and that she had appointed her husband as member of Standing Academic Board and Faculty of UG Medicine and Surgery of the university, and sister as Standing Academic Board and Faculty of Medicine and Medical Specialties in the university.
 
 Rejecting the PIL, the first bench referred to the complaints to the governor-chancellor and said, “the chancellor would be quite aware of what has been alleged…merely because a person unconnected with the subject matter even wrote letters to the chancellor, it would not give him the right to seek a direction from the court, that the chancellor must act in a particular manner.”
 
 They then dismissed the PIL saying they were not inclined to entertain it. They also referred to the fact that the petitioner had been writing letters to the vice-chancellor levelling allegations against her and threatening her not to continue in the post.
