MUMBAI: Students of   at Chiplun, who had to shoulder the burden of a sudden fee increase, have written to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) and the Fee Regulatory Authority (FRA) that the college has submitted a list of bogus teachers. 

 In its fee hike proposal, the college had informed the FRA that it has 250-odd teachers on its rolls, thus hiking their salary bill and the overall expenditure. Under the guidelines of the Medical Council of India (MCI), the college ought to merely have 132 full-time faculty members. “Students have found that there are merely 41 teachers in the college,” said Dr Vivek Korade, president of the Forum Against Commercialisation of Education. “Some faculty is practising in Goa, someone else is in Nashik,” he added.
 
 DMER head Dr Praveen Singare said that if the students and activists submit evidence, his office would initiate an inquiry into the matter. 
 
 Recently, the Medical Council of India de-registered 38 teachers of a college in southern India where the faculty was not full-time with that medical institute. “We students were shocked at the fee hike of this two-year-old medical college. But now we understand how they have hiked their expenses,” said students. 
 
 The fees were recently hiked to Rs 7.25 lakh from Rs 3.90 lakh last year. Earlier, college authorities had informed parents that the fees would be hiked by 5%-10%, but the hike has been about 86%. College authorities claimed that this is a “difference of fees and not a hike” as the fees of this college were already low compared to other colleges.
 
 BKL Walawalkar Rural Medical College is the only medical institute in Chiplun and the entire Konkan district. Parents and students opt for this two-year-old college because of its low fees, but now with this fee issue parents are in a fix as exams of their wards are approaching.
