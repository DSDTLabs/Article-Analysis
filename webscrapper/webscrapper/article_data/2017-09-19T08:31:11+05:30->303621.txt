INDORE: Despite   being found in   of a school and one month after the   for   of   of food items being served to children in government-run schools under mid-day meal scheme, district food safety department is yet to take any action.

 Only three days ago, a teacher of Government Middle School number-40 in Dhakkanwala Kuan, had spotted worms in the mid-day meal when the food was about to be served to the students. Following the incident, about 200 students of the school had refused to eat mid-day meal. They were ready to eat the food only after the senior officials from zila panchayat assured them of quality of the food.
 
 “Maintaining quality of the food being served under mid-day meal scheme should be priority of the authorities concerned since its main objective is to improve nutritional status of school children,” said a senior administrative official wishing anonymity.
 
 The scheme has remained helpful in increasing the enrolment, retention and attendance of children at government school, and thus, it increases responsibility of the departments concerned for its proper implementation, he added.
 
 However, it seems that the recent incident has also failed to draw attention of the food safety officials. Food safety officer Manish Swami said, “As per the order, the officials are required to do sudden inspection at 10 government-run schools and collect food samples in this month. They will also have to collect samples of mid-day meal from similar number of government schools in the next month.”
