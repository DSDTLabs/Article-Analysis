HYDERABAD: Former Chief Justice of Delhi HC Justice G   said women protection laws will be of no use unless implemented effectively. “Our high courts and the   do not have even 10% of woman judges to ensure implementation of women protection laws,” she said, during a seminar on judicial reforms organised by   on Saturday.

 She stressed that governments and society should not allow crimes on women to go untried. “Increase number of courts, streamline their trials and increase the number of woman judges for delivering justice to women,” she said.
 
 “Women can compete and secure posts in judiciary on their own, but what’s needed is will power to allow them in,” she said, reminding that mere education and financial freedom won’t make women truly free. “They should be allowed to take decisions on various aspects of their lives,” she said.
 
 Future planning, marriage, leading a life of their choice are some of the areas where even well-to-do women are not allowed to take decisions on their own, she said. “Laws and their effective implementation are equally important to achieve gender equality,” Justice Rohini said.
 
 She also reminded how the constitutionally-guaranteed space for women in panchayat raj and municipal institutions are being hijacked by husbands by making elected women representatives mere rubber stamps.
 
 “Women should be allowed to function on their own. Let them take decisions. Let them face the consequences of such decisions with grace,” she said.
 
 Domestic violence, trafficking of women, open atrocities on women are some of the areas that need to be addressed with an iron fist, Justice Rohini,who is currently heading the All-India   as its chairperson, said.
