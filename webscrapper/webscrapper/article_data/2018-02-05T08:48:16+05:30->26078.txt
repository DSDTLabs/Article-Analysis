INDORE: Railways has planned to run an   DEMU train between   and Ratlam stations.

 The divisional railway manager of Ratlam division on Sunday said that they were expecting to receive rake of a DEMU train, which is being run on Ratlam and Mathura rail section. “The rake is expected to be freed from the Ratlam-Mathura section in the second week of February. We have requested for the rake to run an extra   between Indore and Ratlam railway stations,” said divisional railway manager RN Sunkar.
 
 The DRM said the plan is to fulfil the demand of passengers for an additional DEMU train service between Indore and Ratlam during early morning and late in the evening. 
 
 Sunkar had come to Indore to inspect the railway station. “We are also planning to set up a stabling line between platform 1 and 2 of the station,” he said, adding that it will be for parking engines and trains with less number of coaches at the station. 
 
 The railways had earlier announced to develop a garden on this vacant space but after finding the need of a stabling line at the station it was changed.
 
 Sunkar also issued instructions to officials concerned to start escalator facility at the station at the earliest. “Indore has always been the most important station of the division, and efforts are being made for provision of best class passenger amenities at the station,” he said. 
 
 Officials are also identifying areas, which are not in use, on the station’s premises. “The vacant space will be identified and developed in a manner so that they can be utilised for passengers’ interest,” he said. 
 
 Speaking about expansion of Dr Ambedkar Nagar railway station, the DRM said that they were waiting for land acquisition process. “The expansion project would be executed as soon as we get the land,” he said.
