MUZAFFARNAGAR: For over a year, 25-year-old Aas   did extra shifts as carpenter to save money for his marriage. On Sunday morning, the day of his wedding, the entire Babri village of Shamli district was all decked up, and his house was buzzing with relatives. All of them were fervently waiting for Aas to turn up, so that the ‘baarat’ (marriage procession) could proceed to the bride’s house.
 
  But, as the local orchestra was reaching a crescendo, Aas was allegedly being tortured nearby by some unknown men. A few hours later, his body was found hanging from a tree in a mango orchard, on the outskirts of Babri village.
  
  Soon, a police team rushed to the spot and sent the Aas’s body for post mortem examination. A police officer said that there were marks of torture on his body and his wrists were also slit with some sharp-edged object. His body was hung from a thin electric wire which had also left a deep cut mark on his throat.
  
  Police said that they have registered a case of murder against unknown persons and launched a probe. They also said that post mortem examination report will put some more light on the cause of the death.
  
  A carpenter by profession, Aas’s marriage was fixed in Dadheru village of   district. “We all are shocked,” said  , his brother.
  
  Superintendent of police (SP)   told TOI: “A case has been registered on behalf of the family’s complaint. An investigation is on and we will find the reason for his death soon.”
