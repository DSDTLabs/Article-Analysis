Vijayawada: Contract assistant professors have urged the state government to resolve their grievancess before conducting the   for the post of assistant professors in various universities across Andhra Pradesh. The minister for HRD Ganta Srinivasa Rao announced the dates for the screening test through AP Public Service Commission (APPSC) on March 21. 

 The exam will be held from April 9 to 13. The hall tickets for the candidates will be available online from April 3. The screening test will not be held for those universities, which have got stay orders from the court. About 1,109 posts will be filled up through the exam.
 
  Ganta Srinivasa Rao said the decision was taken because of the irregularities in the process of filling posts at the universities. He added that the government does not want to intervene in the autonomy of the universities and the screening test is being conducted only to make the recruitment process more transparent. Contract assistant professors, who have been working at the universities for years, are now unsure about their future. 
 
 Malli Bhaskar, secretary for state university contract assistant professors association, said, “The committee, which was formed to resolve the issues of the contract assistant professors about a month ago, is yet to deliver its report, but the government is going ahead with the screening tests. The government has not given us any guarantee on the security of our jobs.”
 
 Bhaskar said there are about 1,567 contract assistant professors working at 14 universities. Some of those jobs will be as risk because of the screening test, he said. “The government wants contract employees to compete with graduated students. This is not fair. Moreover, the exam is against SC rule,” he said.
