Panaji:The North Goa district magistrate on Tuesday issued an order extending the ban imposed on Sri Ram Sene chief Pramod Muthalik by 60 days, effective from May 15, 2018, stating his speeches could provoke violence. The order also bans the entry of any of his associates. “The step has been taken due to their aggressive speeches that could hurt the sentiments of certain groups and instigate violence, thus adversely affecting public peace and tranquility,” stated the order issued by North Goa district magistrate Nila Mohanan.  The ban on Muthalik’s entry into Goa has been in force since 2014. In March, Hindu Janjagruti Samiti (HJS) had demanded that the government withdraw the ban in view of Muthalik’s acquittal in the Mangaluru pub attack case.
