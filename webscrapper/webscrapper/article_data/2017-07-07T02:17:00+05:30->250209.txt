MUMBAI: The Bombay high   on Thursday directed the BMC to place before it a record in respect of a girl child of an unwed mother who has moved the court to remove the biological father’s name.

 The 22-year-old not only wants the correction in the birth record of her daughter but also to change her status to “unmarried”. Her petition said she delivered a girl in November 2014 and the application for registration of birth of the child recorded her as “married”. The judges questioned if the biological father’s name can be deleted from the birth certificate.
 
 Her advocate relied on a Supreme Court judgment, which said birth certificates should be issued to children of single parents or unwed mothers on the basis of an affidavit filed by them. He said his client had filed such an affidavit and requested a correction in the birth records of her daughter but it was rejected by the BMC health officer.
 
 BMC’s advocate said health officers who register births and deaths have no power to change or make corrections in birth records without a court order. Adjourning the hearing, the judges specifically sought the original application form filled by her for getting her daughter’s birth registered.
