Calangute: The Calangute panchayat gram sabha ended on a chaotic note after villagers demanded that it be adjourned as the panchayat secretary was absent and a stand-in secretary was deputed by the BDO. The gram sabha also saw heated arguments between villagers over the ‘fixed’ agenda of the meeting, as they were not allowed to raise any issues other than those already fixed.

 Villagers also pointed out that a resolution had been adopted that no gram sabhas were to be held on the first Sunday of the month as it clashes with a Church meeting. 
 
 Sarpanch Anthony Menezes conceded and adjourned the gram sabha to a yet-to-be-decided future date. Menezes had earlier announced that he would be stepping down as sarpanch in June due to ‘personal reasons’.
