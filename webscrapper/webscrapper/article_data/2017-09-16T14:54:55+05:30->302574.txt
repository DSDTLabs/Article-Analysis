CHANDIGARH: To benefit state farmers, Punjab may soon have some new laws such as the moneylender’s act, the higher agricultural education act, an act on laying of underground pipelines and the livestock feed act.

 Punjab State Farmers Commission chairman   said this at a seminar on ‘Agribusiness potential of Punjab state’ jointly organised by Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), Sector 19, Chandigarh and the Indian Society of Agriculture Marketing (ISAM), Hyderabad.
 
 Jakhar said the commission has already made its contributions towards abolishing of truck unions in Punjab which were a bane for the farmers of the state. The commission was also working towards amending certain Acts and proposing some new ones, he said.
 
 Professor  , department of sociology and social anthropology, Punjabi University, Patiala, said market forces and industry have always exploited farmers and the expansion of the current development model is nothing less than market terrorism which needs to be controlled and regulated.
 
 “Both Punjab and   in some sense would always be at a disadvantage owing to the Union government’s focus on food inflation and food security. Hence promoting agribusiness, where needs of all stakeholders are addressed, is need of the hour. The commission, as its responsibility and work ethic, aims to increase the prosperity, jobs and quality of life of all those who are the prime focus of its vision, the farmers including agricultural labourers,” said the commission chairman.
 
 Three technical sessions were held on themes of innovative agribusiness models, value addition and entrepreneurship in agribusiness and high value crops in agribusiness.
