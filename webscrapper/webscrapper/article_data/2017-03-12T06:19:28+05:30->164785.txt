BENGALURU: Shivaram Reddy didn't only target women staying in PG accommodations or walking on the street. He also victimized minor boys, particularly school-going ones, suspect police. 

  Reddy was shot at by police on Outer Ring Road, Marathahalli last week, and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. On searching his house in Avalahalli, Old Madras Road, police stumbled upon sex books and old paper cuttings with pictures of gay sex activists. The room had posters of Telugu film and serial actresses, and paper cuttings of male child actors. 
 
 "We'll probe into the matter. Locals recall Reddy loitering near schools in the evenings," cops said.
