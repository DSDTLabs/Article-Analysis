THANE: To bring people back to nature and keep them away from technology, environment experts have begun setting up digital detoxification sessions for the tech-addicted populace. The groups are roping in citizens from across MMR to join this drive where they will cut ties with gadgets and participate in nature trails, clean-up sessions and interactive games.

 Bilwada Kale, an environmentalist associated with BNHS, said, “We are addicted to the web world and don’t realize the stress, sleep disorders and other issues that accompany it. To break this unhealthy chain, we decide to start this digital detoxification session at our Goregaon-based Conservation Education Centre. Participants will have to submit their phones and other gadgets on entering the premises. Then they participate in activities ranging from nature trails and clean-up drives, to playing indoor environmental games and connecting with people instead of chatting on mobile applications and social media.”
 
 Sangita Joshi, an active member of Paryavaran Dakshata Manch, said, “Even during nature trails, people click pictures and selfies in the forest to upload on social media. Do they really enjoy the beauty of nature? It’s high time they took at least a day’s break from the tech world.”
 
 “Children don’t have the opportunity to play anymore because of their hectic school-classes-extracurricular activities schedule. As they grow older, their work piles up, time is never enough, and this hectic life adds to the stress, resulting in health ailments. By taking a break from this chaos once in a while and spending a day with nature, they could find a way out of this unhealthy chain,” said Anjana Dewasthale, a city-based horticulturist.
