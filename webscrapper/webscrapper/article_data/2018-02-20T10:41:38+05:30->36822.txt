TRICHY: After achieving a desirable response from residents to   at source, the   has launched   drive through street plays, targeting traders to segregate waste at source each day before handing it out to sanitary workers. The street plays involving traditional musical instruments kicked off at the corporation on Monday and would involve distribution of awareness pamphlets to traders to identify biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste materials.

 Corporation officials said the concept of segregating   at source even before handing out to sanitary workers has been auguring well among the residents. However, it is said that traders irrespective of their scale of operation are yet to accustom to the segregated waste collection activity. To rope in their responsibility to promote solid waste management (SWM) practice and as a part of capacity building initiative, the urban local body launched street plays which would reach out to the doorsteps of all commercial establishments in four zones seeking support to source segregation of waste.
 
 “Before extensively penalising the non-cooperative public for segregated waste collection, we planned to create awareness exclusively for the traders. Of late, akin to the cost-free dustbins provided to residential localities, we even gave away more than 100 dustbins free of cost to traders to promote segregated waste collection,” an official source with the civic body said.
 
 As of now, sanitary workers with the civic body are collecting the waste from commercial establishments from the afternoon till evening. Since traders are alleging slackness in waste collection, the street plays which would also have sanitary officials are touted to serve as a platform for the civic body to understand and address the lapses in waste collection.
