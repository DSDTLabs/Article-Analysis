 maestro A R   on Friday dedicated a song to the victims of race attacks during his concert in Sharjah. 

 Before performing the track from   starrer 'Swades', the Oscar-winning composer lamented the racial hatred which is affecting people around the world. 
 
 "In this movie, a successful engineer wants to return to India to do something for the nation. Nowadays, people are also looking to return but for a different reason. And the reason is racism," Rahman said. 
 
  cinema's new sensation Dulquer Salmaan was among the audience and also took to the stage to praise the music director during the concert. 
 
 "One of my greatest honours has been to feature in a song composed by Rahman sir. He is a legend and there isn't a genre he hasn't cracked," he said. 
 
  
  
 Rahman started the concert with some soulful numbers including 'Naadaan Parindey' from 'Rockstar' and even the first Malayalam song he had composed. 
 
 Singers Karthik, Neeti Mohan and Benny Dayal also sang during the concert. "Wish the whole world made more friends than enemies," Rahman concluded the gig.
