NEW DELHI: The   flew as many as 11,000 sorties during the just-concluded massive  , which saw the force testing its war-fighting drills on both the western front with Pakistan and northern one with China, with even CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) attack scenarios coming into play.

 
 “Of the 11,000 sorties during the pan-India exercise from April 8-22, around 9,000 were of fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Mirage-2000s,  , MiG-29s, MiG-21s, MiG-27s,   and the Hawk advanced jet trainers (in a combat support role),” said an officer on Tuesday.
 
 Six of the eight indigenous Tejas that took part did develop some snags the first day, much like some other fighters, but were rectified within six hours to carry out the task of air defence and ground attack assigned to them.
 
 “Tejas was able to match other fighters with six sorties each day. Overall, we ensured 80% serviceability (operational availability) of different aircraft during the exercise, with 97% for radars and missile systems. During actual war, we would also take calculated risks to generate even more sorties,” said the officer.
 
 As earlier reported by TOI, the first phase of the high-voltage exercise saw a staggering 5,000 sorties by fighters during a three-day “surge” in air combat operations on the western front, with the IAF then switching its forces in 48 hours to the northern borders with China from   to Arunachal.
 
 The aim of the exercise, which also witnessed activation of civil airfields, was to validate the IAF’s full spectrum capability, with real time coordination, deployment and employment of air power in a short and intense battle scenario.
