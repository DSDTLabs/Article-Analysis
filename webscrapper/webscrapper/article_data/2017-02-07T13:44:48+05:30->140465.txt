QUEPEM: Illegal extraction of laterite stones for many days at a site on the   river bank at Sulcorna has ravaged the green area and the rejected matter dumped in the river is polluting the water body. Villagers allege that the rampant extraction activity is in full swing, with the contractors taking advantage of the government officials’ engagement in election duty. 

 An area of about 1,300 sq m has been excavated and quarried for stones. “The rejection from what’s dug up has been dumped in the river by using machinery, thus polluting the river water,” a villager said, adding that, “Villagers in upstream areas use the water for drinking, washing clothes and bathing”. 
 
 Local resident   filed a complaint with the   panchayat, director of mines and   mamlatdar.
 
 A panchayat team headed by sarpanch Tolio Gaonkar with panch members Dilip Desai, Ravindra Velip and other officials conducted a site inspection on December 17, 2016, where they caught workers red-handed at the site—survey no 36/3 of Sulcorna.
 
 “The river is being polluted by dumping the mud from extraction,” an official said. Neither has the panchayat nor the directorate of mines and geology issued any approval for stone quarrying activity, sources said.
 
 The panchayat inspection report, which states that the illegal activity poses a threat to the environment, and also domestic and wild animals, has been submitted to the director of mines and geology, Panaji, deputy collector, Quepem and police inspector at Quepem police station.
 
 “Villagers are upset that the activity continues despite the submission of the inspection report. Officials in the deputy collector’s office in Quepem informed that the election process is keeping them busy.
 
 Gaonkar confirmed that he had sent the inspection report to the authorities. “We will take action against the accused within four days, if the mines department or the deputy collector fail to act,” he said.
