GURUGRAM: March is likely to end on a hotter note as the mercury is expected to rise to 37 degrees Celsius next week due to clear skies and dry winds.

 On Saturday, the maximum   was 32 degrees Celsius and the minimum was 18. On Sunday, the mercury is likely to rise by one notch and on Monday, it will rise one notch again. 
 
 According to the   (RWFC) officials, the temperature is likely to increase sharply next week as the western disturbance last week dissipated after light rainfall, paving the way for clear skies. “Next week, the mercury is going to rise steadily,” an RWFC official said, adding, “We are expecting temperature to reach 37 degrees Celsius on Thursday. For the rest of the week, the mercury will go back and forth between 34 and 36 degrees Celsius.”
 
 Officials said no fresh western disturbance was headed into the region. “After the previous western disturbance struck the region, the skies have been mostly clear,” an official said. 
 
 The official added, “The region has been witnessing a warm trend since the last week of February. From the perspective of climatology, it is natural that temperature would rise but as per our observation, the days have been 3-4 degrees warmer than usual since February-end. That is because we did not have any significant rainfall activity this winter season.”
 
 Last month, IMD had predicted the weather in the plains this year would be hotter than in 2017. Officials have blamed this on scant rainfall but they have not ruled out the effects of climate change. “We cannot decisively say it is due to climate change because such a claim requires data analysis of several decades but definitely climate change effects are showing up.”
