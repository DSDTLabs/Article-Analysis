HYDERABAD: The   leaders led by president N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Monday requested governor ESL Narasimhan to direct the state government and Assembly Speaker to comply with the   order and reinstate   Komatireddy   and SA Sampath Kumar.

 Stating that the two MLAs were expelled from the Assembly by “an illegal and unconstitutional resolution” due to “an erroneous view of fact and law” on March 13, the   delegation demanded that their posts be restored “upholding the rule of law and the judgment of High Court in true letter and spirit.”
 
 
 “Though 20 days have passed from the date of the judgement, neither the state government nor the Assembly has preferred to make any appeal against it, resulting in the judgement of the single judge attaining finality,” Uttam said.
 
 
 The single judge had held that the expulsion is set aside and the petitioners’ membership in the Assembly automatically restored. “But the Assembly website is still not showing our members as MLAs and the privileges have not been extended to them,” he said.
 
 
 Citing Article 12 and 154 of the Constitution, Uttam said the governor is empowered to direct the State/Assembly to implement the HC order. Meanwhile, another delegation submitted a separate memorandum to chief secretary SK Joshi on the issue.
