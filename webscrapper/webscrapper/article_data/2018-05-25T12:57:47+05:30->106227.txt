SECUNDERABAD: It appears time has come to play English singer and composer  's famous song "Breaking down the barriers" in   as barriers/road blocks (read walls) continue to greet residents and harried commuters in some of the areas and internal roads. Surprisingly, despite a clear-cut instruction from the ministry of defence (MoD) to remove all barriers/checkposts and keep all the public roads open, the   ( ) is taking its own sweet time. 

 
 In the official communication issued on May 21 and circulated on Thursday, the MoD clearly said that all the barriers and checkposts must be removed forthwith and sentries patrolling the checkposts or manning them must behave politely with civilians. Ironically, four days later, barriers have not been removed in some of the areas. For instance, Allahabad Gate and Wellington Road Gate have barriers still in place. 
 
 Another major point which the MoD highlighted in its order to LMA was that traffic should be monitored by sentries on all the opened roads for 30 days at entry and exit points and also record the traffic flow on video so that a comprehensive data could be prepared. 
 
 "The   is yet to share the orders issued by the MoD on reopening of the roads in the Cantonment jurisdiction," vice-president, SCB, J Ramakrishna told TOI. "I will call on GOC, Telangana Andhra Sub-Area soon and discuss the issue in detail," he said. His claim comes in the wake of 14 roads out of 25 public roads still shut even as air of uncertainty prevails among lakhs of residents. 
 
 In its order, the MoD said: "All the opened roads can be reviewed based on the provisions of section 258 of Cantonments Act-2006." It also said presidents of Cantonment Boards should talk to the concerned military authorities on the closure of the roads and sort it out. 
 
 Meanwhile, in some of the areas, sentries continued to insist on ID proofs and documents from commuters before allowing them through some of the roads that have been opened.
