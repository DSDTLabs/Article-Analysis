NEW DELHI: A man who sexually exploited his live-in partner and even married her after she lodged a rape case, will be prosecuted for the crime.

 The Delhi high court has refused to settle a rape case where the woman wanted to withdraw the charges after she married the accused in an Arya Samaj wedding.
 
 Justice R K Gauba made it clear that extraordinary powers of HC can’t be used to quash criminal cases where a woman has alleged she was cheated and sexually exploited, even if she later wants to compromise the case.
 
 “But, in a case where allegations of rape, physical assault and criminal intimidation have been levelled, it cannot be said that the case is one of family dispute or one arising out of matrimonial relationship or is civil in nature. The FIR may have been registered only under the label of Section 376 IPC but the allegations made therein seem to indicate commission of other offences as well,” the court observed, saying criminal prosecution against the accused male live-in partner will continue.
 
 The case relates to an FIR for alleged rape lodged by the woman in   last year where she complained that she was subjected to sexual exploitation on the pretext of future marriage. She alleged that the accused persuaded her to shift with him in a live-in relationship after proposing marriage.
 
 While she awaited the marriage dates to be announced, the accused Rupesh had repeated sex with her on the promise of marriage during that period, the FIR alleged. The complainant also said she was subjected to physical assault causing physical violence resulting in hurt and certain acts of commission constituting offence of criminal intimidation.
