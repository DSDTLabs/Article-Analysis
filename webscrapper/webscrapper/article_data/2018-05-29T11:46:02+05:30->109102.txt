HYDERABAD:   national secretary   said that though CM   and AP CM Chandrababu Naidu had appealed to Telugu-speaking voters not to vote for BJP in the   elections, voters rejected their appeal and supported the BJP. According to him, BJP bagged seats in constituencies such as Yelahanka, Bommanahalli, Mahdevapura where a huge number of Telugu-speaking people from Nellore, Chittoor and the two Godavari districts are settled. “Even in Chitradurga, BJP secured five out of six seats and in Rayadurg district, we bagged two seats and opened our account there,” Rao said.

 
 Addressing the party state executive meeting on Monday, Rao said though the party was short of some seats, the number of seats it bagged rose from 40 to 104, with the vote percentage being 36.5. “This shows that PM Narendra Modi’s popularity is on the rise while that of the   and JD-S is on the decline. Against the people’s verdict and wish, JD-S and Congress have formed the government in Karnataka,” he said.
 
 BJP state president K   alleged   had been running family rule in the state and his federal front is “family front”. He said the ruling TRS government has not kept its promises like one government job to each household in the state. About Congress, he said that people were fed up with the party and it cannot come to power even if its members took up yatras and programmes.
 
 Laxman urged the leaders to get ready for panchayat elections to be held in July.
