KHAGARIA: Despite the government’s tall claims of improving healthcare facilities in the state, several primary health centres (PHCs) and additional primary health centres (APHCs) in   district are running without a permanent building.

 Sources said these health centres are being run from panchayat bhawans, rented buildings and government buildings meant for other purposes. The district administration has even failed to provide land for at least 10 APHCs at Mohraghat, Sumbha, Sonebarsa, Thutthi, Mohanpur Malpa, Basua, Kolebara, Madhopur, Balha Bazar and Bhadas villages of the district.
 
 Similarly, around 60 PHCs, including seven under Alouli block, three each under Beldaur block, 15 under Chautham block, 13 under Khagaria block, nine under Gogri block and 10 under Parbatta block are yet to be allotted land.
 
 Civil surgeon Arun Kumar Sinha said the state health department has been requested to allot land for the health centres. “We expect a positive response from the government,” he added.
