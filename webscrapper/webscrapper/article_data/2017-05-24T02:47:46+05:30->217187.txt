LUCKNOW: A day after he was sentenced for his alleged role in the   scam that took place during the   government, then coal secretary H C Gupta told   on Tuesday that a government must protect its honest officials. A CBI court had convicted the retired   officer on Friday for alleged irregularities in the allotment of coal blocks in 2008. “The government should see officers’ conduct and service, and protect the honest ones,” he said, adding that it was the responsibility of the government to ensure no honest officer faced such a situation in the future as it would send a wrong message to the cadre. 

 On his conviction, Gupta said, “What shall I say about myself ? I am what I was before the judgment and after it. All of you know me and my colleagues know how I have worked.”
 
 The huge outpouring of support from the IAS fraternity gives him a sense of satisfaction even in these trying times, the 1971-batch UP cadre officer said.
 
 Even before his conviction, when he was charge-sheeted a few months ago, his colleagues took to the print and social media, vouching for his honesty and impeccable service record. They went to the extent of calling upon the government to correct his “honest mistakes”. 
 
 D K Mittal, another retired officer of the UP cadre, said that “if Gupta has to go to jail, then all of should not be here and be in jail”. 
 
 During the trial, the IAS Officers’ Association raised the issue of culpability in decision making. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that genuine errors in commercial decision-making must be decriminalised. “Penalising bureaucrats will create a policy paralysis if there’s jail term awaiting them for a decision gone wrong,” he said. The CBI, probing the Coalgate scam, had not charged Gupta, but when the court intervened and directed it to investigate his case, the agency filed a chargesheet, leading to his conviction for two years.
