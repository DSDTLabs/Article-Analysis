CHENNAI: After 21 years, Chennai Open has left the city and found a new home in Pune. Though the   ( ) had renewed its contract with organizers   after the 2017 event for another three years, the company terminated it as the tournament was without a title sponsor.

 The move irked TNTA and they said that they will ‘consult its legal counsel and take appropriate action’ in an official press release. But when asked, TNTA secretary general CBN Reddy said that they would like to put this behind and look ahead.
 
 “Chennai Open has been an integral part of the lives of tennis lovers in the city for 21 years. I look at it as a very successful marriage. But now that it is officially moving out we bear no malice towards anybody. We send our best wishes to the new tournament too. What’s done is done. Now it is time to look to the future,” said CBN Reddy.
 
 “It is not the time to sit and rue what is gone. Instead we will have to think what tournaments we can bring to Chennai next. We are planning to bring the Challengers 1500 to Chennai and a couple of other tournaments. We are also planning to bid for the next home   match. So we will find a way to quench the thirst of tennis lovers in the city,” he added.
 
 Things began to go downhill for Chennai Open after they lost their title sponsors Aircel, who were merging their telecom operations with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Company. TNTA told IMGR to look for a new title sponsor for next year and TNTA would raise the remaining fund with help from the government. “But instead IMGR terminated the contract and it was reported that they were looking to take the ATP 250 tournament out of the country before settling for Pune as the venue,” a TNTA source said.
