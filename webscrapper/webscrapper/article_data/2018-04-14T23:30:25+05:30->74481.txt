NEW DELHI: A major showdown is looming in the   ( ) with an election being held for the first time in 52 years for the post of president in what is being seen as a move to end its longstanding leader Pravin Togadia’s effective control of the Sangh affiliate.

 
 The election will be held in Gurgaon on April 14 and will end what is seen as the unfinished agenda of December 29 last year when VHP members met in Bhubaneswar to elect the president. The plan did not go through as differences cropped up among rival factions.
 
 Vishnu Sadashiv Kokje, ex-Himachal Pradesh governor who is also a former MP high court judge, is challenging incumbent president Raghav Reddy, who is seen as close to Togadia. 
 
 A section of the saffron camp, including the   top brass, has been upset at the VHP over Togadia’s frequent sniping at the government, particularly his criticism of PM  . 
 
 “We have completed the formalities for the election. V S Kokje and Raghav Reddy are the two candidates for the post of president,” Surendra Jain, joint general secretary of VHP, said. 
 
 “Our first effort was to reach consensus but when it didn’t happen we are holding the election,” Jain said. He said VHP was following a democratic process, which was a healthy practice. 
 
 The outcome will have a bearing on the VHP’s structure, including the fate of Togadia who is international working president and has been one of the most visible faces of the organisation for decades. Reddy has nominated Togadia to the key position and the two leaders will be united to safeguard their hegemony in the organisation.
 
 Reacting to the election, Togadia pledged his support to Reddy and said the latter and his family were dedicated to the cause of Hindutva whereas Kokje was never involved in any VHP activity.
 
 He added that he would continue as working president if Reddy won, otherwise he would resign.
