IMPHAL/MUMBAI: A man who had vanished from   40 years ago was traced in Mumbai, all thanks to a video of him singing an old Hindi film song that was uploaded on   by a fashion designer. 

 Khomdram Gambhir Singh (65) left his Imphal home in 1978, and his family members had not heard of him since. That was till his video was brought to their attention on Friday. 
 
 When TOI visited Gambhir’s ancestral home on Monday, his family said they are eagerly awaiting his return. Themthing Ngashangva, SSP, Imphal West, said they have already contacted   police. “Tomorrow we will send two personnel to Mumbai to bring him back,” said Ngashangva. 
 
 Bandra police said Imphal cops sent them a photograph of a young Singh for identification. “We sent teams to Bandra police station to identify this man from his photo. Our constables found him at Bandra railway station and brought him here. We sent his photos to Imphal police and they, in turn, showed them to his family,” said Pandit Thakaray, senior inspector, Bandra police. 
 
 Imphal West Students Club secretary Atom Samarendra and another member said one Aheibam Dinamani told them about the clip. “We approached Gambir’s brother Kullachandra,” said Samarendra. “On seeing the video, I could not stop crying. We truly thank Firoze Sakir for uploading my brother’s video,” he said. The video was uploaded on October 17, 2017. Sakir told TOI Gambhir ekes out a living by doing odd jobs and he also sings.
