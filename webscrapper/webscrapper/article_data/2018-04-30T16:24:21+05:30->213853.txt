 Experimenting with gowns, saris, couture, the Former Miss World made all her fashion and beauty looks, worth noticing, especially at Cannes' red carpet. Whether she wears a sari or a gown, the beauty queen will always be scrutinized meticulously and she has no fear in experimenting at all. 
 
 With every year, the fans and even haters just waited to see how Aishwarya would stun this time and last year she did surprise everyone with her bold purple lips. She wore a detailed floral gown by Rami Kadi and teamed it up with a purple lipstick.
