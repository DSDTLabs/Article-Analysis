BENGALURU: The high court’s Dharwad bench has directed the   to probe the case of a missing four-day-old girl in Bagalkot, stating that local police and a nursing home had colluded to claim the infant had died and the body was sent to a biomedical waste facility.

 A division bench of Justices S Sujatha and Prabhakara Shastry gave the direction while disposing of a habeas corpus petition filed by the mother,   Pujar, 36, who’s a fruit vendor. Shankramma is from Rakkasagi village,   taluk, Bagalkot district. “State police appear to have not conducted the investigation entrusted to them properly,” the bench noted, citing several inconsistencies in the statements recorded and missing links in the evidence produced before the court. The audio in some of the five compact discs, submitted to the court by the assistant superintendent of police along with his report, is not clear and there’s no continuity in the recording of the inquiry done by a woman police constable.
 
  Shankramma had sought for a direction to the authorities to produce her missing girl child. She had delivered the baby at   and Multi-specialty Hospital in  , Hungund taluk, on November 9, 2016.
 
 According to Shankramma, Dr Sunitha Arun Kathari had issued the birth certificate and she had cleared the hospital bill of Rs 13,500 to the said doctor. She said her husband Veeresh B Madari and two of his women relatives had assaulted her on November 13, 2016, and when she was discharged from the nursing home on November 14, 2016, the hospital authorities did not hand over the child to her.
 
 Shankramma said while the hospital didn’t respond to her pleas to return the child, Hungund and Ilkal police refused to register complaint. Ilkal police allegedly created a false complaint in her name and forcibly took her signature on a statement which stated the infant had died and the matter was settled between the parties.
