Visakhapatnam: City cops have arrested a builder and his wife on the charge of cheating a nationalised bank to the tune of Rs 67.14 lakh. 

 The Maharanipeta police station cops arrested Mallakanti Malyadri (42), managing partner of M/s MM Constructions, and his business partner and wife M Suhasini (34) on Thursday. Malyadri is said to have cheated various banks to the tune of 21.75 crore in total. 
 
 Nitin Gulati, DCP (law and order) of the city, told media persons here on Thursday that the builder and his wife approached the Bank of Indiaâ€™s Suryabagh branch and obtained a loan of Rs 50 lakh by mortgaging a vacant land of 606.66 sq yards at Madhurawada in March 2013. The couple later obtained another loan of Rs 33.75 lakh from the same bank and purchased four Scorpio vehicles with the same documents in March 2014. 
 
 For both the loans, the accused produced a fake memorandum of deposit of title deed bearing the number 2186/2014 in the Bank of India. The accused also produced fake registration certificates for the four vehicles, the DCP said.
 
 The DCP said on verification of the records by the bank, it was found that Malyadri sold the said mortgaged property to another company MM Foundations and Constructions Private Limited in which he was MD and his wife was director. He then availed another loan of Rs 5 crore from Central Bank of India at Saligrampuram.
