KOLKATA: Apt use of technology ­ from CCTV footage being shared on   platforms to monitoring dump calls of a particular area -helped Port division bust a gang of bike thieves and recover several two-wheelers.

 The lead came from a privately-installed camera near the place of occurrence of a recent two-wheeler theft in Garden Reach. The footage, however, was not clear. After it was sent via Whatsapp to all police stations, one of the officers felt that the culprit could be one “Chicken Raju“, a two-wheeler thief who had served a sentence of two ye ars after he was found guilty of a series of thefts in 2012.
 
 Probe revealed that Raju had settled in his ancestral place in   in 2015 and was not involved in the recent cases. Police then turned lens on  , who had been a close associate of Raju for years and had served sentence with him only . That he had not been staying at his Garden Reach home for months only reinforced the suspicion. “Shamim was finally arrested on Wednesday from a hideout and five motorcycles were also recovered,“ said joint CP (crim)  .
 
 “We have about a thousand CCTV cameras at important junctions of the city . About 1500 more have recently been installed to keep an eye on isolated areas,“ he said.
