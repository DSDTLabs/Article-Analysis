Nagpur: Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) has decided to revise   (DP) of city using the geographical information system (GIS). Target is to bring revised DP in effect from 2020.

 NMC standing committee on Tuesday approved the town planning department’s proposal to appoint Pune-based Monarch Surveyors and Engineering Consultants Pvt Ltd for preparing the draft of revised DP. The civic body will pay Rs18.22 crore for the work.
 
 Chairman Sandip Jadhav said Monarch will have to prepare the draft of revised DP based on GIS technology and also develop georeferencing land records system. “Monarch will take aerial pictures of city spread over 22,700 hectares using drones. Monarch has to submit draft of revised DP within a year,” he said.
 
 City’s existing DP came into effect in 2000 and is valid for 20 years. It is mandatory for NMC to introduce revised DP in 2020. After getting draft of revised DP, NMC will invite suggestions and objections and submit the plan to state government for approval. Revised DP will be prepared for systematic development of the city for next 20 years. At present, DP is available in sheets, making it very difficult to know land use pattern, reservations, zones etc. With georeferencing land records system, revised DP will be accessible at the click of mouse and also be available for architects, town planners and citizens.
 
 The standing committee also kept pending the proposal to shift giant pipeline on RPTS road following TOI report. The water works department had proposed to shift pipeline by spending over Rs1 crore following demand from owner of two residential open plots for clearing entrance of the plots. The department said pipeline needed to be shifted for clearing footpath. The department also did not fix responsibility on officers for the wrongly laid pipeline.
 
 Jadhav said proposal was put on hold to find out reasons how the pipeline was laid on footpath. “Also, official from water works department was not present in the meeting. It will be decided upon in next meeting,” he said.
 
 The committee directed the town planning department to re-tender work for preparing town planning schemes (TPS) of Chinchbhuvan, Hudkeshwar and Narsala. This will delay TPS process. Proposal is to develop Chinchbhuvan under Smart City Mission’s greenfield area development scheme. TPS of Hudkeshwar and Narsala are being prepared as these areas were recently added into city limits.
 
 Proposal to conduct Swachh Wards contest was also approved. Deputy municipal commissioner Jayant Dandegaonkar said All India Institute of Local Self-Government will conduct survey on 12 parameters of all 38 wards by February 28. “Cash prizes and certificates will be given to first three wards. It is being conducted as per Swachh Bharat Mission guidelines,” he said.
 
 Standing committee also approved the proposal to appoint Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC) to prepare detailed project report (DPR) for implementation of Parking Policy. UMTC will have to submit the DPR within six months. NMC will introduce pay and park on all major roads with Parking Policy’s implementation.
