CHANDIGARH: Alleging that Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s relative is heading the consortium collecting ‘goonda tax’ (protection money) from transporters at the   refinery, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday asked the state government to arrest the guilty within 24 hours.

 SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema alleged in a statement   was being collected from transporters at the Bathinda refinery in the form of JST (Jojo Service Tax). He said, “Manpreet Badal tried to play the victim card by stating that he was being vilified but this did not cut any ice with a cabinet colleague who reminded him that his relative was stated to be heading the consortium that was collecting protection money from transporters. The SAD appreciates minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa for setting the record straight and calling a spade a spade.” 
 
 The SAD also alleged people collecting goonda tax call the shots from the finance minister’s residence. “It is a known fact that in Manpreet’s absence, his brother-in-law   calls the shots in the constituency. No local police officer can be expected to take action against him,” alleged the SAD leader. Cheema claimed that the police had failed to take action despite the fact that the largest investor in the area — the Bathinda refinery — had gone on record to give evidence about collection of ‘goonda tax’. The SAD leader demanded an inquiry from a sitting judge of the high court into the entire matter.
 
 Cheema claimed that there were reports that the Bathinda refinery management was having second thought about investing in the proposed petro-chemical project which was to come up along with the refinery. Any such adverse decision on the behalf of the refinery management would sound the death knell for the industrial development of Bathinda, added the former minister.
