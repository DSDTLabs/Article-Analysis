Kolkata: Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd ( ), the organisation engaged in several railway projects in West Bengal, including construction of Metro links in Kolkata, has embarked on a unique move to train and provide employment to youths from backward parts in the state. The first batch of 28 youths — selected by Ramakrishna Math, Naora, from the Bhangar and Canning blocks in South 24 Parganas — left for training at a unit run by L&T Ltd in Hyderabad on Friday. 

 “This is a part of our corporate social responsibility effort. For the last six years, we have ties with Ramakrishna Math, Naora — a branch of Ramakrishna Math, Belur Math — and the Institute for the Handicapped and Backward People (IHBP), Kolkata. Our thrust has been in the fields of health and education and we spend more than Rs 1 crore annually for this. We sustain 300 children at Naora through Ramakrishna Math and an additional 100 with special needs through IHBP,” said Rajesh Prasad, executive director, Metro, RVNL. 
 
 Till now, 105 youths have been selected by the Ramakrishna Math and L&T. All were forced to drop out of schools between Classes V and XII due to financial constraints. In January, the principal and vice principal of L&T’s training unit visited Ramakrishna Math and made the final selection. 
 
 “Under our understanding with Ramakrishna Math, RVNL will bear the travel costs of the youth and also pay Rs 1,000 per month as stipend. They will receive training in Hyderabad for four months. Thereafter, they will be absorbed at L&T project sites as skilled workers. After some time, depending on their performances, their jobs can become permanent. However, the youths won’t be forced to join L&T,” Prasad added. 
 
 Apart from providing free medicines and running a pathological laboratory at Naora, RVNL, which has Tata Institute of Social Sciences and The Energy and Research Institute as its partners, has provided solar lights in interior places of Murshidabad.
