NEW DELHI: The Centre has refuted the allegations before the   that it left   as a medium for the common entrance test for admission to   (NEET) because of its alleged “prejudice and bias” against   and said that there was no consideration of “religion or communal issues” while taking the decision.

 In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the ministry of health and family welfare said the Centre took the decision to allow students to take the exam in one of the ten language — Hindi, English, Gujarati, Marathi, Odiya, Bengali, Tamil, Telegu, Kannada and Assamese — after holding consultations with various state governments. 
 
 It said the proposal to include Urdu as a language to take NEET was made to the Centre after the decision was taken.
 
 The reply was filed after a students’ organisation had earlier told the court that the Centre had deliberately left Urdu as a medium to take NEET as the government was biased against Muslims. 
 
 “It is deliberate and intentional on the part of the health ministry to not include Urdu as a medium for   because of the discriminatory perception of the government functionaries of viewing the language not as a part of cultural heritage and composite culture of India but as a language associated with Muslims against which the government is prejudiced and biased,” Student   had said.
