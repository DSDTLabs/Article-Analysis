This day holds enormous significance in Bengal’s cinematic roster. Though   is no longer amidst us, April 19 will forever bring back his memories, as his famous film — Unishe April — had integrated this date beautifully in its title. At the National Film Awards in 1995, Unishe April was adjudged as the Best Feature Film and   received the Best Actress award. About the embittered relationship between a mother ( ) and her daughter (Debasree), the film was loved by the classes and masses alike. The film also starred   as Aditi aka Debasree’s lover. Now years later, when a fan reminded the mega star about the date, he took to Twitter to write: “He is always there wd us...Thanks for remembering him..” Prosenjit admitted many times that meeting Rituparno changed his life forever. Not only were they great friends, the actor’s house is named after one of Rituparno’s films — Utsab.
