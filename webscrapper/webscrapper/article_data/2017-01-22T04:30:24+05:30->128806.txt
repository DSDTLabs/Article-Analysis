MUMBAI: A day after   president   said his party would contest BMC polls with the NCP, it appears an alliance between the two parties will not see the light of day as the   declared its second list of 31 nominees. 

 "Since NCP has declared the second list, there is no question of an alliance. The   will contest all 227 seats on its own," Nirupam said. He said that at a meeting of the core committee on Friday, a senior Congress leader recommended alliance with the NCP following a request from a senior NCP leader. Accordingly, it was proposed that the Congress leave all the seats NCP had won in 2012 and offer a few more seats to it, he said. 
 
 A week ago, Mumbai NCP president   declared their first list of 45 nominees since Nirupam had declared that the Congress would contest all the seats on its own. On Saturday, Ahir said, "We will contest maximum possible seats."
 
 He said he read about Nirupam's statement on possible alliance, but that there was no official communication to any senior leader of NCP. He further said, "From media reports, it appears the Congress has offered NCP 14 seats it had won in the last elections and a few seats more... We should be given at least 60 seats, then only a discussion is possible,'' Ahir said.
