PANAJI: Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) has started cracking the whip against panchayats and municipal councils for burning the waste in breach of rules, as Corporation of the City of   (CCP) and Penha de Franca were added to the list of offenders.

 Harmful burning of   is rampant all over the state in violation of National   (NGT) and municipal solid waste (MSW) rules 2000. 
 
 Environmental activists allege that the large-scale and unscientific disposal of garbage through this mode has become habitual like a ritual.
 
 Recently, waste was seen being burned at the parade ground behind the garbage sorting site at Campal in the city. In  , dry waste was being incinerated behind the police station. “We have issued notices imposing fines of Rs 25,000 each to these bodies on the weekend,” a GSPCB source said.
 
 In a significant order in December 2016, National Green Tribunal (NGT) had prohibited burning of waste in open places and stipulated a fine of Rs 25,000 on each incident of bulk waste burning.
 
 “For each such incident, violators, including project proponent, concessionaire, any person or body responsible for such burning, shall be liable to pay environmental compensation of Rs 5,000 in case of simple burning, while Rs 25,000 in case of bulk waste burning,” a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar had stated.
 
 Environmentalists in Goa say that out of more than 400 tonnes of garbage generated in the state daily, a large quantum of it is being burnt unchecked. A few citizens have led the way for the board to crack down on self-governing bodies for failing to dispose of waste scientifically.
 
 Last year, Arturo D’Souza’s complaint against burning of waste in  , and recently Panaji citizen, Raj Vaidya’s complaints against Mapusa municipal council fetched these bodies fines for breaching the law.
