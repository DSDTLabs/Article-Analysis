LUCKNOW: For chief minister   , the year 2017 was one for making policies, road maps and blueprints for development in the state and 2018 will test his ability to ensure that they get translated into action.

 Yogi had started with big bang announcements like anti-Romeo squads to check eve-teasing, ban on illegal slaughter houses, surprise visits to police stations and offices, banning spitting and tobacco chewing in government offices etc.
 
 However, the anti-Romeo squads and ban onpan masala in government offices failed to make any impact beyond headlines after a few days. When compared to his predecessors,   has proved to be a hard worker and a hard taskmaster, devoting entire day in planning, supervising and reviewing with officials. On the political front, his work started giving dividends as   won civic elections and Sikandara LS bypoll in Kanpur Dehat. He also campaigned in Gujarat, Kerala, Karnataka and   for BJP. In the last eight months, Aditya   seems to have filled the vacuum in state leadership which the BJP had been looking to fill up for long. However, the challenges and hurdles before the CM won’t melt away in 2018.
 
 Winters are at their peak and the promise to provide sweaters to students is still unfulfilled. Making roads pothole free still remains a headache. From the Rs 20,000crore   project to JPNIC, Gomti Riverfront development and metros in half a dozen cities need his special attention.
 
 Sensing disenchantment among youth, Yogi has announced 2018 as a year dedicated for the empowerment of youth and promised five lakh jobs for them in a year.
 
 The CM has set a goal to bring Rs five lakh crore investment in the state via the two-day investors’ summit in February. The first big test in 2018 will be in February, when the government would present its second budget and make provision for Rs 20,000 crore Poorvanchal Expressway, half a dozen metros and other developmental and social welfare schemes.
