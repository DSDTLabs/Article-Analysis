MUMBAI/THANE:   detained four youths from Diva who were loitering near tracks where a major mishap was averted on Tuesday night.   passengers had a narrow escape as the train halted 30 metres short of hitting a piece of rail kept on the tracks. 

 Police, after questioning them, let them off as they could not find anything incriminating. They have questioned over 50 nearby residents and scrap traders. The cops are scanning records of mobile phones found active for long in the vicinity. Every motorman has been told to stay on high alert. 
 
  general manager D K Sharma has sought the assistance of commuters and directed staff to ensure that suburban tracks from CST to Karjat-Kasara and Panvel are “no-intrusion” zones. Motormen have been instructed to report anything suspicious close to the tracks, sources said. “We need the support of every individual to prevent sabotage or rail rokos in the suburban section,” Sharma said.
