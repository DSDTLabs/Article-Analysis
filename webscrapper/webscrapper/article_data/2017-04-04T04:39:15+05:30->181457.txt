New Delhi: Biking became a passion of   (19) the day he got a 400cc motorcycle. But according to his family, he never indulged in stunt-biking. 

 “He used to be very responsible while riding the bike, and often read articles about maintaining the two-wheeler. It was unlikely that he would race,” said Neeraj, his brother. 
 
 The family said the boy had joined a group of biking enthusiasts who would co-ordinate biking meet-ups via Facebook. Though he never asked them for a sports bike, seeing his enthusiasm, they bought him a bike for Rs 2 lakh last month. 
 
 On Sunday, he had left home around 5.30am with his group members, but didn’t tell his family about it. A few hours after he had left home, police called up to inform that he and two others had been taken to a hospital. 
 
 “When we reached, the locals told us that the other bike was speeding at 120 km/hr when the collision occurred. We want a thorough probe,” said a family friend. 
 
 Neeraj, however, said, “He didn’t know the other bikers; why would he race with them? He had saved a man from dying, and now, he is being accused of racing,” said Neeraj. Raman had finished schooling last year and aspired to be an architect. He had been preparing for entrance exams.
