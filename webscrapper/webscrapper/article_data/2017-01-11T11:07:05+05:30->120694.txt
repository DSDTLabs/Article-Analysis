PATNA: The Bihar government has written to the district magistrates (DMs) to ensure that flags, banners and symbols belonging to different political or other organisations were not displayed in the   to be formed on January 21 in support of prohibition. 

 The human chain is proposed to be the longest ever in the world with over two crore people expected to spread for 11,292km in a chain. The event is aimed at creating awareness about liquor ban imposed in the state since April last year. “This is a social, not a political, cause. Everyone is welcome to join it as a Bihari or an Indian, but not as a representative of any political or apolitical organisation,” an official of the state education department, which is the main organiser of the event, told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 State JD (U) president Bashishtha Narayan Singh had also told his party functionaries on Saturday not to use party flags or banners even as he called upon them to join the human chain to make it a huge success.
 
 As things appeared on Tuesday, non-grand alliance parties seemed to be inclined towards participating in the event. Putting to rest all speculations,   state chief Nityanand Rai on Monday tweeted the party’s support to the government’s initiative.
 
 Earlier, incidentally, ex-state   chief Mangal Pandey and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had refused to commit support to the event, saying the saffron party had not received invite from the organisers.
 
 After his Lok Sanvad programme on Monday, CM   had asked all political parties to join the initiative as it was being organised by the government, not any ruling party, for a social cause. RJD supremo   on Tuesday also asked his party functionaries and workers to make the event a historical moment.
