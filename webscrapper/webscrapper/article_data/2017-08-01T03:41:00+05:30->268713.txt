Porvorim: Agriculture minister Vijai Sardesai told the house on Monday that the government will set up floriculture estates in Goa. “Floriculture estates are non-polluting and less power extensive,” said Sardesai during ‘Question Hour’. Floriculture, Sardesai said, is part of a comprehensive agriculture policy being prepared. Responding to a question tabled by Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar, Sardesai said that at Talegaon in Pune land measuring 1,700ha has been brought under floriculture and that Dutch roses are exported to Netherlands and other European nations. “Such an exercise can also be taken up in Goa,” he said. Opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar, said that the former agriculture minister had claimed that farmers would earn in crores if they take up floriculture, and questioned as to whether the polyhouse scheme had been launched to promote certain companies. Sardesai said that though the existing polyhouse scheme had shown some results, it needed to be modulated to help more farmers. Saying that in horticulture it takes a minimum of three years to show results, Sardesai added, “The scheme ought to have been better coordinated.”  “This could be a good option to offer the youth of Salcete. To stay in Goa and take up floriculture instead of making a passport and going Portugal,” he said. Sardesai said that the government wants to ensure that farmers benefit from brand Goa and that organic farming and horti hubs will be promoted. .
