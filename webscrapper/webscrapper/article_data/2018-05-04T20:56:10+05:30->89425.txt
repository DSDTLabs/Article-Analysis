Actor  , who is part of   Kumar Tewary’s ' ', says that while he loves being part of the show, he found it quite challenging initially. “It wasn't that easy in the initial stage. I was about to fall off from an 800ft mountain, that too on a horse. Then suddenly the horse realized that it was too high for him to jump and I grabbed his neck to stop myself from falling down. 

 From that day fear died in me. We practiced and conquered our inner fears to get into the skins of the unbeatable warriors of Alexander. Now we do it every day...fighting, riding, jumping from horses to swinging swords, the whole experience is amazing. For the injuries, I would like to quote 'where there is a war, there will be blood’,” he says. The actor shares a great bond with his co-actor   as well. “Rohit Purohit as a great co-actor. He is a passionate guy who loves his work a lot and he knows how to keep his crew and cast happy. He knows his character well and also helps us during performances,” he says.
 
 Ask him how he likes working with Siddharth and   and he says, “Siddharth sir is a role model for me. He is a man on a mission and his vision is completely different from the usual. It’s been a great journey for me. I came as a fighter for two days in his previous show and then he saw something in me and asked me to audition for 'Porus'. Being part of the Porus team has been an amazing and a wonderful journey. I am very thankful to all the members of the production house.” The team is currently shooting at Umbergaon. While it’s tough to be away from home,   isn’t complaining. “Umbergaon is our second home. This is like staying in a hotel where everything is taken good care of, from your food, shelter, and standard of life. They make sure that the whole family stays in a healthy working environment without any problems and difficulties,” he says.
