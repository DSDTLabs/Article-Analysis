 This was a new mechanism set up in 2016, over and above the other existing dialogue forums. The decision was taken by   and her Chinese counterpart  , when the latter visited here in August. The first dialogue under that understanding will be held now.
 
 Speaking at the Gateway House geo-economic dialogue in Mumbai on Tuesday, Jaishankar said the government wanted to engage China much more deeply. It was a focus point by the foreign secretary at the recent   as well.
 
 Bilateral ties are in a trough since China decided to remain the outlier on India’s   bid last summer. This was compounded by China’s block on Pakistani terror leader Maulana Masood Azhar. Meanwhile, Beijing’s flagship Belt&Road project,  , is being designed to run through Indian-claimed territory. While India has raised concerns, Beijing has refused to engage India on this. India’s aspirations on the  , too has met the Chinese wall.
 
 In India, there is a growing sense that China wants to thwart India’s global rise even as bilateral trade has prospered. In this backdrop, it has been felt necessary to engage China more closely on a host of other issues, to ensure the relationship does not get bogged down in differences.
