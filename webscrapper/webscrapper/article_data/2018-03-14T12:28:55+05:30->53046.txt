NAGPUR: Most of us would simply enjoy the beauty of the flaming red palash flower which blooms around this time every year. But 63-year-old retired bank employee Satish Ghawekar is going beyond to preserve and revive the trees which bear yellow-coloured flowers too. 

 “Not many know that the palash (Butea Monosperma) also comes in colours other than red or saffron. The yellow colour palash flower which appears white when it is drenched in dew early morning is now rarely seen,” says Ghawekar.
 
 Once while travelling back to Nagpur from Wardha, Ghawekar says he sighted a tree laden with yellow colour flowers. “I stopped to check on it and after inquiring from the local people found out that there were many trees around but most have been destroyed as people hack out the roots and keep them in their pockets for good luck,” he informs. 
 
 The belief is that the goddess of wealth   holds a white colour palash flower in her hands. So, people cut a root from the bottom of the tree on a full moon or no moon night and keep it in the belief that it will increase their wealth. “Since the roots are plucked out, the tree gradually dies,” he says.
 
 Ghawekar could locate three trees around Nagpur and is searching for more so that he can collect the seeds to prepare saplings which can be planted during the rainy season. “I found one on Hingna Road towards   opposite the Metro cement mixing plant and have been told that it is the only one left here now,” he says. 
 
 The other two are ahead of Kanolibara and near Mansar. Ghawekar could not find any such tree in the city.
 
 “My main concern is to locate as many trees as possible so that I can collect the flowers which holds the seed and prevent this species from getting extinct like the ones bearing purple flowers,” he say and adds that he will welcome anybody who joins in this effort. “The more people join, greater will be the amount of seeds we can collect and create many more saplings,” he says.
