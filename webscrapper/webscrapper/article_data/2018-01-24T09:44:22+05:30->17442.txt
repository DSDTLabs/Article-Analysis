 governor P Sathasivam, who is also the Chancellor of the University of Kerala, has constituted a search committee for the selection of new Vice-Chancellor for the University.

 The four year term of the current Vice Chancellor of the University - P K Radhakrishnan - is about to expire on February 22.
 
 Paul Antony, State Chief Secretary, is the government nominee and V K Ramachandran, state planning board vice chairman, is the University Senate representative in the search committee. R C Kuhad, Vice Chancellor of Central University of Haryana, is the UGC nominee in the committee. 
 
 The search committee is supposed to prepare a panel of eligible candidates and a single candidate on consensus basis to the post in three months.
 
 If the panel submits a list of eligible candidates, the governor can take a final call on whom should be appointed to the post. However, the practice in Kerala under the LDF regeime is to submit only one name to the chancellor, which gives him no choice for selection of candidates of his preference.
 
 Unless the committee is able to finalise the candidate in one month, the charge of the University Vice Chancellor would be vested with some one else. Currently, the CUSAT Vice Chancellor Letha is given the additional charge of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University in the state.
