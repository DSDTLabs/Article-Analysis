AHMEDABAD: In the five-year span since the Centre carved out a category for regional films for the coveted National Awards, Manish Saini has been the second non-Gujarati to do the   industry proud. His directorial debut ‘Dhh’ has been adjudged the best Gujarati film.

 In 2013, Goa-born Gyan Corea’s ‘The Good Road’ won the best Gujarati film prize at the National Awards.
 
 Saini’s children’s film ‘Dhh’ has been receiving acclaim all around the world at film festivals over the past few months. The story of three school-going kids with little interest in studies who seek shelter in magician’s tricks has won hearts of the jury. A person very bad at learning is called ‘dhh’ in the local language.
 
 Thirty-four-year Saini is from  , who has been settled in Ahmedabad for the past 14 years. He came to the city to study at the   in 2004. Since then, he has been living here. On why he chose to make the film in Gujarati, he told TOI, “The story had a local flavour and hence it had to be in the local language.” He said that many regional film industries such as those in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Kerala have got their identity. “The   industry must not follow them. We should have our own identity,” he said.
 
 On his choice to make a children’s film, Saini said, “Childhood is universal and hence everybody likes films on children. Moreover, you can make a good story of what you have experienced. We, as children, always wanted that we get a break from school.”
