 Investigators said that each of the items will be scrutinized to assess when last transaction took place — especially in the case of the bank accounts for which the documents have been found. 
 
 “Patel is not cooperating in the investigation. All the evidences are necessary to tie him and other accused to the case. We have also got detail of Rs 1.33 crore transactions involving him. Further probe is on. We do not rule out involvement of more persons in the case,” said the official.
