NCP politician and former deputy chief minister   on Wednesday said CM   must stop his ‘study’ of farmers’ issues and take a decisive stand on   waiver. Launching the fourth phase of the Sangarsh Yatra, Pawar came down heavily on the chief minister and the BJP government. “For how long is he going to study? It is time to appear for the exam and give results. The government must convene a special session of the state assembly to approve the loan  ,” he said. The opposition parties will intensify their agitation against the government, he added. Former   Prithviraj Chavan said the government was not serious about   suicides and that Fadnavis was dilly-dallying on taking a call on loan waiver. Speaking at a public meeting in Ratnagiri, Pawar, Chavan and others criticised Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Shiv Sena ministers, saying they targeted the BJP on the farm crisis but would not give up power. tnn
