LUCKNOW: Of the 90 online sexual harassment cases lodged in the past year, in around 75, no action could be initiated against the accused because the victims withdrew their complaints just before arrest was to be made, fearing stigma and backlash from the accused at a later stage.

 
 
  
  
 Police at cyber cell have now decided to start counselling of victims with the help of maliha thana and psychologists to make them understand that if allowed to go without punishment, the accused might later target others in the same manner.
 
 Nodal officer Abhay   said, “During investigation, we came across a very disturbing trend. In 75 cases, just as we were planning to arrest the perpetrators, the women complainants refused to pursue the case.”
 
 “They feared for their life, citing possibility of backlash from the harassers at a later stage after they had come out of prison,” said Mishra.
 
 Another big fear of the women and their families was a possibility of an   by the accused, he added.
 
 He also said that in 25 of these cases, the harassers were acquaintances or relatives of the women.
 
 “It is difficult to deal with such type of cases,” he said.
 
 About 20 complaints were of harassers who were friends with girls in school or college. They were desperate to seek revenge after they were “humiliated” by the girls in school or college. As many as 18 cases were of jilted lovers.
