nder the national agriculture development program (NADP), the department of horticulture is all set to distribute seeds this year at subsidised price for establishing terrace gardens in Trichy.

 The kit, comprising coco peat in UV ray treated polythene bag, seeds of ten vegetables, Ashosphyrillam, phosphobacteria, bio-fungicidesâ€“pseudomonas, Trichoderma Vridi, and water soluble fertilizers, is priced at `522. A subsidy of 40% will bring the price to `322 for each kit.
 
 The seeds of vegetables of 10 varieties will be packed in the kit. People can buy the seeds for `12 each. One customer can buy a maximum of six packets of seeds.
 
 "Terrace garden is aimed at producing vegetables on their own for the needs of a house. It will save our time and money to visit the market and buy vegetables. Terrace gardens can be set up with very minimum expense," said Trichy collector K Rajamani.
 
 People may have no clear idea as to what kind of fertilizers can be administered to the plants. Hence, the horticulture department has asked the people to go for organic fertilizers at the recommended limits and get a good yield of healthy and tasty vegetables. The department also encouraged the people to get technical guidance from the horticulture officials here. The kits will be available in the offices of the assistant director of horticulture in Trichy and all the panchayat union offices in the district.
 
 It may be recalled that the kit had been priced at `1,750 a couple of years back. The kit had included several accessories such as rose can and hand sprayer. The department excluded such accessories from the kit and fixed the price at `512 this year.
