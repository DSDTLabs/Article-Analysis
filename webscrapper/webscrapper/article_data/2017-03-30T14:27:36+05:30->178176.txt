As actor Dulquer Salmaan’s film   is prepping up for a release, it’s much-awaited teaser was released recently. The video features   in a shirt and mundu, and has him mocking a cop, played by Sujith Shankar. 

 With it’s youthful vibe of a college, the teaser might remind one of Premam, the recently released Oru Mexican Aparatha and Nivin Pauly’s Sakhavu. However, coming from a filmmaker, who works on unusual themes, one could expect something different from this venture of DQ. 
 
 Dulquer is seen asking the cop if he was part of KSU in Maharaja’s College, and also ridicules him with a question, ‘do you remember getting beaten up by SFI?’ The actor posted on his social networking page, “Here it is guys !! We have given this film our everything ! Cannot wait for you all to watch the final version. For now here is a little teaser ☺ ☺ 😁 😁 ! #ComradeInAmerica #CIA (CIA).”
 
 Directed by Amal Neerad, CIA has Karthika Muraleedharan playing a prominent role in the movie, that was shot in Mexico and Kottayam.
