Nagpur: The state principal chief conservator of forests (head of forest force) Shree Bhagwan on Monday constituted a six-member special investigating team (SIT) to probe the infamous Pench tiger poaching case. The option for CBI probe is also open. The team will be headed by Pench Tiger Reserve field director Rishikesh Ranjan while divisional forest officer (DFO) GK Vashishtha, Ramtek assistant conservator of forests (ACF) VK Borade, retired DFO Kishor Mishrikotkar, Satpuda Foundation president Kishor Rithe and wildlife lawyer Kartik Shukul are the members. “A draft is also being prepared to be forwarded to the state government for CBI investigation in the matter,” said top officials. Talking to TOI, principal secretary (forest) Vikas Kharge had hinted about CBI probe. As per the charge sheet filed in the Ramtek court, at least five tigers were killed and their body parts removed by 16 accused, all of whom are also involved in illegal fishing in Totladoh reservoir inside Pench Tiger Reserve. “SIT has been constituted for an impartial probe in the matter, especially after controversy that erupted over death of one of the accused Mahadeo Uikey, who escaped from forest custody and was found dead on August 26 near his village Dhawlapur,” said officials. On September 5, Deolapar police registered a FIR on a complaint by one of the accused Devidas Kumre against two range forest officers (RFOs) Nilesh Gawande and Pandurang Pakhale, investigating officials in the case. Kumre himself is the kingpin and 12kg tiger bones were seized from him. Amid all the controversy created by locals who were instigated by local Congress leaders, entire probe has been stalled since August 14. There has been no arrest nor any seizure in the last one month. Now SIT will accelerate the probe. The special team also means that ACF Geeta Nannaware, Gawande and Pakhale, who had really dug deep and gathered evidence to nail the poachers, have been kept out of the probe.
