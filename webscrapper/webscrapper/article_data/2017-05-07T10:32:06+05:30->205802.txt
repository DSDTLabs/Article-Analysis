VISAKHAPATNAM: With the   getting GI (Geographical Indication)   recently, the horticulture department is gearing up to pitch four more horticultural crops for the tag.

 As per the proposal mooted last year, the department will seek to obtain GI tag for Tella Chekkerakeli Banana grown in coastal districts, Cashew from Palasa in Srikakulam, Duggirala Turmeric in Guntur and KP Onion in Rayalseema during the next one year.
 
 Horticulture department commissioner   told TOI: "We had identified five products for GI tag last year, out of which we went ahead with Banaganapalle mangoes first, in view of its popularity. Now that we are familiar with the process, we will go ahead ahead with the other four products." 
 
 "The process is likely to take about one year as sufficient time has to be given to the public to raise objections if any. Besides, other formalities need to be completed," he added.
 
 Obtaining the tag will boost exports, he said. “We are developing marketing linkages and also going to provide publicity so that farmers can make the most of it. We have a lot of work to do as these are the special products of AP. Our aim is to provide value to the products by getting them the tag which helps in branding and value addition,” Chowdhary said.
 
 As per the application made to the GI Registry, Banaganapalle mangoes also known as Beneshan, Baneshan, Benishan, Chappatai, Safeda, Banaganapalli, or Banginapalli are popular and extensively used fruit all over the world. The agro-climatic and geographical conditions prevailing in Banaganapalle in Kurnool district and adjoining areas has given the unique characteristic to the mangoes for more than 100 years.
