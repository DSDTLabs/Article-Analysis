Starring Sathvik Eshvar, Pratyush, Akshita and Harshitha Singh in lead roles and directed by Nimmala Prabhas,   features five songs on the album composed by Prabhas. First on the album is Kanule Chusina, sung by Karthik and penned by Mahesh Khanna. The romantic number is just like any other starry-eyed song, featuring sugary sweet lyrics. The music, lyrics and tune of this number fail to do much to elevate it. 

 Chirujalle Kurisele, sung by Yazin Nizar and Rita and penned by Prabhas Nimmala himself is also a romantic number, though Yazin’s vocals seem to elevate this number a bit. The lyrics, tune and music still fail to make a mark though. Third on the album is Manase Kanaleva, sung by Sunitha and Anurag 
 Kulkarni, penned by Prabhas Nimmala. Sunitha is the saving grace of this number which features average lyrics, tune and music. However, compared to the rest of the album so far, Manase Kanaleva is good for a one-time listen. 
 
 Yevaru Chesina Papam, sung by Vijay Yesudas and penned by Chandrabose is a 90s-style socially conscious number that is elevated by the lyrics and vocals. The tune and music, however, fail to leave a lasting impression. Last on the album is Oora Mass sung by Malathi, featuring Prabhas Nimmala’s lyrics is as the title suggests a ‘special’ mass number that talks of how ‘oora mass’ some minister character in the film is. The song sounds like any other Tollywood special number with regressive lyrics. 
 
 All in all, give the album of Satya Gang a miss this weekend unless subpar lyrics, music and tunes float your boat. If forced to choose, Manase Kanaleva and Yevaru Chesina Papam are the stand-out numbers of this album, only due to Sunitha and Vijay Yesudas’ vocals. They’re good for a one-time listen.
