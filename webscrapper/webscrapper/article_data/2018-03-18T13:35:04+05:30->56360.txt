CHARMINAR: Odour from an unknown chemical created   among people in the   area on Saturday, after many complained of burning eyes and shortness of breath for almost 15-20 minutes. 

 As news of the odour spread, local police was forced to step in and seek help from the fire department to bring the situation under control. The incident occurred between 2pm and 3pm, according to officers at the   police station.
 
 "We rushed to the spot with personnel from the fire department after locals informed us about people suffering because of an unknown chemical. The situation normalised when the firemen sprayed an anti-chemical vapour," said N Lingaiah, station house officer of Shah Ali Banda.
 
 Shopkeepers said that the horrible smell and itching in their eyes drove them out of their shops and forced many to cover their noses. "There was a chemical leak from a vehicle that crossed the route. The problem started right after that," said one of them.
 
 The brief spell of panic also threw traffic out of gear for hours along the busy Syed Ali Chabutra and   road. Later, the traffic and law and order personnel had to rush to the spot to restore traffic movement.
 
 The police said that clues teams have been pressed into service to ascertain the exact cause of the chemical smell.
