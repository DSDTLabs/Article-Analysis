CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   said on Saturday that the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) pushed farmers of the state into the "vicious debt trap" because of its "lopsided policies", but was now trying to project itself as a "farmers' messiah just to revive its political fortunes". 

 "It did not take any steps for the welfare of farmers when it was in power for 10 years," he said.
 
 His statement came a day after the SAD submitted a memorandum to the Punjab governor to seek directions for a Rs 90,000-crore farm loan waiver. 
 
 The chief minister said if the SAD was so concerned about the plight of farmers, why did it not do anything for them when it was in power. 
 
 The CM lashed out at the SAD for "playing to the gallery" on a sensitive issue that had serious financial implications. 
 
 He went on to urge the SAD not to indulge in criticism and appreciate the   government's efforts to bring the state economy back on track. 
 
 Reacting to questions on probes ordered into sacrilege cases, the chief minister said   were trying their best to save their skin in view of their "complicity" in such cases. 
 
 "Akalis are trying their best to promote their political interests over the farm debt waiver issue. They work as a constructive opposition to ensure development of the state," he said.
