Welcome the ‘year of the yellow dog’ home...

 The   has just started and according to their calendar, the year 2018 is all about calmness and peace. That’s because it is the year of the Yang Earth Dog or WU XU, which is supposed to usher in fairness and honesty in your life. According to Chinese rituals, the Yellow Earth Dog is portrayed as peacefully lying down on the grass, looking at the setting sun, without fatigue, accumulating life wisdom, and a calm which brings with it the well-earned rest. So, the dog is not weary; rather, it is relaxed. 
 
 
 
 Your home should mirror it but keep the liveliness. Dogs like to play, so make sure there are games, dancing, running around, and general merriment. The yellow dog will help you create more luck. Decorate the patio or entrance with roses, and fairy lights. Stick to yellow, orange and gold, as this year’s ruler colour is yellow.
 
 Interestingly, yellow is characteristic of 2018 and embodies both tranquillity and conservatism. Do not wear animal print dresses, shirts or pants. Avoid zebra, giraffe or leopard print – in clothes or home decor. Keep a tray of yellow oranges, red envelope and tea on your table to attract luck and abundance.
