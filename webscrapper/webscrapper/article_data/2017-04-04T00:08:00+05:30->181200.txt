Indore:   doctors on Monday performed two complex   back to back on two persons who sustained critical injuries after being shot with bow and   in a clash reported in Alirajpur district.

 The team, led by Dr Sonia Moses and Dr RS Raikwar, removed arrowheads that were lodged in the victims’ chests. The procedures lasted five hours.
 
 Shankar Singh (50) and Faru (20), both residents of Alirajpur, were referred to MY Hospital after a dispute reported on Saturday.
 
 Medical investigations revealed that an arrow had penetrated through Singh’s left upper chest and had entered the right side. It was lodged close to the heart, further causing serious damage.
 
 Similarly, Faru sustained critical injuries after an arrow penetrated the left of his chest, damaging his diaphragm and was stuck to the large intestine causing excessive bleeding.
 
 While they were on their way to the hospital, members of their families broke the wooden shafts of the arrows to pull them out. However, it made the situation worse as it further damaged internal organs of both victims.
 
 According to the surgeons, both surgeries were challenging and any minute mistake could have lead to failure. The patients will be kept in observation for the next few days.
 
 Dr Sachin Verma, Dr Sandesh Khandelwal, Dr Pravin Agrawal and Dr Sonu Patidar also contributed to the success of both surgeries.
