Gandhinagar: One day after the leader of opposition Shankersinh Vaghela resigned from the Congress party, Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki, former president Arjun Modhwadia and other party functionaries rushed to New Delhi to meet Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

 Though all the Congress functionaries will not comment on what they discussed about the recent cross voting by 11 Gujarat Congress MLAs in the presidential election, it’s believed they discussed a strategy to counter further damage from Vaghela, including a possible attempt to spoil the chances of senior leader Ahmed Patel being re-elected to the Rajya Sabha.
 
 Bharatsinh Solanki said, “We discussed future party programmes and his campaign in the state. He has instructed to prepare a more aggressive campaign plan.” 
 
 On Vaghela’s exit, Solanki said, “As he has already left the party there is no need discuss him. There will be no effect on the Rajya Sabha elections.” tnn
