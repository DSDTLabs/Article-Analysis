KOZHIKODE: Nationalist   (NCP) leader and former minister   said that he was happy over the decision to induct   nominee   MLA into the state cabinet. 

 Speaking to media persons here on Friday, Saseendran said that he didn't even remotely consider the thought of returning to the cabinet after the TV channel which aired a sex- tape purportedly of his conservation with a woman that led to his resignation on Sunday, tendered an apology late Thursday night.
 
 "I am not thinking about returning to the cabinet now. I had never considered minister-ship as a big thing and I am glad that I could take the decision to tender my resignation upholding the interests of my party and   without trying to defend myself even for a moment," Saseendran said.
 
 He said that he would go to Thiruvananthapuram to take part on the swearing in of Thomas Chandy to be held on Saturday. Saseendran said he was guided by the politics of LDF which was not about protecting minister-ship of an individual but about upholding the morality in politics.
 
 Saseendran said that he would cooperate with the various enquiries under way into the incident. Asked whether there was need for simultaneous judicial probe and police investigation into the incident, he said that it was a matter which has to be decided by the LDF and the state government. "I am happy that the incident set off serious discussion among general public about the functioning of media," he said.
 
 Meanwhile women journalists took out a march in the city in protest against  's phone trap operation. They said that the sting operation has put the entire media fraternity in the state under cloud.
