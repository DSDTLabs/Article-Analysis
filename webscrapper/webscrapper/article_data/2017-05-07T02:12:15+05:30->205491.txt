KOLKATA: Faced with   by  , the state has given a proposal to the   (MCI) about introducing   training for stress-busting and self-defence for medical students in all government medical college and hospitals.

 Debashis Bhattacharya, the state director of medical education, gave the proposal at a recent MCI meeting in New Delhi on April 28, where state directors of medical education, health department secretaries and MCI members were present to discuss the issue of increased incidents of violence at hospitals. “I gave a verbal proposal about the introduction of taekwondo training in government medical colleges. It would be great if MCI approves the proposal and includes taekwondo training in the MBBS curriculum. Taekwondo is very beneficial as it helps build mental and physical health,” Bhattacharya said.
 
 In a first-such initiative in a government-run hospital in the country, a group of over 100   of NRS Medical College and Hospital have started attending a taekwondo training course. Also, resident doctors of Delhi’s AIIMS have decided to introduce self-defence classes on campus, including ones for taekwondo, that will start from May 15.
 
 NRS Hospital deputy superintendent Dwaipayan Biswas, a taekwondo practitioner, was the first to come up with the idea of introducing taekwondo training for the hospital’s doctors. “Taekwondo training is very beneficial as it helps build up self-discipline, self-confidence and aids in stress relief — something doctors need on a daily basis to cope with stress,” he said.
 
 Taekwondo master Pradipta Kumar Roy, who is also the first Indian athlete to be the Kukkiwon (World Taekwondo Headquarters, South Korea) overseas master, said martial arts training is a regular feature in many institutions across the world. “I support the proposal. Taekwondo builds character and self-control,” he said. Roy has been engaged in giving taekwondo training to doctors and students at NRS Hospital.
