CALANGUTE: Tourists from across the country and world make it a point to visit the   beach before heading to any other place in the state, said tourism minister  , at the inauguration of a project on beautifying the Calangute tinto on Friday. He said a lot of development work has been done in Calangute, but still a lot more needs to be done.

 “We need more facilities on the beach, such as changing rooms, toilets and lockers. Calangute MLA   has worked hard to bring about change and there has been tremendous improvement, much more than in any other coastal constituency,” he said.
 
 The beautification project, done at a cost of Rs 1.2 crore, includes a new entrance gate, stage for the local Shantadurga temple, a traffic circle at the market junction and footpaths. However, work on installing decorative lights is yet to completed.
