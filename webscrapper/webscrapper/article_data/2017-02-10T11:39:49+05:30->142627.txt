  State chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh on Thursday gave this directive to the education department officials at a meeting of the departmental heads convened to review the department wise spends made till February 8. Singh also directed the panchayati raj department to transfer funds to the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) concerned soon.
