THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   has demanded chief minister   to apologise on the   made by   against World Bank team leader Bernard Aritua. Chennithala issued the statement in the wake of reports that World Bank has sent a letter to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely on the issue.

 “Such a racist remark was unexpected from a leader like G Sudhakaran. This had eroded reputation of the state at the global level. Malayalees worldwide are insulted by his statements. Ours is a society which has taken a strong stand against racism. We have a history of seeing everyone as equals, irrespective of their caste, gender and race. Indians, especially Malayalees, welcome all cultures. This was dented by the irresponsible statement of the minister,” said Chennithala.
 
 “Senior officials of World Bank ethics committee vice president, south Asian vice president and human resources vice president have sent letter to Union finance minister Arun Jaitely. This will affect many of our projects, including KSTP. So   must apologize on the remarks,” Chennithala said.
