LUCKNOW: Terming the SP Cong tie-up as an alliance of “corruption and goondagardi“, UP BJP chief   said that even the   was party of it indirectly.
Maurya's remarks came after   vice-president   showered praise on BSP chief  .
 
 Hitting out at the alliance, Maurya said the BJP had been saying that scams worth Rs 12 lakh crore were reported during the UPA government before BJP came to power in 2014. Now with SP and Congress joining hands, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav should spell out what his share was in the scams, he added.
 
 Maurya also said that Akhilesh's claim of development had fallen flat as he was forced to shake hands with Congress.Had it not been the case, he would have gone alone, the UP BJP chief added.
 
 Maurya also said that efforts would be made to get a grand temple constructed in Ayodhya either after the court order or a compromise formula between the two parties.
