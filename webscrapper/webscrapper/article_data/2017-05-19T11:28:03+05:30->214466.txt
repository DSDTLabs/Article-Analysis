Kolkata: The   (HMC) has issued an eviction notice to the shops in and around   — an abode of  . The decision comes after the National Green Tribunal, Eastern Zone Bench, Kolkata, issued an order in April this year, asking the civic body to make the bird sanctuary pollution-free. The NGT took up the case after TOI published an article in January 2016 showing the water outlets of this jheel have been filled up due to encroachment.

 In the order issued recently, the HMC commissioner asked all the unauthorized shop and restaurant owners to vacate the bird sanctuary area at the earliest. According to the order, the land belongs to South Eastern Railway and they don’t have any right to encroach upon it. An HMC source said there are around 175 shops and restaurants in and around the sanctuary. 
 
 The TOI article from January 15 mentions that the jheel was encircled by six other   that connected this sanctuary to the river. In the last 10 years, all the six lakes were filled up for development. This has not only stopped the flow of river water into the main birds’ sanctuary but is not allowing the birds to reach there.
 
 In January 2016, the NGT, after hearing a petition by environmental activist Subhash Dutta, had asked the HMC to clear all plastic material in the jheel with immediate effect. In July 2016, the court asked the HMC to submit a detailed project report including the expenditure for the construction of a drain parallel to the jheel.
 
 “We understand that the NGT is concerned about the lake, though the main problem is yet to be sorted. We hope the lake will become free from encroachers and there will be a steady flow of water that will help the lake to fight pollution,” said environmental activist Goutam Patra, working for the protection of the jheel.
