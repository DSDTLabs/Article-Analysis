INDORE: Every human being has the right to be loved and treated fair and so as transgender, who are also an important part of the society, said   Laxmi Narayan Tripathi on Saturday. 

 Speaking at district conference of Rotary District 3040, Tripathi said, “It’s unfortunate that transgender don’t have any rights in our society and have not been accepted by it. They too have all the rights to live independently as other human beings.” 
 
 The conference was attended by over 1,200 Rotarians and delegates. Members of the club had come from 25 districts of   and four districts of Gujarat. 
 
 Tripathi said that she has special affection for Madhya Pradesh as the state was the first to choose a transgender mayor. 
 
 “It is unfortunate that instead of moving towards a more open society for women we are narrowing our thoughts for them,” said Tripathi. 
 
 Rotarians discussed about development and welfare plans of the club and the ways to achieve the target. 
 
 Singer   sang religious verses at the event. Six speakers addressed the gathering on the first day of the conference. 
 
 Ghanshyam Singh, a Rotarian said, “Money is not required to initiate welfare work; a person can help others even by motivating and encouraging others.”
