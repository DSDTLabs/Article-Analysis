GREATE NOIDA: A man claiming to be a leader of a local outfit,   Raksha Dal, was arrested on Saturday for forcing meat   to   their shutters during Navratri in  . The accused has been identified as Ved Nagar, a resident of Acheja village in Greater Noida.

 In the past one week, the outfit had forced several   shops to   down at different places in Greater Noida.
 
 Manish Saxena, PRO, Noida police, said the personnel of Badalpur police station received information that Nagar along with some supporters will again try to shut down some meat shops on Saturday. “The police also received information from media persons that he was involved in such activities in the past. We traced the accused to Acheja village and arrested him under Section 151 of IPC,” he said.
 
 The outfit had earlier claimed that it had petitioned the district administration and Badalpur police station last month to stop selling of meat during Navratri. Since they did not receive any response, they decided to do it themselves. Fearing vandalism, many more meat and fish sellers decided to shut shop voluntarily.
 
 District magistrate B N Singh said he directed the police to take action against such people who try to disturb peace. “We will not allow any person to breach the law and order situation,” he said.
 
 Earlier, Suniti, SP (rural), Gautam Budh Nagar, said the local intelligence unit has been asked to report such matters when they get to know about them. The SHOs have also been asked to ensure that law and order is not compromised in the district.
