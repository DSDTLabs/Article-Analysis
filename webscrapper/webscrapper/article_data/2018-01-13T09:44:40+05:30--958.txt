PANAJI: Alleging that Goa’s two Lok   members and one Rajya Sabha member were mute in Parliament when it came to articulating the wishes of Goans for special status and against coal expansion,   general secretary and spokesperson,   said that people couldn’t depend on chief minister   for his statements against coal expansion because of his legacy of U-turns.

 “The two   MPs need to be reminded that in their 2014 Lok Sabha election manifesto, they had promised special status for Goa on which basis Goans had elected them. This promise was also repeated with a ‘thumping of chest’ in the BJP’s public meeting at Merces ground prior to the Lok Sabha election, by Mr  ,”   said
