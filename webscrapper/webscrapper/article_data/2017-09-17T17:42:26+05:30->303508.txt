AHMEDABAD: Union Minister of State for Social Justice   on Sunday said that reservation is the biggest reason of atrocities against dalits by dominant caste people and batted for 25% economically backward class ( ) quota in jobs and education “to avoid caste-based conflicts and to unite all the communities.”   said that the parliament should soon amend the law so that reservation restricted up to 50% by the Supreme court can be surpassed.

 “In Gujarat, Hardik Patel is demanding reservation for Patels and in Haryana, Jats are demanding reservations. Similarly, there is a rising demand of quota from Rajputs in Rajasthan and Marathas in Maharashtra. In a meeting of   allies on May 10, I had said that the biggest reason of the atrocities against the dalits is reservation system. (This is) because the people belonging to the general category believe that dalits are taking away their rights by getting reservations, which in turn invokes hatred and animosity in them,” Athawale told reporters at a press conference here.
 
 The   (RPI) MP said that the new law for implementation of 75% reservation should include provisions for “quota in promotion for SC, ST and OBCs.” When asked if the allies of NDA agree with his proposal, he said, “I will take this matter before the Prime Minister. Although, there may be difference of opinion but this (proposal) will be considered.”
 
 Talking about Una flogging case, Athawale said, “The Gujarat government has taken swift action in the case and all the accused were booked.
 
 Athawale said that Gujarat has witnessed 1355 and 1144 atrocity cases in 2016 and 2017 respectively but the conviction rate of such cases is below 4.5% which is a matter of concern. He said that North Gujarat and   are the atrocity-prone regions of the state and demanded to form a special police force to deal with such cases.
