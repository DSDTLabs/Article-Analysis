New Delhi: Taking a dig at RJD ally   (United) and Bihar chief minister  , Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party chief   said if   had to blame someone for the current investigations against him, it should be Nitish, who had been demanding action against benami properties. 

  "When PM announced demonetisation, Nitish Kumar had said it was not a big step. He had said the real test would be cracking down on benami properties. The present cases against Lalu are related to benami properties," he said, "If benami property cases are being investigated, where is politics? If there is politics, then it is Nitish behind it. Laluji must ask questions to Nitish." 
 
 He claimed that the centre had nothing to do with CBI raids on the premises of Lalu. "He was already in jail over his involvement in the fodder scam. There was no   government at that time. The court had ordered it. Today's (Friday's) raids were in relation with corruption charges against him. The charges are documented. Political parties or NDA government has nothing to do with it," he said.
