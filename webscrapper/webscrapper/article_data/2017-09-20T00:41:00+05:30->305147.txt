Coimbatore: Raising voices is a right, students’ associations say, but Tamil Nadu has curbed students’ voices by not allowing unions and associations in colleges. AISF general secretary M Gunasekar said, “For a long time, we have been telling that Tamil Nadu does not have students’ association to allow them to voice opinions. Most other states encourage students’ unions and conduct elections.”

 The students’ association leader said that only if colleges allow students’ to debate and talk about social and public issues, will there be a way for them to become politicians in the future. “In the past 20years, how many youth have joined politics in Tamil Nadu? If there is no platform for students in colleges, they will not think of becoming one,” said Gunasekar.
 
 Teachers’ associations too are supportive of this. “We have been urging colleges and universities to have students’ unions. There is hardly any other way through which we can get to know about their grievances,” said the vice-president of Association of University Teachers, N Pasupathi. “Colleges have a grievance box or online grievance registering system which gives away the opportunity of dialogue,” he added.
 
 On the other hand, even if students come forward to place an opinion, it does not bear weight as there is no support behind them. “When there is a union, you have the backing of a group. This gives weight to the voice of the representative,” Pasupathi added.
 
 While there are no students’ unions, most colleges have department associations. This is primarily to organise department activities. The associations are never a medium or platform for the students to place their grievances. In some colleges, there are class level representatives who meet teachers occasionally to talk about their views on academic activities.
