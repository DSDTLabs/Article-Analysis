Panaji: A group of over 10 Goan authors and activists have written an open letter to the chairman of Konkani Akademi regarding the selection of Sudirsukt — a poetry book penned by former St Andre MLA Vishnu Wagh — for an award. The signatories to the letter are of the opinion that the book and its contents will not prove to be a threat to the social fabric, as perceived by a section of readers. 

 The tome was caught in a row when Konkani writer Sanjiv Verekar prematurely made a public disclosure that the jury of the Konkani Akademi Committee, in its confidential deliberation, had selected the book for an award this year.
 
 Some readers alleged that the content of a few poems could potentially incite social tension between castes within the Hindu community. In the letter addressed to the Akademi, Albertina Almeida, Alito Siqueira, Amita Kanekar and Angela Ferrao, among others, reasoned that the book has not provoked any agitation ever since its release in 2013.
 
 “Verekar’s ‘leak’ seems to have been aimed to agitate the public against the jury’s decision, as he had been a minority dissenting voice in the jury that selected the book for the award,” the letter read.
 
  It opined that the book expresses the pain, revolt, revulsion, angst and anger towards the age-old caste system that still persists in society.
