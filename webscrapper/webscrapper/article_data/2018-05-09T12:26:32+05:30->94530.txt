The   police on Tuesday said the two engineering students arrested for allegedly   the website of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) wanted to test their skill and show off their achievement.

 Akash Chopade and Chinmay Ultrahalkar, both aged 21, were arrested after a complaint was lodged against them by the SPPU Nashik sub-centre staff for downloading the Linear Algebra examination paper and then circulating it on WhatsApp.
 
 
 On Monday, the duo was remanded in police custody for three days. They carried out the alleged crime before the exam took place on April 28.
 
 “When questioned, the students claimed that they had hacked the website and downloaded the question paper out of curiosity. Both of them are bright students and wanted to try their luck in hacking a website. They took it as a challenge,” a police officer said.
 
 The cyber crime police have ruled out the possibility of monetary gains from the hacking and the question paper leak. “They did not want to make money. We have checked their family background. Both of them hail from well-to-do families,” the officer said.
 
 Akash is a resident of Cidco area of Nashik and Chinmay hails from Jalgaon. Chinmay is staying in Nashik to pursue engineering. Both are students of the same college in Nashik.
 
 According to police, the duo does not have any past record of hacking. “It was their first attempt to hack a website and they were successful,” the police officer said.
 
 “Soon, the question paper was widely circulated on social media. Some examinees got access to it,” the officer said.
 
 A three-member team set up by SPPU vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar cracked the case of the question paper leak.
