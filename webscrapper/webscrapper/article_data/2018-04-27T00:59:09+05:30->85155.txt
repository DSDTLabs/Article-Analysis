Udhagamandalam: Finally, both the locals and the tourists can use the footpath on Garden Road in Ooty freely. The credit goes to the district collector, J Innocent Divya, who instructed municipality officials to evict all the 34 shops illegally put up on the footpath that covers a distance of 700 metres from Charing Cross Junction to the Government Botanical Garden.

 “The joy in any hill station is nothing but taking a stroll to appreciate the landscape. Decades ago, broad footpaths were the hallmark of all the main roads in Ooty town. They were over the years encroached by either shopkeepers or hawkers,” said V Sivadass, managing trustee, NEST, an environmental organisation.
 
 “It has been a long-pending demand. Thanks to the district administration for paying heed to our requests and respecting the rights of pedestrians,” he added.
 
 Innocent Divya and the district superintendent of police, Murali Rambha, had a few days ago inspected Garden Road and interacted with the vendors on the footpath. Following this, the collector urged the municipality officials to evict the illegal occupants on the footpath with the help of the police.
 
 “We evicted all the 34 vendors and alternative arrangements have been made for their livelihood,” said C Ravi, Ooty municipal commissioner incharge.
 
 The evicted vendors were shifted to Breeks ground near the Government Botanical Garden. “It is a permanent solution for the vendors as well the pedestrians,” Innocent Divya said.
 
 “Most footpaths in the town are encroached, forcing pedestrians to walk on busy roads. Besides adding to the traffic woes, walking on roads pose huge risk to the pedestrians. Hence we have evicted the vendors from the footpath on Garden Road,” she added.
 
 Sivadass, meanwhile, urged the district administration to evict the shopkeepers on the footpaths on Commercial Road and Ettinne’s Road.
