HYDERABAD: Taking note of the high number of   over the past few years, the   have kicked off a   to make roads across the  .

 As part of the first phase of this project, vendors, hawkers and other temporary encroachers were vacated from footpaths in Attapur earlier this week. Starting from pillar number 150, which falls within the Rajendranagar police limits, encroachments will be removed up to Aramghar soon, said officials.
 
 A R Srinivas, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Cyberabad, said, “When we analysed the fatal road accidents of 2016, pedestrians made up a clear majority of the total number of victims.This is why we have kicked off this special drive. To address the lack of infrastructure for pedestrians, we have sent a request to GHMC for constructing 30 pelican signals within Cyberabad limits.“
 
 A pelican signal is a pedestrian-controlled signal. A pedestrian has to press a button at the signal and wait for a few minutes, after which the light turns green and pedestrians can cross the road safely.
 
 The process of removing encroachments from footpaths will be taken up at Madhapur, Kukatpally , Balanagar, Jeedimetla and Kompally , officials added.
 
 “The ongoing metro work has added to pedestrians' woes. The lack of infrastructure for pedestrians in Hyderabad is startling. There are not enough foot overbridges or pedestrian subways. Many busy junctions do not have pedestrian crossings. It is almost as if pedestrians are not considered a category of road users,“ said Pavan Kothuri, a resident of Kukatpally.
