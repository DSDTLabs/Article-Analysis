NASHIK: The   should come up with a way to deal with the issue of   at the   signal and provide a free left turn for moving towards  , demanded motorists on Monday.

 During peak hours, taking a left on the road in itself becomes a task as large number of motorists block the entire stretch of the road. A large number of motorists from Trimurti Chowk use the road opposite the mall to move towards Trimbak Road, College Road or Gangapur Road.
 
 In view of the increasing flow of traffic on the Untawadi Road, the civic administration has set up a traffic signal near the mall to regulate the flow of vehicles towards Trimurti Chowk, ABB Circle, Mico circle and Indiranagar underpass.
 
 A large number of people use their private vehicles to move from Trimurti Chowk towards ABB Circle, which leads to Trimbak, Gangapur and College roads. While these motorists have to take a simple left from the signal to move towards the ABB circle, other motorists on the signal heading towards Mico Circle block the entire road, leaving no scope for taking a left towards ABB circle.
 
 Motorists are of the view that the traffic department should put bollards at the said signal to separate the traffic moving straight towards Mico Circle and ABB circle. 
 
 “While the road on the Trimurti Chowk side is comparatively narrow, it is too wide near the signal. Hence, every motorist halting at the signal wants to be in the front row so that they can move head fast upon getting a green light,” said a motorist, who travels on this stretch regularly.
 
 He added, “The tussle of getting in the front line at the signal blocks the entire road, leaving no space for others who want to proceed towards the ABB Circle. The way bollards have helped in streamlining the traffic on Gangapur Road, the same should be adopted for Trimurti Chowk signal.”
 
 Senior   officials said that they would be studying the problem and take the necessary measures as required.
