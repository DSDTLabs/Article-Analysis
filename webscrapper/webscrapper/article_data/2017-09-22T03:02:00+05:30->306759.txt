Panaji: Many generations before prime-time bashing and social media memes became forums not only for dissent but also for marketing ideologies, influential people took to theatre to make their voices heard. One such figure was Jiang Qing of China, who fell in love with the art form just as she got entangled in the political revolution in her country. To celebrate the theatrical personality of Qing alias Madame Mao, around 20 actors, dancers and singers of the Goa-based Mustard Seeds Art Company will present a play ‘Hold Up the Sky’, in Margao and Panaji next week. Written and directed by Isabel Santa Rita Vas, the two-hour-long play will take its audience back to the power of theatre in Shanghai in the 1930s, where an ambitious and talented Qing is a member of the ‘Gang of Four’. While she is responsible for launching a rebellion against the oppressive practices against women in imperial China, her adventurous nature leads her to flirt with politics, and she ultimately marries the oppressor, Mao Zedong. “The theatre that she has always loved now becomes her instrument to propagate the Cultural Revolution in China and suppress all freedom of thought and expression. ‘Hold Up the Sky’ is a fictionalised dramatisation of Madame Mao’s colourful choices in life and theatre,” Vas says.  The play will be staged at Gomant Vidya Niketan, Margao, on September 26 and at Institute Menezes Braganza, Panaji, on September 28. Shows at both venues will begin at 6.30pm.
