Actress  , who played the ghost in Ranjith Sankar’s Pretham, is now set to play a different role in Jis Joy’s directorial,  .

 The romcom that features   and   as lovers, will see Sruti essaying Asif’s ex-girlfriend. The director tells us, “She will be playing a girl named Sithara and has an equally prominent role in the movie as Aparna. I cannot reveal much about her 
 role right now, as it will be a spoiler.”
 
 While Asif plays a youth named Amal from Kannur who lands in Kochi, Aparna essays the role of a smart girl, Anu, who falls in love with him and inspires him to chase his dreams. “In my previous movies, Njan and Pretham, I played a simple somewhat sober girl, but here I will be seen as a fun loving happy-go-lucky girl,” says an excited Sruti, adding that it is the first time the audience will get to see her smiling on the silver screen.
 
 Expected to release by May first week, the film is currently under post-production. “We have extensively shot the film in places such as Thalassery, Ottapalam, Ezhupunna and Ernakulam and the shoot was completed on March 9,” says Jis. Sunday Holiday will also have Sreenivasan, director Lal Jose, Alencier and KPAC Lalitha playing important roles.
