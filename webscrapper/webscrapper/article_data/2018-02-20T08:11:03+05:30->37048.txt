BHOPAL: This will send alarm bells ringing across the state. The   is so low that a national kayaking championship cannot be held at its original location -   - leaving organisers scrambling for a new spot at the last minute. 

 The patchy monsoon of 2017 has raised fears of drought-like conditions in parts of the state. Though  , where Maheshwar is located, isn't among the drought-affected districts, the very fact that   isn't flowing at normal level before onset of summer is cause for concern. Maheshwar has the only permanent slalom course in the country. It's an Olympic sport where kayakers fight river rapids to navigate through a course of hanging gates in the shortest time possible. The best part of Maheshwar slalom centre is that it is built on natural white-water. In all, 50 poles are erected for 25 gates on a 250m course.
 
 The national meet is scheduled to start on February 24 but organisers realise there isn't enough water at the spot. They are now rushing to build a new course.
 
 Secretary of MP kayaking and canoeing association, Prashant Kushwaha, confirmed that 12 gates have been shifted. "The level of water is very low on the course where the permanent structure is constructed. We had no option. The gates have been shifted to an adjacent flow where water is available," said Kushwaha.
 
 Organisers have requested the district administration to open the gates and a decision is likely on Tuesday. Around 350 players from 23 states will contest in the championship.
