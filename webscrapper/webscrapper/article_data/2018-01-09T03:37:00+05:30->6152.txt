Guntur: Strongly advocating conduct of ‘yagnas’ and ‘yagas’ in the capital city region, chief minister N   has observed that such special prayers and ‘homams’ will help the new state of Andhra Pradesh grow at a fast pace, ensuring welfare of the people.

 Participating in the ‘Aswamedha Gayatri Maha Yagnam’ being organised by the All India Gayatri Parishad on the NRI Medical College campus on Tuesday, the chief minister said that power is a symbol of patience and knowledge. It can be gained only through praying to the God. “It is not easy to attain energy that helps spread wisdom. It can be achieved only with patience and knowledge. Performance of ‘yagnas’give spiritual power to attain energy and wisdom,” the chief minister said.
 
 The CM thanked the ‘Gayatri parivar’ for choosing the new capital city region for conducting its 43rd edition of ‘yagnam’ after a series of such events across the country. The state government is organising special pujas for river goddesses Krishna and Godavari as the entire agriculture sector is dependent on holy rivers.
 
 He said that the government is conducting Eruvaka - a special prayer to Mother Earth for the welfare of farmers and Pavitra Harathi for conservation of water resources every year. He said the government is planning to tap solar power in a big way as a tribute to Lord Surya. All prayers, yagas and yagnas should be aimed at the well-being of the entire humankind.
 
 Naidu promised to allocate land if Gayatri Parivar comes forward to set up its chapter in the capital city area. Chief coordinator of   Dr Chinmaya Pandya, civil supplies minister Prathipati Pulla Rao, social welfare minister Nakka Anand Babu, Gayatri Parivar south India coordinator Dr Aswani Subba Rao, district collector Kona Sasidhar and SP Ch Vijaya Rao were present.
