NEW DELHI: Three global players and an Indian company are in race for bagging the first lot of 1,700 kilometers of completed   projects through auction.   (NHAI) has received bids from Macquarie, Brookfield, ROADIS-NIIF (National Infrastructure Investment Fund) and IRB.

 
 The   authority had invited bids for a bunch of already operational stretches under its toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model, with an aim to monetise public-funded roads. “We hope to select the most competitive bidder within next 10-12 days,” NHAI’s member (finance) Rohit Kumar Singh said. The successful bidder will make the upfront payment to NHAI and will have the right to collect toll for the defined contract period.
 
 Highways minister   has said the upfront revenue from the auction of highway projects would be utilised by the government to meet its fund requirements for expanding and building more highways.
