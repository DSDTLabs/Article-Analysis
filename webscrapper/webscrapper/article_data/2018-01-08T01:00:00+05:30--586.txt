This would sound like music to singer   Malik’s fans. The young singer has secured a spot on the list of Most Talked About Male   Celebrities and Most Talked About Gen-Next Bollywood Celebrities, created by a social micro-blogging website as a part of its annual follower research. 

 The 22-year-old is among the youngest men to be featured on these lists that also have Bollywood actors like   and Shah Rukh Khan. It could be seen as an indication that like the West, pop culture is on a near-equal footing on social networks with the Hindi film industry. 
 
 Speaking to Bombay Times, Armaan said, “I am ecstatic to have made it to this list alongside such esteemed members of the fraternity. A huge credit for this goes to my fans ‘The Armaanians’. If it wasn’t for their love and support, I wouldn’t be where I am.”
 
 In 2017, several FMCG brands collaborated with the singer for ad jingles, flagging off a trend to tap young talent with great social media following to get their message across. With this new feather in his cap, Armaan and his followers look forward to a rocking 2018!
