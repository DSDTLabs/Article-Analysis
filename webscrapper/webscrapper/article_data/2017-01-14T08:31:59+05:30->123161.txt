AHMEDABAD: On the sacred twelfth day of Saptak, on Thursday, in sync with the sanctity of the number twelve, as of the twelve Jyotirlingas, twelve principal Olympians gods, twelve Tribes of Israel, twelve apostles of Jesus, twelve petals in Anahata, the muses descended on the   hall, as Saptak invoked Raga Bihag in the late Pandit  's haunting voice. It prepared the stage for surbahar, by Irshad Khan, accompanied on pakhawaj by Pratap Awad. He sonorously sailed through Raga Darbari, followed by thumri with G-sharp and tonic sound, proving that East does meet West in the world of music. His resounding rendering was followed by a semi-classical offering, by Mohanlal Mishra in Gorakh Kalyan, enriched on tabla by Gopal Mishra, harmo nium by Kantaprasad Mishra and sarangi by Ikram Khan. He concluded with a beautiful thumri and a petite dadra.

 Ronu Majumdar, the worshipper of Krishna's first love, the flute, created magic with sacred sections of bamboo, including his shankh (conch) flute; reached subtle Mahiar nuances, from masses to classes! With his somniferous spells, this ace pied piper from Varanasi wove magic webs, for the music mavens -the true maestro of rustic zeitgeist and sublime nectar of pure, innovative ragas, from Abhogi Kanada to Bihag, boisterously joined on tabla by  , as the flautist brought heaven on earth. The young tabla wizard gave a taste of veer rasa in dhamar, as the two drowned the listeners in their own thunderous applause.
 
 The maestro of maestros,   with his Jog Kauns, proved that the event was not a music festival, but a Music Havana, pleasing the Gods and the listeners alike.He was ably joined on tabla by Ramdas Palsule and on harmonium by Milind Kulkarni.
