Coimbatore: Germany-based Homa Pumpenfabrik Gmbh and Coimbatore-based EKKI Group of India, which produces pumps and systems under the EKKI and Deccan Brands, have formed an international joint venture (JV). EKKI and Homa have signed a ‘definitive agreement’ to create a focused wastewater JV pump company based in India to serve India and its neighbouring markets.

 The newly-formed alliance, an equal JV between the two partners, will operate independently within the EKKI Group. The alliance will be headquartered in Coimbatore with Klaus Hoffmann, chief executive of Homa as the chairman of the board and Kanishka Arumugam, the chief executive of EKKI Group, joining as the chief executive of the JV. Vasileios Petridis and Arumugam Periasamy will also join the board of directors. “Homa plans to invest Rs 150 crore in their global expansion, a significant portion of it will be for the JV,” Hoffmann said. “We have chosen Coimbatore as an ideal location because of EKKI’s robust supply chain, skilled workforce and engineering talent,” he said. “Homa has a market presence in more than 100 countries and is one among the top-5 wastewater pump manufacturers in the worldwith a complete range, quality and technology in its segment,” Kanishka Arumugam said. 
 
 “Wastewater is a rapidly growing segment due to massive increase in demand for residential and agricultural purposes,” he said. “The JV would employ 200 persons in three years and we expect the JV to account for 40%-50% of our revenues in the next 3-4 years,” Kanishka Arumugam stated. The plant for the new JV is expected to come up in Coimbatore, he said.
