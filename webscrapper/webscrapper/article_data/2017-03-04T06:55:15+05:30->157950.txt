CHARMINAR: The commute between   and Goshamahal is turning into a hellish ride. There seems to be no plan to widen the road and on top of it haphazard parking reduces the carriageway further, leading to frequent   snarls. 

 “Traffic police personnel act as mute spectators to jams. The problem takes an ugly turn during peak hours. And traffic police seem to be eager to issue challans but do not want to take care of the real problem,’’   resident Mohammed Haji said.
 
 Locals point out that vehicles parked either way on the road to Goshamahal was one major cause for traffic jams. Some shopkeepers even park their vehicles before their shops. “Even commercial vehicles are parked along the road, which results in traffic snarls for hours,” Yusuf, an auto driver, said.
 
 Moreover, absence of traffic signals at many junctions along the route lead to more blocks. Consequently, most prefer to walk from Aghapura to Nampally, but people on bikes/cars are forced to change their routes due to traffic snarls ahead. “It has become a daily headache and it’s exhausting to wait for so long when you are struggling to reach your destination on time,’’ Shaik Saleem, another resident of the same locality, said.
 
 Cops appear to be waking up. “We want to check the menace of illegal parking which leads to frequent traffic jam between Aghapura circle and Goshamahal police stadium. We will take firm steps now,” said a senior police officer.
