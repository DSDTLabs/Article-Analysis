In a first for Indore, a new take away outlet at the   (AICTSL) bus stop, is wooing customers with an unusual USP -   loo services. Of course, Lootel (loo plus hotel) offers pocket-friendly food too. About this new venture, Surendra Soni, the CEO of   says, “Two entrepreneurs approached us with the idea of opening a cafe at the bus stand, that will offer good restroom facilities to  . Since the idea was unique, we agreed and allotted a 120 sqft space for the cafe.” 

 
 
 
 Born out of necessity (the idea came to Neelam Singh after she, like many others, faced problems finding a suitable restroom while travelling), the cafe works on the concept of ‘pay, use and redeem’. A machine installed behind the cafe dispenses washroom access receips for `10. Once you are done using the facility, you can redeem the receipt 
 
 
 
 
 The washrooms have central air conditioning and anti bacterial toilet seats. People can also make use of get ready offers, where a shower kit is provided at a minimal amount. Neelam Singh says, “The district administration allowed us to open Lootel on condition that more than 50 per cent of the area provided to us should be utilised for erecting washrooms. We’ve used 78 per cent of the area.”
 
 
 
 
 Utkarsh Patodia, an engineering student from Indore who is studying in Bhopal shares, “It’s been only six days since the cafe opened. I used the facility yesterday and the best thing about the cafe is that the facade of the cafe would never give you an impression that there is a toilet behind it. They have a proper sewage system and the cleanliness is maintained properly.” Another frequent commuter, Hemali Rathore whose in-laws stay in Sehore shares, “Women face a lot of problems to freshen up while travelling, but this facility brings an end to that.”
