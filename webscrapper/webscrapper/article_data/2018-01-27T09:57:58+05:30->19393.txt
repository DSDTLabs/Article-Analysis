Bad luck has plagued us but we are improving," Soosairaj said ahead of Saturday's match.
 
 "The mood inside the dressing room is positive. Apart from the match against East Bengal, we will be playing all our games at home. So we are looking forward to make the home advantage count," he added.
 
 Chennai City have been playing their home matches at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Coimbatore. Soosairaj had words of appreciation for the Coimbatore crowd. "The support has been terrific here in Coimbatore. Even though our name says Chennai, it doesn't matter to the people here.
