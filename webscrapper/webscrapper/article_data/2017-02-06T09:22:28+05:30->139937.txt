MYSURU: A woman, who had killed her husband in a   during a domestic quarrel at their house in   nearly a year ago, was arrested on Friday. The postmortem report, which revealed that her husband had died of injuries, nailed her.

 Following intense interrogation by police,  , who is in her early 50s, admitted to killing her husband Rajanna, 61, a security guard, in March 2016. Shanthamma, a domestic help, told   that she fatally hit Rajanna on his head with a rolling pin and a vessel in a fit of rage during mid-March in 2016. 
 
 After realizing that Rajanna was dead, Shanthamma hired an autorickshaw. On the pretext of taking her drunkard husband to hospital, Shanthamma got down at a nearby bus stop and dumped his body and returned home. When police summoned her to the mortuary to identify the body, Shanthamma remained calm and said that Rajanna may have died of excessive drinking. 
 
 Without suspecting Shanthamma then, police handed over Rajanna’s body to her after an autopsy. Rajanna’s son Basavaiah, who lived in Bengaluru, performed the last rites. 
 
 When police received the autopsy report last month, the finger of suspicion pointed towards Shanthamma, after which they started watching her activities. She was subsequently arrested on Friday. 
 
 Police inspector P P Santhosh said that based on a statement of the accused, Shanthamma committed the crime in a fit of rage. “It appears that she did not have any intention (to kill him). Shanthamma has said that the incident happened when she was preparing dinner. Rajanna succumbed to injuries and died on the spot. Fearing consequences, she shifted the body out of the house,” the inspector added.
 
 Shanthamma has been remanded to judicial custody.
