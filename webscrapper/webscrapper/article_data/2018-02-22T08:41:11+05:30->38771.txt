HYDERABAD: A ' ', in the shape of a 'diya', will be constructed near Hussainsagar to honour those who sacrificed their lives during the agitation for a separate Telangana state. 

 Chief minister   has approved the designs for the memorial. The designs were tweeted by IT and municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao on Wednesday. He said the CM's desire to keep martyrs' sacrifices eternal was reflected in the design.
 
 "The concept is developed from a traditional lamp in the form of a 'diya' to pay eternal homage to the martyrs," KT Rama Rao said.
 
 The minister said the memorial, which will be spread across three levels, will have all basic amenities for visitors. There will be a permanent museum, an audio visual hall, a convention hall for holding memorial meetings and a restaurant.
 
 However, not everyone seemed to be impressed with the design. Shashi Mangu, who studied at the  , said it seemed too conceptual and irrelevant in the context of urban fabric. He said the designs could be done a lot better and also made relevant. Many also commented that the families of the martyrs should be given financial assistance.
 
 Apart from the debate on the design, many even urged the minister to get Hussainsagar cleaned. Adaparthi, a resident, suggested that that there should be a laser show or a theatre that would show the Telangana movements and the sacrifices made for it. This should be like the one at Marina Bay in Singapore.
