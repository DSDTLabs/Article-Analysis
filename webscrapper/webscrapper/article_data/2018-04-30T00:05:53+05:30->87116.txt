 was on a Twitter break but is now back. The veteran actor said he missed all the fun and fights on the social networking site. It was just recently that the ‘Kapoor & Sons’ actor took a moment to appreciate Kishore Kumar’s music, and how! 

 Rishi took to his Twitter account and wrote, “Tu Tu Hai Wahi (Original Version)  , Asha Bhosle |The Chinese played our song to welcome PM Modi along PM Xi in Wuhan. Honored. Thank you Pancham!”
 
 Well, that was not it. Along with the fans, PM   too agreed to Rishi’s statement and even responded to his tweet. He replied, “Pancham Da is a legend in the world of music. His work continues to enthral us.”
 
 Kishore Kumar’s music is definitely something that will never fade away. Rishi later thanked Modi for he too adored Pancham Da’s music. He wrote, “Thank you Modiji. I am so happy you are on the same page as me and you recognise the impact and influence of our Indian film industry. Always make/made in India !”
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 Isn’t that adorable?
