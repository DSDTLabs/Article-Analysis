HYDERABAD: Despite the state government declaring half day session in schools from March 15, many schools are still following the old timetable and are conducting classes as per regular timings.

 Parents said education officials should initiate action to ensure that students are not forced to attend full-day sessions during peak summer. “Almost all the children in my locality have half-day at school, but my son is attending full-day session at his school. When we questioned the school management, there was no proper response,” said Raju Y, a parent whose children attend a private school in Cyberabad.
 
 Another parent   said “This has been the norm every year, but schools never follow the rules. In fact, they allow students to come in casual dress, so people assume that children are going for tuitions. More stringent rules should be brought in.”
 
 Meanwhile, the education officials said the issue has not been brought to their notice yet and assured that an inquiry will be conducted and action would be initiated against the erring schools. “CBSE schools are still conducting full-day classes as they follow a different schedule. But, the state schools should follow our rules, without any exception,” said  , district education officer, Hyderabad.
 
 School education department circular, issued on March 12, read, “Half day schools will run during summer i.e. from March 15 till last working day of academic year 2017-18. Primary, upper primary and high schools of all managements i.e. government, government aided and private management will function from 8am to 12.30pm. High schools having SSC exam centres will function from 1pm to 5pm.”
