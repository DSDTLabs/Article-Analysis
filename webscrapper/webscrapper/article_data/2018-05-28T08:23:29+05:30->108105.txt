JALANDHAR: The whistle blower of the Hoshiarpur  , in a complaint to the Prime Minister, has sought a detailed inquiry into the land acquisition deals for a National Highway by-pass in   as well.

 He alleged that the Shiromani Akali Dal leaders who were involved in the scam in   also purchased lands in Jalandhar where it was to be acquired for a National Highway by-pass. They had then applied for the change of land use (CLU) from agricultural to commercial to receive higher compensation, he added.
 
 In his complaint sent to the PMO on Saturday, RTI   founder chairman Rajiv Vaishisht has alleged that similar modus operandi was being adapted in Jalandhar by the Akali leaders and senior police officers.
 
 “Unlike Hoshiarpur where compensation for land acquisition was already distributed, in Jalandhar no compensation has been awarded and a detailed inquiry can avert such windfall gains to certain people,” Vashisht claimed.
 
 Earlier, the PMO had taken cognizance of a complaint by Vashisht and had asked Punjab additional chief secretary   to hold probe and send a report. The Punjab vigilance bureau had then investigated the matter and had booked local Akali leaders and then Hoshiarpur SDM Anand Sagar Sharma in February 2017.
 
 Vashisht had alleged that windfall gains had been made by these people in connivance with the officials by quickly purchasing lands amid acquisition process and then getting a CLU clearance to seek compensation as commercial property.
 
 Apart from the VB, the Enforcement Directorate had also registered a case in connection with the Hoshiarpur land acquisition scam.
