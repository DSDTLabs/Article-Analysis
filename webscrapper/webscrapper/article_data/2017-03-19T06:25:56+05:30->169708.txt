 By a notification issued on Wednesday the government stated that the Union ministry of health and family welfare had recently directed that admissions to medical and dental courses for the academic year 2017-18 would be centralized. Based on the guidelines, the government has decided to have a common entrance test for postgraduate medical and dental courses on lines similar to that of the undergraduate courses.
 
 Sources said that universities, deemed universities and even private colleges have been conducting their own admissions for PG medical courses. However, the new notification has put an end to all individual admissions. The new rules will also facilitate candidates as they will have to fill a single form and admissions will be on merit.
 
 The Postgraduate Medical Education (Amendment) Regulation, 2016, says that admission to all postgraduate courses (diploma/MD/MS/DM/MCh) in medical institutes in India will be conducted through common counselling, under the overall control of respective state governments. The rules mandate common counselling for PG courses as well. The new rules notified earlier by Union ministry of health and family welfare are to be implemented from the 2017-18 academic year, and will impact over 250 private medical colleges in the country.
