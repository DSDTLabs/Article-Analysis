JAIPUR: During his previous detention in the Jodhpur central jail in 2007, Bollywood actor   was into doing crunches, push-ups and having ‘chai’ with his fellow inmate  .

 Sharma, a convict, was also part of the jail band.
 
 Jail officials, who were posted at Jodhpur jail then, recalled how Khan had asked why there was only one TV for more than 100 inmates. 
 
 During interviews, he had also raised the problem of toilets as each barrack with nine inmates had only a single toilet.
 
 Describing his jail life, he had also said that ‘it was lot of fun’.
 
 “He had taken up the toilet issue. He even offered help in constructing more toilets. He was politely told that jails were like this,” recalled  , a home guard, who was posted at Jodhpur jail in 2007.
 
 A former DG (Jail), who has retired, said, “His behaviour in the jail was good. He never asked for special status or made any special demands. He had only requested to let him meet visitors from his family as per jail norms.”
 
 Other jail officials, who wished to remain anonymous, narrated a few other stories. “He had complained that he was given one steel mug which had to be used for tea, ‘daal’ as well as to take a bath,” said a senior officer of the jail department who has since retired.
