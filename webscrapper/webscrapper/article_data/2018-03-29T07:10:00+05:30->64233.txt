Ludhiana: MC has formed a committee which would take a decision on the demolition drive to remove encroachments near the Jagraon bridge. The committe was formed on Wednesday. The committee members will fix a date for the the demolition drive near the bridge so that the re-construction work of one side of the bridge could begin. The committee was formed following the deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal asking officials of both the departments to work together and start the reconstruction work as soon as possible. 

 However the decision regarding rehabilitation of the encroachers living in those houses is yet to be taken by the authorities. Additional commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal will be the chairman of this committee while joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh and assistant town planner (headquarters) SS Bindra are members. Apart from this, sub divisional officer (east) will also be part of the committee to check land records. The MC will also write to the divisional railway manager of Ferozepur division and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for appointing their representatives during demolition drive. 
 
 MC Commissioner Jaskiran Singh said the members would take a decision on the demolition of illegal structures. Talking of rehabilitation of people, he said it was difficult to say anything at the moment because the committee members would first check how many of them were staying at the place. They would be rehabilitated accordingly. 
 
 Notably, the reconstruction work of Jagraon Bridge has been on the pipeline for over two years. Initially it was the paucity of funds which kept on delaying the project and now when the railways got the money for the construction work, such issues have cropped up.
