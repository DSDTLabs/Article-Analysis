KOLKATA: Trouble seemed to plague Mohammed   on the field and off it. A senior investigator confirmed on Monday that Shami’s elder brother,  , was summoned for questioning at Lalb
 

 The police said they had earlier summoned Shami’s brother to appear at   last Saturday. But he had neither email his reply, nor did he reply through a lawyer. “We got a call where he sought more time on health grounds. We allowed him five days, considering the plea,” an officer said. “Shami’s brother has a case of rioting against him,” the police added.
 
 In her FIR, Jahan claimed she was raped at her in-law’s home at Amroha in UP, where she visited in December 2017. “I have complete faith in police,” Hasin said on Monday. The investigator, however, refused to spell out when they will question Shami. “Given that the FIR mentions serious penal charges, even non-bailable ones, it is imperative that Shami will be questioned and his statement recorded,” said a senior officer. The police have recorded Shami’s maternal uncle’s statement during their month-and-a-half-long probe at Amroha and Moradabad. In all, statements of around 12 people have been taken down. The police said they went to UP and visited the spot, where Hasin claimed the alleged crime took place.
 
 Earlier, the probe into Hasin’s allegations hit a wall in UP as she initially failed to provide any medical history to prove she was poisoned, raped or an attempt on her life was made, a top Lalbazar officer said. He added that she later handed over more details. “The hospital where she was treated did not have any record of any grievous injury. We were told it was a normal check-up. We wanted some clarifications from Hasin. The probe is on the right track,” said a senior officer.
