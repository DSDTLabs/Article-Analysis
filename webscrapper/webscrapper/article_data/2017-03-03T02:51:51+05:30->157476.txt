GURUGRAM: A brief   swept some parts of the city on Thursday, pushing the air quality index back into the ‘unhealthy’ zone after a gap of four days. 

 Environmentalists claimed that the storm, which started around noon and lasted merely 15 minutes, underlined the changing weather conditions, hinting at more stormy and dusty days ahead.
 
 After the storm, the air quality index (AQI) shot up to 253 (considered unhealthy) around 3pm, before recording a slight slide to 238 by the evening following drizzles around 4.30pm. AQI remained below the 150 mark (considered moderate) for the last four days. 
 
 In the day, the highest level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 also rose to 155.9µg/m³. The highest concentration of PM2.5 had remained below 120µg/m³ the last four days. 
 
 Environmentalists claimed rampant construction, in violation of standard norms, was the reason behind the rise in pollution.
