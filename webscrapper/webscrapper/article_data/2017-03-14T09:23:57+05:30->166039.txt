HYDERABAD: Telangana's fiscal health is not rosy with public debt mounting every year. The total debt burden now stands at 1,40,523.17 crore. According to the budget report tabled on Monday, the state is taking mammoth loans to ensure momentum in economic activity. The public debt in 2014-15 was 83,845.76 crore and Rs 93,115.16 crore in 2015-16 fiscal, but crossed 1,40,523 crore in 2017. It is expected to reach 1.8 lakh crore by end of 2018. 

 Public debts clocked a sharp 18.51% rise, which is alarming even to economists. Public borrowings stood at 1,15,243.87 crore and loans from Centre at 9,331.46 crore. Loans from autonomous bodies touched 3,866.76 crore and special securities auctioned shot up to 12,081 crore. 
 
 Despite a healthy 19.2% tax revenue mop-up, Telangana is still struggling to strike a chord with mounting expenditure. Though revenues are rising, uncontrolled expenditure has destabilized state finances.
 
 The most alarming factor is rising per capita debt burden that was pegged at 35,373.72 against per capita income of 1.43 lakh. "Every person in Telangana is carrying a debt burden of over 35,000, which is frightening," said Bhatti Vikramarka, Telangana Congress party working president. 
 
 The huge burden forced the government to cough up nearly 800 crore towards payment of interest to various financial institutions. Apart from interest, the government has to make arrangement to pay principal of these loans for which it has begun raising fresh loans. 
 
 To mobilise loans, the government has been auctioning bonds, standing as guarantor for corporations such as 26,000 crore loan to   and 12,000 crore loan for the State Housing Corporation. The very good credit rating received by the state has saved the day as financial institutions are coming forward to extend loans at low rates.
