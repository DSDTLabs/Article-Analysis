BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh State Commission for Protection of   (MPSCPCR) has decided to challenge a law that exempts aided or unaided minority schools from reserving 25% seats for socially and economically backward sections.

 According to a Supreme Court ruling, minority-run schools cannot be forced to implement the RTE Act that makes it compulsory for schools to reserve 25% seats. These include missionary schools and madarsas. 
 
 Human rights commission time and again questioned the ruling stating that it would deprive hundreds of thousands of children from quality education. But nothing has happened so far.
 
 The state commission has now decided to challenge the issue legally and bring the minority schools under the Act.
 
 “We believe that as per the definition of minorities given in the Article 28 and sub-section 3, such students should be included in 25% quota of RTE act,” said  , chairperson, MPSCPCR.
 
 The judgment by a five-judge constitution bench of Supreme Court has many loopholes on the grounds that the rights conferred on minorities under the Constitution's article 30 (1) that confers the   on all children, Sharma said.
 
 “The law needs to be revisited and we will raise this issue legally.   (NCPRC) is also taking up the issue,” Sharma told TOI.
 
 Describing the exemption for minority as “fundamentally wrong,” Sharma said it has affected lakhs of children across the state and has made them suffer on account of the decision.
 
 “It is important that the RTE Act should apply across all institutions irrespective of the faith students or institutions belong to,” he said.
 
 In Bhopal, children from socially and economically weaker sections are deprived of education in many prominent minority insitutions because of the exemption, he said.
 
 “We will appeal to the government to make it mandatory for all schools to reserve 25% of seats for economically weaker section children under the RTE Act,” the chairman stressed.
