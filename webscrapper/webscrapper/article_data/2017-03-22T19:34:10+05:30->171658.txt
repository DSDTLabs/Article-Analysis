The drought is back to haunt the state for the second year in a row, and even though many in the city feel that they are immune to it, the reality is that parts of Bengaluru are already receiving   for just a few hours, two days a week. Today is 
  , and considering the present situation, it is about time each and every one of us do our bit to ensure that we are not left high and dry.

 There are some simple means by which we can all save a lot of water every day, and these methods are not inconvenient and don’t involve huge sums of money. 
 
 Ramprasad, convener, Friends of Lakes, an informal group, says, “Living in a city, where water comes easily through a tap, many people tend to not give this resource a lot of importance, when compared to those in villages, where they have to travel long distances just to fetch water. The UN mandates that a person needs 130 litres per day, but in reality, the amount used is much higher — an average Bengalureans uses around 250-300 litres per day. People have to understand that there is unequal distribution of water in the city. Also, there is a lot of energy cost involved in getting water to your doorstep. Water is a common source and is meant for everyone — no one owns it as property.”
