AMRITSAR: To facilitate clear ‘darshan’ (view) of   in Pakistan from the border at Dera Baba Nanak in   district, Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla has announced to get four binoculars installed. He has also urged Prime Minister   to include the issue of corridor to Kartarpur Sahib in the agenda of   bilateral talks.

 Talking to TOI here on Friday, Aujla said he had given directions to procure high-end binoculars, which would be installed on the international border to help devotees to have a clear view of Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib situated in Narowal district of Pakistan across the Ravi.
 
 Founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev had reached Kartarpur Sahib after completing his four uadasis (long journeys) in 1522, and lived a simple life tilling the fields for nearly 17 years before leaving for heavenly abode in 1539. Later, a gurdwara was constructed in Kartarpur Sahib.
 
 However, during Partition, the gurdwara went to Pakistan. The gurdwara is situated barely 4km from the international border and is visible from Indian side on any clear day.
 
 Hundreds of devotees arrive at the international border in Dera Baba Nanak to offer prayers while looking towards the gurdwara. Presently, Border Security Force (BSF) facilitates devotees by allowing them to use their binoculars for a closer look of the shrine.
 
 Aujla said he would also talk to the PM Modi on the corridor issue and would urge to include the matter in the agenda of the bilateral talks.
 
 In 1999, then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf had offered Indian Sikhs to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib from Dera Baba Nanak without passport and visa. However, till date no formal proposal has been submitted to the governments.
