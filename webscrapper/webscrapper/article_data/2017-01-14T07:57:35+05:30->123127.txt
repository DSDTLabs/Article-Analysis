GUNTUR: It was lunch time on Friday when  , mother of   Vemula, the   research scholar who committed suicide on January 17 last year, called out for Raja, her younger son, to help her unwind the thread that got stuck in the spool pin of her sewing machine. “I have to deliver a stitched blouse by evening and the machine is giving me trouble,“ she said as Raja tried to fix the machine. “I took up tailoring again in December to make ends meet,“ she added.

 Radhika is not new to tailoring. She had taken it up early in her life to fund her children's education. But she gave it up after Rohith's death as she toured across the country speaking in universities and garnering solidarity for her fight against caste discrimination at higher educational institutions. A year has elapsed since then and the family is back to struggling for livelihood. She now earns `350-500 a day.
 
 “After Rohith died, we faced several hardships. Raja worked as a daily wager at Autonagar as my health wasn't good. I recovered in December and started tailoring,“ she said.
 
 The family now lives almost in an exile far from the city to avoid attention. “We were insulted by officials and members of the society . No one was willing to give us a house on rent,“ Radhika said.
 
 On Monday , it will be exactly one year since she lost her son. “Unless the ideology of the Union government and the public mindset change, there will be a lot of mothers like me who will wail in vain,“ she said.
 
 But Radhika has resolved to continue her fight for a `Rohith Act' to end casteism in universities. “Even if the   district administra tion declares Rohith as a BC, I will not let it dampen our fight. Had the people from previous generations fought against discrimination, I would have had my Rohith by my side. That is why I am fighting for future generations and to make sure no other Dalit suffers due to discrimination,“ she added.
