CHENNAI: Belgium-headquartered life sciences company   has evinced interest to pick up a controlling stake in Peepul Capital-backed diagnostics chain Medall Healthcare.

 Eurofins is said to be vying with private equity firms to acquire the privately held diagnostics service provider with significant presence in south India.
 
 Peepul Capital, which owns nearly 80% in the diagnostics chain, has called for buyers for its stake and appointed investment bank Moelis for a sale. A valuation mismatch has dragged the sale process in the past, but it has gained momentum.
 
 Blackstone Group and Everstone Capital have evaluated a transaction with Medall, though they are unlikely to be aggressive on the deal. The contours of the proposed transaction envisages the buyer picking up the 80% stake of the PE investor and allow the current management to run day-to-day operations. Text messages to Medall CEO Raju   did not evoke a response. Venkatraman acquired   in 2009 and rebranded it as Medall and started a rapid rollout. Today, the diagnostics chain — the fourth largest in India — has 176 labs across eight states.
 
 India’s fragmented diagnostics nets nearly $10 billion and is growing at nearly 8% a year on the back of rising lifestyle-related ailments. A note from   said, “Over the next three years, diagnostic services will grow at a healthy rate on account of increase in lifestyle-related diseases, rise in urbanisation, growth in disposable income, increased penetration of healthcare services and greater dependence on evidence-based treatment by doctors. The share of diagnostic chains is expected to increase as they expand rapidly based on the hub-and-spoke model.”
