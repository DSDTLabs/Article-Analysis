CHANDIGARH: Releasing one-year report card of the   government in Punjab, the state BJP unit on Friday said 430 farmers had committed suicide across the state in the last one year. Union minister and   president   said the state government had failed on all three fronts of governance, fulfillment of promises and new initiatives for social welfare.

 He said earlier the sand-transport-liquor-drug mafia ruled the roost and now it’s the goonda-tax.   said farmers were doomed, unemployed and atrocities were meted out on Dalits during the last one year.
 
 Flanked by state BJP secretary Vineet Joshi, Sampla said   had 18 lakh unemployed youth and according to an official press note of the state government, appointment letters were given to 27,000 persons in September 2017 and 9,500 in March 2018. “One can easily draw the true picture of ‘ghar-ghar rozgar’ by looking at these stats,” he said.
 
 The youths were promised smartphones but have not been provided despite making a provision in the budget. Rs 2,500 unemployment allowance was promised till one does not get a job in a family. But nothing changed on the ground, said Sampla.
