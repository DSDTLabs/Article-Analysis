PUNE: The city   have recovered unpaid fines amounting to Rs 1 crore from around 31,500   rule violators as part of a   launched on February 6. 

 The drive was started to collect the unpaid fines from traffic rule violators captured on the CCTV cameras installed at various junctions and on roads in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Since March last year, the amount of unpaid dues has escalated to Rs 19 crore.
 
 “The police teams are carrying out nakabandi and keeping a close tab on the vehicles passing through various junctions. We are randomly checking registration numbers of vehicles using the software available on our smartphones,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic)   said on Tuesday.
 
 The city traffic police have a smart control room with computers and giant screens. The personnel keep a watch on the screens and check the motorists jumping red lights at junctions or halting on zebra crossing lines. The surveillance system captures and preserves the moments of offences in the database. 
 
 The police verify the vehicles’ registration numbers. A database of cellphone numbers linked with the vehicles’ registration numbers is in place and a text message is sent to the offenders, requesting them to check the images and pay the fines at the nearest kiosks or online. The fines are collected through the e-challan system, which requires the motorists to either swipe their debit or credit cards to pay the penalty. They can also pay the   through online transactions.
 
 “The special drive had to be initiated as many motorists were not paying the penalty amounts despite receiving the text messages. We will recover all unpaid dues in the next few months,” Morale said.
