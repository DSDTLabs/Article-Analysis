CHANDIGARH: There has been no relief to the industrialists from the stink arising due to the disposal of cow dung near the factories located in Industrial Area, Phase I. 

 The staff of the cattle pond located in Industrial Area, Phase I, used to dispose of the cow dung in the vacant land which is located nearby the factories. The cow dung heaps within no time became breeding ground for mosquitoes causing health problems for the workers in the area. During a visit to the area it was found that the problem is particularly severe in front of the industrial plots numbered 701 to 709 that exist on the lane opposite the cattle pond in Industrial Area. 
 
 "Those working at the cattle ponds dump the cow dungs near the office without any consideration of our units," said  , an industrialist. He said they kept on complaining about this problem to the authorities but all in vain. Sharing about the problem he said that earlier, they used to dispose the waste on the other side of the pond. "It was only after the former mayor  's intervention that they stopped dumping there. But they have now been spoiling the area facing our units," he added.
 
 "Ever since I set up my unit in 2003, the staff of the cattle pond have been disposing of the cow dung in front of our units. Last year, two factory workers were diagnosed with dengue due to the unhygienic environment. We informed the   (MC), Health Department, but no action has been taken yet," said  , another industrialist.
 
 "Workers in our factory cannot work without applying mosquito repellent. There is an unbearable stench around the area. Chandigarh MC imposes a penalty for the water left to be stagnated in water coolers. Why can't it look after its own cattle pond?" questioned  , one of the industrialists.
 
 Owners of factory units in Industrial Area, Phase 1 have been demanding the conversion of open areas to either parks or parking units due to increased use of such areas for dumping.
