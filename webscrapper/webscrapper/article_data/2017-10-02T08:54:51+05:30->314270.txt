PUNE: Storage in the major, medium and the small dams in   was at their three-year high at the end of September following consistent rain in catchments of reservoirs during the last four months.

 On Sunday, the collective storage was 89.3% — more than 87% during the same period in 2016 and 59% in 2015. The   expects further rise in the stock as   withdrawal was yet to be over in many parts of the state. 
 
 The division, comprising Pune,  , Sangli and Satara districts, has 725 major, medium and small dams. Water resources department statistics revealed that a healthy stock in the major dams has pushed up water levels near to 90% this monsoon.
 
 The division has 35 major dams, including those in the Bhima and Krishna basins, and they are around 97% full. The storage in 50 medium dams was at 70% and the remaining 640 small dams were 35% full. Irrigation department officials said the healthy water stock in the big dams would ensure better water supply for the cities and irrigation till next monsoon.
 
 Among the 25 major dams in Bhima basin, the stock in almost 16 dams was at 100% and four reservoirs were 99% full. In the Krishna basin, the storage of four out of 13 dams stocks have reached the 100% mark and six dams were at their 99% capacity. The major dams in the Bhima and Krishna basins with maximum storage include Pavana, Panshet, Varasgaon, Mulshi, Ujani, Koyna, Radhanagari, Doodhganga.
 
 Officials said the catchments of the dams recorded wide-spread rainfall this season. “The catchments received consistent spells of rain in July, August and September. The latest rain helped increase the water levels in the downstream dams. The storage in Ujani reached the 100% mark after water was released from the reservoirs in the upstream,” an official said.
 
 The stock in 3,238 major, medium and minor projects was at 74.5% at the end of September as against 79.5% during the period in 2016. The 5% drop was mainly because of lesser stock in the dams in the Amravati and Nagpur regions.
