Nagpur: Chief judicial magistrate (CJM) DP Ragit on Thursday convicted four notorious tiger poachers involved in killing a tiger in Melghat and trading its body parts at Nagpur in 2013. Those convicted are Nirafal Chouhan, his son Shrival Chouhan, Nupustan Patle Pawar and Bandariya Chouhan. All are organized poachers belonging to the Baheliya community from Katni. This is the second conviction in two months. On October 1, 2016, woman poacher Minar Chouhan and Arjun were convicted. These two were also involved in poaching a tiger at Masondi in Ghatang range of Melghat. They also traded the skin from Amdi Fata near Ramtek. Though the four poachers have been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs50,000 and additional fine of Rs10,000 for trading skin and body parts, the poachers will be freed soon since they have already been in jail for over three years. If they do not pay the fine, then they would have to undergo additional 6 months in jail. Earlier, special counsel for forest department Kartik Shukul had successfully defended the bail applications filed by the accused. Some of the accused had even approached the Supreme Court challenging the high court decision cancelling the bail granted by the lower courts. Even before the Supreme Court, the forest department successfully defended the high courtâ€™s order. Out of the 15 accused behind bars, six have been convicted. These 15 poachers were dramatically arrested from Pune by special team of Melghat forest officials in August 2013. Investigating officer and ACF BH Virsen says 20 big and small knives, a diary contacting phone numbers of tiger skin traders, traps and incriminating material were seized from this gang. They all had confessed to the crime.
