PANCHKULA: Morning commuters of urban areas of Panchkula were stranded on Thursday morning due to an improper drainage system that led to waterlogging after the rain. 

 Local welfare associations blamed   officials who did not get road gullies cleaned well before the monsoon. Residents of various sectors, including sectors 19, 16, 12, 12A, 15, 23, 28, industrial area and major roundabouts of the city and colonies suffered from the problem of waterlogging. 
 
 Many cars were damaged and a number of two-wheeler drivers fell down due to open sewage.  , 52, a resident of Sector 15 said, “Sewage cover has been broken for the past few days. Due to this, a car got stuck, blocking traffic for some time.”
 
 Residents also pointed out that parks in the area were waterlogged, creating unhygienic conditions in the locality.  , 37, a resident of Sector 9, said, “If parks are not maintained, there will be breeding of mosquitoes causing serious diseases like dengue and malaria.”
 
 Engineering wing of Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) denied the problem of waterlogging in the city and said water drainage system of Panchkula has been 25-year-old. 
 
 According to HUDA engineering wing officials, Panchkula is located 100 feet below Himachal Pradesh. Whenever it rains, water flows fast, causing the problem of waterlogging between sectors 1 and 12. It takes half an hour for water to drain after the rain, they said. 
 
 Uneven roads and road gullies in need of repair cause accumulation of stagnant water in the internal areas, engineering officials said. 
 
 President, Citizen Welfare Association S K   said, “We have frequently submitted complaints to the deputy commissioner and municipal corporation commissioner to repair road gullies but to no avail. This was the first good rain of the monsoon and we had to face harassment all day.”
