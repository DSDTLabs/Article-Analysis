PATNA:   railway station will be handled by all   personnel on Thursday to mark the International Women’s Day.

 Danapur DRM Ranjan Prakash Thakur said around 50 women employees working at different stations under the division would be on duty at Phulwarisharif railway station. A programme has also been planned at the railway station in the afternoon to felicitate them.
 
 “The idea is to showcase women power and prove that they also can independently run a railway station,” said Thakur.
 
 He, however, admitted the dearth of women personnel in the railways, especially in Bihar. Out of the around 1,000 railway employees in Danapur division, hardly 10% are women.
 
 Thakur said there were women employees on the front desk and handling other office-related works, but there was lack of them as loco-pilot, shunting staff responsible for connecting and disconnecting different coaches, gateman or for handling other technical works. “As of now, the state does not have a single woman driver. There are six assistant loco-pilots who will be shortly promoted as drivers,” Thakur said.
 
 An officer at Danapur railway station said 55-57 trains cross the station with average 10,000-15,000 footfalls every day.
