On Saturday evening, Mumbaikars were transported to the ‘90s as Boyzone’s   and Westlife’s   performed live as a part of their Boyzlife tour. The duo’s first performance in the country saw the vocalists performing, for a little more than an hour, to hit numbers from both the bands. The attendees, all of who fell in the age group of five to fifty, enjoyed the gig singing along. 

 From Westlife’s ‘When You’re Looking Like That’, ‘My Love’ and ‘If I Let You Go’ to Boyzone’s ‘Baby Can I Hold You Tonight’, ‘Love Me For A Reason’ and ‘No Matter What’, the dudes, dressed in all-black, effortlessly rocked the night. As opposed to the carefully curated and detailed performances that one sees nowadays, it was refreshing to see the duo simply sit down and perform, walk-in and out of the stage to make dramatic appearance, and share candid anecdotes from the past. Basically, had fun like they did it in the ‘90s…
 
  
 The evening saw opening acts by electronic rock band   and singer-songwriter  . As a part of the two-city tour, Boyzlife will be performing at a concert in Bengaluru on Sunday evening.
