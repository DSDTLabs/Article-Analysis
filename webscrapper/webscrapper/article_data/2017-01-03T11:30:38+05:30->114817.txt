Panaji: Physics is losing out to engineering and medicine in Goa, director of   (NIO)   said. He was speaking at a press conference held on Monday to announce the second edition of the Science Film Festival of India (SCI-FFI). 

 “There is a sharp decline in the number of students taking up science, especially in the field of Physics. If we don’t make this field appealing to students, college departments may need to wind up,” he said.
 
 Kumar stated that societal perception is adding to the rat-race, “Physics is losing out to engineering and medicine because of the society’s perception that only these fields have high-paying jobs. There is therefore a market rush in these fields”. 
 
 He also suggested that students need to be encouraged to take up science early on, when they develop initial interest.
 
 “Many school-going students are curious about science. We must feed their curiosity at an early age and nurture that interest. Only when their interest grows, will they look at a career in science,” he said.
 
 With the aim of popularizing science among the student community,  , a science movement, will host the second edition of the Science Film Festival of India (SCI-FFI) in Goa. 
 
 The event will be held from January 17 to 20, at   (ESG), Panaji.
 
 The three-day event will feature film screenings, interactive sessions and workshops with experts and scientists with presentations on space, environment and robotics, among other subjects.
 
 The event is being held in partnership with NIO, ESG, department of science and technology, Goa, and coastal center for agriculture research, Goa.
 
 The Dev Patel-starrer, ‘The Man who Knew Infinity’, will be the opening film for the festival, while curtains will close to the 1995 American docudrama space adventure film ‘Apollo 13’.
