BHOPAL:   has been honoured with Krishi Karman Award for the year 2015-16 — the fifth time in a row. 

 Prime Minister   presented the award to chief minister   at   at New Delhi on Saturday. The award includes a trophy, a citation and Rs 2 crore. 
 
 Madhya Pradesh has been awarded in the category of wheat production of more than 10 lakh tonnes. This is the fifth time in succession that MP has received Krishi Karman Award. The State bagged the award for total food grain production in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2014-15 while for the years 2013-14 and 2015-16 the award is received in the field of production.
 
 MP has seen a massive increase in wheat production, from 73.2 lakh metric tonnes in 2004-05 to 219 lakh metric tonnes in 2016-17, beating Punjab and Haryana. Wheat productivity is now 34.13 quintal per hectare as compared to 18.21 quintal per hectare in 2004-05, said a government release. The state has recorded 18% agri growth during the last five years — the highest in the country.
 
 Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, however, wondered if the award “can be interpreted as fortunate or unfortunate for farmers of the state”. “The award comes at a time when tomatoes are being fed to cows and thrown on road as farmers are not getting a fair price. How can the CM accept an award when farmers are compelled to feed their produce to animals? In the chief minister’s home district, farmers are spending money to hire labour and pluck the tomatoes and later discard them on the highways,” Singh said.
