DUBAI:   punctuated her 6-3, 6-4 semifinal win over the battling Lativian   in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships with a service winner. 

 The 10th seeded Dane then celebrated her 1 hour 27-minute victory that took her to her second successive final in as many weeks with a fist-pump and a smile that lit the grey evening sky.
 
 The glamourous Dane, dressed in an electric blue one-piece, who last made back-to-back finals in the fall of 2014, in the US Open and Tokyo, said she was pleased with her two weeks in the Middle East, adding that the title on Saturday - against either top-seeded   or the combative seventhseed Elina Svitolina - would complete the exercise. 
 
 Wozniacki, making her seventh appearance in Dubai, where she has accumulated an enviable record, having won the title in 2011, after which she has made five semifinals, kept it tight and tidy at the start against the Lativian, who had retired from professional tennis in May 2013, due to muscular and back-related injuries.
 
 
 
 
 Everything   and   did, Olympic champs -Ekaterina Makarova and   - did better in the 76-minute semifinals. The second-seeded Russians came through 6-4, 6-3.
