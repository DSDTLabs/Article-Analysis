During discussions on the rehabilitation and resettlement of villagers, Cidco's managing director Bhushan Gagrani assured project-affected villagers that Rs 1 crore will be granted for one major temple in each of these 10 villages. Therefore, a total of Rs 10 crore will be granted for the 10 temples in these10 villages. Besides, they will also be given plots for rebuilding the temples in layouts where the villagers would be rehabilitated. The assurance was given during a meeting held on December 3 last year,“ said a Cidco official. “We will grant money to the temple committee instead of building the temples.Temples have to be rebuilt as per the norms,“ said Bhushan Gagrani, MD, Cidco. “Cidco officials faced frequent resistance over the land acquisition and in relief and resettlement of villagers whose land was being acquired.
