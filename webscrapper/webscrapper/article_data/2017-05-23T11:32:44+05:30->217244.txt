PATNA: A special court issued a warrant on Monday against former RJD MP Mohammad  , after the   cited evidence which suggested involvement of the ex-minister in the murder of journalist Rajdeo Ranjan in Siwan last year. 

 The CBI had moved a special court in Muzaffarpur and sought a production warrant against criminalturned-politician Shahabuddin, citing evidence it had found during an eight-month probe in the murder case. Shahabuddin is currently lodged in   in New Delhi after Supreme Court ordered his shifting from Bihar, to ensure fair trial of cases against him. Sources said the former MP will be produced before the Muzaffarpur special court on May 26 through video conferencing. The CBI has made him a non-FIR accused in the case. J
 
 Journalist Rajdeo Ranjan, bureau chief of a Hindi daily in Siwan district, was shot dead on May 13, 2016. After Ranjan’s wife demanded a CBI probe, the case was handed over from the district police to the central investigation agency in September 2016, on CM Nitish Kumar’s recommendation. TOI was the first to report on May 16, 2016, that the ‘order’ to kill Ranjan had come from the Siwan district jail, where Shahabuddin was then lodged. Sources said the CBI has almost completed the investigation and a final chargesheet would be filed soon. 
 
 The agency had filed the first chargesheet in December 2016 against shooter   and one Sonu Kumar, who were present at the murder spot. It is suspected that the contract to kill Ranjan was allegedly given by   to two sharpshooters, CBI sources said. The sources said Laddan Mian is considered close to politicians, including Shahabuddin.
 
 The agency has already examined a number of suspects in the case and has now sought the permission to examine Shahabuddin who is currently lodged in Tihar prison here in a separate case. The sources said two suspected sharpshooters--Mohammed Javed and Mohammed Kaif--have been questioned by the agency.
