CHENNAI: The   government has clipped the wings of chief secretary   by relieving her from the important post of commissioner of vigilance. Home secretary Niranjan Mardi has been given additional charge of vigilance portfolio.

 The order, issued a week ago, is yet to be posted on the official website. Unlike other bureaucratic reshuffles effected in the past, even the media was kept in the dark about this development.
 
 “Mardi officially took over as vigilance commissioner on Friday evening,“ said an official. The change of guard in the state vigilance wing assumes significance as it has come within days of the income tax department recommending a vi gilance inquiry into sand mining baron  's case. As per his diary recovered by the I-T de partment, many ministers, bureaucrats, MLAs and even opposition leaders had received about Rs 300 crore bribe from him for allegedly aiding him in the illegal sand mining business.
