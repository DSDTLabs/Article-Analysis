AHMEDABAD: In an incident, similar to the plot of the hit Bollywood film Drishyam, a 21-year-old third-year   student, Harsh  , attempted to extort Rs 25 lakh from a girl co-student’s businessman father, threatening to spread pictures of her bathing, taken while on a college tour.

  After Madlani sent him the pictures of his daughter on a messaging app, the businessman approached crime branch officials with a complaint.
 
 Crime branch officials apprehended Madlani, who stays in Ahmedabad for his studies.
 
 “We have recovered the photos of the girl from Madlani’s mobile phone and have booked him for blackmail and under the IT Act,” said a crime branch official.
 
 According to crime branch sources, Madlani and the girl used to study in the same college.
 
 “Some time ago, the students had gone on an college trip outside Ahmedabad. Madlani, who was friends with the girl, secretly took pictures her bathing on his mobile phone. She was totally unaware of them,” a senior crime branch official said.
 
 Madlani recently phoned the girl’s father, who has a business in  , telling him to pay him Rs 25 lakh or he would spread the photos on social media.
 
 “At first, the girl’s father refused to meet Madlani’s demands. Angry at this, Madlani then sent the photos to the businessman and repeated his demand,” added an investigator.
 
 The girl’s father then approached Ahmedabad crime branch with a complaint against Madlani.
 
 “We first probed the details of the complaint and then arrested Madlani. We are probing whether Madlani had accomplices in the blackmail attempt,” said a crime branch official.
