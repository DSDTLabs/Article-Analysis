  This is Priyanka's second award in a row and we are so proud of her.

  On receiving the award,   said, "This has been an incredible journey. Every single woman who was nominated with me today were the reason that I joined television, they were the reason that I wanted to be the actor I am here today. Receiving this award today and being in the same category as them is so overwhelming. Thank you to all of you who have accepted me and loved my show. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of Quantico, my wonderful cast and to all of you who are going to watch Quantico on Monday now. This means the world to me."
