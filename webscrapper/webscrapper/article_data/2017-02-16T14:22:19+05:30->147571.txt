 Konidela's was one of the most hyped debuts in the Tollywood industry, which resulted in a backlash. Hailing from a legendary family of the mega khandan, the host-turned-actress quite made an impact with her antics on television rather than on big screen. After Ramaraju's 'Oka Manasu' opposite Naga Shaurya, Niharika chose to wait for a proper comeback to the movie screen. 

 While she spent a long time listening to scripts, we hear that Tamil film maker Arumuga Kumar approached the girl with an impressing script. If rumour mills are to be believed, the actress is excited to play the female lead in the director's next alongside Vijay Sethupathi and Gautam Kumar. The movie will go on floors from March.
