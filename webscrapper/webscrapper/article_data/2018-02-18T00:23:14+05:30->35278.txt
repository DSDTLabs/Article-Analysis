ed:saju Coimbatore: While expressing disappointment over the Supreme Court verdict reducing the quantum of Cauvery water to be released for Tamil Nadu, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday said that certain points in the judgement should be welcomed. Talking to reporters at the airport here, Palaniswami said that the verdict was the result of a case filed by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa in the apex court. “She had requested the court to constitute the Cauvery management board and Cauvery water regulation committee. The court, on Friday, ordered the Union government to constitute the Cauvery management board and water regulation committee within six weeks,” he said. “We hope the Union government will constitute the Cauvery management board and water regulation committee soon. Our legal experts will go through the entire judgement and based on their suggestions, further action will be taken,” Palaniswami said. The Cauvery water tribunal had allocated 192tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu and reduction of 14.75tmcft and allotting 177.25tmcft to the state in the verdict was disappointing, the CM said. Asserting that the court has confirmed the acreage of Tamil Nadu coming under irrigation, he said the observation that no state can claim ownership of the river was a welcome one. From the airport, the CM left for Coonoor by road and participated in the kumbabishekam of Muthalamman Temple there. He later returned to Salem, his home town. He will return to Chennai on Sunday evening. Meanwhile, a 48-year-old two-wheeler mechanic suffered serious injuries when a cut-out erected by AIADMK workers to welcome Palaniswami on the Mettupalayam-Coonoor Road fell on him. The victim, Farook, was on the way to Coonoor from Mettupalayam on a motorcycle when the cut-out installed near Law’s Falls fell on his head. The injured man was rushed to the Coonoor Government Hospital and later to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment.
