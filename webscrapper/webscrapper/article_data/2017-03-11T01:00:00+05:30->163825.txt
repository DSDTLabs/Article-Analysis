There’s nothing like a good music session that can keep folks happy on a weekend. After a lazy Saturday afternoon, these peeps were excited about the evening jazz show at a city star hotel. The lineup for the show was also quite impressive with three kickass musicians in the city coming together — Anil Srinivasan, Krishna Kishor and Naveen Napier. The trio was at their musical best. In no time, the air was filled with jazz notes and got the guests sway in sync with the music.
