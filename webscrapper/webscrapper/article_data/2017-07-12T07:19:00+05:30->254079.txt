GREATER NOIDA: A one-and-a-half year-old boy died after   outside his house in   in   on Tuesday. 

 The child’s father, Nagendra Singh, is a sub-inspector with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and is posted at Surajpur camp.
 
 Angry family members and local residents locked the Greater Noida Authority’s office and blocked traffic at Pari Chowk, alleging negligence of authority officials. The protesters claimed they had time and again urged the authority to cover the open drain. 
 
 In June, they also tweeted about it to UP chief minister’s office and got an assurance.
 
 Around 4 pm, Aarab, who was playing outside his house —   — with other kids, slipped into the drain just as his mother went inside to attend to a phone call. “He was playing outside in rain and his mother was also around. But as soon as she went inside the house, Aarab fell into the drain,” said Saroj, a local resident.
 
 His mother searched for him after she returned and later spotted him in the drain. The toddler was smeared in muddy water and he was in a critical condition. Aarab was immediately rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 The three-feet deep open drain is just outside Affordable Housing Society, where Aarab lived with his parents and elder sister Harshita (5).
 
 A number of commuters were caught in the jam at Pari Chowk after angry residents blocked the busy intersection at Greater Noida. Senior police officials later reached the spot and pacified the protesters.
 
 “The family members alleged the mishap took place due to the negligence of local authority. They refused to get post-mortem of the deceased done. They have not filed a written complaint so far. We are investigating the matter,” said Piyush Kumar Singh, circle officer of Dadri.
