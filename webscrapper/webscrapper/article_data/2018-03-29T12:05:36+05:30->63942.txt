In an interview to TOI, city police commissioner   said that they have a strong special intelligence cell which is pro-active and extremely efficient in resolving various issues, especially communal disharmony. Excerpts from the interview:

 
 
 There is completely no truth in such statements. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, Coimbatore is one of the safest cities for children and women. We have immense public support when it comes to policing. There are just a few incidents of violence but not extremist activities. Even these have come down as we have taken action against those making hatred speech and whoever tries to disturb the communal harmony of the city
 
 
 
 We have a strong intelligence team as well. Public support to the police is immense. We get several petitions from various outfits and we try to resolve the issues then and there to ensure they do not grow into bigger problems
 
 
 
 Certain acts that have recently taken place were retaliatory in nature and they were definitely not communal. Due to certain acts in politics and certain statements, other partyâ€™s members react. This cannot be termed as extremism. People want peace and harmony. Coimbatore is growing very fast in terms of economy and such violence will only slow down its growth. People understand that and they do not want it. 
 
 
 
 All of us may have our ideologies but once we wear the uniform we are here only to serve the people. My police officers are well-trained and none of them will indulge in any act that will cause disrepute to the department. All the officers are working very hard and we have developed many community based activities to ensure that police and community work together.
