HYDERABAD: Meerpet police arrested a painter on Tuesday for allegedly blackmailing and raping a housewife of Almasguda. R Ravi, 31, of   village in   befriended the victim a decade ago when she was a Class X student at Kalwakurthy. The victim, who got married in 2014, shifted to Hyderabad. Last year,   chanced upon the victim’s cellphone number and contacted her.

 Upon recognising his voice, she snapped the phone call. Upset over this, Ravi sent nude photos and videos of her, recorded by him, when they were in a relationship. Not leaving at that, Ravi called her again and threatened to share the photos with her husband.
 
 When she blocked his number, Ravi called her from another number and demanded money. “To save her marriage, the victim gave him Rs 2.5 lakh cash,” a police official said.
 
 The last straw was on January 18 when Ravi called her to a deserted place in Kalwakurthy with a promise to delete the nude photos. He, however, dragged her into nearby bushes and raped her. “As his torture continued, the victim finally lodged a complaint with us,” LB Nagar DCP M   said.
