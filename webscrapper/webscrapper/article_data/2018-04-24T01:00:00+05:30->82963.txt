Hansal Mehta’s upcoming film, 'Omertà', is a true story of one of the most dreaded terrorists —   Saeed Sheikh— of our times. What makes his story even more chilling is the fact that Omar has a strong connection with India. 

 In December 1999, when   A300 flight IC 814, which was on its way from Kathmandu to Delhi, was hijacked and taken to Kandahar ( ), the hijackers had demanded the release of three hard-core terrorists in exchange for the hostages’ freedom. Among the three was British-born Pakistani terrorist, Omar. He was lodged in Tihar Jail at the time of the hijack, held for the kidnapping of four foreign tourists in Delhi.
 
  says, “I first heard about Omar Sheikh during the hijack incident. He became more brazen after his return to Pakistan. What makes me angry is the impunity with which he operated, with the patronage and support of the Pakistani establishment . Omar Sheikh is a living example of how state-sponsored terror operates. He is a diabolical man, who continues to pull strings from inside his prison cell in Pakistan. I want Omertà to expose this unholy nexus.” 
 
 Shot in real locations across London and India, the movie, written by Hansal Mehta and  , has been woven around many terror strikes, including 9/11, 26/11 and the brutal beheading of American journalist  . While   plays Omar, the film features Timothy Ryan Hickrnell, Kewal Arora and Rajesh Tailang in pivotal roles. 
 
 'Omertà', presented by Swiss Entertainment and Karma Media, and produced by Nahid Khan, releases on May 4.
