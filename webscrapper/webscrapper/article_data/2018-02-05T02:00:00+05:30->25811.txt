PATNA: Nationalist   Party (NCP) general secretary and party’s Katihar MP   on Sunday said BJP’s loss in two   seats and an assembly seat in Rajasthan byelections proved that PM   was losing his hold on masses in the country.

 “Till recently, the PM enjoyed charismatic hold on masses. It is clear from the results of byelections to three seats in Rajasthan that the ‘Modi magic’ has lost its lustre,”   said.
 
 Tariq, who was accompanied by party’s spokesman Anil Kishore Jha and another party functionary Sunil Singh, said constituents of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) have started charting their own courses. “First it was   in Maharashtra that got annoyed with the BJP. Now, even the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) led by Andhra CM Chandra Babu Nayadu has started threatening to quit the NDA. Few other political parties will also follow the suit soon,” Tariq said.
 
 Asked if CM Nitish Kumar would like to opt for the simultaneous parliamentary and assembly elections in Bihar, Tariq said, “If it happens, the NCP will welcome it.” “There is nothing unusual about it. Former PM Indira Gandhi decided for parliamentary election in 1971 before schedule, and former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee opted for elections six months in advance in 2004,” Tariq said.
 
 However, to hold simultaneous parliamentary and assembly elections in the country, all the state governments and political parties have to be taken on board, besides making constitutional amendment to facilitate it, Tariq added.
 
 He said the opposition parties are united, as UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi held a meeting of 17 parties last week. “Even in Bihar, there is strong probability of the RJD, Congress, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party led by Union minister Upendra Kushwaha, NCP and former Speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary coming together,” he added.
