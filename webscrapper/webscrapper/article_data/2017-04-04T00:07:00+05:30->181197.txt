Indore: The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court on Monday heard appeals filed by city-based schools that challenged a previous order by the high court approving admissions under the   to children below six years of age.

 Since a special leave petition filed regarding the same matter is pending before the Supreme Court, the division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice Virendra Singh listed the appeals for further hearing in May. The petition at the apex court and the writ appeal at the high court have been filed by schools against the order passed by Justice Prakash Shrivastava, who in his judgement upheld private unaided schools, which provided pre-school education, were required to give admission to children belonging to weaker sections of society through at least 25 percent seats in pre-school classes.
 
 The court approved of the state government’s circular dated January 16, 2013 asking schools to comply by RTE norms for pre-school students and the show cause notice issued on August 28, 2013.
 
 According to petitioners, the RTE act mandated that children belonging to weaker sections of society and between the age groups of six and 14 years, should be given admission to minimum 25 percent of the seats in schools.
 
 “The RTE act provides for admission of children from weaker sections from Classes I to VIII. But the state government through its circular mandated the schools to grant at least 25 percent admission in pre-school classes as well. We have challenged this circular by the state’s school education department,” Gaurav Chhabra, counsel representing the schools said.
