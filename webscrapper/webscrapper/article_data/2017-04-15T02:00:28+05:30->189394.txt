NEW DELHI: Citing the findings of a recent report of the   (CVC), deputy chief minister   said on Friday that the   had reduced corruption in Delhi significantly between 2015 and 2016.

 “The report, tabled in Parliament, states that while CVC received 5,139 cases of corruption from the public against   departments in 2015, the same dropped to 969 in 2016. This is a sharp decline of over 81% in a period of just one year,” Sisodia said. “This decline has happened despite the fact that the Delhi government’s Anti-Corruption Bureau was made defunct in June 2015 by the Union government,” he asserted.
 
 Earlier, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had posted the findings as reported in the media to reinforce the same point. 
 
 Sisodia emphasised that the AAP government had “displayed a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption over the last two years”. He added, “AAP has been strict even within the party, as was evident when the chief minister sacked a minister when evidence of corruption was found against him. The AAP government has also eliminated corruption by using technology and brought in transparency in the way various departments operate.” 
 
 From school admissions to awarding big contracts, the regime of nexus and bribery has come to an end, the deputy CM claimed. The government has used schemes like e-district to “eliminate the potential for petty corruption in lower levels of the government”. 
 
 The same CVC report also states that the complaints of corruption against various departments of the Union government have risen by 67%, Sisodia said. This shows the stark difference between the way the two governments have functioned over the past one year, he added.
