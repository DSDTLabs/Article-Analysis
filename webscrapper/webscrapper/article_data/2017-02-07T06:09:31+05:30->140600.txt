PATNA: Security personnel got into a tizzy as an explosion took place on the   between Jaso and Nadaon villages, 3.5km from   railway station, around 12.30pm on Monday.

 The 13134 Dn Varanasi-Sealdah Upper India Express was crossing the the spot when the explosion took place on the Down track. “The locomotive and at least three coaches had crossed the explosion site when a junior engineer (permanent way) of the railways, inspecting the track nearby, spotted wisps of smoke at the track.
 
 Railway employees swung into action and stopped the train by waving red flags to the driver. 
 
 Patna superintendent of rail police (SRP) Jitendra Mishra told TOI over phone from the spot it was yet not clear if the explosive was planted and exploded due to pressure or was thrown at the track. An FIR has been lodged at the Buxar government rail police station, 110km east from Patna.
 
 The SRP said the train was thoroughly searched by security personnel before it proceeded for its onward journey. “Forensic experts from Patna have collected some explosive substance from the track for investigations,” he said, adding the track was not damaged but the train movement had to be stopped for a couple of hours on the Down track following the explosion.
 
 An explosive expert of the Bihar Police’s ATS (anti-terrorism squad) said the yellow substance collected from the track appeared to be a mixture of sulphur, magnesium and chemicals. “It indicates a countrymade bomb was used in the explosion,” he said, preferring anonymity.
