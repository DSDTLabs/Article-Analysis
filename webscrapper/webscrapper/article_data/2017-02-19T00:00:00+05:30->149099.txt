Why? Because nail artistes have started a new   — textured nails, with the swirly horn that distinguishes a unicorn’s forehead being an integral part of this daring look. The horn design, made of durable acrylic or gel polish and holographic powder, is generally paired with manis involving stiletto-shaped   with glittery, iridescent polish. The look requires some incredibly skillful and creative nail artistry, along with devotion, so if you want to sport it, take out a few hours and head to a nail bar. "These nails are for the experimental women. Though they look bold, I doubt if they can be sported on a daily basis, because of the time and effort taken to create the look. Maintaining the nails will also be an issue," nail expert Shikha Sridhar said.
We are sure unicorns will approve of this look!
