Vadodara: An eight-foot-long crocodile ventured into the Ajwa Garden that is located about 20km from the city on Tuesday morning. 

 The crocodile was spotted by the locals following which they informed the forest officials. The reptile, it seems, came from Ajwa Lake nearby. 
 
 The garden is popular among citizens who frequent it in big numbers on weekends. Forest officials rushed to the spot and caught the reptile with the help of some volunteers. The crocodile was then released in the lake. 
 
 This is the second time that a crocodile ventured into the garden. A crocodile had ventured into the garden where a fountain was being repaired some weeks ago. The Ajwa Lake is home to lot of crocodiles that sometimes venture out of the waterbody.
