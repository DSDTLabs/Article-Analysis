MADURAI: The Alaganallur boys higher secondary school, started in the year 1952, has got a gleaming modern building in place of a dilapidated structure that stood there thanks to the contributions of old students. Opened by district collector   on Thursday, the effort was unique in that some of the work was undertaken by the alumni members themselves.

 Pon Kumar, a member of the school alumni organisation, said that they had decided to do something for their school in September last year. “We found the old building in bad shape and unused and hence decided to renovate, it,’’ he said. A WhatsApp group of old students was started with as many as 200 joining it. In all, 108 members came forward to donate a minimum of Rs 1,000 each, collecting as much as Rs 7 lakh in a short span,’’ he said.
 
 Much of the building was renovated by the old students themselves who pitched in with their expertise and time.   and   who passed out in 2000 took care of the structural aspects while Manikandan from the 1994 batch did the false ceiling. Ramakrishnan took care of the painting and Gopi, also an old student, did the wiring.“We were able to save 40 per cent on the renovation work as we did the work ourselves,’’ said the old students who felt proud when the district collector inaugurated the building.
 
 They have not specified to the school headmaster as to how the building should be used — whether it could be a good meeting hall or a huge interactive classroom. ``Whatever it may be we are very happy with the results,’’they said. The old students said that they never ever thought that such efforts could be made possible in a short span of time. This has encouraged them to collect money and help poor students from the school pursue higher education.
