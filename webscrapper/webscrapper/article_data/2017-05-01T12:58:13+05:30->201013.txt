BHOPAL: Amidst talks of ‘sharab bandi’ and ongoing agitations against liquor shops, an illegal country made   was unearthed in Morena on Saturday. A man was arrested but his son and brother managed to escape from the huge haveli situated in Alapur village of the district’s Joura tehsil after a police team conducted a raid.

 The huge haveli with 10 doors is spread on an acre of land.
 
 When armed cops raided the haveli after a tip-off, building owner Rakesh Kirar and his nephew Monu escaped from one of the doors. However, Monu’s father Phool Singh could not run away as he had a fractured limb and was arrested.
 
 Morena superintendent of police Vineet Khanna said huge quantity of over proof or OP — concentrated alcohol in layman’s term — and   liquor along with a large quantity of empty bottles and packing machines were seized from the basement of the haveli.
 
 He said investigations are on to find the supplier of OP. “ We want to break the whole network involved in running the factory. This includes OP suppliers and distributors. Police teams have been formed to nab Rakesh and Monu,” he said.
 
 “ Phool Singh was booked under 34/ 2 of Excise Act, produced in court and sent to judicial remand,” he said. The SP denied that the factory has anything to do with the recent rise in smuggling after shops were closed following anti-liquor agitations.
 
 In wake of the demonstrations, liquor contractors of Morena district had submitted a memorandum to the district collector demanding their margin money back and also offering to surrender their licence. Some shops have not been able to open for the past one month.
