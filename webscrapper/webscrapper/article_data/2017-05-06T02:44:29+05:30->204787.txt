SRINAGAR: A video showing two youths being tortured and their hair being shaved by terrorists went viral across   on Friday. The two youths were tortured and humiliated by   terrorists after being branded as   in the video. 

 The video has sent a fresh wave of terror across Kashmir Valley among young boys seeking police jobs. The two youths, according to the video, acted as police informers to get jobs as SPOs.
 
 The seven-minute video, which surfaced on social networking sites despite a government ban, starts with the Hizb's name and insignia scrolling on the screen. It then shows a dark room in which militants are shaving the head of a man pleading with them with folded hands for mercy.
 
 "Breaking news: Asalamualaikum: ye wo gaddar hai jo police mai SPO bharti hone ke liye mujahideen ki khabar Hindustani kutton ko detey hain (They are those traitors who provide information about militants to Indian dogs for getting jobs in the police as SPOs)," a ticker running below the video reads. 
 
 The video also shows the militants thrashing another man with sticks and forcing his head into a bucket of water. Of late, the militants have been releasing videos of their activities to create fear among people so that they don't cooperate with the security agencies. Most of these videos, according to police, have been shot in south Kashmir.
