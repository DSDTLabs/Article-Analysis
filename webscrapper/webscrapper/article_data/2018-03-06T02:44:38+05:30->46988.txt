 Damodar Tandel,   president, said the state claims to have received all 12 no-objection certificates, but they were conditional and given when the memorial was planned to be 192m tall. Now, the project has been revised to erect a 210m memorial. “The government must seek fresh NOCs as the project has been changed,” said Tandel. He also pointed out that though their case is pending in the National Green Tribunal, the state allotted the contract to L&T. 
 
  Pradip Patade, a co-petitioner, said the site is not an outcrop, but a marshy area with corals and a rich marine habitat. “In the right season, there are at least 50 boats near the site fishing for lobsters,” he said. tnn
