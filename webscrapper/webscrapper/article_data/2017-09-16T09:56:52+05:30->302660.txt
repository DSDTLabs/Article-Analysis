UDAIPUR:   can start feeling a little less guilty about the amount of garbage they throw away. Soon, the   would be processed and turned into fuel.

 An MoU has been inked between the municipal council and Wonder Cement. As per the agreement, the municipal council would arrange door-to-door garbage collection, waste segregation and finally would transport the dry and plastic trash to the cement company’s plant at Nimbahera where the endless stream of garbage would be incinerated to create energy.
 
 “The primary environmental benefit of solid waste fuel comes from the reductions in landfill emissions and fossil fuel use. We are already processing the wet waste to make organic fertilizer and now taking a step ahead, recyclables like paper and metals would be separated out. The rest would be sent to the cement factory where it would be burned,” Kamlesh Doshi, the chairman of the municipal council said.
 
 “It is a huge step for Pratapgarh towards a better environment and we hope in the future to launch the initiate in other towns too,” said Collector Neha Giri.
 
 Incineration stands for a type of waste treatment process where the organics from the waste collected are burnt at high temperatures. Waste treatments that are conducted involving high temperatures are thermal treatment and the heat generated from this thermal temperature is then used to create energy.
