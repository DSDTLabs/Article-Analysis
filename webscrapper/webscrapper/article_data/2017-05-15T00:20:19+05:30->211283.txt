Chennai: A week after a seven-member gang hijacked a van carrying 26 barrels of medicine worth Rs 2 crore after attacking the driver and an armed security guard accompanying him, near Kancheepuram, police on Sunday arrested all the members of the group.

 The arrested were identified as Satheesh Kumar alias Mani, 30, of Ranipet, Ganesan, 35 of Tondiarpet, Jayakumar, 24 of Avadi, Ammanullah, 30, of Padappai, Palani, 25, and Ravikumar, 26, of Saidapet and Saravanan, 35, who is now in Vellore prison.
 
 Driver Sekar and an security guard Venkatesan were transporting the medicine from a pharmaceutical company’s production facility in Ranipet, Vellore, to the company’s office in Alandur.
 
 When the vehicle neared Sunguvarchatram bypass on the Bengaluru-Chennai highway, the gang in an SUV intercepted the truck.
 
 Police who suspected the insider’s hand in the incident found the involvement of one driver of the company, Satheeshkumar.
 
 He told the police he learnt that the asthma drugs served a good component in manufacturing narcotic substance. He told the gang about the route and the truck’s registration number, police said.
 
 “The medicine contains pseudoephedrine, one of the chemicals frequently used in the manufacture of illicit narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance,” said an investigating officer. Saravanan, a convict lodged in Vellore prison, was friend of Satheesh, who helped him providing the gang to execute the robbery.
 
 “Another gang used similar modus operandi and escaped with drugs from the same company in 2014,” said Kancheepuram SP Santhosh Hadimani.
