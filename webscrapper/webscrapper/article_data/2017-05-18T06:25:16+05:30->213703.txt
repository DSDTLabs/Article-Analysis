NAVI MUMBAI: A 58-year-old man, Umakant Manjrekar, went all the way to   police station to hand over a purse containing an iPhone, Rs 10,000 cash, and a debit card that he had found on   on Tuesday evening. Manjrekar, a Nerul resident, works as a commission agent for a courier company. 

 The purse was returned to its owner, Preeti Khandelwal (37), a   resident . Khandelwal, who hails from Indore and recently shifted to Belapur from Singapore, said the purse was dropped on the road by her seven -year-old daughter.
 
 "Around 4pm, I went out to buy milk with my daughter on my bike. She was riding pillion and was holding my purse. When we reached the milk centre, almost 5 km from my place, I realized that my daughter had dropped my purse. We returned along the same road but could not find it. I asked my brother-in-law to call up on my phone and it was answered by a cop from Nerul police station. The cop told him that the phone was found in a purse by a man. We reached the police station and met the man."
 
 Manjrekar said, "When I found the purse, I waited for some time for the owner to come looking for it. But I was getting late, so I deposited it at Nerul police station. The cops noted my details and allowed me to leave. After 15 minutes, I received a call from the purse owner. She insisted on meeting me"
