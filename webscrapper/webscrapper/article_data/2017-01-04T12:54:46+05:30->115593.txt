NAGPUR: Four-wheeler drivers in Nagpur have earned the dubious distinction of being involved in most road accidents — 410 — of the total 1,373 mishaps in 2016, followed by two-wheeler riders in 394 incidents and trucks accounting for 217 accidents.

 In 2016, as many as 310 persons died in road accidents which mainly included 141 two-wheeler riders, 92 pedestrians and 21 bicycle riders. The number of two-wheeler riders (141) killed in mishaps in 2016 raises eyebrows as the fatalities exceed the number of casualties in 2015. The city traffic police had launched a massive drive against   in 2015, yet 125 two-wheeler helmetless riders had died in mishaps. The traffic police penalized over 2 lakh helmetless riders in 2016 as against 192 in 2015, the statistics of the city traffic police revealed.
 
 Road accidents involving two-wheeler riders have been on the rise in the city. Most accidents were owing to speeding and reckless driving, and all the victims were not wearing helmets, traffic police sources said. Data shows that from January 2010 to December 2016, the city witnessed 2,995 deaths in road accidents, of which two-wheeler riders accounted for 606 deaths.
 
 Despite having wide roads, nothing has changed for the city’s motorists. In fact, wider roads have become unsafe as motorists often indulge in rash and reckless driving. This can be gauged from the 159 accidents recorded on the   alone in 2016. According to statistics, in 2016, the city roads witnessed as many as 291 fatal accidents, 553 serious and 529 minor mishaps.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic),  , claimed that many two-wheeler riders sustain head injuries, but even then there seems to be no eagerness on the part of riders to wear helmets. “They don’t realize that they were risking their own life,” she said.
 
 On the other hand, the number of traffic violations too has increased. In 2016, the traffic police penalized 5.15 lakh vehicle riders for violating traffic rules, the data revealed. In 2015, the figure was 3.56 lakh.
 
 The traffic police admitted that the revised fine has failed to deter errant motorists. Patil also claimed that traffic police personnel were not falling short on the enforcement part. The revision in fine has increased the revenue for the state exchequer, she added.
 
 Activists also pointed out that citizens too lacked self-discipline in following traffic rules. Traffic expert   said people should themselves stop flouting rules and adhere to the law, regardless of the presence of traffic policemen.
