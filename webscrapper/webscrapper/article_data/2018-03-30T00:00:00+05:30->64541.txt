When we caught up with Mohan   recently, we were surprised to see him sporting a salt-and-pepper bearded look. The director told us he has been growing a beard for the past couple of months and this avatar is all thanks to his kids.

 Raja, whose last film was Velaikkaran with  , said, “When I start shooting, I usually don’t bother shaving, and I let the beard grow. But during promotions, I prefer to have a clean-shaven look because I want to look presentable in front of the audience. But, after I finished work on Velaikkaran, and was gearing up for its promotions, my kids told me that I should meet the press and people the way I was. My daughter said she loved me in this avatar and my son told me I look very ‘gentlemanly’. I don’t pay much attention to grooming, and I guess I have been lucky that my beard is salt-and-pepper naturally.”
