Panaji: The state government is keen to create an online single-window clearance system, along the lines of the Singapore government investment model, to improve the ease of doing business in Goa, said director of industries, Rajaprabhu Menaka.  Menaka was speaking at the recently held annual day celebration of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Menaka said that despite scarce resources, Goa offered tremendous opportunities for industrial development and that the state government was exploring various models to promote industrial activity in the state. “The ultimate aim is to have an online single-window clearance system so that there is less interface between industry and the government. This is something that we all have to work towards” said Menaka while addressing captains of Goa’s industry. Menaka, who previously served as the Deputy Commissioner of North & Middle Andaman in Andaman and Nicobar Islands said that the Goa government was open to review the current Goa Investment Promotion and Facilitation Policy if required.  “Employment and balanced growth can be looked at. Maybe it is time to have a relook at the policy, to review the schemes on offer and if required, bring out new schemes,” the IAS officer said while speaking a day before the state assembly elections were declared. Outgoing CII chairman, Shekhar Sardessai said that CII was open to work with any government but was keen on improving the manner in which bureaucratic approvals were given. “CII would take charge and work with the government to push and focus on improving the ease of doing business ranking in Goa for the next two years,” Sardessai said. Dempo Group head Srinivas Dempo, on his part, said that creating adequate number of employment opportunities was a big challenge for the next government.
