 Singhal said efforts were being made for ensuring citizen-centric policing, bringing transparency in the functioning of the police and fixing accountability on officers.
 
 “The state government has appointed me as nodal officer to monitor conviction rate in the state and ensure speedy trials in several cases,” Singhal said, adding conviction is a major tool for inducing fear among criminals.
