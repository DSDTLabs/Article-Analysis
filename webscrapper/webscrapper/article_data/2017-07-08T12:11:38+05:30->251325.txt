It’s sort of become a trend to rope in either Mammootty or   to give narration for Mollywood films, of late. Most recently, Mohanlal lent his voice to Prithviraj’s latest movie  .

 The actor is the “voice of time” in the socio-political drama, which is set in a village in North India. The story spans several time periods and hence the superstar’s voice serves as a connection to the different narratives of the tale.
 
 Incidentally,   and the movie’s scriptwriter   will be collaborating with the superstar in  . The film will mark Prithviraj’s directorial debut and will go on floors by mid 2018.
