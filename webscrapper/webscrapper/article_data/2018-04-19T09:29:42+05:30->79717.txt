 I’ve been in politics since 1996 after my father moved away from here and told me this is my constituency and I should nurture it. I’ve learned from my father that elections should be fought on issues and one should not make it personal. Political fights should be on ideological lines, not against individuals. I intend on practising gentleman politics.
 
 
 
  has ruined the constituency by misusing our father’s name and government policies. He practises vengeance politics and continues to remain in the past. There’s also a major allegation against him that he sold bagair hukum land of farmers to some agents. As many as 25,000 applications of farmers seeking rights to bagair hukum land have been rejected as the land was sold.
 
 
 
 It’s a combination of the name and my capabilities. There’s a lot of goodwill in BJP for the Bangarappa name, as the party grew from 39 seats to 79 seats in the state under my father’s stewardship. Besides, I have experience in politics and administration.
