CHENNAI: A footpath project by the highways department in   has drawn criticism from residents, who feel jinxed by a slew of   problems. The design of the walking space almost blocks entry into houses and may increase the risk of flooding for houses. 

 The highways department began work on the footpath on  , situated in Zone 12 (Alandur) of the  , last Wednesday.
 
 According to residents, traffic congestion in the area had increased manifold in recent years. Commercial establishments have encroached on the existing and the corporation and police turn a blind eye. Residents complained that pedestrian safety is a huge problem in the locality.
 
 However, the approach of the highways department, which is laying a footpath with a clearance of nearly one foot from the road surface, has been censured by residents. "Entry to our homes is blocked. We won't be able to take our vehicles in or out," said D  , a resident. He says the design will encourage residents to build illegal ramps extending on to the road.
 
 V Rama Rao, social activist and a resident, said the highways department did not consult the local community about the project. "With the rise in height, entry to the existing storm water drain will be covered. In case of a heavy rainfall, the locality will witness increased flooding," he said.
 
 Recently, the highways department also relaid 1st, 4th and 6th main roads in Nanganallur without cold milling (removing) the top surface.
 
 "There is no provision for us to mill the top layer," a contractor relaying 6th Main Road said. Highways department officials were not available for comment.
