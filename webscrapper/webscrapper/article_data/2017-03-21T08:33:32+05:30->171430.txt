MUMBAI: There has been a   in industrial growth despite the  , reveals the state’s economic survey for 2016-17. One of the main reasons is the one percentage point decline in manufacturing.

 The manufacturing sector makes the biggest contribution to industrial growth—over 20%—and accounts for a sizeable share in employment generation. Apart from manufacturing, the  , and   and quarrying sectors are also on a downswing, the survey shows. Several critics have linked the decline to demonetisation.
 
 The decline is an embarrassment for the   government which has implemented several steps to boost the ease of doing business.
 
 Growth rate for the overall industrial sector is set to dip to 6.7% in 2016-17 from 7.5% in 2015-16. And within this segment, growth rate for manufacturing is set to decline to 8.4% from 9.3%. Construction is also expected to see a sharp drop to 2.8% from 4.3% while growth rate for mining and quarrying is set to slide from 4.3% to 0.5%.
 
  has a 33.8% share in Maharashtra’s overall economy, services has 54.4% share while agriculture and allied activities have an 11.8% share. Within industry, manufacturing contributes 21.7% to value of output, the mining and quarrying sector has a 3.7% share, while construction has a 6% share.
 
 “Small and medium scale industries faced a major decline in demand as a result of demonetisation. There was barely any market for their products,” said Congress’s Ratnakar Mahajan, former chairman of the state planning board. “The construction sector also saw a fall in demand. Since contractors were unable to pay workers, construction sites remained incomplete,” he added.
 
 However, others like Mumbai University economist Neeraj Hatekar do not agree. “The construction sector has been in a slump since 2012. And manufacturing has not been doing well for a while. There is no clear link to demonetisation,” he said.
