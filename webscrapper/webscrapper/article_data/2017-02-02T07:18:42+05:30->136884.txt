CHENNAI: In a sign of growing camaraderie between chief minister   and the  , senior DMK leader S Duraimurugan on Wednesday said he would like Panneerselvam to continue as CM for the next five years. “Beware of those around you (party colleagues). We won't do any harm to you,“ Duraimurugan told OPS, amid cheers from his party MLAs in the assembly.

 Intervening in the debate on the governor's address, Duraimurugan said, “We don't have any objections (on Panneerselvam continuing as CM).“ Duraimurugan's intervention may well have embarassed AIADMK MLAs who had until recently batted for party general secretary   becoming chief minister. Many of them had declared that the leadership of the party and the government must be in the hands of one person. Going against recent practice, DMK members participated in   and the   presided over by Panneerselvam in Chennai last week. Jayalalithaa's trusted lieutenant and the DMK camp seem to respect each other. This has been evident in the House, with Stalin and his MLAs greeting the CM, which was a rarity in the past. In the assembly, Panneerselvam, soon after referring to DMK chief M Karunanidhi by name, corrected himself and asked the Chair to change the reference to DMK party leader, after DMK members objected.
 
 In contrast, political observers point to the DMK leadership chosing not to give importance to accusations levelled by Sasikala and her husband, Natarajan, on jallikattu and Marina protests. The party chose to respond to their allegations through second rung leaders, indicating that they did not respect the AIADMK's new leadership.
