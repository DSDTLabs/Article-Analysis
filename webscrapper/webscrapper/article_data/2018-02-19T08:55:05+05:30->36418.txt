HYDERABAD: In a significant development, Hyderabad police have sent a notice to   director   seeking an explanation from him about alleged objectionable lyrics of a song in his film ' Odu Adaar Love ', in which actor Priya Prakash Varrier’s wink became an internet sensation.

 The notice, which was posted on Saturday, was served by the   police as a case was registered on February 14 based on a complainant from locals. They alleged that the lyrics of the song ‘Manikya Malarayi Poovi’ had reference to the life of the Prophet.
 
  
  
 
 “As per the notice, which was served under section 160 of CrPC, the director has been asked to give explanation in 15 days. The notice was sent by post . Another team from Falaknuma police station will also leave for   to physically hand over the notice to the director,’’ credible sources in Hyderabad police told TOI.
 
 Based on the explanation by Lulu, Hyderabad police would take a decision whether to drop the case or issue another notice under 41 CrPC, a notice which would be issued to an accused, if the explanation is unsatisfactory.
 
 Priya Varrier’s wink might have won millions of hearts, but some persons approached the south zone police a few days ago with another complaint, seeking action against the actress , director, producer, lyrist and others associated with the movie over the alleged objectionable song. However, police did not register an FIR on this complaint since the Falaknuma police had already registered a case against the director. A general diary (GD) entry was made.
 
 Falaknuma police have registered the case against director Omar Lulu under Section 295A of IPC, which deals with deliberately hurting religious sentiments.
 
 Reacting to the case, the director has already clarified that the song “will not be removed from YouTube and the movie as well as it has been a popular song in Kerala since the late 1970s”.
