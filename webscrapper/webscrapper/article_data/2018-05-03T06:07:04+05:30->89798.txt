MUMBAI: Within a span of 36 hours, families of three men who were declared brain dead in different hospitals donated their organs and saved eight lives, said   (Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre) officials on Wednesday. "Beginning 3am on May 1, we got three deceased donors," said ZTCC secretary general Dr S K  . 

 While one of the donors was a 22-year-old man who suffered head injury in a road accident, the other two -- a 67-year-old and 45-year-old man -- suffered intracranial bleeding that led to brain death.
  
  
  With these donations, the city has managed 18 cadaveric donations so far this year. While 21 families consented to donate their loved one's organs this year, three couldn't due to some medical or technical reasons. These donations benefitted 28 patients with kidney failure, 17 with liver failure and seven with heart failure, said Dr Mathur. 
 
 In 2017, Mumbai had 58 organ donors, a huge improvement over single-digit donations till 2012.
 
 ZTCC president Dr Gustad Daver said, "The efforts we put over almost two decades are paying off. There were not only awareness drives, but hospitals also worked together to improve the situation. More needs to be done, though."
 
  In the first donation on May 1, the family of a 22-year-old man donated his heart, liver and two kidneys at   in  . In the second donation at Saifee Hospital in  , the family of a 45-year-old man consented to donate his liver and two kidneys. In the third instance, a family donated its 67-year-old patient's liver at Jaslok Hospital, Peddar Road.
