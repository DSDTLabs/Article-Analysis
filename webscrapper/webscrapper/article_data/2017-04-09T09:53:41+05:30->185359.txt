 Even the ruling Congress dismissed rumours of Sangma joining BJP. The party said Sangma has said a number of times that he is a traditional Congress man.
 
 Senior cabinet minister and Congress leader   said, "I have never heard of Sangma offering himself to BJP." Another senior Congress leader, who did not wish to be named, said Sangma was instrumental in unifying the otherwise faction-ridden Congress.
