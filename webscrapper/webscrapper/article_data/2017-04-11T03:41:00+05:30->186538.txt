Panaji: At a time when opposition to the proposed information technology park at Chimbel keeps surfacing, a few youth from the village have come out in support of the project. Besides employment opportunities, the youth have another reason to support the project - eradication of slums. Four Chimbel youth have put up a petition on change.org seeking support for the IT Park and to try and draw the attention of the chief minister. The campaign has found support from just over hundred people.  “Chimbel has always been known for bad things such as crimes or the slums. This is an opportunity for us to change this identity,” says Swapnesh Mangaonkar, who started the petition a week ago. In December 2015, then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar unveiled the Goa IT Policy in a bid to attract electronic manufacturing and software companies to Goa. Along with the electronic system design and manufacturing hub at Tuem, the government had also proposed an IT park at Chimbel which is barely four kilometres from state capital, Panaji.  At a recent gram sabha in the village, a resolution was taken to urge chief minister Manohar Parrikar to shift the IT Park out of the Chimbel. “This should have been welcomed by the entire state and more so by Chimbel villagers. It is unfortunate and shocking to see such a project facing opposition from people who are sure to benefit from it. We want to make the government aware that there are some people who are positive about the IT Park,” Mangaonkar, a mechanical engineer, said. His campaign is supported by friends Rakesh Kandolkar, Tushar Verdekar and Anurag Verdekar. The youth argue that the IT Park will help in job creation, not just for IT students, but also for “accountants, lawyers and fine arts graduates among others.” “Our goal is to make sure Goans do not have to leave the state for a job. At the same time we do not support influx of migrants in Goa,” the campaign states.
