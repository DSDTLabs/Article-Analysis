 During the year 2016-17, NFC achieved a record production of 1,512 metric tonnes of PHWR fuel bundles. NFC has also achieved the highest production of 1,154 MT of Zirconium oxide power and 759 MT of Zirconium Sponge from its production units at Hyderabad and Zirconium Complex (ZC), Pazhayakayal in  , to meet the Zircaloy requirements of the PHWRs and Boiler Water Reactors (BWRs).
 
 A function was organised to celebrate the occasion at NFC on Thursday. G Kalyanakrishnan, chairman & chief executive, NFC, congratulated all the employees for the achievement.
