KOLKATA: By Bengal coach Ranjan Chowdhury’s own admission, his team played their “worst match” of the tournament on Sunday, but it was enough to edge Chandigarh 1-0 and seal a berth in the Santosh Trophy semifinals.

 
 A lucky first-half goal by Bidyashagar Singh at the Mohun Bagan ground gave the 32-time champions their third win on the trot. Chandigarh, already out of contention, were denied by the woodwork once and missed several chances as they ended their campaign with a solitary point from four matches.
 
 Bengal will face Kerala - who also booked their last-four slot on Sunday - on Tuesday to decide the Group A toppers. Both teams have nine points, with Kerala enjoying a better goal difference (+13 against Bengal’s +8).
 
 Chowdhury said Bengal’s target is to win every match and become champions. But he must have been concerned with the way his team struggled in getting past a side which had nothing but pride to play for.
 
 Chandigarh gave the Bengal backline a series of scares, especially in the second half. They could have snatched a draw, if not a win, in the dying minutes of the match. Nikhil Prasher’s header off a corner ricocheted off the crossbar before Bengal defender   effected a goalline clearance only for Chandigarh striker Pratik Joshi to send the rebound well over the bar.
 
 “I’m not at all happy with the team’s performance. We probably played the worst match of the tournament today,” Chowdhury maintained. Bengal started promisingly when Tirthankar Sarkar’s free-kick forced a smothering save from Chandigarh goalkeeper Nitish Mehra in the seventh minute.
 
 
 
 Kerala stormed into the semifinals of the 72nd Santosh Trophy beating Maharashtra 3-0 in a Group A encounter at the Howrah stadium here on Sunday.
 
 With three wins from as many matches, Kerala and Bengal are tied on nine points each but the former are on top of the group table on goal difference.
