PUNE: New Year’s Eve turned out to be a boon for city   as they made   in the countdown to 2017. 

 Data shared by two operators —   — reveals that thousands of rides were hailed from party hot spots in and around the city, such as Koregaon Park, Vimannagar and Baner. 
 
 Demand for taxis peaked between 7 and 8 pm on December 31, when most partygoers stepped out for the evening, and again surged between midnight and 2am when the revellers headed home.
 
 According to Ola, as many as 2,726 bookings were done on its platform between 7 and 8pm — the busiest time slot for the aggregator, while 393 Uber riders completed their journey just nine minutes before midnight — the drive time closest to the   on the service provider’s platform, booking records show.
 
 Interestingly, among the findings is the total number of rides that citizens and drivers did on December 31, with four Ola drivers completing as many as 24 bookings each. On the other hand, a single citizen hailed Uber taxi service five times on New Year’s Eve — the highest on the company’s platform in the city for a single night, the records show.
 
 Expectedly, taxi drivers were only too happy to have raked in the moolah. Said Siddheshwar Navande, an Uber driver partner, “December 31 was busy, but very productive and fulfilling day at work for us. We were expecting high demand during the evening and were prepared to use features like ‘Heat Maps’ on our app that guided us to the areas where riders were looking for cabs. Even though I could not spend the New Year’s Eve with my family, I didn't mind one bit as I earned more than double the amount I usually make on a weekend.”
