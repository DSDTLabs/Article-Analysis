HYDERABAD: To check littering, members of an Hyderabad-based group,   (PES), have rolled out a ' ' campaign. As part of this drive, volunteers are seen training garbage cleaners/pickers about the right way to segregate waste and educating people, particularly shopkeepers in places such as   near Alwal, R K Puram etc, about the need to refrain from dumping garbage arbitrarily. 

 
 "It is not only important that garbage be disposed in the right place but it is also necessary that we cut down on the garbage being created," said Medha N, an environmentalist who has collaborated with the city NGO to start the 'Pheko Mat' campaign. 
 
 Spearheaded by a group of eight volunteers, the campaign has used different mediums to spread awareness about waste management. Apart from creating a short film to train safai karamcharis (daily cleaners), volunteers have also started door-to-door visits to train residents on turning waste into compost. "The campaign has been 70% successful until now. Even if one in 10 people objects to littering, we can garner more support," said Medha.
