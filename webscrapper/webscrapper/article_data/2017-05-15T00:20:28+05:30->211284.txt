 
  Sfter wowing audiences on celluloid, Sandalwood’s popular   twins Advithi and Ashvithi have now made inroads into full-fledged serials. The sisters, who gained popularity with their act in Mr & Mrs Ramachari, have recently gone on air with their first daily soap,  .
  The serial is a string of various theme-based episodes and the ones the sisters feature in is also about twins. “It’s a story about how the parents of these twins cheat a groom and con him into marrying the wrong twin and not the one he is in love with. Since they look alike, he doesn’t realise this interchange for a long time. And when he does, he’s obviously livid and takes an extreme step. This forms the crux of the story,” explains Adhvithi.
  “Frankly, the two of us didn’t find any difference between acting on celluloid and the small screen. Both mediums offer their own challenges and it’s gratifying when you overcome them with elan. As long as we get to act, we don’t mind taking up any role, be it in films or daily soaps,” avers Ashvithi. The twins, who have earlier been part of many reality shows on   and Telugu  , share that many teleserial offers are now coming their way and that they’re in talks for an interesting concept to be shot shortly.
  “Doing Shaantam Paapam was a good beginning and the response has proved that we were right in trying our hand at the daily soap scene,” sum up the sisters.
