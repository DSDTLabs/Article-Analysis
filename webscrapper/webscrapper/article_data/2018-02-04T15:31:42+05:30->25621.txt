If you have romanced almost everyone, then there will come a time when you’ll be single. I am not sure if that is the case with Tollywood’s loverboy  , but I recently saw him partying alone in presence of three of his exes —   Sarkar,   Chakraborty and  . In fact, Mimi and Subhashree’s bonhomie at the rooftop barbecue party hosted by Neil Roy, Shyam Sundar Dey and Anish last Saturday became the talking point of the film industry after the girls — who looked spitting images of each other — pouted and posed for Insta photos. Not so long back, the rivalry between both over Raj had set tongues wagging and it was suggested, at one point, that the director was secretly meeting one and openly dating another.

 
  
 
 
 At the party, both girls were a riot as they came together and like it or not, also prepared to enjoy the evening to the hilt. Mimi and Subhashree walked in together, stayed together and even left together, while Paayel kept to herself and didn’t care to exchange pleasantries with the women. The other actress to party hard that night was Srabanti, who even uploaded a pic and said how happy she was for the two of them. So, what did Raj do at this chance meeting with his once-upon-a-time girls? He had all of them at hello, but refrained from having a sit-down adda with any. Those close to the trio tell me Raj is single, at least this month, and the women have vouched not to cry over spilt milk again.
 What with Raj exiting both their lives, Mimi and Subhashree too are working on clearing the air of awkwardness between them. Looks like they are at the finishing line.
