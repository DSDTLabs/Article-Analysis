  It will portray how journalist   engaged in what Kornbluh described as "intimate diplomacy" with Castro, Cuba's revolutionary leader. "I'm so excited to bring this story to life with great creative partners in Gal, Jaron, Peter and  ," Kroll said Wednesday in a statement, according to a report.
 
  "This is a remarkable true story, anchored by an incredible woman, and lends itself to a dramatic and thrilling cinematic experience." Gadot, on the other hand, said, "When I first read Peter's article, I was entranced by his thrilling account of a complicated, fascinating woman in the midst of a high-stakes, real-life drama. I knew immediately that I had to be involved creatively with telling Lisa Howard's story, and am thrilled to be producing this film with Sue."
