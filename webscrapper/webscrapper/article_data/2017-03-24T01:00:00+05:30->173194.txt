 The album starts with Nilavedhu Karaiyedhu, a slow song that begins with a soft hum. This one is a tragic number and the composer has gone with slow, standard beats. The interludes have violin and kanjira bits that are quite nice. Sundar Narayana Rao does justice to the song and emotes well. Vaikom Vijayalakshmi sings the female portions and adds to the melancholy. Next is Kadugalavu that is philosophical. It is sung by Haricharan, whose vocals are pleasing. The orchestration is impressive and leaves you refreshed. 
 
 There are two theme songs...   Theme 1 starts with a mouth organ and has a laid-back feel to it. The music gets a little sad and is accompanied with a hum that gives you the chills. Anoop Seelin, the composer, has chosen his instruments well. The track picks up pace and begins to resemble music for a chase sequence in the latter portions. Action, romance, thriller, tragedy â€” the track covers all the emotions in a mere 4.41 seconds. On the other hand, Kadugu Theme 2 is slow and has an amusing tune. It features a mouth organ that keeps stopping abruptly, followed by a likable guitar bit. The track, however, is cheerful, and the composer introduces drum beats accompanied by a flute. It is as though the composer has fused two tunes into one.
