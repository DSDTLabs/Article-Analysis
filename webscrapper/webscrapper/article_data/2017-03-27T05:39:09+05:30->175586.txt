We are happy as the local youths are going to get education as well as employment opportunities with the college coming to our village,” said Kailas Geete, sarpanch of Savtamali Nagar.
 
 He also appealed to the state government to include villagers into the Central Committee that will be established for finalising the construction of the building to cost Rs 25 crore.
 
 Member of parliament  , who was following this issue since his election in 2014, said the college will become a reality before the other two colleges proposed in the budget.
 
 “The Government Agriculture College in Nashik is way ahead with all necessary documents from villagers ready to offering 100 acre of land for the proposed college. The agriculture ministry has given in-principle approval to this college and we have also taken in-principle approval from the Mahatma Phule Agriculture University to which the college will be affiliated,” said Godse.

It is in the centre of four agriculturally-important tehsils of Nashik district like Sinnar, Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar and Nashik. Moreover, it is located on Mumbai-Agra Highway, and near   and proposed Samruddhi Highway,” Godse said.
