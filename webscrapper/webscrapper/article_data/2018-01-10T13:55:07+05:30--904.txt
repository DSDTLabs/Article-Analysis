PATNA: Preparations are on in full swing for   which will be celebrated on January 22. Artisans are offering a wide range of choices and are busy giving final touches to   idols.

 Despite the sudden dip in temperature, the artisans are working 24X7 to complete the idols on time. The misty weather and high levels of humidity have, undoubtedly, hampered the flow of their work as the idols take longer to dry.
 
 “Keeping in mind the possibility of foggy conditions in January, we had started working on the idols in the second week of December. In normal weather conditions, it usually requires four days to complete an idol, depending on its size and intricacy of the craftsmanship. However, due to dense fog and high humidity levels, we are taking almost six days,” idol maker Mahesh Kumar said while hiding his “masterpieces” under a sunshade to protect them from dew drops.
 
 Colourful idols of the Goddess of knowledge cost anywhere between Rs 50 and Rs 3,000. Mahesh, who has made at least 40 idols so far, told this reporter, “Pichle saal notebandi ke kaaran dhanda manda tha... Almost all the idols have been booked and I expect to earn a profit of Rs 25,000 this year.”
 
 A number of artisans have put their idols on sale opposite the   on  . “Apart from the traditional mud idols, ones made of plaster of Paris are also in demand. They take lesser time to dry, are light in weight and can be coloured using a spray painting machine,”  , another artisan said, expecting better business this year.
 
 According to him, idol making is a seasonal business which depends on the market conditions. He said, “Students and coaching centres are our main customers. With Saraswati Puja around the corner, we hope to make good money this time.”
