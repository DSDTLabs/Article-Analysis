PUNE: Sightseeing is passé. Experiential holidays are in vogue. Wanderlust junkies are increasingly   of the mundane and throwing in a bit of adventure in their itinerary.

 Travel firms say those heading out of the city during the monsoon are interested in more than just sightseeing. They are opting for combo packages that give them an opportunity to experience a taste of the local and do off-beat things. 
 
 After all, it’s all about looking at a destination with fresh eyes. “Everyone makes a beeline for Nashik for its vineyards, but now there are options to explore its rugged side. Kamshet is known for paragliding but travellers enjoy staying in farms,” says a person who organises such experiential stays.
 
 Elaborating on the trend,  , co-founder and chief marketing officer of Wandertrails, says, “Some outdoor activities can depend on the weather, especially during the monsoon, but rains are hardly a bother when it comes to travelling. In fact, monsoon travel is considered romantic by couples planning a trip.”
 
 Adds  , who runs   in Nashik, “A large segment of our visitors is from Pune. Considering the proximity, we see more demand over the weekends. A lot of young couples and families come and enjoy farming with us and we treat them to   food.”
 
 Sharing the details of his recent outing,  , a PhD scholar, says, “Knowing my interest in wines, my friend had planned a weekend getaway to a winery. Being in a vineyard and seeing the whole wine making process and tasting the varieties of wines was an experience like never before.”
 
 Another traveller,  , says, “Instead of going to usual places, we prefer off-beat destinations. Last month we went camping in Mulshi. It was a great trip near the lake, with a couple of heritage walks and treks thrown in. It’s all about soaking in the experience.”
