LUCKNOW: Investigators probing into the extortion threats to 19   and three others have found that the wires of the case are connected to several countries.

 Investigations have so far revealed that the extortion messages sent to the MLAs through WhatsApp originated from a number registered as a landline in Texas (US). A   Internet Protocol (IP) address and gateway was also used to send the messages in which the MLAs have been asked to pay Rs 10 lakh each or else face dire consequences.
 
 Investigators were also trying to establish if the extortion threats, which carry the name of a one-time   aide  , were actually being sent by him or his name was being used by someone else.
 
 Taking a serious note of the revelations, the UP police have sought help from Central intelligence agencies to unveil the faces behind the crime.
