Indore: With just six weeks to go for the Joint Entrance Exam ( ) advanced, students are setting their body clocks to their exam schedule and prepared themselves for the two three-hour papers which they will appear for on May 21.

 Students are changing their diets, increasing hours of study and decreasing hours of sleep to the minimum requirement with just one aim, to clear the JEE advanced.
 
 “For JEE mains I studied nine to ten hours a day. But now I devote around 14 to 15 hours every day to my studies. I sleep for around six and half hours every night. I also plan to restrict my diet only to healthy food from Tuesday,” said Ananya Sharma, the state topper in JEE mains and a student from the city.
 
 Such drastic changes in schedules of students have compelled parents to alter their lifestyles accordingly. Parents have started to wake up at the same tme as their kids to keep their meals ready at a fixed time.
 
 “I make sure my daughter has her food and sleeps at the right times. Though she is punctual, I stick by her side with her daily routine to help her follow her schedule,” city student Devaishi Tiwari’s mother said.
 
 Some students in the city have made turned coaching classes into their second homes to retain the focus, which easily gets lost at home.
 
 “I study in a separate room at my coaching centre. A three hour practice test session from 9 am to 12 noon is followed with a two hour break for lunch and some self-study after which I attempt another practice test from 2pm to 5pm,” Devaishi Tiwari said.
