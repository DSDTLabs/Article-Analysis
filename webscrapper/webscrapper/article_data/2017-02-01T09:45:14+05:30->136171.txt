 Rao visits Paderu in Visakhapatnam agency every month to collect the raw material Pala Komma. “A broken mirror glass, soft iron wire, polish paper and plywood are required to make the handicraft, which is a completely eco-friendly. No artificial colours and paints are used on it,” Venkata Rao said, adding that he sells the handicraft at public places in the city frequented by tourists.

 When contacted, IV Lakshminath, general manager for Lepakshi, the handicraft emporia of AP Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited in Visakhapatnam said, “We always encourage new wood work handicraft. We will surely recognise such artists and help them by placing their art in the exhibitions in Visakha Utsav and other shows at Tirupati.”
 
 Similarly, Kancharapalem resident S Farooq ekes out a living by refabricating sarees. “I bring back the original look of worn sarees. People like to keep their wedding sarees or ones used in other occasions like first-birthday after wedding. But these sarees lose their original look with time. I learnt this art from Guntur and am surviving on it,” Farooq said.
