Pawan Kalyan’s   has already claimed the attention of Tollywood fans and now so has its first song. 

  Power Star’s fans are over the moon with the new single released on March 3,  . So much so that the song hit a million views in just 4 hours since its release. 
 
  The song composed by Anup Rubens and written by Ram Jo is a powerful number with lyrics to match up. And that is probably what worked with the audience. 
 
  Directed by Kishore Kumar Pardasani the film also stars   as the female lead and is produced by Northstar Entertainment.
