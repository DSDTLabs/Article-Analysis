CHENNAI:Mettur MLA and   leader   said nearly   from the rival group were ready to support OPS and they included some ministers too.

 “There are at least 35 MLAs from EPS group who are ready to join our leader. This includes several ministers. If this happens, the government will fall. This government does not have public support,“ Semmalai told cadres in Salem. While this remains a claim as of now, in the event of a confidence vote, the `defection' of a minimum of even six MLAs could bring down the Edappadi K Palaniswami government.
 
 Even as the stalemate in talks between the two factions in AIADMK continued, former chief minister Panneerselvam is continuing his statewide tour with the next stop being Salem on May 12. He will be meeting cadres in Salem district and will also address them as he did at Kottivakkam in east Kancheepuram district last week when he launched his programmes.
 
 The OPS faction is still not ready for merger talks with the EPS faction and wants their demands to be fulfilled. Meanwhile, Panneerselvam along with his group leaders will meet party cadres at Bose Ground in Salem. “Our leader will continue his tour and in Salem he will address the cadres and also get their views on local body elections and on uniting with the other faction,“ a senior leader told TOI.
 
 Panneerselvam will tour other districts as well with meetings scheduled at Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts where former minister K P Munusamy has good support.
