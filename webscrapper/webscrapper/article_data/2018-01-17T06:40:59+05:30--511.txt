CHENNAI: Chennai City Traffic Police have come up with new markings on roads to denote accident-prone spots across the city. They have also started putting up pictorial warnings at places where fatal accidents have taken place, so that motorists can be cautious on these stretches.

 These accident spots will have a circle with an illustration and the number 304 (A) (section of IPC that deals with death due to negligence) in yellow colour. The markings will be visible at night too, even if the area is poorly lit.
 
 Accidents may have occurred for a variety of reasons, such as a structural deficiencies of the road or poor lighting or lack of visibility of road signs. By notifying such spots, police have found the number of accidents has come down.
 
 In a study, police found that many road users involved in accidents had failed to notice warning boards kept on the roadsides, as rarely they turned their heads while driving. The study also looked at reasons for accidents, like an abrupt median or lack of a median, and overtaking.
 
 R Sudhakarm joint commissioner, traffic (south), said motorists were also consulted as part of the study. “Many said the markings on the road made them alert and cautious. We also found that speeding drivers slowed down when they reached these spots,” he said.
 
 Mohan Ram, a gym trainer at RK Salai said the move helps spread awareness. “The marking on   made me think of reasons behind accidents. This has made me slow down and not try to overtake other vehicles,” he said.
 
 So far, police have identified 23 accident spots for marking. Among them are   in Kilpauk, Santhome and Periyar Statue on Anna Salai. Teams are now marking spots on   (ECR) and Old   (OMR)— two stretches where overspeeding is common.
