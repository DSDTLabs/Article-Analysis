“Why did you pick me?” asked  . “To probe the life of a celebrated dancer, to see up close the woman behind the mysterious persona,” replied her biographer, Sujata Prasad.

 Thus was the traditional interview cheekily inverted, in the flowing ‘The Dancer and the Dance’ session on Sunday at  . “I don’t think I’ve done anything great, though much has been made of it!” joked the feted Bharatanatyam and   dancer, as candid as she’s always been.
