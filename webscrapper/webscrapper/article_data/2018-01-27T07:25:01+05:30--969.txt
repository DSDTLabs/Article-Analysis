VISAKHAPATNAM: Come February, over 2.5 lakh beneficiaries of three government-funded housing schemes across   will participate in a mass house-warming ceremony.

 The housing department is looking for an auspicious date to hold the programme in all 13 districts including Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Vizag, where nearly 20,000 beneficiaries will take part.
 
 The state government held a similar programme for one lakh beneficiaries in October last year with chief minister   formally launching the programme in   on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
 
 Now, the government wants to cover 2.5 lakh more houses in the next phase.
 
    project director for   said, “The ceremony will be held in the first week of February. The date is yet to be fixed. Nearly 7,000 houses in Vizag would be covered in the ceremony.”
 
 Prasad said the houses were being built from the 2016-17 fiscal to the present fiscal. The housing project is being implemented under three housing schemes — NTR Housing Scheme (rural),   (rural) and Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana (urban). An amount of Rs 1.5 lakh would be given to the beneficiaries of NTR Housing Scheme as subsidy, while Rs 2.2 lakh would be given under PMAY (rural) and Rs 2.5 lakh for PMAY (urban).
 
 “The government would give 100% subsidy to beneficiaries under these schemes. The beneficiary will have to build the house on his or her own and the government would compensate the construction cost as subsidy,” Prasad said.
 
 Prasad said nearly 61,000 beneficiaries were identified in the district and the construction of more than 40,000 houses is yet to be completed in the district. The remaining houses would be covered in the next house-warming ceremony, he added.
 
 Sources said the state government has set a target to build at least 17.40 lakh houses for underprivileged sections, including 12 lakh in rural areas, at a total cost of Rs 50,000 crore by the end of its term in 2019.
