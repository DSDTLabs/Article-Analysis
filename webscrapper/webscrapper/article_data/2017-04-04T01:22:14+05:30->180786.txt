 During protest, the workers also alleged that the company terminated the employees without notice and that they were also underpaid. “We also told police that we were asked to work for 10-12 hours. We had asked the company to make it eight hours per day,” said a worker requesting anonymity.
 
 Ajay Kumar, circle officer II, Noida said that the company reopened and workers resumed their work peacefully.
 
  “The company management has agreed to look into the issues raised by workers. We are investigating the case and examining more CCTV cameras. We will also consult forensic experts in this case,” he said.
