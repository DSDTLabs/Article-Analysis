It was an afternoon with a perfect amalgamation of art and nature when recently, the painting and Bonsai exhibition titled Bhumija, which means ‘Born from Earth’, was organized by   and  . The event, organised at Shashwat’s residence, witnessed a thumbs-up from Lucknowites and was attended by the who’s who of the city. 
The theme of the exhibition was rainbow where the decorations and arrangements were done up accordingly with the venue decorated with rainbow colour kites, bangles and streamers. 
 A total of 100 different and rare species of Bonsais were showcased at the exhibition by Shashwat. 
 Not just the plants, even the 15 impressionistic paintings byPankaj earned several compliments from the guests. "All the paintings showcased here are very special and unique because none of them have been made using a paint brush. They have been made using fingers, painting knifes, where one can see the natural beauty of Earth," shared Pankaj.
 A life-size cut-out of the Mona Lisa painting acted as a perfect backdrop for everyone to click selfies.   too was spotted getting herself clicked with the cut-out. "Setting up a bonsai and an art exhibition together is such a unique and creative idea. I seriously can’t get over of these plants and paintings," said Kum Kum. 
 To make the morning more memorable, a live music performance by Tabissh Husain was also organised.
