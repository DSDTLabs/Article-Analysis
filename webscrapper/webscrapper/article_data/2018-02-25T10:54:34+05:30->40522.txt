PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji ( ) on Saturday cautioned the public against open burning of waste in violation of an order by the   (NGT), as it would attract fines. Commissioner  , in a notice, stated that burning of any waste is prohibited under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

 The NGT, in an order dated December 22, 2016, had directed authorities to ensure prohibition of open burning of waste. “Any person responsible for such burning is liable to pay environmental compensation ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000,” the CCP notice states.
 
 The CCP has further asked the public to provide segregated waste to the door-to-door garbage collectors, or to deliver it at the material recovery facility set up in various zones by the corporation.
 
 Ironically, the CCP itself is facing a fine slapped on it by the Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) after it was revealed that its employees were burning waste at the Campal parade ground behind the garbage sorting site.
 
 After complaints by citizens, the GSPCB had cracked down on panchayats and municipalities resorting to this crude method. Last year, complaints by St Cruz resident Arturo D’Souza and Panaji resident Raj Vaidya against the Mapusa municipal council resulted in the civic bodies being fined for flouting the law.
