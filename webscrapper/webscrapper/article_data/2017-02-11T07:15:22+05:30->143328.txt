LUCKNOW: As the cat and mouse chase ensues between police and criminals again, the   keep their fingers crossed. It has been 40 months since  , then 26, was alllegedly gunned down by  . But somehow, odds have remained stacked against the Sahu family.

 Caught in the legal tangle before the district and session court, city police failed to establish before the court that the murder weapon recovered from Aqeel was indeed used to kill Ayush. TOI accessed the ballistic report prepared by forensic science laboratory in the Ayush murder case. Though Ayush’s murder took place on October 16, 2013, the laboratory took three years to prepare the report. Aqeel’s lawyer   said, “City police is framing Aqeel in the latest murder case without establishing his involvement in Ayush’s murder. We highlighted the discrepancies in police theory during the investigations. The high court granted him bail last.” The ballistic report, which was prepared on September 1, 2015, clearly states that striations found on bullet recovered from Ayush’s body could not be matched with the ones found on the recovered murder weapon. The report, however, confirmed that the cartridges and shells that were found from the crime scene were fired from the same weapon.
