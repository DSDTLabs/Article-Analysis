AHMEDABAD: The suspension on issuing and renewing   will end soon, but tougher guidelines will come into force.   officials said the new guidelines will be out by the first week of April. Officials also said that prices of alchol at permit shops will likely increase by Rs 500 to Rs 700 per bottle, due to a threefold increase in excise and transport duties. 

 Those seeking health permits will also have to pass more stringent scrutiny before getting one.
 
 According to sources in the home department, a panel of doctors will be formed to scrutinize health liquor permits. The panel will verify the medical reasons cited with the health department before assent is given.
 
 Prohibition department officials said a panel of seven medical experts will also scrutinize "suspicious" applications.
 
 "Till now, medical certificates for seeking health permits were given by doctors holding an MD degree. This was sent to the concerned district civil hospital where a panel of three experts including a full-time physician, a civil surgeon or civil superintendent and a professor of medicine would examine the application and the doctor's certificate before approving it," added a prohibition official.
 
 Now, a panel of seven medical experts and state health department officials will examine health permit applications before sending them to the prohibition department for final approval.
 
 Health permit holders will now have to shell out between Rs 500 and Rs 700 more for a bottle of liquor "As excise duty and transport duty per litre of liquor has been raised threefold from a total of Rs 145, a bottle of liquor will cost approximately Rs 500 to Rs 700 more," a senior prohibition department official said.
