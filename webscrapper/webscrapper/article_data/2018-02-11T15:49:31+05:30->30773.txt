 has been one show that brings prominent actors and yesteryear stars onto the same platform, and gives a space for interaction with the audience as well. The latest guest to pay a visit to the hosts   and   recently was yesteryear actor Vincent. 

 The promo of the video shows the actor having fun at the show by singing and dancing. Actor Vincent is seen crooning the old song En Swaram from the film Anupallavi, while the audience and the hosts are seen rejoicing. 
 
 Then follows a lot of banter and funny stints, that leave the audience in splits and which is the USP of the show. 
 
 Below is the video:-
