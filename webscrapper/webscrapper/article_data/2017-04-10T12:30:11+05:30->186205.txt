 “We have been organizing the blind car rally for last few years and every time the number of participants goes up. It was an exciting moment for both the drivers and the blind navigators equipped with the route map in Braille language. A total of 105 cars were a part of this year’s rally,” said  , one of the organizers.
 
  It had to be a precise co-ordination as the cars had to reach at nine different points right on the time. The cars that reached too early or too late lost points. 
 
 The cars covered a distance of 45 km in 2.5 hours as the drivers were not supposed to drive beyond a certain speed limit. The organizers said that this rally was to showcase the talent of blind persons and sensitizing people about the extraordinary abilities of blind people. “While one of the participants committed to give job to a blind man, one of the winners announced additional donation,” Sharma said.
