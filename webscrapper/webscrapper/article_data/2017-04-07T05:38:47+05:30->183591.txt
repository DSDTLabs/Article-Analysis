BENGALURU: The alternative road to   (KIA) via   is likely to be launched only by August this year, beyond the original   of  .

 The toll-free road -South Western Road (SWR) -which seeks to provide a swift and smooth link to KIA, especially to people from east and southeast Bengaluru, is expected lessen the traffic burden on Hebbal flyover-Trumpet intersection by 35%. On Tuesday, a highlevel meeting was held to discuss various issues regarding the pro gress of the road.
 
 M Lakshminarayana, principal secretary, PWD, said the project requires at least four more months for completion due to technical challenges.“There are underground electric cables that supply electricity to the KIA on the 400-metre stretch between Begur and the airport wall.We have discussed the matter with KPTC and Bescom to make sure the cables are handled carefully. We have asked their technical support team to protect these cables by providing a casing kind of duct.This exercise will take two months,“ he added. When the airport was established, underground cables for various utilities were placed a little away from the 20-foot-wide road in Begur.“But now that the road width is 100 feet, the utility cables will fall under the middle of the widened road,“ he said.
 
 Apart from safeguarding the cables, civic works like setting up of street lights are also pending, PWD officers said.
 
 The road, though incomplete, was opened temporarily for vehicular movement during the aero show in February.
