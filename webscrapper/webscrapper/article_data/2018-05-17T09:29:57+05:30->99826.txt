VISAKHAPATNAM: The boat that capsized in Godavari river in   district on Tuesday night did not have a valid licence. But in an even more startling revelation, it turns out that of the over 800 boats that ply in the waters of Andhra Pradesh, only 83 have a valid licence.

 “The boat that capsized near   village of   did not have a valid licence issued by AP Ports, the licensing authority,” K  , port officer, AP Ports, told TOI over phone.
 
  
  
 According to him, almost 90 per cent of the private boat operators ply without a valid licence. “Till recently, it was the irrigation department which would issue the licence. We took over in November 2017 and have so far issued licences to 83 boats including 23 vessels from the north coastal districts of East Godavari, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and  ,” Sastha said.
 
 “Once a boat operator comes to us with valid documents and proper fitness certificate, we will be able to issue the licence within two days. More than 700 boats are yet to get themselves registered with our department. And this despite we holding awareness camps among the boat operators on a regular basis,” Sastha said.
 
 Sources said the boat operators who are shying away from procuring the licences are doing so due to various reasons like unfit conditions of the boat, improper documents. This being the situation, another boat tragedy like what happened in East Godavari on Tuesday is waiting to happen in any corner of the state anyday.
