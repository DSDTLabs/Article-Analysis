LUCKNOW: While targeting   during his speech in   on Tuesday, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav provided some lighter moments when he kept telling deputy chief minister   how he was different from CM   and the other deputy CM  . 

 However, MLAs of the ruling BJP were up in arms against him when he said that Sharma should be careful about who he allows to sit on either side of him in Assembly. "We (SP and BSP) are one. How will you break us? And if you can't, then you won't be able to return to Vidhan Sabha. That is why I am telling you, you should only have good people sitting on your right and left," Yadav said, addressing Sharma, adding that he would like nothing better than to see Sharma drop the "deputy" from in front of his designation.
 
 "Both the CM and the other deputy have been taking back cases against themselves. But from what I know, you don't even have a case against you. You have also inspected the Dial 100 police service started by us, which till now you only criticised. But at least you inspected it, the other two still haven't had the time," he said. Speaking on BJP's loss in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls, Yadav said that BJP's excuse that people did not come out to vote would not stand as there was massive disappointment with the government. "Had people actually come out to vote, you would not lost by thousands but by lakhs of votes," he said.
 
 Questioning the government's claims that the crime graph had fallen in UP, Yadav listed out names of BJP members who have been murdered in the state, saying that fake encounters were doing nothing to stop rising crime. "In five years, we received 16 notices from  . Your government got 37 in one year for fake encounters, riots etc. You have also started appreciating Dial 100 police service," he said.
