LUCKNOW; A Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court on Monday asked UP advocate general   why its orders were not conveyed properly to enable chief secretary   to file his affidavit in a contempt matter. Reacting to the AG’s argument that he thought that   had no concern with the matter, therefore, he was not required to file affidavit, the court said, “It is surprising to note that once there is specific order of this court for an officer to file his counteraffidavit, how can his lawyer give such a contrary opinion.”

 
 Later, irked over AG’s request for adjustment of date, Justice   again expressed displeasure on the way   wanted the date of his choice and hence declined his request and granted two days only to the chief secretary to file his response in the matter, fixing May 9 as the next date of hearing.
 
 The awkward situation had arisen in the court on Monday in course of hearing of a contempt petition.
