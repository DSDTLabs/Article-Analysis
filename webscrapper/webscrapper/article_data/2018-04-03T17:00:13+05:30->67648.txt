NEW DELHI: A   footage of a pit bull going on the   in a west Delhi colony has gone viral on the social media. The footage shows the dog dragging a child from the stairs outside a house and mauling him. 

 The dog went berserk, particularly after locals began attacking it. The drama, which continued for over 10 minutes, left three people severely injured. Cops have initiated a probe into the incident and are on the lookout for the dog and its owner.
 
  According to locals, the incident took place on March 28 at a JJ colony in west Delhi's Uttam Nagar. The dog, belonging to a grocery shop owner, managed to loosen its leash and started chasing teenagers playing on the road. While other boys managed to enter a house and save themselves, one of them was left behind. The footage showed the dog pulling the boy by his pants and then pouncing on him. 
 
 Seeing this, a woman standing nearby tried to shoo the dog with a stick but got attacked by him. Later, a group of passersby stopped and tried to pull the child away from the dog.
 
  The woman, in the meantime, picked up a chair and tried to hit the Pit bull. Hearing the chair crash, the dog's attention got diverted and he started chasing other passersby, who had stopped to witness the action. The dog then ran back towards the direction it had come from. 
 
 The child, meanwhile, was taken to a hospital by the woman. Doctors said that he had suffered bite injuries on his arms and chest. Two other teenagers, who were injured while running away from the dog, were also treated at the hospital.
 
 Cops said that they had approached the locals after the video had gone viral on the social media and a probe was initiated to search for its owner. A case will be registered against them, said a police officer.
 
 Experts say that the Pit bull is a hound that requires careful handling due to its violent nature.
