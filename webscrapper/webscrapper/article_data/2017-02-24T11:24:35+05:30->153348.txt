PUNE: Australian opener  , 20, had a tough initiation on Indian wickets as he had to counter spin with the new ball on a turning track on his first day of the Test. The Aussie weathered the storm with an elegant knock of 68, except that it was t marred by a toilet break.

 Twenty-seven overs into the Australian innings, Renshaw felt he couldn't hold it anymore and `retired ill' to rush to the bathroom. Not only was it very un-Australian -remember Dean Jones retching and vomiting in the Chennai heat and still standing up to hit a double ton in the historic tied Test in 1986 -but the timing was awfully wrong as well.
 
 Renshaw and David Warner had negated the Indian ploy of opening the attack with spin until the latter fell with 82 runs on the board. And to add to the confusion, and astonishment of the in-coming batsman Steven Smith, Renshaw was keen to go back to the pavilion as well.
 
 “It came pretty suddenly, probably about five or ten minutes before Davey (David Warner) got out,“ Renshaw explained his urge to answer nature's call. “I asked Richard (Kettleborough, on-field umpire) how long there was till lunch, and he told me `half an hour.' I was struggling a bit then. It wasn't an ideal situation to be in.
 
 “He (captain Smith) didn't really understand what was going on, I sort of just ran past him. I told him I needed the toilet. Obviously , we'd just lost a wicket so there would be two new batsmen out there but it's a hard scenario to be in.“
 
 Allan Border, Jones' captain three decades ago, wasn't pleased at all. “I hope he's lying on the table in there half dead. Otherwise, as captain, I would not be happy,“ Border was quoted as saying in the Australian media.
 
 Maybe it has something to do with his Yorkshire origin. But Renshaw did win back his skipper and teammates' hearts with his skill and temperament.
