CHENNAI: If you jump a   signal or are caught driving under the influence of alcohol or riding without a helmet, you may have to spend three hours watching videos played aboard a 'booze  ' parked at important traffic junctions besides paying hefty fines. And it won't stop there. You may also have to answer questions after watching the videos to create awareness about traffic rules.

 Of late, traffic police have been taking violators to police buses that house a projector and screen. "We show videos that run for at least an hour and the violators have to sit patiently and watch them," said additional commissioner of police of the traffic police K Periaiah.
 
 In  , a senior police officer said, 'booze buses' were parked at specified points and the police there took traffic violators for a trip across the city to enlighten them about the ill effects of the traffic violation. Emulating these 'booze buses', Chennai police have also made such arrangements to give their traffic enforcement in the city a spin.
 
 The traffic police have created several awareness campaigns. As part of these initiatives, interviews of people who have lost their kin in road accidents have been compiled in DVDs which are shown to violators.
 
 On the ground, the city police have identified road stretches where police will carry out heightened surveillance.
 
 "Each assistant commissioner of traffic enforcement police in the city has been asked to identify stretches in their jurisdiction and deploy police personnel to ensure all motorists adhere to safety norms," said a police officer.
