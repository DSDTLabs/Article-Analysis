ALWAR: A   of   leader distributing money to a woman in the presence of party MLA   and municipal council chairman   went viral on Tuesday. A BJP worker   is seen handing over money to the woman in the video.

 The party leaders later clarified that during the party campaign at the sabzi mandi a woman approached the leaders complaining that she was not given pension. Since the model code of conduct is in force, the womanâ€™s complaint could not be redressed. 
 
 BJP MLA Bhanwarilal Singhal, who was seen in the video, accepted that a woman had indeed come with complaint related to pension. But her grievance could not be addressed due to model code of conduct. He, however, claimed that he was not aware of giving her any money.
 
  said it will approach the election commission (EC) with complaint of BJP trying to influence the voters by distributing money.
