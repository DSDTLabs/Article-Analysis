KOLKATA: The panchayat contest may be over for the opposition even before it has begun. Data released by the state election commission on Monday reveal that the opposition hasn’t been able to file nominations in an overwhelming majority of seats, while the ruling   has not managed to put up more candidates than there are seats.

 BJP hasn’t been able to file nominations in 52.6 % seats,   in 69.6 % seats and   in 87.2 % seats, according to the commission’s data. Trinamool, on the other hand, has not only filed nominations for each of the 58,692 gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zilla parishad seats that go to the polls on May 1, 3 and 5, it has even filed names of 14,192 candidates over and above this.
 
 
  
 Scrutiny is set to take place on Wednesday, and the last date to withdraw nominations is April 16.
 
 The results will be obvious. Trinamool, having retained the Birbhum zilla parishad, winning 41of the 42 seats uncontested, is likely to repeat the feat in Bankura zilla parishad too, where it has won 26 of the 42 seats uncontested. In   zilla parishad, it has won 22 of the 70 seats uncontested and in Burdwan (East), it has won 13 of the 58 seats uncontested. This could be a worrying trend, for the opposition has been able to pitch most of its candidates for the zilla parishads. BJP is contesting 766 of the 825 zilla parishad seats, CPM 563 and Congress 377. For example, for gram panchayats, BJP doesn’t have a candidate in 20,861seats, CPM in 31,347 and Congress in 41, 411seats.
 
 Poll expert   said felt the number of uncontested seats would most likely increase significantly after the April 16 deadline for nomination withdrawal. “In 2003 we had witnessed 11% seats go uncontested, and 10.66% in 2011. Given the indications this year, this percentage will increase substantially.” The biggest win for the ruling party is likely to be Murshidabad, the turf of Congress MP and the party’s state president Adhir Chowdhury. The leader, who has been pleading in Calcutta High Court to allow candidates to file nominations, has been unable to put up candidates in 15% seats in his district. “Trinamool is trying to snatch away democratic rights,” he said.
 
 In North 24-Parganas, where BJP is making inroads, Trinamool has already won 6 panchayat samitis: Barasat II, Haroa, Hasnabad, Minakha and Sandeshkhali I and II. Commission sources said over a million and a half candidates have filed, with Trinamool leading with 72,884 candidates. BJP’s list of those who have filed is less than half of Trinamool’s, with the party failing to contest 24,185 civic bodies state-wide. Still, BJP’s 34,507 candidates outnumber CPM’s
 
 (14.01% of candidates) and Congress’s (5.87%). “This is unprecedented,” said CPM’s legislative party leader  . “The commission... is acting like a puppet in the hands of the Bengal government and ruling party. We condemn this.”
