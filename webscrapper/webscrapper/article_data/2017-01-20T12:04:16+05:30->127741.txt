AURANGABAD: The Bahujan Kranti   (BKM) — an outfit claims to be representing 165 different organisations from across the state — is all set to organise a   in Aurangabad on Friday to press for various demands including establishment of separate courts for atrocity-related cases and reservation to the OBCs, SBCs and tribal according to their current population.

 Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Siddharth Shingare along with other BKM office-bearers claimed this rally would be unique in nature as representatives from different castes, creeds and religions and social background would participate in it.
 
 “The rally will begin from   and would reach the Aam Khas maidan where it would culminate into a public meeting,” informed Shingare.
 
 He claimed the participants in the rally will demand reservations for Maratha, Dhangar, Lingayat and Muslims according to their population. We will also press for the demand to conduct a census of OBCs, SBCs, and de-notified tribes and reservations for them according to their population proportion.
 
 The BKM’s other demands include implementation of reservation in private sector, increase in scholarship of backward class students. Shingare said about 1,000 activists have been trained to ensure order in the march. “The Bahujan leaders would explain the reason behind the rally and justify the need for various demands they have been raising,” said Shingare.
