MUMBAI: While overall turnout for the   election was nearly 10 percentage points up from the last time, in 52 of the total 227 electoral wards, more than 60% of voters exercised their franchise. That's nearly two of every three registered voters.

 The highest was in the strongholds of   and  , alliance partners in the outgoing civic house who decided to contest separately.
 
 Surge in voting occurred in two suburban clusters, the stretch comprising Bhandup, Mulund, Vikhroli and   in the eastern suburbs, and the areas comprising Jogeshwari, Dindoshi, Malad, Kandivli, Borivli, Gorai and   in the west.
 
 Overall, though turnout was high in pure percentage terms, the absolute number of voters rose by less than 5 lakh.This is because the electoral list shrunk due to roll revisions after deletion of names for various reasons.
