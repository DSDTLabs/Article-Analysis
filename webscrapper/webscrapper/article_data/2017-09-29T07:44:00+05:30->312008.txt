Amritsar: It was 103 years ago on May 23, 1914 that Komagata Maru, a Japanese steamship, arrived in Vancouver’s Coal Harbour carrying 376 passengers from Punjab seeking asylum.

 It spent two months at anchor when the Canadian government refused to allow its passengers to leave the ship. On September 29, British gunboats stopped the Komagata Maru and forcibly diverted it to Budge Budge in Kolkata and opened fire upon its passengers, who protested to board a train to Punjab. As many as 20 of the passengers died in an ensuing riot. 
 
 Almost a century later, descendants of one of the passengers have sought a monument be built to commemorate the occasion.
 
 The granddaughter of Sarhali (Tarn Taran)-born Gurdit Singh, who had chartered the steam liner in 1914, wants a statue be erected in the memory of her grandfather in Amritsar so that the coming generations know how Gurdit tried to rescue Punjabis from Hong Kong and from the tyranny of the British rule.
 
 “Though Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau had formally apologized for the Kamagata Maru incident in the House of Commons in May 2016, the Indian government is yet to build a memorial of the man who had led the rescue operation of standard Indians from Hong Kong,” Harbhajan Kaur, granddaughter of Gurdit Singh, said while talking to TOI on Thursday.
 
 Stating that the incident was a black chapter in the history of Canada, Harbhajan Kaur’s husband Tarlochan Singh Virk said all that the family needed from the government was to build a statue in Amritsar where Gurdit Singh had died in 1955.
 
 He said his father-in-law Balwant Singh, who was 10-years-old at that time, too had accompanied his father Gurdit Singh on the ship and when they reached Budge Budge in 1914, Balwant Singh managed to reach Sarhali village whereas Gurdit Singh remained underground for 7 years to escape arrest by the British.
