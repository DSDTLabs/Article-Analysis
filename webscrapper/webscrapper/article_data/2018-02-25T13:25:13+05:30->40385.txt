Madurai: A total of 200 women have been shortlisted from 13,800 applicants to receive scooters in the first phase of the   two-wheeler scheme in Madurai. However, they have to wait for some more days before laying their hands on the keys.

 Amma two-wheeler scheme has received good response from the public ever since it was announced. Most applicants said that even took driving lessons after submitting their applications.
 
 Rani, a resident of   said that she was one of the earliest to apply under the scheme. However,   said that she hasn’t received any intimation so far.
 
 Jayanthi, a widow from Madurai, said that she had applied for the benefit with great hope of obtaining a scooter. “Owning a vehicle is a convenience especially when I have to drop off my children in their school before I go to office,” she said.
 
 Many have approached their former councillors with a hope that they could help them get shortlisted for the scheme. “I told them that they would get a vehicle it if they are eligible. I asked them to approach the office and submit the application,” said a former councillor.
 
 Some of the applicants said that they have minimal chance of being selected for want of enough political influence, but are keeping their fingers crossed.
