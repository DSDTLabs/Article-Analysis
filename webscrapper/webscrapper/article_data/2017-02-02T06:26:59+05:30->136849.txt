NEW DELHI: PWD secretary   carried out an inspection of south Delhi roads on Wednesday, travelling from ITO to   via   and Munirka. PWD, which is in the middle of a massive road strengthening and recarpeting exercise, has come under massive criticism for the state of roads in the city.

 “I travelled from   to   place, going via Bhairon Marg, Mathura Road, Moolchand, Ring Road, IIT and Munirka. It is clear that roads need repair urgently . The flyovers, both at IIT and Munirka, are in need of attention with large patches of the road surface missing,“ he said.
 
 “Some of these stretches, like the flyovers, are not part of the sanctioned road works and will be taken up additionally . Some of these roads are linked to road redesigning but we will have to take them up on priority .All work needs to be completed by March,“ he added.
 
 Accompanied by senior PWD officials, the secretary also inspected footpaths and central verges and said that there was not a single stretch that he found to be in perfect condition.
