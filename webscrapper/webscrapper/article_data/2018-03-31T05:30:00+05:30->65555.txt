Mysuru: Anguished by three-time JD(S) corporator Sandesh Swamy’s decision to join the BJP, the president of JD(S)’   wing Paramesh said that the departure would seriously dent the party. “More than a 100 SC/ST workers will quit the party in the wake of Sandesh’s departure,” said Paramesh.

 None too pleased with JD(S) state president HD Kumaraswamy’s remarks about Sandesh not having made any significant contributions to the party, Paramesh said, “Sandesh’s contribution to the growth of the party is immense. Kumaraswamy’s remarks are not true.”
 
 Paramesh also expressed displeasure over Kumaraswamy’s attitude about leaders leaving the party fold. “He says, whoever wants to stay can do so, and those who want to leave can leave. This is disheartening. We have all worked for the party, and invested our hard-earned money to help the party grow,” he added.
 
 Expressing dismay over the choice of candidates for the assembly  , he added, “Those who have done nothing for the party, those who have not even erected a single party flag are being given tickets to contest the polls. How many votes will such candidates poll? Kumaraswamy will know once the results are out. He should know about people who are trying to destroy the party.”
