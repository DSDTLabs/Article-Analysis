GURUGRAM: A director of a private firm approached police against an unidentified person for allegedly circulating a   email from an ID bearing her name. An FIR was registered against the unidentified man on March 13.

 The complainant, a resident of Delhi, who works at a company located on One Horizon, Golf Course Road, Gurugram, alleged that the email had been sent to a large number of people in her professional field since March 5, damaging her reputation.
 
 “A very derogatory, defamatory and abusive email about me and my family was sent to people in my organisation from a fake email ID on March 5. I was in Michigan, US, at the time. One of my colleagues informed me about the same and I immediately forwarded the e-mail to all concerned senior officials in India and abroad for necessary action. Investigations are on in the company. I returned on March 11,” she said in her complaint.
 
 She added that it seemed the perpetrator of this email could be someone from her company too. Some of the contents of the email, according to her, clearly pointed to a handful of people who were privy to some of the things pertaining to an official event, which was held in May last year, she alleged.
 
 An FIR has been registered against an unidentified accused under sections 66-C of the IT Act and Section 509 (act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the   at Cyber Crime police station.
