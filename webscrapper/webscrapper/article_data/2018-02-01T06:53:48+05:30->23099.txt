CHENNAI: Imagine a loaf of bread soaked in milk, grains of rice bouncing off an umbrella or a hot boiling cup of coffee being poured over your mobile phone. Instead of remembering these objects mentioned individually in the form a list, placing them in a visual and spatial context makes it automatically easier for your brain to remember them, according to international memory athlete   who interacted with students at   on Wednesday. 

 Kilov, who has won several memory championships, spoke during the international techno-management fest of Anna University, Kurukshetra, on the campus. 
 
  "The language of memory is association. There are two ways to remember - one is through memory for things and other being memory for words. Don't treat your memory as a filing cabinet but as a laboratory where alchemy takes place," said Kilov.  He stated that practising recalling and testing ourselves over and over again was a better technique for embedding long-term memory rather than even writing. He also encouraged using mnemonic techniques like the 'method of loci' which is based on linking something to a place you are familiar with to embed it in your memory.
 
 The fest was inaugurated by governor   who said the fest will help bring about more industry-academia exchanges. Higher education minister  , who was also present, said the university was taking up all preparations to conduct the   online for the first time this academic year. 
 
 This 12th edition of the fest which will continue till February 3 will feature more than 35 competitive event.
