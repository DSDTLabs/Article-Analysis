NEW DELHI: From demonetisation and corruption to rising rape cases, a myriad of issues found mention at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday as   launched a scathing attack on the Modi government over its alleged governance failure. The high temperatures notwithstanding, the new protest centre of the capital — having replaced Jantar Mantar on NGT orders — saw heavy turnout for the “aakrosh rally”: the Congress even pitched the numbers at 10,000. 

 The   was organised to express “disappointment” with the Centre’s policies and there was a buzz in the air when Congress president Rahul Gandhi urged people to question Prime Narendra Narendra Modi’s governance. Sudip, a Congress   from outer Delhi’s Burari, shared his “anger” with this correspondent: “When demonetisation took place, people stood by Modi in the hope that the government will bring back black money. Where are the “acche din” that the PM keeps talking about? Where is the black money now? All we hear is about rich people running away with people’s money.” 
 
 Rahul Singh, a local vendor, asked what the government had done for people like them. “Ever since Modiji came to power, our problems have multiplied, either through new rules or sealings. So many businesses have been ruined, but the government has remained a mute spectator,” Singh claimed. 
 
 A section of the crowd urged the government to act against the rising rape cases in the capital. Workers of Mahila Congress Committee pledged to put up a “united fight” against the government and revive Congress under Gandhi’s leadership. “Nirav Modi took your money and ran away. This government made you stand in queues to access your own money. Did the “desh ka chaukidar” say a single word about Nirav Modi?,” Gandhi alleged. 
 
 Former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit was also present at the rally.
