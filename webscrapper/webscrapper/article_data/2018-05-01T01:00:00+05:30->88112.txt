Stand-up comedian   lodged a police complaint against unknown person(s) at the Bangur Nagar police station earlier this week, after a cheque went missing from his house. 

 Balraj was given five cheques to be handed over to his teammates, who play for a television  . However, soon after, the owner of the team informed him that he shouldn’t deposit them, as they bore wrong signature, and that a fresh set will be issued shortly.
 
 A month later, when Balraj was scheduled to return the cheques, he found one missing. He immediately contacted the owner and told him that he is going to file a police complaint on the matter.
 
 Balraj recollects, “Being the captain of the cricket team, I was given five cheques to be distributed among players. However, the owners later called to inform me that a fresh set of cheques will be issued, as the signature on the old ones was incorrect. While returning the cheques, I realised that one of them worth Rs 1,22,000 was missing. When I couldn’t find it in my house, I decided to file a police complaint. The cops found out that the cheque was deposited on two occasions within a span of 15 days, and an invisible marker was used to change the name and amount. The first time, the amount was altered to Rs 6 lakh; when that cheque bounced, the person tried to deposit it a second time with the original amount.”
 
 He adds, “The matter is being investigated, and I have no clue about who could have done this. I am assuming it would have happened when I was away for shoots.”
