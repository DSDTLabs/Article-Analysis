CHENNAI: More than 1,000 residents of   in   are left swatting all day due to the mosquito menace, as a canal that runs through the locality, meant to drain out flood water, is choked with garbage and sewage. The Nandanam canal drains into Mambalam flood water channel, which empties into   river. 

 While attempts were made a few times to clean the canal and the river that pass close to the neighbourhood, the narrow channel continues to have slushy stagnated water which has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Garbage, dry tree branches and leaves and plastic bags float on its surface, often restricting the flow of the water. 
 
 Ravindrakumar Paul, a resident of Nandanam, said that very few attempts were made to clean the canal in the last three years. “In 2015, the floodwater had cleaned the canal to a major extent. The prevailing stagnant water encourages the breeding of mosquitoes. We request periodic cleaning of the channel throughout the year.” 
 
 “Unclean, dark coloured water in the canal indicate the absence of proper drainage in some houses of the locality,” said a resident.
 
 In response to several mosquito menace complaints received during February and March, Thenmozhi, an entomologist working for the city corporation, said that they had requested the residents to dispose off the garbage appropriately as a permanent solution to reducing mosquito breeding. 
 
 A few recent unsuccessful attempts to clean up the narrow channel pose a risk to the residents. While the wall on one side of a bridge over the canal was broken six months back for cleaning, the other side was also brought down last week for electrical work. The absence of parapet is a safety hazard to residents. 
 
 Kothandaraman, assistant engineer of zone 9, said that they were working to find a solution to keep the narrow channel clean. When asked about the damaged walls of the bridge, he said, “We will resolve it soon.”
