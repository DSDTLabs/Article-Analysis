Palanpur: Squally weather accompanied by unseasonal rains prevailed in Sami and Harij talukas of Patan district on Tuesday, leaving farmers growing psyllium husk (isabgol), castor, fenugreek (methi) and other crops jittery about potential damage.

 In Harij, rains damaged the grains and other agricultural products lying in the open in premises of APMC yard, sources said. The entire stretch of both talukas was lashed by stormy winds and showers while some villagers also reported hail storms.
 
 However, people got some respite from scorching heat sweeping the region for the past many days. tnn
