JAIPUR: Members of two communities got into an   over a   in Bagru on Monday. However, the senior officials quickly resolved the matter before it could escalate.

 “The dispute started on Saturday night when members of a community were carrying out a religious procession,” ACP, Vaishali, Ram Avtar Soni told TOI.
 
 “The religious procession included loudspeakers. Member of another community objected to the loud volume. Thus, the two groups got into an argument. Following this, police rushed to the spot and controlled the situation,” Soni said.
 
 On Monday morning, when the same procession was returning from Bargu, the two communities again entered into an argument. Bagru police rushed to the spot and spoke to the members of both communities.
 
 “There was a small issue but we prevented the situation from snowballing into a greater controversy,” additional DCP Ratan Singh told TOI.
 
 Sources said that the devotees had gathered at a place where they danced on religious songs. The loud volume irked members of another community and they asked to lower the volume. There was a heated discussion and one community went to the police station to give a complaint. Later, another community also went to the police station and demanded that no complaint be filed against them.
 
 Eventually, both the parties reached an amicable solution.
 
 “The Galta temple in Bagru is beaming with Kanwariyas in the month of Shravan,” the police official said.
 
 According to police, further investigations in the case is on.
