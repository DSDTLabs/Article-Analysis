CHENNAI: M  , husband of AIADMK general secretary VK  , on Sunday alleged that leader of the opposition and   working president   and his party were behind the violence in Chennai on Monday last. 

 He demanded that Stalin "take responsibility and apologise" for the violence.
 
 On January 23, after police started evicting pro-jallikattu protesters from Marina Beach, a group of protesters set Ice House police station on fire and protesters clashed with police in many parts of the city.
 
 On Monday morning, Governor C Vidyasagar Rao addressed the state assembly. That evening, a bill to amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 to make   a permanent sport in the state was passed by the assembly unanimously in a special session, replacing an ordinance promulgated on January 21.
 
 On Sunday, speaking to reporters in Pudukottai, Natarajan alleged that the DMK had hatched a plan to prevent the Governor from reaching the Secretariat on January 23 morning and to show black flags on his route to the Secretariat. 
 
 Natarajan said police, who found out about the plan, tried to prevent it by asking the protesters to disperse. He alleged that that was when "they started pelting the cops with stones" and "set the police station on fire."
 
 "Will the cops set fire to a police station," he asked.
 
 He added that the protests had been peaceful for six days with no untoward events till "they" (DMK) "sent in certain people." 
 
 He said the students had protested in a disciplined and united manner but the violence was the "mistake of Stalin, who wanted to bring politics into it", he alleged. 
 
 He said Stalin and the DMK had "instigated the students, causing a situation which gave a bad name to students" and also sent miscreants into the crowd.
 
 Natarajan claimed that he had proof for his allegations and urged the state government to take action against DMK and other groups responsible for the violence.
