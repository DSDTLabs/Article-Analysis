AHMEDABAD: Wearing short clothes may not be an appropriate choice if you plan to visit MJ Library. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-run   recently put up a notice at the library’s entrance stating, ‘All the readers entering MJ Library may please take note that those wearing short clothes will not be allowed to enter the premises’. The authorities have issued a blanket ban on wearing short clothes, according to the notice. The civic body-run library is regularly visited by many including students preparing for exams and those who borrow books.

 The controversial notice is pasted just below another notice that reads ‘No reader should stand near the watchman’s counter without purpose’. Both these notices are right at the entrance of the library. Peculiarly, the notice mentions it has been issued by the librarian, however, it neither carries the official’s name, nor seal. Moreover, the two notices have been simply printed on an A4 sheet and pasted on the wall.
 
 MJ library librarian Bipin Modi could not be reached for comments. Interestingly, senior authorities of the AMC were caught completely unawares. “AMC has not issued any such notice. It has not been brought to our notice at all. We will look into the matter,” said  , chairman – School Board, AMC.
 
 When questioned about this, municipal commissioner, Mukesh Kumar, also said, “I don’t think such a notice has been issued by AMC. We will investigate the matter and take appropriate action,” said Mukesh Kumar.
