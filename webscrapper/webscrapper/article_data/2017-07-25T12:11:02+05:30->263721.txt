Primary schools located within the old AUDA limits — in areas such as Bopal, Thaltej, Sanand, Ghuma  , and   — and falling under the jurisdiction of the district primary officer (DPO), have been asked to announce a holiday on Tuesday following the release of 50,000 cusecs of water from the Dharoi dam. Nearly 1,200 government primary and 650 private schools in Ahmedabad district fall in the DPO’s remit. “Earlier we had announced that 69 government schools located in the vicinity of the Sabarmati’s downstream of the Dharoi dam would close,” DPO Mahesh Mehta said. “But looking at the situation, we have asked all district schools to remain shut on Tuesday.”

 Ahmedabad city   said, “City schools have been given the discretion to declare a holiday depending on waterlogging and other rain-related problems on Tuesday. Officially, we have not announced any holiday.”
