MUMBAI: City based model, anchor and former  ,  , rescued a turtle from a trash site where it was cruelly packed inside a  . The turtle was found dumped at a roadside trash near Central Institute of Fisheries Education at Versova, on Sunday.

 While she was on her way back to home after shoot, Garg noticed some movement inside the bag, as if something was trying to come out. She immediately stopped her car and went to inspect.
 
 "I suspected that it might be a kitten or a puppy, abandoned by someone. I was shocked to see a big turtle in the plastic bag. I immediately called Plant & Animals Welfare Society - Mumbai (PAWS-Mumbai) Helpline. As guided by the volunteer, I took the turtle home and kept it in water. Since it was terribly hot outside, it's shell was highly dried. The turtle was handed over to the   Rescue team," said Garg.
 
  
  
 Nisha Subramanian Kunju, the honorary Animal Welfare Officer associated with PAWS-Mumbai, said the turtle which we rescued from Versova is Indian Black Turtle (Melanochels trijuga). "We have informed the forest department about the incident and will be releasing in its natural habitat after medical checkup and necessary treatment," she said.
 
 Animal activists have pointed that there are several pet shops in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai, from where protected species and also exotic birds and animals are available over the counter. ``Such sale of turtles and other foreign and exotic species is illegal. Often, people take a fancy for them and buy these pets; but once they develop any health complications, they are cruelly dumped. This is not the right thing to do,'' said an animal activist.
