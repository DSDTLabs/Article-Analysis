CHANDIGARH: The president of   Teachers’ Association ( ),  , in his letter to the Panjab University vice-chancellor,  , wrote that pick and choose policy must be shunned and principle of seniority be followed in case of officiating charge at the highest offices of the varsity.

 “There have been instances in which the seniority of faculty was completely bypassed and person/s were made to officiate (verbally or in writing) on the basis of pick and choose, for reasons best known to the authorities,” the letter stated.
 
 “In the past, when dean research was appointed on the basis of seniority, he/she was made to officiate in the absence of DUI/VC, in view of his/her seniority. But since the post of director research is no longer based on seniority, but on selection, and the incumbent is appointed irrespective of his/her position in seniority list, there is no justification for asking him/her or any other teacher bypassing the seniority, especially when there are a lot of professors in between on the seniority list,” the letter alleged.
 
 “Such acts of pick and choose and willful violation of principle of seniority by the authorities themselves are bound to cause heart burning and frictions within the teaching fraternity, detrimental to the academic and administrative health of the University,” it added.
