Panaji: The Chemists and Druggists Association of Goa will join its apex organization, the All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), in observing a one day bandh on May 30. Retail and wholesale pharmacies will remain shut from midnight on May 29 till midnight on May 30 to protest against the government’s e-portal proposal which requires stockists and vendors to upload details of each sale on the e-portal of the government within a stipulated period.  “All pharmacies attached to government hospitals and private pharmacies attached to private hospitals will remain open during the bandh. Patients are requested to procure the medicines they need before the day of the bandh,” said president of the association. The association stated that the proposed regulation pertaining to the entering of data of day-to-day purchase and sale and online uploading by drug traders across the country will be painful and cumbersome for all traders. It doesn’t agree that the e-portal system will reduce anti-microbial resistance and believes that it will create a shortage of medicines in the county instead.
