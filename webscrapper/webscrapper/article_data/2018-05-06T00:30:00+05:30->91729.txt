Bengaluru: Though Karnataka is making efforts to eradicate malaria and no deaths due to the infection have been reported in the past four years, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi continue to be the problem areas. Heavy rain and humid weather conditions make the coastal districts a breeding ground for the malaria-causing mosquito, say health department authorities. The state saw 941 cases of malaria in the first three months of 2018, of which a large chunk — 688 — was reported from Dakshina Kannada. The district witnessed 566 cases in 2017. Udupi reported 74 cases in 2017 and 21 between January and March 2018. Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a plasmodium parasite, which affects red blood cells. It can be life threatening if untreated. While the state government is aiming to make Karnataka malaria-free by 2025, the cases in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada, and the sudden outbreak in Tumakuru, have raised concerns. “The outbreak has hindered the elimination efforts. Also, there are concerns over cases which are yet to be controlled in the coastal region,” said a source. Only one case was reported from Bengaluru Urban district (included BBMP areas) last year. “Bengaluru is safe because it is located 1000 metres above sea level and isn’t favourable for the plasmodium parasite. However, preventive measures are being taken to curb mosquito breeding. The problem lies with Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, where construction activity is high. Stagnant water and cement tanks, and consistent showers are the main reasons for mosquito breeding,” said Dr BG Prakash, nodal officer, National Vector Borne Born Disease Control Programme. So far, no cases of malaria have been are reported in Bengaluru Urban, Chitradurga and Mandya districts in 2018. Mysuru is the only district where no case has been seen since 2017.
