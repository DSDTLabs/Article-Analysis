TRICHY: A private school in   district has launched a post card campaign urging the Union government to constitute   (CMB). Post cards were sent to Prime Minister   with a common text demanding to constitute an independent body for enabling   to receive its due share in river Cauvery. 
 
 As many as 1,800 students participated in the campaign organised by a private school in Cauvery delta. Speaking about the campaign, principal of Neelan Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Needamangalam, G Bhuvaneshwari said that about 90 per cent of their students are from families depending on agriculture and allied activities. “We wanted to convey our need to the national capital so we preferred writing our demand in post cards addressed to the Prime Minister,” the school principal told TOI.
 
  For the past two days, as many as 1,800 school students from class I to class XII have been writing the post cards sponsored by school management with a single demand pitching for the constitution of Cauvery Management Board.
 
 Post cards addressed to Prime Minister of India, South Block, New Delhi had unique text conveying “kindly constitute Cauvery Management Board and please save our delta farmers.”
