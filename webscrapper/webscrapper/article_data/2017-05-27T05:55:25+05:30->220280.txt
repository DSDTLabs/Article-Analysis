NEW DELHI: President  , Vice President   and finance minister Arun   raised a toast to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s communication skills at the launch of two books on Friday to mark the third anniversary of the BJP government at the Centre. 

 The President received the first copies of the two books at a function at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Describing Modi as “one of the most effective communicators of the times”, Mukherjee compared him to   and Indira Gandhi for his ability to inspire people. The President cited Indira’s speech at the UN Assembly to mobilise public opinion in favour of the liberation of Bangladesh. He said various initiatives taken by Modi had resulted in the Indian economy moving forward in a steadfast manner. 
 
 Jaitley said bold decisions have defined this government over these years. “In order to govern effectively, governance must have a high value of credibility. And therefore you really have to divest yourself of power. Eliminate all discretions, which even with the best of intentions in the past, have brought discredit to governments and let objective criteria decide various decisions,” the finance minister said. He said one of the first important decisions of the PM was to divest politicians of discretionary powers in matters where commercial benefits were involved. “I think that pays dividend,” he said. Referring to Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme, Jaitley said it helped the PM reach out to millions. “We saw the decline of radio. It was almost becoming a defunct medium... the Prime Minister spotted the strength of the radio,” he said. It was highlighted by vice president Hamid Ansari who called ‘Man Ki Baat’ an ingenious and influential communication platform created by the PM. He said ‘Man Ki Baat’ takes a traditional medium like radio and marries it to the entire spectrum of communication technologies—from television to the internet, social media to mobile telephony.
