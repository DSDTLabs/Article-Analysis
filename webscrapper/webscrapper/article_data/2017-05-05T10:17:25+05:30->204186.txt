VARANASI: Prime Minister  's   made a dramatic turnaround in its cleanliness quotient on Thursday when it improved its rank from 418 in 2014 to 32 in the Swachh Survekshan 2017. It was the only city from UP to figure in India's top 100 in the survey which was conducted in 434 cities across the country this year. 

 In 2014, Varanasi's rank was 418 in a total of 476 cities surveyed. Its poor performance continued in 2016 when it ranked 65 in a survey of 73 cities with a population of more than one million. UP CM  , whose hometown   ranked 314, hailed the dramatic improvement by sharing a tweet from Swachh Bharat Urban handle which said, "Category : India's Fastest Moving City (North Zone >10 Lakh) Winner : Varanasi (U.P) Congratulations #Varanasi!" 
 
 Varanasi mayor Ram Gopal Mohaley credited the achievement to the “inspiration from the PM“ as well as “a proper system for disposal of municipal waste“ by the sanitation staff.“We set up 95 public toilets against a target of 135. Besides, 126 urinals, 8,547 private toilets and 3000 community dustbins were set up in the last one year,“ said Avinash Kumar, a municipal officer.
 
 “But for 200 more points, we could have been placed among top 10 cities,“ said Kumar, adding that 100 points were deducted for failing to achieve the target set for open defecation free (ODF) facilities. Out of 90 wards, only 35 could be provided ODF facilities. Another 100 points were lost because of poor score in people's feedback, he said.
 
 The Swachh Bharat campaign was launched in 2014 to make India cleaner by 2019 to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. In November 2014, PM led the campaign when he picked up a spade to clean silt at Assi Ghat here.
 
 In UP, 50 of the 62 cities surveyed in 2017 are ranked 305 and below. Out of these, 41 cities are in the bottom 100 list.
 
 Varanasi obtained 1,515 points out of 2,000. Out of 2,000 total points, 900 are for solid waste management which includes parameters such as garbage collection, disposal, treatment and open defecation. It also takes into account the number of sanitation workers. As per norms, there should be 28 sanitation workers per 10,000 people in a city. In Varanasi, there are 2,600 sanitation workers for a population of 12 lakh.
