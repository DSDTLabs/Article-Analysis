ALLAHABAD: The   on Thursday planned to attach the property of   Father Leslie Benedict Cutinha has evaded arreste since he was accused of hitting a class XII student and injuring his eye in the process.   ( Civil Lines) DP Tiwari said, "Police have applied for   (NBW) against the vice-principal and later would be attaching his property." He added, "The department is also planning to announce a cash reward on his head." 

  After an FIR against the errant vice-principal, police have been looking for him since May 12 but have failed this far. The college management had suspended the vice-principal after class XII student Shervyn sustained injuries in his right eye on May 9, allegedly after being roughed up by Cutinha. Police are relying on the absconding vice-principal's call details to trace his current location. 
 
 They have also been compiling inputs on those who helped him in his escape.
