NEW DELHI: Facing fire from   for asking   to postpone his constituency tour,   administration on Monday said it had no problem with the Congress vice-president visiting the district as planned.

 Talking to reporters amid brewing controversy, district magistrate of Amethi, Yogesh Kumar, said the authorities had never said no to Rahul Gandhi’s trip on October 4-6 but only asked for a 24-48 hour postponement in view of police’s preoccupation with security arrangements for Muharram and Dussehra festivals. “Rahul had proposed to visit Amethi from October 4-6. We never said no (to his visit),” he said, according to agency reports.
 
 With Congress reacting angrily to the DM’s letter by calling it politically motivated and refusing to reschedule Rahul’s visit, Kumar said the administration was ready for the local MP’s trip as planned. He said while his request was not considered, the authorities would ensure “all-round security” for the Congress leader.
 
 The district’s change of stance defused what appeared to have the potential for a political row. After the DM’s letter became public on Sunday, Congress spokespersons argued that administration could not stop an MP from visiting his constituency and cited the visits of Prime Minister   to Varanasi during Navratri festivals to back their claims.
 
 Congress claimed vindication after Amethi administration struck an accommodative stance. “Will chief minister Yogi or Prime Minister Modi decide if an MP can visit his constituency? An MP has a right to visit his family, that is his electorate. It (the DM’s letter) showed the malafide. In three years, BJP chief   has travelled to every nook and cranny of the country during festivals or otherwise.
 
 Has he ever been stopped? He was stopped just once and there was much hue and cry,” AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said.
 
 The AICC spokesman said the DM had withdrawn his letter only after the protest from Congress.
