VISAKHAPATNAM: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘perform, reform, transform’ will bolster India’s growth towards becoming one of the largest economies in the world, said vice president M   while delivering the inaugural address of the three day CII Partnership Summit-2018 on Saturday.

 
 Speaking to a packed hall comprising investors, diplomats and delegates from India and 39 other nations, Naidu hailed demonitisation as the “boldest economic reform” brought about by the PM. “Getting back the money to the banks is no ordinary fete,” he said, dismissing the political opposition to the move. “Demonitisation, along with GST, has increased tax compliance. The number of people who filed their tax returns increased from 6.47 crore in 2014-15 to 8.27 crore at the end of 2016-17. As a result, bank interests have dropped to 8.25%,” he added.
 
 He assured the gathering that the “long-term advantages of the tough reforms” would certainly outweigh the shortterm hiccups which “caused a bit of an economic slowdown”.
 
 Turning to Andhra Pradesh’s potential as a rapidlygrowing investment destination, the vice president urged investors to look towards the state that assured “stability and ability” under the N Chandrababu Naidu-run government.
 
 
 His optimistic outlook for the southern state was echoed by Union commerce and industry minister  , who said that the focus will not only be on ‘Make in Andhra Pradesh’ but also ‘Design in Andhra Pradesh’. Upholding sectors such as gems and jewellery manufacturing, agro-exports, leather and footwear manufacturing, medical equipment manufacturing, among others, Prabhu said that each of these had tremendous potential to create thousands of jobs.
 
 
 Among the high-points of the hour-long session was the exchange of an MoU document between   (ACMA), Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and   to develop the automotive industry in the state.
