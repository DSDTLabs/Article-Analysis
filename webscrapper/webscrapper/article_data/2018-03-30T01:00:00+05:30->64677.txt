 needs no introduction — the Padma Vibhushan awardee is one of the biggest living exponents of Hindustani music. At the age of 88, he can still move you with his flawless renditions, and his deep connect with the divine is evident when you hear him speak about music and spirituality.

 Panditji has rendered ' ' and ' ' in the film ' ', which is based on the life and works of Guru Nanak Devji, the revered founder of Sikhism. Talking about it, he says, “I bow to Him, singing for this film is a blessing. Unhone hi mujhse yeh gawaya hai. What can be bigger than this?” 
 
 The maestro, who is back with a film song after a decade, adds, “For me, 'Nanak Aaya' is not a   song. Main toh Guru Nanakji ki seva kar raha hoon. I have been singing Gurbani since many years.”
 
 When asked what inspires him to continue performing, he says, “When songs like these come up, I get energised. This is what fuels me. This movie will have a tremendous impact. I had seen it in America and noticed that everyone — Sikhs and non-Sikhs — were equally moved.” The film will hit theatres on April 13.
 
 The movie, being released by Viacom18 Motion Pictures and presented by Gurbani Media Pvt. Ltd, spreads the message of ‘Ik Onkar’ (One God). Panditji explains, “Pick up any holy text, and you will find that all religions lead to Him. The speed of the car may vary, but the destination remains the same.”
