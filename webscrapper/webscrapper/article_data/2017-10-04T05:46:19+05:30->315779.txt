MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday directed   run by the   to construct around 2,398   in   before June 1, 2021, according to the undertaking given by them. The developer will have to build around 887 flats of 861 square feet each and 1,511 flats of 430 square feet each.A specified number of flats would have to be sold to the Maharashtra government at a rate of Rs 135 per square feet. A division bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Nitin Jamdar said if the developer fails to meet the deadline, they would have to earmark an additional 10% of the flats for sale to the state government.

 The court was hearing an application by the developer over a 2012 order that restrained it from constructing buildings on its Powai land without permission.The court's orders had come on a PIL that alleged violation of lease conditions. Hiranandani had signed a lease for the 230 acres of land in 1986 in a tripartite agreement with the state and MMRDA. As per the agreement, the builder was to construct 50% of the flats admeasuring 430 square feet and the remaining of 861 square feet. Instead, according to the petitioner, flats were allowed to be merged to as large as 4,000-5,000 sq ft and sold at prices touching Rs 7 crore. One of the important conditions was that around 15% of the floor space index consumed would have to be sold to the state government at a rate of Rs 135 per square feet. These flats would be used by the state to house its staff. The PIL had claimed MMRDA initially imposed a fine of around Rs 2,000 crore on the builder, which was brought down to Rs 89 crore and finally the state further slashed it to Rs 3 crore. As per the 2012 HC order, the builder has to construct 2,200 flats admeasuring 431 square feet and another 2,200 flats admeasuring 861 square feet.
 
 Earlier this year, the HC appointed a committee to inspect and verify the affordable flats constructed and the remaining ones that need to be built. The flats will be in six residential towers.While some flats would be ready by December 2018, the rest have to be constructed before June 1, 2021. The court has allowed the developer one month to apply for permissions and around six months for the BMC to grant approvals. The builder will also have to open a joint account with the proto-notary of the HC, where the proceeds from around 207 flats would be deposited.
