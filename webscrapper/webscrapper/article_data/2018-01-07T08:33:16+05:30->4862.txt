PATNA: Loktantrik Jan Pahal (LJP) members on Saturday took out a protest march in Patna to condemn the violence and humiliation heaped on dalits at   in   by groups associated with the “Brahmanvadi-Hindutvavadi” ideology.

 The protest march, led by Kanchan Bala, Ashok Kumar and Ranvijay Kumar, originated from the JP roundabout near   and went up to the B R Ambedkar’s statue near the Patna high court.
 
 The three LJP functionaries regretted that the BJP-led Maharashtra government was yet to arrest   and Milind Ekbote who led the attack on dalits. “They are roaming free because they are associated with the ‘Brahmanvadi-Hindutvavadi’ groups that get protection from the BJP,” Kanchan said.
 
 They alleged the Maharashtra government was instead trying to implicate dalit icon and MLA Jignesh Mewani and young ‘pasmanda’ Muslim leader Khalid Umar in a false case. They said the BJP was trying to appropriate Ambedkar as a symbol for its use, but was heaping insults and violence on dalits.
