MUMBAI: The   have busted a three-member   that duped over half a dozen Mumbaikars of more than Rs15 lakh using  .

 Shivkumar Rathod (33), Sonukumar Prajapati (26) and Daludevi alias Shantidevi Prajapati (42) from   were arrested on Friday and 5.5 kgs of fake gold coins and chains seized from them.
 
 During questioning, the trio, who are cousins, purportedly told police they had cheated several people in Kanpur, Lucknow and Delhi, besides around half a dozen in Mumbai.
 
 Investigators said the trio would roam around in Kathiawari dress to give an impression that they were from Gujarat or Rajasthan and look for soft targets. “After choosing their target, they would approach the person asking for direction to the museum or traders who buy vintage jewellery. Once the person becomes curious, they would show him an original gold coin covered in dirt and say it was part of a treasure box,” a police officer said. 
 
 According to police, the gang would say they had found 4-5kgs of old gold coins in a treasure box in their farmland and that they wanted to sell it. “After negotiations, they would agree to sell all the coins for anywhere between Rs5 lakh and Rs 8 lakh. Once they get the money, they would hand over the fake coins and vanish,” said police inspector Mahesh Desai of crime branch unit 9. 
 
 The crime branch nabbed the trio by tracking down their location using their mobile phone number which they had given to the victims. The police were in search of the gang after receiving three complaints: an Oshiwara resident was cheated of Rs 4 lakh, an Andheri man Rs 5 lakh, and a Marine Drive resident of Rs 6 lakh. The crime branch have alerted the Delhi, Lucknow and Kanpur police about the arrest.
