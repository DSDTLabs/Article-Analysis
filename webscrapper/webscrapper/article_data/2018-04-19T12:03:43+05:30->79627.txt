KAPURTHALA: The National Highway Authority of India ( ) has been asked to stop collecting money at a toll tax plaza near Phillaur for not taking any road-safety measures there. 

  lok adalat issued the orders to NHAI on Tuesday, as the highway authority had not complied with the court’s March 15 orders. 
 
  toll tax plaza is located on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway. 
 
 In the month-old order, lok adalat chairperson Manju   directed the NHAI to close illegal accesses to the NHAI and ensure barricading. On Tuesday, the legal authority said not a single step had been taken for smooth and safe movement of traffic. “NHAI is stopped from charging toll tax at Ladhowal toll tax barrier near Phillaur, on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway, till the compliance of the order dated March 15, 2018, as toll tax is charged not as revenue for the government, but it is primarily charged for construction of the toll road and collecting charges as toll taxes later on. But the NHAI has failed to do its duty in a proper manner,” judge Rana noted in her order.
 
 The NHAI’s lawyer also placed on record notices which the NHAI project director issued to around 25 establishments for unauthorized access to the highway. The next hearing is on April 24.
