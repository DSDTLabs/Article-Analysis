NAGPUR: The 15-day   organized by Aalap Sangeet Vidyalaya concluded with a bang as the hundred participants sang and danced to tunes of Hindi and Marathi children’s songs. 

 The programme ‘Sangeet Parichay’ was organized by the music school on Monday at Gajan Vidyalay. Parents and mentors enthusiastically encouraged the young performers at the event.
 
 Children between the age of 5 and 12 were introduced to the basics of performing arts and yoga at the camp that started on April 15. The music school has been conducting summer camps for children since eight years.
 
 Director of the music school Anjali Nisal said, “The objective of the camp was to develop an interest about music among children through a short introductory training.”
 
 President of Shri Gajanan Multipupose Education Society Madhukarrao Dehankar, professor at   and corporator Rupali Thakur were the chief guests at the event.
 
 The young performers were accompanied by tabla players Shrihari Darodkar and Manoj Ghuse and harmonium player Nisal. The evening was a blend of solo and group performances. Children sang ‘Tata Tauji’ and ‘Dhum Dhum Dholak’ in groups. Some of the children danced to recent   numbers like ‘Bum Bum Bole’ and ‘Radha Teri Chunari’. 
 
 Children also performed a folk dance to the tune of Marathi folk song ‘Chhe Lallati Bhandara’. Finally all the 100 toddlers sang ‘I Salute My Flag’.
 
 Speaking to TOI before the event started, five-year-old Rugved Patorkar said, “I love singing very much. Today, I am going to perform solo and sing ‘Nanha Munna Rahi Hu’. I don’t like to dance, so I practised yoga in the camp.”
 
 Rupali Choudhary, a parent said, “I sent my child to the camp so that he improve his artistic skills and overcome his stage fright. It was also a good opportunity for him to get along with other kids and learn sharing.”
