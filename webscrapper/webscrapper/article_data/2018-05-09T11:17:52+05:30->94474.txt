Sandalwood actor  , who has campaigned for a few politician friends for this upcoming   elections, was also accused by many for the same. The actor has hence decided not to   any more for politicians during   and he said that through a letter that he wrote. The letter reads as follows:
Campaigning..
 Well I joined in campaigning for few friends of mine,, whom I have known for years and in some way have stood by me at times when needed,,how big or small doesnt really matter,,,what matters is that they did. And being there for them when probably they needed a little support from me is the least I could do....No regrets on that. 
 As per the requests of all my Friends & Fans ,,I'm not gonna be a part of any further campaigns. I do not consider myself so big that every one need me or that results wil change with my presence . I'm an actor and these friends and fans who have been with me in my journey, matter to me. 
 This is a tough decision I'm taking,,,,,Yet,, a decision I need to take for the sake of those fans n friends who have stood by me and I in no way wanna hurt them all with my actions. 
 Mch luv always. 
 Kichcha.
