Madurai: The claims of P S Sriraman, the superintending archaeologist of the Keezhadi site, that no continuation was found of the structures previously excavated, is a preplanned conspiracy to conceal the rich heritage of the great Tamil civilization, PMK leader S Ramadoss has said.

 According to a press release, he has said, the first two excavations conducted by former superintending archeologist Amarnath Ramakrishna found that Keezhadi was an ancient civilization which flourished in the Sangam era and that Tamil civilization was older that thought. But the third phase of excavations has completely contradictory to the findings of the first two. This is a conspiracy that Sriraman carried out with the help of the central government, he alleged. 
 
 Above all Rs 40 lakh was allocated for the third excavation, whereas the previous ones only received Rs25 lakhs and Rs30 lakhs respectively. Now they have announced that the excavation would come to an end by September 30.
 
 The archeology department has also sent the top layer of soil from third phase excavation for carbon testing. This is another conspiracy to further reduce the ancientness of Keezhadi, he claimed. TNN
