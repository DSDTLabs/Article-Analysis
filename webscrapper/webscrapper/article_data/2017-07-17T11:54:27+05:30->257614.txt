VADODARA: Investigations into the sim card cheating cases have revealed that the gang of fraudsters has duped several persons across the country. 

 The gang headed by mastermind   are on the prowl in Gujarat, Mumbai, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and   too. The cops are preparing to visit some of these states to track down not just Jamir but his accomplices too. 
 
 “This gang has committed such crimes in other states too. Jamir plans the crime and then asks his accomplices to get details of the victims so that they can be duped. Jamir used to get hold of photocopies of the identity documents of the victim. The gang members then used to get all details of the victim from the telecom stores,” said A D  , police sub-inspector, cybercrime cell, detection of crime branch ( ). 
 
 The crime branch has already arrested four persons in the case but they are yet to track down Jamir. “We learnt that he was in Mumbai but he has fled from there too. We are searching for him as he has all the information about the modus operandi and other members of the gang,” the police said. 
 
 This gang used to acquire sim cards in the victim’s name by producing his identity documents and then get the original one blocked by giving some or other reason in the telecom stores. They then used to use the SIM card to operate the victim’s bank account online and transfer money from his bank to different bank accounts. 
 
 Investigators said that Jamir or his men used to withdraw the money that was deposited in bank accounts in several states. 
 
 The four persons, who have been arrested, were paid a lump sum amount for their job. 
 
 The accused have been arrested in the past in Delhi for acquiring sim cards in names of other persons. That the gang used to easily acquire identity documents of the victims and changed the SIM cards has become a matter of concern for the cops.
