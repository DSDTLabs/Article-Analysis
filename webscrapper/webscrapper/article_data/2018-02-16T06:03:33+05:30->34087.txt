NEW DELHI: British premium appliances maker   will invest around Rs 1,350 crore (150 million pounds) to open company-owned stores in India under single-brand retail, and is also looking at launching its upcoming electric vehicles in the market here.

 Jake Dyson, member of the board of the 2.5-billion-pound company, said that India is a high-potential market and Dyson will gradually expand its presence here.
 
 The company — which retails products such as vacuum cleaners, hair dryers and air purifiers — plans to open 20 brand stores across 10 cities, which would include Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.
 
 “We have been working towards our India debut for some time now, and are confident that the country will emerge as one of the key markets for us globally,” Dyson told TOI. The company has hired former   mobile division head   to lead its operations here.
 
 Asked whether the company will look at local manufacturing, Dyson said that it may happen as part of a long-term strategy, though there are no immediate plans to this effect. “We are, at the moment, working on a project to source components and materials from India… As we grow and volumes increase, it’s likely that our management will consider to manufacture here.”
 
 The company’s product range will be targeted at the premium-end of the market, with hair-dryers costing around Rs 28,000, vacuum cleaners between Rs 32,000 and Rs 40,000, and air-purifiers between Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000.
 
 The British company is investing 2.5 billion pounds in the development of electric vehicles, and Dyson said that India will be one of the markets where it will pitch the cleaner cars. Asked about its launch in India, he said, “Of course. Absolutely.”
 
 The car will be revealed in 2020, and Dyson said that R&D teams of the company have been working on the project for the past few years. “We are a research-oriented organization and invest as much as seven million pounds on R&D every week.”
