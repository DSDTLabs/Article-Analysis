KOLKATA: West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences ( ) vice-chancellor   resigned on Wednesday evening in the face of a student body protest since Monday afternoon. The students demanded Bhat's resignation for allegedly hushing up a review committee report that apparently reached him in November. 

 An   query filed by students brought out the report, which is full of criticism for the university and its functioning.
 
 Bhat's resignation has been sent to CJI Deepak Mishra, where he has cited "health and family reasons" as reasons for stepping down. The letter says he wished to be relieved of his duties on April 7, after placing the review committee report before the executive council. 
 
 Since 2011, when Bhat took over as VC, he has been at loggerheads with students and faculty members over academic, research, infrastructure and administrative disputes. Most batches demanded the constitution of a review committee to take stock of the university's progress. The   Act states a committee has to be framed every five years, but the rule was flouted. The panel was finally set up in 2017, for the first time in 18 years. It sent its findings in a report to the VC on November 29, 2017, but Bhat reportedly denied having received it. 
 
 An RTI query revealed the report that said NUJS had not filled vacant faculty posts. It said the teacher: student ratio was undesirable for an institute of this stature. "Our teacher: student ratio is 1:22, the worst in the country. A plethora of plagiarism can be found in our research reports and there has hardly been any academic reform," said  , spokesperson for the students' body.
