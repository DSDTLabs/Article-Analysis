Mysuru: A man held 20 flaming   in his mouth for one minute, in a bid to find a place in the Guinness Book of World Records and   Book of Records. M L Shivakumar, a 55-year-old businessman, made a successful attempt on Friday.

 After a successful attempt, Shivakumar told reporters that he was inspired after he read about a man from Mumbai who created a record by placing 15 burning candles in his mouth for 30 seconds in 2015.
 
 “I have been practicing from the past six months to set a new record. I started with 12 candles and over a period of time tried with 15 and a week ago successfully tried with 20 candles and performed successfully today,” he said.
 
 “I will send the video clipping and other required details to Guinness and Limca authorities and will wait for their response,” he added.
 
 Shivakumar has another record in his name. He entered the Limca Book of records for holding more than 24 eggs in his right palm in 2008.
