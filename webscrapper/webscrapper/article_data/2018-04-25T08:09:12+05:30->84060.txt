 KOCHI: Tense situation prevailed outside   on Tuesday after a family alleged   by station house officer when they approached him with a person missing complaint. 

 Priyanka, a resident of Vennala, had filed a complaint that her 18-year-old sister Chelsea was missing on Sunday. However, police traced her and she was presented before a magistrate on the same night.
 
 Police said that the girl refused to go with her family and wished to go with another woman Lisy, an Irinjalakuda native, whom she knew.
 
 However, on Monday both parties came to the police station again. It has been alleged that the SI verbally harassed the family as they tried to talk to the woman. "I don't know what has gotten into her but she was behaving like she was under duress. The police should verify the credentials of Lisy," said Priyanka, adding the woman had earlier approached them with a marriage proposal for the woman when she was not of legal age.
 
 Palarivatton SHO KG Vipin Kumar said that it was the magistrate who sent her with the woman whom she wanted to go with. "On Sunday, the woman had gone to Kaloor Church from where she called up the woman Lisy and they both later came to the police station," said the SHO.
 
 Meanwhile, Youth Congress activists said that the SI was threatening the family.
 
 "When I asked him not to speak in a threatening tone, he grabbed me by the collar and yelled at me," said AR Padmadas, a Youth Congress activist.
 
  The activists along with family staged a protest before the police station. North CI K J Peter said that he held discussions with the aggrieved party. "They could approach the high court if they think that the woman is being illegally detained. We couldn't send the woman with her family because she didn't wish to. If they have any complaint against the SI, they could approach higher-ups and seek action," said the CI.
