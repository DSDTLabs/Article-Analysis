Pune: The city police officials are tabulating and studying the documents seized during the searches conducted at the residences of members of Kabir Kala Manch (KKM) and organisers of Elgar Parishad. The city police on Tuesday conducted searches in Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai and Delhi in connection with a case registered with the Vishrambaug police station against KKM members and others for making inflammatory statements during the Parishad on December 31, 2017.

 Joint police commissioner Ravindra Kadam said, “A large number of pamphlets, posters, documents, hard disks, pen drives, posters, data cards and literature have been seized by the police.” 
 
 “All the teams have returned to Pune and they are studying the documents, literature and the contents of the pen drives and hard disks,” he said. Police teams on Tuesday conducted searches at the residences of KKM members staying at Wakad, Yerawada and Pimple Gurav.
 
 Asked whether the police were investigating the case filed against Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mewani and students’ leader Umar Khalid, Kadam said the case was also being looked into. “Both the cases pertain to inflammatory and provocative statements and both are being investigated,” he said. A senior police officer said there were corroborative evidences in the case.
 
 The Vishrambaug police registered two offences against the persons who made the speeches during the Parishad and who organized the Parishad on January 4 and 8. Police claimed that the suspects made provocative statements in the Parishad which led to riots in Koregaon Bhima and adjoining villages on January 1.
