Surat: A resident of Firdaush Tower in Adajan, where the earth caved-in killing two construction labourers and injuring four others here on Friday, had raised an alarm over illegal construction through the online complaint platform of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) on March 19, 2017, but no action was taken. Congress councillor Aslam Cyclewala wants strict legal action against concerned officers of Central Town Development Office (CTDO) along with the contractor, owner, engineer and architect of the under-construction building. TOI has access to the online complaint filed by Imran Karu, a resident of Firdaus Tower at Adajan Patia, through complaint id: 999/520173670 on March 19, 2017. The complaint was forwarded by the West Zone to Central Town Development Office (CTDO) for immediate action. In his complaint, Karu stated that he stays at Firdaush Tower and that construction work has started in front of his C building gate where the contractor has excavated 40 feet of earth, which was dangerous to the structural stability of his building.  On March 18, the compound wall of Firdaush tower had caved-in and the drainage and water pipelines were damaged.  “We were told to evacuate the building. There are around 30 families living in 30 flats in the apartment and we have become homeless overnight after the earth cave-in incident. The builders, architects and SMC officers are hand-in-glove. They should be punished for their corrupt practices and negligence,” said Karu. Cyclewala told TOI, “I want the municipal commissioner to initiate legal action against his officers for allowing the builder and architect to construct illegal building. Congress is demanding suspension of CTDO and other responsible officers.”  Meanwhile, Congress workers submitted a memorandum to city police commissioner Satish Sharma demanding that a complaint be lodged against deputy municipal commissioner, Ketan Patel, for protecting the builders.
