MARGAO: The differences between the two coalition partners in the Manohar Parrikar-led coalition government over the move to install Opinion Poll stalwart Jack Sequeira’s statue in the assembly complex took a new turn with town and country planning ( ) minister Vijai   on Thursday urging his cabinet colleague Ramkrishna (Sudin) Dhavalikar to change Goa’s oldest regional party’s nomenclature to Mogall Goenkar (Loving Goans) Party.

 Sardesai requested Dhavalikar to accept his proposal of installing the statue of Goa’s first Opposition Leader  , popularly known as ‘Father of the Opinion Poll’, in the Goa legislative assembly as a ‘golden opportunity’ to clearly declare his position as a ‘Goenkarwad’ (pro-Goan) and not as the ‘M’ in his Maharashtrwadi Gomantak Party ( ).
 
 Sardesai made these remarks while speaking as chief guest during the ‘Opinion Poll Golden Jubilee celebrations’ organised by Dalgado Konknni Akademi (DKA) at Ravindra Bhavan conference hall, Margao.
 
 The TCP minister said he ‘earnestly hoped’ that all legislators would unite and agree to install Sequeira’s statue. He aplogised when former United Goans (UG) Party St   MLA Teotonio Pereira pointed out to the omission of the names of UG party stalwarts who participated in the Opinion Poll movement. 
 
 Heritage activist Prajal Sakhardande, while delivering the key note address, requested Sardesai to convey to the government the need to name the new   bridge after Sequeira, who was Panaji’s first MLA. 
 
 DKA president Tomazinho Cardozo criticised chief minister   for his silence over the demand for intalling Sequeira’s statue, and Dhavalikar for opposing the move. 
 
 Educationist M K Shaikh also spoke on the occasion.
