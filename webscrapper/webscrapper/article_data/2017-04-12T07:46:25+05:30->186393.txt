NEW DELHI: Nearly a dozen election petitions have landed before the Delhi high court against rejection of nomination papers of several candidates for the upcoming municipal elections.

 A majority of the petitioners are candidates from the BJP who want the court to intervene and set aside the decision of the returning officers (ROs) deputed by the state election commission (SEC).
 
 However, till now only one petitioner — a BJP candidate — has been granted relief when the HC last week held a special hearing to permit   to contest from Trilokpuri ward. At the same time pleas of four other BJP nominees and one Congress candidate were rejected.
 
 As more and more candidates line up in HC to challenge the rejection of their nomination by the SEC, chances of success of their petitions appears bleak, in light of two verdicts from the court on Tuesday. In both cases, the court dismissed petitions pointing out that issues raised can only be heard by way of an election petition, which are taken up once polling process is over.
 
 In the first case, Pinki Kumari approached the court challenging the RO’s decision to reject her nomination papers on the ground that the name of her caste ‘Bairwa’ does not fall under the Scheduled Caste list of the government.
 
 But Justice V K Rao agreed with the stand of the SEC counsel Sumeet Pushkarna that since scrutiny of nomination papers has already taken place and a final list of candidates published, the courts should not interfere in electoral matters at this stage.
