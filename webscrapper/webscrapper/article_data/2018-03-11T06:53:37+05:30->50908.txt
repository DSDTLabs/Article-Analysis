HYDERABAD:   Joint Action Committee chairman   said his campaign at the grassroots was eroding the political base of TRS and this has triggered the police crackdown on supporters at the behest of the state government. 

 On at least six occasions, Telangana police over several months denied permission to exercise his basic democratic right to hold public meetings.
 
 Speaking to STOI, Prof   said many those who participated in the Telangana statehood agitation feel betrayed by the TRS government and have aligned with TJAC. "The ruling regime feels our incessant campaign will impact its political base as we side with the truth. On many occasions, police have informally told us that they are not independent to take decisions since government intervenes and ensures permission is denied," said Kodandaram. 
 
 It all started when Kodandaram first decided to organise a Nirudyoga Nirasana rally in February 2017 against the TRS in Hyderabad. Though he was yet to announce his politics plunge at that time, police raided this house at dawn and took him into police custody. Cops also damaged furniture in his house. Supporters of Kodandaram had then exposed the police excesses with live-streaming on Facebook.
 
 On May 2017, after protests and requests in support of Save Dharna Chowk at Indira Park, Hyderabad police granted permission, but were exposed when a woman officer in mufti was caught holding a placard in support of moving the protest site to the outskirts.
 
 Kodandaram had to face more problem during his plan to take up Amarula Sphoorthi Yatra, He had planned a two-day visit to districts, but this wasn't allowed.
