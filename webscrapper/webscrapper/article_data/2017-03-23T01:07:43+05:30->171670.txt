NEW DELHI: For the workers who look after Delhi University’s rugby ground, a   has been an unlikely source of a  , which many claim is as sweet as any refreshments they can get their hands on.

 A neem tree has, since November 2016 been exuding a white liquid which many have started consuming, but experts said that the drink may be harmful as there is no “certainty of its composition yet”.
 
 Though neem tree is known for its medicinal properties and is used for a variety of things, including detoxification of fungal area and treatment of skin diseases, professor of botany at DU   said old trees often exude a sap which contains sugar, amino acid and organic acid.
 
 Pandey warned that the sweet liquid might be problematic for many.
 
  “The sugar — if it ferments — will certainly turn into alcohol and the sweetness of the liquid might not be good for people suffering from diabetes,” he said.
 
 He also said that saps have microbes and may have toxic bacteria in them. “So it should be consumed only after chemical tests and recommendations from an avurvedic practitioner,” he added.
 
 Head gardener Mahesh Prasad said, “The white liquid smells of toddy and has some bitter taste to it. Some people tied up a bucket on the trunk to collect and consume it for later.”
 
 Nirmala, one of the workers, said that she tried out the drink twice as she thought it will have medicinal properties. “It was a little sweet and I thought it would help relieve stomach ailments but I haven’t tried it again for many days now.”
 
 The guards have also stopped people from coming and taking the  , warning them that it would affect them poorly as “there is no proof that it is harmless.”
