NOIDA: Two youths were   with old   with a face value of Rs 7 lakh at   in Sector 26 on Friday night. An FIR is yet to be lodged against the two accused.

 According to the police, the youths were apparently engaged in a scuffle with two Hindu Yuva Vahini functionaries — Meerut mandal incharge Vivek Singh and   mahanagar president Sachin Chauhan — when the police searched their vehicles and recovered the currency.

 While Pawan owns a pharmacy in Surajpur, Ankul owns a mobile shop in Savitri market in Sector 18. Arun is Pawan’s friend, the police said.
 
 “The money, recovered from the Chevrolet Cruze, belonged to Ankul. We have informed the I-T department about the case,” said Anil Shai, SHO, Sector 20 police station.
 
 The police were yet to lodge an FIR in the matter and said the I-T department would decide what action would be taken against the accused. “A case will be lodged only if the I-T department wants it,” said Arun Kumar, SP (city).
 
 However, the I-T department denied the claims of the Noida police. “We have not received any such information,” M K Jain, joint commissioner, income tax department, told TOI.
 
 Another senior I-T department official said the police should have lodged a case against the accused.
