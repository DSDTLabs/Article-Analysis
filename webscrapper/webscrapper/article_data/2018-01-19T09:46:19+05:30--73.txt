JAIPUR: After a  ,   on Thursday moved an application before the local court on the withdrawal of case against   chief  .

 Gangapur city additional SP Yogendra Faujdar informed TOI that the court was informed about the government’s order pertaining to the withdrawal of cases against Togadia. However, he said that it’s up to the court to decide on the application. 
 
 Sawai Madhopur district collector KC Verma on Wednesday night had issued directions to the prosecutor to inform that the government had withdrawn the case in 2015.
 
 The matter had come to light on Tuesday when it was found that the case charged by the police against Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Praveen Togadia had been withdrawn three years ago by the state government.
 
 The state police had gone to Ahmedabad on Monday to arrest Togadia in a case against him and 16 others in 2002 for violating Section 144 of the CrPC. The bureaucratic blunder saw the order withdrawing charges against the VHP leader never reaching the court which went on hearing the case and issued multiple summons.
 
 The state government had pulled up the district police and administration for failing to act on its order issued three years ago. After the issue became a national controversy, the police and district officials went through mounts of paper and found that they had been pursuing a case that has already been withdrawn by the government.
 
 “As soon as it was reported, I asked the prosecution officer to inform the court,” collector Verma told TOI over phone.
 
 The officials told TOI that it was a major blunder committed at the district level,” The letter was issued on June 9, 2015, but it seems that both the collector and SP were woefully uninformed,” the official said.
