MAHWA: In what came as a surprise to   recipient Karanbir Singh, cricketer turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu visited his home and presented him with a cash award of Rs 1 lakh. 

 Sidhu, who spent the money from his own pocket, announced that he would get the bridge from where a school bus plunged into a drain on September 20, 2016, repaired. The accident left seven children, including four girl students, dead and many others injured. Karanbir happened to be travelling in the same bus and helped a number of students reach ashore safely. 
 
 “This young hero is a role model for others, who will be inspired by him to extend a helping hand in trying times. I am honored to meet the champion of courage, Karanbir, who did every Punjabi proud,” said Sidhu after meeting Karanbir. To honour the 17-year-old, Sidhu announced the formation of a Karanbir Committee to look into repairs of bridges. 
 
 “I feel very proud upon receiving the award and to find Sidhu coming all the way to meet me,” he said, adding that it was his heartfelt desire to repair damaged bridges. He said he had also apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the condition of bridges near the Indo-Pak international border. 
 
 Sidhu also visited Mahwa bridge, where repair work was stalled for want of Rs 3 lakh and announced a government grant of Rs 5 lakh besides a separate grant of Rs 5 lakh for another dilapidated bridge. 
 
 Earlier in the day, Sidhu launched a cleanliness campaign of the holy city beginning from the vicinity of Golden Temple.
