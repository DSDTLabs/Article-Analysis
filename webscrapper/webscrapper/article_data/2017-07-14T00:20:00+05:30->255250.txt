Margao: Shrimad Vidyadhiraj Teerth Sripad Vader Swami, the chief pontiff of the Gokarn Partagal Jeevottam Mutt, Partagal, Canacona, and his disciple Swami Srimad Vidyadheesh Teerth will undertake the auspicious Chaturmas ritual beginning today. 

 Significantly, this will be after 49 long years that the Partagal mutt will witness both the swami and his successor-disciple observing the Chaturmas together. It was in 1967 and 1968, soon after the initiation of Shrimad Vidyadhiraj Teerth Swami into the sanyasharam, that he along with his guru Swami Shrimad Dwarkanath Teerth observed Chaturmas at the Partagal mutt.
 
 On his appointment as the chief pontiff, Shrimad Vidyadhiraj Teerth Swami observed Chaturmas at the Partagal mutt in 1974 and 1975, sources said. 
 
 Chaturmas is a period of four holy months of the Hindu calendar beginning from Shayani Ekadashi of Ashadh, the fourth month, until Prabodhini Ekadashi of Kartik, the eighth month. To facilitate the observance of all rituals and performance of ‘sadhana’ (meditation) at one place and in solitude, the sanyasis go to stay at another place which serves as a retreat. During this auspicious period, the sanyasis stay at one place and give discourses to the masses for bringing them closer to the Almighty. Nevertheless, because of exigencies of time, sanyasis now prefer to observe Chaturmas for a curtailed period of four fortnights.
 
 This year, the Swami has chosen to observe the Chaurturmas at Partagal mutt itself after 42 long years. 
 
 The Chaturmas rituals will begin at 9am on Friday and end with a discourse by the swami at 6pm.
 
 On August 20 a blood donation camp will be organized, the organizers informed, adding that a free eye check up camp and a medical check-up camp will also be held at later dates.
