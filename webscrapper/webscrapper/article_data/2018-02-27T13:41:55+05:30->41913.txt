Madurai: The city   has started acting tough on encroachments inside the MGR bus terminal at   and illegal parking of two-wheelers inside the terminal. On Monday morning, corporation commissioner   inspected the bus terminal, ordered eviction of encroachments from platforms and slapped a fine of Rs 500 on a two-wheeler owner, who had parked the vehicle right in front of the shop at the concourse area.

 The eateries in the concourse area often encroach the pathways with dining tables and the civic authority conducts raids now and then. A week ago, commissioner Aneesh Sekhar inspected the bus terminus and found the usual scene of eateries encroaching the pathways and warned them to remove the encroachments. 
 
 On Monday morning, when he inspected the terminus the encroachments were still in place. He ordered clear the encroachments by eight eateries and their commodities kept on the pathways were removed by corporation officials. Upon finding a two-wheeler parked in front of a shop a spot fine of Rs 500 was slapped on the owner.   instructed officials to slap spot fine on all two-wheeler owners parked inside the terminus. Going forward, no two wheelers will be allowed to be parked in the terminus, he said. 
 
 The shop owners were also instructed to keep two coloured bins in front of their shops to segregate biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste at source itself. 
 
  Assistant commissioner Ramesh, executive engineers Rajendran and Chandrasekar, health officers Sivasubramanian and Nagaraj, assistant executive engineers Sharbudeen and Indra Devi and corporation officials accompanied the commissioner.
