THANE: A day after hundreds of   were found floating in Hari Om Nagar’s highly contaminated and toxic  , the officials of the   ( ) visited the spot on Friday and cleaned the water.

 The civic officials put a large quantum of potassium permanganate in the lake to balance its toxicity levels on Friday. Even though the lake is now relatively clean, citizens and local corporators feel that it is high that the TMC and BCM get together and solve the increasing pollution problem.
 
 “While this lake lies towards the Mumbai side of the Thane-Mumbai (Mulund) boundary, it was beautified by the TMC in 2013 as it was used for Visarjan. The civic authorities, however, clean the lake only twice a year as the area does not fall under their jurisdiction, even though the lake does,” said Kisan Jadhav, a resident who has been taking care of this lake. The main reason for the lake getting polluted is due to a leakage in a BMC nullah. “ A major part of the pollution is because of the leaking BMC nullah that runs near it. The walls of this nallah are broken and crumbling in various parts. The two civic bodies will have to come together to resolve these two issues,” said Kopri corporator (BJP) Bharat Chavan.
 
 While these locals and citizens’ representatives believe that the two civic bodies should jointly find a solution to this problem, the officials from the Thane pollution control department said that the two departments will take the required action separately. “While the area falls under Mumbai, we beautified the Bhoir lake in 2013 with the permission of the BMC. We will be informing the BMC about the leakages in the nullah, after which they will carry out the necessary repairs,” said Manisha Pradhan, pollution control officer at the TMC.
