 has just wrapped up the portions of director Rafi’s upcoming comedy Role Models. 

 The actor plays an engineer named Gautham in the movie, who is the “perfect youth”.
  The director had earlier told us that Gautham grew up under the strict supervision of his parents played by Renji Panicker and Seetha. “He is their only child and they being college lecturers are of the opinion that if their son mingles too much with other students, he will go astray. So, they enrol him in the same college where they teach,” says the director.
 
  The film shows Fahadh in different phases of Gautham’s life — as a college student and later as an engineer. While his parents’ protectiveness keep Gautham away from all vices, Rafi says, it also robs him of the basic skillsets to freely interact with people.
  “He isn’t a social person and a few of his college mates, who were considered the thallippoli group in the campus, come together to help him and they head to Goa. Basically, it’s a journey to set straight the life of a guy, who is too good,” Rafi narrates.
 
  The “freak group” consists of characters played by Vinayakan, Sharafudheen, Vinay Forrt and Srinda. The film, which has   playing the female lead, was shot in Ernakulam, Trivandrum, Goa and UP.
