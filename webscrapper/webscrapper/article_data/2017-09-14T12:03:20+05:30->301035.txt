VADODARA: Veteran   member and former Vadodara mayor as well as Sayajigunj MLA Dalsukh   joined the BJP on Wednesday. A series of other Congress members supporting Prajapati also joined the party at the state BJP headquarters.

 Prajapati had been sulking in the Congress and his son Vishnu Prajapati has already joined the BJP. His other son   did so on Wednesday. Ahead of the last parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s brother Somabhai Modi had attended Prajapati’s birthday celebrations in the city in April 2015.
 
 Prajapati had quit the Congress in 2015 too, but had not joined any political party after that. He returned to the Congress early this year.
 
 After joining the BJP on Wednesday, Prajapati said that he was joining the BJP as he believed that Modi was working hard for the country. “In the past, even he had asked me to join the party,” Prajapati said. He added that Congress was riddled with infighting.
 
 Prajapati said that he had laid no conditions for joining the BJP. “I want to work for the party. I am already involved with a lot of social work, particularly in the field of education. I will continue with it,” he said.
 
 He has a stronghold in the Gorwa and surrounding areas of the city. He was a Congress corporator from a ward in the area and went on to win a by-election to the assembly from the Sayajigunj seat in 2002.
 
 Prajapati had lost the assembly general elections from Sayajigunj later in the same year in the post-Godhra riots wave. He even lost the 2005 municipal elections and has been struggling since then. His brother   contested the 2007 assembly polls unsuccessfully from Sayajigunj constituency from the Congress.
 
 Prajapati claimed that a series of leaders from the city and rural areas also joined the BJP with him. He had taken them to the BJP state headquarters in buses and cars.
