 The bridge connects Katargam to Gorat road in Adajan. The construction work on the Rs 237 crore bridge was completed two months ago. However, the ruling BJP leaders in SMC were confused about its inauguration due to the ongoing controversy over streetlight contract for the bridge.
 
 Congress councillor Dinesh Kachadiya had set the deadline for the bridge’s inauguration on September 30. Sensing trouble, the ruling BJP leaders decided to inaugurate the bridge on the same day. 
 
 Kachadiya said, “The people of Adajan and Katargam were facing a lot of trouble due to SMC authorities not opening the completed bridge. Hence, I decided to open the bridge on September 30.”
