 "It all started when the old man started shouting and swearing at a passenger and his wife and then he punched that passenger," a passenger told the daily.
 
 "Then one flight attendant tried to break it off, and that old man pushed her violently, another flight attendant came to help and the man punched her. This is when the young man in the video got involved and tried to stop the old man," the passenger said.
 
 "After other passengers also stopped him, the old man kept swearing at everyone for a while. After about 15 minutes, everyone calmed down and went back to their seats. The old man then asked to go to the toilet and he walked towards the young guy and that's where the video started," the passenger added.
