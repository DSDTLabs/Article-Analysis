Ludhiana: A 17-year-old   died under mysterious circumstances here on Monday night. 

 The family of Bhagirath, 17, a resident of Rajpura colony, has accused his employer of throwing his body outside their house after murdering him. His employer Sushil Kumar, however, said Bhagirath was unwell and they dropped him home after helping him with medication.
 
 “Bhagirath had been working as a domestic help at a house in Shaheed Udham Singh Nagar for the past six months. He had not been going to work for the past three days, as the employer’s wife ill-treated and abused him. On Monday around 1pm, the employer’s wife came to our house and took him along for work. Around 10.30pm, his employer pulled over his car outside our house, threw Bhagirath out and sped away. His body was cold. One of our neighbourers called an ambulance. He was taken to civil hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” said Kamini, Bhagirath’s sister. 
 
 The teenager’s kin gathered outside his employer’s house to seek answers on Tuesday morning. As tempers frayed, they staged a protest. Division number 8 police reached the spot and pacified the agitators.
 
 The family has lodged a compliant with the DMC police post. 
 
 Sushil Kumar, a hosiery businessman, however, told the police, “Bhagirath was unwell. We helped him with medication after he threw up and dropped him home.”
 
 Division number 8 police station SHO inspector Pawan Kumar said, “Statements of both the accused as well as the victim’s kin are being verified. The post-mortem report will make things clear.” 
 
 The police are also checking the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the locality. 
 
 Later in the day, Bhagirath’s kin again took to streets to register protest. Congress leader Rajiv Raja, too, joined the stir. As the agitators blocked PAU-Rose Garden road, the traffic came to a grinding halt. They lifted the protest after police assured to thoroughly investigate the case.
