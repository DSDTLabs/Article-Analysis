INDORE: An   is flourishing in the city and it is easy to procure a gun if you have the money and right contacts. From simple kattas ( ) to sophisticated automatics, everything's available for prices ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 2 lakh.

 Semi-automatic sophisticated pistols of 7.65 mm bore and magazines made in MP have also been seized outside in different states.   for the MP-made weapons are on rise across the country, if official figures of weapon seized in different parts are anything to go by. 
 
 In contrast to the much cheaper country-made pistols, the MP-made 9mm and .32 bores are sold for at least Rs 20,000 each.
 
 The trade has changed in some ways over the last decade. For one, it does not cater to only gangsters any more. People who want to show off in their group also buy or rent weapons, claim crime branch officials. 
 
 The crime branch alone recovered SLRs, carbines and double-barrel guns while busting different organised gangs across the district. The growth of hundreds of   units on the city's outskirts and in neighbouring towns has made the problem complex.
 
 An officer told TOI that illegal weapons outnumber legal ones in the city eight to one, and more than 90% of violent crimes are committed using unlicensed guns. 
 
 According to a senior official, the katta remains the weapon of choice as it is the easiest to dispose of after a crime. "It is almost impossible to link a katta with a crime or a criminal unless there is a clear set of fingerprints," the officer said.
