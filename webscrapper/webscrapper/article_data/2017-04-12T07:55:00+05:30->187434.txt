PATIALA: A probe to investigate the graft charges against Punjabi Universityâ€™s deputy controller of   (DCLA)   was initiated by inquiry officer   on Tuesday. In this context he had an interaction with re-employed professors in this regard.

 He verified the statements given by the re-employed teachers, in which they confirmed that Kartar had demanded Rs 20,000 from each of them to clear their salary bills. Kartar was also present in the meeting.
 
 Prof Jaswinder Singh while speaking on behalf of the re-employed professors body highlighted the alleged irregularities and excesses committed by Kartar. The   Re-employed Professors Association (PURPA) demanded that the scope of inquiry should be widened to include corrupt practices of many other officials on different ranks. The acts committed by the DCLA were just the tip of the iceberg, they alleged.
 
 Srivastava acceded to their demand to widen the scope of inquiry and fixed April 25 as the next date to collect additional evidence against the DCLA and his other accomplices.
