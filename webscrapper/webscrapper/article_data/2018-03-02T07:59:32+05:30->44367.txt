CHENNAI:   chief minister   on Thursday sought the intervention of Prime Minister   to remove the recently-introduced restrictive clauses for the handloom weavers' cooperative societies to avail of marketing incentives under  . 

 In the previous scheme, there was neither time limitation nor sales turnover as eligibility criteria, making it easier for the societies to avail of the incentives. The present scheme, however, introduced two restrictive clauses, which would mean the societies can avail of incentives for a maximum of three years and turnover should not be more than Rs 30 lakh. "By capping the sales turnover to Rs 30 lakh, the sale of handloom goods will be affected to a large extent, which will impact the existence of the societies itself. There will not be any cash flow to the societies, and continuous employment of weavers would be affected ultimately," the CM said, in a letter to Modi.
 
 The sustenance of weaving activity would get disturbed, which would lead to migration of weavers seeking other sources of employment, besides accumulation of stock of handloom goods, and loss of working capital. Going by the new guidelines, the Tamil Nadu government has estimated that only 285 societies, consisting of 53,140 weavers in the state, would become eligible for getting financial assistance. The previous guidelines helped 868 societies consisting of 2.69 lakh weavers. The societies in the state have been heavily dependent on the marketing incentive to promote sales for many decades, Palaniswami said.
 
 "Moreover, societies with a turnover of more than Rs 30 lakh also have a significant number of members and, therefore, would also need marketing support to face stiff competition from the powerloom sector," the CM said.
