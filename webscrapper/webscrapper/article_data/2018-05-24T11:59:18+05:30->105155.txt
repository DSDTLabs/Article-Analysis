NEW DELHI: Fortis   shareholders had voted in favour of the removal of   from the board of directors in the company’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM) held on Tuesday.

 
 Tempest is among the four directors of the healthcare major whose removals were sought by two institutional investors. Three directors — Harpal Singh, Sabina Vaisoha and Tejinder Singh Shergill — have already resigned before the EGM.
 
 The EGM also approved appointment of Suvalaxmi Chakraborty, Ravi Rajagopal and lndrajit Banerjee as independent directors on the board. The restructuring of   board would cast a shadow over the decision taken on May 10 to sell around 16.5% stake in the company to the   family for Rs 1,800 crore at an average price of Rs 172 per share.
 
 With the new board now in place, it is believed that the bidding process would start afresh. In a regulatory filing, Fortis said the resolution for removal of Tempest as director was passed with 88% vote in favour. Despite the board’s recommendation on May 10, Manipal Hospitals-TPG revised its offer on May 14 to invest Rs 2,100 crore and increased the offer price for subscription of preferential allotment of shares to Rs 180 from Rs 160.
 
 IHH Healthcare had increased its offer to directly invest in Fortis at Rs 175 per share on May 1 compared to an initial non-binding proposal to invest at Rs 160 per share. IHH Healthcare has also written a letter to the Fortis board expressing its desire to further participate in the bidding process. The group is likely to submit a revised offer soon.
