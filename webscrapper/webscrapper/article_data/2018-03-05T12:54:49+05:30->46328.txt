TUTICORIN:   on water which was expected to be the key attraction during the adventure sports festival turned out to be disappointing as it could not be organised on all three days at   due to the gusty winds. At one point there was pressure from district administration officials to organise the event on Saturday so that the crowd would not be disappointed, but the organisers refused to do so owing to safety concerns.

 Director of Indian Aero Sports and Science ‘Glider’ Babu said that wind blew in three directions, which is not conducive for the water sport. "Wind has been bad for over a week. The boat that was supposed to be used for the event is only about 750 kilograms. The parachute we use can lift up to a tonne," he said and added that there have been bad experiences in the past in   in which people involved in parasailing have got killed and badly injured due to rough weather.
 
 Organisers recalled that about five years ago a jeep, with a man on the parachute, was lifted and dragged for about a kilometre before they were lucky to land in a parasailing event organised in   district. Luckily nobody was injured in the incident.
 
 Owner of the boat that was to be used for the event, P  , 34, a fisherman of Manapad, said that they needed a waterway for about a kilometre to facilitate the take-off and landing of the parachute with the person. "The water level was below the required depth of around five-feet. So there are chances that the propeller may hit the river or sea bed," he added.
 
 Zorbing was the only other event in which youth, especially fisher folk, enthusiastically participated. Boys also tried river crossing, sans river, wherein they crossed from one point to the other with protective gear.
