BHOPAL: A PhD scholar at   has developed a nano-technology based invention to cut down the impact of   from   on human beings. 

 Touseef Ahmad Para was awarded the ‘best scientist award’ for his zinc oxide technology at the Young Scientist Congress held by Madhya Pradesh Council of Science and Technology (MPCST) in Bhopal recently.
 
 His invention is cheaper than the costly phosphor that acts as a shield against UV rays, he said, adding that it will not only help check the impact of UV rays on humans but also reduce the cost of LEDs as more households and offices switch to LED.
 
 “The people-friendly technology was developed in 2016 keeping in mind the harmful effects of UV rays,” said Touseef, a native of Kashmir. Exposure to UV rays can cause skin cancer, loss of eyesight and ruin food material, the 27-year-old inventor pointed out. 
 
 “The use of LEDs will grow exponentially because they consume less energy and are durable. Households are switching to LED and the government has launched multiple schemes to promote this technology. However, all LEDs generate UV rays. Phosphor is being used as a UV shield but it’s very expensive. Zinc oxide nano provides a cheaper alternative,” he said, adding that Madhya Pradesh is rich in zinc ore.
 
 Most white light LEDs are generally phosphor-coated blue LEDs, so there is always a risk of UV leak, especially in the cheaper varieties, he said. 
 
 In the future, homes are bound to get greater UV exposure than ever before. “In this regard our material is very efficient in absorbing UV-rays and thereby converting it into violet-blue light. This property can be exploited by LED manufacturing companies in designing low cost UV-proof LEDs,” he added. 
 
  scientific officer Vilas Shelke backed Touseef’s statement and said, “His work has worth. It can help remove UV rays from any kind of LED. It is a proven phenomenon.”
