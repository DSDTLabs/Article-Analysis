VASCO: South Goa   vice-president   alias Daji on Thursday resigned from his post and the party soon after   was declared as the BJP candidate for Vasco. Salkar, who was vying for the ticket, claimed that 30 office-bearers of the   mandal and 1,000 active volunteers also resigned. 

 “Almeida has failed drastically on the development front. Vasco has been treated like an orphan although its MLA is from the ruling dispensation,” Salkar said.
