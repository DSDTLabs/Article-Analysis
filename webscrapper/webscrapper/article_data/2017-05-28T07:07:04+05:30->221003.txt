LUCKNOW: The cauldrons are half empty and the massive pans that would otherwise be piled high with juicy kababs are now running low as the first eve of Ramzan beckons food lovers to the lanes of old Lucknow. It is a sombre mood in the many bylanes of Chowk, Nakkhas and Aminabad with iconic eateries including Tunday Kababi and Raheem Hotel struggling with short supply of meat. 

 With buffalo meat out of hand in the aftermath of the ban on illegal slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh, both Tunday's signature kababs and Raheem's kulchey-nihari will stay off the tables.
 
 As the sale of gastronomic delights fell 30%-40% in the past few months, eateries fear an even sharper decline in business this Ramzan - a month that otherwise witnessed manifold increase in sales with people, both local and tourists, thronging the streets to grab a bite. 
 
 "We are forced to shift to chicken that cost us 40% of our clients. The government should take into consideration Ramzan, and give us the meat. We fear losing our heritage and our legacy," said Abu Bakr, one of the owners of Tunday Kababi. 
 
 Sharing the sentiment, owner of Mubeen's Restaurant, Shoeb Rizwan said, " Buff shauk ka masla nahi hai, gareebi ka masla hai (Consuming buffalo meat is not a matter of desire alone, but of poverty where for the poor it is the most affordable form of protein)." 
 
 Famous for its biryani, the owner of Idrees Hotel, Abu Bakr said, "This will not just affect those who come here to break the fast in the evening ( iftaar). Those on fast will eat something or the other in the evening. But for those others who came to this part of the city for the experience that Ramzan brought with it in its evenings and the tourists that the state got during this time of the year because of that, will be affected hugely. It will break our city's tradition."
