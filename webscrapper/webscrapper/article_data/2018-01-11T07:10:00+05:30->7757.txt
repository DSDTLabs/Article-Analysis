GHAZIABAD: Days after a dispute broke out over the installation of a statue of Dr   on the district court premises, a group of lawyers raised a demand on Wednesday to install a statute of Mahatma Gandhi.

 A group of around 40 lawyers affiliated to the UP bar council and Ghaziabad bar association submitted a memorandum to SSP  , demanding that a Gandhi statute be installed on the court premises.
 
 “Mahatma Gandhi was not only the pioneer of Dalit renaissance in India but was also a qualified and able barrister. Our district court already has a statue of Chaudhary Charan Singh. Young lawyers have unequivocally extended their support to install the Gandhi statue within the district court,” lawyers’ representative   told TOI.
 
 Police said the memorandum will be forwarded to state government agencies for necessary action.
