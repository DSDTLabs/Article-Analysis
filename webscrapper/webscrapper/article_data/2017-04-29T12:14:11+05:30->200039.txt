INDORE: Directing the   to forward the name of a   candidate for appointment as assistant   (ADPO), the   of   high court ordered the state government to issue the petitioner’s appointment letter within sixty days.

 The order was passed by Justice SC Sharma, allowing two petitions filed by candidates who had been selected and were in the waiting list for the post of ADPO.
 
 A request seeking their recommendation letters was moved by the state government on March 31, 2012. Denying the request, the PSC replied to the request in September 2012, stating the validity of the two candidates had ended on September 7 and hence recommendation letters could not be issued.
