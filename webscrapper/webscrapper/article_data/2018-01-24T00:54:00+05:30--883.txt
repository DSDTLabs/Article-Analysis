Kanyakumari: Sloganeering BJP and AIADMK cadres at the railway function brought out the divisions among political parties over setting up the International Container Transhipment Terminal (ICTT) in the district. 

 Tense moments prevailed as BJP activists raised slogans when Colachel MLA JG Prince (Congress) reached the venue and spoke. The Colachel MLA was among those who strongly opposed the Enayam ICTT project, which was dropped and is now proposed to be established near Kovalam. BJP cadre continued hooting and raising slogans such as ‘Bharat Matha Ki Jai’ so loudly as to drown the MLA’s offering of felicitations. Prince made a general statement that the leaders should know what they ought to do and identify those works that benefit the people and welfare of the district. However, he had to wrap up his speech in the next few moments.
 
 BJP cadres also raised slogans in praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister of state for finance and shipping and Kanyakumari MP Pon Radhakrishnan started speaking after the MLAs. Tense moments prevailed as AIADMK cadre near the stage also started chanting ‘Puratchi Thalaivi Ammavuku Jai’. It was then that Radhakrishnan asked all cadre to stop slogans. “We (leaders on the stage) are united like brothers. If we are divided like you, Kanyakumari will become a cremation ground,” he said. 
 
 Radhakrishnan pointed out that there have been far more heated arguments during debates in the parliament. “But we leave behind political differences and have open chats in the Central Hall,” he said and told MLAs from other political parties on stage to join hands for projects for the betterment of the district. The minister also pointed out that leaders of Kerala were united for a common cause for the welfare of the people and that Kanyakumari should set an example for such political unity in Tamil Nadu.
