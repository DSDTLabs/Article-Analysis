Referring to the medical report submitted by JJ Hospital doctors, the court said, “It is reported that there is no evidence of psychopathology at present. The report reveals the conclusion of no evidence of  . It also reveals opinion that accused is fit to stand trial.” 

 On May 23, 2017, inspector Dnyaneshwar Ganore found his wife Deepali’s body in their Santacruz (E) flat with a   drawn in blood next to her with the words, “Tired of her. Catch me and hang me”. Their son Siddhant was arrested two days later from a hotel in Jodhpur. 
 
 The plea submitted by Dyaneshwar sought his son’s release under CrPC Section 330 which allows the release of a person of unsound mind pending investigation or trial. The court then directed the prison authorities to refer Siddhant to psychiatrists. The report was submitted by two assistant professors from the psychology and psychiatry departments and a senior resident from psychiatry department of JJ Hospital. —Rebecca Samervel
