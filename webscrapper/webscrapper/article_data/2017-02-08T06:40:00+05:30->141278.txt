NAGPUR: About 30 lakh cases of ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) or acute heart attacks occur in the country annually. Of these, only 55-60,000 (about 2%) get essential treatment or primary angioplasty done within 3-24 hours of the attack.

 But Tamil Nadu has developed and implemented a successful model of STEMI care system in the state since 2012 and reduced mortality (death) rate substantially. Other states like Telangana and Karnataka are in the process of adopting this model with government support. In Maharashtra, Nagpur and Aurangabad are planning to take the lead to replicate the STEMI model in near future. But it will require a lot of concerted team work from cardiac physicians.
 
 Dr   from Nagpur and Dr Ajit Bhagwat from Aurangabad told TOI that they were studying the TN-STEMI model and would try to adopt it first in the two cities as a trial model. But for this the entire paraphernalia, including insurance system, ambulance service and hospitals with facility to treat STEMI, has to be in place.
 
 Dr Mullasari Ajit, director of cardiology at The Madras Medical Mission, which is running the model in TN, told TOI that doctors from various states were wishing to adopt the model. He was in the city to attend a CME by the Association of Physicians of India — Vidarbha chapter on STEMI (diagnosis, complications and management of  ).
 
 Dr Ajit said that TN was in the process of publishing the results of the model from 2012 and hence would not be able to share the exact data of the success rate. “But surely, STEMI model has been extremely successful and can now be implemented across all geographic boundaries. Cardiac physicians only need to convert the challenge in hand into an opportunity and replicate the model in any state,” said Dr Ajit.
 
 In TN, this is called as a Hub and spoke model. It was first implemented in Coimbatore. It basically included four hubs (big hospitals) and 40 spokes (small hospitals). “A heart attack patient under this system is transported using government ambulance system like 108 within maximum three hours from a spoke to a hub (with cath lab facility) after giving primary treatment which means giving a clot bursting drug and stabilizing patient and transporting for primary angioplasty to an equipped hospital which treats patients with insurance system like   in Maharashtra. Patient here receives the intervention within 24 hours of the attack,” said Dr Ajit.
 
 Dr Bhagwat and Dr Jagtap however admit that this is easier said than done. It requires to develop a network of intensive cardiac care units (ICCUs) within fixed distances, ambulance service and network of trained doctors. It also requires a public-private partnership system in place for sharing the responsibility of providing emergency services and cath lab facilities. “Under this model, patients are being treated using STEMI standardized protocols. Hence the model can be replicated in different states with minor differences,” said Dr Jagtap.
 
 Saving life
 
 · Approximately 30 lakh patients suffer from acute heart attack in India annually
 
 · The number is increasing 3-4 times in both, rural and urban areas
 
 · Only 2% (60,000) or less patients reach hospital and are able to get angioplasty or any surgical intervention done
 
 · Patient should reach the treating hospital within three hours of the attack and get intervention with 24 hours
 
 · Data indicates if there is a delay of 30 minutes the mortality is as high as 7.5%
 
 · In Tamil Nadu, 2,420 patients of acute heart attacks were treated in one year (2013-14)
