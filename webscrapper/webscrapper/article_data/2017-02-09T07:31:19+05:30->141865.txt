 The order came on a petition moved by a local NGO — We The People. Its general secretary advocate Prince Lenin had pleaded in the petition that an innocent person lost his life because of the negligence of police.
 
 The petitioner demanded that the probe be handed over to the CBI. It was also said that the state government should implement the ‘Witness Protection Program’ in true spirit.
 
 As soon as the petition was placed up before the bench, even without hearing a word from the petitioner’s counsel, the judges expressed serious concern on the issue to additional advocate general Bulbul Godial and additional government advocate RK Dwivedi . The bench said it was a serious matter and the incident could have been averted if the police were vigilant.
 
 Directing the state machinery to file counter affidavit on the matter, the bench framed questions for reply of the state.
 
 Meanwhile, sources revealed to the TOI that the state government has, in principle, agreed to a CBI probe and SSP   has written to her seniors in this regard.
