The sensational controversy regarding Ram Gopal Varma’s film God, Sex and Truth ( ) took a new turn after the film was taken down from YouTube following a complaint of copyright infringement filed by scriptwriter P Jaya Kumar. Earlier,   had accused Varma of plagiarising his work and said that the film God Sex and Truth was first conceptualised by him. The writer, who worked with RGV in   3, filed an official
complaint against the filmmaker for copyright infringement. 
 “On January 26, when GST was released on YouTube, I had written to them asking them to take it down. I also shared the copy of my official complaint regarding copyright violation. Almost a month later, I have finally received a response from them. What truly vindicates my position is that they have not only taken down the video, but have also acknowledged that it was because of my copyright claim,” Jaya Kumar said. 
 
 And sure enough, the link that RGV had shared, no longer has the video. Instead, it’s replaced with a message which reads “‘RGV’s God, Sex and Truth Tr...’ This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by P Jaya Kumar (sic).” 
 Meanwhile, RGV, who is usually vocal about his opinion, has chosen to stay mum on the issue. The Sarkar helmer instead shared a   quote, which is possibly aimed at his detractors. “If freedom of speech means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear. If some of the ideas do not offend some people there’s no need for that freedom — George Orwell (sic),” RGV tweeted.
