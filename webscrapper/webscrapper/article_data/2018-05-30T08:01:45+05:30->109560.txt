NAGPUR: It was raining congratulations and pleasantries on the Dhok family on Tuesday, as their daughter   emerged as joint city topper in CBSE Std X. Dhok, a student of Narayana Vidyalayam, Chinchbhuvan scored 493/500 marks (98.60%) in the board exam.

 Mihika, a state-level basketball player, had to give up her practice to focus more on studies. “I tried my best to balance both sports and studies but realized that I would become jack of all trades and master of none. I had to channelize all my energy towards studies and the efforts have paid off today. I didn’t expect to be the city topper at all and was taken by surprise after the results were announced. I only expected to be the school topper,” she said.
 
 A daughter of an ophthalmologist mother and a radiologist father,   doesn’t want to follow her parents footsteps. Instead she aspires to become a software engineer. Mihika’s mother   was confident that her daughter would get an excellent score. “She is a very hardworking and sincere child. We never had to worry about Mihika as she is mentally and emotionally very strong. Even during exams, her schoolteachers became her second mothers and that is the real reason behind her success today,” she said.
 
 Talking about her study routine, Mihika said, “I studied for maximum three hours after the school and that was enough for me. If we concentrate in the class every day, 90% of our studies is already done. My teachers at school guided me at every step and that was enough for me.” 
 
 Mihika does like to play the synthesizer sometimes due to interest in music.
