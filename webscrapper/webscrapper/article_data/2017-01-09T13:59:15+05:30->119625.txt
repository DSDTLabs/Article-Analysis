INDORE:   from the   will now be compost to form manure. Hundreds of kilos of vegetables wasted every day at the vegetable market will now be converted into organic manure for gardens and farms. 

 The Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has constructed compost pits at the   near Krishnapura Chatri to turn leftover vegetables into manure.
 
 Four compost pits, each with a capacity of 500 to 700 kg, have been constructed by the IMC where vegetable waste will be dumped every day from nearby vegetable markets.
 
 Rohan Saxena, additional commissioner IMC said, "Everyday several kilos of vegetables and fruits are wasted in the vegetable market. The IMC has to bear additional cost in transporting this waste to the trenching ground. But with the coming up of compost pits,leftover vegetables can be efficiently converted into manure."
 
 According to IMC, leftover vegetables will be dumped into these pits and the waste will get converted into organic manure within 20-25 days with the help of bacteria. Out of the four pits, two pits are ready while the construction of the other two are in progress. Saxena said, "We are hoping to start the use of ready compost pits from early next week."
 
 The IMC is planning to construct compost pits at the places that generate bulk waste so that the waste can be converted into manure.
