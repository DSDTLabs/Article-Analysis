Panaji: Around 500   drivers from North and South Goa gheraoed transport director Nikhil Desai on Friday over the installation drive of speed governors in their vehicles that began a fortnight ago. Desai, however, stood his ground and said the rules would not be relaxed for just one category of transport vehicles. 

 “The Supreme Court committee on road safety is monitoring the issue. They (taxi owners) will have to fall in line. Installation will continue,” Desai said, adding that vehicle fitness certificates wouldn’t be issued until the governors were installed. 
 
 While Desai said the taxi drivers were free to submit representations that would subsequently be put before the Union government, general secretary of the North Goa Tourist Taxi Association Vinayak Nanoskar threatened that cabbies across the state would go on strike if the director didn’t change his stance within a week, starting Monday. “A majority of road accidents involve motorbikes. Why are taxis being targeted? We don’t mind installing speed governors if the rule applies to everyone, including private vehicle owners,” Nanoskar told TOI.
