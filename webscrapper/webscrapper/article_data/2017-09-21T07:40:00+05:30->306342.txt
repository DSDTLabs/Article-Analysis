Panchkula: Two sisters drowned when they were bathing in the   river on Wednesday evening.

 Police said Neetu, 15, and Simmi, 7, both residents of Maheshnagar village in Panchkula, had gone with women from their family, three adults and five children, to the river. Around 6.30 pm, the current of the river got stronger. 
 
 The three women got three of the children out, but Neetu and Simmi had been swept away by the time the women turned around to get them.
 
 The women then rushed for help to a nearby road and phoned police with help from a passerby. Though cops rushed to the spot with a rescue team, it was too late. Police said they received the phone call around 7pm. “During rescue operations, Simmi’s body was recovered from the middle of the river, while the search for the Neetu was still on,” said station house officer (SHO) of Sector 5 police station, Inspector Karambir Singh.
 
 The tragedy has been reported even as Section 144 of the CrPC has been imposed on Ghaggar river by the deputy commissioner of Panchkula. Under the order, nobody one is allowed to go near the river. 
 
 The order had been imposed as many death have been reported due to drowning in the Ghaggar.
 
 On June 19 last year, an 11-year-old boy drowned in the river near Peer Muchalla. The deceased had been identified as Saurav, a resident of Fatehpur village, Sector 21, Panchkula. 
 
 Eleven days after that, two women had drowned in the river. The incident took place near Brijkotia village, when the two girls had gone with their friends for a dip in the river.
