 Shoojit says, "The president saw the movie without any intermission. After watching the movie, he congratulated us and said that he is very happy that we touched on this topic in the film. He also felicitated us and invited us for dinner. It was a really beautiful experience, having dinner with him. We felt like school kids, mesmerised by everything, and Mr Bachchan was like our professor, guiding us."
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 He adds, "It was absolutely surreal. I am from a background where I had no connect with any form of art, and then one day I am in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, showing my film to the president of India! It is still sinking in, even though it was my second visit there. He also invited us to visit the Mughal Gardens and the museum."
