Ahmedabad: Students of NC Bodiwala College protested against the university’s decision to shut down, on Tuesday. The state government’s higher education department issued an order last week to shut down the college, which is in Kalupur. Soon after the order was issued, the management laid off 14 faculty members. Currently, more than 1,500 students are enrolled in the college.

 A signature campaign has been initiated by students. There is no faculty member to either take classes or conduct exams. Students fear that the management will start a self-financed institute next year. In the days to come, students will stage a series of protests. tnn
