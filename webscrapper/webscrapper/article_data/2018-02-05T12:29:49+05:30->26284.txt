BHOPAL: Taj-ul-Masajid, one of the largest mosques in India, is now a mark of change for Swach Bharat campaign. For over a month now,   (BMC) has encouraged staffers and hostelries alike at the Madarsa to segregate waste.

 It does not end at waste segregation at Taj-ul-Masajid. A compost unit has been established near the seven acre campus. “Any kind of organic waste can be turned into compost. The output is being utilised for gardening of the central park,” said BMC ward official, Imtiyaz Khan.
 
 On Sunday, mayor Alok Sharma along with senior BMC officials visited the campus. Sitting in the first row, 12-year-old  , said, “Residue being segregated and utilised is a welcome move. By practicing simple rules, we can keep our surroundings clean.”
 
 Segregation of the waste and motivating city residents to take to waste management of dry and wet waste has been a challenge for the civic body. Holding up two dustbins, marked ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ waste, Sharma has been propagating change – ahead of   survey for 2018.
 
 “Initiatives by the madarsa sets an example for others to follow,” said Sharma who also visited the only remaining cascading waterbody in Bhopal – Motia Talab.
 
 BMC officials undertook the task of cleaning the water body which lies along the masjid.
 
 Part of the   palace compound, there were three cascading lakes in the area. Two of them have been lost to encroachments. BMC has yet to take any action for razing illegal constructions in the area. There are various court orders against these constructions.
