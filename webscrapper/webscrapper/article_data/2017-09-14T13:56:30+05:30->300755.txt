BHOPAL: Two   from Agra who were alleged to be playing ‘Blue Whale’ and were allegedly tasked in the second stage to run away from their homes were rescued by police at   railway station late on Tuesday.

 The girls were counselled by the counsellors of the women empowerment department and handed over to their parents on Wednesday evening. 
 
 “We received information that two girls aged around 15, were sitting alone in the waiting room of the railway station at around 9.30 pm in the night. I went to the waiting room and was found that both the girls were very scared. They were students of Class 9, one a daughter of an ex-serviceman while the other daughter of a local businessman in Agra,” Hoshangbad GRP police outpost in-charge,   told TOI. 
 
 He added, “They informed me that they were playing a game called Blue Whale. In the first stage they were asked to break tube lights, which they did so and in the second stage where they were tasked to run away from their homes. They were threatened that their parents would be killed if they failed to complete the task.”
 
 Officials of the shelter home were informed because there are no lady constables at the police outpost. The girls were provided with snacks and food and were then sent to the shelter home and the district administration and the parents of girls were informed,” he said.
