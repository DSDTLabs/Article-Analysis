COIMBATORE: An elderly couple has been arrested for forging land documents and selling the property of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s relative. The duo was arrested last July for taking a loan of Rs 1.20 crore from Karur Vysya Bank in   by forging documents of the same property. 

 The arrested were identified as K  , 68, and his wife R Savitha, 58, both natives of Ammapet in Salem district. Rajamanickam, police said, was an ex-serviceman.
 
 According to the police, businessman N Arun, of   in Salem, who is a relative of Palaniswami, a few months ago lodged a complaint with the district registrar, saying his mother Thilagam had got power of attorney for a 4,840sqft property located near   at RS Puram from Savitha in 1997 for Rs 35 lakh and sold 528sqft land to two persons in October 1997. 
 
 “Later, she leased the remaining 4,312sqft land to Jayakumar for 99 years. However, Savitha cancelled the power of attorney in April 1999, and forged land documents and sold 2200sqft to a person named T Moorthy in 2003. Later, many land deals were made in 2004 and 2005 by forging documents. Savitha also pledged forged land documents to take a bank loan of Rs 1.20 crore in 2013. Arun requested the district registrar to take appropriate action,” the police said. 
 
 Periyasamy, joint registrar, Coimbatore, conducted inquiry with Savitha and Rajamanickam and came to know that they had forged the documents and sold the property to a few people. Based on his complaint, city crime branch police registered a case against the couple under Sections 120 B, 468, 471 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code and arrested them on Thursday. They were later remanded in judicial custody.
