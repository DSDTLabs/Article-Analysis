Panaji: Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte protested the lack of action by Goa chief electoral office following complaints regarding phone calls threatening the electorate to vote for BJP, failing which their names would be deleted from social welfare schemes. In his complaint, Khaunte stated that the BJP is influencing voters by saying their names were added to government schemes like Griha Aadhar and Laadli Laxmi through the local BJP office and will be removed if they donâ€™t vote for their candidate Guruprasad Pawaskar. Khaunte called this a flagrant misuse of government machinery for political intimidation. tnn
