MEERUT: As you cross Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College and enter the rural outskirts of Meerut, anyone at any chai stall will be able to direct you to the house of Dr   in Dattawali village. At 91 years of age, Aazad is among the oldest candidates for the   and one of the oldest ever in the country. He is all set to file his nomination papers on Monday. Ram Sundar Das contested from Patna in the 2014   elections, also at the age of 91.

 "I will contest from Meerut South constituency this time around. My supporters will be paying the amount of the deposit," Aazad, a doctor by profession, claimed proudly, a thick shawl draped loosely over his wiry frame to protect his body from the winter chill.
 
 His family members were apparently unaware that Aazad was going to contest this time as well, but he was unfazed. "I have contested 11 times before, this is not new for me," he said, bringing out nomination papers from a bag.
 
 The nonagenarian is indeed a veteran when it comes to the electoral arena, having contested eight times for the Lok Sabha, twice for the   and once to be the President of India. "Yes, I also wanted to be President. But I didnâ€™t win. See, service of the people is what I am in this for. That is all that matters to me," said Aazad.
