Actress   has opened up about her sexuality weeks after coming out during an episode of  , saying being   does not mean one is confused.
 
  
 
  
  Stewart, 26, who has dated both men and women, said she does not get it why bisexuals have always been labelled "confused" as the actress thinks it is, in fact, "quite the opposite", reported The Guardian.
  
  "I mean it's definitely still there. People still have some horrendous experiences. But it's cool that you don't have to nail everything down anymore. That whole certainty about whether you're straight or gay or whatever.
  
  "You're not confused if you're bisexual. It's not confusing at all. For me, it's quite the opposite," Stewart said.
  
  She added, "I don't want to seem presumptuous because everyone has their own experience. The whole issue of sexuality is so gray. I'm just trying to acknowledge that fluidity, that grayness, which has always existed. But maybe only now are we allowed to start talking about it.
