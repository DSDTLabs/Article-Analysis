Singer   made her debut as a playback singer with the soothing Alunguren Kulunguren from   and then followed it up with the melodious Pazhaya Soru from Thirunaal. Having struck a chord with the listeners, the singer says that everything happened by chance. 

 'Though I was enrolled in music classes when I was three or four years old, I started taking music lessons seriously only after Class Seven. I took up both Hindustani and western classical music. I was even part of two music reality shows '   and Super Singer. Music director   had come to our class one day. He was an ex-student of my master. He had come looking for singers and my music teacher suggested my name. It was pure luck that I was present that day at class. Otherwise, I wouldn't have got an opportunity to sing,' says Namitha. 
 
 Namitha, who idolises   Ghoshal, adds, 'I went and sang the track, but little did I know that they will use my voice. After hearing Alunguren... Srikanth Deva sir had called me for Pazhaya Soru. Both the music directors were very sweet. They explained patiently and allowed me to explore a bit.' The second- year commerce student is also singing for Ghibran next. 'My aim is to become someone like Shreya,' she says.
