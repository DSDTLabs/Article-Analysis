The   began on a rather sour note for celebrity anchor   who was booked for driving his car in an inebriated state, in the early hours of Monday. At around 3 am,   was returning from a New Year revelry when his car was intercepted by cops on Road No 45, Banjara Hills who made him take a breath analyser test. Much to the shock of the cops, the machine gave a reading of 178 points. Regulations stipulate that cops can seize a vehicle on a reading of 35. “A case was immediately booked against Pradeep and his vehicle promptly seized. The star anchor then left in another vehicle,” informs an eyewitness. 
Video clips of Pradeep’s run in with the cops began to trend on social media all day on Tuesday along with speculation that he could be jailed. When contacted, the   officals at   room said, “Since this is the first time Pradeep has been booked for drunk driving he will be let off after undergoing a counselling session and paying a fine. He might be needed to appear before the court if summoned.”
