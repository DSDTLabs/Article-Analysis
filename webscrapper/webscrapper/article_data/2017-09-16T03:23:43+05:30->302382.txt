GREATER NOIDA: The   Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) on Friday met builders of 31 ongoing group housing projects in the city, to expedite completion of residences. According to   officials, five builders have promised to complete their projects in all respects and apply for completion certificates so that 2,500 homebuyers can be handed over possession of their flats within a week.

 Builders of another 25 projects have asked the GNIDA to give them 20 to 60 days so that they can provide a timeline for completion of projects. These projects will house another 14,500 residents. “Builders of these projects have asked us for different time frames for submitting their road maps for completion,” said a GNIDA official. “While some need 20 days others have asked for two months. We’ll review these projects again on October 10,” he added.
 
 The official further added that the five projects which will be complete within a week, include projects of builders Jyotirmay, Earthcon, Habitech, Nirala and Ajnara.
