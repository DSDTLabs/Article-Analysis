At the event,   conducted a special workshop for students on art appreciation as well as taught them some exciting techniques, color schemes and composition styles to enliven their canvas.
 
  
 The aim of inviting Maity and hosting a week-long art session was to highlight the importance of art in education as well as for child development. The medium helps develop various skills like fine motor skills, cognitive development, math and language skills etc amongst kids and allows them to channel their inner creativity! As part of the art week, students created interesting art pieces through artificial printing, calligraphy printmaking, symmetry printing, artist impression for legends like Monet, Akbar Padamsee, Picasso etc. Besides painting, the kids also sculpted various figurines and displayed them in the finale exhibition.
  
  
 Speaking at the event, Maity said, “I am excited to meet these talented bunch of students with a passion for art! The school has taken a great initiative in highlighting the importance of art at an early age. The medium allows for boundless expression through various colors, textures, canvas etc. I truly believe that art plays a major role in building a child’s personality, and that it should be given equal importance as other academic subjects in school. It is promising to notice the change in our education system that is recognizing art and its worth. I wish the students all the best and will advise them to keep the artist in them alive”
  
 The event concluded with an exhibition that displayed various art works created by students and was much appreciated by all!
