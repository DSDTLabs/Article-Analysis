We plan to provide transit accommodation to the residents in Worli itself,” said Executive Engineer SS Konnur.
 
 The BDD chawls were developed by the British in the 1920s as low-cost housing. There are 207 of these across 37 hectare in Worli, NM Joshi Marg, Naigaon and Sewri. More than 12,000 families reside in the 160-sq ft houses.
