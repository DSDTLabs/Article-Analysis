Mumbai: Vinod Moorjani (45), a US citizen of Indian origin, who was arrested on Sunday for allegedly making “bomb threat” call at Mumbai’s International Airport can fly back to Virginia only after the court allows the police to release his seized passport. 

 Moorjani, who is still in Mumbai, is expected to move an application before the magistrate’s court in Andheri to get his passport back. Experts said that looking at the sections slapped on Moorjani, he can get bail. Officials of the Sahar police station on Monday submitted a final probe report which states that Moorjani made the call to delay a Delhi-Rome flight as he thought he would not reach in time. Moorjani had reportedly told the woman attending his call: “Bomb hai in Delhi-Rome flight”. He, his wife and children were offloaded around 4.30pm from a Mumbai-Delhi flight after the woman lodged a complaint. 
 
 His lawyer told the court that his client was only checking the status of “BOM-DEL flight” and the woman who attended the call misunderstood. TOI tried to reach Moorjani, but he did not respond.
 
 Former IPS officer-turned-lawyer YP Singh said as per a SC ruling, an arrest has to made only after some investigation, if the matter is serious and requires custodial interrogation. “Arrests can also be done if there is a possibility of the accused absconding. In this case, there was no need to arrest and therefore, it becomes a fit case for grant of bail,” said Singh.
 
 A lawyer, who was at the Andheri court on Monday, said accountability has to be fixed for making arrests without conducting a proper investigation.
