PANAJI: Four phenomena were responsible for unexpected   on Tuesday, making the day look like any other day in June with many parts of the state experiencing a light drizzle for some time.

 The four-pronged effect was from the cyclonic circulation extending up to 1.5 km above mean sea level over   area, and the other effect was the formation of a low atmospheric pressure belt, originating in the Maldives to an area off the   coast.
 
 Two other episodes added to the overall impact, but did not find a mention in the bulletin of the India meteorological department (IMD). One was the anti-cyclonic circulation from   and the other, a mid-tropospheric trough in the westerly winds.
 
 “The confluence of all this caused a drizzle,” SD Sanap, scientist at IMD,   said.
 
 The minimum temperature rose from around 18C during the last few days to 21.8C, which is 1.4 degrees above normal on Wednesday morning. On Friday, the mercury had dropped to the lowest of the season so far to 17.6C.
