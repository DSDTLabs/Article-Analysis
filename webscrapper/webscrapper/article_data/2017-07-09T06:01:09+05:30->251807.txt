 (NORTH DINAJPUR): A fortnight after three cattle thieves were lynched at Chopra in  , one person was killed in clashes that broke out between Trinamool Congress and   supporters at Chandragunj locality of the town on Saturday. Both parties claimed they were attacked by the other. 

 According to the BJP district leadership, they were in the middle of an organizational meeting at Chandragunj Primary School in which several senior leaders, including district president Nirmal Dam and secretary Partha Majumdar, were present when they were attacked by Trinamool goons. 
 
 “At 5.30pm, a huge group of   activists armed with bombs and revolvers attacked us. We tried to resist but we were not armed and they started hurling bombs and firing at us indiscriminately,” BJP mandal president Sajan Ram Singh said.
 
 One person identified as Aren Singh, 35, a resident of Chandragunj, died on the spot after he took a bullet in the head. “Four other supporters were seriously injured and are undergoing treatment in different hospitals. This was an unprovoked attack,” Singh said.
 
 The district Trinamool leadership, however, denied the allegation. “We were having our booth-level meeting when they attacked us with guns and swords. I don’t know of any death but if anyone died it was because of them and not us,” said local MLA Hamidur Rahman. 
 
 “There was a clash and one person died. We have started investigation,” said additional SP of North Dinajpur Pradip Jadav. 
 
 According to the police, the clash is a result of the tension prevailing in the area since three cattle lifters were beaten to death on June 26. “The area has always been sensitive but now the situation has turned vulnerable and clashes can break out any time for any reason,” a senior police officer said.
