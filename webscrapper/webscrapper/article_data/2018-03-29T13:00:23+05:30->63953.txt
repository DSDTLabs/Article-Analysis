PATNA: Former   CM and RJD MLC   and deputy chief minister   (SuMo) locked horns in the legislative council on Wednesday over the alleged   in the state recently.

 Rabri accused the government of misleading the state assembly on Tuesday that no curfew was imposed in Aurangabad and there had been no communal clashes during Ram Navami. She said communal clashes took place at Rosera in Samastipur district and Bhagalpur town recently.
 
 But SuMo denied that curfew was imposed anywhere in the state and asked   to get herself the matter probed. BJP MLCs Nawal Kishore Yadav and Lal Babu Prasad also had heated arguments with Rabri and other RJD members on the issue.
 
 Later, while interacting with the media outside the council, Rabri lashed out at the government over the poor law and order and alleged that crime was on the rise after chief minister Nitish Kumar joined hands with the NDA in July last year.
 
 Earlier, when the house assembled to conduct the day’s business, RJD MLCs trooped into the well and raised anti-government slogans over alleged scam in the purchase of cobalt machines and other instruments at IGIMS in 1996-97 for treatment of cancer. RJD’s Sanjay Prasad, while moving an adjournment motion, said a vigilance probe in this regard had detected fraud and an FIR had been lodged against Dr Dileep Yadav and Dr Subhash Prasad. He said SuMo, who was the then leader of opposition, was also a member of the IGIMS governing body at that time. Sanjay alleged that SuMo as a member of the IGIMS governing body, had given his approval for the purchase of machines and the matter was suppressed after NDA came to power in the state.
