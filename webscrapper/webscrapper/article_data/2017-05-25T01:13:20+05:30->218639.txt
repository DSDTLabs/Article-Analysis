NEW DELHI: More than a fortnight after a 60-year-old jeweller was found murdered at his shop in Beadonpura near  , police arrested two men from Sonipat on Monday.

 The accused had robbed gold jewellery worth Rs 60 lakh from Ravinder Kapoor and smothered him with a cloth when he tried to resist their attempt. 
 
 Police said that the prime accused, Sanjay, was caught after an officer identified him from the CCTV footage.
 
 Kapoor owned several workshops and supplied jewellery to showrooms in Karol Bagh. On April 30, Sanjay and Sahil — along with two accomplices — entered Kapoor’s shop posing as customers from Punjab when his domestic help Bhagirath had gone to buy groceries. 
 
 The accused tried to snatch jewellery from Kapoor, but when he resisted their attempt, one of the men smothered him with a piece of cloth. As Kapoor fell unconscious, they tied his hands and feet. While fleeing they met Bhagirath and assaulted him as well.
 
 “A team led by special staff and officers from the nearby police station was formed to track down the men,” said Mandeep Singh Randhawa, DCP, central.
 
 Incidentally, one of the officers — sub-inspector Satender — had nabbed Sanjay in 2013. When Satender saw the CCTV footage, he identified Sanjay, though he was wearing a wig to change his appearance.
 
 Police then contacted Sanjay’s former associate in Amritsar who confirmed his role. Sanjay was arrested from a hideout in Sonipat. 
 
 Sanjay told officers that he met the other accused in Tihar Jail three years ago, when he was serving a sentence for cheating several jewellers in Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh.The accused allegedly sold the jewellery soon after the robbery. Efforts are on to arrest the two absconding men and recover the money.
