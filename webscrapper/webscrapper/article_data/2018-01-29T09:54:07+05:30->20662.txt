MADURAI: Members of Kanyakumari Christians   at Chennai, people from Kanyakumari district settled in Chennai, have urged Indian Railways to extend long running trains terminating at Chennai, Madurai and   till Kanyakumari so that it will benefit people across the state. 

 Their demands included extension of train number 12688/87 Chandigarh/Dehradun – Madurai Biweekly Express, 12652/51 Nizamuddin – Madurai   Sampark Kranti, 12663/64 Howrah – Trichy Biweekly till Kanyakumari and extension of 12224/12223 Madurai – Chennai Central Duronto till Thiruvananthapuram. They also urged extension of any one train plying between Chennai and Visakhapatnam weekly express to Kanyakumari via Madurai.
 
 The members reasoned that there are lots of people from Southern districts employed in Chennai as well as students studying in the educational institutions there, but the train services between Chennai and southern districts are not many and booking a train ticket to southern districts is difficult.
 
 At present, the Bilaspur – Tirunelveli (22620/19), Kanniyakumari – Dibrugarh (15905/06) and Nagercoil – Shalimar (12659/60) weekly trains are running through Nagercoil, Trivandrum, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Erode, Salem and   route. Due to this circuitous route (additional 210 km), it takes a long time, seven hours, extra to reach the destination. This route was followed to make the train beneficial for passengers of Kerala. But, it causes a lot of time and monetary loss for passengers from Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli District passengers, stated   secretary of the forum.
 
 It could be noted that   general manager,   addressing MPs from Trichy and Madurai division on Saturday stated that more trains could be possible once the doubling of Madurai – Kanyakumari tracks, of which construction inaugurated recently, is completed.
