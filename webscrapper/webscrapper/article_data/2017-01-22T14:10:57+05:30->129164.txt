GUWAHATI: Police are gearing up for more than the annual terror threats the state faces in the run-up to Republic Day this time. With three outfits issuing threats to Bengali- and Hindi-speaking people to leave Karbi Anglong, Tripura and parts of West Bengal by March 31, police have had to tighten their security measures even further. 

 A senior police officer said all pockets which have Hindi- and Bengali-speaking population in every district have been identified and put under strict vigil.
 
 "We have heightened police security in these pockets and one senior police officer in the rank of DSP has been put in charge of ensuring security in each of these pockets. We are taking the threat seriously," the officer said.
 
 The police are considering opening up easy and direct access of people to the SP in every district for faster flow of information directly to district heads.
 
 The   (KLO), the   (NLFT) and the newly floated People's Democratic Council of Karbi-Longri (PDCK) issued the 'quit Assam' threat on January 2 and again on January 18.
 
 They said they oppose the Centre's move to rehabilitate Bangladeshi migrants in "Kamatapur, Karbi Longri and Tripura" and have, in response, asked Indian citizens (Hindi- and Bengali-speaking) to leave these three areas by March 31.
 
 The quit notice was signed by KLO chairman  , NLFT organising secretary   and PDCK chairman JK Lijang.
 
 The three organizations are under the patronage of the NSCN (K) and Ulfa (I). The state has witnessed several bouts of bloody attacks on Hindi-speaking people, mostly labourers, in the past by Ulfa. In 2007, the outfit gunned down more than 70 labourers of Bihari origin working at brick kilns in upper Assam.
