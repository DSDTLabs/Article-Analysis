 Uttar Pradesh has the lead in approved budgetary sum with 26% followed by Bihar which had 13% share in the country . Infact, five states--Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal received 60% of the SSA approved allocations in financial year 201617, says a report prepared by Accountability Initiative, an advocacy group based in Delhi.
 
 However, the higher approved allocation neutralizes as state has third highest per student spending in the country . State spends Rs 9, 363 per child enrolled in elementary classes. Estimates say that state spent 92% of the budgetary allocation on meeting the salaries of teachers while very less amount is meant for infrastructure deve lopment. Uttar Pradesh is one rank above with spending Rs 11, 453 per child. The average per child spending is Rs 6, 350 in the country .
 
 “State has to rationalise the allocated budget on all components for the development of education sector. The proportion of amount being spent on teachers is the highest in the country leaving very less scope for teachers training and infrastructure development which is also very important component,“ said KB Kothari, an educationist.
 
 This year with the rise of 4% in the budgetary alloca tion of SSA, state is expecting a rise in the SSA allocations for itself.The total budget announced in the budget was Rs 23, 500 crore from Rs 22, 500. The GOI-state fund sharing ratio for SSA was revised in October 2015, to 60:40.
