Bengaluru’s infamous traffic jams literally halted   supremo   in her tracks, but the former   hit the road with gusto and walked for nearly half a kilometre to make it in time for H D Kumaraswamy’s swearing-in ceremony in front of Vidhana Soudha late Wednesday afternoon. The convoy of Mayawati, who was on her way to Vidhana Soudha from  , had to stop after it ran into a huge traffic jam at Chalukya Hotel, Basaveshwara Circle, said traffic police.

 As police and her security personnel were wondering what to do, Mayawati promptly hit the D Devaraj Urs Road and she briskly walked up till Vidhana Soudha.
 
 
 Mamata Banerjee too walked for a couple of hundred metres after her convoy had to stop on Devaraj Urs Road.
