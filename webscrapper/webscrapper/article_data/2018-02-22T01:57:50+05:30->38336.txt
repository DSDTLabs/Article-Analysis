GURUGRAM: Weeks after a four-month-old   was   after falling from a tree during a monkey catching exercise at  , a residential society on Gurugram-Faridabad road, MCG on Tuesday cancelled the contract of its animal rescue agency. 

 Following a complaint filed by animal activists, the civic body had carried out an investigation. “We cancelled the agency’s contract as the probe revealed that they were using illegal means to rescue animals. A new agency will be hired by the corporation soon after ensuring that all norms and laws are followed while rescuing animals,” said Y S Gupta, joint commissioner of MCG.
 
 Reportedly, the agency workers on February 3 administered drugs through bananas to a group of monkeys in Valley View Estate leading to the four-month-old monkey falling from a tree, leading to fracture in both the legs, and being attacked by a few stray dogs.
 
  from Umeed (an animal welfare NGO), who has been taking care of the injured monkey, said, “The monkey is still in a very critical condition. We have consulted many experts, but it seems one of monkey’s foot can’t be treated and might have to be amputated. Also, he is not in a condition to undergo a surgery now as he has become very week due to the impact of sedatives. 
 
 “Cancelling the contract is not an answer to the lifelong damage caused to the monkey. It is shocking that the police haven’t registered any FIR in the matter yet. We demand strict legal action against the agency,” he told TOI.
