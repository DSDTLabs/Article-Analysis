Chandigarh: Union home minister   participated as the chief guest in a programme of the BJP’s youth wing at the party’s local office, Kamlam, in Sector 33. Rajnath called on the youth to make India the “vishwa guru” (universal teacher) once again by drawing inspiration from its rich cultural heritage.

 Rajnath urged volunteers of the wing, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), to help their peers shun drugs and other evils. He said the world remembered the people for their values and their services to society, and not for their wealth or might.
 
  Chandigarh president Sanjay Tandon said it was a historic moment for the city BJP unit that Rajnath inaugurated Kamlam and it had now been equipped with latest technology. Later, while replying to questions of media on a housing scheme for UT employees, he said the MP and BJP president had discussed the issue with him and it was under consideration.
