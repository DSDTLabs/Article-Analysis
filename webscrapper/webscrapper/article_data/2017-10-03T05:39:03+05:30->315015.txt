In the introduction of `Vidyarthio ne   na Patro' (Gandhiji's letters to the students), Amrut  , secretary of Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust, mentions an incident where young Kanu Gandhi, Mahatma's grandson, questions him innocently why he keeps admonishing children about bad handwriting even when his (Mahatma's) are not that great.

 “Mahatma replies that he was aware of the fact and thus kept asking the toddlers to improve so that they don't have to regret about it while they grow up,“ said Modi. The book, compiled by Modi, was launched at Sabarmati Ashram on Monday on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. Talking about the motive behind writing the book, Modi said that a different facet of Mahatma's personality can be seen while going through the letters.The book has excerpts from 472 letters.
