LUCKNOW: Vice-president   on Saturday said that Ram Rajya too was all about ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, the slogan coined by   during 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

 
 Naidu, who launched a book, ‘Ankaha Lucknow’ written by senior BJP leader and former Lucknow MP Lalji  , said that the objective cannot be achieved without removing discrimination along caste and religion lines.
 
 “Still there many people are living below poverty line and are not educated. Until they are brought on a par with other people, Ram Rajya cannot be achieved,” he said. “Hindutva never supported any discrimination. It crept in later,” said Naidu in the presence of CM Yogi Adityanath and Governor Ram Naik.
 
 Naidu said that raising ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ slogan should not create any controversy.
 
 “Religion should not come in the way of ‘Bhartiyata’,” he said.
 
 The V-P also hailed Tandon’s book as an encyclopedia that told untold stories about Lucknow and its culture and is a treasure of information.
 
 Earlier in the day, Naidu inaugurated the new office of   (UPERC). Certified by   (BEE), Vidyut Niyamak Bhawan is the state’s first ECBC (Energy Conservation Building Code) compliant building.
