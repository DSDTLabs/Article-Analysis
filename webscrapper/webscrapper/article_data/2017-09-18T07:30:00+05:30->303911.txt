Panchkula: Around 60 members of Citizen Welfare Association (CWA) and Nagar Sudhar Sabha Panchkula on Sunday protested against the state government in sector 15 market against water tariff hike. 

 The residents informed TOI that the state government in the past couple of months has raised the water prices nearly by three-four times.
 
 Protestors further informed that the government should roll back the hike in the water rates immediately. Protestors also informed that on the one hand, they are getting poor supply of water and on the other hand, the government is increasing the price every day. 
 
 “This is nothing but harassment for a large number of consumers here,” said one of the residents. President CWA SK Nayar said, “We are not getting water supply on the first floor of our houses due to low pressure. Such poor facility is not expected from the officials.”
 
 Protestors also carried written slogans such as ‘Modi sarkar hay hay’, ‘Paani ki badhi kimatein wapas lo’ and ‘BJP murdabad’.
 
 A delegation of the protestors will also meet the administrator of Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) on Monday and will submit the memorandum asking them to roll back the hike in water tariff.
