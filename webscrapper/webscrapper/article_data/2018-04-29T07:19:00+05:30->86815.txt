Ludhiana: The death toll in LPG cylinder blast case mounted to four as one more injured, identified as Ram Naresh, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday. He was the sole bread earner of the family and is survived by wife and three children.

 Ram Naresh, 42, currently residing in Samrat Colony, Giaspura, originally belonged to Raibareli in Uttar Pradesh. His house was near the residence of Ashok Yadav where LPG cylinder exploded on Thursday.
 
 On the day when the cylinder exploded, 40-year-old Sunita and her son were killed and 32 others were seriously injured.
 
 On Friday, another resident — 35-year-old Shashi— succumbed to her injuries.
 
 Ram Naresh like many others had gone to the spot just to see what had happened there. He was admitted to ESI hospital from where he was taken to Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital (GTB) in the evening on Friday. He breathed his last at 1.35am on Saturday.
 
 He was a worker in Oswal factory. The family is yet to cremate the body as his mother and some other relatives are coming from Raibareli. The body has been kept in the civil hospital.
 
 Meanwhile, condition of some other patients admitted to Christian Medical College and Hospital is also critical as doctors claimed the patients have received burns in their respiratory system which is a major cause of concern. The doctors said in such cases, the patients generally inhale flames which burn their respiratory system.
 
 There is no way to check inside the respiratory system to see the percentage of burns therefore they have no other option but to wait and watch the condition of the patients. The doctors at CMC said they have 12 patients at the moment and their condition is still critical.
