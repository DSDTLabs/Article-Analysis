Tuticorin: Farmers and livestock keepers in Thonugal, near Kovilapatty, of Tuticorin district, woke up to a frightful morning on Sunday after some mysterious wild animals invaded their area, killing nearly a dozen of sheep and injuring three others critically.

 M Gurusamy, of Thonugal, who lost 10 of his 65-strong flock in the midnight attack, said he had locked up all his cattle in the pen on Saturday evening, but were shocked to see some of them dead in the next morning. “Every day, after grazing them, I take my sheep to the pen set up on a farm about three kilometers from his house. I lock them up in the pen divided by three sheds. It was painful to see 10 of them gone,” he said.
 
 Gurusamy, who saw three more sheep lucky to survive the attack but battling for life, called in veterinarian from Villiseri to revive them. Treating the injured sheep, the vet identified the wounds as being inflicted by some wild animals. 
 
 “Veterinarian Shelvi said that my sheep were attacked by wild animals which could on the prowl in the area. She said the wounds did not look like those caused by dogs. It could be a pack of at least three or four wild animals,” Gurusamy said.
 
 The carcasses were taken to the veterinary hospital at Villiseri for autopsy. Farmers deeply upset over the incident lamented that the loss of the sheep could amount to Rs 2 lakh.
