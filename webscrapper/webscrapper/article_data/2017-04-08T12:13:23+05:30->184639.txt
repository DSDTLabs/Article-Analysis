Singer   says she was very shy as a kid. 

 The former Fifth Harmony member says despite her terrible nerves she managed to gather the courage to audition for 'The X Factor USA' but her parents were not sure if she would be able to go through with it because she was so crippled with anxiety.
 
 "I was very introverted as a kid. But I started bringing my CDs to the   after school; I'd ask for the boom box and go play my music in the corner and people would come over. And I created a little   channel doing covers - I must have posted 50. 
 
  
  
 
 "Even though I'd be like, 'Oh my God, this is so bad,' music was the thing I was passionate enough about to get over being shy. After seeing a 'One Direction' 'tips on auditioning for The X Factor (USA)' video, I asked Mom if I could audition," Cabello said. 
 
 The 20-year-old singer's mother Sinuhe praised her daughter for always "confronting her fears". 
 
 "I have never met someone who can confront her fears in the way she does. I can tell she's terrified, but she doesn't stop. She always asks me, 'Do you think everybody knows (I'm scared)?' And I'm like, 'No, nobody can tell.'"
