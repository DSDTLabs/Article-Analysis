RAJKOT: Women, physically challenged and the visually impaired will get concession for travelling in the Bus Rapid Transit System ( ) and   (RMTS) buses every Sunday. 

 Last month, the   (RMC) had announced 50 percent concession for woman travellers and free ride for all physically challenged persons and visually impaired persons in these buses every Sunday.   officials said that they have received positive response from the travellers.
 
 On an average, 7,100 women and 190 physically challenged people take benefit of the scheme every Sunday. 
 
 “We observed that nearly 40% of the BRTS and city bus users from Monday to Saturday are students. So, the number of passengers drastically declines on Sunday and buses run empty. So, it was decided to provide concession to women and divyangs on Sunday. It will help families coming from middle and lower-middle class to go around places on Sunday and we also get passengers,’’ said an official.
