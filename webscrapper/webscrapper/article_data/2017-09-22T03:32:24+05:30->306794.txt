NEW DELHI: The   has issued a public notice to cancel 45  , which were found fake. In a public notice, the north civic body has appealed to the authorities not to accept these certificates for any reason.

 The north corporation acted upon a complaint to inquire the issuance of birth certificates. “It has come to notice that some birth certificates were issued illegally. All such certificates have been annulled,” said a senior official.
 
 He further said, “The certificates cancelled by the department were issued during 1978-2011. We have issued the serial numbers in the public notice for the same.”
 
 Last year, about 20,000 blank pre-printed birth/death certificates were stolen from the office of North Corporation. In 2015, East Delhi Municipal Corporation too had reported a similar incident, when its website was hacked and 76 birth/death certificates were issued.
 
 Birth and death certificates are used to obtain passports, admission in school, colleges, to avail government schemes etc.
 
 However, senior officials from north civic body said that the department is now issuing birth/death certificates online and people need not go to any zonal offices for the same.
 
 “From this year onwards, we have changed the system. We are issuing birth/death certificates online and people only have to submit the required documents and details online and can take print out from anywhere. This has been done to ensure no fake certificates are being issued and if there is any discrepancy it can be tracked down,” he said.
