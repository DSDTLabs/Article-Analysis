LUCKNOW: In a recent survey conducted by the  , a   was reported in the Gonda, Agra and Aligarh. According to the survey, an average of only 15 Egyptian   could be sighted, though last year more than 50 were found in the respective places.

 “Every year, a survey is conducted on the population of the Egyptian vulture—the most common vulture species found in India out of the total nine species. The team has earlier reported that closure of bone mills and slaughter houses have led to a fall in number,” said Amita Kanuajia, who has been conducting research on vulture population from last 10 years.
 
 She said further closure of slaughter houses will make it tough for the threatened species that feeds on carcasses and otherwise survive on butcher scrap. Opening of a vulture   by scattering dead meat in a spot can help conserve the species. 
 
 “For last three years, I have been visiting Gonda to sight Egyptian vulture but this year I could spot only 15, while at the same place we had spotted 50 last year,” said research scholar Shivangi Mishra, adding that Egyptian vulture plays a very important role in the ecosystem, acting as natural incinerators that clear up carcasses down to even bones and thereby preventing diseases.
 
 She said following increase in closure of a slaughter house in Gonda, the number of Egyptian vultures reduced and added that closure of slaughter houses this year will lead to further decline.
 
 “In Agra, people said a number of slaughter houses had been closed this year hence Egyptian vultures have gone down in number,” said Mishra.
 
 In Aligarh, only 20 were sighted. The decline in vulture populations in some parts of the world, including India, may have serious consequences for ecosystems and humans so there is a need to open vulture restaurants like the one in Lalitpur to save the scavenging bird, she said.
