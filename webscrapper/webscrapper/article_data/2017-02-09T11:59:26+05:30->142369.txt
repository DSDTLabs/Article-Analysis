GORAKHPUR: In a major headache for BJP ahead of the first phase of polling on February 11, two Hindu outfits ­Hindu Yuva Vahini and Shiv Sena­on Wednesday announced to together field candidates on 150 seats in east UP to “teach a lesson to BJP“. HYV candidates will contest on   symbol.

 To further complicate the matter for BJP, even   is said to have joined the alliance though no formal comment was available from the outfit. While HYV had already declared 24 candidates from East UP, Maha sabha has announced two candidates so far. Shiv Sena candidates will contest on rest of the seats.
 
 That the alliance will contest on Ram temple issue, is quite clear. “Shiv Sena, HYV and even Hindu Mahasabha believe in Hindutva and this is the reason why we have come together to contest 150 seats in Assembly polls,“ said state president of Shiv Sena Thakur Anil Singh on Wednesday while talking to TOI on phone.
 
 “If we come to power, we'll construct Ram temple in six months. Shiv Sena chief   will install the first brick of the temple“, he said.
