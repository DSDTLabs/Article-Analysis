AHMEDABAD: Thousands gathered on the streets of the city as Shia Muslims marked Yavme Ashura, the tenth day of the month of Muharram. They took out a tazia procession mourning the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Husain and 72 others in the battle of Karbala in the seventh century.

Around 24 akhadas, 78 dhols and cymbals, 14 alam nishan groups, 10 maatami dasta (mourners’ groups), 24 trucks and 7 camel carts were part of the procession. They gathered near   from two primary routes — Astoda Darwaja and Ellisbridge — and concluded the procession on Sabarmati riverfront near Khanpur Darwaja,” he said.
 
 Parvez Momin further said that the Tazia procession is part of the city’s living history and a symbol of communal harmony as prizes for the best decorated Tazia are given by the Mahant of   for many years.
