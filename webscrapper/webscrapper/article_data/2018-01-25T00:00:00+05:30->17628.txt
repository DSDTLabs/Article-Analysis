That   was doing the Tamil and Telugu remake of the Kannada hit U-Turn was confirmed almost a year ago. However, the project didn’t take off as the actress got held up with other projects. But just very recently, Samantha took to Twitter to confirm that they would begin shooting for the remake in February, and that Pawan Kumar, who had directed the original, will be directing both the remakes. Giving us more details, Pawan says, “Both Samantha and I had other film commitments. So, we couldn’t start the project earlier. But now, things have fallen in place and we will begin shooting in February. We were supposed to start on February 10, but Samantha has injured her hand in another shoot. So, we will now begin shooting by the end of February. The shoot is most likely to go for about two-three months.” 

 Pawan also says that actors   and   Ravindran have been roped in for the remakes. “Aadhi will be essaying the cop’s role and Rahul will play Samantha’s boyfriend in the film. We are talking to a few more actresses for another role. We will confirm the same in a few days’ time,” he informs. Most of the film will be shot in Chennai and Hyderabad. Since the original was based on a particular flyover in Bengaluru, has Pawan zeroed in on the flyovers for Tamil and Telugu versions? “The flyover we have chosen for each remake is on the outskirts of the respective cities we are shooting in,” he informs.
