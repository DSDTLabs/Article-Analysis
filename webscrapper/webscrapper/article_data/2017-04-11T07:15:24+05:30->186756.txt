HYDERABAD: The committee set up by the government to examine and propose rules for   regulation will submit its final report to the Telangana government on April 20. This was announced after the committee's fourth and final meeting held on Monday.

 During the meeting, members discussed every clause of the draft GO and recorded their opinions.
 
 Representatives of Telangana Recognised Schools' Management Association (TRSMA) and   ( ) were asked to submit their written recommendations by April 17 so that the committee can submit the report on time and subsequently help formulate rules for setting up   (DFRCs).
 
 “After the submission of the committee report, the ball will be back in the government's court and its true intent will be put to test. If the government truly seeks a solution to this problem, it will immediately notify a new GO, which will be subsequently converted into an act,“ said Ashish Naredi, executive committee member of HSPA, who is representing parents on the committee. According to HSPA, while it insisted that the 5% limit on profitability should not be relaxed, schools demanded that the limit be enhanced to 15%.
 
 “I challenged a member of the school association to make the balance sheet of his school public and said that we would withdraw the agitation if the profit in his school was found to be anywhere close to 5%. The school representative obviously backed out,“ said Naredi, adding that the chairperson of the committee might conduct one last meeting after submitting written recommendations.
 
 HSPA has also requested the chairperson of the committee to include a charter of parents and students rights in the GO to assure parents that complaining against a school will not invite any action.
