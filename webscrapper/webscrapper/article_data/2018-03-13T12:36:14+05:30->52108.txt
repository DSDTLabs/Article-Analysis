VIJAYAWADA: TDP supremo, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu   on Monday lashed out at BJP government through his   account. In his most severe remarks since the ties between both TDP and BJP have worsened, he reminded finance minister Arun   that statehood for Telangana was granted as it was the sentiment of people, indirectly hinting that AP’s sentiments also should be respected. Naidu was responding to Jaitley’s comments that funds, support from centre and special status cannot be possible based on the political sentiments in the state. 

 Last week Jaitley categorically declined special status category to state, immediately after which TDP ministers in the Union cabinet resigned. Naidu in his two tweets said: “We will work day and night to rebuild the state, I have the experience, people of this state are hard working, but BJP is failing to provide justcie to the state.” 
 
 Naidu taking indirect dig at Jaitley’s comments said “the minister said that sentiment cannot fetch money. But he should be reminded that Telangana state was granted as it was the people’s sentiments .”
 
 Making it obvious that TDP ministers were pulled off after the minister’s remarks Naidu in his assembly speech earlier during the days said that it was unfortunate that state is getting raw deal and that they had to withdraw after his comments. However Naidu earlier said that TDP will wait and watch on the alliance with BJP on the other promised made in Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act (2014)
