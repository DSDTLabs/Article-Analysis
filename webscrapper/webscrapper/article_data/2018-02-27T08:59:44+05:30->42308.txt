GUWAHATI: After nine Assam   ( ) students were arrested on last Wednesday on charges of hooliganism and vandalism at a wedding party at  , the college authority and students have insisted on the need for taking steps to enclose the campus boundaries and install better security mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized entry of outsiders into the premises. 

 A recent meeting of the Engineering College Teachers Association of AEC,   Students Union and   with the AEC principal unanimously agreed to put into effect an effective security system on campus. 
 
 "The campus is porous and there are several entry and exit points making it difficult for the security guards to monitor and regulate unauthorized movement. The college premises will be enclosed and gated with appropriate security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized entry in the future," said a joint statement issued by the teachers, students and alumni of the college.
