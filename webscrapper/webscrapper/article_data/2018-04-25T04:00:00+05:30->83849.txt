Rajkot: A 21-year-old   immolated herself along with her one-year-old daughter following harassment allegedly by her husband and sister-in-law in Mandvi town of Kutch late night on Monday. Both, mother Parvati and daughter Trupti died on the spot.

 The father-in-law and mother-in-law of Parvati sustained burn injuries when they tried to save Parvati and the toddler. The duo — Bhanji Maheshwari (58) and his wife Lalbai (55) have been admitted to government hospital in Bhuj for treatment.
 
 Police booked Parvati’s husband Rajesh (25) and sister-in-law Savita (21) for harassment and abetting her suicide. They were booked based on a complaint filed by Parvati’s father Peraj Maheshwari (45), a resident of Kervand in Abdasa taluka of Kutch district.
 
 According to case details, Parvati had married Rajesh about two years ago. Ever since she came to live with her in-laws, Savita had been asking Parvati to let her wear her jewellery. However, Parvati had refused to let Savita use her jewellery. Police said that Savita and Rajesh had been taunting and harassing Parvati over the issue since last one year. On two or three occasions she had returned to her parents’ house but was sent back. 
 
 Parvati had returned from her parents’ house just three days ago as Savita was to get married later this month. On Monday night, Savita once again asked for the jewellery that led to heated argument that led to Parvati taking the extreme step.
