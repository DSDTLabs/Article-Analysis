PATNA: With the   of five drug peddlers by SP Nishant Tiwary conducting raids in mufti, the   police recently busted a gang of   traders.

 The arrested drug peddlers were forwarded to jail on Wednesday after interrogation.
 
 The SP told TOI over the phone on Thursday few people met him at his office on Tuesday and complained about the sale of ganja at   roundabout in the town despite prohibition in the state.
 
 “I asked them to help me identify the drug peddlers. After initial hesitation, one of them sat on the pillion as I rode a mobike to the spot,” Tiwary said and added he took care not to don khaki uniform which could have scared away the outlaws.
 
 Once the complainant identified the ganja seller, a differently-abled man on a tricycle, the SP alone went to him. “I told him I needed ganja for a party with my friends at home,” the SP recalled and added the man, however, had only two pouches of ganja for which he took Rs 200.
 
 He told the SP his bosses could provide him more ganja. As directed by him, the SP on the bike reached behind the Purnia bus stand and contacted two other peddlers.
 
 They had hidden the contraband in a garage. They charged the SP Rs 4,000 for 30 pouches.
 
 Before proceeding further, the SP directed the police station concerned to send a police team and arrest the three men. The SP then reached a cement shop located at a secluded place at Maranga, from where two men, said to be the gang leaders, were nabbed.
 
 “Altogether 3kg ganja was recovered during the three raids,” the SP said and added the police administration in collaboration with the district administration would soon launch an awareness drive in the schools and colleges against drug abuse. 
 
 He hoped his move would serve as a confidence-building measure and more people would tip off police about drug smuggling and abuse.
