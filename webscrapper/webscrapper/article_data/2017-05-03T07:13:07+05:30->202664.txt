PANAJI: The newly formed governing council of the Goa headmasters’ association has said that it will work towards getting enough funds for schools to run their own   buses.

 Vithoba Dessai, who has been elected as president of the association of aided high school heads, said that better maintenance grants for schools and improvement of infrastructure would also be the association’s priorities. Dessai appealed to school heads to unite and resolve issues concerning schools, students, teaching and non-teaching staff together.
 
 The association also elected the governing council that will work under Dessai. For the past 60 years, the association has been negotiating with state authorities to safeguard interests of educational institutions as well as students and teachers. It also conducts preparatory examinations for SSC students prior to the state board examination.
