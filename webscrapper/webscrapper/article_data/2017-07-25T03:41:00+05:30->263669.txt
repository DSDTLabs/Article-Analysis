Calangute: The Calangute panchayat has decided to crack down on the numerous illegal biryani outlets in the coastal tourism hub. With thousands of domestic tourists pouring every day into Calangute- probably the most popular beach destination in the country, biryani has turned out to be the food of choice for many. Looking at the number of biryani selling outlets mushrooming in Calangute, a visitor would think it's the biryani capital of the world. Available in chicken, mutton, beef, egg, fish, veg, etc, varieties, a biryani serving makes for a complete meal, say the vendors.  The biryanis served are also quite reasonable, say foodies, with some outlets even serving “terrific” biryani. But, there is a flip side: almost all these biryani outlets are illegal. “Anybody with a small shop puts up a table with a big vessel (handi) of biryani and puts up a board outside - ‘biryani’ and he’s into business,” alarmed panchayat members said at a recent gram sabha. Most of these outlets parcel away the biryani which tourists consume on the beach or in their vehicles, as most of these outlets do not have any sitting arrangements. So everybody from grocery and clothes stores, stationery shops, electricity appliances shops, bars, even barber shops, now have a corner of their shop selling biryani, the most popular being chicken biryani which mostly sells for Rs 100. Mutton costs Rs 150.  “Any place selling food has to have a restaurant license from the panchayat, but none of these biryani outlets have a restaurant license,” a panchayat member said.
