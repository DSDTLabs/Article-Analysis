BENGALURU: The government on Monday submitted a memo before the high court stating that they would stick to the earlier order where 50% seats in various state-run rural residential schools are reserved for students from the general merit category. 

 The court was told that by way of a February 28, 2018 circular, the old system of providing 50% of admission to students from the general merit category, and 25% each to SC/STs and OBCs students has been revived. The rural residential schools include   and Kittur Rani Chennamma schools.
 
 Justice A S Bopanna disposed of a petition filed by Vishwanath S Mathad and others, challenging a July 24, 2017 notification, reserving 75% of the seats in the schools to students from scheduled castes, 10% to those from scheduled tribes and 15% to those from backward classes. The court had earlier stayed the notification and also the entrance exam for schools.
 
 
 
 
  The high court on Monday granted time to H N Sathayanarayana, retired director general of police (DGP) of the prisons department, to amend his petition to include a challenge against the FIR registered by the   ( ). 
 
 Justice Raghvendra S Chauhan made this suggestion while noting that an FIR has been registered against Rao.
 
 Additional advocate general ( ) A S Ponnanna raised objection with regard to making the chief minister a respondent in the petition.
 
 Rao's counsel Puttige R Ramesh said as the chief minister has given consent to the registration of the FIR as the competent authority, he has been made party in the petition. Rao has challenged the February 26, 2018 government order, asking the ACB to register a case against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The order cited that Rao has been accused of receiving Rs 2 crore bribe to extend undue favours to AIAMDK leader   at Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara.
 
 Rao has claimed that DIG D Roopa, who made bribery allegations against him, did not provide any evidence.
