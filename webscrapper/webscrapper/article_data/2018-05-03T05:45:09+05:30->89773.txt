 Immediately after the murder the then Mumbai police commissioner, Arup Patnaik, had formed several teams. "We scanned the data of all public phone booths, from near his mother's house in Ghatkopar to  , where he lived. This helped us get details of a call one accused made to another on following Dey," said Sripad Kale, now senior inspector of Mulund police station. 
 
 Retired police inspector  , who was leading the crime branch team then, said, "The conviction has endorsed our probe. Proving any criminal conspiracy is nearly impossible in such cases, but we were able to establish the role of the entire gang." When asked about the acquittal of journalist  , inspector Nandkumar Gopale said, "We produced whatever evidence we had found. We don't know the grounds on which she has been acquitted.
