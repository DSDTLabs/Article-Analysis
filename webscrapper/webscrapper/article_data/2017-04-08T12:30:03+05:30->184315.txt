SURAT: The   has played cupid for a 25-year-old girl born in the United States to   and a 25-year-old farmer of   Chikli in   

 Jessica Camacho Bustos, who works in a bank in Georgia in the United States, became friends with Akash Patel, who is a Class XII pass, thanks to Facebook in August 2016. She came to India 10 days ago to meet Akash and got married to him on Thursday evening which to many is just like a fairy tale. The couple got married in the village and are on their way to Manali for honeymoon via Mumbai. They will remarry again in the US for the satisfaction of Jessica’s parents.
 
 Akash took tuitions of English to converse with Jessica, who came to see India but fell head over heels in love with an Indian. “He is so family-oriented and caring. I felt I would be happy with him. So, I decided to marry him,” said Jessica, who landed in Mumbai in the last week of March. 
 
 Her parents initially were reluctant when she told them about her intention to get married to Akash. They asked her to just get engaged to him for now but Jessica’s second phone call to the US convinced them that she was determined. 
 
 Akash owns a   in 12 bigha of land and also cultivates sugarcane in Sahedpur. He is well off and has just his mother to look after. He says, “Trust is the main thing. My mother has accepted Jessica as her daughter-in-law. She found her to be a sweet girl. There is no language barrier between us.” 
 
 “Jessica would be returning to the US on April 14. She will come again in December. At present, I am showing her different parts of India,” Akash said. Jessica told TOI, “I don’t know what future holds for us. Either he will come to the US or I may choose to settle in India. We just want to live together.”
