 With an intention to improve the passing percentage and ranking of II PU, the Department of Pre-University, Mysuru district, conducted special classes for those who performed below average during the II PU midterm exam. Last year, there was an improvement in the passing percentage as the district stood 11th in the state with a pass percentage of 65.53 per cent. Hence, to improve the passing percentage and ranking in the state, various programmes have been conducted. More number of students are appearing from government colleges; among 34,753 students, 16,177 students will appear from government colleges while 9,910 students are from unaided institutions and 8,666 students are from aided colleges. 
 
 Speaking to TOI. Jayaprakash, DDPU, Mysuru district, said “A total of 34,753 students from nearly 220 different colleges will appear for the exam at 50 different centres spread across the district. Last year, across the state, the performance in economics and performance among SC/ST students had come down across the state. Hence, keeping this in mind, the government had chalked out various special classes. During the Dasara vacation, we had also conducted special classes for SC/ST students. With all these preparations, we are expecting to be among the top 8 in the state.”
