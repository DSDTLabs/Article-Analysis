KOLKATA: The demonetisation effect is here to stay. At least till Durga Puja.

 Don’t lose heart if you thought the worst was over. You don’t have to stand in bank queues for hours any more. The decision to recall notes have been picked up by a central Kolkata puja committee as their theme. Right from the pandal to the idols and the ambience around, everything will speak aloud about the way life has changed post November 8.
 
 The theme of the  , christened ‘M-Factor’, has just been finalized by artist Ashish Basak. Talks are on with government art college students, who will bring it to life with the help of local decorators. 
 
 The pandal will be in the shape of a massive ATM machine that will have three sides. While one side will be a broken down machine, showing that an irate mob had attacked it, the other side will show how it is being recalibrated to fit in new notes. The third side will show a brand new machine dispensing new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes. 
 
 This is not all. Leave alone 10 hands, Durga will have no hands at all. “This is representative of her despair and helplessness at the all-round distress and economic downslide post de-monetisation,” Basak explained. 
 
 The lane leading to the pandal will be strewn with scenes related to de-monetisation — people standing in long queues outside banks and ATMs, opposition parties taking to ‘dharnas’, the 100-odd reported deaths and the overall slump in the markets. “We are not doing this to win awards but to spread awareness about how this irresponsible decision by Modi has affected the entire country adversely,” said Partho Bose, former councillor of ward 40 and the present TMC ward president.
