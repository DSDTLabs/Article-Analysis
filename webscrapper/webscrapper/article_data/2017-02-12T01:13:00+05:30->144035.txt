Allahabad: The UP assembly elections would help students of at least 45,809 government primary and upper primary schools of the state study in electrified schools. The basic education department has released a fund of Rs 28.13 crore for lighting all such schools, where either there is no electrification or cables in existing ones are lying defunct. 

 All the selected schools, falling under the first phase of elections, have already been lit up while work is going on in the government schools, which come under remaining phases.

District magistrate of each district has been entrusted with the task of completing the work under their supervision while Basic Shiksha Adhikaris have been made in-charge of the work. 
 
 Director education (basic) Dinesh Babu Sharma said, “At least Rs 6,142 per school has been allocated for wiring or electrifying the school, and in case any discrepancy is detected at the level of bungling of funds or use of poor quality of equipment, action will taken against the BSA concerned.” 
 
 Principal of a government primary school in Koraon, Rambali Yadav, said, “Currently, there are over 1.5 lakh primary and upper primary schools in the state. Official figure shows that over 70% of them are electrified while ground reality is that uninterrupted power supply is only in 50% of the schools of the state.”
