MUMBAI: The   (ED) on Thursday took possession of controversial businessman Vijay Mallya’s   at  , along with   cars parked inside. 

 Last year in Septmeber the agency had provisionally attached the farmhouse, worth Rs 300 crore and spread over 17 acres, in a money laundering case against Mallya. In February 2017, the adjudication authority had confirmed the attachment. The ED is probing two money laundering cases against Mallya. The first case pertains to an alleged default on a Rs 900-crore loan taken from IDBI Bank while the second is linked to a Rs 9,400-crore default on a loan from a consortium of 17 banks led by SBI. The ED suspects Mallya used the funds to procure properties in India and abroad.
 
 ED officials on Thursday visited the sea-facing Mandwa farmhouse at Kolegaon village in Alibaug district of Maharashtra. Official stated they put locked the farmhouse and the garage inside the farmhouse where Mallya’s vintage cars were parked. The farmhouse is registered in the name of Mandwa Farms Pvt Ltd, which is controlled by Mallya, said ED officials. The ED had issued an eviction notice to Mandwa Farms last month and subsequently took possession of the property on Thursday.
 
 The CBI had booked Mallya in a cheating case for defrauding banks while the ED had registered money laundering cases against him for the same reason. Hopwever, Mallya fled to the UK before the investigative agencies could catch him. The court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya in the IDBI case and the government is trying to extradite him to face investigations.
 
 Recently, officials from both the ED and CBI met the UK authorities to explain the case details to them. The CBI had sought Mallya’s extradition in the cheating case and the ED sought his custody under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in the money laundering case.
