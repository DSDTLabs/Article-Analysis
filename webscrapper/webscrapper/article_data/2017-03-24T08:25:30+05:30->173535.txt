BATHINDA: With police failing to solve the January 31 Maur bomb blast case, which claimed six lives, even after 50 days, residents of Maur town in the district held protest outside the the local police station on Thursday. They demanded justice for the families of those killed in the blast.

 “Residents under the banner of ‘Maur Bomb Blast Struggle Committee’ sat outside police station and asked for reasons why the police have failed to solve the case even after nearly two months of the incident. We have held protests earlier too and handed over memorandums to the state government but the police are far from solving the case and arresting the guilty,” panel member Naveen Kumar said.
 
 A blast was triggered from a Maruti 800 when   candidate from Maur constituency Harminder Singh Jassi had completed a street meeting and was passing from the spot.
 
 Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said, “We are making efforts to solve the case. The police teams are out at many places to arrest the accused.”
