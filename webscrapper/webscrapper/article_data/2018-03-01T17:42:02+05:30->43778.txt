HYDERABAD: The first additional metropolitan magistrate court at Nampally has convicted the president of a city-based charitable trust for operating a blood bank without valid licence, separating blood components without expertise and illegally supplying to hospitals.

  
  
 On Tuesday, the court convicted accused Jerripothula   to threeyear rigorous imprisonment and ?1lakh fine. He’s associated with the Transfusion Medicine Blood Bank at Pavani Anasuya Towers, which was set up in Tarnaka in 2005.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Secunderabad   drug Inspector (manufacturing) B Praveen said, “Initially, Transfusion Medicine Blood Bank had a licence to collect and supply whole human blood. In 2009, then drug inspector ordered the Tarnaka-based blood bank to stop production for not complying with rules. Despite the order, accused Madhusudhan shifted the entire equipment to another flat in the same complex and began collecting and distributing blood. In 2010, then drug inspector M Sreenivasulu filed a prosecution case, and during investigation, it was found the accused Madhusudhan despite having no expertise was separating components from whole blood and supplying to hospitals in Tarnaka.”
 
 DCA officials then seized equipment and submitted a prosecution case in the court. In 2012, hearing began and the accused was convicted on Tuesday.   Drug Control Administration joint director T Kailasam told TOI, “Operating an unlicensed blood bank is an offence under Section 18C of Drugs and Cosmetics Act which deals with prohibition of manufacture and sale of certain drugs and cosmetics. Blood is defined as drug under Section 3(b) of Act.”
 
 He said, “In regular process, those wanting to start a blood bank should submit their application to   and obtain NoC. Then the applicant will approach the state drugs department. Officials of both state and central drug control organisations then conduct a joint inspection. Based on the report, a joint certified five-year valid licence is issued.”
