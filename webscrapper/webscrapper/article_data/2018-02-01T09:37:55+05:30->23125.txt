CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh   has prepared a Rs 910.46-crore   proposal for the 2018-19 fiscal, nearly Rs 100 crore less than the budget it had prepared in the last financial year.

 The MC is yet to given a go-ahead to the proposal. The civic body’s newly formed   and contract committee (F&CC) will take a look at it and then it will be tabled in to the MC house for an approval before being sent to the   administration, which will decide on the final amount to be fixed for the MC.
 
 Of the Rs 910.46 crore, the accounts department of the civic body has kept rupees 256.95 crore under the ‘capital’ segment and Rs 653.51 crores have been earmarked for the ‘revenue’ section. Like previous years, this time too the engineering department of the MC has been allocated a large share of the amount (nearly 20%) in the capital segment. The department, which has three crucial wings under it (building and roads, public health, and horticulture), has been allocated Rs 100 crore. 
 
 Compared to the previous two years, the civic body has sought less money than before as it had been earlier criticised for exaggerating the money it needed. “In last two consecutive financial years, the civic body passed and proposed a budget of over Rs 1,000 crore. Due to this, we had been constantly coming under criticism, with many saying that we wre preparing exaggerated figures and were not realistic. Therefore, this time, we went into the details and tried to prepare a realistic budget,” said an official of the MC.
 
 Apart from budgetary figures, the authority has also prepared other financial details regarding the civic body’s income from its sources, the status of its fixed deposits, and its present financial condition.
