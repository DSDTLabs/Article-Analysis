MUMBAI: A video purportedly showing cracks in the “rock-work” done at the Humboldt penguin enclosure in the Byculla zoo recently went viral, prompting BJP leader in the BMC house Manoj Kotak to take a dig at the Shiv Sena by questioning the transparency in the project. 

 Bringing the penguins to the city was a pet project of the Shiv Sena. The BMC soon clarified that there were no cracks or leakage within the enclosure. It said in a statement that the allegations in the video were baseless and that about 3.5 lakh people had visited the zoo since the inauguration of the penguin enclosure on March 18.
