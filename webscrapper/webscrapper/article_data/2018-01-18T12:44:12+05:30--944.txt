INDORE: Amid instances of online frauds, cheating through   cards and fake calls claiming to be from  , the city   convened a   with the bank   here on Wednesday.

 DIG Harinarayanachari Mishra presided over the meeting that lasted over an hour in which all senior police officials and senior officials from several banks participated.
 
 The police urged the bank officials to sensitise customers on the ways to remain cautious about calls made by fraudsters claiming to be from banks and attempting to cheat people by getting to know their password or PIN.
 
  
  
 The participating bank officials were requested to create awareness by playing audio messages, putting up posters outside their establishments and sending bulk SMS to customers to remain vigilant from tricksters, who deceive gullible people.
 
 The law enforcers also asked the banks to install burglar alarms and closed circuit television units in their branches as a security measure.
 
 A few months back, the city police had instructed the city banks to ensure that all the ATM kiosks had CCTV cameras that covered the entire kiosk and not just offered a 90-degree view. The banks were also asked to deploy security personnel at all the ATMs and remove all kinds of films or stickers on the transparent doors of the kiosks that obstructed the view of what was happening inside.
 
 Officials said that not all the ATM kiosks in the city had armed personnel and during the ensuing meeting the bankers were appealed to beef up the security measures.
