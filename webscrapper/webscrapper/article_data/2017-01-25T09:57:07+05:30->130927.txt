PATNA: Rajya Sabha MP and former JD (U) president   on Tuesday said the popularity of   was at its lowest ebb in the history of the grand-old party. 

 “Congress has earned a bad name due to coal, 2G and other scams. Its popularity has hit an all-time low. The party was in a much better position even when the then PM Indira Gandhi had imposed Emergency in the country,” Sharad said while addressing JD (U) members at a function to mark the birth anniversary of former CM Karpoori Thakur at S K Memorial Hall here. Chief minister (CM)  , who is also the president of JD (U), was also present on the occasion. 
 
 Sharad’s statement assumes significance in the light of the fact that he was the first politician to win Lok Sabha seat in 1974 as a   candidate from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh when JP movement was at its peak. What surprised many was the fact that Sharad did not mince words while making such a harsh remark against Congress, an ally of the three-party   government in Bihar.
 
 Reacting sharply to Sharad’s barb, Congress spokesman Prem Chandra Mishra said it was an unwanted comment from a veteran politician. “We will not accept such statements. Sharad should not forget that JD (U) is running the government in Bihar with support of Congress,” Mishra said.
 
 He recalled how Congress stood behind Nitish when CM candidate for Bihar’s grand alliance was to be decided before 2015 assembly polls. “It was Congress which proposed the name of Nitish for CM’s post,” Mishra said. He did not rule out the possibility of Congress taking up the matter with the CM.
 
 However,   distanced itself from Sharad’s statement. “We have nothing to do with the statement of Sharad Yadav,” said RJD MP Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav.
