NEW DELHI: Three  , including a  , were arrested on Friday morning near GTB hospital in Dilshad Garden, northeast Delhi. They were carrying 30 sophisticated weapons manufactured in illegal factories in Madhya Pradesh.

 The gang had hidden the guns in the battery box of an e-rickshaw and were on their way to deliver them to a supplier in northeast Delhi.
 
 “The seized weapons include two automatic carbines of 7.65mm, seven semi-automatic pistols of 9mm, two revolvers of 7.65mm and 19 semi-automatic pistols of 7.65mm,” said DCP (special cell) Pramod Kushwaha.
 
 The weapons are engraved with ‘Made in Etaliya’, ‘Made in Japan’ and ‘Made in USA’. Two carbines and 23 pistols have a spare magazine. The carbines were sold for Rs 50,000, while the price for the pistols was Rs 20,000.
 
 “The three accused — Miskin (30), Jabir (30) and Balu (35) — got off the e-rickshaw and offloaded a large black battery. They were also carrying bags on their shoulders. When the person whom they had to give the weapons didn’t turn up, they decided to leave. They were then nabbed by the police team. Miskin is the kingpin of the gang,” said Kushwah.
 
 When the Special Cell team opened the battery, they found 20 semi-automatic pistols hidden in it. 
 
 The other weapons were in the bags being carried by the accused. On interrogation, they told the police that they had purchased the weapons from Pyarelal alias Sikander, a native of Madhya Pradesh. They had to supply them in Delhi and Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “Two pistols and two revolvers were to be supplied to Nafis Khan of trans-Yamuna area, while two carbines and seven semi-automatic pistols of 9mm were to be given to Jahiruddin and his partner Julfikar alias Guddu in Meerut. The remaining 17 pistols were to be supplied to Mohammad Hafij in Meerut,” Kushwah said.
 
 The gang had supplied arms in Delhi-NCR and UP on several occasions, the details of which are being gathered, police said.
