KOLKATA/HOWRAH: Around 250 students of Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur on Wednesday afternoon   on the campus after 45   from the upcoming semester examination.

 The protesters, sitting in front of gate number 1, demanded the debarred students be made eligible to qualify and appear in the exams for promotion. These students, combining undergraduate and postgraduate candidates, have been debarred to appear in the ‘even’ semester exams as they performed poorly in the sessional and laboratory exams, including in viva voce.
 
 
 IIEST registrar   said, “The debarred students have very low attendance. They also failed to clear the sessional assessment and viva voce exams. Hence, they have been prohibited from appearing in the semester exams. But, now a section of the students is making the unjust demand to allow them in the same.”
 
 Around 3,000 UG and PG students are appearing for the even semester exam. Questions are being raised over only 45 students that is 1.5% of the total student strength. The protesters are yet to submit their demands to us. I have even spoken to the general secretary of the students after talking to the dean of academics. Now, the students are trying to pressurize the institute by raising other baseless issues.” He added, “If we are not allowed to clear the practical exam and viva voca then we shall lose a year.”
 
 Some UG second-year students, however, claimed that the protesters were forcing them to join the agitation. “We are reluctant to join the agitation as it is unfair. Yet, the demonstrating students are entering student halls are pulling us by collar to sit in the demonstration,” added the second year B.Tech student.
 
 Director   will meet the protesters on Thursday.
