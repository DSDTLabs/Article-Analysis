BENGALURU: A city court on Saturday awarded death penalty to a man who was convicted of raping and murdering a six-year-old girl on April 20, 2017, which must now be confirmed by the high court. As the prosecution waits for the HC confirmation,  , 35, will have time to appeal against the order.

 
 Balagar, father of two daughters, has been convicted of murdering the girl after raping her inside his Girinagar residence. Judge M Lathakumari awarded death penalty to Anil for killing the child and 10 years rigorous imprisonment for raping her, apart from slapping a fine of Rs 10,000 on him.
 
 “The girl was playing outside her grandfather’s home, which is opposite Balagar’s house. She went missing at 6.15pm and attempts to find her went in vain. Around 8pm, Balagar informed people that he had to leave for his native place,” public prosecutor   said. He said the convict’s mobile was switched off soon after he left and that the family didn’t find the girl, and lodged a missing complaint. “Three days later, foul smell emanating from Balagar’s house caught the attention of neighbours. On breaking it open, police found the girl’s body,” he said, adding that the judgment has no connection with the recent ordinance passed by the Centre that allows death penalty for those who rape minors.
 
 Investigation proved that the girl was raped before being smothered with a pillow.
