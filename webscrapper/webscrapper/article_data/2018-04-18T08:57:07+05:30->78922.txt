CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Tuesday extended the bail of four persons initially arrested by Haryana police for their alleged involvement in the infamous   gang rape,   and robbery case of Mewat district. Their bail has been extended by four more weeks.

 Earlier on March 7, the HC had granted them bail for six weeks. During the hearing of the case on Tuesday, the CBI, which is probing the case, assured the high court that the investigation of the case would be completed within four weeks. The matter is pending before the HC in the wake of bail petitions filed by four accused Sandeep, Amarjeet, Karamjeet and Rahul Verma, all residents of Mohammadpur Ahir village of Mewat.
 
 The CBI has already informed the HC that it could not find any evidence against these four accused but their investigation in the matter was still going on. These four accused had approached the HC for bail because the CBI had already submitted the charge-sheet against four other accused belonging to ‘axle gang’ for the same offence. The case had hit the national headlines when on the night of August 24, 2016, a family at Dingerheri village was attacked. While a Muslim couple was killed, several members of their family were injured and a 21-year-old woman and a 16-year-old girl of the family were raped.
 
 The case was initially registered on August 25, 2016, by Haryana police. The state police had claimed success in the case after they arrested four local youths within four days of the crime. Later, the case was handed over to the CBI.
 
 On September 13, 2017, Gurgaon police had arrested Hemant Chauhan, Ayan Chauhan, Vinay and Jai Bhagwan of the ‘axle gang’. They are now in the judicial custody. During the CBI probe these accused had confessed to their involvement in the Dingerheri case and a charge-sheet had also been submitted against them before a special CBI court, Panchkula.
