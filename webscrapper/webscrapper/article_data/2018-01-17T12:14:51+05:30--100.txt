Trivikram Srinivas’  ,   and   starrer ‘Agnyaathavaasi’ has joined the $2 Million club, as of Sunday. 

 
 
  The film grossed $87K in the US on Sunday, entering the $2M club. Even though the film has received negative reviews from critics and audience alike, the filmmakers are working hard to generate interest. From Sankranti, a cameo scene with Victory Venkatesh has also been introduced, hoping to draw audience to the theatres. 
 
  The makers are said to have chopped 12 minutes of footage from the original release to add in the cameo scenes. A branding studio from Hyderabad posted on social media, “Agnyaathavaasi update! 12 minutes footage chopped off and 7 minutes 26 seconds new footage added including #VictoryVenkatesh scenes. Behind scenes of #PawanKalyan and #Venkatesh during recording.” (sic)
 
 
 
  The negative feedback ‘Agnyaathavaasi’ received took a toll on the film at the box office, witnessing an 80% drop at the worldwide box office on day two. The theatrical rights for the film were said to be sold at a massive Rs 125 Cr. However, the film is Pawan Kalyan’s first film to join the $2M club.
