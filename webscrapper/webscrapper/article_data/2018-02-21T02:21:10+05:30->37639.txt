GHAZIABAD: The Basic Shiksha Adhikari ( ) has issued   notices to 10   in Crossings Republik for allegedly running nursery and KG classes without registration. An official said the schools needed to take permission for operating these classes from the education department.

 “Playschools are mushrooming all over the city and many of them have even started  , which is against the rule. A list of such schools is being compiled with the help of block education officers and a monitoring committee will soon be formed to keep tabs on them,” said  , the BSA. 
 
 He added that the education department did not have any issue if the playschools were running on pre-nursery classes. 
 
 Among the schools that have been issued notices are some prominent names that have branches all over the country. 
 
 In case of non-compliance of the current notice, a fine of Rs 1 lakh will also be imposed on the school under the provisions of the RTE Act, added Kumar.
 
 Notably, the action against playschools has been initiated after reports of a school helper allegedly sexually assaulting a girl student at one such institution in Sahibabad surfaced in the first week of February.
 
 An FIR had been registered against the school helper on February 2 on a complaint from the parents of the three-and-half-year-old girl. The parents had alleged that the helper had sexually assaulted their daughter several times over a period of one year.
 
 Following the incident, the BSA had conducted an inspection of the preschool and found it to be running Nursery and KG classes.
