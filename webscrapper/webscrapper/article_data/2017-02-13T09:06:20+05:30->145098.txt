TRICHY: Forty per cent of companies in the country are not in a position to pay interest on their borrowings, said  ,   on  , at an event held here on Sunday. 

 The government has disbursed a total of Rs 65 lakh crore as loan to the industrial sector across the country, of which Rs 7.50 lakh crore has been given to ten group of companies by nationalized banks, said Venkatesh. “We either treat the industrialist as God and pour funds or portray them as villains if they fail to repay interest of the principle amount. But the reality is that they cannot earn to pay the interest at least,” he said.
 
 “Market capitalization of shares of HDFC bank is greater than the market capitalization of around 15 public sector banks. As a result total credit to the corporate sector has been decelerating steadily,” he said. Though there was no such risks in MSMEs, banks are not coming forward to give any loan, as they do not have courage to disburse the same, he alleged. 
 
 He said that despite the growth rate being at 7 per cent, there is no employment for youths due to mechanization. “This problem can be addressed if the growth rate doubles,” said Venkatesh.
 
 He hailed the recent budget announcement that one cannot donate more than Rs 2,000 to any political parties in cash. “This initiative will pave way to avert corruption,” he added.
