There is more to Sharwanand’s Obsessive Cleanliness Disorder in  , than what meets the eye — an implicit   endorsement. “The government is striving to create a clean India; and many kids are cleaning up roads but sadly a lot of ‘wise people’ are still continuing to litter and ruin the environment. I selected the cleanliness theme to show that it’s good to be clean, but everyone should strive for it. That’s one of the indirect messages in the film,” says  .

 
 The film charts the journey of a self confessed ‘cleanliness freak’, Anand who goes to hilariously great lengths to keep himself clean. Apparently, the inspiration for the character came from the rising ‘hygiene consciousness’ among people around us. “People seem to be getting increasingly obsessed with cleanliness. When we were kids, there wasn’t even a concept of paper napkin, and yet, we were sanitary. But now, people are prone to be obsessed with cleanliness and in the process, I feel that they’re losing out on emotions,” says Maruti, adding, “When a loved one wants to cook for you and feed you by hand, you’re too busy wondering if their hands are clean and how they cooked the food. We’re missing out on love due to our obsession with hygiene.”

This is his best work yet, and the audience will find a new actor in Sharwa,” he says adding, “Mahanubhavudu is the perfect film to watch with loved ones. We haven’t seen a good love story after Fidaa, and I think the love track between Sharwa and Mehreen in the film will match it”
