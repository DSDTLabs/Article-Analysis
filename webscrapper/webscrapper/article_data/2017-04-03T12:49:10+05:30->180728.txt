 NAINITAL: More than 5,000 students of   and 52 affiliated colleges taking to bachelor of education   were thrown into a tizzy on Saturday after they found the question paper of ‘Psychology of Learner’ incomplete.
 
  The question paper, which was bearing full marks of 70, had questions carrying only 40 marks. After examinees informed the authorities about the anomaly, questions for the rest 30 marks were typed and sent to the colleges immediately.
 
  University officials, however, said an inquiry was marked into the laxity.
  
  Upset over the anomaly, university examination controller Rajnish Pandey said they had sent a complete question paper for printing, and it would have to be looked into as to how incomplete papers came and were distributed among students.
  
  “We had sent complete question paper for printing; it is a matter of investigation. This kind of laxity will not be tolerated. I have marked an inquiry, and am waiting for the report.”
  
  RS Pathni, dean, education department at university, said, “This is a gross violation, and is unacceptable in any circumstances. Those who are responsible will be held accountable for this laxity.”
 
    (25), a student, said, “Initially, we panicked, and informed invigilators about the anomaly. However, soon, we got some more questions to complete the paper.”
