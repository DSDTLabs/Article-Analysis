KOLKATA: A day after three Jadavpur residents were arrested for allegedly threatening cricketer   and assaulting his caretaker after an argument over parking, his family members and neighbours are still in shock. They can't believe that a person as amicable as Shami has fallen victim to road rage, that too in his own locality.

 "When we reached home on Saturday , three cars were already parked in front of our house. Yet, we managed to leave space for other vehicles to pass. But this man picked up an argument. It seemed to have been settled but they just barged inside our house minutes later. They kept kicking on our door for 10 minutes. I am still living in fear and shock. Ever since we came here, we have faced one problem or the other. Though nothing major has happened so far, we do feel insecure," said Hasin Jahan, Shami's wife.
 
 Many see Saturday's incident as an assault on the 'para' (community) culture that the neighbourhood takes pride on. "Imagine people attacking their own neighbours on the flimsiest of grounds. This is the saddest part of the entire incident. The attack comes after Md Shami spent hours chatting to the same group near Stylist Tailors even after attaining stardom," rued Amiya Kumar Bagchi, a resident of Katju Nagar.
