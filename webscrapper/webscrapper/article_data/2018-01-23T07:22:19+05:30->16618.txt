BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court tore into state’s bureaucracy on Monday, saying officials fail to respond to petitions in “hundreds of cases” and act only when faced with the threat of jail for contempt of court. The court was upset over repeated requests for adjournments by government and officials.

 “Every time, government advocates seek two or four weeks to respond. We see this happening not once or twice but in  . Officials don’t care about government advocates. It is only when they face the threat of going to jail in   under contempt of court, they act swiftly and things happen in 24 hours,” acting chief justice HG Ramesh said. The observation came after authorities sought more time in a PIL against construction of a building in Kolnadu of   taluk in  . On December 8, 2017, the government had agreed to take action on the submission made in June.
 
 
 
 
 The bureaucracy has become incompetent. How can we run the administration?” the bench asked the petitioner’s counsel when he pressed for directions in the matter, including cutting off power supply to the illegally constructed building.
 
 The bench disposed of the PIL filed by  , directing the panchayat development officer of Kolnadu to act on the representation in four weeks. The authorities were also told to take police help if necessary. The bench said if the authorities don’t take any action, the petitioner is free to initiate contempt proceedings.
