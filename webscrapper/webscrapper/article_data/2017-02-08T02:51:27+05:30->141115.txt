MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday said the state government must equally take care of citizens’ interests as it does of builders and ruthlessly stop destruction of   near Mumbai.

 Wetlands include marshy areas, estuaries, creeks, tanks, ponds, reservoirs, lakes and other water bodies. The court has sought old and latest   “to compare the extent of damage to the environment by virtue of damage to wetlands and in the future to ensure it can be restored to its original state”.
 
 “The ideal thing to do is to take out Google maps. It will make things very clear,” said a bench of Justice Vidyasagar Kanade and Justice P R Bora who heard a PIL for preservation of wetlands. The court has passed orders banning construction on and reclamation of wetlands.
 
 The judges said it remains to be seen what steps the authorities and corporations take to restore the wetlands. It was then that Justice Kanade remarked, “The state government should equally consider the interests of citizens as it considers the interests of builders.” The bench batted for areas like Mira Bhayander, Uttan and Panvel saying “Steps have to be taken to ensure that wetlands don’t disappear”. Justice Kanade said, “Ruthlessly stop it.”
 
 CIDCO’s advocate said the new airport in Navi Mumbai will be affected and urged “that a window be kept to approach the court for permission”. The judges clarified that so far as public utilities if permissions are taken from authorities they will not interfere. 
 
 Noting that the state has submitted a brief document in respect of wetlands in forest areas, it directed it to submit the document of non-forest areas within four weeks.
