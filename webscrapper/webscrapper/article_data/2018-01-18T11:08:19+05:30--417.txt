BHUBANESWAR: Panic gripped Puri railway station after a   in the   of a   on platform No. 2 on Wednesday.   said no one was present in the pantry or in other coaches when the explosion took place. The pantry car was badly damaged. 

 Two employees of a pantry car of Dhauli Express, stationed on the adjacent platform No.1, were injured after being hit by splinters from the cylinder. Divisional railway manager (Khurda) Brijmohan Agarwal said a locally-filled 5-kg portable cylinder went off. 
 
 "We do not know as to how the military train carried the local-made cylinder, the use of which is strictly prohibited in trains. We will send our report to the defence ministry for action," Agarwal told TOI. 
 
 The railway protection force (RPF) personnel seized the exploded cylinder. Damage would have been worse had 12 other cylinders stored in the pantry burst. "We immediately mobilized fire tenders and doused the fire. We have not come across any foul play," a RPF officer said. 
 
 Railways said the train belonged to INS-Chilka and was scheduled to move towards Mumbai on Thursday. The empty train was brought to Puri from Delang station for some repair. The train arrived at Puri around 4.50 pm and was supposed to move towards the railway yard when the mishap took place around 5.03 pm.
