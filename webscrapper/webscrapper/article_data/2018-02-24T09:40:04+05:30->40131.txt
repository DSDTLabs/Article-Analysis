BENGALURU: Two seasoned players on a comeback trail will feature in the Indian women’s   team’s campaign at the five-match series against Korea from March 3-12 in Jinchun.

 
 The series will be crucial for defender   and striker   who missed a better part of last year’s competitions. While Deepika was out due to an ACL tear, Poonam has recovered from a twin blow of an ankle injury followed by a fractured right elbow. Both players went under the knife followed by rehabilitation and New Delhi and Bengaluru respectively.
 
 The soft-spoken Poonam, who recently celebrated her 25th birthday, sustained an ankle injury while competing in the Nationals. After a few months of rehabilitation, she returned to the camp for the tour of Netherlands in August, but a freak injury during training ended her season.
 
 “Last year was the toughest year of my life. First I twisted my ankle badly during Nationals. Then before we left for Holland, during a practice match against the boys the goalkeeper’s kick landed on my elbow and it was fractured and they had to fix it with plates,” recalled Poonam.
 
 Deepika one of the best defenders in recent times for India is well aware of the competition from the youngsters in the team and is hoping to give her best in Korea. “Last year’s Nationals turned out to be the sour point for me when I slipped and tore a ligament. But I’ve put the injury behind me,” said the newly-wed Deepika.
