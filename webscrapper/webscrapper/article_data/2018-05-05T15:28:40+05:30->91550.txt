TEHRAN: Iranian President   is criticising the blocking of the popular Telegram messaging app in the  , suggesting those "at the highest level" in the country shut off access.

 
 Rouhani, a relatively moderate cleric within  's Shiite theocracy, did not elaborate in his online comments late on Friday but they seem aimed at redirecting domestic anger over the blocking of the app, believed to be used by half of Iran's 80 million people. The app was crucial in fanning nationwide protests in December and January.
 
 Authorities temporarily blocked the app to calm the demonstrations, but Iran's judiciary on Monday ordered internet service providers to block access to the app. Since then, users largely haven't been able to access it.
 
 Tehran's prosecutor also ordered Telegram be blocked in a way that would not allow users to bypass the restrictions using a virtual private network or other means. Computer-savvy Iranians routinely use such VPNs to get around online restrictions in the country to use Facebook, Twitter and other prohibited sites.
 
 In a post on photo-sharing app Instagram, which isn't blocked in Iran, Rouhani wrote: "No social network or messenger were blocked 'by this government' and won't be blocked."
 
 "If at the highest level of the system a decision has been made to restrict or block the people's communications, the real owners of this country, which are the people, should be aware of this," Rouhani added.
 
 The semi-official   news agency also reported his remarks.
