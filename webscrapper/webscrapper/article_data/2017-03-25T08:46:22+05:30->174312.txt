DEHRADUN: In alarming news, it has emerged that cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR -B) doubled in the state in a year, soaring to 50 in 2016 from just 24 in 2015. XDR-TB involves resistance to the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. 

 According to the latest report released by the health ministry, Uttarakhand registered 10,450  . In 2011, 147,54 incidences of TB had been recorded.
 
  Experts said that the number of TB cases may show a downward trend, but there is little reason to cheer as rising cases of Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) pose a huge challenge to the country. In Uttarakhand, 364 cases of MDR TB cases were recorded in 2016 while only 17 such cases were recorded in 2011. According to data by the health department, most cases of MDR-TB were recorded in Haridwar, Dehradun, Udham Singh Nagar and Nainital. Most patients are in the age group of 18 to 38.
 
 In India, an estimated 1.3 lakh incidences of multi-drug resistant TB are recorded. Of this, 79,000 cases are of MDR-TB. Head of department of TB and Chest of Government Doon Medical College Hospital, Dr Rameshwar, said, "MDR-TB is on the rise also because newer cases are being picked up with better technology and infrastructure. Sometimes, TB drugs are used indiscriminately to treat community acquired pneumonia without confirming first whether it is really bacterial pneumonia or tuberculosis. Sometimes, patients leave treatment halfway which also contributes to the rise in such cases."
 
  Experts also said that since many people go to private clinics for treatment, cases may go unnoticed. Dr   from the department of Pulmonary Medicine,  , where Garhwal region's MDR-TB testing lab is located, said, "There are several reasons for the spread of the disease. Sale of anti TB drugs over the counter needs to be banned.
