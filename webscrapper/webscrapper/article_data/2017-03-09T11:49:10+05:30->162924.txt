Fake accounts of celebrities and actor’s social media pages, which were hacked, had led to a lot of ruckus of late. Singer Suchithra Karthik’s tweets were allegedly hacked as well. The latest one to fall prey to it is actress-singer  , who has recently proclaimed on social media, about the same. 

  He posted,“ Hello there.. looks like my page is hacked. So please ignore the posts till I confirm otherwise. Thank you. P.S. the twitter posts that appear on my behalf are also not mine. (sic).”
