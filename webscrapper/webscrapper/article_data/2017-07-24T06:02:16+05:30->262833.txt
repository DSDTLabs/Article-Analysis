KOLKATA:  , who had supported the candidature of   as the presidential candidate against  , will leave for New Delhi on Monday to attend Kovind's swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday. But she is likely to use her visit to stitch together the numbers for  , who is opposition's vice presidential candidate. 

 According to sources, the importance she attaches to Gandhi's nomination can be gauged by the fact that the chief minister had even skipped Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony in 2014. 
 
 The decision to attend the swearing-in of Kovind comes after her fiery rhetoric on Friday against BJP. The chief minister, though, indicated that political courtesy demands she honours the Rashtrapati Bhawan invite.
 
 Banerjee may use her Parliament visit on Wednesday to meet some of the opposition leaders to make strategies for the vice-presidential polls that will be held on August 5. Gandhi is pitted against M Venkaiah Naidu and Banerjee appears keen to use her stay in Delhi to push Gandhi's prospects, for which she might stay in Delhi till Thursday.
 
 It is still not clear whether the chief minister will meet the Prime Minister or any other senior members of the Modi cabinet. Banerjee recently flagged her concerns on the Modi government's foreign policy that, according to her, was triggering unrest on Bengal borders. She had also spoken against the overzealousness of certain sections that was causing communal restiveness in Bengal. The Darjeeling impasse also entered its 39th day on Sunday.
 
 The Rashtrapati Bhawan invite reached her on Saturday. To factor in her three-day visit, which can be stretched by another day, her schedule in Kolkata had to be tweaked. Earlier, the Kanyashree celebrations after Banerjee was awarded in The Hague was scheduled on Tuesday. It has now been deferred to July 28.
