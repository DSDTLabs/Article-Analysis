Trichy: The chief preacher of an AG church in Karumandapam was arrested by the city crime branch (CCB) for cheating a   company of Rs 6.88 crore on the promise of selling them a land in a prime location in Trichy. 

 CCB police arrested Norman Baskar, 64 the chief preacher and the court remanded him in judicial custody on Tuesday. Baskar landed in the police net when he came to the city after absconding for few months.
 
 “Initially, he got an interim bail in connection with the case. After the bail period was over, he evaded arrest for nearly three months. On Tuesday, we caught him,” CCB inspector Kosalai Raman told TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 Police said they received a complaint from VGP real estate against Norman Baskar in 2016. According to their complaint, the preacher had agreed to sell a land and a building of the church to the real estate firm in 2011. It was said that the property was estimated at Rs 7 crore. 
 
 The buyer had paid 6.88 crore to Baskar soon after the agreement and assured to settle the balance after registration of the property to the real estate firm. Agreeing to the deal, Baskar assured to register the property. However, he dragged the registration process for several months. Repeated reminders from the real estate firm failed to yield any favourable result. When the firm insisted on cancelling the deal and urged Baskar to return the money, there was no positive reply from him. 
 
 Eventually, they approached the city police in 2016 and lodged a complaint against the preacher for cheating them. CCB police registered a case in August 2016. Baskar got an interim bail which got over few months back following which the police have been trying to arrest him. Finally, he was arrested on Tuesday.
