LUCKNOW: The   for class 10 and 12 was started at 23 centres in the city on Monday.

 After a gap of nine years,   board examination has been reintroduced from this year after the government decided to do away with the   (CCE) adopted earlier.
 
 As per students, it was an easy examination day for both class X and XII.
 
 “As it was after a long gap that the board examination was being reintroduced in class X, we were expecting a tough paper but it was not so,” said class X student Divyyansha Dixit.
 
 All class X students who appeared in vocational courses such as dynamic retailing, info technology and others found the paper easy.
 
  students also shared that the English paper was easier as compared to the previous year’s with no ‘twisted questions’.
 
 “All students of my batch have gone through the last year board examination paper during preparation. This year’s paper was much easier as compared to the previous one,” said Class XII student Akshara Singh. She said the entire paper was simple, just the comprehension section was a bit lengthy.
 
 Many students said despite knowing the answers, they could not do all comprehension questions due to lack of time.
