NAGPUR: Saints transcended boundaries of language and took devotion to a new high. In the present era, youths in the age group of 18 to 22 have been following their teachings in true sense of the term by presenting compositions of the saints in different styles though the aim remains the same — of worship. 

 Winners of ‘Bhajan Samrat’ junior title session-I, organized by a TV channel, the youths had no inhibitions about a particular style though they are exponents of Carnatic music. They presented devotional songs in south Indian and Maharashtrian styles at  , organized by Asthika Samaj at Bhagawati Sabhagruha, and had the devotees in thrall, on Thursday.
 
 The youths, who presented songs in praise of Lord Ram and other gods and goddesses, are the students of   and SV Usha West Mambalam, Chennai.
 
 The celebrations began with ‘Harernameva Nameva Mama Jeevanam, a special namasankeerthanam. The bhajans were presented by GS Sruthi, S Sruthi, Simdhuja S, Vatsalya Thubsidharan and Akshaya S. They were accompanied by Sriram on mridangam and Ramsharan on harmonium. 
 
 The beauty of the programme was the way they merged the south Indian music with Maharashtrian style of presenting bhajans, traditional in some cases. 
 
 Like the devotees of Lord Vitthal, the young singers also chanted ‘Dnyandev-Tukaram’ at regular intervals and even used ‘chiplya’, a typical Maharashtrian instrument. They presented the bhajans written by Thyagaraja, Sadasiva Brahmendra, Adi Sankara and Vijay Gopalam. In doing so, they used the ‘catche’ line while presenting the bhajans of south Indian saints.
 
 The celebrations concluded with Marathi abhangs written by sant Tukaram on Lord Vitthal.
 
 A Jagdeesan, a member of the  , said, “Our saints and philosophers have written scriptures with the underlying message of life. Throughout centuries, music has been the medium to convey philosophy of life. It not only strengthens cultural ties but also develops a sense of togetherness.”
