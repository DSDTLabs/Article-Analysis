PUNE: Around 25 passengers on board a CNG-operated PMPML bus had a close shave as the vehicle caught fire on Monday, the day when Naina Gunde took over the transport utility as its new chairperson and managing director. 

 The bus was plying between   and Bhosari when it caught fire following some sparks near the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation office.
 
 “The driver noticed the fire in his cabin and alerted the commuters, who managed to rush out of the vehicle in time. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. It seems there was a short circuit in the electrical system,” Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) public relations officer Subhash Gaikwad said.
 
 Sources said the bus was among the fleet of 200 CNG buses the PMPML had taken over from a private contractor after Gunde’s predecessor, Tukaram Mundhe, terminated the contract with it. The state government transferred   last week.
