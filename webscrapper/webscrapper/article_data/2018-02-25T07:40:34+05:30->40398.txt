NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley slammed regulators, along with bank managements and auditors, on Saturday for their failure to detect bank frauds saying "politicians are accountable but regulators are not" - a statement interpreted as signalling the government's displeasure over the Reserve Bank of India's failure to scream fraud on the Rs 11,300-crore PNB case. 

 "We must always remember that regulators have a very important function. They ultimately decide the rules of the game and they have to have a third eye kept perpetually open and turned towards the sector. But unfortunately, in (the) Indian system, we politicians are accountable, the regulators are not," Jaitley said at the Economic Times Global Business Summit when asked whether there was need for introspection on the part of regulators.
 
 Earlier, in a rare move, the finance ministry had sought details from RBI regarding possible systemic failures linked to the Nirav Modi-Mehul Choksi-triggered fraud at PNB. 
 
 Jaitley's comments come a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised "strict action" against those engaging in financial manipulation and sought tight monitoring and surveillance to guard against misuse of public funds. Earlier in the week, the finance minister had criticised the role of errant companies, bank managements and auditors but had only suggested that supervisors act tough against wrongdoers to prevent "stray cases" from becoming the norm.
 
  
  
 
 But on Saturday, he did some tough talking. “They call for every person in position with whatever responsibility to undertake to perform his job and where regulation is lacking, it needs to be strengthened. Ultimately, if fraud is taking place in multiple branches of the banking system and you do not have a single employee raising the red flag, is that not worrisome for the country as a whole?” the FM said. The comment came in response to a question whether episodes of fraud may lead to tighter regulation.
