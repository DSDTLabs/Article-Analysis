New Delhi: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor dubbed the police chargesheet accusing him of abetting the suicide of his wife Sunanda Pushkar as “preposterous” which he would “contest vigorously” even as Congress accused the   top brass led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using Delhi Police to hound its leader.

 Tharoor tweeted, “No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part. If this is conclusion arrived at after four-plus years of investigation, it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of Delhi Police. In October 2017, the law officer made a statement in   that they have not found anything against anyone and now in six months, they say that I have abetted a suicide. Unbelievable!”
 
 Defending Tharoor, Congress said the the central government was using the city police to trouble its party MP.
 
 “The BJP leadership has been conspiring against Tharoor and has used the police as well as media trial to malign him. They sent the evidence to laboratories around the world and after failing to persuade any laboratory to frame Tharoor, they have decided to withdraw the murder charge and proceeded with abetment to suicide. Nobody believes it. The BJP including PM Modi are behind this,” Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said.
 
 He said there was no suicide note in the case nor was there any statement from any family member or otherwise before the police to suggest Tharoor was responsible. “This charge is coming from the BJP headquarters, from the PM and from the home ministry. We reject the charge,” Surjewala added.
