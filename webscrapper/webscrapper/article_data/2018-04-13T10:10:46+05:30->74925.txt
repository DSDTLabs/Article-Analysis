UDAIPUR: Two labourers were killed after huge marble slabs fell on them when the truck in which they were seated was hit by another truck from behind on Thursday. The incident happened in the afternoon on the   near Sukher in Udaipur city. The bodies are yet to be identified and have been kept in the mortuary as police was trying to contact the truck owners to get details. The injured persons have been admitted in nearby hospitals, police said. 

 The first truck, which was a mini, was loaded with marble slabs and two labourers were sitting on the back side with the load. The other truck suddenly rammed into the mini truck which collided with the road divider and turned upside down. The marble slabs fell from the truck and the labourers were caught underneath the huge load. They died on the spot while the cabin of the second truck was badly smashed and the driver and two other people were caught inside.
 
 People gathered in large numbers and pulled the cabin portion with the help of ropes to help the people get out. Two of them are said to be in critical condition while the third man is out of danger. A huge jam was caused by the accident as a bee-line of vehicles was seen on the road due to the accident. Traffic remained disturbed for over an hour until a crane was called to clear the stone pieces from the road. Meanwhile, police said that the actual reason for the accident would be known only after the statement of the victims are recorded. The labourers weren't carrying identity cards and hence their identities too would only be revealed after the transport owner is contacted.
