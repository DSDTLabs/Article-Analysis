BHOPAL: Dressed as groups of ‘baraatis’, taxmen launched a dramatic operation against two oil companies in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday.

 To maintain operational secrecy in the badlands of Chambal, the I-T team adopted an elaborate ploy — to pose as wedding guests. Thursday being an auspicious day for marriages, no one would give a second glance at such a cavalcade. Tax officials hired more than 150 cars from a private operator and pasted stickers that said ‘Ankur weds Swati’ and ‘Chaturvedi pariwar apka swagat karta hai’ on the front and rear windshields.
 
 
 Around 200 officials dressed in their party best boarded these cars and set off at dawn on simultaneous raids. To a passerby, they looked like any other wedding party and the teams managed to retain surprise until they struck 20 locations at 5.30am. By end of day, 10 more addresses had been added, including some in Rajasthan.
 
 Searches were conducted on BR Oil Industry, owned by Suresh Chandra Jindal ‘Sukka’, and Laxmi Oil Mill of Narayan Hari Gupta. Both residential and company premises were searched.
 
 
 
 
 An official said, “Searches were planned on a massive scale and it was not possible to source vehicles for all officials. Any leak would have spoiled the operation.”
 
 Taxi drivers were not allowed to use their cellphones until they dropped the officials at their respective destinations.
 
 "Morena is a small district and the team had to prevent leak of information. Taxi operations in the area are well connected, ” the official added.
 
 Taxi owners were informed that drivers will not be allowed to use their phones,” said the official. Morena police provided security to I-T officials. Officials have reportedly seized a large quantity of documents during the search which is likely to continue till Friday.
