SURAT: It’s not only the building height restrictions that is obstructing the development of Surat airport for the past many years, but it is the safety of buried sour gas pipelines of the Oil and   ( ) passing through airport and the proposed runway extension project which is cause for concern. 

 In December 2017, ONGC’s pipeline group, western offshore, had invited expression of interest (EoI) to hire consultants to chalk out protection measures for the 36 inch diameter and 42 inch diameter sour gas pipelines. The scope of work included the suitable protection of buried pipelines at Surat airport in compliance with the international and national safety standards and operating practices. 
 
 The EOI further stated that both the 36 inch and 42 inch diameter   Bassein Hazira Trunk (SBHT) pipelines were laid in the year 1985 and 1996 respectively to transport sour dry natural gas from Bassein Platform A (BPA) and Bassein Platform B (BPB) offshore process platforms to onshore gas processing plant located at Hazira. 
 
 As on date, the volume of gas being transported is around 33-36 million metric standard cubic metre per day (MMSCMD) and 2,500-3000 cubic metre per day (m3/day) of condensate at an operating pressure of 60-80 kg per sq cm (kg/cm2).
 
 ONGC raised concerns about the safe operation of both the pipelines due to proximity of runway of Surat airport located at Magdalla, which has undergone extension from 1,400 m to 2,250 m towards route of 42 inches diameter pipeline in south east direction in 2007 and from 2,250 m to 2,905 m towards route 36 inch diameter pipeline in north west direction in 2015-16. 
 
 At present, the 36 inch diameter pipeline is 250 m away from the runway and 42 inch pipeline is 350 m away. Further, the proposed extension from 2,905 m to 3,705 m towards route of 36 inch pipeline will cross the pipeline and could create safety issues. 
 
 Talking to TOI, RTI activist Rajesh Modi said, “The Surat airport’s development is not possible due to NEWS (height restriction in the North, ONGC in the East, shrimp ponds in the West and private land acquisition in the South). However, there is no other option but to shift the airport to Jalalpore taluka.”
