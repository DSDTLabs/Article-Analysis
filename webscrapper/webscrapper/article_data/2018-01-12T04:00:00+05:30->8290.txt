Vadodara: Regional Transport Office (RTO) cracked down on school van drivers on Thursday evening for flouting the rules. Twenty two schools vans were detained by the RTO from different areas of the city.

 RTO officials said that the vehicles detained were not registered as transport vehicles and were being driven around as private ones. On Thursday morning, the RTO officials were keeping a watch around schools in different areas and the vans which were used as private vehicles were detained.
 
 “The issue had come to our notice long back and we had called the members of the association to warn them, yet they did not re-register their vehicles as transport vehicles. Therefore we had to the stringent action,” said Vadodara regional transport officer D D Pandya.
 
 After detention of the school vans, it also came to the fore that most of them did not have insurance and proper registration documents. RTO officials pointed out that besides the economic loss, ferrying private vehicles is dangerous for the lives of school children.
 
 “Once these vehicles are registered as transport vehicles, the vehicle owner will have to get the fitness report of the car renewed every two years, there will also be restrictions on the speed and the owner will compulsorily have to have reflectors on the car,” said Pandya.
 
 According to RTO officials, they will fine the vehicle owners and release them with a condition that they re-register them as transport vehicles.
 
 In July last year, RTO had taken similar action against school drivers after a van had overturned at Muktanand circle in Karlibaug. Two days after the mishap in which eight students were injured, RTO had detained 29 vans and lodged cases against 58 drivers for violation of various rules.
