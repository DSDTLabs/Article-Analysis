Vadodara: In one of the biggest liquor hauls in the region after stricter prohibition law was put in place, the   (RRC) of the Panchmahal police seized liquor worth Rs 55.77lakh being ferried in a container on the   highway.

 The Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) was smuggled into the state from Goa.
 
 RRC sleuths had received a tip-off regarding the movement of liquor and intercepted the truck carrying the container near Sakli. It contained 94,668 bottles of IMFL.
 
 Officials said that the truck driver  , a resident of Tamil Nadu, was arrested and his cellular phone and the truck worth Rs 10lakh were also impounded.
 
 RRC police sub-inspector B R Rabari said that the liquor was to be delivered to Ramesh Kalal, a resident of Salopat in Rajasthan. “It was to be unloaded in Dahod district where Sushil Jaiswal and   from Dahod were to take care of it,” he said. Rabari added that the stock was loaded by Mahesh alias  , a resident of Goa.
 
 Rabari said that all the accused were involved in bootlegging cases in the past. The truck had also made several trips to the state over the last one year. Even Kalal and Tanna had been named in liquor-related offences since 2008. “They have been in this illegal business for quite some time now,” Rabari said.
