PUNE: The civic body has no proposal to   development plans for the old city area, 23 merged villages and the proposed DP for the 11 hamlets brought under it recently. 

 Instead, the   will go ahead with a comprehensive transport plan for the entire city.   city engineer Prashant Waghmare on Wednesday said a specific locality or village merged with the civic limits was considered as a unit while drafting the development plans (DP). 
 
 “Connectivity and transport are the only overarching part that connects old and new city. Accordingly, we are going ahead with a transport plan for the entire city. There is no need for any separate comprehensive plan for the city,” he told TOI. 
 
 Waghmare added that the civic body will start preparing a DP for the 11 new merged villages once the state government issues a notification. 
 
 Urban planners are, however, unhappy with the civic body’s stand. “The PMC’s disintegrated approach will lead to imbalanced development in the city. Twenty-three villages, which have already been merged, are reeling under lack of basic amenities. All parts of the city must grow together and with the same speed. A comprehensive approach towards development is the key to sustainable growth,” urban planner Ramchandra Gohad said. 
 
 “There is utter chaos in development planning in the Pune region. There is no coordination and cooperation between civic bodies and   (PMRDA),” he added.
 
 Activist and urban planner Aneeta Benninger-Gokhale said Pune was suffering from “infrastructure and planning deficit” and the civic body has not been able to manage the current population and its requirements. 
 
 “It is likely that the additional resources meant for the newly merged villages will be usurped by the city,” she said.
