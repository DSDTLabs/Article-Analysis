THANE: It was a sweet surprise for the elderly as a bunch of youngsters decided to celebrate the festival of colours with them by offering puran polis. Senior citizens living away from their loved ones in old age homes celebrated   with the members of an NGO   (PAWS). 

 The youngsters had decided to celebrate the festival on a different note. So, instead of throwing colours and spraying water on friends and relatives, they went to old age   and distributed Holi sweetmeats. Besides old age homes, they also distributed puran polis to beggars, fruit vendors and at orphanages.
 
 “We asked locals to give us puran polis so that we could distribute them among those who really are in need of it and cannot celebrate the festival with their loved ones. Usually people offer these delicacies to the Holika, which is just burnt and turns into ash. So we requested the residents to offer just one puran poli to the Holika and give the rest to us. We collected 260 puran polis and distributed it to orphans, senior citizens and beggars in Mumbra, Kalwa, Dombivli and other areas of the city,” said Nilesh Bhanage, founder of PAWS.
 
 Senior citizens were happy to get homemade Holi delicacies. But what made them more happy and content was that they could celebrate the festival with someone. “I got to know about the initiative through my friend. So I collected a few polis from my neighbours and friends and went to celebrate the festival with the NGO members. We visited an old age home in Dombivli. The grandmothers and grandfathers couldn’t stop smiling when they saw us. They mentioned how after years they were celebrating the festival with someone. They described about the times they celebrated it with their families. They had tears in their eyes when they went back in time describing about how they used to celebrate the festival. We fed the polis to them with our hands as we kept listening to their childhood stories,” said Sadhana Sabharwal, a volunteer.
