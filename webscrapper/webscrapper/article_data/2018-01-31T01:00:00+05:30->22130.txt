This party at a city pub was sheer testimony to how happening Chennai’s nightlife is these days. Since it was a weekend, these party animals trickled into the pub quite early. But that was no reason for them to leave the place in a hurry. The peeps let their hair down and danced as the party mood picked up with the DJ’s electrifying music. The ladies turned up for the do in chic outfits and rocked the style-o-meter. Among others, our photog spotted a few expats at the nightclub, who were living it up. While others were busy on the dance floor, these guests posed for the shutterbugs with grins spread wide across their faces.
