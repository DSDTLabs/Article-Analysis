NEW DELHI: The Delhi   court on Wednesday sought to know from the government why chewing of   shouldn’t be banned, as such a step would end the problem posed by gutka and pan masala.

 HC asked the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for its stand on the issue and also wished to know if such a step had been taken by the Centre or any state government. While ‘gutka’ is a mild stimulant made of areca nut, tobacco and other intoxicants, ‘pan masala’ is a mixture of betel leaf with lime, areca nut and other items.
 
 “Have you considered banning it? If you say that   is per se harmful, has anyone banned it? You know, if you (authorities) ban it the whole problem would be over,” Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said.
 
 The FSSAI submitted there is no need to separately ban chewing of tobacco as the notifications banning ‘gutka’ covers this aspect as well. However, the ban is not being implemented, the lawyer informed the court. 
 
 The   was hearing an application moved by a tobacco manufacturing company seeking to amend its main petition challenging the notification banning ‘gutka’. The court issued notice to the Delhi government and FSSAI seeking their replies before the next date of hearing in the main petition on May 11.
