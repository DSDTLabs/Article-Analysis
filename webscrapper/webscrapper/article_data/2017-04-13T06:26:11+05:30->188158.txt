BENGALURU: To spread the message of social service and upliftment through religion, academician M R   will undertake a bhakti march on foot from Kaiwara in   to Tirupati,  . The march is from April 20 to May 1, to commemorate the birth of seer  .

 The celebrations started in May last year and will conclude with the march. “It is possibly happening for the first time on such a scale. It is the result of 15 years of devotion and hard work. We will be covering a distance of 185 km, crossing 127 villages. With a 1000-member team, we will sing devotional songs along the way. It won't be possible for villagers to join but even if 1520 do, it means we have planted a seed,“ Jayaram said.
 
 The celebration of Ramanuja's birth millennium kicked off last year with ashtakshari namajapa or chanting of shlokas and continued with Sri Ramadandu padayatra and lectures on his philosophy about inclusion of all despite barriers of caste, creed or gender. “We are not seeing this as an event but a movement. We need to bring back ancient teachings and live by them,“ Jayaram said.
