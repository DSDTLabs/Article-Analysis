Coimbatore: Social activists have petitioned the district collector complaining about encroachment on the Noyyal canal in the city.  Activist SP Thiyagarajan said that a private hospital in Peelamedu is constructing a park near the canal, which is against the norms. “It is located near the water body and as per norms, it is illegal,” he said. He also blamed PSG Hospitals for allegedly releasing sewage into the canal. Secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause K Kathirmathiyon said he has received several complaints about the canal’s width getting reduced. “The high court had passed an order that no new constructions will be allowed near water bodies and existing constructions and encroachments had to be removed. While passing the orders, HC had specially recorded and granted one year period – as required by the district collector – to remove all the encroachments in the waterways. The court further ordered that it would monitor the progress. A periodic status report had to be filed showing the compliances along with map of the area and photographs,” he said and added that he would file another contempt of court petition before HC. Meanwhile, city corporation officials denied granting permission for the work. The hospital authorities could not be contacted. TNN
