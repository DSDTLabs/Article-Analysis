Rajkot: For Hirji Bhinradia and his wife Godavari from Malpara village of Gadhada taluka of Botad, their visit to the Agriculture Fair in Israel in 2015 was a life-changing experience. Not only were they able to double the yield from their 40-hectare farm, but their experience has also helped 100 other farmers from the nearby village to increase their output.

 Coming from a water-starved district of Botad, Hirji was open to adopt new technology that could increase his production. He went to Israel Agri Fare on his own expense in 2015 after failing to go there in 2012.
 
 “Our land is not favourable for crop cultivation. We wanted some kind of technology that could make the land more cultivable,” said Hirji. 
 
 Both Hirji and his wife Godavari have 40-hectare land where they now cultivate dates, chikku, gooseberry, watermelon and pear using the Israeli technology. “We learnt from Israeli farmers not to allow climbers to grow much. We experimented with their methods and it gave us better results. Doubled yield.”
 
 Hirji and his wife are now sharing their experience with other farmers. They have formed a small group of 100 farmers from nearby villages. On the last Wednesday of every month they meet and share new methods. 
 
 “Many villagers in Gadhda and Sihor taluka of Botad have adopted the nethouse and greenhouse method of Israel. It protects trees in adverse climate like wind and cold. Simultaneously, it protects trees from diseases,” said Hirji.
 
 “The farmers here have started using drip irrigation system long ago, but haven’t been able to use it in the same way that their Israeli counterparts do. In Israel, farmers give water inside the land to the roots of the trees but it can’t be possible in India,” Hirji added.
