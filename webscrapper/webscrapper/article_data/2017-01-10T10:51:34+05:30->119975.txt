PANAJI: Having found land to construct its   after waiting for six-and-a-half agonizing years, the National Institute of Technology, Goa will now have to hold on till the election process for the state comes to an end to start construction.

  The process of finalizing a plot at Loliem for a permanent campus of the   ( ) will also be on hold till the polling process ends.
 
 The   had started operating from the Farmagudi premises of   (GEC) back in 2010, and the IIT also began functioning from the same premises in July 2016.
 
 Land acquisition for the NIT was completed in March 2016, but with Goa on the brink of elections and a model code of conduct in place, a cabinet meeting to give a final approval to the land handover is unlikely to be held. 
 
 “The earlier approval provided by the state was a mere ‘in principle’ approval. A separate approval is required to give the land to the NIT, free of cost,” a state official informed.
 
 Howver, after the acquisition was completed in March 2016, technical reasons were cited for not handing over the land to the NIT and no mention was made of an approval to waive off the property’s cost. An existing construction in the acquired land was being pointed to as a contentious issue.
 
 With the model code of conduct already in force, the process of finalising the plot in Loliem for the IIT’s permanent campus is also on hold.
 
 Following the dilly-dallies on the NIT land issue, the state was not allowed to make the IIT operational in 2015, until it identified a land for its permanent campus. In 2016, the IIT materialized after Goa was able to satisfy the Union human resource development ministry’s team with the land at Loliem. But villagers have objected to the project saying its details were not being revealed to locals.
