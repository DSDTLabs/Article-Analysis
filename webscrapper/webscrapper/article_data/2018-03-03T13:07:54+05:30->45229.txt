BHUBANESWAR: Alarmed by February 23 explosion of a wedding gift that killed a newlywed man and his grandmother in Patnagarh, the state   on Saturday developed a standard operating procedure, asking courier firms to adopt adequate safety precautions while receiving parcels at their counters. Police are likely to issue an advisory, containing dos and don’ts for recipients, on Saturday evening. Balangir police are yet to make any headway in the   blast case.

 “We have prepared the advisory and strictly asked the courier companies to adopt safety precautions while receiving parcels at their counters before those are despatched. They should install mini-scanner or x-ray machines and metal detectors to scan the goods inside parcels. Unchecked parcels pose danger for both recipients and courier despatchers,” director general of police R P   told TOI.
 
 Police said people should cooperate with the courier companies in carrying out frisking of their parcels. “Courier firms should properly check the identity of senders. They should accept photo identity proofs and phone numbers from senders or their acquaintances, who deposit the parcel in counters on behalf of the real senders,” another police officer said, adding “courier firms should install   cameras where faces of all visitors in their counters can be visible clearly.”
 
 Police said people, while receiving parcels, are supposed to follow a set of precautions. First, they should immediately not open the parcel. “If the recipients are expecting or waiting for parcels from someone they know, there is no harm in opening such parcels. Recipients should always look for details of the sender on parcel. If the sender is a stranger, they should avoid the parcel from anonymous sender,” the police officer said.
 
 At times, miscreants may write down names of known persons of recipients on parcels. In such cases, recipients should call up the senders for verification, police said.
