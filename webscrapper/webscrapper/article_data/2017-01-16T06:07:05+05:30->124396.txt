AHMEDABAD: ‘Kaipo che’ and ‘Lapet’ reverberated from every nook and corner of the city on Saturday as Ahmedabad marked Uttarayan on terraces with pomp and fervour. Wind played a crucial role in the celebration as only the late afternoon and evening of Saturday provided conditions suited best for the aerial warfare of fighter kites. Strong and cold wind kept many indoors for much of Saturday morning. Insufficient wind was reported on Sunday, resulting in increased efforts from die-hard kite enthusiasts who decided to make the most of extended festivities.

 “This is a festival I always look forward to because of the sheer confluence of so many factors,” said  , a resident of Satellite. “We spend almost the entire day on terraces, paying our respect to the Sun god, enjoy food such as undhiyu and jalebi along with chikki and seasonal fruits.” Another highlight, Desai said, was spending time with near and dear ones that greatly increased the revelry and friendly competition. “And above all, showing skills with kites and experiencing joy when our kite emerges victorious after a fierce fight,” Desai said. Lure of festivities brought many to the walled city of Ahmedabad. While Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani tried his hand at kite-flying in Khadia on Saturday, BJP president   visited   on Sunday. A number of NRIs and foreign nationals were also seen on the terraces of walled city areas enjoying the mood.
