KOLKATA: A clash between two syndicate groups, both supporters of the ruling party, at   in   on Monday night turned violent as three houses were vandalised and its occupants roughed up.

 The clash was reportedly the fallout of a previous argument where both groups wanted to control contract labourers and the employees’ association of the Kolkata Regional Transport Authority branch in Kasba. Several families of Naskarpara work with the authority.
 
 The competition had become intense with various stakeholders demanding their share of the pie. This was the third clash in the last three months between the groups — one aligned to local councillor   and the other to MLA Jawed Khan, said a source.
 
 “Late on Monday evening, supporters of   felt humiliated after an argument over employment at the authority, so they damaged the homes of Khan’s supporters asking its occupants to leave,” said a police officer.
 
 “They repeatedly kicked my son and beat me up too after breaking the door. When I asked why they attacked us, they said we must not do business with Khan,” said  , a victim.
 
 Those who were attacked, though, retaliated an hour later by vandalizing the house of a person considered close to Ghosh. 
 
 “An FIR and a counter-FIR has been lodged. We cannot comment on this at this moment,” a senior officer of Lalbazar said.
