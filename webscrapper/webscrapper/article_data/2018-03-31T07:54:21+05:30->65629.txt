Singer   says her new album ' ' is more about accepting herself.

 The hitmaker insists her new LP 'Golden' isn't a   album but instead is about learning to live herself and accepting herself for who she is.
 Speaking about it at an interview, the singer said,"I love singing those lyrics. I probably could not have sung them at the beginning of the year but certainly, once I was feeling great, I was so happy to sing them. 
  
  
 "It was just taking a very honest look at where I am in my life. I'm definitely not alone. People understand. That's part of life. People want to simplify it and say it's a heartbreak album, it's actually not. There's some songs about that but I think it's about acceptance of yourself. That to me is what the strongest emotion is," she added.
