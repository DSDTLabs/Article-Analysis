 A car sporting an   in  , with `zila mukhya nirikshak` (Maulik Adhikaar Association) written on it (see inset pic), arrived at the spot where   have been put up to  .Instead of asking the driver to turn back and issuing a challan for illegal name plate, traffic cops opened the barricades and allowed the car to pass through.
 
 Later, TOI found out that the car (Maruti Alto UP32-CT2954) is registered in the name of Raj Singh.
 
 Such violations make a mockery of traffic rules, more so when they are done by the men in uniform.
 
 As part of the Road Safety Week (January 9-16), traffic police plans to start an awareness drive and crack down on offenders who drive without seat belt, talk on phone while driving or flout the speed limit.
 
 But such campaigns will fail to enlist public support unless traffic police rein-in their own personnel. In this case, action should be taken against the errant cops as well as the car driver to set an example before the public that even men in khaki are not above law.
