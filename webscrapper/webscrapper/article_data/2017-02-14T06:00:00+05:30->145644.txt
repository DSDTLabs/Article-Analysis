Visakhapatnam/Vizianagaram: The massive success of Nandi Natakotsavam reflects the renaissance spirit of the town. 

 The festival drew crowds from districts of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Koraput in Odisha. P Kameswara Rao, lecturer in Telugu from Maharajah’s College Vizianagaram, said, “It is not just the quality of the plays but the mood and enthusiasm of the public that makes this festival truly worth while.” 
 
 On February 13, the three major draws were the plays Yuvanika, Kotha Pravahaalu and Yuga Karthalu. All the three plays are based on social themes and the need for dynamic change. K Jairam, DPRO of Vizianagaram noted, “The fact that social plays are drawing large crowds is a clear indication of the maturity of the audience.”
 
 The festival has augured well for local businesses as well, especially the book stores in the Prince of Wales market. PS Gupta, who owns a book store in the market, said, “A lot of youngsters are suddenly taking interest in the old books published and written by authors of Vizianagaram. This is huge boost to the town.” TNN
