SECUNDERABAD: The government is in a dilemma over the proposed flyovers in Secunderabad cantonment. The idea of flyovers was to provide alternative passage for thousands of commuters once the Army closed the arterial Gough, Wellington and Entrenchment roads passing through the Army Ordnance Corps (AOC) Centre. But after an order from ministry of defence to reopen the closed cantonment roads, some of the roads in Secunderabad cantonment have been reopened. Now that the roads have reopened, the government has kept its proposal to construct two flyovers through the AOC Centre in abeyance. 

 
 Construction of flyovers required lot of money and huge parcels of land belonging to the Defence. Officials said as the AOC roads have been reopened, the state government has for now kept the   proposal on hold.
 
 One flyover was proposed between Safilguda railway junction and Allahabad Gate. The other was between Safilguda railway junction and RK Puram flyover. The proposals were also discussed at length at a high-level meeting under the chairmanship of Telangana chief secretary   with Local Military Authority, SCB officials and  .
 
 About 33 acres of Defence land is needed for the two flyovers. The state government had also held talks with MoD officials seeking Defence land for the flyovers. Though the MoD has issued orders on reopening of roads in Secunderabad Cantonment, the state government is yet to receive a copy of the MoD orders.
 
 In fact, the MoD has given 30 days time to the   to review the reopening of roads. Some roads were opened on May 20. 
 
 "We will wait and see till MoD takes a final decision on the report submitted by the LMA on closure of roads. Anyhow, we need Defence land to implement the proposal. Till then, no activity pertaining to the construction of flyovers will continue," a senior   official told TOI.
