NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday expressed surprise at Delhi police officers acting as special executive magistrates (SEMs) who have allegedly reject bonds arbitrarily to imprison protesters or those facing proceedings for involvement in scuffles. 

 Hearing a PIL by advocate Aldansih Rein complaining about arbitrary exercise of powers by SEMs, a bench headed by Chief Justice   said, "I have been in the legal profession and as a judge for the last 39 years. But I have never found a special executive magistrate rejecting a bond given by a person to keep peace and sending him to jail."
 
 Rein drew the court's attention to an affidavit filed by Delhi police, which informed that 23,140 people were arrested in 2017 under breach of peace provisions of CrPC and as many as 6,879 people were sent to jail. The   said, "There may be some states where SEMs show such hostile attitude." Rein alleged that those sent to jail in this arbitrary manner were also not provided legal aid.
 
 Turning to Delhi police counsel   and Prabhas Bajaj, the CJI said he was adjourning the hearing on the PIL till April 16 to grant an opportunity to Delhi police to mend the process adopted by SEMs.
 
 In its affidavit, Delhi police defended the exercise of power by SEMs and said only assistant commissioners of police were designated as SEMs. 
 
 The apex court was hearing a petition filed by an advocate who alleged that those sent to jail in this arbitrary manner were also not provided legal aid.
