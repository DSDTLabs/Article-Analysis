 But sport persons and office-bearers of various sport association feel that the   (AMC) has been neglecting repair and maintenance work for the past few years. The dressing room in the stadium, seating arrangements, toilets and other facilities are not up to the mark because the municipal body allocates very less fund for the purpose,” said a cricket player on a condition of anonymity. 
 
 He said that the municipal body should strategically develop the facility with an aim to make the stadium good enough for first-class cricket matches. “We do not have air conditioned dressing rooms, cafeteria and other required facilities. The existing seating arrangement is also not up to the mark,” he said. 
 
 Former captain of   district cricket team, Dinesh Khunte, said that the authorities should spend more money. “It is one of the biggest grounds in the city, which has a potential to hold Ranji Trophy matches. But to organise such a prestigious tournament, we need to spend not less that Rs 5 crore per year,” he said. 
 
 Khunte said the stadium that is located in the heart of the city covers a huge area and that it can be developed into a huge cricket stadium. 
 
  member of Maharashtra state sports complex committee also stressed on development of the facility. But, he praised the efforts of the municipal body. “Recently, the municipal authorities have started giving serious thought to development of the stadium. It is a good move on the part of the municipal authorities, but one cannot deny the fact that more funds are required,” he said.
