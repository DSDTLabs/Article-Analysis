PUNE: The 10-km demonstration track for the proposed   open for public scrutiny in just three years. 

 The   (PMRDA) has assured that after the completion of a feasibility study and a detailed project report, people will be able to test the   track by 2021. The feasibility study will commence on March and will be completed in August. A detailed project report ( ) will follow, said   officials.
  
  
 On Sunday, the Richard Branson-led Virgin Group signed a framework agreement with   to build a hyperloop transportation system between Mumbai and Pune. The system is expected to reduce the travel time between the two cities from the current three hours to just about 25 minute. 
 
 PMRDA commissioner Kiran Gitte said by 2021, citizens will be able to check the hyperloop track after all the tests. “PMRDA will be the implementing authority. The pre-feasibility and feasibility studies are expected to be completed in six months, and a detailed project report will follow. By 2021, testing will be done on a 10-km demonstration track,” he said.
 
 PMRDA wil also be helping the Virgin Group in assessing route feasibility, geography, terrain as well as the engineering firms.
 
 “Virgin One has the technology, but it needs to engage engineering firms to implement the technology. Global firms are being considered and local engineering firms will also be roped in,” said Gitte. The pre-feasibility and feasibility reports will be readied by Virgin Hyperloop at a cost of about Rs 10-12 crore. The studies will also help the PMRDA get a thorough understanding of the project, he added.
