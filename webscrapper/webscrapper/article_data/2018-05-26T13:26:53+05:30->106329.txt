JAIPUR: Ugly scenes were witnessed at ‘Mera Booth Mera Gaurav’ (My booth my pride) a programme by the opposition   at   on the outskirts of Jaipur on Friday. Congress workers were involved in violent confrontation with each other. A minor argument turned into an ugly spat where many workers were seen thrashing each other and even national spokesperson of All India Congress Committee (AICC). Though the senior party leaders termed it as a ‘minor confrontation’ it witnessed exchanges of kicks and punches among the party workers.

 According to the sources, the event which is meant to consolidate the party and its workers is being organised across the state at booth level. The event organised at Shahi Bagh garden also saw a good number of Congress workers. In the morning when the event was about to start, suddenly a group of supporters of a leader started raising their voice and showed resentment over some issue which immediately triggered an argument involving other party workers.
 
 Sources said that various leaders came along with their supporters. “It started when group of two senior Congress leaders entered into an argument which ended in violent confrontation,” said a Congress worker present at the spot while talking to TOI on the phone.
 
 Angry workers even pushed national spokesman, Sandeep Chaudhary and there was unconfirmed news that his car was also been damaged.
 
 When contacted, Sachin Pilot, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief, said, “I have just heard about it and have no clear knowledge on what happened exactly.”
