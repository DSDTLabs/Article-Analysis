RANCHI: Citizens can now procure   of a button and need not go all the way to the Ranchi Municipal Corporation’s water board department. The RMC water tanker application was launched on Monday afternoon by State urban development minister C.P. Singh. One can also book the tanker through the RMC website and a toll-free number. However, the application could not be downloaded despite several attempts by this reporter on Monday.

 The price of water tankers has also been increased substantially. Whereas earlier one had to pay Rs 300 for a 2000 litre tank, people would now have to shed Rs 500. Similarly, the price of a Rs 4000 litre tank has now been increased from Rs 600 to Rs 800. The highest one can order is a 9000-capacity tanker for Rs 1500.
 
 Water shortage is a persistent problem in the city every summer and water tankers are on duty all-round day during the hottest days. 
 
 Sanjeev Vijayvargiya, deputy mayor said, “The   is a part of the over hauling of the water distribution system. We observed the system set up in cities like   and Hyderabad where the municipal corporation had outsourced the tankers to private companies. We have done the same and now the private tankers will be available even at night. Only businessmen and others in urgent need will have to dish out the extra money. Common people will continue getting the services as before.”
