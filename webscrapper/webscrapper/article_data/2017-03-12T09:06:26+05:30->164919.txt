CHANDIGARH: While Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) supremo Sukhbir Badal often managed to lure sitting and former MLAs from Opposition camp to his party in the past five years, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday avenged their loss by defeating 10 of SAD's sitting ministers. 

 This included son-in-law of Punjab chief minister and outgoing food minister Adesh Partap Kairon. Kairon was at the centre of Rs 12,000-crore foodgrains scam, which attracted scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).
 
 Kairon, a three-time minister, lost to Congress's Harminder Singh Gill by more than 8,363 votes in Patti. Kairon's grandfather Partap had served as Punjab chief minister in Congress rule.
 
 The other senior Akali ministers who lost include education minister and spokesperson Daljit Cheema, animal husbandry minister Gulzar Singh Ranike, tourism minister Sohan Singh Thandal.
 
 Two of the four BJP ministers, Anil Joshi and Surjit Jyani, who had got tickets lost to Congress Sunil Dutti and Davinder Ghubaya in   and Fazilka. Infact, Ghubaya is a 25-year-old son of sitting rebel Akali Dal MP Sher Singh Ghubaya. The family had openly revolted agaisnt SAD.
 
 In Maur where the IED car blast had triggered a massive war of words between political parties, AAP's Jagdev Singh trumped SAD's Janmeja Singh Sekhon.
 
 Akali Dal also lost their rural development minister Sikander Singh Maluka, who was at the eye of the storm last year over his run-ins with the Punjab Police and distortion of hymns.
 
 One of the biggest losses for the SAD will be that of Tota Singh as he too had courted a row over Rs 39-crore cotton crop scam in 2015 which had led to widespread protests across the state by several farmer unions and religious groups, forcing Railroko abhiyans. There were subsequent suicides after government had failed to provide compensation and debt waivers.
