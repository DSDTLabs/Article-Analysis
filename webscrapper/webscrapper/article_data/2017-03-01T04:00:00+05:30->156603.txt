Mumbai:   has written to markets regulator Sebi, alleging violation of insider trading norms by its former chairman   for disclosing confidential information relating to Tata entities in the petition filed before the National Company Law Tribunal ( ) by his family-owned firms. 

 Mistry’s family-owned firms, which are shareholders of Tata Sons, had moved NCLT against oppression and mismanagement by the holding company of the  . NCLT will announce its order on March 6. 
 
 Tata Sons, in a six-page letter to Sebi’s whole time member S Raman and executive director S Ravindran, said that Mistry had revealed “price-sensitive” information relating to business strategies and financial data of Tata Sons and other Tata companies that is “not relevant to the subject matter of the petition”. 
 
 The letter dated February 24, a copy of which is with TOI, said that Mistry had received information about various Tata companies including that of the listed  , Indian Hotels,  , Titan and Tata Power as a director and executive chairman of Tata Sons and the same was passed on to his family-owned firms. 
 
 By passing on sensitive information to companies owned by Mistry’s family, he had violated confidential obligations, his fiduciary duties as a director and Sebi’s insider trading norms, said the Tata Sons letter signed by its in-house general counsel Bharat Vasani. 
 
 While acting through the petitioners (Mistry’s family-owned firms), Mistry may have wanted to rely on certain documents for agitating certain issues against Tata Sons, but he has acted in complete breach of his legal obligations, when he caused the petitioners to deliberately annex the entire minutes of the board meetings without redacting irrelevant portions of it that are unrelated to the matters averred in the petition and that contained unpublished price-sensitive information relating to listed Tata entities, the letter said. Tata Sons said that Mistry’s “reckless” action has caused damages to Tata Sons and the shareholders of other Tata companies.
