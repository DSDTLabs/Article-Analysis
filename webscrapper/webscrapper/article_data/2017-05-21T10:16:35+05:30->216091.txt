CHANDIGARH: Members of  's Chandigarh unit on Saturday sought the intervention of the central government on numerous issues of the city during their interaction with the party's national president  . Among those who attended the meeting were local leaders, councillors and workers. They told Shah that many of these issues had been lingering for years and residents have been asking for them to be resolved. 

 Sources said many of these issues have been raised again and again during election rallies, whether it is   or the municipal corporation polls. 
 
 However, most of these have remained unresolved. 
 
 With Lok Sabha elections two years away, the leaders want that key issues are taken up in Delhi so that they don't have to face the public's ire.
