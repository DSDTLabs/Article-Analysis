Just a day into its big release, Balakrishna’s ‘Gautamiputra Satakarni’ has been getting rave reviews from fans and celebrities alike. The film has found a fan in Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu, who has joined the chorus to sing praises of the historical drama.
 
Impressed with director Krish’s latest venture, the CM took to Twitter to congratulate the team and praise their efforts saying, "Congrats to @DirKrish, Balakrishna garu, @shriya1109 & the crew of #GautamiPutraSatakarni for bringing the history of #Amaravati alive. Splendid performance and great presentation of original content; this movie will be the pride of Telugus.” 
 
 
 
He also posted a few pictures of himself catching a special screening of the movie along with Balayya, Shriya Saran and director Krish. It must be noted that the veteran actor is also a member of Telugu Desam Party, of which Mr Naidu is the president. 
 
Now this surely makes Balayya's hundredth film extra special.
