After a successful run of three years and having been a TRP-topper for most of it, Kumkum Bhagya is set for another milestone. Taking cue from the success of the   spin-off Dil Boley Oberoi (which was launched in February 2017 and was the first Hindi daily soap to have its own spin-off) on a rival channel, the KKB showmakers now want to give their loyal viewers more.
 
  
 
  
  While the parent show reportedly will continue to focus on the love story between Abhi (Shabbir Ahluwalia) and Pragya ( ) and keep viewers glued with the various dramatic twists and turns, the spin-off will look at Pragya's back story.
  
  According to a industry source, the spin-off will revolve around Pragya's family and will also give an insight on what happened to her father.
