KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Friday summoned the registrar of the West Bengal Medical Council (WBMC) to explain why it is delaying in submitting a probe report against a doctor accused of negligence that allegedly resulted in the death of 37-year-old in 2014. Neil   returned to Kolkata after his studies in Scotland and was planning to open a resort in Goa when he was diagnosed with dengue and admitted to a hospital in Garcha. 

 According to a petition moved by Neil’s mother Jharna Ghosh, that despite knowing that her son was a diabetic, the doctor administered intravenous glucose. On November 3, 2014, when Neil’s creatinine level rose to 8.5, the doctor attempted dialysis but the patient went into coma. Neil was then moved to another private hospital in south Kolkata where he passed away on November 16. Ghosh sought the state government’s intervention, and finally moved the high court in 2017.
 
 The WBMC told her that the doctor was not its member. The   (MCI), however, said the WBMC would have to look into the issue. When the matter came up for hearing on March 28, Justice   directed WBMC to treat the doctor as a member and hand over a probe report to the state. The state health department was also directed to investigate.
 
 On Friday, when Ghosh reached court with her counsel Biswaroop Bhattacharya and Devajyoti Bhattacharya, the WBMC submitted that it wasn’t possible for them to take action against the doctor. 
 
 The court expressed displeasure and wanted to know why a report has not been submitted to the state. It then summoned the WBMC registrar, who appeared and submitted a report.
