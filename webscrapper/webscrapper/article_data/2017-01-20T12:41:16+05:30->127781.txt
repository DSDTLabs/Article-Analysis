NEW DELHI:  , the first state to unconditionally accept the   even before   verdict, will be hosting the two U-19 'Test' matches between India and England after   (TNCA) refusal.

 The two four-day 'Tests' will be held on February 13-16 and 21-24. The matches were originally awarded to TNCA, which had two weeks back written to   that they won't be able to host the Tests.
 
 While TNCA's official reason is completion of already delayed league, many saw their refusal as an act of non co-operation after the Supreme Court verdict on January 2 and 3 made most of the state association office-bearers ineligible.
 
 The VCA, which has two grounds and was once headed by the now ICC chairman  , were first to accept reforms and they have now come to BCCI's rescue after Mumbai Cricket Association, which will host all five ODIs -- 3 at Wankhede Stadium and 2 at the Brabourne.
 
 Meanwhile, the BCCI also selected 20-member India U-19 squad for the five 'Youth' one-day matches against England.
 
 It has been learnt that coach   wants to watch as many youngsters as possible going into the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand in 2018.
 
 The squad comprises of most members of the Asia Cup U-19 winning team including teen sensation Prithvi Shaw, Abhishek Sharma and Shubhman Gill.
 
 Bengal's Ishan Porel, one of the fastest bowlers at the colts level has also been included.
 
 India Under 19 for one-dayers: Heramb Parab, Het Patel, Himanshu Rana, Ayush Jamwal, Vivekanand Tiwary, Prithvi Shaw, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Harvik Desai, Rahul Desraj Chahar, Kamlesh Singh Nagarkoti, Salman Khan, Priyam Garg, Shiva Singh, Yash Thakur, Mayank Rawat, Rohan Kunnumal, Ishan Porel.
