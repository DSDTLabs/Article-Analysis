NEW DELHI: The strenuous objections by the   to the dropping of certain paragraphs in the more than 24-year-old pending reports of the comptroller and auditor general saw the   agreeing to share detailed file notings with regard to the   pay off case.

 The   ministry recommendation that certain paras in the Bofors report be dropped as relevant files are no longer available caught the attention of a sub-committee of the   examining long pending reports, including the ones dealing with the Bofors acquisition and corruption allegations.
 
  MP   forcefully raised the issue at a recent meeting of the PAC subcommittee when he asked the defence officials to share all file details regarding acquisition of the Bofors howitzer.
 
 Dubey demanded that all deliberations and minutes along with the MOD files be made available for scrutiny to see whether the recommendation to drop the audit paras was justified.
 
 BJD leader   is understood to have drawn attention to the previous defence ministry comment that “presently the uploading of audit para on portal is being done by the monitoring cell, which sometimes uploads even those paras on which ministry/ department does not need submit ATNs, such as introduction paras, paras stating facts, etc. This leads to discrepancy in the pendency list of paras.”
 
 Mahtab said that in the previous committee members were taken aback when this letter was brought to the panel’s notice.
 
 “If the defence ministry will say that because certain files are not available, let us drop these paragraphs and that too justifying it, saying that it is already 25 years old...The task that has been entrusted is to go into those pending paragraphs only with the civil ministries we deal with,” he is understood to have commented.
 
 The discussion on the subject concluded with Mahtab noting that the defence secretary had agreed to share all the relevant files with the MOD.
