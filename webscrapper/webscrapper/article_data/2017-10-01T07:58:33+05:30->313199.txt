 The incessant rains or soaring temperatures, nothing can dull the spirits of the Fresh Face aspirants. The Oppo Times Fresh Face 2017 held its open session auditions at DLF Promenade. A sizable number of freshers from across NCR turned up to try their luck in the competition.

  
  WINNER: Anmol Kapoor
 
 
  
  Emcee   and DJ   got the ball rolling, as they kept the crowd and participants engaged and interested. The participants underwent three rounds of competition - introduction, talent, and Q&A - wherein the freshers danced, walked the ramp, and even did pushups on the stage. Not just the freshers, but even the celebrity judge - actor   - enjoyed the auditions. "I'm amazed by the dedication of these kids. Their performance shows how badly they want this," said Samarth. Following the three rounds, Anmol Kapoor of Aurobindo College was declared the winner.
