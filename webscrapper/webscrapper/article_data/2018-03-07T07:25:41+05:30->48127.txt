BENGALURU: Retired director general of police (prisons) H N   has moved the high court, challenging a February 26, 2018 government order asking the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ) to register a case against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. 

 The ACB has been asked to probe the allegation made last year by then DIG (prisons) D Roopa that Rao was party to the Rs 2 crore-bribe paid to extend undue favours to AIADMK V K   who is serving a four-year term in Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara.
 
 Justice Vineet Kothari heard the matter on Tuesday and directed the petitioner to place before the court by next week copies of the inquiry report submitted by retired IAS officer Vinay Kumar in the matter and the FIR copy.
 
  The petitioner's counsel submitted a statement given by Rao before the inquiry officer on July 25, 2017 that he had only complied with directions of the chief minister with regard to Sasikala. According to him, two representations submitted seeking class-I facility for Sasikala were rejected citing order no. 459 of the Karnataka Prison Manual, and she had been lodged in the first floor of the women's enclosure. 
 
 "After a month, the chief minister had called me to the guesthouse and enquired about the facility given to Sasikala. I told him that Sasikala was being treated like any other woman prisoner. The CM instructed me to provide only a cot, bed and pillow which I complied with, because the government has absolute power in this regard. Anitha, superintendent of prison, who was in charge of the security of Sasikala, was instructed to submit daily reports. She hasn't mentioned any security lapse or complaints in her reports," Rao
 
  Sasi down with fever 
 
  Sasikala, meanwhile, took ill on Tuesday evening. According to prison sources, she went to the prison hospital around 6.30pm complaining of mild fever, and doctors advised rest. Skipping dinner, Sasikala had bread, biscuits and hot milk before retiring to her cell.
