ALLAHABAD: A senior member of Margdarshak Mandal, the highest decision-making body of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), said on Saturday that VHP's international working president Praveen   would be removed from his post for making remarks against the Central and Rajasthan governments. 

  But some leaders who came to attend the Sant Sammelan voiced support for the VHP stalwart. Togadia, who had gone "missing" for several hours on Monday and was hospitalised subsequently, had alleged that he had information that the Rajasthan police were coming for his "encounter" and that the Intelligence Bureau was behind the police cases against him. "Togadia has indulged in indiscipline and he will be shown the door," said senior VHP leader Swami Chinmayanand. TOI had reported earlier that RSS was planning to axe Togadia for his confrontational approach against the Centre. 
 
  The Margdarshak Mandal member said Togadia had lost his importance in the VHP. "Most people in the organisation are happy that he has been sidelined. His recent act is a proof of his indiscipline. He won't be tolerated in VHP anymore," he said. Claiming that his stand reflected the general opinion in the Margdarshak Mandal, Chinmayanand said, "Togadia has no relations with VHP now." 
 
  VHP general secretary Champat Rai said, "Who says Togadia ji has been sidelined by VHP. He is dear to us and to the society."
