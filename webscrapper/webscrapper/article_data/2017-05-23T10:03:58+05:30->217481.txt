PANAJI: Chief minister Manohar   on Monday, directed the Public Works Department (PWD) to inspect the stability of all old bridges including those not in use and do   audit reports, which should be submitted by June 30. The report should also include measures for rehabilitation of old bridges.

 The direction comes after the recent collapse of Sanvordem footbridge, where two people lost their lives.
 
 “As a measure of public safety, in the first instance and on an urgent basis, all old unused bridges are required to be barricaded and access to all sides need to be blocked with appropriate measures, and status report on the measures taken should be submitted by May 31, to the CM’s office,” said Parrikar.
 
 He said, “All such old bridges, whether in use or not, shall be inspected for its stability and safety and such   reports shall be submitted to the CM’s office by June 30, 2017, along with measures for rehabilitation.”
 
 TOI was first to report that the PWD is waiting for financial approval of the government to conduct safety audit of all roads and bridges in the state. 
 
 Two companies had bid for the audit. Pune-based ARAI and New York-based HAKS have made their bids, with HAKS putting forward the lowest bid. Once selected, the company will have to complete the audit within a year.
 
 Last week, PWD remained confident about the structural strength of Goan bridges and had said that the department conducted safety audits of all the bridges twice a year. With monsoons around the corner, the department said it would commence its safety checks in the coming days for critical bridges in Goa. Elaborating on the safety checks, PWD officials said that the inspection checks the deck slab levels, corrosion and other changes in the   conditions.
