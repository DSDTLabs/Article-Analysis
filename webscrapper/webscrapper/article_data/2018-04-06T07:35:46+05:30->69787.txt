PATNA: Rain lashed several north   districts on Thursday morning, signalling return of pre-monsoon showers in the region after a gap of five days.

 According to the Patna Meteorological Centre, Forbesganj received 36.3mm rainfall till 8.30am followed by   (12.6mm), Darbhanga (3.2mm) and Supaul (2.5mm) on Thursday.

 The showers were attributed to a north-south trough along with a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and adjoining  . A trough is basically an area of low pressure along a particular axis, which leads to showers.

 On the nature of the expected showers in the region, the IMD weather bulletin said scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm or squall or hailstorm were likely over parts of east and northeast India from April 5 to 7.
