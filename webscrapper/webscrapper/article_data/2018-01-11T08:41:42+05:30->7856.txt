While the majority of them pertained to disputes between neighbouring families, domestic violence accounted for the second most common complaint.
 
 Additional director general Aditya Mishra, who heads the facility, said, “This comes even as we were under the impression that murder, robbery and crimes against women and other criminal offences are key policing areas.

 The analysis revealed that nuisance of noise pollution peaks in November and December, the two months when wedding processions are largely held. State radio officer of UP-100 Raghavendra Dwivedi said, “On expected lines, nuisance caused by baraat processions and DJ goes up in the two months. Onethird of the total complaints were received in November and December with significant number of calls on December 25 and December 31.”
 
 The highest number of noise pollution-related complaints originated from Lucknow.
 
 On the annual day of UP-100, Mishra also gave a special reward to Harvinder Singh, who had alerted the police control room about broken railway tracks last year.
