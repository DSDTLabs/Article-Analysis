CHENNAI: Several residents of Nanganallur have renewed their long-standing demand that the state government set up an arts college in the area. Students, particularly women, now were forced to commute long distances by train and bus, they complained. 

 V Rama Rao of the Public Awareness Association said the vast space at Government Nehru Higher Secondary School in Pazhavanthangal, close to Nanganallur, could be used to set up a college like the one in R K Nagar. "Thousands of students in Nanganallur and surrounding areas like Alandur, Pazavanthangal, Kilakattalai, Ullagaram, Puzuthivakkam, Nanmangalam and Kovilambakkam will benefit," he said.
 
 S Choodamani, who lives in Nanganallur, said the demand had been ignored for more than 20 years by the authorities. "It is sad to see girl students struggle in packed trains and buses in the morning as they commute to colleges in distant places," she said.
 
 P Satyanarayana, another resident of the area, said setting up a college in the area could help reduce congestion on suburban trains and buses.
 
 Rama Rao, a civic activist who has spearheaded many agitations demanding proper amenities in the area, said repeated representations by residents and civic associations to the authorities concerned, including the state education department, over the years had fallen on deaf ears. "We hope the new government that is scheduled to be sworn in soon, will resolve this long-pending problem," he said.
