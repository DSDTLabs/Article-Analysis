Designer Namrata Joshipura showcased her Autumn Winter 17 collection at Amazon India Fashion in association with Maybelline New York on Friday. This time, she collaborated with the beauty brand Maybelline and her collection was in sync with drama and trends from New York. 

 For the Maybelline show, Bollywood actor   turned out to be the perfect muse for the designer. She was seen walking the ramp in a green jumpsuit with fringes. She sashayed down the ramp to funky beats and stole everyone’s heart at the show. 
 
 Alia Bhatt, who’s also the brand ambassador for Maybelline New York walked for the first time for Maybelline. She oozed glamour in one shoulder sequined jumpsuit, while the crowd kept hooting for her never-seen-before avatar.
  
  
 ‘’One word I would use for today’s look is drama. We have kept it very dramatic; you can see with the eye make-up, hair and even with Namrata’s outfit. The outfit is actually very comfortable for a showstopper to walk, but at the same time, it has all the drama with the fringes, sequins, and slits. I feel it’s very-very wearable!’’ said Alia Bhatt in a conversation with FDCI.
