Tirupur: National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), Delhi, has withdrawn its objection over Tirupur’s NIFT-TEA college of knitwear fashion using the abbreviation — NIFT. 
 
 When NIFT-TEA was established by the Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA) in 1997, it was run with the support of NIFT, the central government fashion institution which has 17 branches across the country. Later, NIFT-TEA had affiliated with Alagappa University and then with Bharathiyar university. Since many institutions have started using the abbreviation in their names without an approval of NIFT, it had raised objections against them, including NIFT-TEA, and moved the court on the issue. 
  
 “We explained that NIFT-TEA focuses on knitwear fashion education unlike NIFT colleges, whose areas of study were vast,” said T R Vijayakumar, general secretary of TEA, and added that, “The Delhi institution has accepted their argument and told our college need not to change its name.” tnn
