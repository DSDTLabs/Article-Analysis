PUNE: The state   has opened its doors to all   and   leaders, saying those who feel Prime Minister   is the future of the nation are welcome to the fold.

 Chandrakant Patil, the state revenue minister and a close aide of BJP national president Amit Shah, is on the mission to ensure “Congress Mukta” Maharashtra. He told TOI, “If someone is influenced by Prime Minister Modi’s leadership and believes he will be the face of development for the next 10 years, we shall always welcome him/her.”
 
 When asked if the party has any specific strategy to attract Congress and NCP stalwarts in Maharashtra, Patil said, “We shall not say no to anyone who believes in Modi’s leadership.”
 
 Commenting on the political buzz that former chief minister and Congress leader Narayan Rane could join the BJP, Patil said, “I don’t know if Rane will join the BJP. He is such a leader that any party will welcome him.”
 
 Political circles were abuzz over the past few days with talks that along with Rane, Sharad Pawar’s close confidant and former finance minister Jayant Patil, NCP’s Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale and many other prominent Congress and NCP leaders are in touch with the BJP leadership. But these leaders ruled out any such possibility and vouched loyalty to their respective parties.
 
 Chandrakant Patil, holding the number two position in the state cabinet, is also close to RSS leaders and a major player in the state BJP. Party sources stated that Patil was shouldering the task of ensuring that the BJP had enough support within and outside the Assembly if at all Shiv Sena decided to withdraw its support.
