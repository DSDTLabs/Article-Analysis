Virat Kohli the Indian skipper is bang on target when he says the Indian team has played only up to 80 percent of their potential and will strive to get that as close to 100 percent as quickly as possible.

 
 That’s an exciting prospect as what was seen in South Africa especially in the limited over series was a unit that believed in itself, combined brilliantly in all departments of the game and when required raised the level of their game that the other team failed to match up to. The top four batsmen batted with so much class that the lower order was hardly needed. The opening bowlers choked the runs up at the start of the Proteas innings and then towards the end too. If the South African batsmen thought they could break free in the middle-overs, they were in for a surprise as the two wrist spinners, Chahal and Kuldeep made them play the wrong line and made them look like schoolboy cricketers. These two, with their guile and more importantly big heart and super confidence, are going to win many more games for India and not just with the white ball but the red ball too.
 
  
 The only blip on the radar was the Test series loss, but here too the Indian team was in the contest for three innings of both those Tests and lost in the fourth as they didn't get the start they needed and the solidity of the middle-order was missing with Rahane’s absence. Kohli’s failures in those two last outings also made a huge difference for he was way above everybody else. It was like being in an elevator with some rugby players like I experienced in Johannesburg, so gigantic was the difference in ability and temperament between the Indian captain and the other 21 players on the field.
