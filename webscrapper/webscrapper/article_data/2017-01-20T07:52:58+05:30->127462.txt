THALASSERY: Police have taken five   from Dharmadom and nearby places into custody for the murder of BJP activist   at Andaloor near here on Wednesday night. A police team led by DSP (Thalassery) Prince Abraham is interrogating them but it refused to confirm detaining them. 

 Police said assailants had barged into Santhosh's house around 11pm when he was alone and hacked him. 
 
 Santhosh's friends had taken him to hospital but he died on the way due to profuse bleeding. Andaloor is part of Dharmadom assembly constituency, represented by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
 
 There were clashes between SFI and   at Government Brennen College, Dharmadom, during Vivekananda Jayanthi celebrations a few days ago. Santhosh was the BJP candidate in Andaloor ward in the last local body election.
