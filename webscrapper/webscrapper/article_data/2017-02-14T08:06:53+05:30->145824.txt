SEHRUA, LAKHIMPUR-KHERI: Since Independence, women of   village under Mitauli tehsil have not voted. The age old tradition of purdah (veil) was followed religiously for 68 years before things began to change. It was in 2014 that women queued up for the first time at the local booth to cast vote.Now a woman heads the village with a population of about 1,800 people, majority being Muslims.

 On Monday noon, as political campaigning came to an end 48 hours before polls, along with her husband Hasibullah, Aisha is out to convince people who is their best bet for 2017 assembly elections. Villagers are tasked with the responsibility to elect   on February 15 and political chats are growing louder. In the fields adjoining the khadanja (brick road) to the village, females can be seen working in courtyards. “Operating chaff cutter machines is the most popular chore among women here,“ shares  , a man in his early 60s. Youth and men are also out to support their candidates.
 
 The elderly man insists male members never issued diktats for women to stay indoors. “You can see if things have improved. Womenfolk used to follow the old tradition of their own accord,“ adds Azizullah.
