Having acted in two successful films together '   and  , the lead pair   and   teamed up for the third time for  , produced by   under MVV Cinema. So, the expectations were naturally high. Looks like the lead pair are pretty pleased with the audience response to the film. 'I've been hearing really good things about the film. This has to be our third hit together,' declares Hansika right at the outset even as Vishnu nods in agreement.
Ask them what is the secret behind their success, and Hansika butts in saying, 'We are like Tom and Jerry on the sets.' To which Vishnu says, 'Oh, we are always pulling pranks at each other. But she's extremely sportive and a lot of fun to work with. There's always a positive vibe to be working with her.' 
 Incidentally, her character in the film is very similar to her off-screen persona admits Hansika. 'My character   is a lot like me. As the name suggests, I'm the one who motivates Lucky (Vishnu) to not lose hope, although he believes that he has the worst luck in the world,' she says.
 So does that mean Hansika was the lucky mascot for the film? Before Hansika can answer Vishnu butts in saying, 'Sure she's got me as her boyfriend!' Hansika scoffs and retorts, 'Oh you wish!' 'His kids call me maasi,' she tells us.
