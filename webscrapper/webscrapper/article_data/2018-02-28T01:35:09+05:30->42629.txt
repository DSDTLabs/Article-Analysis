NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday alleged that the “physical assault” on environment minister   in the secretariat was “pre-meditated” and the result of a “conspiracy” hatched at Raj Niwas by LG Anil Baijal, chief secretary Anshu Prakash and the IAS Association. 

 The party claimed that the “conspiracy” was a fallout of the alleged   on the chief secretary at CM’s residence. The motive, it said, was to destabilise the   government.
 
 “From CM’s residence, CS directly went to LG’s house on Monday night where a meeting was held. CS, LG and Delhi police commissioner were present (at the meet),” AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj claimed at a press conference.
 
 He claimed a meeting of the IAS Association was held at the secretariat on Tuesday. “At the meeting, the officers and employees were provoked and given the go-ahead to   the ministers and their associates. They were assured that no action would be taken against them because the police and the Centre will support them,” Bharadwaj alleged. 
 
 AAP functionary Dilip Pandey asked why LG, CS and officials of IAS Association should not be booked for criminal conspiracy.
 
 LG’s office didn’t react to the charges.
