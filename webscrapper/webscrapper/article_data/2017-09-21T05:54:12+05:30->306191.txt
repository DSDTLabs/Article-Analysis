AHMEDABAD: Four companies have been finalized to provide 500MW   to   (GUVNL) through reverse  . These companies, which have emerged as winners, are  ,   (India) Pvt Ltd, Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Limited (GSECL) and Gujarat Industries Power Company Ltd (GIPCL).

 In June this year, GUVNL had floated a tender for procuring 500MW each from solar power projects through competitive bidding. The reverse e-auction was recently completed.
 
 Azure Power quoted Rs2.67 per unit for 260MW and GRT Jewellers Rs2.65 a unit for 90MW. GSECL and GIPCL tariffs were Rs2.66 and Rs2.67 respectively for 75MW each.
 
 The lowest tariff of Rs. 2.65 a unit discovered through the competitive bidding is tad higher than the previous rate of Rs. 2.44 per unit discovered in Rajasthan.
 
 “The increase is on account of goods and services tax (GST) as well as rise in cost of solar power panels. Also, GUVNL discovered tariffs are inclusive of GST, while developers in Rajasthan has to pay GST over and above the agreed tariffs,” said sources close to the development.
 
 GUVNL will now sing power purchase agreements with the successful bidders, who are required to start supply within 18 months.
 
 The state-run utility had also issued a separate tender to procure 500MW from wind power projects. However, the process has been delayed as the Central government is yet to come out with guidelines for competitive bidding in wind power projects. For solar projects, guidelines were not issues, hence, the bidding was completed and winners finalized,” said sources.
