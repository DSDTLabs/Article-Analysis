BENGALURU: The party-hopping of   leaders continued on Thursday with former minister   and former Bhatkal MLA   officially joining the saffron party. 

 Sources said Kumar will again contest against his brother Madhu Bangarappa of the JD(S) in Sorab constituency, once represented by their late father and former chief minister S Bangarappa in the 2018 assembly polls. H Halappa, who unsuccessfully contested against Madhu on a KJP ticket in 2013, has been asked to scout for a new constituency. 
 
  After joining the party in the presence of   state president B S Yeddyurappa, Kumar said he harboured deep discontent against the Congress. He joined the BJP as he was impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's style of functioning and Yeddyurappa's leadership in the state, he said.
