AGARTALA: An average of 17   had been   every month in   last year,   revealed in the   on Friday. 

 He, however, claimed that the situation had improved from that in 2015, when 18 women had been harassed every month on an average, and that in 2014, when the average figure was 21.
 
 Sarkar said a total of 207 women had been assaulted in 2016, 213 in 2015 and 246 the year before. He added that police alone could not stop such cases from taking place unless society as a whole took it upon itself to change. Such atrocities were a social evil and had to be countered by social units like the family and stakeholders like NGOs, clubs and political parties, he said.
 
 Opposition Congress and Trinamool Congress, however, criticized the ruling party and accused Sarkar of not taking responsibility for rising crimes against women.
 
 "These crimes happen only when criminals get shelter from the party in power and police don't act upon complaints. Moreover, in most cases, the accused had links with CPM," Congress MLA Ratan Lal Nath alleged.
