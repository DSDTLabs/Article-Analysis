 has always been known to attract celebrities, be it   actors or cricketing legends. The latest to have made a starry appearance in   is cricketing ace  .

The cricketer is known to have close ties with the bride’s family as her father owns a popular institution and has connections with the sporting field, too. The wedding was attended by over 10,000 guests, but it was the ‘Turbanator’ who stole the show with his presence. Togged in a blue blazer and yellow turban, he was the cynosure of all eyes. And need we add that he was truly blown away by the hospitality rendered by Kudlaites.
