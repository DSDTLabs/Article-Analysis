PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: With the   (PCMC) beginning work on two internal roads,   residents’ effort finally seems to have borne fruit. The roads will connect areas within Ravet and reduce congestion on the   BRT route. 
 
 Ravet village is well-connected with various parts of Pimpri Chinchwad and has witnessed rapid development in the past two decades. 
  
 As per the development plan, a 24-metre-wide road is to be constructed to link the housing project Celestial City to the Sangvi-Kiwale BRT road. The road going to SB Patil School has not been developed due to the farmers’ reluctance to give their land to construct the road. 
  
 Local resident Prajakta Rudrawar said, “The builder had constructed a road linking Celestial City to the BRT route. But, in June 2014, the builder closed the road and provided the kutcha road instead. That’s when we started our struggle to convince PCMC to construct the 24-meter DP road at the earliest.”
