 “Ever since the Supreme Court verdict of November 11, 2016 upholding the Allahabad high court order of October 26, 2016 for a  , the maintenance of the said road has stopped as NTBCL, which is the main company responsible for the maintenance of the road, is not doing the same. Because of this, there is no regular cleaning, lighting, upkeep of plants and daily maintenance of the road. Also, there’s a need to increase police patrolling as well as deployment of fire tenders and ambulances to tend to emergencies,” said P S Jain, president, CONRWA.
 
 According to Jain, since the possession of the road is with NTBCL, it is the responsibility of the company to maintain it. “But there’s no maintenance happening on the road,” said Jain. 
 
 Since one portion of the road is under the ownership and control of Noida Authority and the other major part is under Delhi government, the two have a joint responsibility, according to Jain. 
 
 Anil Sharma, general secretary, CONRWA said that the concerned officers from Delhi should also be asked to take care of the area falling under Delhi government.
