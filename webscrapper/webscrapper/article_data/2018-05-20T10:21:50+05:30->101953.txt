INDORE: Learning lessons from the past,   conducted three dry runs across all the 23 centres just two days ahead of Common Entrance Test ( ) on Saturday.

 "Last year it was the first time when the CET exam was conducted online and we had done only one   so there were certain shortcomings that we had to face. This time we wanted to ensure that there are no loopholes," said CET chairman Dr   adding that the dry runs were done by the agency hired for conducting the exam for the university.
 
 Speaking about the observers, DAVV media in charge Chandan   said that the professors of the university have been appointed as observers across all the city-based centres, whereas the other cities will have the local professors as observers.
 
 Over 8979 students will be giving the exam in the morning shift and 8217 students will appear in the exam in the afternoon. This year Dewas has been added as a new centre for the exam, therefore, from this year the exam will be conducted in 27 cities. â€œWe have increased the number of seats as well this time. Last year there were 2100 seats, but, this time there are 2630 seats," said Gupta.
 
 In the group A, 1140 seats are available, whereas group B will have 990 seats. While group C has 270 seats, group D has over 230 seats. This year edit option was available for the students who in case of any wrong information were able to edit it. The technical teams that are set for all the centres have done the verification from their end. "This is the first time when the university ensured calling those candidates, who either didn't pay the fee, or had incomplete information before the last day so that they could do the needful," added Gupta.
