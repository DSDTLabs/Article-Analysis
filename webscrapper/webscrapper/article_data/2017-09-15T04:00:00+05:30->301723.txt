Vadodara: Even as issue of non-availability of reading room continues at the Faculty of Family and Community Sciences at M S University (MSU), several students went to the university head office to protest against alleged rude behaviour of a temporary lecturer of the faculty.

 As the reading room of the faculty has been turned into a classroom for the students of interior designing course, several students of other courses went there and started to use it as a reading room. The students alleged that after some time a temporary lecturer asked them to vacate the room.
 
 But, when they refused the teacher allegedly used foul language and pushed them out of there. Students demanded that the university authorities take action against the said temporary lecturer who misbehaved with them.
 
 A student said that 40 students are admitted in the interior designing course and their classed can be conducted at any other room in the faculty but still the classes are being conducted in the reading room due to which other students are facing problems.
 
 The interior designing course is run by the department which is headed by university registrar professor Neerja Jaiswal. The students had done protests outside the office of faculty dean too on September 9 over the same issue.
