New Delhi: A day after   put its admission prospectus on sale, its students called a day-long strike on Wednesday against implementation of the   gazette notification that has led to seat cut in research-based courses in some of its most popular schools. 

 The protesters assembled in front of different schools and urged other students to show solidarity by either not attending classes or giving exams a miss. “We managed to get few classes in School of Social Sciences and some presentations cancelled. However, the strike was called at the last moment, and it takes time to convince non-teaching staff to join us as they share a different relationship with the administration,” said Satarupa Chakraborty, general secretary of JNU Students Union. 
 
 The strike was, however, backed by most students of various political factions at JNU. Saurabh Sharma, of ABVP, said that after the court order to follow the UGC notification, the matter had gone out of the vice-chancellor’s hand and the movement needed to get out of the campus to be effective. “We are taking legal counsel.” 
 
 Students Federation of India is also looking at legal options while being part of protests at other universities as well. “A similar   was held at Hyderabad University, and this is a national movement. The government is responsible for filling up teacher vacancies that has led to the seat cut,” said Prashant Mukherjee, president of SFI’s Delhi committee. 
 
 The protesters, who burned the prospectus in front of School of Social Sciences II, said MPhil and PhD seats had been slashed from 970 to 102 in the coming session, which included cuts in School of Social Sciences — left with only 14 seats — and School of Languages (just 32 seats). No admission will be made at major centres like Centre of Historical Sciences, Centre for Political Studies and Centre for International Politics, Organisation and Disarmament. In several cases, deprivation points have also been removed.
