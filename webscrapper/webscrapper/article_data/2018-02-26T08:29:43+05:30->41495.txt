One afternoon, I received a call from a cameraman asking me to go and watch   in   that had just released. I went with my daughter Cuckoo and watched in awe. I told my daughter I wish I could get to work with a dancer like her. That evening, I got a call from Subhash Ghai, saying he wanted me to choreograph Sri for Karma. The phone almost fell out of my hand. 

 On our first day, I asked Subhashji if we should do a rehearsal and he felt it wasn't necessary as Sri was a good dancer. The song was 'Maine rab se tujhe' and the first shot took 13 takes. Afterwards, Sri told me: 'I'm a bad dancer. Please don't give me such hard steps without rehearsal.' I liked her honesty and willingness to learn. We became friends and made rehearsals a mandate. Before we shot Hawa Hawai, we didn't find a place to rehearse. So we went to Mehboob Studios and rehearsed in an open corridor outside the make-up room. 
 
 In every film, in every photograph, Sri's look, her expression is different. She was always experimenting. It was her idea to sport a curly haired look for Hawa Hawai. The first time I worked in a Yash Chopra film was when Sri coaxed him into taking me on as the choreographer on Chandni. Sri was trained in Bharatnatyam and used to a particular style of dancing in the initial years. It was during the shoot for Mitwa in   that she started working on softer movements. 
 
  The song 'Kaate nahi kat-te' needed passion. We told her a sari fluttering in breeze and clinging to her in the rain would make her sensuous. Also we decided against the usual black and white and opted for a Feroza blue. She told me, 'I trust you Masterji' and did as told.
