UDAIPUR: In pursuance to his father's objection on the police report been called by the authorities,   on Saturday sought clarifications from the government asking for the requirement and purpose of such a report. 

  in his letter said that as a citizen and a member of the family, he would like to know on whose instructions was the police report against   initiated and what procedure of law allows it. He also wrote that in a property related case, the city magistrate, Udaipur had on November 23, 1984, appointed the SHO of   police station as receiver of properties that were sealed by his grandmother and father on November 20, 1984.
 
 "In compliance with which order of the court has the police / administration handed over the said properties to the current occupants, that too without due notice to my grandmother or father?" the contents of the letter read. Vishvaraj has also attached a letter dated June 11, 2012, bearing no.2375 from the Additional SP(city) office, in reply to a query filed under the RTI Act that has brazenly denied having record of the appointment of Receiver and the order to hand over the said properties. 
 
 It may be noted that these properties continue to be the subject of litigation and record had to have been maintained regarding the same. There are other instances too where the administration / police have been found wanting. The above are only two examples of the conduct that I have been witness to and they are in themselves sufficient for me to re-iterate my father’s statement that, “Such is the worrisome anarchy that is the “administration” Vishvaraj wrote.
