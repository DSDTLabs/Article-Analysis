 Two BSP MLAs failed to turn up as Mukhtar Ansari is in jail, while MLA Vandana Singh is in Goa and is expected to return by Thursday afternoon.
 
 The BSP MLAs strongly condemned the "conspiracy" by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in denying imprisoned MLA Mukhtar Ansari his vote, as the government has challenged his parole for the polls on March 23. Another MLA, Hariom Yadav of the   (SP), is also in jail as the   government has opposed his release too.
 
 BSP chief   has also called a meeting of party MLAs on Thursday. Mayawati is learnt to have spoken to some of the MLAs directly on phone after she was given feelers that the BJP strategists were trying to influence them.
 
 The BSP leadership expressed satisfaction over the dinner as it turned out to be a show of unity. The MLAs' mood also sounded buoyant in the wake of BJP's defeat in the two byelections, which was ensured after their party supported the SP.
