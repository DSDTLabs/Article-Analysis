Panaji: The Goan Overseas Association of Toronto is all set to showcase Goan culture, cuisine and music at the upcoming Viva Goa festival which drew an attendance of over 3,000 last year when artistes, including Sonia Shirsat, Palomi Ghosh and O’Luv from state, enthralled the audience. The event, scheduled for July 29, is set to celebrate Canada’s 150th birthday with an exceptional line-up, including performances by local bands like Goa Amigos and Memory Lane, and sports events like bubble soccer, volleyball, swimming and carom. There would also be vendors selling authentic Goan food and pickles and a display of Goan art and craft along with young entrepreneurs showcasing their business.  “We are so looking forward to next week’s VIVA GOA, an event that brings our whole community together to celebrate Canada’s 150 years along with our rich Goan culture, cuisine and music. The event is about showcasing our pride in our culture and our ‘Goenkarponn’ as a unified community,” said the association’s president Selwyn Collaco.  The association, with its vision of a unified Goan platform, has started various programmes catering to different demographics, including fund-raising, athletic events, charitable activities as well as organizes shows of Konkani movies. “The membership is now thriving with Goans of all demographics from all origins such as East Africa, Middle East and India,” he added.
