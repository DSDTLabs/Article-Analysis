PUNE: A Rs 10 note may not buy much, but a quarrel over it led to the death of 30-year-old Sundaramma in the Janawadi area. 

 The victim’s neighbours humiliated her in public when she tried to retrieve a Rs10 note they had allegedly snatched from her son. Ashamed, Sundaramma set her self ablaze at her Janawadi home on Senapati Bapat Road on Thursday and she suffered critical burn injuries. She breathed her last on Sunday in a government-run hospital. 
 
 Her husband, Parshuram Shelar (30), lodged a complaint with the Chatushrungi police on Sunday evening. Shelar’s neighbours — Harish Laxman Gaikwad (19) and a 35-year-old woman — were arrested thereafter. The police have booked a 12-year-old minor girl, too.
 
 According to the police, Shelar’s son Rahul took Rs10 from home and was heading to a nearby grocery shop on Thursday morning. His neighbour accosted Rahul and snatched the Rs10 note.
 
 The boy returned home and complained about the act of their neighbours to his mother, Sundaramma. She decided to get back the money from her neighbours and went out of her house. 
 
 The verbal exchange between the two neighbours turned ugly after the suspects started abusing her in front of others. They then beat her up and threatened to kill her.
 
 After this public humiliation, Sundaramma returned home and set herself ablaze pouring diesel on her body. 
 
 The police said her husband was a casual labourer and the family was very poor.
