Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday ordered notice to the commissioner of Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by social activist Traffic Ramaswamy seeking direction to the government to provide facilities, including vehicle parking and to prevent protests near temples.

 The petition came up for admission before the division bench headed by justice M Sathyanarayanan.
 
 Ramaswamy in his petition had said that shops inside temples primarily destruct the heritage and their historical value. Many officials have entertained the shops for personal gains. Padmanabhaswamy temple in Kerala and Taj Mahal in Agra are kept intact because of strict non-profit motives.
 
 Hence, it was necessary to ban all forms of shops, except those selling items for Hindu rituals, inside temples including the Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam in Trichy, Meenakshi Amman temple in Madurai and Lord Shiva temple in Thanjavur. 
 
 He also wanted CCTV cameras installed in all important places in and out of the temples, to provide proper vehicle parking facilities and to deploy personnel from the Central Industry Security Force. 
 
 Besides, nobody should be allowed to go on strike, fast and protest inside the temples. 
 
 Shops situated outside the temples need to conduct business without hurting the sentiments of Hindus, he had said.
