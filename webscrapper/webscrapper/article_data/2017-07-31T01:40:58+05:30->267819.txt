NEW DELHI: Dozens of   installed on  , also known as Cell on Wheels (CoWs), can be spotted in Lutyens’ Delhi but New Delhi Municipal Council ( ) has said it has not given permission for such installations. 

 “NDMC has not yet permitted any CoW, but is considering the request of parties for the same. A policy is under process to take approval of the (tender) council, NDMC in this regard,” the municipal body said in reply to a series of applications filed by Supreme Court lawyer and RTI activist  . 
 
 In an earlier reply in April, NDMC had said that on the direction of returning officer of New Delhi, temporary permission was given to place mobile tower for 15 days at one location and after the expiry of the permitted period, the mobile tower was to be deactivated and removed. 
 
 The CoWs run on diesel gensets since they can’t get power connection till they are authorised and thereby are a cause of air pollution. Besides pollution, there has been a long debate on the impact of radiation from such towers on human health.
 
 Singh said, “All these are operating on government land and that too without any permission from the land owning agencies. This raises suspicion of big corruption in this field. When the enforcement department goes on removing small roadside shops, one can’t believe how such big towers are operating on prime government land. The civic body should give permission, provide electricity connection so that it can generate more revenue and reduce pollution as well.”
 
 The lawyer, who had earlier fought cases against dharnas at Jantar Mantar and illegal speed breakers, said he had written to NDMC chairman in May requesting him to investigate the matter. He had alleged that some organised gang in connivance with officials of the civic authority could be behind the operation, which was causing huge revenue loss to NDMC.
