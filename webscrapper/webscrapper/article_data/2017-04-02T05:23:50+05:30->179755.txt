New Delhi: A 25-year-old man murdered his brother-in-law (wife’s brother) suspecting him of   his wife into leaving him and staying with her parents.

 The accused, Mohammad Ghalib (25), suspected that Mehtab told his sister that Ghalib was involved with another woman, which made her drift away from him. 
 
 Police received a PCR call informing them about the incident at 9.30 pm on Friday night, soon after which they rushed to Mehtab’s residence in northwest Delhi’s Keshavpuram.
 
 Local residents, who had witnessed the incident, told police that Mehtab was at home with his sister when Ghalib reached there and got engaged in an argument with Mehtab, accusing him of brainwashing his wife and forcing her not to return to him.
 
 Neighbours stepped out of their houses when they heard sounds of breaking glasses and people screaming at each other. But before they could intervene, Ghalib had already stabbed Mehtab thrice with a sharp object.
 
 Witnesses caught hold of Ghalib and informed police. “A case was registered based on the statement of the woman and Ghalib was arrested,” said a senior police officer.
