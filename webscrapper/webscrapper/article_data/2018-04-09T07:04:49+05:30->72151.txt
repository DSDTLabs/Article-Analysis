AHMEDABAD: A special court here has rebuked the   ( ) for accusing an Income Tax officer of indulging in corrupt practice and accumulating assets beyond his known sources of income.

 While exonerating an IT officer Rajendra Kumar   of two corruption cases, special CBI judge H I   said that the officer was rated as outstanding and excellent performer by the department. Upon CBI failing to prove that Singhal had 174% disproportionate assets, the judge said, “It is also duty of the Investigating Agency to see that morale of this type of public servant should not be down or suffer otherwise.”
 
 According to Singhal’s advocate  , the IT officer was booked in 2008 in two cases while posted in   in   – first for demanding Rs 1.5 lakh from a party he was assessing and later for having assets more than his income permitted him.
 
 In the case of bribery, CBI officials claimed that Singhal was trapped demanding and accepting Rs 1.5 lakh and everything was audio-recorded. But nothing was proved. The court said that CBI “miserably failed” in proving charges. The audio recording was suggesting to a transaction other than his demand for illegal gratification.
 
 CBI also booked Singhal after cash of Rs 18 lakh was found from his residence in Gandhidham and Rs 1.44 lakh from a bank locker in Ahmedabad. Singhal’s advocate established that he was given Rs 16 lakh by his father to start a business. The court calculated Singhal’s income, expenditure, savings and the amount he received from his father and came to a conclusion that the charge was disproportionate asset was false.
 
 But the judge did not stop here and pulled the CBI up for lodging the case against Singhal, who was judged in his ACRs by his reporting officers as hardworking, outstanding and excellent hand, an asset for the department.
