 However, the BMC town plan put the proposal for widening the road in the draft DP-34, before sending it to the government for approval. It was to ensure that in future whenever the BMC wants, it could take the stretch for after giving notice to the gymkhana. “The government has approved the BMC proposal related with Hazarimal Somani Road,” said a senior civic official.
 
 It was alleged that BMC came up the footpath widening proposal after the Gymkhana refused to give permanent membership to a senior bureaucrat in the state government.
