AMBALA: Members of Sikh community staged a massive protest in Ambala on Wednesday after a local youth allegedly posted controversial comments about Guru   on his   account.

 A day after the post appeared and Sikhs took to street against the comments, Ambala police registered a case against accused Rajat Kumar, a resident of Ambala city.
 
 “An FIR has been registered on the complaint of Sant Singh  , a member of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), and other representatives from the Sikh community. The accused has surrendered before the police,” said Rajneesh, SHO, Ambala (city).
 
 Rajat’s post appeared on Monday night, and it was noticed by some Sikh youths from a nearby village who further brought it to the notice of their elders. Within a short span of time, the matter reached the Sikh organizations.
 
 “Such indecent comment against Sikh gurus won’t be tolerated by the community,” said Kandhari.
 
 “After going through the Facebook account of the youth, we went to the police station and asked to register a case and arrest him. Earlier, police were reluctant to take the matter seriously. A case was registered following our protests. We have also complaint to the Ambala superintendent of police regarding the dilly-dally attitude of the local police who did not take the matter seriously,” said SGPC member  .
