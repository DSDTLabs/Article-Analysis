NEW DELHI: The   has asked a city school to provide a list of shops/agencies, which supply school   and  , to  .

 HC’s interim order came after a section of parents approached the court complaining that they were being pressured by the school management to buy everything from the two shops within its premises.
 
 “As an interim measure, the school is directed to publish on its intranet [Amitra-net – parents section] information of all concerned, including the petitioners of the case, the particulars of other agencies where the textbooks or stationeries are available and can be bought from individually,” Justice R K Gauba noted.
 
 The court decided to step in due to an urgent plea by the parents in this regard. Even though the next date of hearing was in April, HC agreed to issue interim direction after the parents maintained that the school has a monopoly over the two outlets from which material can be purchased.
 
 In their plea, the parents claimed that the school has been insisting that the entire set of books must be bought from these outlets, even if they do not require the entire material and have managed to arrange books from other sources like students who have passed out from the respective classes in the last academic year.
 
 When the court sought to know from the school authorities its stand, the management submitted that the school won’t insist on procuring the books or stationeries from these two outlets and the parents can access these material from other agencies as well. The school also clarified that it won’t insist on purchase or use of new school uniform till the next date of hearing.
