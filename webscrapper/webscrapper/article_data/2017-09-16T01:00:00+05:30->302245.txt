It's been a year since the   concluded with four Indians winning medals, including Gurgaon resident Deepa Malik, who became the first Indian woman to win a Paralympic medal. Several organizations and state governments had announced cash awards and rewards to   and other winners. However, not all these announcements were followed through. On the anniversary of her medal win on September 12, Deepa tweeted to   CM   with a screenshot of his tweet from last year, wherein he had promised Deepa a cash prize of Rs40 lakh. Chouhan responded to Deepa's tweet, assuring her that she will be honoured during the Vikram Awards that the MP government is organizing soon. 

 
  
  
 
  Deepa tells us, "It had been a year since the announcement, but there had been no progress. Not just me, but all the other Paralympians who had won at Rio had been promised cash rewards but despite us following up on mail and phone, there was no headway. Twitter was my last resort and the anniversary of the medal seemed like a good time to do that."
 
 
  
  
 
  Deepa says she was pleasantly surprised by the MP CM's prompt response. She says, "I'd tried to meet him four months ago when I was in Bhopal to attend an event. But at that time the farmer suicides issue was raging, so my appointment got cancelled. None of us had heard back from the administration on this. It felt good that he was so prompt to reply. I'm hoping this will now lead to the promise being fulfilled."
 
  All the four para athletes who won medals at Rio Paralympics - Deepa, Varun Singh Bhati, Mariyappan and Devendra Jhajharia - have also been assured of cash rewards from the Maharashtra government. "Now that MP seems to have come around, we might tweet to the Maharshtra CM next!" says Deepa.
