MUMBAI: Alarmed by criticism of the law-enforcement agencies over their handling of the violence after the   incident, chief minister   has initiated a massive damage control exercise. 

 After the Maharashtra bandh call given by Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar, Fadnavis had interacted with prominent leaders from the community. On Friday, he called on acting chief justice   in connection with his plea for a judicial inquiry.
 
 Fadnavis confirmed to TOI that he handed over a letter to acting Chief Justice Vijaya Tahilramani and urged her to spare a judge for conducting a probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act in the Koregaon Bhima incident. Fadnavis had announced that an inquiry would be conducted under the Commission of Inquiry Act and a sitting judge of the   would be appointed to conduct the probe. 
 
 On January 3, three delegations met Fadnavis at his residence. First was led by Dalit icon B R Ambedkar's grandson Anandraj Ambedkar, second led by RPI (Athavale) leader   and former social justice minister and Congress legislator Chandrakant Handore also called on him. On January 4, Prakash Ambedkar and Rajendra Gavai met Fadnavis separately. The CM assured the Dalit leaders that the commission would be set up soon and the probe would be completed in a time-bound manner.
 
 On the demand that no criminal cases should be registered and that those arrested should be released, Fadnavis was noncommittal. The CM made it clear to the leaders that he would not tolerate violence.
 
 A senior RPI leader said, since the law-enforcement agencies have launched massive "combing operations" across the state, activists, who have been booked for their involvement in violence, are having a tough time. "Several activists have been arrested under the stringent conditions of the Indian Penal Code, but they may not get bail in the absence of adequate legal aid. Even if they get bail, they may not be released as they may not in a position to deposit the bail amount," he said.
