LUCKNOW: Sacked All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) member Maulana   on Thursday held the first meeting of his newly formed   and said that he would meet RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal for their support to ensure peace. 

  "Since 1947, there has been no such inter-religion united organisation that has worked to strengthen ties between communities and helped them all. This board will have representation from all religions and tribes to undertake welfare work within social, economic and legal limits," he said. 
 
 "This is our dream that we bring all religions together like a family against issues, such as   dispute, gau rakhsha, love jihad and other social welfare issues that divide people," he added.
 
  He claimed that Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar was also supportive of the newly formed board. 
 
  To be headed by a former chief justice, who will be chosen unanimously for a five-year term, general secretary to the board will be appointed from every religion. "We have made conveners in several states and they will then be forming inter-religious district level committees," he said. There will be eight committees in the board, including those for social reform, legal assistan- ce, medical assistance, women rights, children rights, finance committee, Shariah application bench and one for an Islamic university.
