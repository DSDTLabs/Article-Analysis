HYDERABAD: Apart from hall tickets, the board of intermediate education is receiving several requests from  , seeking permission for additional facilities or infrastructure to write the examination. 

 Talking to TOI, A Ashok, secretary,  , said on Tuesday, a day before the examination, they have got many requests from physically handicapped candidates asking them to allot a seat on the ground floor.
 
 "Over 1,300 students with special needs will write their exams this year and we have already informed the respective centres about these candidates. However, now, many students are approaching us saying that they have fractured a leg or have some other injury, which makes it difficult for them to climb the stairs," said Ashok.
 
 Lamenting that many students were not even getting their   to prove temporary or permanent disability, he reiterated that such facility was provided only for "genuine candidates".
 
 While the government said they would provide scribes to visually-impaired students, few students said that they had their own scribe and have sought necessary permissions to take them inside the centre.
 
 Hearing impaired candidates said that they had not received any clear information on if they will be getting additional time. "My daughter will be writing the exam at a centre at Miryalaguda and we requested the board to given her an additional 30 minutes to complete the exam. Although, we heard from others that extra time would be given, we haven't got any official communication from the authorities," said D Anand Rao, whose daughter   will be appearing for the exam on Wednesday.
