BENGALURU: Facing flak for the increase in attacks on police personnel, city police commissioner   on Saturday ordered them to shoot attackers in the leg.

 The directive comes following 13 attacks on policemen in the past week. Though most culprits were held, the attacks have demoralised lower-rung personnel and raised questions about their ability to protect the common man. The latest attack occurred on Friday night when the windshield of a police jeep belonging to   police inspector   was stoned by some miscreants when it was parked near the R T Nagar police station.
 
 
 
 
 
 The commissioner reportedly ordered his men to “shoot them (attackers) in the leg” if the situation warranted. He told reporters: “The police manual empowers cops to open fire on miscreants during dire situations.” Shooting criminals in the leg will not only immobilisz the criminals but prevent allegations of human rights violations.
 
 Kumar said personnel on night patrol have been instructed to carry their service rifles and at least four personnel should rush to troubled areas on receiving distress calls. Asked whether there is a pattern to the attacks, Kumar said: “While most attackers have been arrested, a few are still on the run. We have clues in all cases and will nab all those involved. Preliminary investigation revealed that the attackers are not habitual offenders. Some youths under the influence of drugs attacked policemen. A special team under DCP (West)   has been formed to handle these cases.”
 
 Policemen have been directed to crack down on liquor joints which operate beyond the stipulated time. “It has come to our notice that miscreants access liquor during the wee hours and party on the roads,” Kumar said, adding: “We’ve taken action against 30 such liquor joints .”
