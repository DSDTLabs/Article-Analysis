SRINAGAR:   militant  , who took over from   
  , has urged Kashmiri Muslim youths to pelt stones at security forces in the name of Islam, rubbishing Hurriyat’s claim that the militant movement was “secular” or for “freedom” and Kashmiri “nationalism”.

 In a 12-minute video, circulated widely on social media, Zakir Rashid Bhat, alias Zakir Musa, is seen preaching violence in the name of Islam.
 
 The terror outfit also separately directed voters to boycott the upcoming bypolls for two parliamentary seats and panchayat polls in the Valley.
 
 “When you 
  , don’t think you’re helping just one Musa or one mujahideen. You must do it to help and protect Islam,” Musa said. “We’ll hoist Islam’s flag in our Kashmir one day,” he proclaimed.
 
 Wearing an Afghan cap, a beige coat over a brown sweater, Musa appeared to be imitating Wani’s strategy of using IS-style videos and social media propaganda to lure youth into militancy. 
 
 Calling Kashmiri informers and J&K police “kafir” (infidel), Musa said both deserve to be killed. “We’re fighting for Islam. We want to be martyrs for our Islam.”
