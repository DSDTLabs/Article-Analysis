 Meanwhile, DMO said that the functioning of the naturopathy centre seemed mysterious in many ways. 
 
 "Many details of the centre were kept secret, including its medical practitioners' involvement in a similar case that took place in 2016. As this is third such incident in the district, strong police action is the only solution to put an end to such alternative medical practices," she said.
 
 Following the death of the woman, Dr Hyder had come out rubbishing the allegation of medical negligence. The family of the deceased woman had also denied that there were lapses on the part of the doctor and hospital staff members.
