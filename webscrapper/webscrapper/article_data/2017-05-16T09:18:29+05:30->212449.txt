The Indian women's crick et team scaled several new peaks on Monday when openers   and   put on a world-record 320-run opening stand during a mammoth 249-run victory over Ireland in the women's quadrangular series ODI match in Senwes Park, Potchesfroom.

 It's the biggest opening stand in ODIs not just for women but even for men.
 
 India scored 3582 and Ireland, in reply, were all out for 109 in 40 overs, handing India's women their biggest victory in terms of runs in ODIs.
 
 
  
 Deepti took just 160 balls to score 188 runs - the second-highest individual score of all time in women's cricket while Poonam scored 109 during their record stand, which lasted 45.3 overs.
 
 Deepti, who hit 27 fours and two sixes, is now India's highest scorer in women's cricket, second only to the all-time highest of 229 not out, scored by Australia's   against Denmark.
 
 Deepti broke the Indian record scripted by Jaya Shar ma, who had scored 138 not out against Pakistan women in Karachi in 2005.
 
 The Indian women's cricket team had not breached the 300-run mark in an One-dayer before this, with their previous highest being 2982 against the West Indies in 2004.
 
 Before Deepti and Poonam's marathon stand, the record for the highest partnership in women's cricket belonged to England's   and  , who had put on 268 for the first wicket against South Africa in 2008.
 
 With four victories from four matches, India are now the only unbeaten side in the tournament with wins over South Africa, Ireland (twice) and Zimbabwe. Ireland never looked in the chase as they scored the first fifty in 18.4 overs, losing the wicket of opener   (13) in the 17th over. From there on, Ireland kept losing wickets and lost half their side in the 30th over for 75 runs. Their slide continued as they managed to bring up the team hundred in the 37th over before India quickly mopped up the tail.
 
 Left-arm spinner   (418) scalped four wickets, while Shikha Pandey (316), who had provided the late charge with a 14-ball 27 for India, took three wickets. Earlier,   (144) claimed the only wicket by an Ireland bowler when she ended Deepti's innings by cleaning up the opener in the 46th over.
 
 Poonam too retired out in the last ball of that over. Ire land's poor show was reflected in the number of extras they conceded -26.
