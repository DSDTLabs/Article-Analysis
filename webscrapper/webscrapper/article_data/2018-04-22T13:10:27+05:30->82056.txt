THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The United Nurses' Association would go ahead with its plans for a state-wide indefinite strike from April 24 as the talks held between the association representatives and the state labour commissioner here on Saturday did not bring any breakthrough. 

 After the inconclusive talks, the association's president   said the nursing staff were forced to launch the strike owing to the government's failure to ensure the salary hike that chief minister   had promised last year. 
 
 The association has already announced that it would hold a long march from   to the state capital on Tuesday. The march has been christened as Walk for Justice. It will take about eight days for the protesters to reach Thiruvananthapuram and if the nursing staff at private hospitals stand united behind the association, the strike may upset the  . The association leaders alleged that both the hospital managements and the state government were not making any serious interventions to find a lasting solution to the underpayment to nursing staff.
 
 Though the minimum wage advisory committee had submitted its recommendations to the government, no decision was taken on it. The government's demand that it need 10 more days to take a final decision on the report was not acceptable, said the association leaders.
