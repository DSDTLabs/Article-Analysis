MUMBAI:   chief   on Thursday alleged that more than 20 lakh people are being deprived of foodgrain since their ration cards are yet to be linked to Aadhaar. 

 "The Supreme Court has made it clear that linking of Aadhaar to ration cards is not mandatory. However, the food and civil supplies department has refused to release foodgrain for those whose ration cards are not linked to Aadhaar. My information is that out of 19.52 lakh ration cards in Mumbai and Thane area, only 6.42 lakh ration cards are linked to Aadhaar,'' he said.
 
 Nirupam said the work of linking ration cards to Aadhaar has come to a halt, since the firm, which was given the contract, has abandoned the job. A senior bureaucrat described Nirupam's charges as baseless and false. 
 
 "Nirupam's homework is poor. In the recent past, the food and civil supplies department has issued instructions to rationing controllers across the state to release foodgrain even if the ration card is not linked to Aadhaar,'' he said. tnn
