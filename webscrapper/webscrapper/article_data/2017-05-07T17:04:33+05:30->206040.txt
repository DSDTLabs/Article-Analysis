A week after  's death in car crash, her mother   has poured her heart out on Facebook. She has mentioned that it was clearly   driving and negligence on her friend's part that claimed her daughter's life. Here's what she posted on Facebook.

 We had an angel amongst us for 27 years to show us what unconditional love was all about ... From the day she was given to us till the day she was taken away it was beautiful beyond comprehension ..she was our daughter 
  my best friend,my referee,my strength ,my life,my heart,my soul my pride and my joy,when her creator took her back to him it wasn't with any warning, tragically & untimely she was just snatched away it's been an entire week today & we can't imagi
 
 
 We need answers and we have not got any...why???what??? How?? She took the decision to trust a friend and trust her life with him at the wheel why did it go so wrong...not only did it end her life...but it was clearly reckless & rash ..negligence causing her life to be snatched away...she did not deserve this she was living life to the fullest planning so much more ...in the years she was amongst us humans she made a mark ,made a change ,believed in equality,true sports enthusiast,danced like a dream,supported good causes,was a true daredevil ,did it her way,believed in life compassionately...with love and care..generous and true,caring and responsible ....no one would know our child better than we do.
 
 Today I just want to say to all our family ,relatives & friends ours and Sonika's countless numbers to every single person who met her,worked with her, was associated with her in which ever way ,who came out on a very hot summer afternoon to wish her goodbye we are truly and unendingly thankful grateful and overwhelmed to say the least ... We drew strength from each one of you ...you all made the day much easier as we were not prepared for this final farewell to our one and only beautiful angel...who got wings .
