CUTTACK: Orissa high court on Friday ordered interim stay on the implementation of Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) February 3 order imposing a penalty of Rs 1 crore on Petroleum Conservation Research Association(PCRA), a society under the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, for allegedly putting up hoardings for a cycling event without seeking its permission.

  ordered the stay and directed the   to file its reply in the matter within four weeks.
 
 PCRA had organized a cycling event named Saksham Cyclothon on February 4 with an aim to make people aware of the need for fuel conservation. However, a day before the event   sent a notice to PCRA, citing that 2000 posters were put up within the BMC area without seeking its permission and without paying the necessary licence fee. The BMC had directed the PCRA to pay Rs 1 cr under BMC advertisement regulation, 2006.
 
  Challenging the BMC order, PCRA moved Orissa high court. The PCRA alleged that the notice is completely unfair and unjustified as they were not given an opportunity to make their stand clear on the issue. Besides, it also cited that it is a non- profit making body and had organized the event to create awareness among people about protection of nature. It did not intend to make to any profit out of the event. The
 
 “We had not done anything illegal. The hoardings and posters with pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi were installed in the city only to create awareness among the people about the need for fuel conservation. The notice issued by BMC to my client is completely unjust,” said petitioner’s counsel, Pitambar Acharya.
 
 After hearing both the parties, Orissa high court ordered stay on BMC’s fine notice and has asked it file its counter on the matter. The next hearing of the case will be held after four weeks. EOM
