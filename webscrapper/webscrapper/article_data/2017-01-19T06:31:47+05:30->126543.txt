PATNA: Thousands of   workers on Wednesday took out a ‘Jan Vedna March’ and demonstrated before the   (RBI) in Patna, demanding “right of money withdrawal” to people by lifting the restrictions imposed on it since notebandi on November 8 last year.
 
  The march was led by AICC secretary in charge of Bihar affairs K L Sharma and BPCC chief  . In a memorandum addressed to the RBI governor and submitted to the local RBI office, the party also asked the Centre and the central bank to issue a white paper on demonetisation.
  
  The memorandum also sought RBI governor Urjit Patel’s resignation over the “demonetisation mess”. “The RBI's autonomy and statutory powers have been subjugated and compromised, for which the bank governor is responsible,” Choudhary said.
  
  Choudhary, incidentally, is a minister in the state government headed by   who has supported notebandi.
  
  Earlier, the Congress workers, including women, from different parts of the state gathered near the historic Golghar around noon and marched towards the RBI office. As police stopped them near the JP roundabout from moving further, a delegation of senior party functionaries led by Choudhary, prohibition minister Abdul Jalil Mastan and   chief Amita Bhushan went to the RBI office and submitted the memorandum.
  
  Addressing the agitators near the JP roundabout, Choudhary said demonetisation has not only ruined the country’s economy but also led to the death of at least 120 innocent people. “Who is responsible for this human suffering?” he asked.
  
  CLP leader Sadanand Singh, minister Madan Mohan Jha, party’s chief whip in council Dilip Choudhary, BPMC general secretary Vinita Jha and legislators Vinay Verma, Poonam Paswan, Bhawna Jha, Anand Shankar and Tanveer Akhtar also participated in the demonstration.
