NAGPUR: Over 500 liquor shops and bars have shut while the yearly excise revenue came down from a whopping Rs 7.75 crore in 2014 to Rs 5.8 lakh in 2016 following the 2015 prohibition in  .

 At the same time, illicit trade of liquor has been thriving ever since the ban on liquor with Rs 32.89 lakh worth material being seized by flying squads of state excise department in Chandrapur and   in the first six months of this year.
 
 In sharp contrast, liquor worth Rs 8.38 lakh was seized in 2014, a year before imposing the prohibition in Chandrapur.
 
 The revelation came in response to an   query filed with the state excise department by Abhay Kolarkar.
 
 Officially the number of cases reported and registered have come down drastically but it only points to bootlegging being rife in the forested region. In 2014, 448 offences, resulting in 227 court cases, were reported by the flying squads but only 70, of which 22 are pending in court, were registered in 2017.
 
 Kolarkar said the revenue generated after the liquor ban must have come from the defence canteen, which are out of the prohibition ambit, though the department didnâ€™t mention the source. 
 
 The 507 wine shops, permit rooms, bars and restaurants were licensed to sell or serve foreign liquor, beer, countrymade foreign liquor and toddy. In 2014, the department recovered a revenue of Rs 7,75,74267 while the figure slipped to just below a crore to Rs 74,44,247 in 2015 followed by just Rs 5,80,399 in 2016. The figures for 2017 are yet to be made available.
 
 The effectiveness of making Chandrapur district liquor free with crack downs yielding material worth lakhs in the last couple of years has raised questions. From January 2014 to June 2017, 175 offences were registered and liquor worth Rs14.29 seized from rural parts of the Chandrapur.
