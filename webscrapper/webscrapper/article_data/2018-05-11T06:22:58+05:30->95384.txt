CHENNAI: An armed gang chased and hacked to death a 26-year-old man in busy   on Thursday afteroon following a quarrel over erecting banners, the   said. As news of the murder spread, incensed relatives of the slain man, S Madhan, damaged a few vehicles and the police had to use mild force to chase them away. Four people were later nabbed in this connection, but investigators refrained from naming them.

 The trouble began on Wednesday night when Kumaresan, a resident of   in Teynampet, questioned Madhan for putting up a flex digital banner congratulating a friend on his marriage there, saying he did not live there.
 
 
  
 
 
 At noon on Thursday, Madhan came home for lunch when he got a call and was abused. He spoke to his friend Deepak about this and they were walking on Rangoon Street, when eight men wielding sickles and cleavers chased and attacked them and even hurled stones at them. While Madhan collapsed, Deepak too suffered injuries and was admitted to Government Stanley Medical College Hospital. A woman resident of the area was also injured in the stone-pelting.
 
 Soon, a Teynampet police team arrived and sent Madhan’s body to   (GRH) for autopsy. A case of murder was registered.
 
 Some of Madhan’s friends alleged that the assailants were part of a gang of youths affiliated to a political party who spent the day lafing around, taking ganja and teasing women. “We have lost our friend,” said one of Madhan’s freinds. Others said he was an honest man who was targeted him as he was gaining popularity in the neighbourhood.
 
 Madhan had been assisting his father Sekar runing a sound equipment shop near   in Teynampet.
