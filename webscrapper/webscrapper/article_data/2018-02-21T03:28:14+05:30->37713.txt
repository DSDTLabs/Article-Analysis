MUMBAI: The Bombay high court said on Tuesday that the state must withdraw policemen from VIP security and instead deploy them to escort undertrial prisoners to court. 

 "You have provided [security] to VIPs. Withdraw and deploy them [for undertrials],'' said a bench of Justices   and   who was hearing a PIL on the shortage of police to escort undertrials to court and back.
 
 Amicus curiae, advocate  , informed that 110 jails and 482 courts are equipped with videoconferencing and in 2016-17 nearly 1.20 lakh undertrialswere produced through it. 
 
 This led the judges to comment that videoconferencing is to be used as an exception and not as a substitute. "You [state] are thinking they [undertrials] need not be produced. Just because the videoconferencing facility is there does not mean they are not to be produced,'' said Justice Dharmadhikari.
 
 Pradhan said the police is available for ministers, MLAs and MPs and even their relatives, but not for accused. "Their relatives are also entitled to protection and happy about it. They are virtual VIPs," he said. It was then that the judges remarked that the state must withdraw police from VIP security to provide for escort of undertrials.
 
 The judges recalled a practice in the sessions court for production of accused, saying there used to be a dedicated squad to produce accused and it prepared a list of all accused brought before the court."How can you (state) say they can be in jail and watch the court proceedings? We don't like it," said Justice Dharmadhikari.
 
 The bench said the state has to make arrangements to produce undertrials before the court. "If you don't make it, you will be failing in your duty. This is your foremost duty," said Justice Dharmadhikari. The judges have sought the state's response to it.
