PATNA: A day after a legal notice was served on RJD chief   and his younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav for making objectionable statements against chief minister Nitish Kumar, RJD’s national vice-president Shivanand   on Friday went on offensive against Nitish on the   scam. “Bhari jhuthe hain. Bolte hain pata hi nahi tha. Kum se kum 2013 se inko jankari thi. (He is a big liar. Nitish says he didn’t know about the scam, but he was aware of it at least since 2013,” Tiwari said at a presser at his party headquarters here on Friday. 

 “It was in 2008 that the then Bhagalpur DM   issued instructions to stop depositing funds from district treasury into the bank accounts of   Limited. Also, the Economic Offences Unit of Bihar police had also raided the house of Banka land acquisition officer   in July 2013 in a matter related to Srijan. Thus, the CM is lying if he says that he was not aware about siphoning of government funds by his officials and Srijan all these years,” Tiwari said.
