Noida: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) started the audit of the three development authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar district — Noida Authority, GNIDA and YEIDA — on Monday, six months after the state government gave its nod to the exercise. A three-member CAG team reached the offices of each of the three authorities and launched a detailed probe. 

 The audit will be carried out over the next three months. The CAG teams are expected to probe into the income and expenditure of the three authorities from 2012-13 till date across 14 points.
 
 Each of the three authorities has assigned a chamber to members of the probe team. Officials have been directed to assist the CAG team in every way and help them in obtaining the documents required. 
 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in an election rally in Ghaziabad last year pitched for a   of development agencies if the BJP came to power in the state. Soon after assuming office, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had in his second cabinet meeting given the nod for the probe.
 
 According to officials, an audit by the CAG, under Article 22 (2) of the UP Industrial Area Development Act, 1976, would be the “starting point” to unearth any financial irregularities at the three bodies during the Samajwadi Party regime. Until now, the state had its own system of audit. A state government agency based in Allahabad, Sthaniya Nidhi Lekha Pariksha, had been auditing the development authorities and its report would be presented in the state Assembly.
