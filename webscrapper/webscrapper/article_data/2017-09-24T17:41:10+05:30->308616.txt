CHANDIGARH: Even as the Supreme Court has ruled that only transgenders and eunuchs come under the category of third gender, a national-level institute under the Union ministry of human resource and development- National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research ( ) feels otherwise. 

 In what can be termed as a blunder, NITTTR’s recruitment wing mentioned gay as the third option in the gender column. This featured in an application which is to be filled by candidates looking forward to apply for various vacant posts in NITTTR. According to the form, only gay people can apply as third gender. The form was corrected thereafter and a correct version of the form was uploaded after the director’s intervention.
 
  
  
 When called and asked if transgender can apply or only gays can, an official from the recruitment wing said, “What are transgenders? Aren’t they same as gays?”
 
 Prof  , director NITTTR, Chandigarh told TOI, “I guess there is a mistake in interpretation. They must have thought that third gender is gay. I will get it corrected immediately.”
 
 Dhananjay  , a transgender student from  , who is also the unofficial member of transgender welfare board, formed by the Social Welfare Department, Chandigarh said, “We can take them to court for bringing gay and third gender in the same bracket despite the Supreme Court’s judgment that only transgenders can be termed as third gender.”
 
 Chauhan added, “This has also raised an important point about the need of awareness as maximum people are unaware about the difference between gay and third gender. People need to understand the difference. Terms like gay and lesbians are used for people, according to their sexual orientation and this orientation don’t change their gender. They continue to be male and female, respectively. Transgenders are different. I will be taking up the issue with the chairperson of transgender welfare board and discuss further course of action.”
