Gurgaon: Around 300   operators, who approached   Rao Narbir Singh on Saturday seeking leniency in the rule imposed by the Regional Transport Authority ( ) disallowing private vans from ferrying schoolchildren between school and home from April 1, had to return empty-handed.

 Private van owners fear the move will affect their livelihood and had hoped the minister would intervene in the matter. They have, however, been asked to follow the rules set up by the government.
 
 The move comes close on the heels of the January 31 accident wherein a   with 35 students on board caught fire in Gurgaon. The incident evoked alarm and raised question marks on the safety of schoolchildren.
 
 At present, Gurgaon RTA has around 1,610 school buses registered and there are around 24,000 private vans that fill the gap to cater to the demand of ferrying schoolchildren to school and back. But, as per the Surakshit School Vahan policy, private vans have been banned from transporting schoolchildren as they do not comply with the safety standards.
