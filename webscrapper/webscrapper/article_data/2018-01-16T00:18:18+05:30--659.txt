Tirupur: The city corporation is planning to provide underground drainage (UGD) connections to households directly. “We came up with the plan, because if the residents are allowed to establish the connections on their own, there would not be uniformity either in the time or work. Though the residents would relay the roads once the work is over, it would often lead to further damage of roads,” said Tirupur South MLA S Gunasekaran. The corporation will identify the households that need UGD connection and provide the connections. “We will then collect the cost spent on the work from the people, along with the other taxes,” said a senior corporation official. With more than 10 lakh population, the city has UGD system only in 18 out of 60 wards. Two years ago, the civic body had sent a detailed project report (DPR) for implementing new UGD lines in another 15 wards. However, for the Rs 350-crore project listed under Amrut scheme, the Union government is yet to allocate fund. Commenting on the civic body’s plan, CPM Tirupur district secretary S Muthukannan said, “The corporation should not collect money for setting up UGD connection. As it is already collecting various taxes, the move will put further burden on the people.”
