 “The officials from East Delhi Municipal Corporate (EDMC) submitted that NHAI is ready to use the segregated waste only for a pilot stretch. But if this can be done at a large scale, it will help solve the problem of the garbage pile up at different locations in Delhi,” said an official. NHAI is not keen to use the material in a big way considering that the material has never been used for laying foundation of major roads.
