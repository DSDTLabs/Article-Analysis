 on Thursday celebrated the 136th birthday of the much-loved author - Virginia Woolf - with a doodle. 

 One of Britain's greatest novelists, Woolf's influence on the literary world is still felt today.
 
 The doodle, visible on the Google homepage, illustrates the picture of Virginia Woolf surrounded by autumn leaves.
 
 The doodle that reflects Woolf's "minimalist style" was created by London-based illustrator Louise Pomeroy.
 
 Woolf was born in an affluent household in Kensington, London, on January 25, 1882. Woolf was born to the historian and critic Sir Leslie Stephen and the celebrated beauty Julia Stephen. 
 
 She was considered as one of the major icons of the feminist movement in the 1970s.
 
 Woolf's first piece was published in December 1904. She started writing for the Times Literary Supplement from the following year.
  
  
 The Voyage Out, the first novel of Woolf was published in 1915 by the Hogarth Press, a publishing house that she established with her husband, Leonard Woolf.
 
 A significant figure in London literary society, Woolf was also a central figure in the influential Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals.
 
 Some of the best-known works of Woolf include - Mrs. Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928), and the book-length essay A Room of One's Own (1929). 
 
 Woolf suffered from severe bouts of mental illness throughout her life. Woolf took her own life by drowning herself into the River Ouse near her home in 1941 at the age of 59.
 
 Her last novel was Between the Acts.
