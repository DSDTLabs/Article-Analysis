Panaj: Offering extra   (FAR) in special zones as part of a concept of transfer of development rights ( ) to compensate   property owners could help protect the quaint heritage ambience of Goa’s towns.

 A piecemeal approach of allowing heritage buildings to be knocked down to compensate owners is posing a serious threat to the unique conservation zones - the repositories of the state’s cultural heritage.
 
 Heritage lovers also decry outline development plans (ODPs) rolled out for Panaji, Mapusa and a few other towns by planning and development authorities (PDAs), as this could slowly deface the quintessential heritage ambience in urban areas. 
 
 PDA officials empathizing with heritage property owners justify the proposals as a means to mete out justice to them, but a well-thought plan can provide relief to heritage property owners, sources say.
 
 “As our heritage areas are under threat, the state can earmark some areas to pursue the TDR concept and this is where TDR rights can be sold,” says heritage activist Heta Pandit. 
 
 A central business district (CBD) like Patto in Panaji, with a special zone for high rise buildings is suitable for this concept. A holistic approach of creating special zones in newly urbanized areas with adequate infrastructure and services to cope with the requirements needs to be adopted, says architect Reboni Saha. 
 
 “There, they can decide to add two more floors and heritage property owners can sell their rights for cash,” Saha explained.
 
 A slew of suggestions, including the TDR concept have reached the new government. “We will examine and evaluate measures that will help in conserving our architectural heritage,” TCP minister Vijai Sardesai said. 
 
 Pandit, a heritage activist who then worked with Indian Heritage Society, Mumbai chapter, said better incentives to property owners and strict implementation or rules can help.
 
 “TDR will work, provided the receiving area and its community are consulted,” she said.
