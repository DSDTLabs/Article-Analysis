CHENNAI: A senior   professor, who was lodged in jail in Lucknow, is believed to have been arrested on the basis of a false complaint given by the accomplices of a money lender. 

 This was disclosed after the   last week arrested the money lender, M Kamaraj, and he made a confessional statement.
 
 In 2011, the   professor, M Sudheer, availed himself of a loan at a high interest rate from Kamaraj, who was based in Purasawalkam. Since then, police said, Kamaraj had been threatening and harassing Sudheer, demanding more money.
 
 When the professor refused, the money lender got his accomplices   and   in Uttar Pradesh to file a false cheating case in Aliganj against Sudheer, which led to the professor's arrest on February 24 this year by the Lucknow police. After questioning him, they took him to Lucknow. 
 
 The complainants alleged that the professor recieved 1 crore for getting permisson to start a medical college, but failed to keep up his promise 
 
 Last week, based on complaint from Sudheer's wife to the state home secretary and the DGP, Kamaraj was arrested by the Teyanampet police last week. The family also filed an RTI after lodging a complaint.
 
 Kamaraj in his confessional told police that the case against Sudheer was foisted and that he had given out loans to a few others at similarly high interest rates.
 
 Police are now probing to see if he had tortured any other victims in a similar manner.
