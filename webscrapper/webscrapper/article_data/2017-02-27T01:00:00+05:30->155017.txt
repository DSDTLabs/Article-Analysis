 has turned second time lucky! The actor’s  ,  , will play his heroine in the show 'Y.A.R.O Ka Tashan'. They had worked together in 'Bandhan' two years ago, but weren’t a couple back then. 

 Interestingly, Aniruddh was clueless about his wife bagging a part in the show. “I had no idea that she had gone for the audition and got finalised. Even my creative team kept it a secret. I learnt about it much later, during the mock shoot. She wanted to work with me and I am glad to have got a second chance.” 
 
 Ask him if he was instrumental in getting her the role and he replies, “No, every actor gets work on merit and no one can take that credit away. It would be interesting as she will romance my character, which is of a machine.” Will it be difficult for him to restrict his emotions while romancing his real wife? “On the set, she is just another co-actor. I am a professional and can't allow my personal life to dictate my work,” he avers.
