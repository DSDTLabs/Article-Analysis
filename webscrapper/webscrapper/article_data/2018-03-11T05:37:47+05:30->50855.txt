BENGALURU: Chief election commissioner   said on Saturday that the poll panel will resume the seeding of   with voter identity cards as soon as it gets the nod from the  . The process was halted in 2015. 

  Over 32 crore Electoral Photo ID Cards (EPICs) have been seeded so far. "We stopped the linking process after the Supreme Court began hearing matters on Aadhaar's validity. But with several government schemes and other services being linked to Aadhaar, a window of opportunity has been thrown open. The commission has filed a petition in the SC regarding seeding Aadhaar with EPICs. Once we get the clearance, we'll restart the linking process," said Rawat. 
 
 "We have been periodically issuing voter's IDs across the country. A total of 87 crore IDs have been issued until now. So, barring the 32 crore already seeded, we have to seed the remaining 55 crore IDs with Aadhaar," he said.
 
 Rawat admitted that despite countermanding polls in as many as three assembly constituencies due to huge misuse of money, there is no respite. "Despite our best efforts with warnings by way of countermanding elections in three or four Assembly constituencies, the use of money has been growing and it is unabated," he said.
 
 Quoting the instance of the R K Nagar byelection in Tamil Nadu last year, wherein Rs 89 crore was distributed in just one constituency, Rawat said the commission took cue from SC rulings to countermand the elections. "However, it remains a mystery as to how the eventual winner secured the highest margin of votes in the election history of that constituency," wondered Rawat on a lighter note, commenting on TTV Dhinakaran's victory in the seat held by late chief minister and   supremo J Jayalalitha.
 
 Rawat was in Bengaluru to attend the 14th annual conference of the   (ADR) and Karnataka Election Watch at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM).
