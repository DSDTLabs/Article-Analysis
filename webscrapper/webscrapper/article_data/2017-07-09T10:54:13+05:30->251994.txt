JAIPUR: The traffic department may be gloating over tables and graphs suggesting ‘decline’ in traffic deaths in Rajasthan, but on Saturday, dumper trucks snuffed out four lives in two separate   in Churu and Jaipur and left many families devastated in their bloody trail.

 The first accident was reported from Churu where an uncontrolled dumper truck rammed into a stationary bus on Sadlpur-Churu road. Three women died in the accident whereas several others were reportedly injured in the mishap.
 
 “The bus was on a return journey from Haridwar to Ladanu in Nagaur. Near Churu, the bus broke down. The driver parked his bus alongside the highway. At 6.30 AM, a dumper truck lost control and rammed into the stationery bus,” a police official told TOI, adding that while some passengers were sleeping inside the bus, others had alighted and moved away from the busy highway.
 
 The victims were identified as Tana Devi, Bhanwari Devi and Geeta Devi. Cops said they were returning from pilgrimage in Haridwar. The driver deserted his truck and fled from the accident site to avoid police action. However, the cops have recovered documents from the truck’s cabin and making efforts to arrest the driver.
 
 The injured were rushed to hospital in Churu and bodies were kept at a mortuary. In another accident in Shahpura in Jaipur rural, a 20-year-old girl died after an overloaded truck hit her on Saturday morning.
 
 At 8 AM on Saturday Monkia Khandelwal was driving pillion on her father Giriraj Khandelwal’s scooter. “Giriraj was on her daily ritual to feed monkeys and stray cows. They were returning back when a dumper truck hit their scooter from behind. Monika was tossed up in the area and fell on road, the truck run over her,” the police official said. The driver fled from the scene while Monika was killed on the spot. He father was rushed to the hospital for minor injuries. Her body was handed over to the family after post mortem.
