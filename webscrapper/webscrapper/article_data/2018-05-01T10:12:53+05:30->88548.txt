CHANDIGARH:Amid the ongoing tussle between the councillors and officials of municipal corporation over the hiked   charges, members of finance and contract committee (F&CC) and the mayor, in the monthly house meeting on Monday, agreed on moving a resolution in the general house meeting to terminate the   signed between MC and the firm, which was in-charge of the paid parking lots in the city. Three month’s notice would be issued to the firm before annulment of the agreement.

 
 The members of F&CC once again raised the matter in the monthly meet on Monday citing the public anger on the issue. The MC officials clearing their stand said they did nothing but implement the MoU, which had already been passed in the general house meet last year, abiding by their roles and functions.
 
 Raising the issue, the F&CC members said the enhanced charges are not justified at all as Rs 20 for four hours is too much for the public given there are no facilities available on the ground. “Why did the officials not check the conditions before increasing the parking charges in the paid parking lots,” asked one of the F&CC members.
 
 Responding to the questions raised, the MC officials said the last call in the entire matter was to be taken by the general house and thus if the house had been of the view that the paid parking charges are not in the best of public interest, it can simply move a resolution to annul the MoU.
 
 A total of 19 agenda items were placed before the F&CC for the discussion and approval and all the agendas have been passed unanimously by the members of the committee.
 
 Besides other, purchase of 44 breathing apparatus sets for fire and emergency services department, repair of Sehaj Safai Kendra in sectors 22 and 33, parking space for differently-abled persons near their offices, upgradation of sewerage system at Kajheri village, Sector 52, providing new storm water drainage system and construction of manholes/road gullies in Faidan village, upgradation of existing sewerage system by providing additional sewer lines and construction of additional manholes on existing sewer line in tenement flats of Bapudham colony of Sector 26 were some of the crucial agenda items, which have been discussed and passed in the meeting.
