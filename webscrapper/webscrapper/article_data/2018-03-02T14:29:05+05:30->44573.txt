 Samrat comes and tells her that they got standing ovation for their performance. She tells Samrat that they broke rules when she took Saisha's place and they might get disqualified.
 
 Later, KK declares Saisha's team as the winner but Samrat says they can't take the prize as they broke the rules. KK gives the prize to the runners up. As the kids celebrate, they bump into Neil and his wallet falls down. He picks it up and searches for the thank you note.
 
 Goons tells Saisha that they had won, but they still didnâ€™t get prize because they broke the rules. Just as the goons are about to leave, a lady beats them up and gets them arrested. The lady turns out to be police officer, Mitali.
