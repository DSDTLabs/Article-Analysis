INDORE: Peacocks of Indore have started moving away from the city. Data released by the forest department, however, states that the population of peacocks is increasing in the districts. 

 In a recent campus bird the counting conducted by Bird Count India, experts found out that the population of peacocks is shifting away from the unprotected areas in the city due to human intervention.“We surveyed   of Management and Research last week, the area had more than 20 peacocks two years ago which came down to 3-5 birds in the last year. This year not a single   was spotted,” said  , MP state coordinator of   campus bird survey. The survey also found out that the population has not gone down in the outskirts and protected areas. 
 
 The population remains the same in Mhow area. “We did not find any change in the population of peacocks in Mhow, this might be because this is a cantonment area and is mostly protected,” said   secretary of The Nature Volunteers, an NGO working in field of the bird and animal conservation.
 
 Similarly, the population of the birds remained on the higher side at Daly College. “Here we have made proper arrangements for their diet and living condition, there is less of intervention,” said Kanakbala, a teacher of Daly College and bird expert.
 
 Experts said that while the population has gone down to zero in the Govindram Seksaria Institute and nearby areas, the trend can be observed in the entire city.“You cannot easily spot peacocks even in area like Palasia and Saket where they were found in abundant a few years ago. This is a sign of great concern,” Gadikar said. Experts said that the loss of habitat, less availability of food and poaching were the main reason behind the decrease in count. Forest department has identified 22 such clusters in the region. Around 3,900 peacocks were counted in the year 2014. The number rose to 5,370 in 2016.
