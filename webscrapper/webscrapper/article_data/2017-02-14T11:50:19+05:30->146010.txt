Actor   was at his witty best when he posted on his social networking page a photo of his daughter, who had shaved her hair off recently. The highlight of it all was the caption he gave in jest, which said the tiny tot bared it all, as an offering to god at Velankanni Church, so that her father's films would go on to become smashing hits. He also tagged it as Tovino Thomas' psychological move to garner 'family sentiments', and added that he was proud of her. 

 However what followed came as a surprise for many, as anticipating trolls from netizens, he himself posted a reply in the comments section a picture of actor Dileep and his daughter from her younger days, who had also coincidentally done the same thing. Tovino was speaking to trollers saying they needn't be scratching their heads to find the snapshot of the 'KIng LIar' actor and his daughter.
