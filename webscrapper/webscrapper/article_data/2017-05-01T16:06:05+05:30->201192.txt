LUCKNOW: The slogan, 'UP ko yeh saath pasand hai’ is history. 

 Speaking for the first time on electoral issues since the   alliance failed in the assembly elections, UP Congress chief Raj Babbar on Sunday said that his party will contest the state civic elections on its own. 
 
 
 
 “We have decided that the Congress will contest the forthcoming urban civic polls alone in Uttar Pradesh, without allying with any party, including the Samajwadi Party,” Babbar told TOI after a series of meetings with party officials over the last one month. 
 
 Babbar said before taking any decision, it was important for the party leadership to take a view on the alliance, so there were meetings with district level workers, the winners in the elections, and those who secured more than one lakh votes. Party officials have been told to focus on the elections and mobilise committed workers, said Babbar.
