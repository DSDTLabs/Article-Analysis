'Kaalakaandi', a quirky, dark comedy written and directed by debutant Akshat Verma, (previously wrote 'Delhi Belly') stars Saif Ali Khan, Vijay Raaz, Deepak Dobriyal, Sobhita Dhulipala, Kunaal Roy Kapur, Isha Talwar, Shenaz Treasurywala, Nary Singh and Akshay Oberoi. Four of this five-song album has been composed by   while the title song has Shashwat Sachdev’s music. 
 
 The first track 'Swagpur Ka  ', with a distinct Haryanvi twang (the way 'Chaudhary' becomes 'Chodri'), has a trippy feel to it. Penned and sung by Akshay Verma, it is all about funk music with elements of psychedelia and reminds you of the unmissable swag of 'Delhi Belly’s music. 
 
 The next, 'Kaala Doreya', is a remix of a popular Punjabi wedding folk. However, the soundscape here is once again psychedelic and Neha Bhasin’s rendition along with British rapper Raxstar, gives the track a completely contemporary feel. The slowing down of the beats in this rehash, however, does not add much to it. 
 
 'Jive With Me', has a very retro sound and the electro-swing genre works for it. The sound is about nostalgia-meets-futuristic and combines vintage swing and jazz with hip-hop and electronic dance music. Sung by Abhishek Nailwal and penned by Anvita Dutt, this song could have you tapping your foot.
 
 Anvita’s lyrics are fun, quirky and in-your-face in the title song 'Kaalakandi'. Lyrics like ‘Haathon pe taash ke patte, Ikke pe do-do ikke, Phir kyon kismat ne aake, Kheli mujhse saap-seedhi. Chaati pe mung daali, Phir maine papad belein, Toh kyon kismat ne aake, Gur badle gobar de di’, take the cake. This situational track with its madcap, entertaining vibe, has multiple singers including Shashwat Sachdev, Vivek Hariharan, Romy and Arun Kamath. 
 
 Vishal Dadlani and Abhishek Nailwal nail it in the next track 'Aa Bhi Jaa' — the funky beats elicit a head bob. Overall, this film is touted to be quirky and once you listen to all five tracks, you know that the soundtrack definitely goes with it.
