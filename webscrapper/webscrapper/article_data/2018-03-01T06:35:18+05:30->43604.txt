NEW DELHI: Known as   among the locals and respectfully addressed as  ,  , 67, wasn’t the sort to evoke  . But after his arrest on Tuesday for raping the nine-year-old daughter of a   at the madrassa he ran in Bawana, police are probing whether he had sexually assaulted other children too.

 “Though nothing has cropped up so far, we’re suspicious since the number of kids going to the madrassa has dropped to seven-eight from 30-40,” a police officer said. A native of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, Alam came to the area in 2004, erected a hut on encroached government land and starting giving lessons to children.
 
 “He never beat anyone when teaching,” said Abdul Sattar (11). The man was especially kind to the girl he raped. As a student revealed, “The hafiz often gave her sweets and other eatables.”
 
 The girl’s aunt said that the maulvi had come to the house on Tuesday as the family were preparing to take her to a doctor. “She started crying on seeing him,” the aunt said.
 
 The family alleged on Wednesday that after the maulvi’s arrest, his relatives were threatening them. “They are accusing us of implicating the man in a false case to tarnish his reputation,” one of the girl’s family members said. Alam has two surviving sons of the three who had come with him from Bihar, both of them autorickshaw drivers.
