MYSURU: The proposal to widen, and straighten the 850m-stretch of   between Paduvarahalli 4th Main Road and the Valmiki Road Junction near Kalamandira had triggered a massive public protest, who demanded that the project be shelved since it would have sounded a death knell to 79 trees lining the road. Bowing to public pressure, the   ( ) has significantly altered its original plan – under the modified proposal, only seven trees will be felled in place of 79.

 In association with the public works department, NHAI had proposed to widen this stretch that had seen many accidents owing to a steep curve near Kalamandira. The authorities had proposed to upgrade the existing four-lane road to a six-lane road to prevent further accidents, and allocated a sum of Rs 12 crore under the Central Road Fund grants for the same.
 
 However, a massive public protest erupted that was spearheaded by members of the Mysuru Grahakara Parishat. The citizens voiced reservations about the adverse impact that the project might have on the environment, and approached the court and brought a stay on the project.
 
 Taking cognisance of public opinion, NHAI decided against turning the road into a six-lane street, and have decided to widen the thoroughfare by around 1m on either side.
 
 “Earlier, we would have had to cut 79 trees, but now we will have to fell only seven. We have also informed the MGP about this. Work on the road will commence once we receive orders from our superiors,” an NHAI officer said.
