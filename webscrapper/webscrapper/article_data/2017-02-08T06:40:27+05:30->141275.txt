AHMEDABAD: Gujarat which had become infamous for the high number of people during the 2002 riots, is among the top Indian states in number of casualties in  . Gujarat is ranked sixth among all Indian states in the number of deaths caused by sectarian violence. It is followed by Uttar Pradesh (77 deaths), Maharashtra (32), Bihar (29), Karnataka (26), Madhya Pradesh (24) and Rajasthan (24 deaths).

 Figures released by the Union home ministry indicate that Gujarat registered 182 incidents of communal clashes between 2014 and 2016. At total of 21 people lost their lives in these riots and 494 sustained injuries.
 
 In the same period, 2098 incidents of sectarian violence were reported in the entire country. In these riots, 278 people were killed and 6,506 people injured, says MHA data. 
 
 Gujarat accounts for 7.5% of the total number of deaths reported in coummunal violence in the country in three years — 2014 (7 deaths); 2015 (8); and 2016 (6 deaths). The state reported 74; 55; and 53 incidents of communal violence and 215; 163; and 116 injured respectively in the same three years.
 
 The   expose the claims of various political leaders who boast that Gujarat did not witness a single incident of communal violence and curfew was never imposed in the state after the 2002 massacres which took a toll of over 1,000 lives.
 
 Sources in the state home department said that communal violence in the state was sporadic in this period; hence, they did not get attention. Besides, the MHA must have included violence during the Patidar quota agitation which can be considered as communal violence. 
 
 Human rights activist and city-based lawyer   said that incidents of communal violence occurred in places like Vadodara, Kutch, Bharuch and also in Ahmedabad during this period.
 
 “Casualties in these communal incidents must have occurred in police firing because the violence was not so intense and people did not kill each other in the name of religion or community. But I am also sure that most of the victims must have belonged to the minority community,” Pathan told TOI. The lawyer had represented victims in the 2002 Naroda Patia riot case. 
 
 Minister of state (home)   was not available for comment on the MHA figures.
