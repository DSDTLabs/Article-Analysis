DEHRADUN: On the reasons behind him and his father joining the BJP on Wednesday,   claimed that Congress had “completely ignored ND Tiwari in the past few years.” He was of the opinion that the senior Congress leaders had completely “sidelined” Tiwari after his tenure as CM ended.

 Rohit did not fail to mention that barely few days back Tiwari had fallen ill and not a single Congress leader of Uttarakhand cared to ask about his health. “Only the CM of Uttar Pradesh called up to know about his health. It is shocking for me and the entire family that a man who has completed 75 years in politics and served Congress for over five decade holds no importance for the party,” he added.
 
 According to Rohit, the decision was taken due to the ignorance of the Congress. “Barring the Uttarakhand Ratna award, there has not been a single function in the last few year when he has been felicitated. The projects started in his tenure as CM are lying in shambles. He even cried after seeing the condition of   at Haldwani but the Congress government took no note. It was simply impossible to breath in such political environment,” said Rohit.
 
 The polling for the state elections is scheduled on February 15, for which the nominations are to start from January 20. With BJP yet to announce its candidate from Lal Kuan and Haldwani, Rohit is being seen as a party candidate from either of the two seats.
 
 “There has been a lot of protest in Kumaon region after the BJP list was announced, therefore I do not want to further burden the party by staking claims for a particular seat. I and my family is here to serve the BJP, Uttarakhand and the entire country. If the party feels to give me some opportunity or chance to prove myself, I will definitely put in my best,” said Rohit.
