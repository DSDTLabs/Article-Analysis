CHANDIGARH: Reminding chief minister Captain   about his promise to root out synthetic drugs in   within four weeks of coming to power,   (AAP) senior leader   said that the countdown had already begun.

 “I am sure that Captain Amarinder Singh will fulfil his promise and curb drug supply in Punjab by April 16 (30 days), the date by which all drug peddlers in Punjab will be sent behind bars,” he added.
 
 He said that even AAP would cooperate with the CM to make Punjab drug free within a month. “Everybody in Punjab knows who were behind the drug supplies. Now, Amarinder should dare to take action against the drug lords of Punjab,” he said.
 
 The AAP leader also appealed to the CM to ensure appropriate arrangement of staff and medicines at drug de-addiction centres in the state.
 
 He reminded Amarinder and his ministers to shun “VIP culture” and the use of red beckons on official vehicles. “After all, it was promised by the party in its poll manifesto,” he said. “Time is ripe for the Congress to fulfill them.”
