BHOPAL: Chief minister   announced on Friday that state government will double the grant to madarsas to Rs 50,000. He was speaking at the 20th Foundation Day of Madarasa Board.

 Invoking  , the chief minister said, “This message is of love and respect, these are beautiful words of Prophet Mohammad. He said love for watan (country) is love for religion and if that is not a message of love then what else is,” said Chouhan, adding that the Madarsas should follow the Prophet’s saying.
 
 The foundation day celebration was held at Hotel Imperial and was attended by young and adults alike in large numbers. Addressing the gathering, the chief minister greeted the board on completing 20 years and said that in addition to religious education, modern education is equally important in the present age. “In modern times, it is important for children to be extremely talented. They need technical education. Why should a madarsa student not know about computers? Why leave him behind?”
 
 Announcing a grant of Rs 50,000 to madarsas — double from the present Rs 25,000 the chief minister said that the state government has never differentiated on the basis of religion while planning welfare measures. Expressing concern over the   game, he urged students to use their smart phones to study and not to play the dangerous game or saying ‘hello-hi to each other.’
 
 Chouhan said that the students are ‘gifts of God’, and it is the responsibility of the government to make their lives better. He said that the aim of the government is to provide good education to all students and make them self-reliant.
 
 The chief minister also honoured 50 madarsas, seminary teachers and talented students on the occasion. He also released a souvenir showing the progress of the Madarsa Board and appreciated the board’s headway in modern education. Syed Imaduddin, Chairman of Madarsa Board said that so far 2575 madrassas have been registered where two lakh 88 thousand students are studying.
