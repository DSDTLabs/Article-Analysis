ALLAHABAD: The arrest of bandit sympathizer   on Sunday night has come as a major success for the police who hope to break the network of   operating on UP-MP border. 

 Jugul, who is the brother-in-law of slain bandit Ambika Patel alias Doctor alias Thokia, was arrested by Chitrakoot police on charges of supplying weapons, cartridges and essential commodities to MP- based Lalit Patel gang near Kodhanpourva village when he was allegedly going to deliver weapon and other items to the dacoits.
 
 SP Chitrakoot, Pratap Gopendra, told TOI that Jugul Patel, a resident of Mazra Khambharia, was arrested under the intensified combing operations launched on UP and MP border. He was working with MP-based Lalit Patel gang. 
 
 Police said that Jugul was one of the member of the gang when slain dacoit brigand Ambika Patel alias Thokia had killed six commandoes of   (STF) in Chitrakoot in 2007. 
 
 After the elimination of Thokia, Jugul too was arrested by the police and had remained behind bars for more than two and half years. 
 
 However, after being bailed out, Jugul had again jumped into ravines and was working as a key operative for Lalit Patel gang.
