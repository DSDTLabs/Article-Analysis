Hit by a triple whammy in the form of demonetisation, the RERA Act and GST, the residential realty sector in Chennai hit a new low in 2017. New launches fell by 13% and failed to touch the fivedigit mark, sales fell by 4%, hovering just above 15,000 units, and the average asking price for apartments fell by about 3%. Customers who drove a hard bargain got reductions of up to 10% in apartment prices, in the form of cash discounts or freebies, says Knight Frank’s latest report on the sector.

 “Compared to sales and launches in 2011, the fall in 2017 is 56% and 86% respectively. Political instability, natural calamities and overall gloom in market sentiment stagnated signs of recovery noticed in the first half of 2017. A shaky employment scenario has hurt sentiments and encouraged deferment of purchase,” said Kanchana  , director — Chennai, Knight Frank, releasing the report in the city on Wednesday.
 
 All India launches also fell to abysmal levels, down 78% from the peak of 2010 and 41% lower year-on-year, she said. As against new launches of 4.8 lakh units in 2010 across eight major markets — Mumbai, NCR, Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad — only 1.03 lakh units were launched last year. Sales hit a seven-year low, 38% down from the peak of 2011 in all eight markets. While 3.68 lakh apartments and houses were sold in 2011, only 2.28 lakh units were sold last year. “Low sales velocity, high unsold inventory, expectation of further price reductions and inadequate RERA implementation kept buyers away,” Krishnan said.
  
  
 Except Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, other major markets recorded a fall in prices ranging from 2% to 7%, the report says. Pune took the biggest hit (7%) and Hyderabad posted the highest increase (3%) in prices.
 
 The age of unsold inventory is a matter of concern, said Krishnan. “While a healthy age of unsold inventory is about seven to nine quarters, the age of Chennai’s unsold residential inventory has crossed 14 quarters. A year ago, it was 12.9 quarters,” she said. Developers continued to focus on offloading existing inventories during the second half of 2017 by re-launching old products at lower prices wherever possible, she said.
 
 The Chennai residential market, as of now, holds inventory to sell over the next 18 months. It may look a healthy scenario, but 2018 is unlikely to see a revival of sentiment. It will continue to be a buyer’s market throughout the year, she said. A silver lining is that apartments priced below ₹25 lakh are selling well.
 
 Confederation of   Developers’ Association of India Chennai chapter president  , admitting to a decline in sales from 2013, says hope is not lost. “There was a 75% drop in launches in the city in 2017 compared to 2012, when launches peaked at 37,000 units. Sales, however, have dropped only by 50% during the same period. [Fewer] new launches can be attributed to developers being cautious about clearing unsold stock. After the introduction of RERA and GST, profit margins have thinned. Only firms run professionally can survive in this environment,” Krishn said.
