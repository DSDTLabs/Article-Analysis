THRISSUR: The body of an   official, missing since a chopper crash off Mumbai on Saturday, was found and brought ashore on Thursday.

 ONGC officials said the body of   native Bindu Lal   was found during a search operation by the vessel, Sagar Seva, and was flown ashore in a helicopter.
 
 Babu's wife Dr Shiny and other relatives identified the body, now kept at the Dr R N Cooper Municipal  , Andheri, Mumbai. He will be laid to rest around 12 noon at Vasai, the deceased man's elder brother Ajith Babu said.
 
 Earlier, the bodies of all others-including two Malayalis-in the ill-fated copter-four DGM-level officials and two pilots-were found.
 
  Babu had joined the ONGC after acquiring a degree in Marine Engineering from Dhanbad,  . His wife Dr Shiny has been practicing as a diabetologist in Mumbai and the couple has a son,  , who is studying in second standard and a daughter   who is studying for Plus II.
 
 His colleagues at the ONGC remembered him as a committed person. "He was very passionate about the work, and was willing to undertake any risky operations,'' P K  , executive director of the ONGC, said.
 
 "I knew him for the past 20 years and we used to joke that he was married to ONGC. His wife also had expressed similar views when we visited her on the second day of the accident,'' said Thomas Chacko, a colleague of Babu and secretary of ONGC Malayali association.
 
 The ONGC officials said Babu had had a miraculous escape during the fire in Mumbai High North Platform, on July 27, 2005.
 
  A vessel had then collided with the platform, 160 km west off Mumbai coast, causing a major fire, resulting in 11 deaths and 11 others missing.
 
 Babu was one of the 100-odd survivors of that disaster.
