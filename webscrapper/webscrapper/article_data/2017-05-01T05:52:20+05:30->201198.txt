CHENNAI: Many in the area have dubbed it the new   in the city. A pile of vehicles in the   estate, all of them seized in relation to crime cases, has proved to be a big hindrance for pedestrian and vehicular movement in the area.
 
 The heap contines to grow by the day as the Guindy police dump vehicles there, but repeated complaints to find auctiona off the vehicles or find another site have been in vain.
 
 Each month, the huge number of two-wheelers, autorickshaws and other vehicles involved in cases of accidents, chain-snatchings and other crimes that are pending before the courts are indiscriminately dumped in front of the SIDCO office by the jurisdictional police. They lie there until the case is disposed of, and it could take months or even years.
 
 “This is a busy area where a number offices and industries are located. There is a large floating population as well and the vehicles hampering pedestrian movement. Police should either auction the vehicles off or find an alternate area to keep them,” said  , who runs a shop in the area.
 
 This is easier said than done as personnel of the Guindy police station say they have no idea where to dump the vehicles. “It is up to senior officers to find an alternate spot or move the courts so that we can auction these vehicles,” said an officer.
 
 Enuring that parts from the vehicles are not stolen is another additional responsibility, he added.
 
 The ever-growing pile of vehicles has almost completely eaten up the pedestrian path. “MTC bus driver struggle to pass through this junction to enter the Guindy industrial area. There have been many accidents here, injuring several pedestrians,’’ said P Shivakumar, a 45-year-old tea vendor.
 
 Exposed to the elements, most of the two-wheelers in the dump are rusting. Some of them were involved in accidents or crimes that occurred more than a decade ago, officers at Guindy police station said.
