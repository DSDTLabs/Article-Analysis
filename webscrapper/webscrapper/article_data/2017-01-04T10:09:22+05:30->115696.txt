 Suresh Bhat B, district president of the forum and member of People’s Union for Civil Liberties, who compiled the report, told TOI that the number of communal incidents have reduced in 2016 because of several reasons. “They have reduced mainly because of effective policing. Similarly, it seems that vigilante groups from both communities may have changed their agenda. It is very difficult to analyse the agenda of perpetrators of moral policing as vigilante groups have their own motifs, either political or monetary,” he said.
