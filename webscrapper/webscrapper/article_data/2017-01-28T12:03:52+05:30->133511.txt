IMPHAL: Congress spokesperson   on Friday said the state government is all prepared to urge the Centre to declare   (UNC) as an unlawful organisation. 

 Talking to the media at the   here, Singh said Manipur has been facing a commodity crisis owing to the UNC-sponsored economic blockade which entered the 87th day on Friday. The   apex body intensified its stir and claimed that the state government's move to create seven new districts will divide the Nagas' ancestral areas.
 
 Joykishan blamed the Centre for ignoring the grave situation in Manipur caused by the ongoing economic blockade. He said the council can no longer be termed as a civil organisation taking into account the sufferings of the people due to the blockade and violence meted out to truckers and passengers by UNC volunteers on national highways. He added that the state unit of BJP would support them to declare the Naga body as an unlawful organisation. 
 
 Joykishan demanded an explicit reply from the Centre. Chief minister   had earlier said UNC is the mouthpiece of NSCN(IM).
