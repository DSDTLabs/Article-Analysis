GUWAHATI: Two of the prime accused in the   cash-for-job scam are still at large,   said in a status report submitted before a court here. 

 The two accused who have eluded capture till now are Rajib Paul, brother of former APSC chairperson Rakesh Paul who is key accused in the case, and a suspended police official Rakesh Gupta. Rajib, accused of printing fake APSC answer scripts at his private printing press, is suspected to have left the country and believed to have taken shelter in Nepal. Gupta has been absconding since the investigating team started arresting government officials who have been accused of securing their jobs by bribing Rakesh.
 
 Dibrugarh Police, in the status report, said the investigation has been taking the right direction and police need more time to finish it. "A fresh set of forensic report of answer scripts, suspected to have irregularities, will be received soon and more arrests are expected shortly. Investigation has been going in the right direction and should reach its logical end within a couple of months," sources said.
 
 On Friday, police had filed its fourth charge sheet in the case, in which it accused   and Manas Pratim Haloi (both arrested in February) of resorting to illegal means for selection in the APSC. Pincha and Haloi were working as superintendents of taxes in Dhubri and   district respectively.
 
 Sources added that over 20 answer scripts sent for forensic tests recently have found handwriting irregularities. Police added that if the test results confirm of irregularities, several officials - including a few believed to be close to high profile politicians - may found themselves in trouble.
