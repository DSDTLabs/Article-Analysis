GANDHINAGAR:   BJP has planned a massive campaign centred on smartphones to reach out to voters for the 2017 assembly elections. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had advised the state BJP to make the mobile phone its tool to connect with voters.

  president Amit Shah also had long meetings with BJP’s social media team and senior leaders of the party’s state unit during his last two visits to Gujarat. He had discussed a detailed social media plan for the upcoming elections. 
 
 A source privy to the development said the BJP will soon open a ‘2017 election war room’, where a team of some 100 trained workers will work round-the-clock and send information to workers on social media.
 
 The party has decided to engage some 21 lakh active social media workers who will be trained in the use of WhatsApp and other platforms to connect with voters for the 2017 elections. 
 
 A senior BJP leader involved in the campaign plan said that in 2012 the party had   and 3D technology-based virtual public rallies.
 
 “This time the party has decided to use smartphones as the tool of choice to reach out to voters,” the BJP leader said. “The party has detailed records of 97 lakh persons, of which 21 lakh are active workers of the party and are currently working at some 47,000 booths (45 to 50 per booth). These workers will soon be trained as WhatsApp group administrators.” 
 
 Each of these group administrators will make 100 or more members. “The party will disseminate to WhatsApp group members information about the Union government and the state government’s pro-people work and decisions,” the BJP leader said. “Daily messages on nationalism, and information about the corruption and wrongdoings of   and other parties, will be sent.”
 
 Besides WhatsApp, all social media workers will also be trained in the use of Twitter and Facebook, the BJP leader said.
