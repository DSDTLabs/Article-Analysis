AHMEDABAD: After spending close to Rs 22 lakh of   on installing floodlights for an all-municipal corporation night   on Thursday at SP Stadium, a fire in the floodlight circuitry on the mast caused many bulbs to burn out. Besides this, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( ), which spent close to a few lakhs on sponsoring sportswear for various participating   from across the state could not manage a sports gear for its own team.

  While AMC’s streetlight department and the SP Stadium management claim that there were just a few old bulbs that burned out, TOI saw a snorkel platform of the fire department raised to the mast to extinguish fire in the floodlights. Smoke continued to billow out from the mast for quite some time before the fire was put out. 
 
 “There were just three bulbs that went off and these were not the new bulbs that we had installed,” claimed a senior AMC official. As far as the sportswear goes, while many received their team jerseys, AMC had asked its team to wear a white shirt and brown pants till their team jerseys arrived.
