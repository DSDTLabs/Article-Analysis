TRICHY: Appearing before the state human rights commission as part of its inquiry into the death of his wife Usha who died after falling from his bike, her husband D Raja alleged on Wednesday that attempts were being made to save the accused inspector,   from the case. 

 Minutes before deposing before   inquiry officer, DSP N  , at circuit house in Trichy, Raja told reporters that his wife died of head injury sustained after inspector Kamaraj kicked his bike on which she was riding pillion. “The kick by the inspector was the reason for her death. The police are trying to save him from the case. The chief minister also read out a report of the police without finding out the truth. So, we have sought a CBI inquiry in the court,” said Raja adding that he was asked over phone to appear for the inquiry.
 
 Usha, a resident of   near Papanasam in Thanjavur, met with the fatal end after traffic inspector Kamaraj, attached to Trichy rural police, chased and kicked the bike on which she was riding pillion with her husband D Raja, 34 near Ganesha roundabout opposite BHEL quarters on March 7. 
 
 Raja also denied reports which said he was drunk when the incident happened. “If I was drunk, why didn’t the police confirm it with a medical test. The police are deliberately spreading false news,” said Raja. The officer is understood to have asked him about the chronicle of events and to give his statement in writing. It was the second day of sitting by the commission. On Tuesday, the commission had conducted an inquiry with seven police officers and visited the spot where the incident occurred. Raja also expressed disappointment at the delay in providing him the solatium of Rs 7 lakh announced by the state government.
