THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The talks over the re-entry of Kerala   (Mani) leader K M   into the United Democratic Front (UDF) fold has now triggered severe unrest within the Congress party , one of the constituents of the front .The attempt made by Congress leader   and IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty to bring Mani back to their front has been opposed by the majority of the leaders.

 Now, the `I' in the Congress has come out against the mo ve. It feels that the latest move is to field Jose K Mani, Mani's son and MP, once again from Kottayam in the next Lok Sabha election on UDF ticket.
 
 The leaders said both the   and Kottayam district congress committee ( ) had passed a resolution stating that Mani should not be taken back to the UDF. This resolution was passed after the UDF lost the Kottayam district panchayat as the   ress (Mani) switched over to the LDF camp.
 
 â€œOnly a section of the Congress wants to bring back Mani. We expected this before the next Lok Sabha election since Mani wants his son to be get elected from Kottayam again. But this time the sentiments of the Congress workers in Kottayam is against Kerala Congress (Mani) and they are not allowing to accept the party any more in the UDF,'' said a senior `I' group leader.
 
 The party headed by Mani had openly supported P K Kunhalikutty in the Malappuram Lok Sabha bypoll and he is likely to pledge the support to the IUML candidate in the Vengara assembly bypoll too. The IUML, with the support of Chandy , is spearheading the lobbying to bring back Mani into the UDF fold.
 
 But the Congress leaders in Kottayam, including those belong to `A' group, have expressed their displeasure over the move to Chandy , the group leader. They have made it clear they would not support any such move.
