NOIDA: The old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 have been rendered useless in the new year, but this has created a new problem for police department as they don't know what to do with the disputed cash seized in different criminal cases. There are 22 police stations in Noida and Greater Noida and nearly Rs 1.6 crore of old currency notes are kept in different storehouses(maalkha na). 

 These currencies have been recovered from criminals involved in cases of robbery, financial frauds, thefts, snatchings, etc. Since the date of depositing old currency notes in banks have passed, the police officers are in a fix.
 
 Dinesh Yadav, SP (city) said that the seized currency and property becomes court property. 
 
 "On court order, the seized property and cash is given to its owner. We will seek court advice about disposal of these currency notes," he said. However, the court may take time in delivering the verdict depending on the nature of the case.
 
 Lalit Mudgal, special prosecution officer (SPO),  , said that in some cases like abduction where a kidnapper has been held with the ransom amount, there is no counterclaim of the seized cash and valuables, other than that of the complainant. In such cases, it is easier for the court to hand over the cash to the real owner.
 
 "However, cash and property become disputed when a robber has been held but the real owner of the seized property has not been identified. In this case, the cash is deposited in state exchequer on court order," Mudgal added. 
 
 Officials also said that the orders were also delayed as courts were closed for a few days in December. "We have also sought directions from the state government, if the seized cash can be deposited at the RBI offices that are accepting   till March 31," Mudgal said.
