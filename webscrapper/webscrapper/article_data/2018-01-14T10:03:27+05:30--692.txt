MOHALI: The political unrest in Mohali municipal corporation (MC) has raised the hopes of   councillors to secure a berth of senior deputy mayor.   (BJP) councillors collectively have written a letter to mayor and the   commissioner, sighting senior deputy mayor's seat. 

 The action came after Punjab local bodies minister issued a show-cause notice to mayor   and   councillors withdrew their support to Mayor Kulwant Singh. It was in the recent MC house meet during the call for signing a resolution against the show-cause notice orders that all the Congress councillors along with one Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor did not vote in favour of the resolution.
 
 The SAD dismissed councillor B B Maini from the party, and the very next day Maini joined Congress.
 
 The unrest has also provoked some of the SAD councillors already in opposition to Kulwant Singh to come out in the open against him. Sources said the opposition against Kulwant Singh came when he contested MC election from Azaad group and won the mayor's seat with support of Congress councillors. During the Mayor elections, SAD-BJP councillors did not vote for Kulwant Singh.
 
 Now, after the Congress councillors refused to vote for resolution against the show-cause notice, the house may go in for proving majority.
 
 Sources said, "If the house goes in for proving majority for Kulwant Singh, some of the SAD councillors will not vote in his favour. Kulwant Singh, as a result, may have to step down from the chair."
 
 BJP councillors have already shown their opposition by opting for the senior deputy mayor's chair.
