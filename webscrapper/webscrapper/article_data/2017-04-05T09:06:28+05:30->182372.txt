MADURAI: A one-year-old boy, who was admitted to   for fever, has gone missing. Police suspect that it was a case of kidnap and launched a search for the boy. 

 Police identified the missing boy as O Premkumar, son of Ondimuthu and Deviga. The couple’s elder son Prakash, 3, was also hospitalised.
 
 Police said Deviga, who took care of the children all day on Monday, needed some rest and went home. She entrusted with her mother the task of taking care of the children. While the elderly woman slept on the floor, the children slept on the bed. 
 
 When the grandmother woke up on Tuesday morning, she found Premkumar missing. Others in the ward too did not see the boy. She informed the child’s parents, who in turn approached the   town police.
 
 Police sources said a middle aged woman admitted to the same hospital, who had often spoken to the boy and the family members, was also missing. Police suspect that the woman might have involved in the kidnap.
 
 Madurai district superintendent of police A Saravanan said they had got some concrete clues in the incident and working based on them.
