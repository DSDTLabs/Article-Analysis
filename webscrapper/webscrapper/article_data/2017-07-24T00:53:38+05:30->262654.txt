NEW DELHI: Almost two decades after an accident claimed the life of a 23-year-old youth, a Delhi   has upheld the punishment given to the bus   observing the his act had “snuffed a life even before it could bloom properly”. 

 District and sessions judge Dr Asha Menon, however, reduced his sentence from a year to six months considering the prolonged trial. “With regard to the quantum of punishment, certainly, this is not a case calling for probation,” the court observed.
 
 The accident had taken place on September 5, 1997 when the victim was getting off a bus in south Delhi and the   negligently drove the bus ahead. The victim, Puran Chand, fell down and was crushed under the bus’s rear wheels. A magistrate court had in 2015 sentenced the driver Ramesh Chand to a year in   for the death of Chand and another six months for rash driving. 
 
 The driver appealed against his conviction arguing that his negligence was not established. The prosecution, however, argued that testimonies of two eye witnesses had established the negligence of the appellant in driving the bus and causing the death of Puran Chand. Hence, it was submitted that the trial court had rightly convicted the appellant and the punishment awarded was also appropriate. 
 
 The court, however, reduced the one-year jail term to six months imprisonment, noting that the accused has faced a long trial. The driver’s conviction was upheld under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.
