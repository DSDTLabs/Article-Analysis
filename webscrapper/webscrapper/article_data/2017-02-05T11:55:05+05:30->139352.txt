RANCHI: Former chief minister and   (Prajatantrik)   has sought CBI probe into the matter of Tata's subleasing its land to few select companies and industrialists without approval of the government. The matter has been pointed out by CAG in its recent report in which Tata along with   (DVC) have been accused of collectively depriving state exchequer of revenue worth Rs 3,376.24 crore by means of issuing sublease of its land to various parties without informing the state government. 

 Addressing media at a joint press conference here, Marandi and JVM-P general secretary   accused successive BJP governments of patronising alleged 'corrupt practices' of Tata. 
 
 "Tata had acquired 12,708 acre land on lease from the government in 1956, lease agreement of which expired in 1995 but the company applied for renewal of 10,852 acres in 2005 during Arjun Munda government," Marandi said pointing to certain conditions that the Munda government had then finalised for the Tata to follow. 
 
 During renewal of the lease Tata representatives had agreed to give Rs 25 crore every year towards funding health insurance for BPL families and in addition dole out Rs 150 crore for the 34th National Games that was hosted by Jharkhand. Marandi had said that at the rate of Rs 25 crore per year, Tata should have given Rs 300 crore during the last 12 years, but not a penny was paid to the government. 
 
 Marandi said that the matter of renewal of lease agreement came before him when he was the chief minister in 2000-2002 but he refused because of the discrepancies involved. "Someone having land on lease from government cannot sublease it to others and under those circumstances the renewal was not possible," he said, mentioning the appeal submitted by representatives of Chaibasa Chamber of Commerce to the governor demanding probe into the matter of Tata giving land on sublease to industrialists. 
 
 "Member revenue board in his investigation found as many as 30 parties, to whom land was given on sublease by Tata, to be illegal," Marandi said requesting CBI probe.
