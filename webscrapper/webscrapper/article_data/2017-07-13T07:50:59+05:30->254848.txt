 Within 15 moves Deshmukh saw his position tumbling. As a fighter the LIC Employee tried a handful of variations to bring parity in the game but was forced to resign after the 40th move.
 
 "I badly wanted to win but my young opponent was very well prepared for my style. He outplayed me today," Deshmukh told TOI from Spain admitting his defeat.
 
 He added, "rom the white side I had success twice with the English Opening. Today too I opted for the same opening but Diaz came prepared and was quick to reply. I should have changed my opening. By the 15th move my position was already lost."
 
 "With a hope to secure half point by sharing the points I managed to stretch the game by playing several moves but he played the end part very good and won the game in 40 moves," Deshmukh said.
 
 With this 8th round defeat Deshmukh might not be able to gain enough rating points and will now hope to finish his second tournament with a win on Thursday. In the final round, Deshmukh will defend with the black pieces against higher ranked Abhishek Das on the 17th board.
