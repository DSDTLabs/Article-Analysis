JAIPUR: Forty-one infants died per 1,000 live births in the state in 2016 even before celebrating their first birthday.

 Sample Registration System (SRS) Bulletin 2016 report issued by the Centre in September shows that   in the state remained at 41 deaths per 1,000 live births. Comparing it with SRS 2015 figures, the state reported decline of two infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
 
 According to SRS 2015, there were 43 infants who had died per 1,000 live births in the state. Birth asphyxia, low birth weight, infection, diarrhoea, typhoid and hypothermia are leading causes of deaths of infants in the state. Recently, Banswara's sick newborn care unit (SNCU) had reported 90 deaths in July and August. Majority of the infants who had died were born with low birth weight.
 
 Principal secretary (health) Veenu Gupta said, the Infant Mortality Rate ( ) in the state has taken a dip by two points. It was 49 per 1,000 live births in 2012, it further reduced to 47 in 2013, it went down to 46 in 2014 and in 2015, it was recorded at 43 deaths per 1,000 live births.
 
 In five years (from 2012 to 2016), the IMR in the state has decreased from 49 to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births.
 
 Health department officials said that to prevent deaths from the five leading causes of mortality of infants, the health department has set up 53 sick newborn care units (SNCU). These SNCUs are equipped with radiant warmer, phototheraphy machine, syringe infusion pump, pulse oxymeter. These SNCUs provide treatment to infants who are under 28 days. In these SNCU, the health department claimed that they have employed trained staff, which effectively provides treatment to infants suffering from birth asphyxia, low birth weight, infection, diarrhoea, typhoid and hypothermia.
 
 Besides, the health department also pointed out immunization against fatal diseases has also helped the health authorities in bringing down IMR by two points in the state.Gupta said that the health workers administer vaccines contain protection from nine different kinds of diseases diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Hib, polio, diarrhoea, measles and rota virus.
 
 She said that 83% of children are fully vaccinated. Under mission Indradhanush, the health workers are covering those children who are not fully immunised.
 
 
 
 
 A drop in the infant mortality rate (IMR) is a welcome development for Rajasthan. Despite the fact that the state government is basking in the glory of the recent achievement, it yet has a long ground to cover. Efforts are needed to further improve the neo-natal healthcare facilities and bring down the IMR. Rajasthan is among the five states with an IMR higher than 40. Of these,   (IMR 47), Assam (44) and Uttar Pradesh (43) have recorded a drop of three points while Odisha (44) and Rajasthan (41) have recorded a drop of only two. The infant mortality rate nationally is 34 per 1,000 babies, which the centre hopes to bring down to 28 in the next two years. IMR in states like Kerala and   stands at 10 and 17 respectively. A better implementation and monitoring of existing programmes will help the cause. It is yet not time to celebrate.
