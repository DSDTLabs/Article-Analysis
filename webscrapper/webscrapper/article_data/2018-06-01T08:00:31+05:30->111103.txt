AHMEDABAD: Crime branch sleuths on Thursday arrested four women, Hansa Dantaniya of Vasna, Radha Dantaniya of Navrangpura, Usha Dantaniya of Paldi and   of Vadaj for committing house break-ins in the city.

 Crime branch claims to have cracked two such house break-ins in Satellite and Naranpura areas and have recovered stolen jewellery and cash, worth Rs 2.38 lakh from them.
 
 Officials said the women would roam about in the city as rag-pickers and identify locked houses. “The gang then used to break into the locked houses and decamp with valuables and cash,” said a crime branch official. Inspector R S Suvera of crime branch said that out of the four arrested, two, Hansa and Radha have a criminal history.
