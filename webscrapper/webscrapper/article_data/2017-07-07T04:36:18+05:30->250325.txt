NEW DELHI: Noting a lack of affordable and quality school education for children from minority communities, a panel set up by ministry for minority affairs has recommended setting-up of 211 central schools on the lines of   and   in minority-concentration districts. 

  The committee under   and led by   was set up in December to chalk out a detailed roadmap for educational empowerment of the minorities. 
 
 The cost of each school has been worked out by the panel at Rs 20 crore and annual operational cost of Rs 3 crore. It has been suggested that the schools may have timings starting from 9.30 am to allow students to also attend madrasas or pathshalas before they come to school. 
 
 In order to check dropout after school, the panel has also recommended setting up of 25 community colleges in different states in minority-concentration districts. These colleges will provide degree courses and skill certification to enable students to plan their livelihood. 
 
  Minority affairs minister   is expected to hold a meeting to decide on the future course of action to implement the report. 
 
 It has been recommended that five national-level institutes should be set up to cater to specialised education in the fields of science and technology, health and allied sciences, architecture planing and design, climate change and disaster management and renewable energy and food security.
 
 The panel cited 2001 and 2011 Census figures to point out how Muslims particularly lagged behind in education and skill development.
 
 "If we consider literacy rate, enrolment rates, mean years of schooling and differential in higher education of all minorities, we find that Muslims are the most disadvantaged," says the report. 
 
 “The literacy rates among Muslims in 2001 was 59.1% and in 2011 it was 68.53% against the national average of 64.8% and 72.98% respectively.
 
 The difference in enrolment rate between Muslims and the remaining population is also sharp,” it said.
