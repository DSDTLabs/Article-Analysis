BENGALURU: Ace Indian golfer   opened with a gritty even-par 72 to occupy the tied 42nd spot in the LPGAANA Inspiration, the first of the five Majors for women, at the   (  course) in Rancho Mirage, California, on Thursday.

 Aditi, who dropped two shots in the first three holes, recovered to stay in the mix, five shots behind leader   of France. Fifty-one players were yet to complete the round after the first round was suspended due to high winds. Playing her first event in America, Aditi, who turned 19 two days ago, missed two short putts on the 10th hole, her first, and the 12th. However, the   put the two setbacks behind by holing two long putts, a monstrous 40-footer on the 13th and a 20-footer on the 15th hole.
