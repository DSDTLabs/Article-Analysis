A train was approaching fast and he could not get up due to the weight of the bicycle. Soon I took the bicycle and schoolbag. I tried to pull him out of the track but couldn't. So I kicked Abhijit off the track and the train passed without touching us. But my right hand was fractured in the incident," said Sebastian Vincent recalling the incident.
