AHMEDABAD: As you ride on the  , one of the widest in the city, it’s not uncommon to come across the   from the previous night. One can easily recognize the  ,  , a pile-up, hit and run, brakes slammed hard leading to skidding, side swiped, rearended collision, losing control — your visual vocabulary of accidents is bound to get richer. Well, a lot of these accidents could have been avoided and precious lives saved if a few “mundane” rules were followed!

 Road safety research team of JP India Ltd analyzed 211 accidents, 88 of which were fatal, and found that almost 52% of the accidents on SG Road were related to poor road user behaviour, which also includes pedestrians and cyclists.
 
 There were 42% of accidentscausedby over speeding and 18% accidents caused by plain distractions — talking on phone or conversing with other passengers inside vehicles.
 
 Among accidents that involved poor road user behaviour, the violation of right of way constituted the largest number of accidents 13%, while 7% accidents were due to improper lane change. When it came to overspeeding, nearly 16% involved cars, while in case of accidents related to not paying attention, nearly 13% accidents were caused due to distractions and misjudgements.
 
 “The study has claimed that most accidents on SG Road could have been avoided if one road user allowed the other a right of way. Violation of right of way is a situation where a road user unintentionally or deliberately fails to yield way (give way) to another road user,” says a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official in the traffic department.
