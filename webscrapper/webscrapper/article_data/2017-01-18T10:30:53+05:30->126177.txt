After dating for two years, stand-up comedienne   and  , writer of her show Comedy Nights Bachao had a roka ceremony on Sunday. It was an intimate affair that was attended by close friends and family.
 
  Informs a guest, “The roka ceremony was followed by a party at a restaurant in Andheri. It was a last minute decision as everything was organised overnight.Among their industry friends, the invite was extended to only a handful, including Krushna Abhishek and Kashmera Shah, producer Vipul D Shah and a few crew members of the comedy show. Krushna was the first to hit the dance floor. He even dragged Bharti and Haarsh. The trio danced the night away .“
  
  
 
  
  Bharti and Haarsh plan to tie the knot sometime in November this year. They will apparently also be seen participating in the couple dance reality show Nach Baliye. The couple, however, didn't respond to our calls.
