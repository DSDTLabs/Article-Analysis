Patiala: Support from war   has started pouring in for LSR student   whose social media campaign against ABVP drew a volley of hate messages on her Facebook account.

 Punjab State Ex-Servicemen Welfare Association (Sewa) has stepped forward to fight a legal battle on her behalf. Other war veterans have also voiced their concerns against “rape threats” issued to the daughter of Kargil   Captain Mandeep Singh.
 
 Col Kuldip Singh Grewal (retd), Sewa president, said they would fight for Kaur and see to it that a formal complaint against the hate messages is lodged. “We will make certain that the case is filed and taken to its logical conclusion,” he said.
 
 Col Grewal, a 1971 India-Pakistan war veteran, said it was shameful that the daughter of a Kargil martyr was being threatened with rape. “All daughters of the country should be respected, especially of the   men who fought for the country and laid down their lives. Gurmehar’s opinion should have been respected as she has the right to raise her voice,” Col Grewal said.
 
 Col Tejinder Singh Bajwa (retd), another 1971 war veteran, said the countrymen should raise their voice in unison to protect the daughter of a martyr. No one should remain unaffected when a daughter is threatened with rape, he said.
 
 “What sort of example is being set by the frontrunners of this generation? It is highly condemnable and should be disapproved of by all in one single voice,” said Brig Balwant Singh Tejey (retd).
