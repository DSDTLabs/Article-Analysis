GHAZIABAD: A 22-year-old Sikkim resident has covered 1,500km from Gangtok to Ghaziabad on foot to spread awareness about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s   campaign. Abhishek Prasad Gupta, who started his solo marathon on December 29, will end his run at Sikkim Bhawan in Delhi after covering around 30km more. His journey was flagged off Sikkim governor Shriniwas Patil. Gupta said he had been   at a slow pace for around 70-80km every day. He is being accompanied by his father Shankar Prasad and a medical team that has been following them in a SUV.

 Between Gangtok and Ghaziabad, Gupta met residents of several districts in West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Besides the Swachh Bharat campaign, Gupta is giving voice to the ‘Organic Sikkim’ campaign of the northeastern state and the fight against child abuse. “All three causes are close to my heart. On my way, I am meeting people and talking about these issues. I am also visiting police stations and taking signatures of officers present there as a proof of my run,” Gupta said. A diploma holder in mechanical engineering, Gupta had been working with a private firm but left the job last year March.
