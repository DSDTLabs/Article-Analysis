AHMEDABAD : He is a   by profession but   is better known as ‘Chakliwala’ for his passion to save sparrows and bringing the humble bird back to the cityscape. Kinkhabwala has distributed over 50,000 nests to date, and over 4,500 of those have become homes for the birds. But on eve of World  , Kinkhabwala speaks about the larger issue at hand.

  “Past generations might have grown up on sparrow songs and might have seen the sparrows at work behind those old photographs or on a ledge in the roof but the current generation doesn’t have that luxury,” said Kinkhabwala. “Save the Sparrow is also a campaign to save the environment as the plight of the birds points towards a larger issue,” he added.
 
 Experts point towards factors such as mobile radiation, less and less space in modern homes for birds to nest and environmental factors. 
 
 “I keep track of the nesting through the calls and messages I receive from across the state and beyond. I have examples where families have made sweets when the first bird arrived in the corrugated nests,” said Kinkhabwala.
 
 “People put water outside their homes and also put in feed for the birds it’s an inherent practice in our culture to sustain our ecosystem,” he said, “But it is also about planting trees, reducing all sorts of pollution and making environmental conditions better not only for the birds but for all living beings.”
 
 Kinkhabwala says that the sparrows have returned in areas such as Paldi, Juhapura, Shahpur and Shyamal crossroads.

 Sparrows, an integral part of the childhood of most citizens, are now fast disappearing. The current generation of children rarely see the birds which were once a common sight in residences. Experts say this is not reflective of only one specific bird species vanishing, but of the environment coming under attack. Apart from intervention by voluntary organizations, it is time the state agencies stepped in and devised a plan to conserve the state's vulnerable fauna.
