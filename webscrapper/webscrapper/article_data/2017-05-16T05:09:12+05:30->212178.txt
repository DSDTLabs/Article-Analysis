NEW DELHI: Sacked AAP minister   ended his indefinite hunger strike on Monday and said he would move   and   to file corruption cases against CM  . Mishra had been fasting for the past six days to seek details of foreign travels undertaken by senior AAP functionaries — Sanjay Singh, Ashish Khetan, Satyendar Jain, Raghav Chadha and   — in the past two years. 

 “I have started taking liquid because doctors said I will not be discharged from hospital unless I break my fast,” he said. Mishra was admitted to RML Hospital after he fainted during a press conference at his residence on Sunday where he alleged that crores of black money was funnelled into AAP’s coffers through shell companies and fake donors. Doctors said he was suffering from dehydration and weakness due to long period of fast.
 
 “On Tuesday, I will lodge a case of hawala, black money, money laundering and operations through shell companies with CBI and Central Board of Direct Taxes against Kejriwal,” Mishra said. He has rejected AAP’s allegations that he was acting at the behest of BJP. 
 
 “People who love black money cannot understand the language of satyagraha. The foundation of lies has shaken. People who have been exposed are sitting inside their houses,” he said after breaking his fast.
 
 Meanwhile, AAP’s Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha claimed that allegations levelled against Kejriwal were baseless. “I am sad that you (Mishra) lied at Raj Ghat because you have not yet disclosed when you went to the CM’s residence on May 5,” Jha said on Twitter.
 
 On May 13, Jha had launched a counter-fast, demanding to know from Mishra as to when he had gone to Kejriwal’s residence where he allegedly saw the CM taking Rs 2 crore from Satyendar Jain. 
 
 AAP functionaries claim CCTVs installed at the CM’s residence did not capture Mishra’s arrival on May 5. “Jha will continue his indefinite fast till Mishra tells him when he visited Kejriwal’s residence,” an aide of Jha said.
