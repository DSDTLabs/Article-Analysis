JAIPUR:   may have recorded major gains in the   but has recorded   in some major Right to Education Act indicators. An   says that number of schools meeting pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) fell from 66.6% in 2014 to 65.2% in 2016. The   in Rajasthan had mandated that PTR should be 30:1. However, the overall picture is way beyond the set rule.

 It is also important to note that aggregate figures are much better than the national average of 53% meeting the PTR. Experts have attributed the negative growth in these parameters to delay in hiring of teachers. The report also revealed that 78% of rural schools in the state in 2016 met the classroom-teacher ratio (CTR), compared to the figure of 82.1% schools meeting the same criteria in 2010.
 
 “The rise in enrollments in government schools has impacted both PTR and CTR. Another reason for this is recruitment of teaching staff pending at several levels,” said K B Kothari, managing trustee of Pratham NGO. CTR is further impacted due integration or merger of schools wherein relatively poor infrastructure schools were merged into bigger schools reducing the number of classrooms. The education department claimed that state scheme of making it compulsory for 40,000 BEd students to teach at government schools have neutralized the PTR. 
 
 State also boasts of having country’s biggest government schools due to availability of land in abundance. Some schools are spread in acres of land having huge playgrounds. Data reveals that 64.6% schools have playground which is close to the national average, however, going by the abundance of land in the state the figure is miserable. Government officials have claimed that state would lead the country in terms of having highest number of playgrounds. 
 
 “The work in hundreds of playgrounds is being done under MGNREGA funds. By the end of next year, Rajasthan will be leading in the country on this front,” said senior education department officer.
