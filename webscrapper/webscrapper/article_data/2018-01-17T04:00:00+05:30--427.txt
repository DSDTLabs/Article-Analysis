Surat: Crime branch sleuths of city police arrested three persons from Amroli Sayan Road on Tuesday for allegedly cheating women posing as sales agents of a company manufacturing a metal shining liquid and escaping with their gold jewellery.

 Police recovered stolen jewellery and a motorcycle worth Rs 2.78 lakh from Mukesh Kailash Kesri (28), Vikas alias Vicky Gupta (30) and Sunny Naresh Kansara (24), who had cheated many people similarly in Uttar Pradesh, too, in the past.
 
 Police recovered eight gold bangles and a pair of gold earrings from the accused, who were currently living at Manjur village in Nadiad. They confessed to police of having cheated a woman living on A K Road of her four bangles on January 11. 
 
 The burglars went to a residence in Pushpak Society and offered to hold a demonstration for a woman of a metal shining liquid made for utensils, which could also be used to shine jewellery. They applied the liquid on the bangles that the woman was wearing. The woman developed an itching sensation and the accused asked her to remove the bangles and keep them in a pan of water. They asked the woman to heat the water on gas and added some liquid and turmeric powder to it. 
 
 The water’s colour on gas changed and the accused then asked the woman to get them some water to drink. 
 
 The woman returned with water for them and the accused soon left saying that they will return after holding a similar demonstration in a neighbouring house. They asked her to let the water boil for some time. However, the accused never returned and had escaped with the woman’s bangles. They confessed to the police that the other four bangles and a pair of earrings were that of a woman of Nandan Nagari in Uttar Pradesh.
