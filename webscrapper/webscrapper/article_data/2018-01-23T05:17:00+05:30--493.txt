 Chennai: Unlike their transport department counterparts, whose demand for wage hike is yet to be settled, TNEB employees had arrived at an agreement with the management for an overall salary increase of 2.57%. But, the board management is awaiting orders from the government to formally announce the wage hike. 
 
 The agreement is said to have been signed between the management and various TENEB workers’ unions in December last year. But, the government is not ready to allow the management to formally announce the hike pending a settlement with regard to transport workers. On January 11, the Madras high court appointed a retired judge to act as arbitrator between the government and striking transport workers, following which they had called off their strike. 
 
 Soon after the signing of agreement, banners and posters with pictures of AIADMK union leaders thanking TNEB chairman M Saikumar appeared outside the board headquarters. It has since been removed. 
 
 “Talks went on for nearly a year on various issues put forth by the unions, including the rate of pay hike, the date from which new wages will have to be given effect and filling up of vacancies. After much deliberation, the unions and management came to an agreement on 2.57% and on other issues,” said a senior TNEB official, seeking anonymity. 
 
 The government first asked the TNEB management to wait till the end of R K Nagar byelection as the model code was in effect. “We expected the government to give its approval by December-end. But, that was not to be. Pongal was the next date. We thought we will be allowed to announce it, but by then transport strike crippled the state. Now, we are not sure of the date as the transport arbitration is on,” said the official.
