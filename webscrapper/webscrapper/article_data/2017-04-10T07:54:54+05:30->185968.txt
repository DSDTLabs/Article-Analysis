SILCHAR: BJP national general secretary   on Sunday said the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, which is being studied by the  , will be passed in   before the 2019   election. 

 "BJP government at the Centre is committed to pass the bill and make it an act with an aim to make refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians eligible for Indian citizenship. There's no doubt that the bill will be passed without further delay and it will become an act well before the next general election," he said.
 
 Addressing the media, Vijayvargiya said AGP - the partner of the BJP government in Assam- will have to support the bill. "But, we will not bother if anybody opposes the bill. If any party wants to ally with BJP, it will have to follow the policies and strategies of the pary. If they do so, they will be allowed to stay with BJP,'' said Vijayvargiya.
 
 Vijayvargiya said infiltration from neighbouring countries over the years has changed the demography of the nation and Assam. It has affected the social structure to a large extent. He said it's BJP's responsibility to give shelter and grant citizenship to the minorities coming from neighouring countries due to religious persecution.
