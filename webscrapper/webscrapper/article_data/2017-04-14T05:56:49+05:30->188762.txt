CHENNAI: "  and   may soon make ICUs a hot bed for infections," he said. 

 Teams from five tertiary care hospitals, each comprising a doctor, nurse, microbiologist, pharmacist and administrator, attended the meeting to draft or improve action plans for the internal stewardship committees.
 
 Antibiotics were " " when created in the middle of the 20th century, and soon formed the bulwark of modern medicine. Over decades, however, bacteria evolved to fight the drugs, particularly due to overuse and abuse in human health and agriculture. Now, experts say, some   have lost their efficacy and the pipeline of new antibiotics has been running dry. Superbugs - resistant to more than one antibiotic - are springing up across the globe, they said.
 
 ICMR epidemiologist Dr Kamini Walia said hospitals have been asked to develop policies to help rationalise use of all antibiotics. While microbiologists will prepare a list of common infections, drug-resistant infections and effective antibiotics based on periodic study, doctors will be asked to pick the 'best bet' drug to treat infections before sending the patient's blood sample for detailed analysis. If the analysis confirms he/she is sensitive to the drug, it can be continued or altered. " The list of antibiotics will vary for hospitals as the infections may be different," she said. 
 
 The ICMR is starting with select 20 tertiary care hospitals across the country. "Soon, we will spread the policy to all hospitals, nursing homes and clinics," she said. 
 
 Apollo Hospitals in Chennai, Christian Medical College, Vellore, JIPMER, Puducherry, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Manipal Hospitals, Mangalore, and Amrita Institute of Medical Science, Kochi attended Thursday's meeting which will be followed by meetings in Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi.
