KOLKATA: The school that issued a   to a 12-year-old rape survivor, who recently gave birth to a baby girl, has been hauled up by at least three organisations.

  While the   for Protection of Child Rights chairperson is in the process of slapping a show cause letter on the school, the Women’s Commission chairperson plans to approach the  . Besides, the   (DLSA) of Howrah has already issued a notice to the school headmistress, while the girl’s family has written to the education minister, seeking help.
 
  The girl and her family alleged the school’s headmistress had humiliated her, accusing her of bringing a "bad name" and forcing her to leave the institute. Not so, the headmistress claimed but the questions she raised revealed concerns about the way society treated a rape survivor. In an earlier report in TOI, the headmistress had said, “Guardians feared she would discuss her ‘sexual exploitation’.... Male teachers fear she may level false allegations of assault against them..."
 
  Women’s panel chairperson Sunanda Mukherjee was shocked: "Society can’t provide security to a girl but wants to ensure she doesn’t get to study. The headmistress is answerable. I will talk to the DM." Ananya Chakraborty, chairperson of commission for protection of child rights, said the school must be pulled up: "It is a violation of child and human rights. The panel will send a show cause notice. We will help reinstate the girl." Prosenjit Bhattacharya, DLSA office master, confirmed a notice was sent. "The headmistress has been asked to appear before us next week," he said. The survivor’s grandfather said he sought a transfer certificate from the school, hoping she would get admission elsewhere. "But no one is ready. I have written to the education minister and trying to meet the CM."
