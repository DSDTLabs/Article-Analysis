CHANDIGARH:   Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday launched his partyâ€™s   from Mehraj in   with a scathing attack against the Badals, vowing to hang them from their heads along with all others guilty of religious sacrilege and drug mafia, even as he dismissed "cowardly Arvind Kejriwal" as someone who "did not have the guts to fight him on the electoral battleground."
 
 Amarinder was addressing a massive rally here after taking the blessings from the 6th Guru Badshah at the Mehraj gurdwara in Rampura Phul, with which he said he had close emotional ties since his family had settled here in 1305 when they first migrated to Punjab from Jaisalmer.
  
 Amarinder said he had decided to fight chief minister Parkash Singh on his home turf of Lambi in order to free Punjab from the clutches of the Akalis, who had been looting the people of the state for the last 10 years.
  
 He also challenged Kejriwal to come and fight him in Lambi if he was really so confident of sweeping the Punjab elections, as he claimed to be. Punjab does not tolerate cowards like the AAP leader, said Captain Amarinder, adding that if left to AAP or the Akalis, Punjab will never be able to restore its lost pride and glory.
  
 Amarinder said he would ensure that "Kejri Kujri" does not succeed in taking over the state, with which he has no connect. Describing Kejriwal as a slimy crook and "a liar" of the first order, Captain Amarinder said AAP was a party of outsiders which was getting outsiders to campaign and coordinate the elections since they did not have any trust or ties with Punjabis.
  
 Amarinder expressed the hope that he would be able to celebrate his birthday on March 11, the day of the counting for the Assembly polls, with a victory. The crowds cheered him on, saying that the entire state would together celebrate the birthday of Captain Amarinder, who, at 75, would become the longest living leader in the state from his generation.
