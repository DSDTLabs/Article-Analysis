NAGPUR: Soon   vehicles used for commercial purposes such as taxis, auto-rickshaws and buses won’t require permits. The road transport ministry is working on this proposal in its bid to push electric vehicles across segments to check air pollution and high dependence on imported crude oil. 

 The ministry has already set a similar model by allowing e-rickshaws to ply without getting permit, though they have to be registered and must meet minimum safety requirement. Sources said while doing away with permits for such vehicles will reduce corruption, the government won’t compromise on security features such as installation of GPS, panic button, CCTV cameras, mandatory insurance and maximum fare they can charge from passengers. In a bid to push electric vehicles for ferrying passenger, Union transport minister   and   chief minister   on Friday launched the country's first multi-modal electric vehicle project in Nagpur.
 
  
  
 A fleet of 200 electric vehicles including taxis, buses and auto-rickshaws will be operated by taxi aggregator Ola. Mahindra and Mahindra has supplied most of these vehicles. “Electric is the future. We are also looking at the possibility of introducing two lakh electric buses. We are also exploring options to get loan at cheaper interest rate including from agencies like Japan’s Soft-Bank Group. They have a green fund,”   said. 
 
 Mahindra and Mahindra CEO   said currently they produce 400-500 electric vehicles every month and the target is to increase it to 800 in the next few months. In next two years, it will increase capacity to 5,000 per month in the next two years. CEO of Ola, Beavis Agarwal said they target to introduce 10 lakh electric vehicles on road. “From now onwards, our policies will be more towards facilitating vehicles that ply on electricity and other alternate fuel than diesel and petrol,” Gadkari said.
