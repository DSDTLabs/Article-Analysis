BENGALURU: In 2011, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( ) mooted a plan to impose   on vehicles left on the roadsides at night. But the plan never took off and remained only on paper.

 As many as 15 lakh vehicles were parked daily on Bengaluru’s roads and pavements, including in residential localities, in 2011. The number might have tripled now. 
 
 Professor M N Sreehari, advisor to the Karnataka government on transportation, says the transportation plan hasn’t been in sync with the change in land use pattern. “While allowing land use changes, particularly in residential areas, the planning and executive authorities should do a scientific assessment of the impact of transportation, traffic flow and parking availability. While illegal commercialization of residential areas is a bane, there’s a problem with the planning of these localities itself,” he says.
 
 Blaming civic agencies, including BBMP, for traffic menace in residential localities, urban analyst Diwakar K says, “Unauthorized constructions in these areas have come up in connivance with political representatives and greedy property owners who want to make most of the growing population and their demands. There are instances in which a parking space on paper ended up to be shop.”
 
 Traffic cops should impose penalty on illegal parking not just on main roads but also in residential areas, says Sreehari. “In many localities, house owners find it difficult to take out their vehicles with cars parked right in front of their gates,” he adds.
 
 A senior BBMP official said that most problems pertaining to illegal parking will be resolved once the parking policy for the city comes into effect. “At present, we are working to implement the policy under which a street parking management system will be put into place along 56 arterial and sub-arterial roads in the central business district. We will also bring effective parking rules for residential areas,’’ he said.
