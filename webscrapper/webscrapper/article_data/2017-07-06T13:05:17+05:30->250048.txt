Barely two months after Dasari Narayana Rao passed away following prolonged illness, news comes in that a biopic on the veteran filmmaker and ex-Union Minister is in the works. Actor and former president of the Film Federation,  , who considered Dasari his guru, has revealed that the scripting is underway and the director will be finalised soon. 

  
 
  While the details are currently sketchy at the moment, sources suggest the biopic will focus on his movie career without touching upon his political journey. 
 
  In January this year, Dasari’s health deteriorated and he spent almost two months in the hospital. After that, he seemed to be recovering and had met megastar Chiranjeevi, Allu Aravind and Mohan Babu who conferred the Allu Ramalingaiah award on him on May 4. However, his condition turned critical soon after and he breathed his last on May 30. 
 
  Dasari, who was regarded as one of Telugu cinema’s most influential, prolific personalities, had 151 films as director and 53 films as producer to his credit. He delivered several blockbusters and critically acclaimed films in his career, especially those on gender and class discrimination issues. Some of his best known works include  ,  ,   and  . He even entered the Limca book of world records for helming maximum number of films — there was a time when he used to direct 10-12 films a year. 
 
  He had announced plans to produce a film starring Pawan Kalyan and a biopic on ex-Tamil Nadu Chief Minister  , but neither took off. 
 
  As far as his political journey was concerned, it was quite brief. He served as Union minister during Congress’ rule. He found himself embroiled in the   when he was named as one of the people who had received bribes from steel baron Naveen Jindal.
