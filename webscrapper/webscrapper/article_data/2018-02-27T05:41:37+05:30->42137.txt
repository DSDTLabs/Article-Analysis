CHENNAI: A group of 3,000 drivers is set to take on corporate   aggregators such as   and   in Chennai. Expected to hit the roads this March, the cab service of the   ( ) will have nearly 1,800 drivers operating in the core city while the rest ply in the suburbs.

 Unlike the case with existing app-based cab aggregators, there will be no surge pricing in OTS taxis, say members of the new entity that is affiliated to the Centre of   ( ). Besides, they promise, there will be no waiting charges or additional hidden charges if a passenger changes the destination point.
 
 Fares will be calculated only based on the total distance travelled which will be flashed on the mobile phone screen after the ride comes to an end. “The idea is to ensure that the passengers are not fleeced and drivers too enjoy the benefits of app-based cab bookings,” said Sampath, one of those behind setting up OTS.
 
 At present, cab aggregators collect 20%-21% of the total earnings of drivers as commission over and above the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In OTS taxis, drivers will be charged only 7% along with 5 % GST towards this head, he said.
 
 “We are currently working on the fare slab to be prepared based on the car model. Until then, after the service is launched, bookings can be made through phone calls. The organisation has approached   for a catchy contact number that is likely to be launched in a couple of days,” Sampath added.
