Vadodara: City-based businessman with interests in hospitality industry was allegedly cheated by a Chennai-based company to the tune of Rs 5.25 lakh. A complaint was lodged by restaurateur Subhash Bhagat, who is building a hotel at Sevasi Road, at Sayajigunj police station on Tuesday evening.

 Bhagat, who currently owns Kabir’s Kitchen Restaurant on RC Dutt Road, told the police in his complaint that he had contacted Welco International Private Limited for his upcoming hotel. Bhagat is developing Kabir Hotel and Spa at Sevasi Road for which he had contacted Nisha, who is managing director of the company, to supply several hotel in July last year.
 
 Police said that Bhagat had initially invited quotation from Nisha, which was around Rs 12.67 lakh. Satisfied with the prices, Bhagat placed the order but was asked by the accused to make an advance payment of half the amount. On September 1 last year, Bhagat transferred Rs 6.25 lakh through RTGS in Nisha’s account. Nisha then sent several things needed in a hotel which were worth Rs 1 lakh, but did not send the remaining order.
 
 Bhagat reminded the accused number of times to dispatch his order, but she kept dilly dallying. Later, Bhagat asked that if his order is not sent then his money should be returned. After waiting for several weeks when neither the money nor the order was sent, Bhagat approached the police.
 
 Bhagat also owns Kabir’s farm and banquets on Sevasi Road which he lets out for wedding and other events.
