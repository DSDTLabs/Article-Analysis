Superstar   took the Twitter world by storm when he joined the micro-blogging site in May 2014 and garnered over 25,000 followers in no time with just one tweet. The ' ' actor, has been using the Twitter handle @superstarrajini and he has more than 4.5 million followers. But with his entry into politics, he is no more a superstar. He has now removed the 'Superstar' tag from his handle and renamed it as @rajinikanth.

 He was given the title 'Superstar' in his film 'Bairavi' directed by M Baskar, which released in 1978. He has been fondly called 'Superstar' ever since and everyone in the film industry aspires to get that tag for themselves. 
 
 Looks like Rajinikanth, who joined   recently, wants to use the same username (rajinikanth) across all the social networking websites, and so has dropped of his 'Superstar' tag on Twitter. 
 
 The first post on Rajinikanth's Instagram page is a still from his blockbuster movie Kabali. The tongue-in-cheek caption of the still reads: "Vannakam! Vandhuten nu sollu! (Tell them that I have arrived). 
 
 Recently, at an event in Chennai, Rajinikanth made an explosive political speech where he addressed criticisms stacked up against him, gave his advice to youngsters and took a jibe at other politicians. He emphasized that he would provide good administration like late chief minister and   founder M G Ramachandran.
