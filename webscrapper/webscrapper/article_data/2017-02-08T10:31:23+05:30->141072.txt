LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party's (SP) women power will augment the party's election campaign on Wednesday with   addressing her first public meeting in Agra along with the party’s Rajya Sabha member   on Wednesday. In the first leg of their campaign, the two will address public meetings for three women candidates of the party contesting from different seats in Agra district.

 Both Dimple and Jaya Bachchan have earlier figured as the only women leaders in the SP to have figured in the list of party's star campaigners released last week. In her public meetings, while Dimple, party sources said, will focus on her husband and UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's initiatives for women by highlighting schemes like Samajwadi pension, scholarships for girl students and women powerline meant exclusively to ensure police help to women in distress. 
 
 "She has also prepared to showcase the schemes that the party has promised to offer to women if the SP forms the government,” said a senior party leader who is assisting Dimple in her election campaign. The Kannauj MP is expected to talk about the free pressure scheme for housewives and extension of the pension scheme for women which will cover 1 crore destitute with an increased monthly financial assistance of Rs 1,000 instead of Rs 500 that was being given out by the ruling SP government so far.
 
 At the same time, cine star and party MP in the Upper House Jaya Bachchan, in her address, is likely to focus on the opposition parties and their claims of doles for women in their election manifestos and how the BJP-led NDA at the Centre and previous BSP regime in UP have failed to address the woes of the women in the state. 
 
 The two will address the first public meeting at around noon in Bah assembly constituency seeking votes for party candidate Anshu Rani Nishad, followed by rallies at Etmadpur and Agra Cantonment to support party candidates Rajabeti Devi and Mamta Taplu respectively.
