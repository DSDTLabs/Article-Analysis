MUMBAI: Thousands of   will take up the task to spread awareness of noise pollution due to excessive honking by motorists. The drivers, with transport authorities and non-profit organisation  ,will drive a rickshaw to the city with a message to reduce honking.

 “Rickshaw drivers are exposed to honking from all sources as they do not have doors to protect them. We wanted to let citizens know that this is unacceptable. We need to stop honking and today a lot of people pledged the same,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener of Awaaz Foundation.
 
 The ‘Horn Vrat’ campaign was launched at Gateway of India on Saturday. Also taking the oath was state transport secretary Manoj Saunik. 
 
 For the next few days, rickshaw drivers from across the city have volunteered to drive around the message-spreading vehicle for a day. “Since our members are most affected, we thought it was our turn to start doing something. Our drivers have also taken the pledge to not honk and we will put up stickers on our vehicles too,” said Thambi Kurien of Mumbai Rickshawmen Union which has over 9,000 members. 
 
 “We want everyone to take a selfie with the rickshaw and create awareness of effects of honking,” said Abdulali.
