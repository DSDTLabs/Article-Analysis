CHENNAI: The office of Attorney-General of India must be privileged to have senior counsel   in the post, and not the vice versa, was the unanimous opinion of judges, former judges, advocates, both young and old, who had gathered to felicitate the 15th attorney-general of India.

 “By accepting the office at the age of 86, Venugopal has taught us a lesson that age is no bar for great persons. I personally feel proud to hold the office of the chief justice of Madras high court when you are the attorney-general,” said Chief Justice  . She was addressing a gathering organised by   (MBA) on Friday to felicitate Venugopal.
 
 The ace jurist, accepting encomiums, said, “I don’t think anybody is a born good lawyer. It takes hard work, a lots of hard work, to be a good lawyer.” Adding that whatever he is today is due to his father and mentor  , who was a barrister in law, he said the event was a home-coming for him, as he had practised for over 25 years in the high court before shifting base to Delhi.
 
 Earlier, while delivering the inaugural address, MBA president and senior lawyer   said it was a matter of great pride that Venugopal was a former member of the association which was one of the oldest in the country.
