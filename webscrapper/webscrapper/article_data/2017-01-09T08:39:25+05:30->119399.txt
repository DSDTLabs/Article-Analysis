JODHPUR: Expressing displeasure at the   of an 11-year-old order, high court (HC) has summoned the state’s advocate general with the compliance report pertaining to the guidelines for issuance of   on January 11.

 While hearing a petition in 2004, wherein the petitioner had raised suspicion on the veracity of a medical certificate issued by the government hospital of Nagaur, HC then had, however, rejected the petition. But it had issued an interim order on March 2005 to get the medical certificate examined and to fix the responsibility in such matters ensuring appropriate punishment to the guilty.
 
 The court had then commented “the doctors of government hospitals usually issue false certificates on unreal grounds, which leads to litigation. Taking undue advantage of these false certificates, the government employees and officials not only claim holidays but also deal a blow to the exchequer”.
 
 Observing this, the high court had directed the principal secretary (Medical & Health), then, to draw guidelines for issuance of medical certificates with respect to fixing the accountability on issuance of false certificate and prosecuting those issuing false certificate and produce the compliance report in the court.
 
 Though, the report on the certificate by the Nagaur hospital had been placed in the court then but in absence of the guideline, the matter had been held in abeyance then.
 
 The petitioner, on rejection of the petition, had moved to the division bench, which also rejected the petition on November 17 last year. After this, the matter again referred to the single bench of the high court, where Justice Sanjeev Prakash Sharma has again issued direction to the principal secretary to draw the guidelines and has summoned the advocate general on January 11 with the compliance report.
