Bhopal: Three government clerks have been suspended for allegedly sharing objectionable content on social media platforms during the violent Dalit protests in   earlier this week. A treasury official may also be penalized, say sources. 

 All three - Suresh Kaushal, Yogesh Gupta and   - are posted at the Bhind collectorate. The administration issued their suspension order on Thursday and sent notices to 17 employees, who were absent on April 2, when violence erupted and led to the deaths of four people. A recommendation has been made to the Chambal divisional commissioner to suspend an assistant treasury officer, say sources. "These people were absent from duty and were found sharing objectionable content on social media during the protests, which is not expected from a public servant," district collector   told TOI. 
 
 Biometric attendance system was installed in Bhind collectorate a few months ago. The administration is also checking records of employees, who came to the office that day but left before check-out time. "We've set up an IT cell to keep an eye on social media and action will be taken if people share objectionable contents," he said.
