AHMEDABAD: Severely ill cancer patients were left witless as resident doctors, nurses,   and   at   went on strike en masse on Thursday. They were protesting the alleged assault on a resident doctor that took place on Thursday, early morning. 

 Twenty surgeries in the oncology department were postponed, while patients went without  . Patients from all corners of the state come to GCRI, as it is a public hospital.
 
 "Since surgeries of these patients were scheduled, they had not been given food as part of   It was quite late when we came to know the surgeries had been cancelled, and they could be served food," said a nurse of pre-operation ward in GCRI on condition of anonymity. "We learned late that all doctors and nurses have to join the strike," added the nurse.
 
 Around 150 resident doctors, 410 nursing staff, 250 service staff members and a few lab technicians went on strike on Thursday after a resident doctor at GCRI was allegedly assaulted at 12.30 am.
 
 Many patients scheduled for discharge were stranded at the hospital. Vinod Jogani, 30, a resident of Kutch, said, "My sister-in-law, 17, has blood cancer and has been here for a month for chemotherapy." 
 
 "Doctors said she will be discharged on Thursday after reports are received. But she remains stuck here without either reports or discharge, as both doctors and staff are on strike," Jogani added.
 
 Vijay Tulsani, 51, who'd come from Bhavnagar, ran around the whole day for a medicine prescription for his wife - a breast cancer patient. "I came from Bhavnagar with my sick wife. It took about five hours by bus. Not a single doctor, since early morning, has agreed to spend five minutes to see her medical file and write a prescription," said Tulsani.
 
 "I can't buy cancer medicines from a store without a doctor's prescription," Tulsani said.
