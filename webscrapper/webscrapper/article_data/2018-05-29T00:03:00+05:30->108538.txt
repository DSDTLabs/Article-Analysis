All of 17-years-old, Greenwood High student Anusha Singh is doing her bit for the visually impaired children through her ‘Build A Vision’ initiative, which allows her to create   products, which she then uses to generate funds and donate to a local NGO. How did the idea of producing tactile products come about? “It was only last spring that I was working with an organisation, where I was recording audio books for visually impaired children. But that didn’t work out because my accent wasn’t too Indianised. Since I was unable to help with the audio books, I wanted to help in some other way. That’s when I came across GiftAbled, an   that works with visually impaired children. The founder of the NGO introduced me to tactile and that’s where the whole idea of creating my own tactile products came up,” she says.

 Since then, Anusha, who had earlier learnt Braille in Class 9, did a lot of research and began working on her very own tactile library. “I visited a library for the visually impaired in the US last summer to learn how to work on tactile products. Once I got the hang of it, I started working on my very own tactile books and soon I had 40 of them,” she says, adding, “Since I wanted to continue this initiative, I decided to create a   to spread awareness about the work and also used these tactile products as a means to garner donation.”
 
 Anusha soon began dividing her books into categories — concepts, objects, and experiences. Concepts involve numbers, alphabets and patterns. Objects involve insects, vehicles, utensils, and all that we encounter or use on a daily basis. Experiences involve different aspects of an event, nature or a time of year. She now wants to continue her initiative in a bigger manner. “I am already teaching students at my school how to create tactile products. I have a team consisting of teenagers and a few adults who work on this initiative. I want to continue my work and spread it across the schools in Karnataka,” she sums up.
