LUCKNOW/DELHI: On a day his son and UP CM   and Congress vice-president   showcased the SP-Congress alliance with a roadshow in Lucknow, SP patri arch   struck a discordant note, rejecting the tie-up and refusing to campaign for the new political alignment.

 Talking to a news agency in Delhi, Mulayam said SP was capable of winning the elections and forming a government on its own and there was no need for an alliance. “We contested the elections alone and we got majority and formed the government,“ Mulayam said referring to the 2012 assembly polls. He said the alliance was not required. “I have always opposed the Congress which have ruled for so long but have done nothing for the development of the nation,“ Mulayam said, adding, “I am totally against the alliance between the   and the Congress and will not campaign for this tie-up in the elections.“
 
 Expressing disappointment over the SP giving away105 seats to the Congress as a part of the seat-sharing formula, Mulayam said this will hit the party wor kers who have been working in the hope of contesting elections.“SP leaders who lost their seats as part of the alliance deal, what will they do for the next five years?“ Mu layam said.
 
 He said the party workers should spread the word around that the alliance won't benefit the party . Mulayam's rejection of the SP-Congress alliance might create confusion among his die-hard supporters in the minority community over their support to ths combine. SP spokeperson   refused to comment saying she was confident Akhilesh would take up the issue with the party founder and convince him that the alliance was important to completely demolish the communal forces.
