Ponda: Taking a dig at the BJP, former chief minister and Poriem Congress MLA Pratapsingh Rane said the ruling alliance was raising its voice over the mining issue only to gain political mileage in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Organised by the Goa Mining People’s Front at Gomantak Vidyalaya Grounds, Piliem, Dharbandora, the largely-attended meeting which had representatives of all political parties on the dais, made a strong call for promulgation of ordinance to resolve the mining crisis at the earliest. Mining stakeholders warned of protests if mining operations are not resumed at the earliest. Many of the speakers also demanded a mining ordinance  Expressing surprise over the BJP’s delay to resolve the issue, leader of opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar said, “This clearly illustrates the lack of concurrence between the BJP’s state and Union governments. The government has no will to restart mining.”  Meanwhile, BJP Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral said the party has met PMO chief secretary Nrupendra Mishra and briefed him about the issue. Stating that mining operations would definitely resume, MGP Sanvordem MLA Deepak Pauskar said that they would not allow some mining companies to begin operations unless they reinstated the staff who had been retrenched earlier.
