JAIPUR: The city’s infrastructure projects which are moving at snail’s pace due to   are expected to gain momentum as the   ( NCRPB) on Friday has given in-principle approval to sanction loan for the eight major projects, including revival of   river and elevated road. 

 The board has approved Rs 1,098 crore for revival of Dravyavati river and Rs 565 crore seven ongoing   (ROBs), including the ambitious elevated road project. The   is expecting to receive the funds in February. 
 
 With the JDA coffers running dry, the future of city’s infrastructure projects had hit a roadblock. According to sources, the JDA has nearly Rs 100 crore in its account. However, this is not sufficient to fund the projects. “The NCRPB has provided 75% as loan as the project cost. Now, the loan is received, the pace of these projects will not be affected,” said a source
 
 For the 2016-2017 financial year, the JDA expects to earn Rs 900 crore from auctioning land. But considering the current market condition, this target looks nearly impossible to achieve. “The fixed expenses such as remuneration of employees and payment of contractors are high. We have to also invite tenders for many civil works such as road repair, drainage, gardens, etc. These works have to be taken up on a priority basis,” said a JDA official to TOI.
