PATNA: The classical works of 7th Century AD erudite Vedanta scholar from Mithila,  , will be, for the first time, discussed and reviewed by the modern scholars at a national workshop being organized by   (JNU) in New Delhi from March 18 to 24.

 Even though this scholar is well known throughout the length and breadth of the country, very few people are aware of his various works. Most of his writings in Sanskrit could not reach the masses until they were published in the 20th Century.
 
 Surprisingly, most people know him, either in relation to Shankaracharya or as the past of Sureshwaracharya. His six famous books are – Brahmsiddhi (1984), Bhaavanaviveka (1922), Mimansanukrmnika (1930), Vibhramviveka (1932), Vidhiviveka (1907) and Sfotsiddhi (1931).
 
 The editor of his most legendary and pioneering work Brahmsiddhi, Kuppuswami has precisely marked the period of Mandan Mishra from 615-695 AD, and the period of Shankaracharya from 632-664 AD. Obviously, both were contemporaries with a little gap of the age.
 
 Workshop convenor Deo Shankar Navin, who is a teacher of JNU’s Centre for Indian Languages, said the workshop on ‘Advaita Vedantee Mandan Mishra and his masterpiece work Brahmsiddhi’ is being sponsored by the Indian Council of Philosophical Research, New Delhi. Eminent scholars and philosophers, including National Sanskrit Institute former vice-chancellor Radha Ballabh Tripathi, Indian   chairman R S Bhatt and JNU vice-chancellor M Jagdish Kumar will take part in the deliberations.
