In the upcoming track of ' ', which airs Monday to Friday at 7.30 pm on Sony SAB, superhero Yo-Man ( ) will be up against mother nature. This is because the baddie Mr X ( ) is controlling the city by manipulating the climate with the ‘snow storm’ machine he has invented. With it, he can make Mumbai colder in a minute and conjure up snowfall. With freezing temperature, 
people begin to fall seriously ill. 
 By holding the city to ransom, Mr X hopes to have his demands met by the government. Now, Yo-Man is in a dilemma as he not only wants his parents, Mrs and Mr Agarwal (  and  ) to have a memorable celebration on their 25th wedding anniversary, but also wants to find out the reason behind the drastic weather change.
  Says Ajay, “I wish there was snowfall for real in Mumbai, but not the way Mr X is planning. I loved the feeling where I could control the weather, at least on screen. The visuals of this track are a treat to watch and will appeal to the audiences, too.”
