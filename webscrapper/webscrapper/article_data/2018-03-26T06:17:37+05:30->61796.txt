PANAJI: The government has the right to carry out public utility services in land belonging to it and persons occupying it cannot raise objections, ad-hoc district judge   ruled in a recent judgment.

 The matter pertains to a civil suit filed in December 2009 by a Panaji resident, praying for mandatory injunction against the laying of a sewage line and building of chambers through his property at   by the public works department (PWD).
 
 Further, he prayed for shifting of the sewage line and claimed that he is entitled to compensation of Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3.3 lakh additionally from the PWD for alleged damages caused to his property and an old house.
 
 The plaintiff alleged that without permission from the Corporation of the City of Panaji ( ), the PWD had illegally laid the sewage line along his property to provide connection to his neighbour. The line had been laid along a retaining wall. 
 
 Advocate for the government and PWD,  , argued that the government owns the land, though the plaintiff’s ancestors partly possessed it, and the government has the right to utilise it for public purpose and the plaintiff is not entitled for any compensation.   also argued that the PWD had done the work under the Public Health Act, 2005, with all approvals from CCP.
 
 The defendant’s witness, then assistant engineer C  , stated that two other occupants had given their no objection cerfificates ( ) for it, and the municipality had built the retaining wall.
 
 The   upheld arguments about the project’s public utility, noting that co-owners had given their approval and even the plaintiff has benefitted from it. 
 
 While dismissing the suit, the judge ruled that there is no evidence as proof of damage to his house
