Panaji: If the mood in the Congress camp is any indication, it appears that the grand old party is not confident about the crucial floor test in the state legislative assembly and is preparing to sit in the opposition.

 While Congress emissaries continued to hold back channel talks with independent MLAs and supporters of the Goa Forward Party (GFP), the party’s core leadership seemed resigned to the fact that it may lose the floor test.
 
 Political observers say that if the party’s talks with the GFP and some independents fall through, it could stage a walk out to save face.
 
 “We were elected as the single largest party and we are confident,” AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh said while speaking to TOI over the phone. He refused to explain how the Congress aimed to break the BJP camp, but said party functionaries were working on a plan.
 
 Most Congress MLAs refused to comment on the party’s strategy, offering an irritated, “ask the senior leaders” reply.
 
 Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar, said that with eight non-BJP MLAs supporting the Manohar Parrikar state government, the regime would not last more than six months.
 
 His statements, along with some made by AICC secretary Girish Chondankar, indicate that the Congress may be resigned to the fact that it will spend another term in the assembly’s opposition benches.
