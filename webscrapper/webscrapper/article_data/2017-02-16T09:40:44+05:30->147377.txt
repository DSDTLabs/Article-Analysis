SILIGURI: If Wednesday evening's come-from-behind 1-1 draw against Lajong FC - three days after the 0-0 stalemate with   at the Kanchenjungha Stadium here - is anything to go by, Trevor Morgan's side looks to have suffered a dip in form. 

 The East Bengal coach did admit was that Wednesday's performance was the “most frustrating one” in the nine rounds of I-League. Samuel Lalmuanpuia gave the neighbouring visitors a shock lead in the 20th minute but Trinidadian Willis Plaza equalised in the 45th to restore parity.
 
 East Bengal thus finished the first phase as table-toppers with 21 points, but archrivals   are breathing down their neck. Lajong FC took their tally to 13 points from 9 games.
 
 
 
 
 MUMBAI: The goalless draw between   and Mohun Bagan at Cooperage was not boring at all. There were chances for both teams and the host even had a first-half Thoi Singh goal struck off for offside, but nil-nil was how it finished as Santosh Kashyap's men would have at least been left relieved at ending their six-match losing streak.
 
 
 
 
 AIZAWL: Aizawl FC maintained their unbeaten home record when they held off defending champions one-all here on Wednesday. Brandon Vanlalremdika drew first blood for the hosts in the 40th minute, while   cancelled the lead five minutes later. Chhetri's goal ­ his 90th in the I-League -helped him leapfrog Bhaichung Bhutia to as the highest-ever scorer combining both NFL & I-League. Minerva also played a 0-0 draw against DSK Shivajians.
