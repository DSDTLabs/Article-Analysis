AHMEDABAD: The city continued to bake as the mercury climbed to 43 degrees on Thursday, 1.3 degrees above normal. State capital   was the hottest place in the state at 44 degrees. Deesa recorded 43.4°C while   recorded 42.6 degrees. 

  continued to fall prey to dehydration and heat stroke caused by the fire spitting sun with 108 EMRI handling 459 heat-related emergencies on Thursday in the state. Ahmedabad reported 118 heat-related emergencies. This is in addition to over 17,000 heat-related emergencies handled by 108 this month. 
 
 Weatherman said that while heat would continue to prevail at current temperatures on Friday, some respite is expected during the weekend.
 
 “This is because strong westerly winds are blowing over   at the surface. Since westerly winds are laden with moisture, they are expected to bring down the temperature by 2-3 degrees across the state", said senior meteorologist Manorama Mohanty.
 
 Mohanty said that even though people are feeling extreme heat, currently the temperatures are quite close to normal temperatures recorded during this time of the month.
 
 Meanwhile, people complained of extreme fatigue and disorientation even during short exposures to heat. "Despite tanking up on fluids like buttermilk, lemon water etc, a trip to Gandhinagar on the bike left me reeling under severe heat symptoms including fatigue and headache. The heat is unbearable", said Parthiv Bhatt, a software consultant who works in Gandhinagar and stays in Ahmedabad.
 
 Doctors advised to cover one's head with a wet cloth before wearing a helmet and cooling the car before entering into the vehicle to avoid the body falling prey to exposure to extreme variations in temperatures.
