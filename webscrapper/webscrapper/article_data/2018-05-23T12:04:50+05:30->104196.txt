COIMBATORE: The car driver of health minister C Vijayabaskar’s father-in-law was arrested on Tuesday on charges of rape and murder of a woman, who was working as a maid at the latter’s house at   here.

 The arrested was identified as K Manivel, 34 of Ramanthapuram. He is married with two children.
 
 According to police, S Jayanthi, 35, of   at Ramanathapuram, had been working as a maid at the health minister’s father-in-law Chidambaram’s house for the past couple of months. “Chidambaram had gone to his elder daughter’s house in the US a month ago, entrusting the house to his driver Manivel,” an investigation officer said.
 
 Meanwhile, Manivel’s wife, along with the two children, left for her parents’ house in Trichy. Hence, Manivel decided to stay put at Chidambaram’s house.
 
 When Jayanthi didn’t return home after work at Chidambaram’s house on May 17, her husband   lodged a complaint with the Ramanathapuram police, who registered a woman missing case. Two days later, her decomposed body was found in a drainage canal at Singanallur.
 
 The police, subsequently, detained Manivel for interrogation. Manivel told the police that he had strangulated Jayanthi as she tried to escape from the house when he attempted to rape her. “When she fell unconscious, he raped her. He then packed the body in a gunny bag, took it to Singanallur in a car and dumped it in the drainage canal,” the officer said.
 
 As postmortem report confirmed the rape on Tuesday evening, the police registered a case against Manivel, arrested and remanded him in judicial custody.
