NAVI MUMBAI:A 61-year-old man foiled a   attempt by two bike-borne robbers who had targeted him outside a bank in Panvel. 

 The pillion bike rider tried to snatch a polythene bag with Rs 1.5 lakh from Anil Deshmukh’s hand but he didn’t lose his grip over the bag and started shouting for help. However, the thieves sped away.
 
 The incident occurred on Monday around 1.30pm when Deshmukh had gone to the bank for depositing the cash, belonging to a construction firm where he was working as a manager. 
 
 “I had parked my bike near Bank of India and was walking towards the bank with Rs 1.5 lakh in a polythene bag. Two men on a bike crossed my way and stopped at a distance of 50 metres. The pillion rider then got off the bike and tried to snatch my bag from behind. But, I held on to the bag tightly and due to the sudden jerk the bag fell to the ground. I picked it up before he could lay his hands on it. As I shouted for help, the two robbers panicked and sped away,” Deshmukh said.
 
 Senior inspector   said the   sped away but after some distance they skid and fell. As some passersby were chasing the robbers, the duo abandoned the bike and ran away in the bylanes.
