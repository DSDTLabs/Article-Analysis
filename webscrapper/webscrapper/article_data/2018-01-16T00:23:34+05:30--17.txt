New Delhi: The capital’s maximum   continued to remain several notches above normal on Monday as relatively warm conditions prevailed throughout the day. The maximum temperature was recorded at 23.6 degrees Celsius – four degrees above normal. Met officials have forecast the maximum to rise even   in the next few days, touching close to 26 degrees with winds from the south likely to start blowing soon.

 “There is a westerly component in the wind which has raised the day-time temperature above normal, along with clear skies,” said a scientist at the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre in Delhi.
 
 The minimum temperature on Monday was, however, recorded at 6.4 degrees Celsius – one degree below normal. The rise in temperature has not affected the air quality much which continued to remain in the “very poor” category with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 330 as compared to a reading of 318 on Sunday. AQI levels between 300 to 400 are classified as “very poor” according to CPCB.
 
 Data according to CPCB’s central control room showed Delhi’s average PM2.5 levels to be around 181 micrograms per cubic metre at 8pm, while the average PM10 levels were recorded at 335 micrograms per cubic metre at the same time — both three times the safe standard. SAFAR forecasts show a rise in both PM2.5 and PM10 levels on Tuesday.
