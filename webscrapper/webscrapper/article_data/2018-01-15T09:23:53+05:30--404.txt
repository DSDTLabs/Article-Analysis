PUNE: The MIDC’s attempt to establish ownership on the record of rights document is facing a hurdle with some papers of land it bought are either   or are not available with the revenue department. 

 The drive to update the records by the   (MIDC) started a year ago following the alleged   land scam involving former revenue minister  . After the controversy of its ownership came up,   embarked on the exercise to review its land records and ensure accurate reflection of acquisition proceedings.
 
 At present, the revenue authorities are facing trouble in tracing records of land bought by MIDC some 40-50 years ago. These land were mainly bought from the   and Bhosari MIDC regions. Though MIDC officials have said 78% work of updating land records has been completed, the remaining 21% is turning out to be a challenge to meet before March 31.
 
 With MIDC acquiring 78,000 hectare of land in the state, update work has been completed for 61,000 hectares of plots from various MIDC region offices, MIDC joint CEO A B   said. ‘The MIDC officials are cooperating with the revenue authorities to update the record of rights. The main hurdle is some missing land document,” he told TOI.
 
 In cases of documents not being traced, Misal said a high-level committee appointed by the state government will have to take a call on the instances.
 
 “We have now set a new deadline of March 31 this year,” a senior revenue official said.
 
 MIDC has a land bank of approximately 78,000 hectare, with about 73,000 hectare more in the process of acquisition at various stages. Instructions have been issued that all future acquisition proceedings will be updated.
