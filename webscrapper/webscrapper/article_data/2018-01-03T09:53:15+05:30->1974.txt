NEW DELHI: "My Name is Khan and I am not a terrorist," Pakistan's   chairman   tweeted on Tuesday. The tweet came following his bail in all the four cases regarding an attack on   Television (PTV) headquarters in 2014.

  
  
  Driving inspiration from the actor   starrer Bollywood movie 'My name is Khan,' the Khan in question resorted to a Twitter post that reeked of a theatrical narrative as it read the movie's famous dialogue, "My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist."
 
  On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad accepted the pre-arrest bail appeal of PTI chief, reported the Dawn.
 
  Earlier, the cricketer-turned-politician, told the media outside the court after the ruling, "The decision proves that I am sadiq (truthful) and ameen (righteous), not a terrorist, I am a ladla [darling] of the law because I abide by it."
 
  The PTI chief took the occasion to take a pot-shot at former Prime Minister   and added, "Nawaz Sharif could not have withstood half of the scrutiny that I went through. I've never stolen anything in my life."
 
  According to the media reports, in August 2014, supporters of the PTI and its ally Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) allegedly attacked properties in Islamabad's Red Zone including those of state institutions. They were also charged with attacking the then Islamabad SSP Operations Asmatullah Junejo.
