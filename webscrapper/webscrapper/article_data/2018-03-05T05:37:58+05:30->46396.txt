NEW DELHI: A 20-year-old youth who went to save a woman from being attacked by her   himself got   in west Delhi’s Inderpuri on Saturday. 

 The victim, Lalit, said that after hearing a woman crying for help, he immediately drove in her direction. But the husband, irritated by Lalit’s intervention, pulled him out of the car and stabbed him in the neck and the palms. The police rushed to the spot after being informed by a local and   was taken to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where he was treated and discharged later in the night. 
 
 Lalit said he was going to park his car in the neighbourhood when he noticed the man shouting at his wife with a knife in his hand. “It was just two streets away. Despite the street being narrow, I started driving towards the couple who was fighting in the middle of the road while everyone else in the neighbourhood stood watching.” Scared that the man might attack his wife, Lalit made up his mind to intervene to save her.
 
 The accused stared at Lalit for some time and then started hurling abuses at his wife again. “As I moved ahead, the man got irritated and asked me to get off the car.” 
 
 Lalit said that after he was sure that the man won’t harm the woman, he started moving forward. “The man, whom I later identified as  , came to my car and as my windows were rolled down, he pulled me out by my collar,” said the victim. 
 
 “Before I could say or do anything, he started attacking me with the same knife with which he was threatening his wife. As I feared that he might stab me in the stomach, I grabbed the knife with both hands, injuring my palms further,” Lalit said. He said that seeing him bleed profusely, the man left his wife and ran away. Ikhtiyar is still absconding. 
 
 A case under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code has been registered at Inderpuri police station, said a senior police officer.
