AURANGABAD: Several consumers have demanded that the time limit for   of power connection be increased by at least couple of days. The facility, which is part of recently introduced mobile application by the MSEDCL, enables consumers to submit meter reading on their own to avoid receiving average billing.

 As per current system, system generated SMS is sent to registered mobile number of consumers to make self-submission of meter reading within 48-hours. Consumers complained that even if officially two-days are marked for making necessary submission, they get effectively lesser time in hand for completing the formalities.
 
 “I received system generated message almost during second half of the day when I was outstation, asking me to submit message by next day. The facility of self-submission is very good move, but same has to be made more consumer-friendly by increasing the time limit upto say minimum four –days,” said Nalini Beedkar, a consumer.
 
 When contacted,  , central public relation officer for MSEDCL, said the consumers’ feedback would be submitted to top-brass of the power utility. “The mobile application is meant for improving customer satisfaction level and the feedback would be submitted to policy makers to improve the service offered through our mobile application,” he said.
 
 The recently introduced mobile application by the state power utility that offers wide range of benefits has been downloaded by more than five lakh users within few months of its formal launch.
