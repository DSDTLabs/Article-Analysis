CHANDIGARH: Punjab government on Saturday transferred as many as 42 senior and middle rank officers in districts and police headquarters, with the list bearing a clear stamp of Punjab police chief Suresh Arora.

 Incumbent ADGP (bureau of investigation)  , a   officer, has been replaced by Arora with Sahota's batchmate Prabodh Kumar.
 
 Like 1988-batch officer IPS Dinkar Gupta, who is perceived to be Arora's most bankable officer, was made intelligence wing chief. Kumar too was handpicked by Arora to head the BOI wing.
 
 Interestingly, Kumar was made the head of most special investigation teams (SIT), including Pathankot terror attack, Nabha Jail break and attacks and assassinations of Hindu leaders, none of which have seen any big headway so far.
 
 Even as   headed by Kumar failed to deliver results, Sahota never enjoyed Arora's confidence
 
 The transfer also saw more reshuffle in intelligence wing with the exit of incumbent IG (intelligence) Rajesh Jaiswwal and IG (counter-intelilgence) M Farooqui. Both Kumar and Farooqui go to BOI wing under Prabodh Kumar.
 
 Another member of Arora's team, 1993-batch IPS officer Praveen Sinha, has been rewarded with a plum posting as Jalandhar police commissioner.
 
 Sinha has been working closely with Arora and Gupta. He replaces incumbent commissioner Arpit Shukla, who goes as Jalandhar Zone IG.
 
 Incumbent IG (security) Mukhwinder Chhina, who has enjoyed good relations with the Congress government in the past, has been rewarded with a plum post as IG (Bathinda Zone)
 
 Gupta's batch-mate ADGP (IT&T) V K Bhawra has been given additional charge of modernisation and provisioning.
 
 The government has also reshuffled SSPS of Bathinda, Khanna, Nawanshahr.
