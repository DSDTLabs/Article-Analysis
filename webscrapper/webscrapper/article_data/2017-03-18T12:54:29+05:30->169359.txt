'Beauty and the Beast' director   would love to work with   on 'The  ' if he was invited to take charge of Disney's latest revamp. 

 The actress is actively seeking the role of Ariel in the live-action remake, and in an online plea to studio bosses last month, the '  Girls' star suggested Condon should direct her. 
 
  
  
 "It was very sweet of her (to mention me). I hope she gets to make that movie. I feel like I was so lucky in getting this crown jewel (Beauty and the Beast), but I'll see her in Little Mermaid, absolutely," Condon says. 
 
 Disney bosses have yet to respond to Lohan's plea, but they confirmed they are working on a new version of  's mermaid tale last year. 
 
 Lin-Manuel Miranda will work with Oscar-winning songwriter Alan Menken on the music for the revamp.
