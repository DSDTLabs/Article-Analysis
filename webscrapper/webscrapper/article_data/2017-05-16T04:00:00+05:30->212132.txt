Ahmedabad: Even as Kutch police has submitted a report on a Border Security Force (BSF) jawan being honeytrapped by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan, the BSF has found nothing incriminating against him. The jawan, hailing from Kanuaj in Uttar Pradesh, was posted on a floating border outpost at Sir Creek in Kutch. “It was alleged in the police report that the jawan was honeytrapped by ISI through a social media platform,” a BSF official said. “The jawan engaged with two social media profiles, purportedly of women, through his cellphone numbers. The police report mentioned that the jawan was using multiple SIM cards.”

 
 The BSF had ordered an internal inquiry on the basis of the police report. “We have found nothing against the jawan so far,” the official said. “He stopped interacting with the women when he realized they were going off track. The interactions were not of a serious nature and did not lead to a security hazard.”
 
 BSF officials said there was nothing alarming about the number of SIM cards mentioned in the report. “It has come to light that he had got the cards offered by service providers during promotional campaigns,” the official said. “We have also verified that the extra money deposited in his bank account was from the sale of land at his native place.”
 
 The BSF confirmed that the jawan had been transferred to Jaisalmer which falls under the jurisdiction of the BSF Gujarat Frontier just to ensure a thorough probe. A top BSF official said that the force maintains hawk-eyed vigilance on the area in which the jawan had been deployed earlier, since Sir Creek falls under a sensitive zone where Pakistani fishing boats are often abandoned.
 
 Recently, the BSF had apprehended two Pakistani boats with 10 crew members. “During the past six months, the BSF has seized more than eight Pakistani fishing boats from the area,” the official said.
