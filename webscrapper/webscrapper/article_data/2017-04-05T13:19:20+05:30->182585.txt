THANE: The   police have arrested a commission agent at the   market, who was wanted by the APMC police from September last year for allegedly cheating a trader of around Rs 2.5 crore. 

 Nikhil Agrawal, the arrested accused, hails from Indore and has cases of cheating and criminal breach of trust registered against him at Taloja, Ambernath and Indore in  .
 
 Advocate  , representing compliant trader Salim Gazi, a Nerul resident, in the criminal case registered at APMC police station alleged, "The modus operandi of Agrawal is to carry out trading between two traders without introducing them to each other. After confirming the deal with the supplier, he would use his own transport vehicle to move the agricultural produce from the supplier and thereafter sell the commodity to a third party and accept a payment from the third party without the knowledge of the supplier. He would tell the supplier trader that the initial consignee had only given a part payment and would make a part payment to the supplier through an online transaction." 
 
 He added that the cheating came to light in May 2016 after the complainant inquired with the buyer as an outstanding payment of Rs 38 lakh of the complainant, who had sold lentils, was delayed by Agarwal's firm and was told by the buyer that they have not received any consignment.
 
 "We have now sought Agarwal's transit remand in an application to the Thane court," said senior inspector of APMC police, Rajendra Galande.
