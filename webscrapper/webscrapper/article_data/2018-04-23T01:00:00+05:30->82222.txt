PATNA: The body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a maize field at Musahari village under the Musahari police station area in   district on Sunday morning. Police suspect the girl was raped and murdered.

 When contacted over phone, women’s police station SHO Jyoti Kumari said the villagers spotted the body at around 6am and informed the police. “Prima facie it seems that the girl was raped and murdered. Blood clots were spotted on the body. There is strangulation mark on her neck and it seems the killer used a rope to strangulate her,” the SHO said.
 
 The SHO, quoting the statement of the victim’s mother, said she had returned home after watching TV at a neighbour’s house at around 10pm on Saturday night. “Almost after ten minutes, she went outside to relieve herself after informing her mother. However, she did not return and her mother fell asleep without checking why her daughter did not come back,” the SHO said and added that a small box filled with tobacco was seized from the spot.
 
 “The spot from where the body was recovered is almost half a kilometre away from the victim’s residence,” she said. “A team of experts from forensic science laboratory (FSL) in the district was requisitioned to gather exhibits from the spot. In addition, a dog squad was also roped in for identifying the suspects, but it yielded no results as a large number of villagers had gathered there even before the squad was called,” she said.
 
 The SHO said the body was sent to S K Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) for postmortem. “Police have written the hospital for conducting the post mortem by a medical board. The clothes of the deceased have been seized by forensic experts.
