GURUGRAM: Electricity supply to the   in Palam Vihar’s Block J was restored on Thursday after senior deputy mayor Pramila   took note of the TOI report. 

 The school had been reeling under the absence of power supply since March 27. The electricity department had cut off the supply as the school failed to clear dues amounting to Rs 61,000. 
 
 “The TOI report on schoolchildren suffering due to unavailability of power supply on the premises shocked me. This matter was under my consideration for some time as the teachers had requested me to intervene,” senior deputy mayor Kablana said. She asked her staff to go to the electricity office and get the problem resolved on priority basis. 
 
 Meanwhile,  , block elementary education officer said, “The school’s electricity bill amounting to Rs 61,000 is pending. Power supply has been resolved for the time being following the intervention of a local leader.” 
 
 When asked by when would the dues be cleared, Gaur said, “It will take another one week as we have sent the file to Chandigarh for approval. The education department had no knowledge about the pending bills. The school principal never raised the issue with us. We got to know about the same recently when teachers complained and newspapers carried out reports.” 
 
 The school teachers and principal confirmed that the electricity supply had been restored though the water supply issue is still pending. The school principal, however, said that they were hopeful that with Kablana’s support the issue would be resolved soon. “I am working on the water supply connection. I am hopeful that the issue will be solved by Friday,” Kablana added.
