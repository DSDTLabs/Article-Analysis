GURUGRAM: A 26-year-old software engineer allegedly committed suicide in his rented accommodation in Sector 23. No suicide note has been found. 

 Police said Jagroshan, originally from Prithala in Fatehabad district, was living as a tenant on the third floor of a house in Sector 23. He was working as a software engineer, but had resigned a few days ago and founded his own startup. 
 
 Jagroshan allegedly locked himself up in his room on Thursday. 
 
 On Saturday morning, tenants on the third floor told the landlord of a foul odour emanating from his room. When the landlord came upstairs to investigate, the door was found to be locked. 
 
 The landlord, with the help of tenants, broke open the door to find Jagroshan hanging from the ceiling. He then called cops.
 
 A police team soon reached the house and took the body into custody. No suicide note was found in his room. Jagroshan’s family was informed and the body was handed over to them after a postmortem for the last rites. 
 
 The cause behind the suicide hasn’t been ascertained yet. Cops said he committed suicide around two days ago.
 
 “Jagroshan’s family told us that he had been mentally unstable for some time now, but the actual reason for the suicide is not clear yet as no suicide note was found. We are investigating the case,” said inspector Vikram Nehra, SHO of Palam Vihar police station.
