NEW DELHI: In a bid to infuse transparency,   will now digitise the   by vendors for payment and issue of inspection certificates by agencies, aiming for complete   of its contract management system.

 As reported by TOI, the transporter has already introduced the   (LC) mode of payment as an option in supply/works contracts to improve transparency and 'ease of doing' business.
 
 An official said, "All tenders for supply/works having an estimated value of Rs 10 lakh and above shall include in tender conditions an option for the contractors to take payment from railways through LC arrangements." It would cost 0.15 per cent of the LC to the contractors.
 
 The railways has already undertaken steps for digitisation of its entire supply chain in a bid to adopt end-to-end paperless working in contract management by eliminating human intervention.
 
 "With the new system in place, vendors or contractors will not have to come to office for submission of bills and getting inspection certificates," said an official. "The bill approval status can be tracked online," he said. 
 
 The system includes digitisation of processes like bill submission, inspection, dispatches, receipt, bill passing and bill payments, and warrantee monitoring.
 
 With 100 per cent e-tenders and e-auctions already assimilated into the system, railways is further planning to build on these initiatives to achieve seamless flow of materials, finances and information.
 
 Currently, the railways has about 52,000 suppliers registered with a huge transaction order of rolling stock, track items, maintenance spares and other such items.
