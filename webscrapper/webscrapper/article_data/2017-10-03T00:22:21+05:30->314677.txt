Jaipur: In a major respite to information seekers, the information commissioner (IC) of Rajasthan has directed the chief secretary to appoint public information officers (PIO) and first appellate authority (FAA) officials in ministers’ offices on Monday.

 The order also stated that the appointments of PIOs and FAAs to be made within a month. “Every state department should display the name of the PIO and FAA on their websites. They should also voluntary disclose information mandated under the   Act," said Ashutosh Sharma, IC.
 
 The absence of RTI officers is a violation of the guidelines on appointing PIOs for RTI in minsiters’offices.
 
 The order is likely to strengthen the dissemination of information under RTI as most of the departments don’t have PIOs and FAAs. The lack of PIOs has either delayed information for months or resulted in the department rejecting the application seeking information. The present situation is a grave inconvenience for information seekers.
 
 The order remarked that the CMO office has a PIO under the RTI Act article 5 (1). “However, the offices of ministers do not have the system which is required for the smooth flow of information. The absence of officers is enabling the department to expresses inability to process information which is against the spirit of RTI,” read the IC’s order.
 
 Information relating to files, note sheets, entry and exit of visitors comes under the purview of ministers’ offices. “Thus it becomes important for departments to appoint PIOs,” the order said.
 
 The order has been issued following an appeal filed by one Gaurishannkar Malu, who sought information under the RTI Act from the rural development and panchayati raj department. He was denied information due to the absence of PIOs and FAAs.
