Rapper   says he and ex-wife   are able to co-parent their kids properly as the keep their egos aside.

  
  
 The 36-year-old musician, who has five-year-old twins Moroccan and   with Carey, said their kids are their priority.
 
 "You put the kids first. But then when you understand that you have unconditional love for these human beings and you want the best existence for them, then you put whatever differences you may have had aside. "A lot of times, when you think about breakups in relationships, it's usually over ego. And if you can remove your ego from that, and make it about your loved ones, that's what it's all about,"   said. 
 
 The former 'America's Got Talent' judge had earlier said that he won't let his celebrity status influence his children's career paths.
