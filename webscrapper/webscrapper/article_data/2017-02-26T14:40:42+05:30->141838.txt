 has been seeing several romantic films. While many portrayed how the parents are against love marriage,   takes a different route. In this film, the director reasons out why parents disagree with their children entering a love marriage. 'It is a realistic and emotional love story. Many films have been showing only lovers' point of view, but this one will explain why parents are averse to love marriages. We will begin shooting from March mid-week,' says director   Mahesh. 

 The film will have newcomers in the lead. '  will play the lead. He's a college student who doesn't have any film background. We were looking for someone who has boy-next-door looks. We auditioned several people, and he performed well,' says Yogandhra, adding, 'I am looking for a female lead. I will finalise the rest in a couple of weeks. We will be shooting primarily in Nagercoil, Kanyakumari. Some portions will be shot in Bengaluru.' 
 
 Though this is Mahesh's debut, he is confident. 'I earlier worked as an assistant to director  . I later co-directed a couple of films with Shiva Shanmugam. Eventually, I wanted to make my own film. That's how the work on this film began,' he signs off.
