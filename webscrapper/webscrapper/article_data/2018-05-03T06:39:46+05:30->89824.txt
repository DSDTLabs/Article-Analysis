 Lopez has twins Emme and Max with her former husband   while Rodriguez has daughters Natasha and Ella.
 
 "For me, he is so lovely and he is so supportive and encouraging of everything that I do," Lopez said. "I'm glad that he sees me that way, that I would be a good role model to his girls. You know, I'm just trying to be a good mom to mine and the best I can be for all four of them," she added. 
 
 What's her plan for Mother's Day?
 
 "You know it depends every year. The kids just always plan a little something. It's always very sweet and I try to always see my mom and take her out for a minute. Nothing too crazy."
