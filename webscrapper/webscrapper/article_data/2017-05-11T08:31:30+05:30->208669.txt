THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: “Kerala is facing, what can be termed as Brazil syndrome”, said eminent social activist P V Rajagopal. Delivering the inaugural address at the  , organized by the   of India on Wednesday, the eminent activist compared the present situation in the state to that in the South American nation. 

 "The unique situation in Brazil should be an eye opener to all. Despite having abundant resources, over 80% of the Brazilians are forced to live in the urban ghettos called Favela. The reason being that the land prices have been so much inflated beyond any logic that only the rich minority can afford them”, he said. ``Kerala too is following the suit. The price of land is inflated in such a way making it impossible for the common man to own land.”
 
 Rajagopal said that this situation is not limited to the state. “During my younger days, I knew about migrant taxi drivers from Bihar who could buy plot and raise a house in the city with meagre salaries. Now this is all but a dream. And some of the biggest sufferers of this situation are farmers, dalits and tribals who due to high economic pressures are driven out of their own lands,” he said.
 
 Rajagopal also mocked the attitude of banks which turn a blind eye towards the basic needs of the people. “I have asked many bank officials the reason why they are ready to provide lakhs of rupees as loan for buying a car but put so many hurdles when a person approaches for ten lakhs to build a house,” he said. The two day summit will hold several sessions regarding various aspects of land ownership and reforms
