Rajasthani folk singer and actress   not only lent her voice to the popular song 'Morni Baga Ma' from the movie 'Lamhe', which starred   and Anil Kapoor, but also featured in that particular song. She shares, “My career as a singer in   had just began when Lamhe happened.   heard my voice and not only offered me to sing for the song but also asked me to perform in it. I can be seen dancing to the number in the beginning of the song which was shot in the Sam sand dunes of Jaisalmer and also in between the song. I was extremely nervous, particularly because I was shooting with none other than Srideviji who was known for her dancing capabilities. I was amazed to see her dancing so effortlessly on the desert sand. Your feet sink into the desert sand which makes it difficult for a person to walk, forget about dancing! That song became a huge hit. Lamhe will always be close to my heart. The last time I happened to meet her was during the screening of ' ' when we bumped into each other. She greeted me with her infectious smile and hugged me. She was a woman of few words. Socha nahi tha ki woh itni jaldi chali jayengi.”
