PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has allowed an application to carry out extensive repairs to the   complex at  , Sattari, under the supervision of the public works department (PWD) engineer. It has, however, categorically stated that no new constructions were to be carried out.

 Parents of over 300 wards of Navodaya Vidyalaya at Valpoi had filed a writ petition seeking that the school complex either be repaired extensively, or the students be moved to another building. The court was told there were several cracks in the columns, beams and walls of almost all the buildings. It was also informed that most of the overhead tanks were broken and there was constant seepage in the toilet and kitchen blocks. Fittings and fixtures had corroded over time, too, the court was told, and most electricity switches and holders had become unoperational. 
 
 The petition stated that after the school was built in 1995, no repairs was carried out on the account of an ongoing dispute over ownership.
