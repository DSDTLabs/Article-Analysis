Fashion guru   doesn’t take the power of his precious   for granted. Ahead of the assembly   next month, he urges the youth to take the lead and vote in large numbers to ensure that they get the future they want. 

 "The last elections was my most memorable, because I couldn’t find my name on the voter’s list. I registered in   and was very upset when my name was missing. I went to almost every poll booth and finally found my name in  . I voted from there, because I didn’t want to give up my vote. I felt disenfranchised and was quite upset. This year, you can check this online, and I am glad that I found my name in Shanti Nagar. I feel very dispirited with the voter turnout in Bengaluru. If a majority of us do not vote, then we don’t get a majority of the opinions, and the results become very skewed and incorrect. I want to appeal to the youth — if you’re 18 and above, you have to vote. This is your heritage and country and you have to look after it carefully. If you don’t vote, what future do you have? If you are not of voting age, then make sure your family and friends vote. The youth should make the biggest noise about voting; this heritage is for them. We must think about how well this country is run, in terms of education, environment, corruption and jobs, as these are important issues that will impact the youth of the country. I feel that cynicism has crept into urban voters, who feel that it is parties with money and corrupt politicians who win. We don’t realise that our vote can change things — single votes add up to large numbers. And you don’t have to vote for a certain party; vote for individuals who have done a good job. This way, we can get good people into the system. We can’t be victims of cynicism and do nothing, because that attitude will rebound and hurt us later."
