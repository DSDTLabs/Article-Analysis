BHOPAL: Alarmed by the arrest of alleged right wing activists in the ISI espionage ring busted by police last week, the   has called a high-level meeting to counter the “propaganda” launched by Opposition parties. The   calls it a “conspiracy to get mileage during elections”.

 “We see a well-planned conspiracy behind naming RSS-VHP-BJP and organisations like   in the ISI espionage case. We do not support or rule out the involvement of the suspects arrested by police, but vehemently oppose the political game played by rival parties to involve saffron groups in the entire incident. We will alert all frontal groups to counter the false allegations of anti-national activities against our organisations,” VHP national vice-president Jiveshwar Mishra told TOI over phone. “This could happen anywhere, in Army or in civil, where individuals are lured by Pak-based agencies to work for them. But this does not mean that the nationalist society is also involved.” 
 
 The Sangh Parivar is in damage-control mode and has called the Delhi meet to launch a crisis management campaign. For a few days after the February 9 arrest, social media was abuzz with pictures of one of the suspects, Dhruv Saxena, with ministers and senior party leaders. Congress and AAP were quick to pounce on it. “Dhruv Saxena was the media cell in-charge of BJP and has been spotted in several pictures with chief minister   and BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya,” alleged AAP spokesperson Ashutosh on Thursday.
 
 The Sangh Parivar has denied this or that one of the suspects was an active member during Virat Hindu Sammelan organised in Betul on February 8. The saffronites say the spy ring bust has been “diverted towards BJP-RSS for political mileage”.
