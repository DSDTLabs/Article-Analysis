LUDHIANA: Irked with the problem of scarcity of funds with the municipal corporation for development works in the city, local MLAs have raised the demand for fixing a Rs 5-crore quota for each MLA in the annual budget of the state government, with which they could get works done at their level. MLAs claimed that like MPs, even they should get a fixed quota for development works of their respective constituencies.

 Recently, a pre-budget meeting was conducted, in which CM Captain   had sought suggestions from MLAs. In that meeting, MLAs had suggested fixing this quota, taking the plea that MC was already facing an acute shortage of funds, and councillors found it tough to get works done in the wards. At the same time, though MLAs are dependent on MC for works or projects in their constituencies, in the absence of funds, they face the wrath of the public. MLAs also said when funds get allocated to them, they would be able to plan the works accordingly.
 
 MLA Sanjay Talwar said there was no fixed quota at present for MLAs. For the development of their constituencies, they prepare projects and arrange funds through various departments. He said they had raised this demand with the CM, hoping to get it done in the state budget.
 
 Recently, the state government had announced several projects for the city on the demand of MLAs, but funds are being arranged with the help of other departments. Projects like installation of static compactors, development of leisure valleys, and construction of common effluent treatment plants are being done with the help of   (LIT),   (Glada), and even   (PPCB).
