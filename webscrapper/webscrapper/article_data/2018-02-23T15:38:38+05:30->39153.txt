NAGPUR: Complying with a local order to call off the farmers sit-in agitation at Katol, rebel   MLA   on Thursday announced that he was suspending the protests for the time being. But he will be holding a farmers’ rally at a sports centre there on Friday and has appealed farmers to gather on main streets on March 1 to lit Holi fires.

 “A local court has said in an order that the public agitation should be called off to avoid disturbance to students appearing for state board exams that started on February 21. Respecting the order we have suspended the agitation,” said Deshmukh. However, he noted that the weeklong agitation has failed to move the government so we would pursue the matter during the budget session of state legislature beginning next Monday.
 
 Hailstorm and unseasonal rains between February 11 and 13 damaged standing crops of Rabi wheat, gram and damaged orange and sweetlime orchards across Katol, Narkhed and Kalmeshwar tehsils. Guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule inspected the places the very next day and the district collector completed survey of damage within four days and sent it to government.
 
 Deshmukh was not satisfied with all this as he wanted chief minister Devendra   to visit the villages and assure people of government help. He also hosted former Union finance minister   and in his presence demanded Fadnavis’ resignation for failure to come to farmers’ rescue in his own home district. 
 
 While this was going on, notices of government action against the private medical college being run by the Deshmukh family leaked out as also another notice served to Ashish’s father Ranjit Deshmukh threatening attachment of one his properties in Nagpur against a bank loan default case. This made it clear that a political battle of sorts was on between the Deshmukh and the BJP-led state government.
