CHANDPUR RURKI:   national vice-president   held his son’s wedding reception at a ‘gaushala’ (cow shelter) in Kandhi area on Sunday. The function — meant to promote the rearing and protection of cows — was attended by several politicians and bureaucrats. 

 The  , run by  , houses around 2,200 cows. Alongside is a ground, which was decked for the reception of Khanna’s son and daughter-in-law. 
 
 Speaking about the unusual choice of venue, Khanna said, “Apart from creating awareness about cow rearing and protection, it would also help in re-establishing our ‘organic relationship’ with cows and nature. 
 
 If people start organising their festivities in gaushalas, it would improve the condition of the cow shelters greatly.” Meanwhile, chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath, during his visit to Vrindavan on Sunday, said it was imperative to “save the cow and Ganga” in order to save the country.
