Ludhiana: The area adjoining Jagraon Bridge — from where MC is supposed to remove illegal structures — is like a normal colony where people get government water supply, sewerage connections, and electricity connections. If these houses are developed upon Railways land illegally, then who allowed the connections in the area, and who should be held responsible for the encroachments?

 Civic officials claimed the land belonged to Railways, but they are silent about the facts as to how these people manage water supply and sewerage connections, and how were the roads constructed inside? There are concrete structures in the area. The encroachers in the colony said they had been residing there for the past several years, and they get electricity bills every month. The MC provided water supply connections, sewerage connections, and even roads were constructed by officials in the area. They claimed they had voter ID cards for this address, but there is no registry of these houses.
 
 Sources revealed civic officials were trying to save their skin, while saying that the land belonged to Railways, as they should have had paid attention towards the encroachments. However, civic officials — at the time of issuing connections or constructing roads — could easily judge that these were encroachments.
 
 One of the officials claimed it was usually under pressure that they provided basic facilities to residents, even if they were residing illegally at any place. He said: “Now, there are 97 encroachers in this land, and under pressure created by councillors or other politicians of that time, these facilities must have been provided to people.”
 
 When asked about this practice, Congress MP Ravneet Bittu said: “No doubt this practice exists, and there are shortcomings in the system. Now, I saw another construction taking place on the other side of this colony, and pointed it out to the officials to check it.” He added that there was a need to set the system right.
 
 However, MLA Bharat Bhushan Ashu said there was no political patronage to any of the encroachers, and if they came to meet these people, it was just because they did not want to make them homeless. He said they were doing this exercise on humanitarian grounds. “In future, we will fix responsibility of the department concerned and officials to curb the encroachments,” he added.
