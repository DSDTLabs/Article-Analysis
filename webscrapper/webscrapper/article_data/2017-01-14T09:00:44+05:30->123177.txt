PUNE: The   ( ) is planning to rope in retired army officials as guards and ‘discipline enforcers’ at its bus depots.

 The move has come as PMPML authorities have been made aware of certain indisciplined and high handed workers at the depots. The authorities told TOI that an effective way to make them toe the line was to put retired military personnel at the depots and terminals.
 
 “The fact that intimidation happens in the depots cannot be overlooked. There have been cases when an employee has used muscle power to dominate others at the depot. These people could be drivers or other employees. They report late to work and force the officials to mark their attendance at the scheduled time. People tend to agree out of fear. This causes many problems, which affect the timetable of the buses and causes delays. The PMPML wants to curtail all these and improve discipline in the office, workshops and depots,” a senior official at the transport body told TOI.
 
 PMPML at present operates 2,055 buses in the city.
 
 Anant Waghmare, general manager (operations), PMPML, said, “If   are roped in, it will solve many problems. They are disciplined and adhere to rules and regulations. There are many private security agencies having a team of ex-armymen working with them. They cannot be intimidated and will ensure discipline and order in the depots.” 
 
 The details are still being worked out, he added.
