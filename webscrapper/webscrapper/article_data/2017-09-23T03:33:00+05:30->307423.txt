Panaji: Town and country planning minister   Sardesai said that it was up to the Congress to decide whether Congress MLA and leader of opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar should continue as leader of the Congress legislature party. 

 “I am not in the Congress, and it is up to the Congress MLA to decide who should lead the CLP as it is their internal matter. It has nothing to do with us,” Sardesai said.
 
 Sardesai, however, said that it was of no consequence to the government if Kavlekar continued as the leader of the opposition as “there is no real opposition in Goa”. TNN
