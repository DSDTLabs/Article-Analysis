JALPAIGURI/KOLKATA: National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) members, who are in   to conduct a parallel probe in the  , have threatened to move court against associate officials in the district for non-cooperation.

 NCPCR additional secretaries Priyank Kanoongo and Yashwant Jain arrived in Jalpaiguri on Tuesday for the probe.
 
 “Despite sending a letter to the Bengal government officials much prior to our visit, we have not been provided with the documents we had sought. We will now issue summons as per Section 14(1)B of Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act 2005. If the Bengal government does not cooperate with us, we will prepare a case and move court,” Kanoongo said.
 
 District magistrate   claimed she had not received any letter.
 
 Jain said the Jalpaiguri trafficking racket was linked with that in Baduria in North 24-Parganas. “In Jalpaiguri, officials were not as vigilant as they should have been,” he said.
 
 “There has been gross violation of   Justice Act in Jalpaiguri,” Kanoongo said. “There was no   (CWC) here and an ad hoc committee would run the   before a legal committee came up in August 2015...This is an utter administration failure.”
 
 CID officials probing the case have indicated the agency will be summoning a BJP leader “soon” to record her statement.
