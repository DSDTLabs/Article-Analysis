Ahmedabad:   probing a   case arrested two more persons on Saturday. The accused had provided computers and voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) minutes to a call centre running in Ambawadi.

 On March 23, a team of Ellisbridge police had raided a call centre running on sixth floor of Cavania Complex near   in Ambawadi and had nabbed 10 persons, including a woman, for making calls to the US citizens posing as finance firms providing loans at lucrative rates and conditions. The callers were using VoIP to mask their original number and displaying the US number to the callers.
 
 “During our investigation, we got to know that the 10 computer systems used by the centre were provided by Amit Prajapati, 35, a resident of Nardipur near Kalol in Gandhinagar district at the rate of Rs 800 per month per computer. He had also facilitated procuring the VoIP minutes for the set-up,” said an investigator.
 
 Prajapati’s questioning revealed that he in turn had got the minutes from  , 24, a resident of Abu Road, Rajasthan. Sharma has also been arrested for further questioning. 
 
 Investigators are yet to understand the scope of the case as they have not come across financial documents showing the money the group made in two-and-a-half months and how they used to launder it. Police have identified a person who used to pay them in Indian rupees after getting the receipts in dollars, they added.
