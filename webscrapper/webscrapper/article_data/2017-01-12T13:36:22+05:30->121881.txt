VADODARA: Unlike China, India does not have the required infrastructure to engage Nobel laureates to teach in Indian education institutes, Nobel laureate   aka Venki said here on Wednesday. 

 “China has witnessed a dramatic improvement in its infrastructure for instance its cities like Beijing and Shanghai. But India does not have that kind of infrastructure. If any visiting professor comes, he or she has to stay here for a couple of weeks or months for that infrastructure improvement is necessary,” Venki said while interacting with media persons.
 
 An  , Venki had won the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2009. 
 
 However, he said that reverse brain drain is possible for India. 
 
 “Many top class Indian researchers who had moved out 50 years ago are coming back despite of the great difficulty which is a good sign,” he said. 
  
 “There are many first grade institutes right now in the country which weren’t there when I was studying,” said Venki.
 
 “Government should keep investing in science and simultaneously also work towards economic growth. As economy grows, there will be more funding to science and there will be improvement,” he said, adding that along with development, better research facilities are necessary for better research output. 
 
 “But this cannot happen overnight. It will take one or two generations,” he said, adding that science and management model have to be expanded to encourage research. 
 
 Venki also endorsed a cashless economy saying that less cash leads to less corruption.
 
 Earlier, in the day, Venki paid a surprise visit to the   at the D N Hall campus where he interacted with students.
