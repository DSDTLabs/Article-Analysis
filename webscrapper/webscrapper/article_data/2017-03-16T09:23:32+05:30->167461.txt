VADODARA: Nineteen-year-old Manju (name changed) was recently united with her husband by 181   after she left his house and her parents refused to accept her.

  said that Manju was forcefully married off by her parents two years back in a village in Shehra taluka of Panchmahals. She said that her husband and in-laws used to beat her up and made her do   forcefully. Tired of the harassment, she had left her husband’s house and went back to her parents.
 
 Instead of helping Manju, her parents refused to accept her and beat her up. They told her that since she is married she will have to live with her husband no matter what. Saddened by the situation, she contacted 181 helpline and requested them to help her out.
 
 Helpline counsellors advised her to register a police complaint and told her that she will get protection from the cops against violence by her husband as well as parents. Manju, however, refused to go to the police and instead requested the counsellors to unite her with her husband.
 
 The helpline officials contacted the sarpanch and elders of her husband’s village and told them about the torture Manju went through at her in-law’s house.   also counselled Manju’s husband and her in-laws following which they showed readiness to accept her and would not harm her in any way.
