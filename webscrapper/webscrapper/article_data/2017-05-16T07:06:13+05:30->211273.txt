Hyderabad:   moving from RTC Crossroads and Ashok Nagar towards Indira Park came to a grinding halt on Monday morning after massive protests erupted at  . 

 Commuters going towards Indira Park were forced to take alternative routes as over 5,000 people gathered at the   site to reclaim it. “I was stuck in traffic for close to 30 minutes near Ramakrishna Math while going to Osmania University on Monday morning due to the clash at Dharna Chowk. The mayhem led to traffic diversions,” said Ravi Teja Tankela, an OU student. 
 
 With protesters using the main road — running parallel to Indira Park — for parking their vehicles, motorists had a tough time making their way through the narrow space left on the adjacent lanes. 
 
 While close to 200 traffic personnel were deployed at various junctions along the six kilometre stretch from Ramakrishna Math to Osmania University, it failed to ease the congestion immediately. In fact, the cops had to hold back traffic for a minimum of five minutes at every signal to bring the situation under control.
 
 Incidentally, Indira Park is listed as one among the top five places in the city that witnesses maximum traffic congestion. On Monday, the situation was even worse. Commuters in nearby areas such as Domalguda and lower Tank Bund too were adversely affected. 
 
 “While navigating these areas is a challenge almost every day, it was particularly bad today. After one point, I lost track of time. The wait just seemed endless,” said B Suresh, a resident of the area who travels through these pockets regularly. Apart from traffic, he also complained of “noise pollution” that has become a part of their daily life.
