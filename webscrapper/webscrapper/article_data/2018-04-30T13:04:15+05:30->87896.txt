In the video posted on Tanya’s social media page, Mumtaz said, “Namaskar! I am Mumtaz. I felt weird and humbled that people remember me and worry about me even after so many years. I am lucky that I have your love even after such long time. Very few people are lucky enough to get such love.”

 Mumtaz further added, “But do not worry, I am good and my health is fine too. My kids take good care of my health and I am very happy. Unlike the newspaper reports, I am not at all lonely. I am very happy.” 
 
 Addressing the situation, Tanya reportedly said that since the rumours of her mother Mumtaz’s death were quite rife, she just wanted her fans to know the truth. And that she is doing brilliantly fine. She further added that her mother is staying with her in Rome. She even revealed about their day plans saying that they plan to do some gardening and hop to shopping later.
