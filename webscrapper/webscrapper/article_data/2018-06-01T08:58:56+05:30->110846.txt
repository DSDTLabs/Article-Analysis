PATNA: Police arrested Anjay Pandey (30) from the outskirts of his native village Srinagar under Maner police station area in Patna district on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday on charges of raping a 17-year-old girl at her residence at Gosain Tola under   police station area on May 27.

 
 Only the girl and her younger brother were inside the flat as their parents had gone out of the city when the incident occurred. The girl’s father, a professor, had removed Pandey, his driver, from the job last week. Police sources said Pandey raped the girl to avenge his dismissal from job.
 
 Patna   Manu Maharaaj said Pandey was hiding in cattle shed when the police arrested him around 2am. “The girl had attacked Pandey with a knife but was overpowered,” he said.
 
 “Pandey had brought a girl from Kolkata to his native village three years back and later deserted her. An FIR was registered against him in this connection too,” the SSP said, adding Pandey would soon be taken on police remand for interrogation. He said steps would be taken to ensure speedy trial in the case.
