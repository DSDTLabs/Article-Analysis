Greater Noida: The   has confirmed a promotional event for   Kumar-starrer   on Wednesday despite the police refusing to provide security for the programme that clashes with the opening of the Auto EXPO.

 The public works department has also denied   for the proposed venue for a makeshift helipad.
 
 University officials confirmed the event would be held as scheduled. “The event management company which is organising the event will go ahead with the same. Students have been called to the ground around10.00 am on Wednesday for the event,” said Awadhesh Kumar, the dean, planning,   university.
 
 Videos of Akshay inviting viewers to the event have been posted on YouTube in which the actor can be seen announcing his arrival to the university on February 7 with a Pad Man poster in the background. On Facebook, too, some students of the university have posted about Akshay’s attendance at the event.
 
 However, the Dankaur police, under whose jurisdiction the university falls, have said they would not be able to provide additional force for the event.
 
 “We will not be able to provide additional force for the event as the Auto EXPO is slated to begin the same day. Moreover, a part of the force will be busy in tackling protests against the alleged fake encounter of a gym trainer in Noida,” said Dankaur SHO Farmood Ali Pundhir.
 
 On the other hand, PWD’s executive engineer Vimal Kumar has said the venue chosen by the university for the helipad “does not have adequate space”.
 
 “They will have to look for another helipad in case they want to hold the event. We will approve any other helipad only once we inspect it. They are possibly looking at Gautam Budhha University now,” he said.
 
 Greater Noida city magistrate Rajesh Kumar, who has to issue the final permission, told TOI that holding the event “seems to be difficult”. “Police have denied the permission and the PWD has objected to the helipad. They are now looking for a change in the helipad venue,” he said.
