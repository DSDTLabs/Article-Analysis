Salem: In the nick of time assurance given by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Salem division, helped save its 10 buses from being confiscated by the Madras high court officials at Old Bus Stand in the city on Monday. 

 The court officials initiated the confiscation process after the TNSTC failed to pay compensation to the family of an accident victim despite the court order. 
 
 Initially, the legal officer arrived at the bus stand along with the petitioner and attached the buses parked at bays. The attached buses ply from Old Bus Stand to Kannankuruchi, Salem New Bus Stand and Railway Junction.
 
 The transport department failed to comply with the court order to pay compensation to the family of M Sabari, 20, of Thrivananthapuram in Kerala.
 
 “Three people, including Sabari, died after a government bus rammed a car in which Sabari and his friends were travelling in 2009,” a court official said.
 
 Later, family members of Sabari filed a case in the judicial magistrate court in Salem against the transport corporation demanding compensation. In 2012, the court in its order directed the transport corporation to pay a compensation of Rs 9 lakh to the petitioner. As the TNSTC failed to pay the compensation, the petitioner approached the Madras high court. 
 
 The high court ordered the TNSTC-Salem division to pay Rs 30.93 lakh as compensation to the petitioner in 2017.
 
 But, corporation officials failed to pay it. The petitioner again approached the court a couple of months ago and got an order to attach the buses. “Now the TNSTC has to pay Rs 30.93 lakh with interest,” the court official said.
 
 Meanwhile, the TNSTC officials initiated peace talks with court officials. They assured the court officials that they would pay the compensation within two days. Convinced over their words, the court officials dispersed the spot leaving the buses.
