Surat: Police commissioner Satish Sharma on Wednesday suspended 10 policemen for their negligence in the case of a murder and loot accused escaping from their custody. 

 Sharma has ordered an inquiry by assistant commissioner of police (ACP) F division into the incident that took place on Tuesday. The policemen were taking the accused, Amar Solanki, in a police bus from the district and sessions court in Athwalines to Lajpore Central Jail on the city’s outskirts. There were 13 cops in the bus and 10 were assigned the responsibility of safely transferring 17 undertrials in the vehicle.
 
 The cops were sitting in the front seat while all the accused were sitting in the rear seats. Seeing that no one was keeping an eye on them, Solanki escaped from the bus. Preliminary inquiry by senior officials revealed that he could have escaped from the emergency door when the vehicle stopped or slow down. 
 
 The bus was brought to city police commissionerate on Wednesday and examined by top officials. The team that was carrying the accused was also questioned and preliminary details about the incident was collected by the city police commissioner.
 
 “It looks that the policemen were negligent in their duty and did not keep an eye on those in the bus. The entire team has been suspended and an inquiry has been ordered,” said Sharma. Meanwhile, police have launched a manhunt for Solanki but there is no clarity about the exact location from where he fled. Earlier it was suspected that he could have escaped immediately after coming out of the court. However, that possibility has been ruled out by senior officials. It is believed that Solanki had escaped en route Lajpore jail.
