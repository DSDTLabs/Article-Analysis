Vadodara: The bullet train station in the city may come up between the Alkapuri and Jetalpur railway under-bridges. It was being planned earlier that the station would come up on the western side of the railway station above the existing platform number six. The possibility of constructing the bullet train terminal towards the Jetalpur underpass was discussed during a meeting of senior officials of the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC), Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), officials of the Vadodara division of the Western Railway, city police and others. VMC commissioner Vinod Rao said that the possibility of the station at the site was discussed and agreed in principal. He added that if the station was constructed at the site, it could have approach from both east and west of the railway tracks and bullet train corridor.  The possible approaches to the bullet train station and traffic movement due to it was also discussed. It was suggested that the Jetalpur underbridge should be widened to take care of the traffic that would come to the area in wake of the bullet train. Rao said that the bullet train project may change the face of the entire station area. “The state transport depot, multi-nodal transport hub ‘Jan Mahal’, the existing railway station and the bullet train terminal would all come in the same stretch,” he said. Sources said that the NHSRC was planning to have an elevated railway platform for the bullet train. Two new roads are being planned in the area apart from a new railway underpass. Sources said that a major portion of the bullet train corridor in the city will be elevated. It will also come up in the margins along the railway tracks already owned by the railways.
