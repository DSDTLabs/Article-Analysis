SURAT: City police commissioner   has issued yet another circular after his ‘salute your seniors’ to improve the performance of the police stations. He has asked senior officers to inspect any police station of their choice once in a week, but it should not be located in their jurisdiction. This has been made compulsory for all the officers of city police.

 Sharma has ordered officers of   (ACP) and above ranks to start the practice with the beginning of the New Year and ensure that the police stations function properly. The officers are supposed to submit a report on their inspections to the police commissioner with issues and suggestions. In the past, routine inspection of police stations by senior officers was revised by Sharma to improve the functioning of police stations. 
 
 The police officers have been asked to assess the police stations on 12 parameters and file their reports accordingly. The police stations will be checked for cleanliness, turnout of cops, maintenance of visitor’s book and response time and satisfaction of citizens who come there with complaints.
 
 “ACPs and above rank officers should inspect at least one police station located outside their jurisdiction in a week and ensure it remains a surprise inspection. They will have to submit a report after inspecting the police station on 12 suggested parameters,” Sharma said.
 
 “We are doing this to improve the overall performance of police stations. Along with citizens, we want to ensure that our policemen also work in a congenial atmosphere,” Sharma added.
