 After the crew’s efforts to stop the flooding proved futile, they raised an SOS alarm on VHF radio, seeking help from the Indian Coast Guard. The ICG ship Arinjay operating in the area responded to the distress call and proceeded towards the sinking trawler.
 
 On arriving at the scene, a boarding team was dispatched in the ship’s raft to ascertain the extent of damage. The distressed trawler was then secured alongside the ship and the ship’s damage control team rendered support. Two submersible pumps and a diesel-driven pump were used to de-flood the engine room and the hole was plugged using damage-control material. 
 
 The trawler’s crew was examined by Arinjay’s medical assistant and given fresh water, tea and refreshments. After the operation, the boat was handed over to another Indian fishing boat, Al Madina, at 6am on Wednesday, for onward passage to Okha under tow.
