Chandigarh: The assembly on Tuesday saw a rare instance of a legislator critique his own party’s government when Gurugram MLA   spoke out against amendment to the affordable housing scheme in the 2031 Gurugram Master Plan.

 As Aggarwal criticised the government and the town and country planning department, Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu, who replied to questions in the absence of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, admitted some lapses in the issuance of licences for affordable housing. He also assured appropriate action after completion of the probe into the matter while responding to Aggarwal’s questions during question hour in the state assembly.
 
 Aggarwal is one of the nine MLAs from southern Haryana to have spoken out against the government, alleging that they were being ignored by officers, ministers and the chief minister’s office (CMO). The number of dissidents has now gone up to 18.
 
 Aggarwal asked if the government had made changes or increased the area of affordable housing projects from 300 acres to 500 acres in the Gurgaon master plan for 2031, which is yet to be finalised. He asked whether any bias had been detected against any builder while issuing licences.
 
 Abhimanyu asserted that there was no change in the Gurgaon master plan. “There is always a scope for change in the infrastructure. The government has not received any complaint in the matter so far,” Abhimanyu maintained. Soon after Abhimanyu’s reply, Aggarwal expressed displeasure while elaborating on the complaint lodged by him with the chief minister and other offices. “I wonder how builders can prepare the draft ahead of finalisation of the policy. Complaints lodged by me are still pending at various levels. Neither the previous government, nor this one has ordered any probe to ascertain the shortcomings. They (builders) have been given licences instead,” said Aggarwal.
