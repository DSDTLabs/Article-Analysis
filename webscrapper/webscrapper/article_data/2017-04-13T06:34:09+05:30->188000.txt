AHMEDABAD: As concerns grow about air pollution and the effect it has on  , Amdavadis will soon get   on their mobile phones, including forecasts for the next three days. This ambitious system will be in place by the first week of May. 

  Five agencies — Indian Institute of Tropical Meterology, IIPH-Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC),   (NRDC) and Isro — have partnered to set up 11 pollution monitoring stations, at respirable level, across the city. 
 
 This project will set up an   (AIR) plan for the city, just like the heat action plan in place since 2011.
 
 The AIR plan system will provide Amdavadis a real-time air quality index (AQI) of different areas of the city through the SAFAR mobile app, alerting citizens to current pollution levels and predictions for the next three days.
 
 On Wednesday, the agencies held a stakeholders meeting at AMC’s Usmanpura office, to strategize on conducting awareness programmes, sensitizing vulnerable groups with respiratory disorders about taking precautions and capacity building of the urban health infrastructure in the city. 
 
 “We will involve schools in a big way and also research institutes for field studies using the AQI data,” said AMC health official Chirag Shah. The AQI provided by the SAFAR app will provide information on eight major pollutants with their sub-indices. 
 
 “This includes particulate matter pollution PM10, PM2.5, PM1, oxides of nitrogen and suphur, carbon monoxide, ozone, benzene, ammonia and lead,” said IIPH director Dileep Mavlankar.
