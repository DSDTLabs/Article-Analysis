Chandigarh: In a relief to ex-servicemen in the state, Haryana government has decided to enhance the ignorable part of pension from Rs 4,000 to Rs 15,000 in case of commissioned officers and civil officers holding Group ‘A’ posts. The government has also approved the new pay fixation policy of re-employed military pensioners in the state.

 Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar approved the proposal in this regard. He said in all cases where pension was fully ignored, the initial pay on re-employment would be fixed as per entry pay in the revised pay level of the re-employed post, applicable in case of direct recruits appointed on or after January 1, 2016, according to the Haryana Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2016.
 
 He said in cases where the entire pension and pensionary benefits were not ignored for pay fixation, the initial basic pay on re-employment would be fixed at the same stage as the last basic pay drawn before retirement. “If there is no such stage in the re-employed post, the pay would be fixed at the stage above that pay,” said Abhimanyu.
 
 The finance minister said if the maximum pay in the level applicable to the post in which a pensioner is re-employed is less than the last basic pay drawn by him before retirement, his initial basic pay would be fixed at such maximum pay of the re-employed post. Similarly, if the minimum pay in the level applicable to the post in which military pensioner is re-employed is more than the last basic pay drawn by him before retirement; his initial basic pay would be fixed at such minimum pay of the re-employed post.
