  Expressing yourself through your fashion choices.

  A saree and a backless dress.
 
  A plain white T-shirt, a pair of well-fitted denims, a belt, a nice summer dress, an LBD, a pair of heels that go with everything, a scarf and a nice shade of red lipstick.
 
 My phone charger, phone, hand sanitiser, house keys and lip balm.
 
 A crop top with leather skirt and a choker.
 
  A business suit or a skirt with a formal shirt. 
 
 Ripped jeans or shorts and a comfortable shirt, or maybe a cute jumpsuit. Sport shoes for sure. 
 
 A sheer one piece.
 
 I never have a strategy for shopping! I just pick up what I like.
 
  Apply pure almond oil on your body before going to bed every night. Eat right, drink essential amounts of water, apply vaseline on your eyelashes before going to bed, as they definitely grow longer!
 
  My favourite T-shirt over a pair of comfortable denims and a jacket.
 
  Bold stripes and off shoulders.
 
  Metallic pointed heels and a pair of casual sneakers.
 
 
 
 
 :   and   – the way they carry themselves and experiment is amazing!
