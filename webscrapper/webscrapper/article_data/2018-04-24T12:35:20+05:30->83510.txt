ZIRAKPUR: Deadlock between the   over garbage disposal is still not allowing the sanitation staff to use a government-owned landfill near this residential area. 

 The   has sought police assistance for hassle-free garbage disposal on the panchayat land owned by the   government. Two days ago, the area residents who resist dumping in their backyard had forced a trash trailer and sanitation team to go back.
 
 In the complaint that Zirakpur sanitation inspector confirmed Rajinder Singh lodged with the Bishanpura police on Friday (April 20), he reported "serious obstacles in disposing of garbage on the   land because nearby residents create trouble". Police called up the alleged ruckus makers near the landfill to counsel them. Rajinder Singh confirmed that he had made the complaint. He said: "I mentioned in it that the MC had been dumping garbage on this site for the past 15 years."
 
 He said that two days ago, a few residents had tried to attack the sanitation team accompanying the garbage trailer in Bishanpura. "The team was forced to retreat and dump the waste at another site," the sanitation inspector said. "For the past 17 days, the sanitation department has not collected garbage from the residential and commercial areas, since the MC doesn't have a dumping site."
 
 The villagers of Bishanpura complain that they were forced to resist the sanitation team because the MC wasn't making arrangements to level the landfill and bury the waste under soil and chemicals to avoid an epidemic. A villager said: "The state government has hired a company named Max to collect the garbage from the area. A land allocation issue has kept the company from starting the process." The MC made temporary arrangements for garbage disposal in Bishanpura, while the waste-garbage processing plant of Lalru is not operational.
