NEW DELHI: A meeting between officials of   (NRB) and India's finance and external affairs ministry last week brought no solution to Nepal's Indian currency woes. The NRB team, led by Chintamani Siwakoti, discussed ways to overcome the currency crisis, which senior Nepalese officials said was getting serious. 

  Nepal became collateral damage of India's   project, but there appears to be little sense of urgency in the government to devise relief measures for the neighbouring country. Speaking to TOI , Nepalese ambassador Deep Kumar Upadhyay said, "Nepal buys Rs 600 crore in Indian currency from India every year, which is given in four tranches. But the last couple of months have seen no money coming to Nepal from India. It's becoming very difficult." Last week, RBI sent across Rs 100 crore to Kathmandu. 
 
  Nepal's foreign minister Prakash Sharan Mahat will be in Delhi this week to speak at the Raisina Dialogue, the premier foreign policy event of the government. He is expected to underline the need to find a solution to this problem. Nepal PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' had spoken to PM   in November. In December, NRB officials were quoted as saying that Nepal had disallowed the use of Indian currency until a solution was found. 
 
  Indian currency is not quite legal tender in Nepal but is used widely, which means a large number of people have old notes with them that now have to be exchanged by the Indian government. 
 
  One of the problems that has to be overcome while exchanging the old notes in Nepal with new Indian currency is the existence of counterfeit notes. 
 
 Nepal, particularly its border regions, has become a conduit for FICN. On the other hand, the Indian government, while promoting digital and cashless systems in India, has shown little initiative in promoting the same in Nepal.
