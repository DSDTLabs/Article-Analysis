The  , named Shalini Singh, was shouting slogans when she was immediately detained by women police and taken outside the venue. She told journalists standing outside that she had come to complain to the PM against the Akhilesh Yadav government in UP which had done nothing to develop her village. She said her husband was a former RSS pracharak and she has been trying to develop her village which does not have even basic amenities. Singh further said that she had tried to raise the issue with the UP government but no one was responding to her appeals. Hence, she wanted to complaint to the PM, Shalini Singh said. Virendra Singh Yadav, SP, Gandhinagar, said that in her primary questioning, Singh had told police that she wanted to represent her issues to the PM on the platform where so many dignitaries were present. “She claimed that she did not know protocol and thus had come forward. Security personnel acted as per protcol. No police action has been taken against her,” he said. tnn
