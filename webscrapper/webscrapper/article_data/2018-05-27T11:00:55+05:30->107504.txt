LUCKNOW: A day after Shiv Sena chief   Thackeray slammed CM   for not removing his footwear while garlanding a portrait of Chhatrapati Shivaji during a rally in Virar earlier this week, the latter shot back on Saturday saying that he was much more ‘sanskari’ (cultured) than the Sena chief.

 
 The face off between the two leaders had come to the fore during campaigning for Palghar parliamentary seat byelection.
 
 “Wo mujhe na sikhayein. Main unse zyada sanskari hun(He need not teach me...I am more cultured than him),” Yogi said, while addressing reporters.
