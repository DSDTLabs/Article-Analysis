  : Noted social activist   on Saturday lashed out at the Naidu government for passing an amended   which did away with consent of landholders. 

 Speaking to media after participating in a meeting organised by the   (APRCS) in the city, she said the bill passed in the state assembly is against the interests of farmers. "The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, was a result of several agitations by farmers' associations, voluntary organisations and other groups. It had provided provisions keeping in view the interest of landholders. But the move by  's government is not only violating the provisions of the original act, but is also anti-farmer," she said.
