BENGALURU: Thursday’s Karnataka bandh seemed to have provided a long weekend, what with Republic Day following the next day. And Bengalureans heading out of the city on Wednesday took Metro to reach various transit hubs in the city, creating a new ridership record.

  said 4,11,601 people travelled on Metro on Wednesday with Purple Line (east-west corridor) registering 2.32 lakh ridership and   (north-south corridor) 1.79 lakh ridership. This is the highest ever ridership for Namma Metro after the commissioning of Phase 1.
 
 The previous record was on September 28 when an India-Australia cricket match was played in Bengaluru. The ridership stood at 4.10 lakh, including 2.37 lakh in Purple Line and 1.72 lakh in Green Line.
 
 Commuters have been demanding BMRCL to increase frequency and number of coaches. BMRCL had promised three additional coaches with one coach reserved for women for at least one or two trains by December 2017. However, last month, BMRCL said the east-west corridor (Purple Line) is expected to get first train with six coaches, and one coach will be reserved for women by the end of January.
 
 Passengers are irked with the delay in inducting additional coaches. K Venugopal, a regular passenger, said: “People, especially senior citizens, struggle to travel as there’s not even enough space to stand. Trains are overcrowded during non-peak hours as well.”
 
 Sources in the Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML), which received the contract to supply 150 cars, said one train will soon get additional coaches. “Coaches are ready and BMRCL will have to finalize a date for inauguration after consulting with the chief minister’s office,” said an official.
 
 BMRCL official U V   was unavailable for comment.
 
 BEML officials said they will supply six to nine Metro cars per month from June 2018. BEML has established one more line of production to increase the supply and complete supply of all the 150 cars before the scheduled date of December 2019.
