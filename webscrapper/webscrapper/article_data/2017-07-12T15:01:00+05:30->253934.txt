MARGAO: Town and country planning (TCP) minister   on Tuesday said that the police have obtained “substantial” clues on the Curchorem desecration cases and that “they will act to prevent recurrence of such cases.”

 “From today, there will be visible police presence that will act as a deterrent,” he said after holding a meeting with senior officers of the district administration and the state police with regards to the spate of desecration incidents and rise in theft cases in Fatorda.
 
 Amidst demands made from certain quarters that the cases of desecration be investigated by the CBI, Sardesai, on Tuesday, strongly batted in favour of the Goa police to probe the cases.
 
 “Only Goa police can detect these cases. Imported police won’t be able to that, as only Goa police can understand the psyche of the Goans. If the police get the right kind of encouragement, they will be able to detect the cases,” Sardesai said.
 
 “There are certain constraints which prevent the police from giving their 100 percent for various reasons,” Sardesai added, “and the government needs to find solutions for this”. He also rubbished allegations that some political parties were behind such incidents. “No political party can do these types of things. It could be a gang which is doing this, but nobody has any right to point fingers at anybody (without credible evidence)”, he said. Former minister Francisco Pacheco had accused   to be behind the incidents of vandalism.
 
 Among measures that were discussed at the meeting were: taking steps to make all CCTVs functional, making mandatory for multi-dwelling units to have CCTVs, ensuring designated strength of police at all police stations, etc. Sardesai also made a strong pitch for a separate police station for Fatorda. “It’s a departmental proposal pending for long,” he said. South Goa collector Swapnil Naik was also present.
