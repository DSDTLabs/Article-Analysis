VADODARA: The   may change the face of the entire station area. 

 Officials of the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC),   ( ) and Vadodara division of the western railways visited the site and discussed possible plans.
 
 Sources said that the NHSRC was planning to have an elevated railway platform for the bullet train and this would result in a sea change on the western side of the railway station towards Alkapuri. Two new roads are being planned in the area apart from a new railway underpass.
 
 VMC commissioner   said that the possibility of having a new underpass towards Kadakbazaar was discussed. The existing underpass can be used for traffic towards Sayajigunj from Alkapuri while the new one can be used for the traffic from the opposite direction. The existing underpass would also be strengthened.
 
 The officials also discussed the possibility of having a road connect the Alkapuri side of the railway station to the Shastri Bridge. Also, the idea of a road connecting the R C Dutt Road to the road leading to Genda Circle from the station was examined. A multi-level parking lot is being considered in the Faramji Compound in Alkapuri.
 
 VMC officials said that the pedestrian underpass being constructed from the urban transport hub ‘Jan Mahal’ could also be extended to the bullet train station. Rao said that this would in the real sense integrate the transport services in the city.
 
 Sources said that a major portion of the bullet train corridor in the city will be elevated. It will also come up in the margins along the railway tracks already owned by the railways.
