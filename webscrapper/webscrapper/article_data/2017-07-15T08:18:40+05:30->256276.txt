New Delhi: A gang of five opened fire at a   team when the latter arrived in the midst of an   burglary in   early Friday morning. 

 Around 3.30am, three men had cracked open the Central Bank of India ATM near the Acharya Niketan market in Mayur Vihar Phase 1 while two others waited in a   outside. The men inside were trying to remove the cash box when the police team intercepted them. Those in the car sped off while the rest ran in different directions. During the flight, one of them fired once at the pursuing policemen. Fortunately, nobody was hit. 
 
 The whole incident was captured by a   camera. However, all five managed to escape. 
 
 Police said the gang had first tied up and gagged the guard, Rakesh Kumar. They then broke open the machine with a crowbar. But they couldnâ€™t remove the cash box as it got locked as soon as the outer cover was removed. 
 
 A case was registered at Pandav Nagar police station. The guard was admitted to a hospital and would be questioned about the sequence of events.
