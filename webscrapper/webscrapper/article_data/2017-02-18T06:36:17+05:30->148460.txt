SECUNDERABAD: Interior decorator R Ajay Reddy recently received multiple injuries on his eyes and legs when he fell from his two-wheeler on account of a deep pothole near R K Puram flyover and All Saint’s Road. A resident of   in Malkajgiri, Reddy takes this stretch everyday. A Sainikpuri resident, Kurma Raju, has faced similar experiences in the past. These are by no means isolated stories.

 On an average, at least three people suffer accidents on the RK Puram flyover and All Saint’s Road as well as the stretch from Safilguda railway track to Shivalayam Road ( ) everyday, thanks to their deplorable condition. Nearly 1 lakh commuters travel on these two stretches.
 
 The length of the first stretch is 800 metres, of which a 200-metre portion is strewn with potholes. “Journey on this stretch is horrible and takes at least eight to 10 minutes. My four-wheeler gets damaged and I spend nearly Rs 3,000 per month to maintain it,” S Dhanunjay, a businessman at Paradise told TOI. 
 
 Despite the problems faced by so many people, neither the Secunderabad Cantonment Board nor officials of the   and buildings department have taken up repairs. “If they want to conduct repairs, the officials have to take it up during the summer season before it starts to rain,” said Bhaskar Reddy, a resident of Safilguda.
