MUMBAI: The   has refused relief to a standard X student of  ,  , who used white ink to correct his answers in the National Talent Search (NTS) Examinations. The student, who failed the exam, had approached the court asking it to direct the authorities to consider the corrected answers which will help him in passing the  

 The court referred to the rules which barred any overwriting or cancelling of answers once they are recorded. Since the answersheet checking is done by the computer, it treats overwritten answers as NIL, the court was told. The student’s plea that his answersheet should be manually checked was rejected by the bench of Justice Vidyasagar Kanade and Justice Chandrakant Bhadang. “In our view, the student having scratched the response which was given by him and rectified his answer, is not entitled to get any marks for answering the said questions,” said the judges. “There is no provision of manually checking the answer sheets. If such a request is granted then thousands will apply on that ground. We are, therefore, not inclined to entertain this petition,” added the judges.
 
 The student had appeared for the NTS examination in November 2016. The cut off marks for passing is 115 and he scored 114 marks. He sought his answersheet and pointed out that he had given 119 correct answers but was given only 114 marks. The authorities then pointed out that in five questions, he had marked wrong answers and subsequently corrected it using white ink. “The instructions which appear on the question paper very clearly state that the answer once recorded cannot be cancelled. The candidates were given clear instructions not to scratch any answer,” said the HC and dismissed the petition.
