CHANDIGARH: The sanitation workers in  , who were on protest for the past two weeks, called off their protest on Thursday after the state government conceded to most of their demands, including increase in salary and allowances. 

 The sanitation workers ended their 16-day   after a meeting of workers' union with urban local bodies' minister   and minister of state for welfare of scheduled castes and backward classes Krishan Kumar Bedi. 
 
 The chief minister's media adviser   and principal secretary R K Khullar were also present in the meeting.
 
 Minister Jain said all workers involved in sanitation and sewerage related works would be paid Rs 13,500 monthly salary. She added that some other kind of allowances would also be paid to these workers. 
 
 Similarly, the government has also agreed to the sanitation workers' demands, including abolition of outsourcing policy and to take steps in implementation of equal pay for equal work.
 
 Around 5,000 employees of municipal department in the state and around 25,000 sanitation workers were on strike for the past around 14 days. The strike had forced residents to live amid heaps of garbage and stink.
 
 The main demand of these protesting sanitation workers was implementation of equal pay for equal work, abolition of outsourcing system for all workers including those engaged in sewerage related works and regularisation of services of temporary employees.
 
 Initially, the sanitation workers began a three-day strike on May 9. 
 
 Three days later, they decided to extend the strike till May 14 and on May 17, they went on an indefinite strike after the talks with the government failed to yield positive result.
 
 Prior to Thursday's meeting, talks between the state government and the representatives of the striking employees on past two occasions had failed.
