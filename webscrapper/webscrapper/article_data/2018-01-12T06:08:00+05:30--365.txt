GHAZIABAD: An IGNOU researcher,   (29), who had gone missing from   University (JNU) on January 8, returned to his home in   on Thursday. Mukul’s family members confirmed that he had returned to his home on his own.

 “Mukul returned home on Thursday morning. He returned on his own. He is perfectly healthy. We are yet to talk to him to get details as to where he had gone for the past three days. He is a bit tense. We want him to relax,” Mukul’s elder sister,  , told TOI.
 
 Mukul was last seen on a CCTV camera near the east gate of the varsity at 12.30 pm on Monday. His phone and other belongings were found in the laboratory where he used to work. His friends told cops that he left in a hurry after receiving a call. Mukul’s neighbours in   said he returned at around 12.30 pm. “Mukul’s mother was not at home when he returned. He took rest for a few minutes in front of their house. He was carrying a blanket along with him. He was visibly tense. We gave him tea and water. A few minutes later his mother arrived and both of them went inside the house. They went out together later on after locking their house,” Rohit Sharma, a neighbour, said.
 
 A missing person’s complaint was registered by Delhi police who had also initiated a probe. Mukul was not a regular student of JNU and was being co-guided by a varsity professor in his research work. He commuted to Delhi on a daily basis from his home in Ghaziabad.
