Kolkata:   FC are all set to rope in former   and   striker   in order to strengthen their squad before the crucial matches in the  .

 Although Aizawl FC are not in running for the title, they are eyeing a top-four finish in the tournament. The defending I-League champions will also be making their debut in the AFC Cup next month and the management wants the team to put on a decent show under new coach Santosh Kashyap.
 
 At present they are placed sixth on the I-League table with 18 points from 14 matches and should Chidi join the club, it will give the team’s forward line a much needed boost. The team has scored only 14 goals so far in the league and their much-hyped Japanese striker Yugo Kobayashi had been a huge flop.
 
 According to club sources, the Nigerian striker is being signed in place of Kareem Nurain, who has been sidelined after being injured during the match against NEROCA FC. Chidi last played in India in the 2013-14 season for East Bengal and it was during a match against Mohammedan Sporting that he scored his 100th goal in the country.
 
 The team is also strengthening their defence and has already signed Lalchhawnkima on loan from Mumbai City FC. Lalchhawnkima, popularly known as Kimkima, was with Aizawl FC in the 2015-16 season and had done well for the people’s club. He joined the team during the last match against Indian Arrows in Goa and will be available to play against their northeast rivals Shillong Lajong on Monday.
