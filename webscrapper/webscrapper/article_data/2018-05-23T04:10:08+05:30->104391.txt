MUMBAI: A newborn girl was found abandoned in a heap of garbage in a village in   on Monday night. 

 
 The child’s umbilical cord was intact. The baby was rescued by two men— Sanjay Meher and Kun- dan Churi—residing in   village in Palghar. 
 
 Meher and   were hea- ded home from work when they noticed the baby lying in the gar- bage at  . “They rescued the child befo- re water from the nearby drain was about to swamp the baby,” said a police official. Churi wrapped the baby in his shirt and rushed her to a pri- mary health centre. 
 
 The men then informed the   police. Since the baby’s health was deteriorating, she was moved to Dr Dhawale Charitable Hospital at Palghar. Assistant police in- spector Siddhawa Jayabhave re- ached the hospital and agreed to bear the newborn’s medical ex- penses. 
 
 A doctor said the child’s condition is improving. The police started contac- ting maternity homes for infor- mation on newborns. “It is likely that the baby may have been born in a home and then abando- ned. We will give reward to anyo- ne who gives information about the mother,” said an officer.
