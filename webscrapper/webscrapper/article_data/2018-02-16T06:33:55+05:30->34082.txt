KOLKATA: Thousands have been affected by the enteric outbreak so far in the   but very few of them are getting proper treatment, thanks to the depleted state of the Bagha Jatin  . The 100-bed facility seems to be busting at seams with the rush of enteric patients. With only 22 doctors on shifts, the health department has deputed five more and six nursing staffers to tide over the situation.

 The hospital was almost defunct even a few years ago. The Trinamool government revamped the hospital about three years ago. But sources admit that the hospital needs better infrastructure, manpower and facility to handle a crisis situation.
 
 “The number of patients with enteric diseases is coming down gradually. But the hospital definitely needs more manpower and enhanced infrastructure to handle such an outbreak,” said a source in the hospital.
 
  
 In last two days, the hospital had 189 patients — all from Bagha Jatin areas — with enteric complaints. While 42 patients are admitted currently, three were referred to ID Hospital, Beliaghata.
 
 In December, the hospital had 4,857 OPD patients and admitted 266 more. From February 9, the hospital has attended to 2005 enteric patients and admitted 127 others.
 
 “The hospital is good when it comes to maternity cases and general ailments. But they seem inexperienced in dealing with enteric cases. Otherwise, why didn’t they admit Biswajit Das on Wednesday morning itself?” wondered Ranjit Das, a local.
 
 The hospital, however, refuted the charges and claimed that it was Das’s family who wanted to take him away. “The hospital is equipped to handle enteric cases. We have issued a general guideline on treatment protocol and medication to be on the safe side,” said Dr Ajay Chakraborty, health services director.
