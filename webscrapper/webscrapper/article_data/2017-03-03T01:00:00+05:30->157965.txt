While we often talk about how women have moved ahead in various walks of life, director   says that more often than not, it is not true. The debutant, who begins his innings with the woman-centric ' ', says, “My producer partner   and I were discussing story ideas when she started talking about her journey and experiences. We realised that despite all the talk of women’s empowerment, they are still treated differently, irrespective of which part of the world or background they come from.” 

  
 That set the basis for their movie and as the script developed, search began for the right actors to play the principal characters. About choosing   as the female protagonist, Keshhav says, “I wanted an actress who didn’t have any set image. We did a look test and auditioned her and felt that she would do justice to the character, Alia.” 
 As for the male leads, he adds, “The character of royal, Kunwar Vikram Pratap Singh, is unpredictable and I thought that   would bring that edginess to it.   has a great personality too, he is charming and a good actor. So, he was the best choice to play   businessman and philanthropist. For the younger, cute and handsome Alex, I felt Himanshu Kohli was apt. Having seen   since my childhood days, I thought he’s perfect to play Shaukat Ali Mirza ‘Karachiwale’.”
 Keshhav promises not only an engaging story, but also a visual treat as the movie has been shot across 200 locations, both in India and abroad.
