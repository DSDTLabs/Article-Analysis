 â€œIt took three months to conceptualise, shoot and add the graphic elements.The forest in the documentary is real while the animals - black panther, Indian wolf, tiger, sloth bear, deer, crocodile, elephant, monkey, etc - are animated versions," Prashant Jaadhav of Jaadhav Cinematographers said. The Jungle Book book was chosen because it's popular and students connect with it, he added.
 
 The documentary sends the message that 'nature will protect you if you protect nature'. It's the responsibility of everyone of protecting the environment from pollution by using the minimum amount of chemicals and pesticides and proper garbage treatment. Everything will be contaminated if the environment is polluted. The documentary appeals to children to plant more trees and take care of them.
 
 Prashant, an automobile engineer, and his architect brother Gurunath worked on the documentary. They thanked Fr Basil Vago, principal, St Paul's School, for giving permission to Neil to grow his hair longer than what's usually permitted by the school for the duration of the project.
 
 Fr Vago said the theme is very appealing. He congratulated Neil and Jaadhav Cinematographers for this documentary with a social message.
