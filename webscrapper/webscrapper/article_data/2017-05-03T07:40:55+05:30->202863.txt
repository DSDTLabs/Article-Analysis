GUWAHATI: The Kamrup (Metro) district administration has ordered the superintending engineer of PWD to complete all   on   before May 15. 

 Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioner M Angamuthu said all major city roads like GS Road, MG Road and RGB Road are in bad shape, causing inconvenience to commuters and hindering traffic movement. "So, I have directed the superintending engineer, PWD(R), Guwahati, to take necessary steps for repair, restoration and refurbishing of all damaged roads along with road safety markings, trimming and pruning of trees within May 15," said Angamuthu.
 
 The officers of Guwahati and Dispur revenue circles have been directed to supervise and ensure completion of work within the stipulated time. 
 
 "The officials concerned do not follow the norms as a result of which the condition of roads become bad within a short period of time. We have been complaining about this for a long time," said a resident of the Ganeshguri area.
 
 The DC has also asked the circle officers of Dispur and Sonapur to take necessary steps for clearing encroachments in the stretch from Khanapara to Jorabat along NH-37. "Severe waterlogging has been observed in the stretch of NH-37 in recent times because of blocking of natural channels and illegal encroachments in that stretch of the highway. If such kind of strict regulatory measures are not taken, the waterlogging problem in the area will not be mitigated," said the DC.
 
 The project director of NHAI has been directed to make necessary logistical arrangements for smooth execution of work.
