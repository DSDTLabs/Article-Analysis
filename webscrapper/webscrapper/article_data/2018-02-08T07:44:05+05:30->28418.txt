LUCKNOW: The   executive committee refused to lay down the budget for the upcoming financial year complaining that it got the budget copies late and did not get the time to go through it. In a rare event in its history, the LMC had to eventually call off the   scheduled on Tuesday. 

 The executive committee members pointed out that as per LMC House norms, they should have got the budget copies at least 72 hours in advance, but they received them just a day before. 
 
 They claimed that the budget was prepared in rush and hence distributed so late, which is why they didn't get the time to read the provisions and allocations carefully. They also complained that the   budget was given to them on the spot while it should have been handed over to them three days earlier. 
 
 Mayor   decided to postpone the budget meeting till February 12, so that the executive committee gets enough time to go through it. "This has never happened before. We should be given enough time beforehand to read the budget carefully. Since, we got copies just a day before, we didn't have the time to go through it." 
 
 The norms also state that while executive committee should get budget copies 72 hours before, the LMC House should get it 96 hours in advance. But most councillors got copies only a day before. 
 
  Bhatia said that since the budget will lay down financial provision for the city's development, it is better to give time to members. The meeting also had to select LMC vice-president but since   was unable to decide upon a candidate, the selection was also postponed till Monday.
 
 The budget has also recommended increase in the rent of LMC-owned community halls by 50%-100% and even 2-4 times in some cases.
