NEW DELHI: The son of a   in Haryana,   could have done many things in life. Become a farmer like his  , or joined the   like his  . 

 But it was the world of crime that seduced him. 
 
 Born in 1979, Satywan alias Sonu passed Class XII in 2000 from a school in his village, Dariyapur. He then joined college but dropped out as he got into bad company. He became friends with some local ruffians around the same time his brother, Anil alias Pehelwan, took to crime.
 
 Their father, Rajender, and mother were ill, but this had little impact on the brothers. “The twist in their lives came in 2005 when Sonu’s best friend Monu began to date his cousin, Rajrani,” said deputy commissioner of police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav. 
 
 “Sonu warned him several times to stay away from his sister, but Monu paid no heed,” Yadav added.
 
 The following year, the two got married, leaving Sonu furious. Interestingly, Rajrani’s parents came to terms with the marriage, but Sonu’s honour was hurt.
 
 He vowed to eliminate them both and formed a gang in 2006. He also added Dariyapur to his name. 
 
 In the next two years, he made two attempts to kill Monu but failed.
 
 Sonu was then arrested in 2007 in Rohini but got out on parole as his mother was unwell. After his mother passed away, Sonu jumped parole, never to be seen for a long time. 
 
 “Till 2007, he carried a reward of Rs 25,000 on his head. After the death of Sandeep alias Bhuri, a local gangster, Sonu became one of the top gangsters of his area and soon had a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head,” an officer recalled. 
 
 Of late, he had joined hands with Haryana gangster Rajesh Rajje and started an extortion racket targeting cable operators, bookies, toll plaza operators and businessmen. Those who didn’t give in to his demands paid with their lives.
