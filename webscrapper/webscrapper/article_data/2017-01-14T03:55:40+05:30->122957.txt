MUMBAI: The   on Friday said unless people develop a civic sense to keep their surroundings clean, campaigns against open defecation will never succeed.

 The observation, by a bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice  , came on a public interest litigation by advocate Vishwasrao Deokar. His petition said an amendment to the   and   and Panchayat Samiti Act 2010 has made it mandatory for candidates to produce a certificate from a local authority, showing the existence of toilets and its use. He urged the court to direct the government to consider complaints with photo proof or other evidence by rival parties or citizens to remove the names of people from the voters’ list and disqualify those contesting any elections if they do not have or don’t use toilets at home.
 
 “You want the government to verify if a candidate has a  ?” asked Justice Chellur. Deokar argued that though there is a statutory provision for non-compliance, there is no proper mechanism for taking action. Also, the solution suggested by him would be a proper one with no expenditure. “If it is allowed, there is no need for the government to spend a single paisa,” he added. The bench said the problem is not only of Maharashtra but of the whole country. Deokar then said the (central) government “is spending” on actor Amitabh Bachchan to create awareness about building toilets at home and to curb open defecation. “You need Amitabh Bachchan to say that?” asked Justice Chellur. She added, “Unless people develop civic sense that ‘I have to keep my surroundings clean,’ it will never happen.”
 
 In the order, the bench said they cannot direct the government by way of mandamus “except to look into concerns expressed by the petitioner and take a decision accordingly if the same is palatable or workable,” by treating the petition as a representation.
