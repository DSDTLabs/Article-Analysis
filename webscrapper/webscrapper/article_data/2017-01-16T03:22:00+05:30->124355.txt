Nagpur: Indian cricketer Umesh Yadav, who is from Nagpur, will be the city’s Swachhata brand ambassador. After a delay of over two years, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has announced a brand ambassador for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said Yadav gave his consent on Sunday and will help boost NMC’s campaign to make Nagpur a Swachh city. Yadav has assured to give time for NMC’s activities under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. It was mandatory for the NMC to appoint a brand ambassador but the move was delayed for reasons best known only to the administration. NMC also lost some marks for lack of brand ambassador in last two Swachh Survekshan. “It is great to be part of such a lovely campaign. I feel it is an opportunity for me to do something for my city,” said Yadav. “I am a proud Nagpurian. If I can motivate youngsters and other citizens to make our city clean, I will be more than happy. I feel this is something which should come from within,” he added.
