PANAJI: Minister for art and culture   urged  , especially women, to prioritise their health.

 “If the health of the woman or the head of the family is bad then the entire family suffers. Only if your health is good, is it possible to take care of patients,” he said, addressing nurses on the occasion of the International Nurses Day at   on Monday. A nurse that is happy and healthy can in turn keep patients happy, he said. 
 
 Wilson Fernandes, head of department of mental health nursing at the   at Bambolim and secretary of   (TNAI) that organized the programme said despite being an important contributor to healthcare delivery, nurses have a low social image. They lack leadership and don’t have the decision-making power required, he said. 
 
 To address the shortage of nurses in health services, health minister Vishwajit Rane said the government has filled 400 posts for nurses and will be employing 200 more. Those who have been working on contract basis for many years will be considered for the posts. The government is yet to address the lack of a nursing superintendent in the state.
