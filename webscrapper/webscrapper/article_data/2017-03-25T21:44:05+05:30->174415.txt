Superstar  's reported visit to   to launch a housing scheme is facing opposition from a group here. Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol   has urged 
  to drop his Sri Lanka visit to participate in an event organized by  's Gnanam Foundation. 

 Lyca has produced Rajinikanth's upcoming movie '2.0'. The actor was supposed to attend a two-day-long event in Jaffna, Sri Lanka to present 150 homes to displaced Tamils on April 9 and 10, according to a statement by Raju Mahalingam, Creative Head of Lyca Productions.
 
 "I have no personal agenda against Rajinikanth. We are good friends. But, I strongly oppose his decision to visit Sri Lanka and participate in an event organized by Lyca, which has business ties with the Sri Lankan government," Thirumavalavan claimed.
 
 "Artists should only entertain people. We, on behalf of our party 'Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi' request   not to earn Tamil people's hatred by participating in this event."
 
 Thirumavalavan said he has also sought an appointment to meet Rajinikanth to discuss the matter. "I have sought an appointment to meet Rajinikanth in person... I will hand over a memorandum and request him to drop his visit," he said.
