Jaipur: A 25-year-old liquor salesman was found murdered inside his rented room near   area of the city on Friday morning.

 The cops have identified the victim as one Shambhu Nath, a resident of Motihari in Bihar, who had been working as a salesman at a liquor shop in Khatipura area of the city. He had come to the city recently to support his family in Bihar.
 
 Vaishali Nagar police station house officer   informed TOI that Nath was attacked with a sharp weapon while he was sleeping. “The prima facie evidence suggests that somebody had attacked him with a weapon on chest and also at head,” added Bhatti.
 
 The police have also found deep injuries on Nath’s head, face and other parts which suggests that somebody had attacked him at multiple times with a weapon akin to a hammer, sickles or a stone.
 
 “He lived at a rented accommodation inside a house. There are several others rooms in the house too, we suspect that he was killed sometime late Thursday night but he was discovered only on Friday morning,” added a senior police official.
 
 The forensic teams, accompanied by dog squads searched for the clues inside the room. Cops and FSL teams collected some samples from his room and sent it for the examination.
 
 The Vaishali Nagar police station also interrogated the others tenants of the house to check if they had spotted some stranger wandering into the house. “It seems Nath was killed by somebody who knew him,” the official told TOI, adding that police have also informed the parents of Nath in Bihar.
 
 “His body has been kept at a mortuary, once the family arrives in the city, we will send the body for the post mortem examination,” said the official, adding that   footage of the area along with the call details record (CDR) of Shambhu Nath are being examined to determine his killer.
