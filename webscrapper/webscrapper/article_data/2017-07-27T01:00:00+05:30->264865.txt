We had told you recently that   had turned lyricist for the first time for the film,   Sang. The song that he had written, Ayyanaara Vandhutaanga Inga Paaru, which is more like an introduction number, has been crooned by  . We hear that the singer is all praise for the ace dancer’s lyrics. 

 Composer   tell us, “Shankar sir really liked the tune. When he learnt that Prabhudheva had written the lyrics, he was surprised. He even called him up to congratulate him. The song has come out so well.” This peppy folk number featuring Prabhudheva was shot in Kumbakonam and choreographed by Sridhar. 
 
 Talking about how he got the opportunity to work on the film, Ambarish says, “I was doing music for Motta Shiva Ketta Shiva. I had an opportunity to meet Prabhudheva once and he was really sweet to me. Much later, I heard that they were looking for music composers for this film. I didn’t know   sir was playing the lead. They had asked me to compose a song, which was later played it to him. It was then I realised I was working on his project. Since I have already worked with a dance master (Lawrence), I knew what kind of sound they like. We have composed two songs so far and I am looking forward to composing for the rest of the album.”
