 There will be one ‘thamarai sevagan’ for each of the 431 panchayats in Madurai district. It is a move to capitalise on the changing political dynamics of Tamil Nadu in an organised manner. They will start their work immediately.
 
 This ‘thamarai sevagan’ will be a native of the village and the party will take efforts to disseminate knowledge of the various schemes of the government including free LPG cylinder, free housing for poor, Selva Magal scheme for the girl child, accident insurance for Rs 1 per month and other innovative schemes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 These men would be armed with a special kit, which would contain a 100-page booklet on the various schemes in language. They will do away with intermediaries, who will come between the beneficiary and the scheme. 
 
  They will also have a booklet which will contain the phone numbers of the top officials of the district to make them more accessible to people. People can get to know about the scheme and also how to apply for the same through these volunteers.
