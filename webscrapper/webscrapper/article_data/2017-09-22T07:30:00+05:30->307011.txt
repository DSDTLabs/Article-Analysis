Chandigarh: At 23, when most students are figuring out which subject to major in, a Panjab University student has already turned an innovator, technologist and entrepreneur. Meet Shivanshi Vashist, who has already two patents in her kitty, was successful in filing her third   for her innovation of “hyper-thermo incubator shaker with air and vacuum control,” the product which was launched in the university on Thursday. 

 The product launched by Vashist would help micro-organisms grow at higher temperatures. The high- value commercials used in the pharmaceutical industry cannot be produced unless there are enzymes made from micro-organisms cultivated at this high temperature. So, this product will help create the enzymes used in the high-value commercials.
 
 Dr Rohit Sharma, chief coordinator, Cluster Innovation Centre in Biotechnology, Panjab University, explained that these micro-organisms are used to produce enzymes like nitrilase, which are further used in pharmaceuticals, textiles, paints. 
 
 Anil Koul, director, Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh, said that innovators today should have the burning desire to innovate.
