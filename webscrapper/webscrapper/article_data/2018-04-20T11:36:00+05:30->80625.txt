CHANDIGARH: Floor-wise sale of properties was discussed in the   held on Thursday. The committee members, who were against allowing floor-wise sale of the residential properties, argued that the floor-wise sale will aggravate the parking problem.

The problem is grave in sectors 31 to 47, which have the highest number of registered vehicles (1.46 lakh). The city has the highest per capita vehicle density in the country. A petition seeking directions for restraining the UT administration from permitting residential plots to be converted into apartments is pending in  .
 
 In the draft of the master plan for 2031, the administration had proposed to re-introduce the Chandigarh Apartment Rules that allow subdivision of residential plots of 1,000 square yards and above into two dwelling units on each floor. The residential buildings over smaller plots were proposed to be subdivided into separate dwelling units with not more than one unit on each floor. However, the proposal was dropped after receiving objections from residents. The shortage of housing stock in Chandigarh has made its property least affordable in the Tricity, which includes Panchkula and Mohali. The   allows bifurcation of the big plots, which interests the owners of many kanal houses in sectors 1 to 15.
 
 The committee also discussed the issue of sale of heritage furniture belonging to city in different auction houses in foreign countries. Since 2007, a large number of furniture items designed by   and Le Corbusier, has been auctioned in France, US and  .
