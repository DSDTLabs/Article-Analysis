Trichy: A five-member gang robbed Rs 6 lakh in cash and 10 sovereigns of   jewellery from a Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank branch at Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district on Monday afternoon. According to police, the gang members, wearing gloves -- two carrying guns and others carrying weapons -- entered the branch around 3pm while many staff members went out for lunch. Branch manager Govindarajan, cashier Thyagarajan and another staff Koteeswaran were still there.

 One of the gang members entered the manager’s room and threatened him at gunpoint asking for the locker key. Even though the manager handed them the key, they were unable to open it. When the manager tried to say something, one of the robbers allegedly fired on the floor. The gang then threatened the cashier and staff to open the locker. They were dragged to the locker and forced to open it. 
 
 Once it was opened, the robbers took 10 sovereigns of gold jewellery from the vault and 6 lakh in cash from the cashier’s cabin and fled the scene.
 
 While escaping from the bank after the robbery, they carried a digital video recorder (DVR), connected to CCTV cameras in the bank, with them.
 
 On information, Tiruvarur DSP Asokan and inspector Manivel rushed to the spot and conducted an inquiry. Thanjavur range DIG Loganathan and Tiruvarur SP N M Mylvahanan also visited the bank and conducted an inquiry with the bank manager and others.
 
 Mylvahanan told reporters that four out of five gang members had entered the branch while the fifth one had remained outside the bank to ensure that their plan went as planned.
 
 “No one was wearing masks. However, all of them had gloves. We will soon catch the robbers,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, four special teams have been formed by the SP to nab the accused.
