CHANDIGARH: The   has directed a hospitality company to pay Rs 34,700 and Rs 7000 towards compensation and litigation expenses to a Sector 29 resident for failing to provide a gift voucher for five nights and six days holiday package for Goa within a week.

 
  
 
 Sumeet   alleged he had purchased a holidays package of Rs 3.92 lakh from Mahindra Holidays and Resorts India Limited after paying a membership fee of Rs 34,700 on April 29, 2017. He said the company had not provided the   voucher worth Rs 5,000 and gift voucher from the date of making down payment of Rs 34,700 and even the membership kit was delivered late on June 1, 2017.
 
 It was submitted that as the firm failed to provide due service to the complainant at the initial stage, the complainant requested them for cancellation of his membership and sought refund of the amount paid. However, the firm did not pay any heed to the request.
 
 The company said all offers and promises were duly fulfilled as per the eligibility of the complainant. It was stated that the down payment discount of Rs 4,500 had already been adjusted and resort credit vouchers worth Rs 3,000 sent to the complainant along with a membership kit on May 26, 2017. It was also stated that other three benefits of three EMI discounts worth Rs 4500, five-night holiday at Club Mahindra Resort and one week international holiday could not be released due to cancellation request raised by the complainant on May 26, 2017.
 
 It was submitted that the complainant decided to cancel the membership due to personal reasons and he had no grievances against the company. It was also submitted that in the instant matter against the membership cost of Rs 3.92 lakh, 60% of membership fee was Rs 2.35lakh, which was non-refundable; 40% of membership fee was Rs 1.56 lakh, which was refundable after applicable deduction in terms of membership rules. The company said the complainant had paid only Rs 34,700 as down payment, which was just 10% of membership cost, as a result nothing was left to be refunded, hence the entire money paid by the complainant stood forfeited in terms of membership rules.
 
 The forum, after hearing both the sides, said the company failed to materialise its commitments made at the time of giving membership till the passage of nearly a month, which forced the complainant to sought for the cancellation of his membership as well as refund of the amount paid.
