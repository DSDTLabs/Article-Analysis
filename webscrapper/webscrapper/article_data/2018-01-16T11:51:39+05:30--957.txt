PANCHKULA:   on Monday threatened to go on a massive strike across the state if the case against   state president   Buddhiraja and others is not withdrawn. As a mark of solidarity, Congress party workers met Buddhiraja who was booked by the Panchkula police for posing a question to Haryana CM,   in Panchkula. Wife of former   MLA, Anjali D K Bansal, said, “If asking questions is wrong, then why did the CM organise such a programme? I request the Haryana CM to not play with the future of youngsters after booking them under serious charges. If the government does not withdraw the case, we will launch a state-wide protest.” 

 According to Mahila Congress state president, Ranjeeta Mehta, it was shameful that the Haryana government was taking such actions against a youth for seeking an answer from the CM in a “Connect to CM programme.”
 
 “The government has imposed non-bailable offences against the NSUI State President Divyanshu Buddhiraja and his party supporter Hardik Nain, Pratap Rana and others which is wrong,” said, Mehta.
 
 Mother of Nain, Sunil Kumari, a housewife said, “My son has done nothing wrong by asking a question to a CM. He should have answered his question and not punish him like this.”
 
 The court granted bail to both Divyanshu and Nain today after opposition raised their voice. Both the persons were booked by the cops under section 147 (punishment for rioting), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC in sector-5 police station and were arrested by the cops soon after the event end in government college, Sector 1.
