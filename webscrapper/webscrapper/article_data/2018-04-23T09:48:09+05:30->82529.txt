MUMBAI:   (Kurla) and   (Bandra), along with two rest-of-Mumbai elevens will now get to watch   play their home matches at the Wankhede Stadium this Indian Premier League (IPL) season.

 
 Al Barkaat defeated Swami Vivekanand (Borivali) in the final of the Harris Sheild tournament while Rizvi defeated Don Bosco (Matunga) to win the Giles Shield this season.
 
 Former   (MCA) managing committee member and well-acknowledged pitch curator Nadim Memon had written to the Committee of Administrators (CoA) requesting that young cricketers representing schools and winning championships be allowed entry into the stadium to watch matches as a result of their achievements.
 
 The CoA, in turn, requested the franchise to do the same which has been green-flagged. Close to 18 youngsters from each team, as a result, will be part of the crowd cheering for MI when it takes on Sunrisers Hyderabad fourth home game on Tuesday.
