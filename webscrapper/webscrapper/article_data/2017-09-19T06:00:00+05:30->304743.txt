Meanwhile, it has been reliably learnt that Bollywood writer   of  ,   and Dishoom fame has been roped in to pen the Hindi version of the film. Considering that Tollywood movies are all about punch dialogues, the makers didn’t want the impact of the lines to be lost in translation, and put Dalal on the job. 
 
 “The powerful dialogues of Prabhas in Bahubali struck a chord with the Hindi audience as well. Therefore, the makers of Saaho were especially keen on not losing out on the Hindi nativity. They wanted the dialogues to be written by a Bollywood writer who could do complete justice to them and convey the emotions perfectly. That’s why they brought a pro like Dalal on board and are also happy with how he has tweaked it for the Hindi audience,” said the source. 
 Saaho is being helmed by Sujeeth, who made his directorial debut with the 2014 Tollywood hit, Run Raja Run.
