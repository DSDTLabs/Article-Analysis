NEW DELHI:   president  , who's serving sentences in fodder scam cases, was today granted a five-day parole to attend the wedding of his elder son later this week. his lawyer and one of his close aides said today.

 Lalu, who has been convicted in three fodder scam cases by a special CBI court in Ranchi since December last year, is ailing and currently undergoing treatment at   hospital in the   capital. He will be flown to Patna this evening.
 
 His son  , a sitting lawmaker and former state minister, will be tying the knot with Aishwarya Rai, daughter of party legislator Chandrika Rai, on May 12 in Patna.
 
 The parole plea was made after Lalu's hearing on provisional bail application could not take place last Friday due to advocates' agitation in the Jharkhand high court. Lalu is in judicial custody after his conviction in three fodder scam cases related to fraudulent withdrawals from the Dumka, Deoghar and Chaibasa treasuries.
 
 The former Bihar chief minister was imprisoned in Birsa Munda central jail, where he developed several health related complications and was shifted to Rims in Ranchi. Lalu also underwent treatment at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, from where he was referred back to Rims on May 1. Lalu could not attend Tej Pratap's engagement ceremony in Patna on April 18.
