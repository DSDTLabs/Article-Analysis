HOWRAH: Traffic on   in   was thrown completely out of gear for almost three hours during the morning rush hour on Friday after a CTC bus overturned and a lorry turned on it atop Santragachi bridge, injuring 11people.

 It was around 9am when the right wheel of the packed Amta-bound CTC bus from Esplanade came off in the middle of the bridge and the vehicle turned on one side, its front jutting onto the Kolkata-bound flank. The driver of a truck, travelling from the opposite direction, stepped on the brake to avoid the bus, but hit the divider. In the impact, the heavy goods vehicle also turned on one side, landing on the bus.
 
 While police and residents took the injured—10 bus passengers and the truck driver-—to Howrah hospital, the bus and truck blocked two middle lanes— one leading to Kolkata and the other NH-6— till about noon. With repair work on on the third lane, vehicles on both directions were forced to snake their way through the only open Kolkata-bound flank. This caused a massive jam. Around 11am, a crane arrived to haul the bus and the truck away. Normal traffic could be restored only around noon.
 
 Bus passenger  , who fractured his arm, said, “As the bus swerved to the right, the driver struggled to pull it to the left. Soon, the bus overturned and moments later, we were hit by a lorry.”
 
  traffic of Howrah City Police Ashok   said, “Fortunately, there were no casualty.”
