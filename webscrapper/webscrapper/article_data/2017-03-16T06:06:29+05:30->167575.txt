NOIDA: The   will roll out   in the entire state from April 1. Currently, the system is functional in 24 districts, including  , Ghaziabad and Lucknow.

 “We got a good response about   from these districts. So we have decided to roll out the system in the entire state from April 1. The transport department will issue manual challans and e-challans till April 15. After that, manual challans will be stopped completely and the department will switch to e-challan,” transport commissioner K Ravindra Naik told TOI.
 
 The move will bring efficiency and transparency to the department’s functioning, he said. The   issues challans to vehicle owners for different violations. The e-challan system, which was launched last year, works through a mobile application. A mobile phone/tablet having the app is connected to a bluetooth printer.
 
 Traffic officers feed the violator’s driving licence number or vehicle registration number into the app, which then flashes the vehicle owner’s details. The officer then issues a challan and on payment, a receipt is printed on the spot. 
 
 In case the violator is not carrying cash, he or she can pay the fine by using a debit card. Otherwise, he/she will be given a printed copy of the challan, which can later be paid at the ARTO office or in court.
 
 The system reduces hardware dependency and facilitates enforcement process. The mobile app also creates an online database of violators, which can be analysed and used for future enforcement.
 
 The mobile app for e-challan has been developed by NIC Delhi under the initiative of the Union ministry of road transport and highways.
