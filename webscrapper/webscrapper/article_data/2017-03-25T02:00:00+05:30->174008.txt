PATNA: Patna’s  , fulcrum of Bihar’s political history, will witness a carnival of fitness and fun activities with the launch of  , an initiative of The Times of India, on the streets around the historic ground this Sunday. 

 For three hours after the sunrise, the two-way road from the JP roundabout to Bari Path Mor will be out of bounds to vehicles and become Happy Streets for Patnaites to skate, jog, cycle, do meditation, play soccer or just stroll around with their loved ones. 
 
 The event drew massive crowds in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata, among other cities. After Kolkata, Patna is the second city in eastern India where Happy Streets is happening.
 
 Cycling enthusiasts don’t need to bring their bicycles. Bring instead a copy of The Times of India of Saturday, February 25, show it to the organisers and they will rent you a bicycle for free. You have to return the bicycle after the event, obviously!
 
 The   and   have partnered with The Times of India to organise Happy Streets, which is inspired by Ciclovia in Columbia’s Bogota. It’s designed to encourage people to use non-motorised transport and prod the state to create support infrastructure. It aims to create a relaxed atmosphere to help residents -- men and women alike of all age groups -- unwind themselves. It is also aimed at raising awareness about healthy living and improving community interaction.
 
 “It’s a first-of-its-kind initiative for Patna. A fabulous citizen-connect initiative, Happy Streets will bring residents closer to one another and the administration. It is in fact in sync with the development initiatives made by the government to promote healthy lifestyle while indulging in fun activities,” Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor said on Friday.
 
 Patna SP (traffic) SP Prantosh Kumar Das sees it as a welcome move to promote non-motorised transport among citizens, which will not only help reduce the abnormal vehicular load on Patna streets but also help check air pollution.
 
 Residents are equally enthusiastic. “I will be doing skateboarding in the Happy Streets,” wrote entreprenur Amit Kumar on Facebook. Akansha and Madhuri Parmar, who reside in a girls’ hostel on Boring Road, have planned to “have a gala time” in the Happy Streets along with “almost all our hostel mates” while Shagun Shankar of Boring Canal Road said she and her friends were “just waiting for the day to break on Sunday when we will play soccer right on the road for the first time in life”.
