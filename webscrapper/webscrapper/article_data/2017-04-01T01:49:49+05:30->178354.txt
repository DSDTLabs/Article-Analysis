Lucknow: A number of candidates aspiring for admission to   created chaos outside office of the chief medical officer along with their guardians, on Friday evening. Amidst angry sloganeering, aspirants claimed their age in the medico-legal examination was increased against their documented chronological age. Authorities, however, claimed the medico-legal examination conducted was fair and based on X-ray of bones which reveal true age.

 Since morning the   office was full of aspiring students who were first tested by a team of four   at Balrampur hospital for their age certification and then to get report through the CMO. By evening, however, a group of stdudents and their guardians alleged conspiracy and foul play that lead to dispute over age. 
 
 “The claims of the candidates are baseless as their age is determined by a team of four doctors, including a surgeon and after that there is no chance of the finding being wrong, so we cannot just write any age the candidate claims if tests done say otherwise,” said Dr G S Bajpai, CMO, Lucknow.
