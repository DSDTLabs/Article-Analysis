When actress   went on a holiday to USA recently, she experienced love at first sight. No, not with a person, but a sensual, energetic style of dance called  . Explaining more about the dance, Ekta says, “Zouk is a versatile partner dance that has its roots in Brazil and can be performed to a variety of music and moods. It is characterised by wave-like movements and striking hair movements by the lady. When you observe it for the first time, it looks very easy to master. Only when you start practising it, do you realise how complex it actually is. Its fluid patterns and movements make it look easy, but in reality, it’s not.’

 Zouk was a happy accident that happened on what was otherwise supposed to be a tourist-y trip. “I went on an unplanned trip to New York for a month, to explore the city and also spend some time with a good friend. There, I went to a club that was hosting a dancing social oraganised by the Zouk community. As someone who’s always up to try new, novel things, Zouk interested me and I took it up. I first signed up for level one course, but since I was there only for a month, I signed up for level two as well, practising them back to back,” says Ekta.
 
 Given that the   travelled all the way to New York to meet a close friend and ended up learning a partner dance form, is there something interesting happening on the romantic front? “No, not at all,” she claims, adding, “My entire focus now is on my career. In fact, I’m learning all these arts hoping it will help me hone my skills on screen. Relationships are fun but they can be distracting as well.”
