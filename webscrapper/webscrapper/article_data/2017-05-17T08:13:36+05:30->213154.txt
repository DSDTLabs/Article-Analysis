 Members of the Hyderabad Schools Parents' Association (HSPA) lashed out at the committee and the Telangana government over its delay in regulating school fee across the state. "It is unfortunate that there is further delay in submission of the report. It all reeks of an attempt to delay the report and subsequent action on fee regulation. Delay helps the schools to continue with their loot for more time," read a press statement issued by the association. The association further demanded that if the government is serious about helping parents then it should immediately stay the fee hike for the next academic year which is set to begin from June 12. 
 
 To exert more pressure on the state government, the HSPA has decided to intensify its stir and launch a massive sticker campaign. In the sticker campaign, supporters will stick a big note on their vehicles with the slogan 'CM sir please regulate the school fees'. The campaign is expected to be launched by the end of the month.
