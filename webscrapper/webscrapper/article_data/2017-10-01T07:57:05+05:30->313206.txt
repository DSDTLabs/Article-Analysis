A day before  , before his climactic battle with Ram,   decided to go out on the streets of Gurgaon and quite surprisingly, he had his arch-nemesis' brother Lakshman along with him! The duo had a mission- teaching Gurgaon's residents lessons of safe driving. In an innovative awareness drive carried out by the Gurgaon Police and Road Safety Officers from the city, actors and cops dressed as the two characters spoke to motorists at HUDA City Centre and Golf Course Road, educating them about safe driving practices.

  Ravan had a simple message for all those driving without a helmet or seat belt: "Mere toh dus sar hain, ek kat bhi gaya toh kya hoga? Par aapka toh ek hi hai. Isko kyun risk kar rahe ho?" Lakshman talked about the importance of zebra crossing and how motorists should respect pedestrians' rights. "This zebra crossing is your Lakshman rekha. On a red light, you should never cross it. Stop behind it at all times," he told the drivers. The two also counselled commuters against making illegal turns, jumping the red light, and other traffic offences. Road Safety Officer Rajkumar, who was conducting the drive, said, "Since it's Dussehra, we thought it would be apt to have characters from the Ramayan speak about road safety to the commuters instead of just cops."

  At night, Yamraj patrolled MG Road near the malls, but the God of Death did not have a sinister motive. He was out there to caution people against the hazards of drunk driving and to urge them to follow traffic rules. Constable Sandeep Singh, who was playing Yamraj, said, "I am wearing this necklace of skulls and all I tell these drunk drivers is that you could be next if you continue this."
 
  
  
 
  The drive was successful - not only did the cops, aided by Yamraj, stop and counsel errant drivers, they also issued over 40 challans for drunk drivers.
