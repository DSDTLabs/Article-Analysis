Ghaziabad: Two men in their late 20s, who had allegedly tried to extort Rs 20 lakh from a Sahibabad-based doctor by posing as henchmen of gangster Neeraj Bawana, were arrested on Tuesday.

 The men had opened fire at the house of the doctor, Udaiveer Singh (59), on the intervening night of January 7-8. Two FIRs were registered in the matter at Sahibabad police station. The first FIR was registered on January 8 under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC, a day after the men fired three rounds at Singh’s house in Kailash Park. Around 1am on January 8, Singh heard repeated knocks upon the gate of his house and came to the first-floor of his balcony. Two masked men who were waiting at the gate fired three rounds upon Singh, which missed him by inches. They fled from the spot but the entire incident was captured in a CCTV camera installed near the main gate.
 
 A second FIR was lodged on January 10, after the men made two   calls on Singh’s mobile number.
