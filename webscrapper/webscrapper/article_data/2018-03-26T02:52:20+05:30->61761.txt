NEW DELHI:   proceedings on Monday are likely to be action-packed as the 20   join their colleagues after a two-month hiatus. Critical issues facing the city are likely to be taken up.

 Delhi high court had on Friday restored membership of its 20   MLAs and referred the case back to the  . Though AAP continued to enjoy a comfortable majority even when its 20 MLAs were disqualified, the party was targeted by opposition on one occasion during the current budget session as the minimum number of legislators were not present in the  .
 
 As per law, at least a third of the total House strength must be met to allow it to function. Some MLAs were reportedly sitting outside the House even though the session was on. Expressing his displeasure, Speaker Ram Niwas Goel had advised them to be present in the assembly.
 
 AAP’s voice is likely to be stronger in the assembly now as many among the 20 MLAs have been vocal on key issues. These legislators have claimed that during the time they were barred, the development work in their constituencies had suffered. 
 
 With chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asking them to speed up work in their areas, the MLAs are likely to flag key issues in the assembly.
 
 The opposition, too, appeared ready for the challenge. Targeting the government on education, leader of opposition Vijender Gupta claimed that the government was putting extra pressure on students. “Students of IX and XI classes of 1,500 unaided schools are being detained, putting extra pressure on young minds. The objective is to show 100% results in board examinations. In the process, students get an inferiority complex. I will raise the issue in the assembly on Monday,” Gupta said.
