KURUKSHETRA: Fear pervades   in Shahabad sub-division of Kurukshetra these days. The spotting of dismembered human bodies, decapitated heads and severed limbs over the last 15 days has spooked the residents.

 On January 5, the mutilated body of a 12-year-old boy was found in   canal. It had one forearm and part of the torso missing. On January 12, someone spotted a decapitated head minus the eyes and ears in the village.On Sunday , a forearm with “Ramesh“ tattooed on it was found in sugarcane fields.
 
 Vikram Kumar, in whose fields the forearm was found, said, “We fear it could be an act of human sacrifice or black magic. We are making announcements from the village temple and gurdwara asking people not to panic and take turns to keep a vigil at night.   (SHO)   said there were a lot of sugarcane fields in the area and they were searching these along with the villagers to find clues on how the body parts appeared in the village. “I cannot comment right now. We are also using dog squads to aid our search.“
 
 Police have set up a permanent police control room on the road to Barara, near the village, to keep a tab on movement of any suspicious vehicles or people.
