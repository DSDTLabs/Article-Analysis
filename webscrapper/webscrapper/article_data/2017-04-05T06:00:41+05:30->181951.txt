AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s first woman police chief Geetha Johri is an ace   player who wields the gun and the racquet with equal passion. The 59-year-old top cop has been playing badminton for nearly seven years. She recently won the bronze medal in women’s doubles 55+ category, partnering Ahmedabad’s Taramati Parmar at the 41st Masters (veteran) National Badminton Championships in Kochi. Johri and Taramati will now represent India at the World Senior Badminton Championship 2017, to be held in Kochi later this year.

  “Geethaben is extremely passionate about badminton and regularly makes time for it,” Taramati told TOI. “I feel very proud that she has been appointed the in-charge DGP.” She said she and Johri play well as a team and she hopes to start practising for the finals soon. “We have not been able to practise regularly but I hope to do so to win the world championship,” Taramati said.
