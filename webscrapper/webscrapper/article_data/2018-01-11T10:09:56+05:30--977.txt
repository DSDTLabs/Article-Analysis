HYDERABAD: The TRS government is all set to make every sop doling event a mega publicity affair so that the electorate is made aware that it is indeed the pink party that is delivering the goods for them. 

 With this in mind, the government has decided to distribute 4,000 per acre crop capital in the form of bankers cheques. This, despite the fact that the amount can be transferred electronically to farmers' accounts, which would be cheaper. The cheque distribution programme in each   constituency is to be held with much fanfare involving ministers, MPs, MLAs and party cadre. 
 
 The cabinet sub-committee which met here on Wednesday decided to submit its recommendation based on a survey by the agriculture department to the chief minister on Thursday. Though three options got almost similar responses, the committee decided to go with bankers cheques. The survey was conducted in 551 mandals and 664 villages on Tuesday in which 62,677 farmers were asked to spell their choice of payment for crop capital.
 
 While 31.58% favoured payment through bankers cheques, 27.55% opted for electronic transfer to bank accounts and 26.59% voted for cash. "There are 71.75 lakh farmers as per the records and over one crore acres of land are under cultivation. We have not imposed any restriction on the total land holding to become eligible to receive the benefit," agriculture minister P Srinivasa Reddy told TOI. 
 
 Nearly 92.7% farmers have less than 10 acres in the state while only 0.28% farmers have more than 20 acres. The distribution of cheques will start tentatively from May 15 at a grand meeting addressed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who wants to promote   as the most farmer-friendly state in the country. 
 
 Meanwhile, the finance department made a request to Reserve Bank of India to give instructions to all banks to be ready with required cash and not trouble farmers citing lack of cash in the banks.
