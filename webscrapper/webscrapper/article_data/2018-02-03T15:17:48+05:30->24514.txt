Mysuru: Door frame   (DFMD) installed at   railway station serve as mere ornaments, and expose passengers to risk.

 Though there is a threat from terrorists, the DFMDs at Mysuru City railway station are not switched on. The authorities have installed three door frame metal detectors, two at the main entrance and one at the back entrance. 
 
 The DFMDs installed at the railway station are not functioning. The DFMD can detect both ferrous and non-ferrous metals concealed on a person in any conceivable manner. On an average, more than 30,000 people travel from the railway station, and more than 30 trains are operated from the railway station daily. All the three DFMDs which are installed at the railway station are not switched on or not functioning, which can give ample space to those with nefarious intentions, to carry out their acts at the railway station.
 
 Though the railway minister and officials speak more about the safety of passengers, the ground reality is that the safety of passengers is compromised at the railway station. During Dasara, when there is a movement of VVIPs, both the DFMDs at the main entrance are found to be working, but they are later turned off.
 
 After this was brought to the notice of railway authorities, they   to the concerned inspector, to know the reason for the DFMDs not working round-the-clock.
