 After her whirlwind tours across the world post her crowning, Manushi was glad to be at Bennett University. She said, "I am really happy to visit Bennett University and I feel really nostalgic about my college, as it has been a while since I have been there. I really like the fact that this campus is not located in the heart of the city, it is a beautiful campus with a lot of open space."
 
  
  
 
 
  "There isn’t too much distraction for students, but at the same time, the campus is well-equipped in every sense. This is very much like the college I go to. This is really nostalgic for me," said Manushi as she took a round of the campus with the faculty. "When I visited the lecture halls, the faculty told me that they are fully-equipped with Wi-Fi. That is something my medical college also has, though we are not allowed to use mobile phones inside the college," she added.

 When the students assembled in the university’s lawn for an interactive session with Manushi, the most common question was how she took out time from her medical studies to prepare for beauty pageants. "I don't know why people think it is surprising for an aspiring doctor to become Miss World. We are normal people who study science. We are not zombies, and it is any like other stream. Miss World does not need any educational qualification, thankfully. I am not a graduate yet, and doing this is not taking me away from academics. It is just about following your dreams. If you want to do something good, Miss World gives you that opportunity," she said.

  Manushi stressed that you should not be bothered about what is going to happen next. "I think it's okay not knowing what you want to become. When I entered medical college, I wasn't pressurized mentally that I have to crack this. I just enjoyed studying and thankfully, I cleared the entrance exam in the first attempt and got a good college. As students, it's important that irrespective of whatever you are doing, you educate yourself, as that gives you certain standing in public. Always realise your worth, you have a place in this world which no one else can take. It’s important to love what you are doing than to plan everything," she said.

 Manushi told the students that once she realized that she wanted to be the Miss World, she worked hard to make her way into a world that was completely unknown to her. "When I was at the Miss India competition, I was just trying to learn. It was all very new for me, and I was wondering where do I fit in. But it is about enjoying the whole journey. I knew I was doing something I love to do and that's what happened at Miss World, life is very uncertain and you have to enjoy it. As a kid, I remember watching 'Devdas' and my mom, who is really fond of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, would say, 'Maanu, one day, I see you over there'. Maybe, that is where it all started. I started looking up to those people, I started thinking about it. At the Miss India competition, I didn’t think I was going to win, I didn’t know how to wear makeup, I did not have the most glamorous clothes. I was like a nerd who was put among glamorous, beautiful and talented girls, and I didn’t know what I was doing," said Manushi.

  After some serious conversation it was time for some fun, as Manushi was asked to translate some Haryanvi lyrics. Later, when Manushi was asked about her Bollywood plans, something that she has been asked often after winning the Miss World title, she replied, "I am a person who believes in uncertainty in life. I don’t think I have to tell people right now whether I am definitely going to be a cardiac surgeon or would land in Bollywood. Why can't I do both? why can't I do everything that I want to do in life?"
