Panaji: The state government is trying its best to protect 3,200-odd liquor licences that have come under the ambit of the   order, but   feel that the implementation of the apex court order would help reduce accidents along highways.

 Replying to mediapersons’ queries at a press conference on Monday, deputy inspector general of police (DIG)  , said that the implementation of the order would be a deterrent to drunken driving and to cut down accidents.
 
 Kumar, however, pointed out that highways in Goa are not wide enough and if liquor outlets are pushed 500m back as directed by the Supreme Court guidelines, “it might be a deterrent for drivers to get down and walk some distance.”
 
 As per data of the traffic cell since January till date, 70 persons have died in road accidents, as against 69 deaths in   for a corresponding period last year.
 
 The state government has assured the alcohol trade that it will find a way to protect them. As identified by the excise department, 3,200 licences are operating within either 500m of a national or state highway.
