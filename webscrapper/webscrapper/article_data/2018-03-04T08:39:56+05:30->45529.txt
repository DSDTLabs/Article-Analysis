CHENNAI: Nearly a year after the   ( ) announced that four idols in its collection were reported as stolen from Tamil Nadu, the Archaeological Survey of India ( ) has written to the Canberra-based museum regarding the artefacts. 

 
  
  
 
 The ASI’s missive is in response to a letter from the NGA seeking additional details on the idols before they could be returned.
 
 ASI officials said information furnished by the Tamil Nadu police was included in the letter. “We received a communication from the idol wing of the Tamil Nadu police providing further details on the idols. This has been incorporated into our response to the NGA,” an ASI official told TOI. 
 
 In April 2017, the NGA had confirmed that four sculptures in its collection were reported as stolen by the idol wing of the Tamil Nadu police. 
 
 These included a 1000-year-old Nandi statue, a bronze idol of Saint Sambandar from the 12th century and a Bhadrakali idol with trident from the 11th century, all dating to the Chola era, as well as a pair of door guardians (dvarapala) dating to the Vijayanagar dynasty. 
 
 As per NGA records, three idols were sourced from Art of the Past gallery in New York, associated with notorious art dealer Subhash Kapoor. 
 
 The museum dispatched a letter to ASI in June last year seeking more details on the idols. 
 
 ASI officials said the museum required additional information to pursue the case with the Australian government. 
 
 “The museum has spent a lot of money to purchase the idols. So, establishing where they were stolen from is vital for the NGA to return them,” the official said. 
 
 Two years ago, Australia had returned three artefacts, including an idol of goddess Pratyangira, stolen from a Shiva temple in Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 In 2014, then Australian Prime Minister   had returned two statues of Nataraja and Ardhanariswarar stolen from temples in the state.
