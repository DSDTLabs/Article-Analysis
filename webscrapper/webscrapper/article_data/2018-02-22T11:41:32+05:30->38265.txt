MADURAI: While the state government’s   two-wheeler scheme is all set to be launched on February 24, a public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Madurai bench of the Madras high   to stop its implementation. 

 B Ramkumar Adityan from   has filed the petition. It is expected that it would come up for hearing on Thursday. 
 
 The petitioner has sought a direction to the government not to implement any new scheme including the two-wheeler scheme till it brings its fiscal deficit to zero. 
 
 No public purpose is served in the subsidy scheme (Amma two-wheeler scheme). According to it, 50% of the cost of the two-wheeler or Rs, 25,000 whichever is less would be provided to the beneficiary and one lakh vehicles would be provided this year. To receive it, 3.36 lakh women have submitted applications, of which 1.82 have got learners licence newly. 
 
 Under this scheme, there was no provision to check whether the beneficiary has owned two-wheeler already. There are chances for ineligible people to get benefit under the scheme. The previous DMK government spent Rs 3,942 crore for its freebies’ schemes of distribution of colour television and gas stoves from 2006-11. The present AIADMK government spent Rs 1.2 lakh crore for its freebies like grinders, mixies, table fans, laptops, cycles, saris and dhotis from 2011 to 2016.
