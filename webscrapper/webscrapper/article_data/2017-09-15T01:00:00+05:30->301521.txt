 As we reached   to look for the freshest fuchchas on campus, we found a bunch of first-year students all set for the OPPO Delhi   2017 competition. More than 70 girls had registered, and singers Kamal Khan and   were the celebrity judges at the college. 

 
 
  
  WINNER: Noyonika Sircar
 
 
  
 As we began with our first round, emcee Yash Khatri played the perfect entertainer with his light-hearted jokes while DJ Sumit Sethi kept the students entertained with his spot on background music. The judges not only sang their latest tracks but also shook a leg with the contestants. "It was really nice to be here, we really had lot of fun," said Kuwar. Kamal added, "We wish all the best to all the contestants and it was great to perform at the college."
