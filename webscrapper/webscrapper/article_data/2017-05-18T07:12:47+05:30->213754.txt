CHANDIGARH: Ahead of   Amit Shah’s visit to Haryana in July, party MLAs and chairpersons of various corporations on Wednesday decided to carry out the party’s ‘Jan Sampark Abhiyan’ (mass contact programme) at the booth level from May 26 to June 10.

 In a meeting lasting around two hours on Wednesday afternoon at Haryana Niwas, it was decided that BJP legislators would dedicate 15 days to booths to make people aware of the government’s achievements, said state BJP president Subhash Barala. The meeting also discussed activities to celebrate the birth centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.
 
 Chief minister   and Haryana BJP general secretary Suresh Bhatt also attended the meeting. Barala informed celebration of Environment Day on June 5 as ‘Swachhta Divas’ in Haryana and the three day scheduled visit of Shah from July 4 to July 6 were also discussed. Barala said on the occasion, a cleanliness campaign would be held in 120 big villages, towns and cities across Haryana. There were speculations that around 16 dissident BJP MLAs could air their grievances in the meeting. One of them Gurugram MLA Umesh Aggarwal said, “We have earlier put forth our issues on an appropriate platform and there has been improvement. If required we will approach the authorities.”
 
 As part of the countrywide Vistar Yatra (expansion programme), Shah’s visit to the state is important. The main purpose of the Yatra is to strengthen the BJP cadre with an eye on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and reach out to electorates at the booth level.
