LUCKNOW: After vegetables, it's the fruit prices that have gone up by 50% across the city in the past week due to heavy rains in other parts of the country. Wholesale dealers say the hike is most likely to continue in the coming days. 

 Besides the weather, wholesalers say a drop in the supply from other parts of the country, mainly due to transportation problems, has contributed to the hike. Many vehicles are not being put to use because transportation   have still not revised their rates under GST.
 
 Meanwhile, the public continues to suffer because of the hike.  , a homemaker who lives in  , said, "I fast during   so I eat cereal once a day. The rest of the day, I have to rely on fruits. For a week now, I have been buying only papaya and bananas as they are the cheapest." 
 
  Kumar, another homemaker from  , said she goes to a wholesale market for fruits. "I save Rs 250-300 there because even exotic fruits are available at comparatively cheaper rates," she said.
