NEW DELHI: With Punjab assembly elections just days away, a   on the  , named “The Wall of Truth”, was inaugurated on the premises of Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib on Sunday. Hundreds of people who lost their husbands, fathers or brothers were present during an emotionally charged function.

 No political leaders made it to the event, probably because the code of conduct was in place before the Punjab polls. However, there were clear political undertones. While those from BJP and SAD were invited,   functionaries were ignored. Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal and deputy CM Sukhbir Badal, who were expected to inaugurate the memorial, were missing.
 
 Two separate entrances opposite Parliament lead to the 3,000-sqft memorial, constructed at a cost of Rs 2.45 crore. Angular marble walls merge and rise in a zigzag manner, symbolic of the stuffy lanes in which thousands of Sikhs were slaughtered, said Manjit Singh GK, president, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which also goes to polls soon.
 
 “The memorial teaches the value of peace,” said Jasdeep Kaur, whose father was lynched by a rampaging mob.
 
 The structure has names of thousands of Sikhs killed in the riots — as well as those who died trying to save them — etched on its walls. On a raised platform is a weighing scale, symbolising equality. The walls culminate near a pool with fountains. At night, 1,000-foot laser beams rise from the pool, symbolising the heavenward journey of the departed souls.
