LUCKNOW: Class XI student   (16) starts trembling in fear and draws close to his mother  , sitting beside him for a sense of security as he recalls his eight-hour chilling experience of being kidnapped. 

 The fear is so ingrafted that only after much insistence by his parents does Arnav talk to TOI.
 
 "I usually get ready by 8.15am, eat breakfast and leave for school by 8.30am with my driver  . Everything was normal," begins Arnav, recounting the events of Monday morning.
 
 "I was caught unawares when Santosh suddenly brought the vehicle to a screeching halt at   and two men boarded the vehicle. One of them pointed a pistol at me from the front seat while I was gagged and my hands and mouth tied. The driver's tone turned harsh. Hours earlier, he was so polite," said Arnav. 
 
 "I was numb with shock and don't remember who suddenly gave me an injection which put me to sleep."
 
 "When I gained consciousness, I found myself tied-up in a sack in some field. I started rolling and twisting in discomfort. I had no hope of living further, and was praying God saves me," said Arnav.
 
 "After some time, I heard many footsteps. My heart sank thinking if there were more kidnappers," he recalled.
 
 "But then I heard men taking my name loudly. They were asking the kidnappers to surrender. There was some commotion and then someone rescued me."
 
 "As soon as I was set free, I saw my father. I hugged him instantly. I could not stop crying. I felt I was seeing him after a long time," said Arnav, with some calm returning on his face.
 
 "I feel as if it is a rebirth. I was craving my mother," said the boy. His family is still to overcome the trauma it had undergone over the previous 24 hours.
