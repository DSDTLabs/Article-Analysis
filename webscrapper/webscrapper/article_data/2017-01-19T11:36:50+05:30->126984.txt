RANEBENNUR: Three days after   leader   decided to make his torn kurta a political issue,   workers from Haveri in Karnataka sent him a new one to shame him.

 "Rahul Gandhi withdrew Rs.4,000 from the bank 40 days ago. He never returned to the banks. So he doesn't have money to buy new kurta. So we have sent a new kurta from our Yuv Morcha. People will teach him a lesson in the coming days for his attitudes," said a Yuv Morcha leader Shrinivas.
 
 Three days ago, at a meeting with party workers in  , Rahul put his hand in his kurta pocket, then held it up to show it was torn.
 
 "My kurta pocket is torn, and that doesn't matter to me. But you will never see Modiji wearing torn clothes, despite the fact that he claims to represent the poor and plays politics with the poor," the Congress vice president said.
 
 Twitterati took Rahul apart for his flippant comment. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 No one needed reminding that Rahul recently returned from vacation - a short one, albeit one he took abroad. As well, he's the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family, which goes back a long way in history, and is unlikely to be found wanting for a new kurta. 
 At any rate, Rahul's now got a new kurta.
