Udupi: At a time when the coast is simmering with communal tension, the Paryaya crosses religious boundaries. No Paryaya procession is complete without the colorful ‘Birudavali’ , umbrellas, decorated pallaki, ‘Suryapanna’, ‘Chandrapadha’ flags and other decorative items.

 It’s a Muslim family from Hosadurga, Chitradurga district, that spends about six months to complete this work.
 
 Says Hidayathulla, “We got the order for preparing all these items a year ago and from the past six months my family of five has been working on preparing the Birudavali. We have been assembling these items from Palimaru Mutt. We were given a room and food too.”
 
 Hidayatullah’s father K M Anwar Saheb has been doing this job from the age of 14. This is the seventh paryaya that the family is part of. “In our community, these kind of artistic work is comparatively less and we are getting orders from various temples across the state. We are basically farmers and have three acres of land in Chitradurga. We grow pomegranate,” explains Hidayatullah.
 
 Enayathulla, the main artist said, “The project cost about Rs 5 lakh and the materials cost three lakh. This job is our family inheritance. Like during every Paryaya, this year too the Palimaru Mutt contacted us. We are glad to serve the paryaya.”
