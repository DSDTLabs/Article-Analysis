THANE: Investigators has taken the custody of Sagar Thakar, aka  , the 24-year-old alleged mastermind of the   fake call centres that conned hundreds of US citizens of millions of dollars.

 Shaggy was in   after his arrest last month, but the crime branch got back his custody in a second case of the three cases registered with Mira Road police. “We had recently requested the court to give his custody for further investigations. The court granted permission to hand over the custody to the crime branch unit-I on Thursday,” said a police officer.
 
 A police officer said they will question him face to face with his aide Ashish Choudhary, who was arrested from Delhi. Choudhary allegedly helped Shaggy convert the money into cash through various channels and redeemed the 16 digit I-tune code purchased on a threat call from the call centres. “We shall question the duo to unravel other aspects of the case,” said a police officer.
