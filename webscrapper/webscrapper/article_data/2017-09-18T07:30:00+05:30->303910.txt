Chandigarh: The MC is going to open a separate account with the State Bank of India for keeping the revenue it earns from the conversion of leasehold property in the city into freehold.

 The MC and UT administration are planning to spend the revenue earned on the development of the city. A source in the civic body said MC commissioner Baldeo Purushartha had issued orders in this regard and the authority had already selected SBI for the purpose. “The MC and SBI exchanged documents to get done with the formalities a few days ago. The account will be opened in a day or two,” said sources in the MC.
 
 The UT administration will prepare detailed guidelines for the proper utilization of the money. These will then be sent to the central government for the approval. “The Centre had made it clear in the previous meeting that revenue from conversion will be spent on the development of the city,” said a senior official of the UT.
 
 The move is quite crucial, as it will empower the city financially. Before halting conversion of properties in 2013, UT administration was sending the revenue earned from this to the Consolidated Fund of India and was not receiving the same amount of money. “The clause is not a new, but mentioned in the order of 1997. UT did not open an account here and was sending the amount to the central government. The most crucial part is that MC will be opening the account, but only the administration will keep control of the money. The administrator has already issued the orders in this regard,” said a senior officer monitoring the case.
