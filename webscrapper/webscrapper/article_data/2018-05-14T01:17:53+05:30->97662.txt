NEW DELHI:   Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday responded to   letter on the   with a   of his own, accusing the LG of trying to “politicise” the important issue of women safety. “You have stated that you have not stopped the CCTV project. A simple question that arises then is why did you set up this committee? Obviously, it has been done to create hurdles for the elected government (sic),” the CM wrote.

 “You have further said that more than 2 lakh cameras were installed by other agencies in the last two years. Why didn’t you set up any committee then?   is the most high-security area of Delhi and they have installed several thousand cameras in the last two years. Why did you not set up a committee then? Now, when Delhi government wants to install CCTV cameras, you have set up this committee arbitrarily, bypassing the elected government,” he added.
 
 “If the committees will make laws, rules, policies and framework, then what will cabinets, parliaments and assemblies do?” he asked.
 
 Claiming that LG’s move to set up the committee amounted to a violation of the Constitution, Kejriwal asked: “Which law gives powers to LG to set up such a committee to frame regulatory framework and make laws and rules for installing CCTV cameras? There is a Constitution and there are laws and LG is bound by those laws and the Constitution. Why are you violating the Constitution?”
 
 When a successful model for CCTVs was running in NDMC areas, why had LG rejected that standard operating procedure, he asked. Kejriwal said the AAP government rejected the LG-formed committee as it had been set up to create “hurdles” and was without any legal basis and jurisdiction. He added: “We feel sorry that you have chosen to call a meeting request by elected representatives of Delhi on an issue of extreme public importance an exercise in public posturing. We are all coming tomorrow. We hope you will find time to meet us.”
