KALIMPONG/DARJEELING: The death of a   worker — the ninth death in Darjeeling since June — and the Centre’s “silence”, despite the worsening situation in the Hills, prompted   proponents to decide to take their agitation to Delhi from August and push the   governor and the “friendly government” in Sikkim to take up the separate statehood cause.

 The   will have its next meeting in Delhi on August 1 when it will start the next phase of its agitation, which will include hunger strikes and coincide with the monsoon session of Parliament. Its leadership admitted the decision was prompted by the “increasing feeling of hopelessness” at the Centre’s lack of response to the stir that would be entering its seventh week on Thursday.
 
 The decision followed the death of GJM supporter Ashish Tamang in Mirik late on Monday. GJM spokesperson Binay Tamang said the 36-year-old was killed in police firing after a clash between GJM and Trinamool Congress supporters. “The police opened fire at GJM supporters near Mirik Market,” Binay said. The clash, he claimed, broke out after Morcha supporters demanded that seven Trinamool members of Mirik Municipality resign immediately.
 
 Police officers, however, denied any firing. A large contingent of police rushed to the spot around 8pm and charged teargas shells to disperse the mob when the crowd started pelting stones. “Our forces baton-charged and lobbed teargas shells,” a senior officer said. The Trinamool claimed a supporter, Nawaz Tamang, was injured in the attack and was battling for life at a Siliguri nursing home. Nawaz, Trinamool leaders said, was injured in a clash in Mirik on Monday night.
