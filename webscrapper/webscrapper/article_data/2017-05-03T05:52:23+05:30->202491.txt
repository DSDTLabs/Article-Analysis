BENGALURU: It’s official.   service on the entire Nagasandra-Puttenahalli stretch will be launched by this month-end.

 Chief minister Siddaramaiah has written to President Pranab Mukherjee, seeking a time and date for the launch of   I in its entirety. “The CM is hoping to get the date sometime in the last week of May,” the CMO’s office said.
 
 Putting an end to speculation, Bengaluru development minister   on Tuesday said the commissioner of railway safety may be invited to inspect the remaining stretch of the north-south corridor (Green Line) on May 12 to ensure its launch by month-end. The corridor covers a distance of 24.2km and connects some major hubs.
 
 George said when the   government took over in 2013, it managed to complete the pending 36km stretch of the total 42km, while only 6km of Phase 1 had been completed during BJP’s tenure. The cost of Phase-1 has escalated by Rs 2,000 crore and the project today stands at Rs 13,805 crore. The deadlines for Phase 1 have been pushed since December 2012.
 
 Options to ease traffic 
 
 George said the government is exploring several possibilities like constructing tunnels or elevated corridors to ease congestion on Ballari Road and other parts of the city. He said the proposed tunnels in four parts of Bengaluru, including one on Ballari Road, is not the only option being discussed. “We are considering elevated roads as well to ease traffic congestion, if necessary. The discussions are in preliminary stage,” he added.
