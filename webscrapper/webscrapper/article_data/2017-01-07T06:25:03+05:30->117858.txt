NAVI MUMBAI: The state government has   the   for recruitment of   (motor vehicles). The state will be looking to appoint 1,000 assistant inspectors at 50 transport offices.

 According to sources, the amendment comes after a tepid response to the last recruitment drive, according to sources. The forms for the appointments will be filled up shortly.
 
 The new rule states permanent driving licence for light motor vehicle should be procured by applicants before the date on which the advertisement for recruitment appears or a 30-month car driving experience prior to that. There’s a six-week window period before the exams and the applicants can get the licence after passing the required test before that.
 
 It has also dispensed with the mandatory requirement of driving licences for heavy vehicles and one-year experience of garage work for applications from mechanical and automobile engineers, said Dole.
 
 The transport offices have been facing a staff crunch and a Bombay high court order looked into the need for more manpower to ensure stronger infrastructure.
 
 The transport department felt that several applicants who had automobile or mechanical engineers’ degree or diplomas felt shy to obtain heavy vehicle licence like trucks and so their numbers had dipped.
 
 The Bombay high court’s interim order in October 2014 to a 2013 PIL asked for proper infrastructure to monitor vehicles, said Sanjay Dole, Vashi deputy RTO. He added that better monitoring always required more people in the offices.
