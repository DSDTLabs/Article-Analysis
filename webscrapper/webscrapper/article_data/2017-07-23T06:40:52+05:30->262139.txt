BENGALURU: 
 

 
 We fail to understand the broader meaning of fraternity, which is very strong and includes humanity as a whole. In India, we have segregated fraternity -a Brahmin feeling of fraternity for fellow   or the fraternity of the powerful -which does not include all sections of people. So even if civil rights are guaranteed, discrimination continues as people don't share that sense of belongingness with everybody. The Indian polity has failed to internalize the spirit of fraternity.
 
 
 
 Dalit leaders are themselves only symbols. We've not had a single role model since Ambedkar and the few that manage to occupy chambers of power are only symbolic. But we need such representations as an inspiration to others. The main problem with those in power is that they co-opt Dalit leaders instead of addressing the problems faced by them. The lure of power has seen several leaders of social movements switch sides.
 
 
 
 There is a larger problem. People in power do not believe in equality, even if they speak about it. Even when the Constitution was drawn up, not everybody who agreed to introduce it believed in what it contained, and that's the tragedy. The state has no respect for social movements. We speak of democracy but suppress people.
