CHENNAI: Three days after the death of a   Murugantham Kaliyan, 54, who was one of the 11 killed in a fire   at   reported on July 12, his family members are still clueless as to how to retrieve the body of the sole breadwinner of their family.

 Kaliyan’s family claimed they hardly get information from the Indian external affairs ministry in Delhi. “It is very strange not even the local councilor or the sitting MLA of the constituency approached and consoleed or assisted us to get my father’s body,” said Kaliyan’s son Karthik.
 
  
  
 
 
 
  G Mathialagan said, “We were surprised as the Ramavaram taluk officials were ignorant of the death of a construction worker, hailing from Ramavaram, who died in fire accident at Saudi Arabia. Moreover, we are expecting that the state government would do something to help our family by communicating and getting in touch with the Indian Embassy officials in Saudi Arabia.” Kaliyan’s family was informed that of the 17 people who stayed at the quarters in an apartment, 11 people were charred to death, while six others were critically wounded and admitted to a private hospital.
 
 Kaliyan spoke to his wife Lakshmi, 48, daughter M Tamil Selvi and son Karthik on July 11, just few hours before he was trapped in the fire. Kaliyan last visited Chennai to attend his daughter’s marriage in 2016. Mathialagan, employed at a private company, said, “Kaliyan had planned to return to Chennai, hoping to settle all the pending dues which he had borrowed for his daughter’s marriage.”
 
 “I should thank my company owner’s daughter who took the issue to the MEA office in Delhi and we are getting information from some friends staying in Saudi Arabia. We are trying hard to get his body back,” said Mathialagan. Kaliyan and his wife Lakshmi are natives of Thanjavur and settled in Ramavaram three decades ago.
