YAVATMAL: The Aadhaar cards found thrown into a well at   in   city were allegedly disposed off by postal department employees tasked with home delivery of the cards. The tehsildar has filed an FIR regarding the recovery of the cards by youths cleaning the well.

 “The cards recovered were issued from 2011 to 2014 by UIDAI,” Shejal said, adding the postal department would be asked to verify the employees working in the Lohara area during the period, and identify those to be prosecuted.
 
 “I have filed an FIR, and ordered civic body to check other abandoned wells to see if more such Aadhaar cards or important documents sent via the postal department have been thrown in the wells,” Shejal said.
 
 “Aadhaar issuing authority, UIDAI, pays Rs7 per card to the postal department to deliver the cards,” said Shejal.
