PANAJI: Vishnu Surya Wagh remains the tiger as his name suggests and is hopeful that despite his recent health woes, the BJP will reward him with a ticket for the coming  . 

 Depending on assurances given by the saffron party that all 21 sitting MLAs would retain their candidature, Aruna Wagh, Vishnu’s wife sees no reason why her husband cannot contest and win the elections.
 
 “I thought all 21 MLAs would get the ticket. The party has time and can decide to give him a ticket,” Aruna said, and went on to point out that the BJP was in power at the Centre and in Goa too.
 
 “Defence minister Manohar Parrikar is a powerful person. If he wants Vishnu to stand and Vishnu to win, he can do it. If people can get elected from jail, then Vishnu can also win,” Aruna told TOI.
 
 Aruna said that her husband was a “nice soul” and a “versatile leader” who had a pull with the masses to get elected despite his health limitations.
