GURUGRAM: High traffic volume is an everyday reality on the roads of Millennium City, which hosted the country’s first   day in November 2013 to promote people-friendly streets. Three years on, the city has   only in Sector 45 and Old Gurgaon area, which are in a deplorable condition.

 On Sunday, in another bid to encourage   among residents, a first-of-its-kind in the state parking project — ‘Seeds For Change’ — was inaugurated in Sector 29. Under it, four car   in the area have been turned into cycle stands. The project, launched by MCG commissioner V Umashankar and police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar, has been initiated by World Research India (WRI) Institute, in partnership with NGO Udaan and NASSCOM Foundation. 
 
 The organisations associated with the project believe such re-imagining of parking space will not only sensitise people towards walking and cycling, but also pave the way for creating ‘cycle-able’ cities. The reality, though, is the city has cycle tracks in only two areas, both of which are crying for maintenance. In 2015, MCG announced it would build at least six tracks in the city. MCG officials claim they’re waiting for approval from the urban local bodies department in Chandigarh for four remaining stretches — Iffco Chowk to Mahavir Chowk, Old Delhi-Gurgaon road, Khandsa road and Sohna road, for a year and a half.
 
 The city has huge volume of cars. Every day, three lakh cars enter Gurgaon from Delhi-NCR, and there’s an equal number within the city, according to rough estimates. Around 70,000 industrial workers use cycles to commute to work.
