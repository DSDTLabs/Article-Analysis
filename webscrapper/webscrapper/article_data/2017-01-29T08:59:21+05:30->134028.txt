VIJAYAWADA: The state government's decision to hold this year's   has come as a rude shock to final year Intermediate students, particularly those studying in  . Interestingly, some private and corporate colleges have started preparing their students to the new mode of examination. It is the government college students who stand to lose because of the sudden decision, say student and teachers' unions. 

 Government college students are always at the receiving end when it comes to cracking entrance tests due to lack of additional facilities like special coaching which are usually provided by private and corporate colleges. "I am preparing for Eamcet at home and am unaware of the change in the test pattern. My parents are construction workers and I can't ask them to buy a computer or send me to a coaching institute just for the sake of preparing for the exam, said Nasreen, a topper of the MPC final year batch at government Junior College in Payakapuram. 
 
 College principal C S S N Reddy said, "We motivate our students to join   and take the help of nearby engineering colleges to train Eamcet aspirants. This year too, we are expecting a few   to train them for the online entrance exam.
 
 Demanding that the government provide both online and offline test options, SFI state secretary Noor Mohammed said, "Rural and government college students have to bear the brunt of the government's decision. They lack awareness and the required infrastructure to compete with urban and corporate college students who use computers from a young age.
