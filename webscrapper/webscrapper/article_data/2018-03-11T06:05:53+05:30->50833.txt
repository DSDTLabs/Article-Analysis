MUMBAI: If you go to withdraw money from an ATM and discover the keypad is jammed, make sure you alert the bank’s customer care immediately. Two teenagers were arrested on Friday for using the trick to get hold of the PIN number of card-holders to withdraw Rs20,000.

 The fraud came to light when the DN Nagar police received complaints from a 40-year-old hotel manager, KG Pillai and a 42-year-old housewife on February 20 and 28, claiming they had lost Rs10,000 each. Based on the complaint, a team scanned   grabs and kept a watch on the ATMs.   (19) and   (19) were nabbed when they were about to strike at an ATM.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 According to police, the accused are   residents who claimed to be students at an aviation institute in Andheri. The duo has committed over a dozen such frauds in the past three months. However, investigators suspect they have been at it for longer.
 
 The duo used to target only ATM centres of Kotak Bank in Andheri (West) which are unmanned after 7pm.
 
 Explaining the modus operandi, DCP   told TOI, “The accused used glue to stick two buttons (* and # keys which are on either side of ‘0’ button on the keypad).”
 
 Elaborating further, he said the trick is executed when one of the accused present in the ATM acts as if he is unable to withdraw money and asks an unsuspecting customer in the queue to give it a shot. When the victim inserts his/her card, the accused memorizes the PIN. The screen soon freezes and the transaction cannot be completed or cancelled. The victim leaves the premises thinking the transaction has failed or the machine has developed a glitch. At this point, the second accused enters, uses the PIN after removing the glue and withdraws money. In all cases, the cardholders remained unaware the machine had been tampered.
