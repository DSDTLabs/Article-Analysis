CHENNAI: Rejecting a mourning father's plea to give back his son's body, who was killed in the   police shooting eight days ago to perform the last rites, the Madras high court on Wednesday ordered re-post mortem of seven bodies of the 13 killed in the incident. 

 Granting the interim relief sought by a group of public interest litigators, including lawyers, a vacation bench of Justice S Baskar and Justice R M T Teekaaraman said that the re-post mortem shall be conducted in the presence of a doctor not below the rank of reader from AIIMS, JIPMER, Puducherry or Government Medical College, Trivandrum, Kerala.
 
 The plea was filed by father of   victim B Shanmugam.
 
 In view of the order, Shanmugam's body would also be subject to re-post mortem.
 
 As to the post mortem of the remaining six bodies, the petitioners propose to prefer an appeal before the Supreme Court.
 
 This apart, considering apprehension expressed by the state, the court directed the authorities to hand over the bodies after autopsy only to the relatives of the deceased in the government hospital or mortuary and except the relatives, no other persons shall be permitted in the premises of the hospital at the time of handing over.
 
 "The officials are also hereby directed to ensure peaceful performance of the last rituals without any law and order problem in the respective area," the bench said.
 
 Earlier when the pleas were taken up for hearing, advocate general Vijay Narayan submitted that autopsy on seven bodies have been already completed with strict compliance of guidelines set by the apex court in the presence of judicial magistrates with video recording. Adding that the post mortem reports suggest that the cause of the death was due to bullet injury, Narayan said, "Now it is an admitted fact that the seven died of bullet injuries. When such a fact is not disputed necessity to conduct re-post mortem would not arise."
