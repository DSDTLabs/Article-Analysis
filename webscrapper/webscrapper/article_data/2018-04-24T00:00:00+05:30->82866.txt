And again, Chennai went all out to recognise transgender achievers. That clearly showed how inclusive the city is and should be. The awardees included medical students, entrepreneurs, social activists, a physiotherapist and a model. Spotted among others was Aruvi actress  . In a fuss-free sleeveless top and matching printed skirt, she looked every bit pretty. The film was also acknowledged during the award function for the sensitive way in which transgenders were portrayed in it.
