NEW DELHI:   MP   came down hard on women and child welfare minister   on Tuesday over her love for animals alleging that for her a human being may die but a dog must never be hurt.

 Participating in the discussion on agrarian crisis in the Rajys Sabha, Yadav said stray dogs bite shoppers at Khan Market. “Once I asked one of the shop owners why don’t they remove the dogs? He said you have a minister named Maneka Sanjay Gandhi; she does not allow us to remove the dogs, files FIR.”
 
 Continuing to train guns at the WCD minister, who was not present in the House, Yadav said one farmers told him that he could save only 35 quintals of moong dal against 235 quintals a year back as the cattle are let free. “There is one minister in our country who has given an order that no one should tie any animal. People do not understand that if cows and buffaloes are not tied at homes, how can they be milked?” he asked.
