CHANDIGARH: A stalker murdered an 18-year-old girl in the bustling Grain Market in Sector 26 in broad daylight on Friday, but the 18-year-old could have been saved had the crowd called for help immediately instead of taking her pictures.

 The accused approached her, demanding she go with him. When she did not show any interest,   got furious and slit her throat with a sharp-edged weapon, police said. Pooja tried to escape and ran for around 100 metre till she collapsed near shop number 26. As she lay alive in a pool of blood, a crowd gathered and began to take her pictures with their mobile phones. The girl lied in the market for around 20 minutes but nobody called the police. Only later, shopkeeper called up police helpline number 100. A PCR (police control room) vehicle took the girl to PGI, where she succumbed to her injuries before naming Sunil as her killer.
 
 On the statement of Jyoti, the Sector 26 police registered a case against Sunil and later caught him from Timber Market in Sector 26. Police also recovered a knife and his blood-stained clothes. Police would produce him in a local court on Saturday.
