GUWAHATI: With incidents of   against women being reported from across the country, police have asked all   providers here to incorporate an emergency (SOS) button on their respective apps. 

 This would ensure that a passenger caught in an   can tap the button and send an   to the police control room or to pre-defined emergency numbers set by him or her.
 
 The police issued the order following repeated complaints from commuters. "Police have been discussing safety issues with cab service providers. They have been directed to include an 'SOS' button on their respective apps. The button will immediately send an alert to the police control room and to select contacts of the passenger," a senior officer said.
 
 He added that the   would also send the drivers' details and the vehicle's registration number to the control room. Sources, however, said city police's control room would also need an infrastructure upgrade so that commuters could avail themselves of the SOS button service effectively. Till the control room is upgraded, the SOS button will guide passengers to call police (Dial 100), sources added.
 
 "The demand for app cabs have increased. As a result, service providers have been forced to recruit drivers without checking their antecedents. This is quite dangerous. We have come across incidents of hardened criminals being recruited as drivers," police added.
 
 Cab service providers have been asked to prepare a list of drivers employed by them along with photographs and to submit them to police.
 
 Last week, Kamrup (Metro) district administration launched a toll-free helpline '181' for women affected by violence. It also launched a centre - 'Sakhi One Stop Centre' - for such women at Rajgarh. The helpline and the centre will provide comprehensive care to women facing physical, sexual, emotional, psychological and economic abuse irrespective of their age, class, caste, educational status, marital status and race.
