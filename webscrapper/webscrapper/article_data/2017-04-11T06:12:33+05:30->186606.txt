AHMEDABAD: To promote friendship between India and Pakistan, students of social movement class at the   (IIT-Gn) have proposed to hold peace events at Wagah-Attari border, instead of the beating retreat ceremony.

 The proposal has been made by 35 students of the social movement class under the mentorship of Ramon Magsaysay awardee and a visiting faculty at IIT-Gn, Sandeep Pandey.
 
 Pandey said that they have proposed an innovative alternative to promote better people-to-people relation between India and Pakistan aimed at mutual acceptance, peace and love, which could bring the two nations closer.
 
 The proposal suggests that instead of this military drill, the space can be used every day to unite the minds of the diverse crowd through a cultural exchange event spreading the message of peace and friendship. This space can also be a platform for reuniting the people displaced and separated during the partition.
 
 “The degree of enmity between the two countries will get reduced, if people are allowed to meet freely. Under the proposed programme, students, artists, children, literary personalities, women, professionals and activists can undertake joint constructive activities,” Pandey said.
 
 “Instead of holding beating the retreat ceremony, which runs for 45-odd minutes, a peace ceremony can be held to ensure peace and friendship between the two countries. If there are security concerns, the people can be frisked thoroughly like it is done at the airport,” Pandey added.
 
 Gopal Singh, a student of the course, said that it was a tough task for them to make people understand that friendship can be assured between India and Pakistan in present atmosphere but gradually they realize that there is no benefit in promoting enmity between the two countries.
 
 A formal proposal will be soon put up before the ministry of external affairs and the ministry of home affairs. The same proposal is likely to be sent to the Pakistan government.
