HYDERABAD: The   (ED) investigating the money laundering angle of the YSR Congress chief Y S   disproportionate assets case on Friday attached 11,804 acres in Guntur and Prakasam districts allotted to two firms floated by businessman Nimmagadda Prasad. 

  Ports Pvt Ltd and Vanpic Projects Ltd were allotted huge tracts of land for the proposed Vadarevu and   and Industrial Corridor (VANPIC) by   in 2008. The CBI, which took up the probe into the Jagan assets case, filed a separate chargesheet on this Vanpic episode. While the state entered into an agreement with Vanpic Ports, the land was transferred to Vanpic Projects. The   described it as a conspiracy hatched in connivance with official machinery. The state's then revenue minister along with the ports minister and then revenue principal secretary were all made accused. The CBI has made Nimmagadda Prasad prime accused in the case and charged him with getting undue benefits from the state.
 
 Nimmagadda, in turn, made huge investments in the Jagan firms as part of a quid pro quo deal, the CBI said in its chargesheet. Though there was a talk about Ras Al Khaimah in Dubai being a principal partner with AP, Nimmagadda was initially shown as an agent of RAK. Later, the CBI probe revealed that RAK was made to exit midway and Nimmagadda emerged as the main beneficiary of the state's agreement.
 
 Subsequently, ED took up the probe under the pro visions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
 
 Last year, it attached 1416 acres of Vanpic land.Now it has attached 11,804 acres and issued a provisional attachment order.
 
 Though the state was planning to hand over nearly 30,000 acres to Nimmagadda, it could issue GOs only to the extent that were attached.
 
 The probe regarding the conspiracy angle is still going on.
