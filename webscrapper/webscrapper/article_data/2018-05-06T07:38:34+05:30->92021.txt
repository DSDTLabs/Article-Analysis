PANAJI: The   ( ), Goa, has approached the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) for an enviromental clearnace to double the passengerhandling capacity at   international airport.

 
 The AAI wants to hike its capacity from 6.8 million to 11.2 million by 2021 by extending the existing integrated terminal building and apron. The current integrated terminal building, which handles both domestic and international passengers, is near saturated.
 
 An expert appraisal committee ( ) of the MoEFCC has issued the terms of reference to conduct the environmental impact assessment (EIA) study for the proposed expansion. After the EIA study is completed, the panel has recommended public consultation, and that the comments of the public hearing be incorporated in the EIA study.
 
 The present proposal is to extend the existing building towards the east by demolishing the old terminal building, internally modifying the existing terminal building, and extending the existing apron to the east.
 
 As per the terms of reference, the EIA will have to submit a justification for land requirement along with a comparison to guidelines established by the AAI and ministry of civil aviation. It also is expected to submit a complete status and compliance report with regards to any earlier EC granted and permissions and consents from the the respective pollution boards for existing facilities.
