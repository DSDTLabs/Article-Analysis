MUMBAI: The city’s crime branch police arrested a 38-year-old businessman on Friday for raping an yesteryear actress after promising to marry her. Sarfaraz Ehsaan Khan alias Anoop Khanna has also been accused of duping the Bollywood sex symbol of the 1970s and ’80s of Rs 15 crore by promising her four flats in the western suburbs. 

 Last month, the Juhu police had arrested Khan after he allegedly tried to forcibly enter her flat in the middle of night. He allegedly threatened the actress’s watchman before leaving, and then accosted her the next day while she was leaving her house. He was released on bail soon after. 
 
 Police said Khan was introduced to the actress during a Bollywood show in the city in 2011. Soon, the businessman befriended her saying he could get her flats in   and Santacruz at throwaway prices. Police said as he got intimate with her by promising to marry her, she filed a complaint of rape also. “He even had a fake nikahnama with the actress,” a police officer said.
 
 “He took cash and gold jewellery totally worth over Rs 15 crore from her on the pretext of buying her flats. When she refused to give him more jewellery, he forged documents of four flats to show they had been transferred to her,” the officer said. One of the flats is in Santacruz, but when the actress started living there she learned that it belonged to somebody else.
 
 According to cops, Khan used to threaten the actress with dire consequences whenever she refused to entertain him or threatened to file a police complaint against him.
 
 Khan, who was arrested on Friday for rape, outraging the modesty of a woman, cheating and forgery, was produced before the 37th Metropolitan Magistrate court which remanded him in police custody till March 26. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Nisar Tamboli said the accused has two previous offences of similar cheating registered against him in the western suburbs.
