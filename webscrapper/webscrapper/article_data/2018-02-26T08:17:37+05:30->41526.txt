THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: On Saturday evening, renowned south Indian actor   received an old photograph via email from   still photographer  . The black and white photo, taken 40 years ago at Shoranur during the shoot of Thulavarsham, shows Hema with a young  , the latter helping her drape a mundu. Hours later, the shocking news reached Hema –the most-celebrated actor the country has ever seen has gone too soon.

 “Now, I have the photo, but the person in it is no more,” said Hema over the phone from Bengaluru.
 
 Gopalakrishnan had visited Hema recently for an interview for his upcoming book on actor Prem Nazir. “While recollecting the days I worked in Malayalam films, I requested him to send across this particular photo. He promptly mailed it to me. Next day early morning I got a call from actor Lekshmi informing the unfortunate news,’’ Hema said.
 
 Thulavarsham marked the debut of Hema in Malayalam cinema. “That was 40 years ago. I was 19 or 20 year old then and she was just 12 or 13. Recently, I met Sridevi at a wedding. She came running to me calling ‘Hemaji’ and hugged me. The same old affection was there, nothing seemed to have changed after all these years,” Hema said.
 
 She recalled the shooting days in Palakkad and Shorannur, where Sridevi used to roam around and hurried to a nearby park after work.
 
 “There are stars and there are artists. Sridevi was both, a complete woman,” Hema recalled the unparalleled journey of her junior co-actor.
 
 As a mother, Sridevi was very much like her ryear actor said. “Sridevi’s mother was very particular about her daughter’s future; she wished for and saw her scaling heights. Sridevi had big plans for her children, especially her elder daughter  , but she left without realising those dreams,” she said.
 
 “Sridevi was a phenomenon. Usually heroines wish to share the screen with superstars, but she was the only one with whom all heroes longed to act,” she said.
