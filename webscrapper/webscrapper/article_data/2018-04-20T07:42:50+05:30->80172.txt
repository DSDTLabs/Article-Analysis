COLVA: The high   of Bombay at Goa, on Thursday, passed an   directing the   (GU) and   to permit Sharmad Pai Kane, a third year student of LLB, to answer his   exam.

 After hearing all parties, the high court bench comprising Judges N M Jamdar and Prithviraj K Chavan allowed the student to answer the semester exam, subject to the final outcome of the petition. The student had earlier complained to the management of the college and the Goa University vice-chancellor that he was discriminated against by the principal and was not being permitted to answer his final semester despite having sufficient attendance.
 
 Having failed to obtain any relief, Kane approached the high court. In the petition, he alleged that the principal discriminated against him by permitting other students with less attendance to answer the exams, and that only after he protested were those students prevented from answering the exams.
 
 It was further submitted in the petition that the college failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of the GU ordinance that mandates that the college should send monthly attendance sheets to GU as well as display the same every month on the notice board. The college argued that the student did not have sufficient attendance. The matter is now posted for argument in June. Advocate Gaurish Agni appeared on behalf of the law student.
