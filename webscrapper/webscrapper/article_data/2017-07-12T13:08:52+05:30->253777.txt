PUNE: The Bhosari police on Tuesday   a 27-year-old   of a popular   serial for allegedly robbing a man and attempting to file a fabricated rape case against him. 

 The police have also arrested a 50-year-old man from Kharalwadi in Pimpri and a 24-year-old woman from Nehrunagar in Pimpri along with the actress.
 
 The policemen on duty became suspicious when the actress and her accomplices came to the police station to   the complaint and they decided to cross-check the facts mentioned in the complaint.
 
 Senior inspector Dilip Kulkarni said the actress had visited the police station earlier also claiming that a man had raped her. She had given a different name then and claimed that she was from Kolhapur. 
 
 This time, she gave her real name and revealed that she was working in a TV serial.
 
 After further investigations, it was found that the actress had been lodging complaints against men using different names and was a resident of Hadapsar.
 
 On Saturday, they had robbed a man in Bhosari and were at the police station on Tuesday to lodge a complaint of rape against the man whom they had robbed. 
 
 They contacted the man, who is an interior decorator, suspecting that he was a land developer. They took him to an isolated spot and demanded Rs 5 lakh from him. 
 
 They allowed him to go after realising that he was an interior decorator and not a developer. But they did not let him go like that. Before releasing him, they snatched Rs 6,000 from him. They had planned to lodge a complaint against the man before he could approach the police with the robbery complaint.
 
 All the three arrested suspects — the Hindi TV serial actress and her   accomplices — were produced in the Pimpri court. The judge remanded the three persons in two-day police custody.
