NEW DELHI: Sending a strong signal against encroachments on public land, Delhi high court on Tuesday allowed   to remove   from a horticulture park in   Delhi.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar refused to stay the ongoing demolition exercise in which DDA razed more than 100 temporary and pucca structures encroaching Amir Khusro Park next to Sundar Nagar.
 
 The court demanded proof when an association argued on Tuesday that the land has been given to the affected people by the waqf board.
 
 HC made it clear it won’t tolerate unauthorised constructions on government land. It also reiterated the earlier direction where it had threatened contempt proceedings against DDA and   if they failed to clear the green zone of encroachers.
 
 Appearing for DDA, standing counsel   on Tuesday informed the court that the agency’s demolition team had found a mini-factory and a temporary air conditioning rental office operating inside the horticulture park.
 
 “Several encroachers have rented out the DDA land to others on a monthly basis. After dusk it becomes a hub of illegal activities,” he told the court after which the bench gave its nod to carry out demolition.
 
 Last month, while hearing a PIL filed by Savyasachi Sahai, HC had issued directions to the authorities to remove encroachers inside and around the 12.8-acre Amir Khusro Park that also borders Lala Lajpat Rai Marg and Lodhi Road.
 
 Earlier, the court had instructed DDA to conduct a survey and find out who the encroachers were before removing them. DDA had pleaded helplessness saying there are many families residing in the area, so the agency cannot just run a bulldozer. HC had then sought a detailed report and also ordered the police to cooperate with the civic agency in removing illegal construction.
