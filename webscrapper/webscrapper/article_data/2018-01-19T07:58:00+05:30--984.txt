Noida: Noida Authority on Wednesday provided 10 more   bikes to the   to ensure smooth traffic system in the city. The white coloured   were flagged off in presence of Noida Authority ACEO R K Mishra and SP City Arun Kumar Singh. This is an extension to ‘Garud Squad’ that launched in September last year. Mishra said that the new bikes are an extension to the sustained efforts in improving traffic system. 

 “There was need of patrolling bikes to unclog traffic jam at certain points. There were also complaints of non-functional traffic signals. The police personnel will be able to reach at the spot on time on getting information and ease the jam or solve other problem, if any,” he said.
 
 In September, the traffic police had received 30 patrolling bikes under this scheme to ensure that roads are free from congestion and encroachment. 
 
 Anil Kumar Jha, SP (traffic) Noida said that each bike will cover some distance between two points. “The police personnel have been given responsibilities to frequently patrol the stretch and improve people’s travelling experience in the city,” he said.
