NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of Indian athletes breaching the   organisers’ no-needle policy inside the athletes’ village,   ( ) president   on Thursday asked the national sports federations (NSFs) to implement the no-needle policy in all the national camps at the earliest. To avoid such future incidents at the multi-sport events, Batra said it’s important to educate the athletes about its implications.

 
 “I would like to request all the NSFs to strictly implement the no-needle policy,” said Batra, with IOC president   sitting next to him.
 
 Even before Batra exhorted federations to ensure the no-needle policy in camps, the   (BFI), led by  , has become the first federation to implement the rule on its own at both its men’s and women’s national camps in Patiala and Delhi, respectively.
 
 BFI president Singh told TOI: “We have implemented this international policy at all our camps in the strictest way.
 
 “To ensure its proper implementation, our team from the BFI will make surprise visits to these camps. We will do everything possible to ensure that all our men, women and junior boxers as well as coaches and support staff adhere to it.”
