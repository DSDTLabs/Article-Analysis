PATIALA: In a move that could spell trouble for   in renewing its affiliation, a two-member panel of   has expressed dissatisfaction over its state of affairs. 

  Vijayant Bhardwaj and S D Sharma from the university descended on the college premises and inspected various wings and had an overview of the administrative working of the college. It was affiliated with Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, from 1999-2011. The college was brought under the Ayurvedic university in 2011. 
 
 The panel members found that the college had been running short of staff as various faculty positions were lying vacant. A scrutiny of records showed the footfall of the patients department had been distressingly low, while the medicine stock was also found to be inadequate. 
 
  Later, interacting with mediapersons, Bhardwaj said the college, which was one of the premier ayurvedic institutions in north India, was now in need of a major revamp. He said that there were 30 posts of lecturers while the college had been functioning with 24. Out of these, six were found to be "ineligible" as per the criteria laid down by the   (CCIM). 
 
  He said the panel would submit its report to the university for taking suitable decision in regard with extending the affiliation. The members also interacted with the faculty members to get an inside view of other problems. The college had not been allowed to admit any students in both undergraduate and post graduate courses in 2011, 2012 and 2013 session owing to shortage of teaching staff and other facilities.
