MUMBAI: In a directive issued on Friday, the state transport department has stated   kits retrofitted in 2.6 lakh private cars, 2.4 lakh autorickshaws, 62,000 taxis and around 3,500 buses in Mumbai metropolitan region should be thoroughly tested and certified every three years.

 In view of protests against the exorbitant testing fees, the department has reduced the charges for CNG tests by Rs 1,500. â€œWe welcome the decision as the rates had been hiked from Rs 1,200 to Rs 4,000. It will now cost Rs 2,500 to get CNG cylinders checked, said auto union leader  . Underlining the need for safety checks, he said there have been cases of cylinder explosion in vehicles which did not go through proper test procedures.
 
 Rates will be reviewed on July 31 to assess if they can be further slashed, an official added.
