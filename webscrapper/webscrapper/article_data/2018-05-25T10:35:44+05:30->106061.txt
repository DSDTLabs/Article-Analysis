THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even while seeking a benign audience to a proposition that subtly pointed out the dangers behind the reckless promotion of a highly homogenised higher education arena, Kerala has submitted its higher education plan before the   (RUSA). The plan is a major prerequisite for states seeking funding from   under various categories. 

 
 According to sources, the state project directorate of RUSA submitted the vision document on May 15. Despite being short of highly accredited  , the state project directorate has submitted plans for financial assistance under seven of the total 14 schemes envisaged in RUSA's revised guidelines.
 
 The major scheme in the revised guideline is an assistance up to Rs 55 crore to autonomous institutions with   accreditation and minimum 3.51 GCPA (cumulative grade point average), for upgrading them into universities. However, absence of any such institutions in the government sector has obliterated the state's possibilities to pitch for big ticket programmes. Both autonomous and non-autonomous colleges in aided sector would be the major beneficiaries, if RUSA approves the state's request.
 
 "After initial deliberations, the education department has set aside plans for giving autonomous status to more colleges in government sector. The higher education plan has staked claim for RUSA funding (Rs 2 crore each) for infrastructure development in aided colleges. The government has also declared no objection towards autonomous colleges seeking special funding from RUSA. Of the 19 autonomous colleges in the state, 18 are in aided sector. These colleges are eligible for a one-time assistance of Rs 5 crore from RUSA," sources said. Assistance has also been sought for a  . A Rs 7 crore assistance to academic staff college is another major demand the state has placed before RUSA.
