LUCKNOW: Lucknow University has rolled back its decision of making   to its six   for the   2018-19. The decision was taken after the university received only 75 application from CAT scorers for admission against its 540 MBA seats. It will now conduct Lucknow University Management Entrance Test (LUMET). “LU had to revise its decision of making   due to very less applications. A huge number of seats would have remained vacant, so it was decided to hold LUMET,” said an LU official.

 “We have been admitting students through CAT scores and entrance test for past several years. This year, we decided to take admissions only through CAT scores. However, since many seats were vacant, we have decided to switch back to old process,” said LU vice-chancellor SP Singh.
 
 Candidates who did not appear in Common Admission Test can now pursue MBA from Lucknow University.
 
 Even candidates who scored low in CAT can appear in entrance test for a good rank in the merit list. The test would be followed by a personal interview and the sum total of CAT or LUMET and interview will decide the merit. LUMET will be a gateway for admissions to MBA courses offered by the department of business administration and Institute of Management Sciences.
