Little comforts can make life easier. A small thought to make the tedious scarf tying procedure simpler and comfortable inspired 20-year-old Vaishnavi Hatrote, a third-year Chemical Engineering student, to start her own business. She has proved that entrepreneurship is not taught to anybody, and that ideas emerge from mere observations.

 Traditional scarves are an art; one needs to know just how to tie them. Vaishnavi, who, like many women, faced a problem while tying scarves invented a new simple technique and decided to work on it.   (20), a third-year   student, joined hands with Vaishnavi to manufacture simple, easy-to-wear scarfs —  . The two have been successfully juggling studying and working. After attending college, they set aside a few hours to their startup every day.
 
 Vaishnavi and Supriya’s scarves, priced between `100 and `130, are made of cotton and are easy to wear. Their startup has received a boost from LEAD (LEaders Accelerating Development programme) and in the first phase, they received capital of Rs 2 lakh.
 
 Speaking to us, Vaishnavi says, “My startup has created employment opportunities for around 10 rural women in   village in   taluk. Since we have started receiving bulk orders, we will employ some more women from surrounding villages. We will be getting infrastructure assistance soon so that we came make this a full-fledged operation.”
 
 The scarves have received positive response in exhibitions held in Belagavi, Hubballi and Dharwad. They will soon be available on e-commerce sites. Their next target is to make scarves for men.
 Vaishnavi and Supriya’s startup was chosen as the Project of the Year, and Vaishnavi the Best Leader at the Yuva Summit 2018.
