BENGALURU: The high court on Wednesday stayed all further proceedings on the FIR registered by   in relation to the   purportedly containing details of the payments made to certain   leaders identified only by their initials. 

 Justice Aravind Kumar passed the order on a petition filed by the director general of income tax (investigation), principal director of investigation and principal commissioner of income tax. The judge also ordered notice to the deputy commissioner of police (Bengaluru east),   K Govindraj, (the complainant) and SHO of   police station.
 
 The I-T department asserted that the diary was seized from his (Govindaraj's) bedroom as per the law in the presence of his wife and other family members when they conducted the raid on March 15, 2016, and that he had not raised any question with the department.
 
 The department said it had confronted several persons with the diary's content s, Govindraj was given a scanned copy and the department had not leaked it to anyone. Petitioners say the notice issued by police to secure the diary appears to be an attempt to hamper the I-T department's probe, adding that the act is politically motivated. 
 
 The department has contended that under Section 293 of the Income Tax Act 1995, there is a clear bar regarding entertainment of civil suits and prosecuting any officer for anything in good faith done or intended to be done under the Act. 
 
 It also claimed that Section 138(2) of the Act bars disclosure of information related to I-T assessees on certain occasions and police have no jurisdiction as per Section 293. Govindaraju had on February 28 filed a complaint about alleged irregularities committed during an I-T search in his house and alleged that no diary was seized. He had said the diary was planted after the I-T raid and leaked to the media.
