UDAIPUR: A commerce stream student from Delhi Public School,  , the 19-year-old genius who stood 4th in the AIR at   2018, had dropped an year and spent hours tto achieve her target. Gunjan is the youngest of three sisters and has no one in the family with a connection to the field, however, she had been determined since school days and dreamt to become full-fledged lawyer. 

 
 The girl who scored 150.25 in the exam was quite confident of finding herself among the top 10, however, she said she is too happy to have secured the 4th rank, which is unexpected. She told TOI, "Law is a very interesting field which involves lot of public speaking. International law attracts me and I want to become a full-time lawyer with no intentions as of now to join the judicial services. Advocacy is a noble profession and a kind of service to community at large, lawyers have too much power to bring about changes in the society." 
 
 Gunjan's father is a jeweller while mother is a nurse. While most of the CLAT aspirants opt to go out for the coaching, Gunjan opted to stay in Udaipur. "I had heard good reviews from my seniors who did well in past years and so I decided to join a coaching institute here. I gave a lot of mock tests, tried to get accurate mock after mock and practised a lot to avoid silly mistakes," she said. 
 
 During the first six months, Gunjan studied some 3-4 hours daily, gradually increased her sittings and around the exam time, her family members would see her locked in for 12 hours at a stretch. Apart from studies, Gunjan likes reading and plays tennis quite well.
