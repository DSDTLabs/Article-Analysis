Jaipur: Rajasthan High Court issued notices to the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) and the Local Bodies Department (DLB) over fire-fighting preparedness in the state. 

 The division bench headed by Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog issued notices on a PIL by lawyer Kunal Rawat in the backdrop of the recent fire incident at a house in Vidhyadhar Nagar which claimed lives of five members of the family. The petition said had the fire-fighting machinery been alert, the damage to life and property could have been averted.
 
 The petition said according to the rules there should be a fire station for every 40,000 population in cities. Accordingly, Jaipur city should have at least 50 fire stations but at present there are only 11stations, which are grossly inadequate. Besides, these fire stations are ill-equipped.
 
 The petition pointed out that according to the building laws, “the maximum permissible height of multi-storey building in Jaipur is 65 metres but the maximum height of a ladder available with the fire-fighting department in Jaipur is 44 metres. If some fire breaks out at a high-rise, JMC has no means to fight it”.
 
 The petition further said a number of posts in fire department are lying vacant and employees are mostly hired on contract basis. They do not possess the necessary equipment and training to react in an emergency situation as was evident in the recent fire tragedy in Vidhyadhar Nagar on January 12. 
 
 The fire brigade could not reach the spot on time and appliances like ladders and water pumps were not in working condition.
 
 The petitioner said there are 51 townships in the state where no fire-fighting facility is available and life and property of the citizens was at great risk at these places. 
 
 He demanded proper policy and guidelines to strengthen the fire-fighting measures.
 
 The notice is returnable within four weeks, said additional advocate general Dharam Veer Tholia, who appeared for DLB.
