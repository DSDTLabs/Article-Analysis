 “Gujarat has done reasonably well in direct selling market and the state has a potential to become a major market for products sold by direct selling companies,” said Vivek Katoch, chairman, IDSA.
 
 According to the report, the Indian direct selling industry has been growing at an annual rate of 8.42% during the past five years. However, the industry is now facing a critical challenge from e-commerce websites which sell direct selling products without its consent.
 
 The direct selling industry in India offers huge opportunities in terms of economic growth, self-employment and women empowerment. The total sales of the industry grew to Rs 10,324.2 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 8,308.5 crores in 2015-16 registering 24% growth in the sales.
