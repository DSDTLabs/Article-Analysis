MOHALI: Taking timely action ahead of monsoon, the   Municipal Corporation has approved works worth Rs 55.5 lakh for cleaning of sewer and storm water lines using super sucker machines.

 The agenda points came up for discussion during the finance and contract committee meeting (F&CC) here on Thursday. A panel comprising Manjit Singh Sethi, mayor  , senior deputy mayor Rishav Jain and two councillors along with MC commissioner   and the members of the F&CC gave a go ahead for the cleaning works in various sectors and phases of the city.
 
 Mayor Kulwant Singh said, “We have cleared works for cleaning of sewer lines using super sucker machines, desilting of storm water drains, repairing and construction of manholes, arranging of generator sets to pump storm water, desilting with suitable capacity sewer jettings and many other such works pertaining to water logging during the rainy season.”
 
 The decision has been taken after experiencing flood-like situation during rains in August last year which had damaged properties and vehicles of Mohali residents.
 
 The Mohali administration identified choked sewer and storm water lines to be the cause of flood-like situation as these disturbed the natural gradient and restricted the flow of water in the city. Many parts of central and north-western Mohali were submerged under five feet of water causing major damage to property and inconvenience to residents. The areas most affected were Phase 2, 3BI, 3BII, 5 and 7.
