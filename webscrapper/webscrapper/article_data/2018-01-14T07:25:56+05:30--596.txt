 The crowd went wild as Agam belted out their popular Carnatic rock numbers 'The Boat Song,' Dhanashree Tillana, Malhar Jam, and Swans of   among others. A jugalbandi of Carnatic beats with contemporary ones also had the audience spellbound. As the evening progressed and the metalcore band took centrestage, the crowd came live as the energy in the air hit a new high. 
 
 Besides music, there was plenty else to see and do on the third day like bike stunts, a martial arts performance (Kalaripayattu), a fashion show and a free style dance competition.

On Sunday, the institute will host 'Popular Night' featuring actor   and his band Farhan Live, with the opening act by   ft. Bennett and the Band.
