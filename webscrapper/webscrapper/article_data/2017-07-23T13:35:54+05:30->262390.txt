Date problems had forced   Chakraborty to back out of Happy Pill. And now, the same calendar seems to have brought him back -but not his own dates though. When Ritwick was approached by Mainak Bhaumick to star in his next after the success of Bibaho Diaries, he had quite a few projects in hand. Mainak then approached   to play the lead. Though the actor wanted to be part of the project, he was faced with another crisis. I hear that his mentor,  , offered him the role of   in the web series that he is producing. Directed by Sayantan Ghoshal, it has   as Satyabati. Mainak then went back to Ritwick as Anirban was not available. Abir, Jisshu, Gaurav and now Anirban, Tolly men's love for Byomkesh is a story in itself.
