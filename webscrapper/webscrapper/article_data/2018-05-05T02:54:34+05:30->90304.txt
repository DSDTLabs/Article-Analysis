NEW DELHI:   on Thursday afternoon   25 of the 500-odd   at   near Tagore Park for   on land belonging to the civic body. An official said that the demolition drive was carried out on court order. The lawyers of the jhuggis dwellers, however, claimed that they hadn’t seen any such court order.

 Dozens of people, including an 11-day-old baby and its mother, were rendered homeless in the scorching heat after the drive. “My baby is unwell,” said the mother, Rajkumari. There was also a 12-year-old girl whose parents claimed that she was suffering from cancer. “My daughter’s health will deteriorate now that we are homeless,” said her mother, Rita.
 
 Many of the affected women work as household helps in the bungalows of Tagore Garden. A group of residents of the colony had moved a local court to get the jhuggis removed. “My household items are buried under the debris because the authorities didn’t give us enough time to vacate our homes,” said Krishna, a household help.
 
 Lawyers of the jhuggi dwellers, quoting a May 3 order of Rohini court, said that the demolition has been stayed. “The court had not given demolition order for any specific property, but the drive was still carried out. We moved an urgent application seeking stay on demolition on Thursday because the jhuggi dwellers were not given an opportunity of hearing. The court stayed the demolition till May 7, the next date of hearing,” said a lawyer.
 
 Timarpur MLA Pankaj Pushkar, who was present during the demolition drive, said, “The court’s order was communicated to the authorities carrying out the demolition, but they still went ahead with the drive. This was an inhumane act and a disaster for the residents, most of whom belong to the SC/ST community. The jhuggi dwellers were not given prior notice to vacate the premises due to which some of them lost their household items.”
