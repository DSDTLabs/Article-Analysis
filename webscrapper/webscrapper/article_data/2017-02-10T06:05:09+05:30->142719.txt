AHMEDABAD: The state   (ACB) strengthened its collaboration with   (GVC) for registering cases and seeking information in  . The first such meeting took place at Gandhinagar where the district-level vigilance officer was apprised of the roles GVC and   can play.

 ACB officials said that the biggest benefit from the collaboration will be to seek information in cases such as disproportionate assets (DA) inquiries, where secrecy is of utmost importance.
 
 Keshav Kumar, special director, ACB, said that Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) works closely with Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) for prevention of corruption. “While the mandate was there in the state as well, we have tried to revitalize the link and seek their support. It will improve the synergy,” he said. Kumar was on deputation to the CBI for six years.
 
 ACB officials said the government of Gujarat has 26 departments. Each department has its own vigilance officer. “Curbing corruption is also their mandate. Thus, on issues such as preventive vigilance inspections (PVI) and investigating specific complaints, ACB can collaborate with them. On the other hand, they can help us when we get complaints of DA, to gather information on specific employees without alarming the suspect,” said an ACB official.
 
 A team of ACB headed by Kumar had made a presentation to the chief vigilance officer of the state last week, after which all collectors and district vigilance committees have been asked to collaborate on vigilance-based issues with ACB. The first meeting took place with Gandhinagar district officials on Thursday.
