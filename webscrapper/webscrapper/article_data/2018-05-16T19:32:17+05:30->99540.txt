 ’ is working its magic big time at the box-office. The Meghna Gulzar’s spy thriller starring   and   in the lead collected Rs 6.10 crore on its fifth day on Tuesday at the box-office, taking its total collection to Rs 45.34 crore.

 
  
 ‘Raazi’ is the film that brought together Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal on the silver screen for the first time. Speaking about working with the actress, Vicky said, “She was really giving as an actor. She has the ability to lift any co-actor’s performance and that is the organic vibe she comes in with. That is really beautiful as a co-actor when you know that your performance is getting enhanced because of that. She is a fantastic human being too.”
 
 Apart from working with each other, working under Meghna Gulzar’s directorial was also a first for the actors. For Alia, working with Meghna was more or less like working with herself. She said, “I have realised this throughout the film and now after the film too that Meghna and I were the same person. The fact that Meghna is such a talented director and a beautiful person gives me the confidence that I am the same person.”
 
 While on the other hand, for Vicky, the warmth and compassion that Meghna provided him on the sets, positioned his mood for the rest of the film. 
 
 “Raazi’ is produced by Vineet Jain, Karan Johar, Hiroo Johar and Apoorva Mehta and co-produced by Priti Shahani.
