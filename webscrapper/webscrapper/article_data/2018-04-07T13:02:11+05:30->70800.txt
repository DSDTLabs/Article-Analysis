LUDHIANA: A 14-year-old girl was   on Thursday by a man who was an accomplice of her friend’s husband, whom the police have arrested. The man had managed to bring the   to his house, saying his wife wanted the girl to accompany her to to see a doctor. When she reached his house, the main accused was already sitting there. When the man’s wife went to the kitchen, he locked her in another room with his friend and accomplice, who raped her. The main accused, however, is still at large.

 In her complaint to the police, the rape survivor’s mother said she had gone to the market for some work on Thursday, while her daughter was alone at home. On returning, she found her daughter missing, and started searching for her. Meanwhile, an hour later, the girl returned home crying. When she was asked what had happened, she narrated the whole incident, after which her mother lodged a police complaint. 
 
 Investigating officer sub-inspector Suresh Kumar said the police had arrested the man — who locked the girl in his room with his friend — for conspiracy, but the main accused who raped her in the room is still at large. The police have been trying to trace him.
