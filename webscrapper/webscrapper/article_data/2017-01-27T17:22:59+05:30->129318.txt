Director   and actor  , who worked together for the comedy thriller   in 2013, is teaming up again for another project this year. 

 Titled  , the movie is a rom-com, but not the typical colourful or dramatic flick, says the director. Asif will be sharing screen with his Thrissivaperoor Kliptham co-star,   yet again.
 Asif plays a youth named Amal, who leads a band set in Kannur. On the movie's plot, the director tells us, 'Under certain circumstances, he is forced to leave the place, and he lands in Kochi, a depressed youth. He lives in a house called Sargapaurnami, which is a Ramji Rao Speaking-style rented building. He finds solace in his roommates, played by Siddique, Dharmajan and Nirmal Palazhi, who show him how to see the occasional setbacks in life as normal.'
 
 The band set is also a very important character in the film, says Jis, who has also scripted the movie. Aparna's character Anu is a strong woman who inspires Amal tremendously, the filmmaker explains. 'Asif also picks up some life lessons from her.' Siddique also plays an important role in the film, named Nakutty. 'He is an associate director in the film industry. The name Nakutty, an acronym of Narayanan Kutty, was given to him by veteran actor Prem Nazir and he is proud that it sounds like Mammotty,' the director reveals.
 
 KPAC Lalitha, Bhagath Manuel, Ramesh Pisharody, Alencier Ley and Sudheer Karamana are the other actors who are part of the cast. Deepak Dev scores music for the film, which has Alex Pulikkal as the cinematographer. The film's main locations are Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Ottapalam and Kannur.
