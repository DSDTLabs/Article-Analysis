JAIPUR: The delay in notifying admissions under the   ( ) Act may result in beneficiary families suffering financial loss as they seek admissions for their wards in  .

 Most of the private schools have completed the admission process and will start the new academic session from April. Beneficiary parents, who are unsure of admissions under the quota, have sought admissions and deposited fees for the seat.
 
 “I am eyeing admission under RTE for the past two years. However, the delay in admission process caused by the government has forced me to apply for admission in a private school. The school gave my son admission with the rider that the fees have to be deposited by March 20. As I am unsure of admissions under RTE, I have deposited the fees,” said  , a roadside vendor living in Adarsh Nagar.
 
 This year there are 2.5 lakh seats available in 33,500 private schools across the state under RTE. The admission process (if it begins in the next few days) will take another three months to be completed in various phases. As many private schools are starting the new session in April, this would mean that 25% students at the entry level will not be able to join classes before July.
 
 “Ideally, admissions under RTE should run parallel with that of private schools. The gap in classes would ultimately affect students under the quota,” said  , a social activists working for RTE admissions. Sources said that the delay was due to the government coming up with new rules for RTE admissions.
 
 Meanwhile, the state education department has made the admission under the Act strict by downwardly revising the income limit from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 1.25 lakh. The notification for admissions to 2.5 lakh seats under RTE will come on April 1.
