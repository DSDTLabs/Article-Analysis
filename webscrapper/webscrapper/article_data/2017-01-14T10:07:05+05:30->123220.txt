Single girls will not be allowed to enter into college premises. They'll have to show a recent picture with their boyfriend. Spread love."
 
 What seemed like a joke on WhatsApp escalated and threatened to taint the reputation of the college, prompting the college management to approach police. In a letter to Kengeri police, the college authorities wrote: "Some miscreants have created false notice and spread the message in social media ...we have already circulated an appeal to all departments, to inform the students to refrain themselves from such activities.

 MN Anucheth, DCP-West, said the police would take the letter as a petition and look into the case.
 
 “There has been no such notice put up on any board in our college. We have no idea who has done this and why it's going viral on WhatsApp. We are on the lookout for whoever has tried to defame the institution and lodged a complaint with Kengeri police as well," Prof KN Subramanya, principal, RV College of Engineering, told TOI.
