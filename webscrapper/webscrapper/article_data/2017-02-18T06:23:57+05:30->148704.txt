LUCKNOW: Chief minister   on Friday urged voters in Bakshi Ka Talab (BKT) constituency to vote for the   even if they are angry with the party's sitting MLA  .

 “I apologise for the mistakes done by the MLA. But remember, if you vote against him, it will be against me as well. So, if you want to see Akhilesh Yadav as chief minister, vote for the Samajwadi Party ,“ Akhilesh said while addressing an election meeting in BKT.
 
 SP faces a tough contest in BKT in wake of reports of anti-incumbency against Gomti Yadav and the damage caused by rebel SP leader Rajendra Prasad Yadav, who is contesting on RLD ticket. Akhilesh assured that if SP return to power then he will sent a nominee from BKT to the legislative council to boost development of the area. Responding to BJP's charge of goonda raj in UP during SP rule, Akhilesh said how will they provide security to people in UP when they have not been able to protect country's border from terrorists. Reacting to Modi's remarks that he is adopted son of UP, Akhilesh said, “If UP has adopted him, then who are we?” Attacking Centre's demonetisation move, Akhilesh said Modi has still not informed the country how much black money has been recovered so far.
 
 “Several died while standing in queue after demonetisation but the Central government did nothing for them, whereas the SP government gave Rs 2 lakh to the families of the victims. A pregnant woman in Kanpur who was forced to stand in queue delivered a baby boy. People named him khazanchi (cashier). We gave the family Rs 2 lakh be cause the family belongs to weaker section,” he said.
 
 The SP chief described poll pact with the Congress as an alliance between two youths who will collectively work for the development of the state.
