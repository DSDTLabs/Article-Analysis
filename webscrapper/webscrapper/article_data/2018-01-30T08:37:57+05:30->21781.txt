RAJKOT: A family of three — a woman, her   and their daughter — was dragged out of their house and thrashed in   on   in Rajkot on Sunday night. 

 Shamim Kapasi (53) and her daughter Farida (23) were dragged out of their house by seven unidentified assailants which included three women led by Nishant Theba and Jasmin Mamati, residents of the same area. When the women were being   up by the accused who had pulled up their hair and dragged them on to the road, Shamim’s husband Abbas (55) tried to intervene. 
 
 “Incensed at this, the accused beat up Abbas also. The reason for the crime is trivial. The Kapasis was going to a restaurant for dinner on Kalavad highway when at Motamavagam, the accused waylaid them and picked up a fight, asking why they were staring at them,” said a Gandhigram police official. 
 
 “However, as passers-by intervened and helped reach a compromise. However, when the Kapasi family returned home at night, the accused barged into their house and attacked them,” the official added.
