PUNE: The countdown to the agreement between the   and six states on the   (ESAs) declaration in the Western Ghats has begun. 

 Conservationists have alleged that local politicians are not only opposing the plan by misinforming villagers but are also involved in illegal developments within the protected areas.
 
  of Devrai Foundation said local politicians, including the sarpanch and his deputy, were found to have been involved directly in illegal development projects near the Tamhini wildlife sanctuary.
 
 “They are directly involved in these projects and stand to benefit. Hence, they comply with developers and are trying to oppose the ESA policy,” he said.
 
 When such projects come up, villagers are more than happy to find employment and ignore the fact that their work is harmful to the environment. They are misled by local politicians, he said.
 
 Nearly 57,000sqkm of the Western Ghats area will be declared as ESAs. Of it, 17,340sqkm is in Maharashtra.
