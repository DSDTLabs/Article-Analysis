 Last week, a three-member special SC bench headed by justice   heard the case. While two judges of a five-member bench had recommended disqualification of Sharif in their April 20 judgment, three judges had recommended formation of joint investigation team to probe the charges.

 The original five-member bench, which had heard the case before the formation of the JIT, will issue the final verdict.
