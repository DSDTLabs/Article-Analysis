CHANDIGARH: A meeting of Joint Action Committee (JAC) was held to discuss the negative aspect of a survey for which the   department has roped in many government school teachers.

 The education department has not issued any   to apprise the people of Chandigarh of such a survey. Hence, the teachers are facing a number of difficulties while approaching people’s houses for the survey. People are not opening their doors and are often mistaking the teachers for salesmen and misbehaving with them, the members of JAC said.
 
 In a recent incident, a stray dog bit a teacher of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 40 when she was out for the survey. She had to purchase all the medicines amounting to more than Rs 25,000 on her own. This has further agitated the teachers.
 
 “This type of work hampers the studies of students as teachers are busy in conducting the survey and compiling the data collected,” added the president of  .
 
 In a joint statement issued by the leaders of JAC including Savinder Singh, Bhag Singh Kairon, Khushali Ram Sharma, Ranbir Singh Rana, Japinder Kaur and  , they appealed the UT education department to conduct such type of survey by outsourcing people and involving part-time employees to avoid the loss of studies of the students and also the harassment to the teachers. They have also requested the department to give public notice in the newspapers to make common people aware of such activities.
