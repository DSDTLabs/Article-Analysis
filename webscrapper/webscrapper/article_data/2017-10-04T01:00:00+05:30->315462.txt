Armed with paint brushes and cans, this bunch of students were a busy lot when we spotted them inside the   department building at  , recently. While we were just about to leave the building after organising an audition there, we were quite curious to know what they were up to. When asked, one of the girls,  , who was part of the group, painting the building wall, she said, “Each year, the walls of the building are redone by the second-year students. And it’s redone based on different themes. This year, we chose a theme that shows the architectural transition over the years. See, I am painting the famous Meenakshi Temple, which portrays the architectural style of olden times.” So, do they choose only architectural themes? “Not really. In some classes, we’ve walls done using film  , graphics, etc. And each year, the theme keeps changing,” she replied and continued, “This is not part of our curriculum and therefore, it is so much fun. It’s such a good learning experience for us architectural students. I actually painted only a small portion of the Meenakshi Temple, but it made me realise the amount of architectural intricacies that have gone into building that structure.”
