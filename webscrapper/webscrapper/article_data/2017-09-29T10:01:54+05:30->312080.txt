NEW DELHI: Congress vice president   said PM   and the Philippines's Rodrigo Duterte are vey alike in that they both "thrive on hatred and disrespect institutions".

  In an interview carried in The Huffington Post this week, Rahul also said socially and economically, Modi "is a status-quoist pretending to be a reformer". He added that the decision to demonetise was not just "a body blow to our economy", it is also a "superb example" of this disrespect for institutions, because it was "taken unilaterally" by PM Modi. Still,   came to power democratically, and for that to happen, Modi followed "the model of the Muslim Brotherhood [in Egypt]". 
 
 The Congress vice president said Modi and the government are exploiting the supposed anger over unemployment to use it "against minorities". That, combined with "institutional civil war", has led to a "crisis" for Indian democracy, said the Congress vice president.
 
  "It is this combination of circumstances that has created the space for leaders like Modi and Duterte who thrive on hatred and disrespect institutions," said Rahul in his interview with Nicolas Berggruen, the chairman of a US think tank, Berggruen Institute.
 
  Modi's record in job-creation is "disastrous" and the resultant economic insecurity is "being aggressively exploited by the right-wing", said Rahul.
 
  "His administration is taking the anger of the youth and diverting it against minorities. That is what most right-wing leaders do - this bait-and-switch is not dissimilar from what the right-wing are doing all over the world," said Rahul.
 
  The weapon being used is "hate", and it is being sued by the   and the  , said Rahul.
 
  "They are creating massive fault lines by isolating millions of our people. Tribals, Dalits and Muslims are simply being told by the ruling party that they cannot be part of India's vision. Journalists are being shot dead," said Rahul.
