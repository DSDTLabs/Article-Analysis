CHENNAI:   should have asked for an all-time exemption from   (NEET), not a one-time reprieve, said retired judge   on Monday. Addressing a seminar on NEET, he said the state had taken a U-turn on its   to be excluded from NEET.

 “When did the demand become a one-year exemption? The state should have sought total exemption from the medical entrance exam, and should have asked to continue with its own system of merit-based admissions,” he said.
 
 The retired Madras high court judge recalled the older system of Common Entrance Test, which was followed until 2006 in the state for admission to medical seats, and added that the whole point of the shift to merit-based counselling in 2007 was because Tamil Nadu which had a large number of medical aspirants would lose out in the older evaluation system. 
 
 While commending the recent move by the state to introduce board exams for Class XI, he said a “comprehensive education system” is what the state should be moving towards, and NEET is not the way to go about it. 
 
 “A ranking system is not necessary,” he said, attacking NEET’s examination pattern which follows a filtration system based on cut-off marks and allows students based on their national ranking to secure seats in private and public medical colleges. 
 
 He called for strengthening the school education syllabus, instead of ditching it altogether to bring in an entrance exam.
 
 “Public examinations come under the purview of a state. Legally, it is well within Tamil Nadu's power to decide if it wants to be part of NEET or be exempted from the same,” added Hariparanthaman.
