GURUGRAM: The city is likely to receive some rainfall next week leading to a marginal dip in the mercury. 

 A fresh western disturbance is set to make headway into the region, increasing chances of precipitation in Gurugram, Faridabad and other parts of NCR between March 21 evening and March 22 morning, said an official from the Regional Meteorological Centre. 
 
 Met officials said though rain eluded the city earlier this week when a western disturbance triggered showers in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and a few places in Punjab and Haryana, the advent of a new weather system might result in light rain across NCR around the middle of next week. They claimed parts of Punjab and northern Haryana might also receive moderate rainfall.
 
 According to the sources, mercury is expected to rise temporarily over the next few days before it rains around March 21-22, extending the pleasant weather conditions till around March-end. “As is the case with every western disturbance, we would see a sharp upward movement in the mercury over the few days. Last Thursday, the maximum temperature was 31 degrees Celsius, which came down to 29 degrees Celsius on Saturday following the western disturbance earlier this week. Again, the temperature is likely to go up to 34 degrees Celsius till March 21. After that, the mercury will come down to a pleasant level again,” explained another Met official. The maximum temperature will be 33 degrees Celsius on Sunday. 
 
 Officials also said moderate wind movements over the last few days had kept the weather pleasant in the city and its neighbouring areas. However, the temperature is likely to rise above 35-degree mark around the end of March.
