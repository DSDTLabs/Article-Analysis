 BCCI has been paying 10 per cent of an overseas player's annual fee to his home board from the beginning of the IPL.
 
 
 
 "We have made a provision whoever (whichever Board) provides players for the entire duration, we will pay the Board 20 per cent," Shukla said.

 On match timings, Shukla said a couple of owners have objected  's proposal to start weekend games at 5.30 p.m. and 7 p.m.
 
 "The broadcaster had requested and the GC considered the request during its meeting. After that we have received objections from a couple of franchises. We will discuss with them also. We will discuss with the broadcaster too and arrive at a decision in an amicable way," he said.
 
 It has also been learnt that uncapped players might go under the hammer early this time.
