HYDERABAD: The opposition’s efforts to forge a coalition of anti-BJP forces received a shot in the arm with   being reelected as   general secretary for a second term.

 
 
 Emerging, perhaps, as the true inheritor of Harkishan Singh Surjeet’s legacy, Yechury, with his cross-party acceptance as mediator, is now poised to play the role his mentor did in the 1996 and 2004 general elections.
 
 In 1996, and again in 2003-04, Surjeet had worked as the key negotiator to bring together disparate regional forces to form the United Front government, and then the UPA-I government, to prevent   from coming to power.
 
 Yechury, much like Surjeet, has been at the forefront of efforts to forge an alliance of like-minded secular, democratic forces and has been a strong critic of BJP-RSS and communal forces. 
 
 Following Surjeet’s footsteps, Yechury is seen as one of the most acceptable mediators cutting across parties, and most recently, he was among the key mechanics of the removal motion against CJI  .
 
 Persistently pushing for an “understanding” with   if the Left was to succeed in its ultimate aim to defeat “communal and fascistic forces”, Yechury, soon after his re-election, said, “We are embarking on a new course of intensified struggle in defence of our country and in the interest of our people, to change India for the better.
 
 Our main task today is to defeat the BJP-led government. All necessary measures are being undertaken as decided by the party congress.”
 
 While the CPM leader clarified that electoral tactics would be worked out by states individually and on the basis of ground realities, he added, “We will have no political alliance with Congress. But we will have an understanding with it inside and outside ( ) to stop communalism.”
