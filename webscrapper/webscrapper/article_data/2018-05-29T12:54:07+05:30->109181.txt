Sarbajeet Das-directed act 
 is back on stage. Scheduled to take place at Yours Truly   on June 2 and at The Circular Square on June 3, the play features artistes Faria Fatma, Utkarsh Gaharwar, Nirlek Dhulla, Debanjana Nath, Hetal Shah and Ankita Jain.

  The plot revolves around  , a middle-aged working woman who is dissatisfied with her circumstances. There are many factors for this upsurge. Savitri, who is educated enough, takes up a job and becomes the financial controller of the household. The job brings her into contact with men who are dynamic, smart and rich. She starts finding faults with her unemployed husband Mahendra, who in the state of extreme depression fails to gratify even the biological urge of his wife. Her attitude towards her husband also has an adverse effect on her children. They, too, start ignoring their father and treat him as a useless item of furniture which somehow cannot be thrown out. The play continues to oscillate between Mahendra and Savitri. 
 
  Playwright   has attempted to describe and dramatise the socio-economic situation of a middle-class family, which is caught in the web of financial setbacks which render the head of the family almost incapacitated to do anything. In the beginning, we do sympathise with Savitri, the way she works hard to manage the family, but the latter half of the play reveals the other side of Savitri and our sympathies change, Savitri falls in our estimation. She seeks to fulfil herself in relationships outside marriage, only to realize that men are the same beneath different faces.
