PUNE: Just chill. It is as   as it gets in Pune and the temperature will plummet further in the coming days, the weatherman warns. 

 The city recorded the lowest temperature of the   on Thursday. 
 
 The previously recorded lowest temperature was 8.4C on December 10. Saturday is expected to be colder with the temperature hovering around 7C.
 
 “India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that temperatures will drop this week. Now after tomorrow there will be a slight increase in temperature to 9C, but then again it will drop. For the coming few days, the temperature will remain below normal,” said A K  , a senior scientist at IMD.
 
 Another reason for the low minimum temperature is the clear sky which will prevail in the coming days. “If the sky remains clear, the minimum temperature remains low. But due to lack of clouds, the sunlight is harsh so there will not be much of a dip in the maximum temperature,” explained Srivastava.
 
 Stating the reasons for the dip in the temperature in the entire country, Srivastava said one of the main reasons was heavy snow in the Siberian region. “Northerly winds are one of the major factors but it is not just the cold winds from Himalaya but winds from Siberia which also affect our weather. All this is causing the chill here,” added Srivatsava.
