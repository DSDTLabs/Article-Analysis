LONDON: An Indian-origin businessman who had pleaded guilty to the theft of a sports car last November was spared jail on Tuesday and ordered to complete 100 hours of community service.

 Umair Bhatti, who ran a vehicle storage firm in the UK, took the black   from an underground car park near the London Eye tourist attraction of the British capital and sold it to pay off his debts.
 
 The 30-year-old, who was out on bail, was handed a six-month prison sentence for the theft but the sentence has been suspended for two years - which means he will be spared any jail time unless he re-offends.
 
 "It was not the product of a momentary temptation, it was a planned and concerted theft committed because you were in debt. I am not satisfied remorse is great, but I accept you will have learned some lessons from this experience," judge Christopher Jeans said at Inner London Crown Court today.
 
 According to Evening Standard, the judge took note of the fact that Bhatti was the main breadwinner for his family and has a younger brother who has been recently diagnosed with a debilitating illness.
 
 The car had been left by its owner, businessman  , at Bhatti's airport meet-and-greet firm Garaged.com.
 
 Bhatti, a self-confessed 'petrolhead', rented out parking spaces in the car park as the owner of Garaged.com and was employed by Khan while the businessman was out of the country.
 
 After Bhatti applied to register a change of ownership of the Porsche, Khan received a letter informing him of the changes.
 
 Khan returned to the UK briefly to move the car to another part of the car park and alert the authorities but Bhatti took off his handwritten note and had the car towed away instead.
 
 After his arrest, Bhatti initially claimed he had bought the car from Khan for 20,000 pounds, then admitted he had been under pressure to pay off debts for building work.
 
 A charge of fraud by false representation was dropped and the court had admitted the theft charge.
