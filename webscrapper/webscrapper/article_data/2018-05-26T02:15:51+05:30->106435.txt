MUMBAI:   — the lender with the highest percentage of bad loans — has reported a net loss of Rs 5,662 crore for the quarter ended March 2018 against a loss of Rs 3,199 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The losses widened as the bank made additional provisions of Rs 10,773 crore for the quarter ended March 2018, partly because of a new RBI circular that scrapped all loan-restructuring schemes.

 
  — the third largest public sector lender — also reported a net loss of Rs 3,102 crore for Q4FY18 as against a net profit of Rs 155 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, again due to bad loan provisions. Adding these two results to the earnings of the 15 banks already reported, the total losses of lenders have now grown to Rs 53,005 crore. 
 
 Three more lenders — Bank of India, United Bank and   — are yet to announce results.
 
 IDBI Bank is responding to the loss by selling non-core assets such as stakes in its mutual fund and life insurance companies. 
 
 It also plans to shut down a few branches and ATMs that are not profitable. 
 
 Announcing the results, the bank’s MD & CEO M K Jain said that the lender would hire vertical heads for information technology, human relations and treasury from the private sector. He said that the bank also plans to sell non-performing assets worth Rs 21,000 crore. The bank’s gross NPA soared to 27.95% of its loans at end-March 2018 compared to 21.25% at the end of March 2017. IDBI Bank said that it continued to have loans worth Rs 14,000 crore under watch for stress.
 
 Announcing the results on Friday, Bank of Baroda MD & CEO P S Jayakumar said that following the provisioning, among the standard loans, at the most Rs 10,000 crore would be under stress and there have been no delinquency in the loans advanced since 2015. “Going forward, growth will be good and there has been a dramatic improvement in the quality of assets. The infrastructure that we have invested in will result in 20% growth in coming quarters,” said Jayakumar.
