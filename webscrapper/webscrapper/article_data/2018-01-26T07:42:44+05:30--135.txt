CHENNAI: Freedom fighters’   is not a charity, but conferment of honour on a selfless fighter, the   said while censuring the   government for denying such benefit for the past 37 years to an octogenarian and former member of the Indian National Army (INA).

 V Gandhi, 89, joined the INA in Rangoon, Burma. He worked for its propaganda department and played “a very significant role”. Gandhi was arrested and jailed in Burma from May 1945 to December 1945 by the British. Though these facts were endorsed by Captain Lakshmi (Lakshmi Sahgal), the Tamil Nadu government refused to provide him the benefit of the pension since 1980.
 
 Appalled at the manner in which such freedom fighters were handled by the authorities, Justice K Ravichandrabaabu said, “Sorry sir, you are made to suffer at the hands of our people too, as, unfortunately, this is how the bureaucratic dogmatism with wooden approach works, at times, in this country, for which you fought to get freedom.”
 
 The judge said he was unable to comprehend the reasoning of the authorities concerned for rejecting the claim of the petitioner. When the factual aspect of the matter was vouched by a co-prisoner and personally acknowledged by the “great personality Col Lakshmi Sahgal”, there cannot be even a little doubt in the mind of the authorities about the bona fide of the petitioner, the court said.
 
 The authorities themselves had admitted the issuance and receipt of those two certificates, the court said. Despite the availability of those two overwhelming evidence, it is very unfortunate that they had chosen to mechanically reject the petitioner’s claim with irrelevant and immaterial reason, which only showed that they had, somehow, wanted to wash off their hands and relieve themselves of their liability, the court added and directed the   to provide the benefit within two weeks including the arrears from 1980.
