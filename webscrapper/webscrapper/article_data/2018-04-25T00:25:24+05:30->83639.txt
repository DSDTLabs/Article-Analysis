Jaipur: Rajasthan High Court has ordered status quo over allotment of a piece of land in the name of BJP for building its party office at throw away price in Sirohi which prima facie belonged to the PWD department.

 It issued notice to the principal secretaries of local bodies, PWD, Sirohi district collector and commissioner Sirohi municipal council. The notice is returnable within three weeks. 
 
 The single bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta order followed a petition by Ishwar Singh Dabi, a Congress counsellor seeking to quash the order of the PWD transferring the land in the name of the ruling party.
 
 The petitioner said land measuring 0.28 hectares was portrayed as Banjar land in Khasra No.2709, whereas the land was owned by the Public Works Department of the State Government and was valued at Rs 50 crore, as per the letter dated January 19, 2017 issued by the office of the district collector, Sirohi.
 
 The land in question was owned by the Public Works Department, which initially expressed its requirement for the same. The Sirohi district collector opined that the land could be transferred only after it is vested with the municipal council, Sirohi. 
 
 The municipal council invited objections regarding change of land use/allotment of land and the petitioner as well as numerous other persons filed their objections against the proposed allotment, but without considering the objections, sanction was accorded for issuance of the patta of the disputed land in favour of BJP by the municipal council purportedly under the state grants Act, whereas, as per the petitioner (who objected to the allotment), the municipal body has no powers to allot any land under the said statute and the allotment, if any, could only be made by auction under the Rajasthan Municipalities (Disposal of Urban Land) Rules, 1974.
 
 The petitioner claimed that in this clandestine and high-handed manner, the ruling party have alienated valuable government land at throwaway price and that the allotment in question amounts to gross abuse of powers and fraud.
