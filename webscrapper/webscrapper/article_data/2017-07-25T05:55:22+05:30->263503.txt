JAIPUR: As per the rules of abseil or urban rappelling, there should be no crowd on the rooftop and even if there is one, it is mandatory to rope them up as a safety measure. When someone is going down the rope it is a natural tendency for others to look at the descent. The accident occurred only because the girls on the roof were not safely roped up.

 Moreover, it is very risky to do this in monsoon and students should not have been standing on the rooftop. I donâ€™t understand why rappelling was being done without jummar (safety equipment).
 
 In Jaipur, this is being done in very well-known schools and without properly certified people. No organization or coach in Jaipur is affiliated to the Indian   ( ), New Delhi, and they are not technically trained by the ministry of defence, government of India mountaineering institutes. The schools/colleges are playing with the life of students and this should be totally banned.
 
 As per GOI and mountaineering rules, all equipment used for the sport are the lifeline of mountaineers/adventurers and rock climbers or rappellers. Equipment is only available in   and   and the quality of one used in Jaipur should be certified and tested for strength and endurance from laboratories.
