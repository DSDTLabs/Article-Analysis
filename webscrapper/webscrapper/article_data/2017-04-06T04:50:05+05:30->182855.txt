NEW DELHI: The   government will launch a centralised grievance redressal number to address all government and corporation-related issues if the party wins the civic polls, chief minister Arvind   said at a rally in   on Wednesday. The CM said he “will lock all municipal inspectors in rooms indulging in corruption“.

 Kejriwal alleged that country's big electricity companies have ganged up against AAP government. “They have approached   for help. BJP will increase electricity cost if BJP comes to power in the MCDs,“ he said appealing people to vote for AAP in civic polls. He promised that by May 7 he will clear land pooling policy which is pending for long.
 
 Urging voters to vote for the AAP in civic polls, he said, “The MLAs belong to the AAP. If you have councillors from the same party then it will help in better coordination and there will not be any fight. “With this, we can launch one phone number for all that can address the problems ranging from sanitation and garbage to ration card.“
