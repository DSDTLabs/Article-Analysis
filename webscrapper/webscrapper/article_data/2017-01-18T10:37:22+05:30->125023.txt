The male elephant returned to the reserve forest.
 
 Palanisamy disconnected the power supply and went absconding. The incident came to light on Tuesday morning. Mettupalayam forest range officer M Nazir and forest department staff rushed to the spot. They rescued the injured calf and took it to the forest department’s timber depot in Mettupalayam where it was given treatment.
 
 District forest officer S Ramasubramanian held inquiries with the farmers.   and police officials also visited the spot. A team of veterinary doctors conducted a postmortem at the spot and the carcasses were buried near the farmland.
 
 Mettupalayam forest range officer Nazir has registered a case against Palanisamy under section 9 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972.
