Supermodel   said she detests comparisons with her elder sister   and insists despite being in the same profession they have different styles. 
The 20-year-old   says they hate the competitive vibe and are best friends. 
 
  
  
 "People compare us as though there's not enough room for both of us. Everyone has their own path, we're both modelling but we have really different looks. 
 
 "We hate being competitive with each other because, apart from my mom, she's my best friend. When people compare you all the time, it makes you start doing it too,"   said. 
 
 She adds if they were not sisters, "nobody would compare us at all".
