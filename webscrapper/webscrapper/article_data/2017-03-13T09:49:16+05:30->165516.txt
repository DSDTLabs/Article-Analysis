Howevever, the news is that the Mollywood cameraman has opted out of the Tamil movie to collaborate with Rohit Shetty’s Ajay Devgn-starrer  .

 Jomon took to his social networking page to share the news. “Honoured to announce my new project, Golmaal, with  ,Ajay Devgan,Parineethi Chopra & Tabu. But good things come with a price and so this time I will not be able to work with Gautham Sir (#Druvanachathiram)and be part of the rest of the journey with him despite trying to adjust dates and accommodate both, as Golmaal was committed much before. But I feel blessed for getting the opportunity to work with such passionate directors,” he wrote.
 
 Jomon would also turn a producer this year with a Nivin Pauly movie, which is being directed by Major Ravi. He will also be cranking the camera for the love story.
