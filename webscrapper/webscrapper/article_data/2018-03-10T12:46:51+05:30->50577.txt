PANAJI: If the state government had refused to bow down to the   operators demands during the strike called by them in January, they would have backed down, GTDC chairman Nilesh Cabral, said on Friday. “Let me put it in the right perspective. If we had to hold out for another two to three days, I think they would have fallen in line themselves,”   said. “However, as the government, we have to adhere to all the MLAs wishes.” Calangute   MLA Michael   had brokered peace between the agitating taxi operators and the state government. 

 Initially, chief minister Manohar   had adopted a stern stance and had warned taxi operators that they could lose their licence if they failed to comply with the government order on speed governors or if they resorted to violence.
 
 Tourist taxi operators in Goa had gone on a three-day strike from January 19. Around 17,000 taxis had stayed off the roads after the government refused to exempt taxis from installing speed governors.
 
 Cabral said that the tendency to overcharge and the harassment by taxi operators would lead to “killing of the golden goose” of tourism.
 
 The Curchorem MLA said the state government shelved its plans to introduce new taxi services from March 1 due to apprehensions of protests from the taxi lobby.
 
 “From March 1 we wanted to start the new service. Unfortunately, the chief minister is not there. Because what happens is that when you start something new you will have a law and order problem. And he has not delegated his powers to anyone else. So we have delayed it till the chief minister comes,” Cabral said.
 
 After the January 19 strike, Cabral had proposed the idea of starting an app-based taxi service in Goa, which would monitor any illegal conduct by taxi drivers.
 
 “Ultimately, it is the government’s responsibility to put all establishments in place,” Cabral said.
