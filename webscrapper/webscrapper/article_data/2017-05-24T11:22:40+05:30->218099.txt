NAGPUR: Alleging that farmers, labourers and micro industries have been adversely affected by the establishment of prime minister’s   (Mudra) Yojana, Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti (VRAS) announced it will organize a public agitation at   on Friday.

 In a press conference held at   on Tuesday, chief coordinator of the samiti Ram Neole said, “More people working in small scale industries have lost their jobs because of Mudra and such businesses had shut their doors.”
 
 A recent mandate from the RBI instructing banks to levy various services charges on customers including penalties for not keeping minimum account balance is another issue the samiti will be challenging in the agitation.
 
 According to Neole, the government is forcing cashless transactions on the people after demonetisaton without implementing a proper digital infrastructure. “If a farmer is asked to do most of his business transactions digitally, he won’t be able to do so because he is not familiar with the system,” he said.
 
 Neole also alleged that ATMs in the country are still out of cash months after demonetisation.
