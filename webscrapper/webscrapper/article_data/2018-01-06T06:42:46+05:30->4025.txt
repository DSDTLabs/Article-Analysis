HOWRAH: Two-decade-old Binodini Girls' School in   was suddenly closed down on Friday, leaving 300-odd students in shock. 

 The students reached the school as usual in the morning, only to find headmistress   standing behind the closed gate and telling them to return. "Go home. The school has shut down. Get yourselves admitted to some other school," she reportedly said.
 
 The authorities of the Hindi-medium government-sponsored institution didn't bother to inform the government,   or the guardians.
 
 The girls allegedly started throwing stones at the gate.
 
 Asked what led to this decision, the headmistress said, "The school doesn't have a building of its own. It belongs to another school. There is a long-standing dispute between the two school authorities.
 
 Howrah district inspector of schools said, "I am surprised to hear the school has shut down. We didn't know anything about it. I'll call a meeting of heads of both institutions housed in that building. I'll visit the building on Monday and get the school reopened."
