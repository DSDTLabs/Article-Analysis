Bengaluru: Officials of the hostel of Maharani’s Arts, Commerce and Management College for Women, Seshadri Road, filed a police complaint on Monday, saying an unidentified person was frequently entering the hostel premises at night and wearing innerwear of students kept for drying.

 Hostel officials handed over to police CCTV footage of February 12, which shows him entering the premises nude at the dead of night and wearing the clothes of students. At one point of time, a security guard is seen chasing him but the man escapes.
 
 Principal R Shantakumari told media that the person was seen often but not at regular intervals. “Our girls have seen him jumping from the compound wall and enter the hostel. A few months ago, all the girls had screamed on seeing him and he ran away. There was no news of him since then. All of a sudden, he was spotted in February,” she said.
 
 A student said he had stolen at least a dozen of their innerwear. 
 
 High Grounds police suspected him to be from the same area, Gandhinagar, and were confident of arresting him soon.
