COIMBATORE:   spent 22% more money on   ( )-related activities in 2015-16 (fiscal 2016) with bulk of the money going into education, skills development, healthcare and sanitation initiatives. 

 In absolute terms, the total money spent rose by Rs 2,500 crore to Rs 8,300 crore in fiscal 2016, data compiled by ratings agency Crisil showed.
 
 The   Act, 2013, encourages corporates to spend at least 2% of their average net profit of the past three years on CSR activities. In the second year of the CSR mandate, 1,505 companies, or 30% of the 4,887 firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, met the criteria for mandatory spending.
 
 Of these, 77%, or 1158 companies, reported on their CSR activity, compared with 1,024 companies, or 75% of the nearly 1,300 eligible in fiscal 2015. These 1,158 companies also spent a lot more money compared with fiscal 2015, which led to a 29 basis points (0.29%) improvement in average spending to 1.64% compared with 1.35% in fiscal 2015, moving closer to the 2% mandate.
 
 Another Rs 1,835 crore needed to be spent for the average to achieve the mandated 2%. Of this, as much as Rs 5,300 crore – or Rs 1,175 crore more than fiscal 2015 -- were spent on CSR activities linked to education, skills development, healthcare and sanitation, which are also the government’s priority areas. 
 
 “A standout feature last fiscal was about focus shifting to CSR outcomes,” said Ashu Suyash, managing director and CEO, Crisil. 
 
 “This is indeed the way to go, as underlined by the ‘Effective Altruism’ movement worldwide where, instead of doing what feels right, find the best causes to work on by using empirical evidence and analysis.”
 
 There were 133 companies that either didn’t spend a dime, or were still freezing their CSR agenda. But even that is an improvement given that 200 companies were in the same boat in fiscal 2015. Of the 1,024 companies that figured in Crisil’s analysis last year, 917 continued to meet the CSR criteria in 2016.
 
 Nearly two-thirds of them increased their CSR spend, while one-third reduced. Encouragingly, 56% of them spent 2% or more compared with 50% in fiscal 2015. 
 
 In fiscal 2015, smaller companies spent relatively more, but in fiscal 2016, the larger ones have done well with more than half of them adhering to the 2% mandate versus approximately a third previously.
 
 “There were two reasons for the 22 percentage point jump in adherence by the larger companies: one, they are overcoming the challenge of large-scale interventions, which takes more time and effort. And two, they are using implementing agencies, mainly non-governmental organisations, for execution,” Crisil stated.
