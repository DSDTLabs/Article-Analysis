After a flurry of activities over three days at the  , models and designers got together to unwind at the after-party. Though the three days were about crazy schedules and back-to-back shows, the partying spirit was still high as the attendees took some time off to relax, chat or shake a leg on the dance floor. "This has surely been one good show. The best part was that it was lot of fun doing the shows here as each was choreographed in a different way â€“ in some we were supposed to dance on the ramp, in others we had to be a little playful and quite bold in a few. We also had a lot of fun backstage, to keep ourselves energised we used to dance in between shows," said  , Miss Asia Pacific World 2013, who walked the ramp for various shows.
