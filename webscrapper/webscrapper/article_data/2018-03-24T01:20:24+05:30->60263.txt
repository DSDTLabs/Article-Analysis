MUMBAI: Contradicting Union finance minister Arun Jaitley’s statement, CM   on Friday said that an   ( ) will be set up in Mumbai at any cost and that only Mumbai can be home to such a hub in India. 

 Jaitley, in his Parliament speech, had said the first IFSC will come up in Gujarat, and unless it’s optimally used, there won’t be another such centre.   MLC Sanjay Dutt, referring to Jaitley’s speech, raised the issue through a calling attention motion in the legislative council. 
 
 Clarifying, Fadnavis said IFSC will come up in Mumbai and the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train’s base too would be in BKC. “I want to make it clear, by apologizing to all, that a financial services hub cannot be built in any other city and this is 100% right,” he said.
 
 “We have two models of IFSC. One is on the lines of London wherein it will not have an SEZ tag and will lead to losing tax concessions from the Centre. The other is to establish an IFSC subsection in an existing SEZ . For both, we don’t need to go to the Centre,” the CM said. 
 
 He said, “Later, the Union finance minister during a media interview said that Mumbai can be considered for an IFSC because as it’s a natural financial hub.”
