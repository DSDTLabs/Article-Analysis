AGRA: Expressing strong objection to chief minister  's remarks that priests in Mathura were bringing a bad name to the state by “extorting” tourists, priests of the holy town burnt an effigy of the CM and swore to boycott the   in the 2019   polls. Addressing newsmen, the priests said the CM had defamed them by making such remarks. "We have families to feed and we work hard for it,” they said adding that the BJP would have to pay for the CM’s “arrogance”.
 
  “This is our family business and we have been doing it for generations. Now Yogiji wants to ban it,” said  , a priest. He dismissed the charge that they fleeced tourists and claimed that all of them do their work honestly.
  
  Another priest,  , said that Yogi’s statement about banning ‘pandas’ in Mathura was not acceptable. “We have been doing this for ages and this is our livelihood. How can he take it away?” he said.
  
  The angry priests threatened to launch an agitation if the CM failed to withdraw his statement.
  
  Social worker Tarachand Goswami wondered how   who himself was an ascetic, could give such a statement. “We are Brahmins and we voted this party to power and this is how they treat us," he said, adding that the CM should apologise for his statement and wondered why Yogi had singled out Mathura pandas and said nothing about those in Varanasi and other cities.
  
  According to local administration officials, there have been frequent reports of pandas extorting money from pilgrims in the name of seeking donations. Officials claimed that there have been instances where pandas have harassed tourists in case their demand for 'dakshina' was not agreed to.
