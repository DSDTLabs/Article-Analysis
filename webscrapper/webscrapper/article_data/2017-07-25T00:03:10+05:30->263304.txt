Madurai: A “ wall of kindness” enabling the people to donate clothes and other essential things to the needy was inaugurated at the Tirunelveli collectorate premises by district collector Sandeep Nanduri on Monday. Speaking on the occasion, the district collector said this was the first of its kind initiative in the region, though it was popular in the West. 

 The facility helped people do charity by giving away things that they did not need free of cost but which could be of use to another person. It was usually done by attaching clothes hangers to a decorated wall where used clothes are hung. People who needed them would take them and walk away.
 
 The wall, painted in bright green, yellow and blue, has hanging pegs in the form of flowers installed with shirts hanging on them. Titled ‘Anbusuvar’, it would also help the people to give away clothes which would otherwise dumped as garbage. 
 
 Many residents came forward to donate sarees, shirts, `T’ shirts and books at the wall on the first day. ``This is really heartening and gives a sense of fulfillment to know that these things would help somebody,’’ said a resident who brought some clothes. Some of the books donated were novels and classics even as some people browsed through them. ``This would also be a good means to circulate books many times free of cost which will benefit many,’’ said Joseph, a resident of Tirunelveli.
 
 Sources said that if the people donating clothes cleaned them and gave them folded and, if possible even packed, it would make people who came to take them away happy. Some people who donated things in the morning came in the evening to check if somebody had taken them away. They found that some had indeed been accepted while others remained. The collector said that the wall would be put up in other parts of the district also based on the response that this one got.
