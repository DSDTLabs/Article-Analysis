CHENNAI: India’s   and   will be hoping to make a mark when the third round of the   kicks off at   in Japan this weekend. While Anish performed well in the previous round in Australia by finishing in the top-15 in both races, Rajiv has recovered from a wrist injury which forced him to miss the Australian leg. Anish and Rajiv, who are part of the  , are competing in the 250cc category. 

 
 
 
 Anish said he is riding high on confidence after notching up his first points in the international circuit in Australia and will be looking for another similarly impressive outing this time around.
 
 “The last round was a huge morale-booster for me. I finished both the races in the top-15. I am now familiar with the bike and have started to get a hang of the pressure of performing amongst the best racers of Asia. Suzuka has many fast corners, which enables a lot of overtaking opportunities. I will be trying to score more points this weekend. We are feeling confident of doing well,” Anish said.
 
 For Rajiv, it will be about getting his groove back and keeping realistic expectations after suffering a wrist injury during one of the practice races Down Under. “I want to finish in the top-15. In the first round in Thailand, I finished 16th in race 1 and 17th in race 2. In Australia, I got hit by another rider during practice and fractured my wrist. I have made a good recovery since then even though it has just been a month or so,” he said.
