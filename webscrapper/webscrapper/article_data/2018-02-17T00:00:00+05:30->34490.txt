Generally, you see many people running for a cause when they participate in marathons. But the one cause that seems to have been long ignored is the green cause. While the premise of most marathons is noble, what is worrying is the amount of thrash that is left behind; after each run, city roads are lined with plastic bottles. These add to the already critical issue of waste management. So, to ensure that this is not repeated at a   that is to be held in the city tomorrow, volunteers from the   (BeT) have approached the organizers with suggestion for a green marathon.

 “Even though marathons are for good causes, the amount of trash that results from them is unfortunate. We are working with the organizers of Sunday’s marathon to reduce the use of plastic at the event. What is encouraging is that  , the ambassador, is onboard and is doing all he can to go green,” says Seema Sharma of BeT.
 
 So, how is the run going to be eco-friendly? “There will be a green stations during the marathon where some volunteers will be giving water to runners in reusable glasses. In previous editions, food was given in plastic boxes, but this year, the organizers will be doing so in eco-friendly boxes; next year, they have said that they will serve hot lunches to runners in reusable plates. Apart from this, since the flex banners were already printed before we approached the organizers, we will be connecting them to an NGO that will make bags out of the flexes after the event. Apart from this, we have also suggested that they collaborate with waste management company   so that whatever waste is generated is segregated and managed properly,” adds Seema.
 
 If all goes as planned, BeT hopes that tomorrow’s marathon will be a good template for other marathons across the city and country. Since Sunday’s event is held in other cities as well, Seema says that the organizers have promised to ensure that their other events are eco-friendly as well.
