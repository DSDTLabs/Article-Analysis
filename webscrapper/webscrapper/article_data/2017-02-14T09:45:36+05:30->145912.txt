MUMBAI:   batsmen seemed to be in a hurry ... tearing hurry. Pitted against   in their   league game at the   on Monday, North Zone could manage just 107-8, a target which the West Zone achieved losing just the wickets of   (30) and skipper   (56).

 The hosts won the toss and chose to field and almost immediately settled into a good rhythm. Irfan Pathan and Shardul Thakur who opened proceedings for West Zone, complemented each other well, but it was Pathan, who was troubling the North Zone batsmen with his nagging line and length. 
 
 What made matters worse for the visitors was West Zone's fielding in the circle. They were extremely alert and sharp. The fact that they affected two run outs was a testament to their energy and eagerness. Pathan eventually finished with magnificent figures of 4-03-10 North Zone's seasoned campaigner Gautam Gambhir top-scored for them with 60. 
 
 With a small target of 107, all that West Zone batsmen needed to do was be patient and not try and finish off the chase in a jiffy. Skipper Patel and Iyer got the hosts off to a perfect start. The duo put on 80 runs for the opening wicket before Iyer was shockingly adjudged leg before wicket to Rasool. Patel was out playing a nothing shot when West Zone had reached 92 and needed only 16 runs for a win. But by the time Patel was castled, he had scored a 35-ball 56.
