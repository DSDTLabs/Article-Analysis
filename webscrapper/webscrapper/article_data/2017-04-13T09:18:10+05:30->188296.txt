MUMBAI:  (MSRDC) has identified six more landslide-prone areas in Bor Ghat section on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. Mitigation works at these new locations will be undertaken during monsoon. 

 Bor Ghat witnesses several landslides in rains. Rockfall mitigation work is already underway at  , Khandala and Amrutanjan bridge. Work at the new spots-one near Adoshi, three near Amrutanjan bridge, one on the   corridor and one at   tunnel-will cost Rs 64 crore. 
 
 There were at least four landslides in 2015, with one of them being fatal. Rock-bolting works taken up after these landslides ensured an episode-free monsoon in 2016.
 
 An MSRDC official said one or two lanes will be closed when rock-bolting work in the newly identified areas begins. MSRDC has invited bids and they would be opened in May. Officials declined to comment on the status of the mitigation work already underway.
