Making a children’s film has been on director Kavitha Lankesh’s to-do list for a while, but it wasn’t until she was part of the selection committee for the state film awards that she put her plan in action. “The idea and the script have been a work in progress for a while. My recent stint on the selection committee for the state film awards gave me an impetus to get the show on the road,” says the director, who is currently in Chikmagalur, shooting the film, called  , with a bunch of youngsters. The film, she adds, will mark the acting debut of her daughter  , who had hitherto been averse to facing the camera and wanted a career behind it, much like her mum. 
Kavitha’s brother, Indrajit Lankesh’s son,  , also stars in the film and the filmmaker says that having her daughter and nephew in her project was not pre-planned. “It happened organically. I wanted a bunch of kids who had a natural chemistry with each other and would be comfortable together on set. Esha and Samar are quite close to each other, and the other two kids, Sonia Hegde and Anish Angre, are Esha’s pals as well, so they all got along well. Summer Holidays, says Kavitha, will be a fun, Enid Blytonesque film that follows the adventures of five youngsters and will be made in Kannada and English.
