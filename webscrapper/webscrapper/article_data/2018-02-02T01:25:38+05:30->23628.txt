NEW DELHI:   has got a shot in the arm with the allocation of Rs 7,426 crore in the   for financial year 2018-19, Rs 1,048.80 crore more than what it got the last fiscal. This will help the department implement its pending projects, including modernisation plans. In 2017-18, it was allocated Rs 6,378.18 crore and the figure was Rs 5,913.74 the preceding year.

 However, Nirbhaya fund — which is used for women’s safety projects — has seen a dip this fiscal. Officers, however, said that this would not be an issue. In 2017-18, the allocation under this head was Rs 28.9 crore, a big jump of Rs 25.3 crore as compared to Rs 3.4 crore in 2016-17. Of the Rs 28.9 crore, Delhi Police spent around Rs 23 crore for initiatives like Sashakti, self-defence training, and Run for Laadli for awareness, etc.
 
 With three new districts and several police station buildings being added this year, the department has been allocated Rs 460.95 crore under this head, an increase of Rs 21.95 crore from 2017-18. Last fiscal, the allocation was Rs 439 crore. Under the main police fund, the department has got Rs 6,946.28 crore against Rs 5,910.28 crore allocated last year.
 
 Delhi Police didn’t spend the fund allocated in 2017-2018 and was left with an excess of almost Rs 1,300 crore till December 31, 2017.
 
 The number of corridors in which the modernised traffic management system is planned is set to increase along with the number of CCTV cameras. The projects started last year are still in their trial phase. The process to upgrade the communications network is also on.
 
 Cops hope to use the excess funds to boost the procurement process. With intelligent traffic system, open-source intelligence system and a modernised   cell seeing the light of the day, the department also plans to procure new protection systems and crowd-control devices for which the bill could exceed Rs 15 crore.
