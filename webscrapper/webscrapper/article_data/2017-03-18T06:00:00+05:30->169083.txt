KOLKATA: A   hearing the Robinson Street   on Friday directed the Shakespeare Sarani police to file a formal report intimating it of  .

 De, the US-returned software engineer, who spent six months with the skeletal remains of his sister and two pet dogs before they were discovered, ended his life at a Watgunge flat on February 22.
 
 On December 5, police had slapped a chargesheet against De under IPC sections 268 (public nuisance) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infectious disease). The penal sections have a maximum six-month prison term, are bailable and triable by a magistrate. The case is now before a Bankshall magistrate.
 
 De could not attend the hearing on September 20 or December 28 last year and the next date was set on March 17. When the case came up on Friday, no one appeared for De. The public prosecutor informed the court of his death, prompting the magistrate to seek a formal report.
 
 Lawyer Tarun Chatterjee said, “De is the sole accused. With his death the case no longer stands. But to formally close the case, the investigating officer has to submit a death report, based on which the magistrate will close the case. This is a legal requirement.”
