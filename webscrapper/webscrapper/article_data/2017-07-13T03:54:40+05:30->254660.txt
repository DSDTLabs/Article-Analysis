Mumbai: A sessions court recently convicted and sentenced a 26-year-old man to   for the   of a 78-year-old Malad woman and robbery in 2012. Girvarsing Devda, who used to work at a sugarcane stall of the victim’s daughter, had decamped with jewellery, and currency notes and coins amounting to over Rs 3 lakh.

 A liquor shop-owner, to whom the accused had handed over part of the booty of Rs 1,100 in coins, as payment for liquor, turned out to be a key witness who helped nail him in court. The coins were recovered from the witness.
 
 Chetnaben Vora, daughter of the victim, Nirmala, went to her stall at about 11.30am on November 4, 2012. She said she called her mother in the evening and chatted with her. She further said that at 9.30pm, her mother did not answer her calls. Chetnaben said that when she returned home at 11.30pm, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood, with a deep injury on her  . She recalled that two cupboards in the hall were open, their drawers were pulled out, and clothes were scattered around. After she screamed for help, neighbours arrived at the scene and called doctors and cops.
 
 Cops suspected the accused, after he did not return to work at the stall the day after the incident. He was traced to Udaipur, Rajasthan, where he had absconded. Besides the statement of the liquor shop-owner, the court also relied on the statement of Rajkumar Chaudhary, who had seen the accused near the house on the day of the incident. Chaudhary, who worked with a supplier of sugarcane, said he had gone to the victim’s house to deliver sugarcane at 5.30pm. 
 
 The court pointed out that jewellery and other articles were recovered from the house of the accused. “All these proved facts are sufficient to fully establish that only the accused had committed the charged crime. All these facts are inconsistent with innocence of the accused,” the court held.
