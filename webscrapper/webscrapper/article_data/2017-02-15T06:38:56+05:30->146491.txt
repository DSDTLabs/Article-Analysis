NEW DELHI: It's Valentine's Day, and India's warring   industry decided to play along with the theme of love. Telecom players decided to forget their bickering for a day as they wished each other a 'Happy Valentine's Day' on Twitter.

 Mukesh Ambani's  , whose entry has been seen as the reason of trouble for the older, established telecom companies such as  ,   and  , made the first move when it wished rivals through its twitter handle, "Dear @airtelindia, @VodafoneIN, @ideacellular, Happy Valentine's Day. #WithLoveFromJio". 
 
 
 
 Jio's free services have been blamed by the three telcos for the dent in their profitability and apart from the market, the companies are fighting it out even in various legal courts -Delhi high court, Competition Commission of India, and Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal.
 
 Jio had sent the tweet at 10am, virtually catching the other companies by surprise and leading to a lot of cheeky remarks from the twitterati.
 
 Idea Cellular was the first to respond, but after a gap of nearly two-and-a-half hours. "@reliancejio Same to you! Nice to know that love is in the air today. @airtelindia @VodafoneIN," Idea said in its tweet.
 
 Airtel, which has been particularly critical of Jio and has accused the company of disrupting financials of the industry , decided to respond by 3.45 pm, with a cheeky compliment, borrowed from one of its highly advertised promotional campaigns. "Same feels @reliancejio! After all #HarEkFriendZarooriHotaHai @VodafoneIN @ideacellular."And at 4.50pm,   decided to respond as it tweeted, "Let's all #BeSuper This Valentine's Day".
 
 
 
  #BeSuper happens to be one of the marketing and promotional hashtags of Vodafone on twitter.
