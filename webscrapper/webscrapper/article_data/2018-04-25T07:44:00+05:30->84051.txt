Rohtak: With Jodhpur special SC/ST court in Rajasthan slated to announce the verdict in the rape case against godman Asaram Bapu and his son Narayan Sai on Wednesday, key witness in the matter Mahender Chawla of Panipat has demanded additional security cover for himself.

 Chawla, personal assistant of Narayan Sai who became a state witness, was attacked near his home in 2015. He was given security cover by Haryana police. Currently, five police personnel are deployed round-the-clock in his security at Panipat. Earlier, 40-year-old Chawla had the security cover of two police personnel.

Chawla, who lives at Sanoli Khurd village, had to remain in hospital for several days to recover from his critical bullet injuries.
 
 On the order of the Jodhpur court, Chawla said that whether the verdict was in favour of Asaram or against him, his life would be in danger for testifying against the powerful sect leader and his son. He said witnesses like him would need constant security cover. Chawla said earlier also 10 witnesses, including him, were attacked for deposing against Asaram and his son in the court. The godman was booked for rape under relevant sections of the IPC, Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the SCs/STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act following a complaint against him by a minor girl from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who had stayed at his ashram.
