NEW DELHI: The high court on Wednesday allowed devotees to use the   near Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib in   for two days, in view of birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh.

 A bench of Justices B D Ahmed and   granted the relief, taking into account the special circumstances and permitting use of the piao on Thursday and Friday.
 
 Earlier this year the corporation had razed the piao on court orders but it was reconstructed overnight. After that, the court had prohibited anyone from using the water fountain which claimed as sacred by Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee. The committee told court the piao was within the pillar of the Gurudwara and that it was part of a historical structure.
 
 Meanwhile, the bench also sought reports from Delhi government on progress in its project to revitalise Shahjanabad.
 
 In related directions, the court also took stock of progress made in registration of cycle rickshaws for plying in Chandni Chowk and issuing them licenses.   on Wednesday told court it received over 700 applications out of which 348 cycle rickshaws were issued licenses.
 
 Main petitioner in the case, NGO Manushi, however highlighted in court that the licenses issued donâ€™t bear any license number and even lacks signature of the licensing authority.   then directed the corporation to file an affidavit with a list of persons who had their rickshaws registered, including their registration numbers.
