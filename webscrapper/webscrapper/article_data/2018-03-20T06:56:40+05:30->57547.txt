BENGALURU: From April 1, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike will take building plan approval submissions for all new projects —   — online.

 As per the new system,   officials must clear plan submissions in 30 days. Each officer is assigned a certain timeframe to clear the plan, failing which the portal for that application gets locked and the officer is punished.
 
 However, owners of 40ftx60ft or smaller sites planning construction will have to continue the manual route, seeking permission from the requisite engineers.
 
 Mayor   and BBMP commissioner   said the new system will streamline the plan approval process and bring in more efficiency, besides reducing applicants’ legwork.
 
 
 
 
 According to Prasad, applicants need to log in to the BBMP website after April 1 and register with their credentials to get the process started. Online updates about progress of the application will be notified to citizens, who can make requisite payments online.
 
 Bengaluru development minister   said the new system will benefit lakhs of property owners. “We’ll take strict action taken against those who deviate from plans, besides holding officials and errant architects responsible,” he said.
 
 The mayor said about 200 fresh applications are filed per zone every month on average.
 
 He said that as the Karnataka government was planning to introduce the trust-and-verify procedure for all sites across the state, small property owners (with site measurements of 40ftx60ft or less) will not be covered under the new system for now. The trust-andverify system is modelled on the self-assessment scheme currently in place for property tax collection.
 
 Once the system is implemented, property owners must engage an architect to submit their plan and start work, subject to an inspection and online analysis for bylaw conformity.
