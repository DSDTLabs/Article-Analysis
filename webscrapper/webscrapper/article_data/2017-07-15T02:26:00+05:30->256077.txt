Vijayawada: Having been badly hit by the spread of viral fevers taking lives of more than half a dozen tribals in the state, the government has finally decided to launch a separate   scheme  . This will cater to the health requirements of   students in the first phase.

 The state government had issued GO No. 60 on Friday allowing the tribal welfare department to outsource medical services of the experts for the inmates of tribal welfare educational institutions in the state. The GO is based on a proposal sent by the special commissioner of tribal welfare on June 10, 2017. The special commissioner said the tribal children are suffering from diseases like club foot, cognitive delay, convulsive disorders, congenital heart diseases, dental problems, cleft lips and others.
 
 Quoting from a survey, the special commissioner said that about 74 %of the tribal children are anaemic. The commissioner identified that one of the major reasons for the death of students in the tribal educational institutions is anaemia. The commissioner said that 23% of the children are severely anaemic while 76 % are anaemic.
 
 The commissioner said that the tribal educational institutions, including the hostels, do not conduct regular health check-ups. While stressing the need to have a regular medical officer or a qualified person attached to every educational institute, he suggested that the government can ‘rope in a knowledge partner to outsource the services of regular screening of the students, identification of the anaemic and referral cases, tracking of health record, monitoring of the consumption of special diet of the students.’
