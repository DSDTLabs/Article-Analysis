Tirupur: Kangeyam all-woman police have booked 10 people under the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Woman Harassment Act after a 19-year-old migrant from Assam lodged a complaint against them.

 The girl has been working in a private knitwear manufacturing unit at SIDCO in Mudhalipalayam for the last nine months, police sources said. 
 
 “She was staying in the company hostel. According to her, Karthik and Sukumaran, also from Assam and working in the same company, used to misbehaved with her often in the company premises. But, the company management did not take any action against them despite she raised the issue. On April 16, when she was walking towards her hostel, eight youths, who were aides of one Tiwari, tried to kidnap her on a two-wheeler. Commuters and local residents rescued her. Sensing that she would lodge a police complaint regarding the incident, the company management had allegedly locked her inside a room,” a police officer said.
 
 The girl told police that she managed to escape from the room after two days.
