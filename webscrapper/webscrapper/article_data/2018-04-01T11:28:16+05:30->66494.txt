TRICHY: The forest department in Trichy is planning to engage traditional water diviners to identify new groundwater sources inside forests that would quench the thirst of animals.

 Diviners from nearby villages will help identify water sources in the reserve forests with a depth of 6-7 feet from the surface. The forest department is counting on such arrangements to prevent wild animals from straying into human habitations in search of water during summer.
 
 No borewells or open wells would be dug in such places. Instead, the aquifer will be carved in a saucer shape to ensure water stagnation.
 
 “These small pond-like structures are expected to meet the needs of wild animals and also rule out the risk of them getting drowned as the slope would be extended on all sides rather than digging deeper,” said a senior official from the forest department.
 
 Certain pockets in the forest are fed by water streams during the monsoon. The water streams dry up after the monsoon but these pockets store water inside them and form an aquifer.
 
 “Local groundwater diviners will be engaged in the work since they have better knowledge of the terrain and the path of the water streams. The cost factor has also made us rely on them,” said a range officer.
 
 Thuvarankurichi and   forest ranges are likely to get such arrangements at the earliest as wild gaur from these areas often come out in search of water and meet with accidents.
 
 “The move is most likely to yield results in   and Trichy forest ranges that fall on the bank of the   river. But it is unlikely that other forest ranges may have water especially in such dry conditions,” said  , a geology professor at SASTRA University.
