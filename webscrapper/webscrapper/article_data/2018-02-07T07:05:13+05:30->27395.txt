NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court said on Tuesday that judges appeared to have lost sight of two cardinal principles - bail is the rule and jail the exception, and a person is innocent till found guilty - and that this had resulted in routine denial of bail, long incarceration, and overcrowded jails. 

  "This does not do any good to our criminal jurisprudence or to our society," a bench of Justice   and Justice   said. The bench has been dealing with the inhuman treatment of inmates in 1,382 prisons, and has passed several orders to bring reforms in prison management and provide succour to prisoners. 
 
  C onceding that grant of bail was completely within a judge's discretionary powers, the bench said the judge must introspect whether it would be the right decision to deny bail and at the same time have a humane approach in imposing bail conditions so that an accused had the capacity to comply with them and get out of jail. "Conditions for grant of bail ought not to be so strict as to be incapable of compliance, thereby making the grant of bail illusory," said Justice Lokur. 
 
  The   said judges could consider granting bail if an accused was participating in the investigation, not tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses, and was a first-time offender. 
 
  "Poverty or deemed indigent status of an accused is also an extremely important factor and even   has taken notice of it by incorporating Explanation to Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. An equally soft approach to incarceration has been taken by Parliament by inserting Section 436A in CrPC," the bench said.
