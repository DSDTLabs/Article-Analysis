PATNA: A Katihar   has issued non-bailable warrant against   minister   after he failed to appear on three consecutive dates for the process of charging frame in a nine years’ old case for violation of model code of conduct.

 The court of additional chief judicial magistrate Ravi Kumar on Thursday fixed the next date of hearing on March 15. Kushwaha, who is also the   chief, represents Karakat Lok Sabha constituency in Rohtas district.
 
 Kushwaha’s counsel Umashankar Singh said the matter was related to 2009 Lok Sabha election when a poster with Kushwaha’s photo was found pasted in Bazaar Samiti under the Town police station area in Katihar. “Model code of conduct was enforced and the then sadar SDO had lodged an FIR against Kushwaha. BSP candidate   was also made accused in the FIR for another poster found in the same area,” Singh said, adding Kushwaha’s poster was not linked to general elections, but it was an old one.
 
 Singh said the trial is in the final stages of framing charges and Kushwaha’s appearance is necessary for prosecution’s explanation, in which the judge would read out allegations against him and register his reply.
 
 “It was prayed before the court thrice to grant time for physical appearance as Kushwaha was busy due to his ministerial profile. The court agreed each time but it got annoyed on the fourth date and issued the non-bailable warrant against him,” Singh said, adding the minister would seek bail on the next date of hearing. The court had granted bail to Kushwaha in the case on April 24, last year.
 
 RLSP Katihar district president   said Kushwaha was informed about the order and he would comply with the court’s directives.
