LUDHIANA: In a jolt for BJP and especially ex-health minister   (who recently joined Congress party along with Neetu after BJP's ticket from Ludhiana central was given to Gurdev Sharma Debi but he made a U-turn later), his close confidant councillor   openely campaigned with Surinder Dawar, Congress party’s candidate from Ludhiana Central seat on Saturday. 

 It is pertinent to mention here that a week ago, BJP state president Vijay Sampla had come to Ludhiana and organised a meeting at BJP office where Gosain was also present and it was claimed that Gosain is still a part of BJP and Neetu will also join back soon.
  
 Meanwhile in today’s campaign, Neetu was accompanied by his wife Gurmeet Kaur Neetu and he claimed that his wife has also joined Congress and both of them will campaign in entire Ludhiana for the Congress party and its candidates. 
 
 Speaking to TOI about the latest development, Neetu said, “I am very much part of the congress party and there is no question of going back to BJP. I joined Congress party in presence of Captain Amarinder Singh who is going to be the next chief minister of Punjab. Mine and Gosain sahib’s point of view and thinking was same when we joined Congress, but unfortunately his point of view has changed now and therefore he has joined back BJP. But I am not a football and I will remain in Congress and as I have made it clear earlier as well that my reason for leaving the party is ticket on central constituency being given to an undeserving candidate instead of me. BJP has totally ignored me and all my hard work done for the party has gone down the drain. Therefore, I will leave no stone unturned to make sure that BJP gets defeated in these elections.”
