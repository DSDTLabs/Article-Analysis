CHENNAI: Holding that ‘katta panchayats’ (kangaroo courts) subverted the judicial process, the Madras high court has warned it will frame guidelines if the state government did not not enact the promised special law soon.

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice M  , passing further orders on a PIL, said: “We have made it clear to the advocate general that though we cannot issue any directions to enact any legislation, we will have little option but to step in and issue guidelines to fill in the vacuum existing in this behalf so as to subserve the judicial system and prevent its subversion.”
 
 Posting the matter for further hearing to March 24, the bench said it would issue the guidelines the next day unless “we are informed that the draft legislation is ready with the intent of the government to propose it to the assembly.”
 
 In 2005, a man named Gopal approached the high court to direct police to register his complaint and direct Nalla Thanneer   in   to return Rs 40,000 illegally collected. Another PIL relates to a newspaper report of a family ostracized and fined Rs 500 by the villagers in 2006.
 
 After a series of orders and compliances, the government last year promised a special law to contain the scourge. On Thursday, after advocate general sought more time to enact a law, the bench said: “We are pained at the approach adopted by the state government in not doing anything about an issue like katta panchayat, which seeks to subvert the judicial process and, consequently, the Constitution of India... We have been receiving only assurances for more than a year despite the ground work done by the learned amicus while submitting his report.”
 
 Pointing out that on January 22, 2016 the state’s public secretary appeared in court and said a special law was under the ‘active consideration’ of the government, the bench said: “We find the position no different in the request made by AG today, once again, saying that a special law had to be framed.”
