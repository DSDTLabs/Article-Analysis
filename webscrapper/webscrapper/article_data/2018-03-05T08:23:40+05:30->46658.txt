LUDHIANA: A 35-year-old man and his nephew were killed and his brother injured when an SUV and a car collided head-on near   in Dugri on Sunday morning. 

 The labourers were standing on the road to cross it when, after the crash, the car toppled over them.
 
 The deceased have been identified as Rohit Kumar, 19, and his paternal uncle   of Dugri. Harku's brother Gopal Rishi received injuries. The car occupants were a would-be bride, Malika Walia, and her brother Jatanvir Walia of Phase-II Dugri. The SUV driver,  , 45, has been booked as he was speeding.
 
 Rohit, with his uncles Harku and Gopal, left house for work around 7.30am. They were standing near   to cross the road. Meanwhile, Jatanvir, along with Malaika, was heading towards a makeup studio to get her ready for her marriage. At the junction, the speeding SUV collided with the car. The impact was such that the latter turned turtle on Rohit and his uncles.
 
 While Harku died on spot, Rohit succumbed to injuries on way to hospital. Gopal is undergoing treatment at civil hospital. He has sustained a fracture in his leg. Gopal said, "I was standing behind Rohit and Harku, so I escaped with injuries."
 
 Passersby brought Malika and Jatanvir out of the damaged car and called up the police.
 
 Even as Malika also received minor injuries, she left the spot immediately.
 
 The police removed the car from the road and impounded the SUV.
 
 The Dugri police have booked Kulwinder, also a Phase-II Dugri resident, under sections 304-A (causing death by negligence), 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC.
