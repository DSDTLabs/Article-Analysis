Noida: The excise department has floated e-tenders to issue licences for liquor shops in each district. The licences will be issued through an e-lottery system to the applicants. The new excise policy aims to provide licenses to individuals for district-wise licences instead of zonal licences.

 In January, 2018, excise minister Jai Pratap Singh had said that the new Excise Policy 2018-19 approved by the state cabinet aims to enable entrepreneurs and individuals to foray into the liquor business. The state government, on January 23, scrapped the old liquor policy wherein there were special zones in western UP districts of Meerut, Moradabad and Saharanpur, which had allowed syndicate to have monopoly over the liquor business.
 
 The officials said interested people can log on to www.upexciseelottery.gov.in and fill up the registration form. The applications will be accepted till 7 pm on February 28. The announcement of results through e-lottery will be made by the district administration in March.
 
 The official said that the applicant must be Indian citizens and older than 21-years. The officials will also investigate the applicant’s background and ensure that the allottees are not involved in criminal activities.
 
 The district excise department said that the licences for model shop will be issued for one year. One applicant shall have a maximum two shop in the district. “E-tender under the new policy aims to bring transparency in the allocation of licences to the liquor kiosk. People with experience or new comers can apply and participate in the process. This will create a level playing field for people in this field,” said district magistrate B N Singh.
