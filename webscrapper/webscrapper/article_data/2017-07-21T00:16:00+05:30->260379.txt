Colva: Margao town police on Tuesday arrested a person for touting and sourcing official files from cupboards in the offices of the mamlatdar and deputy collectors. South Goa collector Swapnil Naik said he received a complaint from the revenue ministerâ€™s office, upon which he directed the police to investigate the matter. Arvind Coutinho from Navelim, in a letter to revenue minister Rohan Khaunte, had stated that Octaviano Coutinho, a resident of Chinchinim, would take up cases of mutation and survey number partition, and obtain conversion sanads, residency certificates and divergence certificates. The complainant, who supported his claims with a video recording, had said the accused was so influential that he would source files from cupboards in the offices of the mamlatdar and deputy collectors, and in some cases, even hide documents. He had further alleged that the accused was never deterred by the staff because he was considered an agent of the mamlatdars and deputy collectors.  The complainant had stated that at around 11.30am on June 6, when he was in the office of the deputy collector, he saw Octaviano removing official files and rummaging through them, and went on to record the incident on his cellphone. Noticing that he was being filmed, Octaviano attempted to snatched the phone, Arvind alleged. Margao police inspector C L Patil said an FIR was registered in the case on Tuesday and Octaviano was arrested and subsequently released on bail. His residence, however, was not raided.  In a letter to the revenue minister, a Navelim man stated that Octaviano Coutinho of Chinchinim, would take up cases of mutation and survey number partition, and obtain conversion sanads, residency certificates and divergence certificates, and that he would source files from cupboards in the offices of the mamlatdar and deputy collectors
