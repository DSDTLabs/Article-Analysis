MUMBAI: Can the BMC stop collecting  ,   asked on Thursday. 

 A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Riyaz Chagla was hearing a petition filed by a Dadar-based   challenging a notice by the civic body threatening to stop collecting garbage as it was a bulk generator of solid waste. While the court refused to grant relief to the restaurant, it asked the BMC about what happens if citizens start throwing garbage on the streets. 
 
 “It is for the BMC to decide whether it plans to do what it has threatened to do (stop collecting garbage),” the bench said while asking what it plans to do if people start throwing garbage outside on footpaths and streets. “It will create huge nuisance to nearby residents and citizens,” the court said. The court clarified that these were its prima facie observations. 
 
 “Is it the BMC’s stand that it will allow people to dump solid waste outside. If you check the rules it does not absolve the municipal corporation from ensuring that solid waste does not accumulate,” said Justice Oka.
 
  The advocate representing the restaurant said rules do not make it mandatory for   to have waste disposal facilities. The bench said it could not go into the issue of whether the restaurant was a bulk waste generator as evidence would have to be led on the issue. 
 
 It gave the restaurant the option to approach the appropriate court to file a suit.
