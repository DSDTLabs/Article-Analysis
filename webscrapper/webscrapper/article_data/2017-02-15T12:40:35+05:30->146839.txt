It has not even been two months since   delivered a baby boy in December and she’s already making headlines for her weight loss. It seems like nothing can stop Kareena to get back in shape or her even her career. She has been giving stylish appearances ever since—from her dinner date with hubby Saif Ali Khan to turning a charismatic showstopper at Anita Dongre’s show, Kareena is slaying it.

 Yesterday, she went live on social media with celebrity nutritionist   talking about her diet and weight loss. While she did bust few health mantras, we can’t stop gawking at how stunning she looked. She was seen wearing an off-shoulder bardot dress from Ankita Choksey.
