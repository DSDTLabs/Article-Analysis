Ekta Kaul, who played   in the show, is currently serving her notice period. She will bid adieu to Mere Angne... in the first week of March. Ekta, who will be tying the knot later this year, says “I do not want to go into details of my personal life. I have 
always wanted to get married to a guy who understands me and someone whom I can talk to without any reluctance. I have found my soulmate. Marriage is important and it is not an easy ride as you have to constantly work on it.”
