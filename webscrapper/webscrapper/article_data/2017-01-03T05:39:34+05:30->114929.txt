MIM chief  's Sunday statement escalated the war of words with the   ahead of the BMC polls. Several speakers, including Owaisi, hit out at the SP for thriving on Muslim votes but doing "precious little" for the community. SP leaders condemned the MIM's allegations and said the use of rhetoric and a communal tone would polarize voters and hurt the Muslim cause. 

  "The Sena-BJP which has ruled the BMC is on a weak wicket for its failure to improve the city's infrastructure but MIM is making the ruling combine's task easier by polarizing the voters along communal lines. Communal demands like a separate share for Muslims in the BMC budget will only hurt the cause of the community," said SP corporator Rais Shaikh, who is planning to fight from   instead of his existing ward in Govandi. 
 
  SP, especially Shaikh, is peeved with remarks of MIM leaders against him for shifting his ward from Govandi to Madanpura. Govandi, with SP's lone   in the state   from here, is seen as SP's bastion.
