PATNA: The Shaheed Veer Kunwar Singh  , commonly known as  , would soon be developed as the heritage park of the state.

 This concept has been incorporated in the   proposal for Patna which would be sent to the Centre soon. Patna municipal commissioner   said the concept has been taken from The Charles Bridge Museum located in Prague in Europe. 
 
 “Replica of various monuments of Bihar would be displayed in the park. There would be miniature models of Buddhist circuit, Jain circuit, Ramanaya circuit, Sufi circuit and Gandhi circuit at the park along with brief write up so that visitors could have better understanding about different tourist spots of Bihar. This concept would also benefit students,” said the municipal commissioner. 
 
 The proposal also suggests a library inside the park along with computers. In the library too, special focus would be given on the books related to the history and culture of Bihar. Altogether Rs 50 crore would be spent on developing this park spread in an area of around 22 acres. There would also be a cafeteria outside the park. 
 
 Sources in   said the tourism department had shown its interest to develop this British era park and was ready to bear 50% of the cost incurred in developing it. The final Smart City proposal would be sent to the Centre in the last week of March this year.
