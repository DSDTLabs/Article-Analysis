LUCKNOW: The   government on Friday ordered the setting up of a fee regulatory committee in each division, headed by a divisional commissioner and with the joint director of education as its member-secretary. The committee will also include representatives of parents' association and school managements. 

 The ordinance affects schools which charge more than Rs 20,000 per annum as fees. The schools would be penalized for not adhering to rules. A fine of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh will be levied on schools for their first and second violations, respectively, while the third could even lead to derecognition. 
 
  All   will have to reveal their fee structure. The committee, however, will hear only those complaints which school authorities will fail to dispose of within 15 days.
 
  Deputy chief minister   addressed district inspectors of schools through   on Friday in this regard.
