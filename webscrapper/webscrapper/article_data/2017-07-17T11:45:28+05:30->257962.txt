VIJAYAWADA: The two major political parties have summoned their legislators to be present in the capital by Sunday evening to be available for voting in the Presidential elections scheduled for Monday.

 Telugu Desam Party president and Chief Minister   had already sent a word to all party MLAs and MPs to be present and cast their votes for the NDA Presidential candidate  . While some of the MPs have already reached Parliament, MLAs from Rayalaseema and Uttarandhra reached the capital on Sunday evening.
 
 The Opposition   too had asked its MPs and MLAs to be present in the capital to vote in the early morning poll at the Amaravati Assembly premises. YSR Congress president YS   had directed the party MPs to proceed to the national capital and exercise their vote in Parliament. 
 
 He had also directed the MLAs to reach the capital ahead of the election and cast their vote during early hours on Monday at the Velagapudi Assembly Hall. YSR Congress had already extended support to the NDA candidate. Interestingly, except a couple of Rajya Sabha members who belong to the Congress, the Andhra Pradesh state is set to go with the NDA as the ruling TDP and the Opposition YSR Congress have decided to vote for him. 
 
 The TDP has 104 legislators on its count besides the 20 legislators who have crossed the floor from the YSR Congress, taking the TDPâ€™s total strength to 124, while the BJP has four legislators who would be voting for Ram Nath Kovind. The YSR Congress has now 46 legislators after the defection of 21 legislators.
 
 UPA candidate Meira Kumar, would be getting not a single vote from the Assembly as neither the Congress nor the Left have their members in the Assembly. Perhaps this is the reason why the UPA candidate did not visit the state as part of her campaign in the run for the highest office.
