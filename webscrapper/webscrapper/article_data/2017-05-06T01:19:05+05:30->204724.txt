We want to sensitise people to make swachhta a routine,” said NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar.
 
 About 2,500 volunteers would also be present at 50 points. “They will sweep the roads, pick up wrappers and food packets people throw on the streets,” said NDMC spokesperson M S Shehrawat.

There are around 50,000 households in NDMC areas. It’s trying to achieve 100% segregation of waste at source by June 5, World Environment Day.
