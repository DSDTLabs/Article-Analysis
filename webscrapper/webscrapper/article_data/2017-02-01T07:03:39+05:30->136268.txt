KOLKATA: A little over six months after   withdrew its operation in the Kolkata-Durgapur-Delhi route, Zoom Air, a Delhi-based airlines, starts its operation in the same routes seven days a week from Sunday.   (Andal) will also act as the regional hub of the company.

 Interestingly, GoAir and In diGo have proposed to operate flights from KNIA, but the proposals are yet to take final shape. Bhutan and Bangladesh Airlines are also interested as reported earlier. Air India has withdrawn its services but talks are going on to resolve the issues, said officials in   (BAPL), the developer and operator of the Greenfield project.
 
 Koustav Mohan Dhar, executive director and CEO of Zoom Air, told TOI: “We will be running scheduled 50-seater full-service flight daily from KNIA. We are keeping the introductory fare rather low.From Kolkata to Durgapur, the fare will be Rs 1,000 and from Durgapur to Delhi, the fare will be Rs 3,000.“
 
 There are plans to introduce a daily flight to Mumbai and Hyderabad. Zoom Air India has got a series of Bombardier CRJ200LR (long range version) and 2 CRJ-900 aircrafts. “We look forward to support both from the state government and BAPL. Being a scheduled operator, we are not looking for viability gap-funding. VGF is mostly sought by non-scheduled flight operators,“ said Dhar.
 
 The CRJ-200LR aircraft, which will be flying in this route, has a soundproof 6'2“ tall cabin and two cabin attendant seats. The aircraft performance has been found to be faster than any commercial aircraft in India, allowing passengers to reach their destinations in lesser time in a comfortable and premium seating experience.
 
 BAPL, which developed the greenfield airport, said the cost of operations or the VGF would have been almost half in case of a private airline compared to that of Air India.
 
 BAPL said it was the only private airport operator in the country to offer VGF to an airline to operate scheduled flights.
