KOLKATA: Union minister   has reacted to the controversy over his name being allegedly dragged by actor-turned-Trinamool MP   in Bhubaneswar. The latter is in   for his alleged involvement in the  .

  Said Supriyo, “I have asked the TV channels to provide me the footage where he and his wife have named me. I already have some and based on those, I have instructed my lawyers to immediately explore the options for a stringent defamation case. Whatever Derek posted on Twitter or Didi said (though from the CM's chair) are political accusations, a very cliched behaviour of politicians. I have to take that in my stride but saying things while in CBI custody is a pretty serious misdemeanour. I am contemplating serious legal options against him.”
