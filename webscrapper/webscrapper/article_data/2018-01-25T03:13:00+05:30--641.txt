Vijayawada: Religious fervour marked the   celebrations in the city on Wednesday. Temples in the city saw a huge rush as   and other rituals were performed by devotees. 

 Devotees thronged the Bhavani and the Durga ghats from early morning for a holy dip in River Krishna. Guided by Vedic scholars, they offered the special Surya Namaskar to Sun God.
 
 Vedic scholars offered prayers to Surya Bhagavan at Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanams. Endowments commissioner and temple incharge executive officer YV Anuradha also offered prayers. “Worshipping Sun God is an important part of the Ratha Saptami. Surya Bhagavan is the visible god who is the basis of our life so we offer the Surya Puja,” said Pandit Siva Prasada Sarma, chief temple priest.
