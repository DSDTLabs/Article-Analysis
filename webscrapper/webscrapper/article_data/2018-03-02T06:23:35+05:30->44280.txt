AHMEDABAD: Despite prices remaining slightly on the higher side, gold imports in February across   have seen a significant increase. Settling at 7.50 metric tonne (MT) in February this year, imports of the yellow metal witnessed a significant increase by 182% as compared to the previous month, when gold imports settled at a mere 2.65 MT. 

 Gold analysts say that in the first week of February, restocking of gold took place soon after the budget announcement. Explaining this further,  , president, Gems and Jewellery Trade Council, said, "The gold imports in January had declined because investors, stockists and jewellers shunned from stocking up on gold, ahead of the   budget, expecting a cut in basic customs duty on gold. However, most jewellers eventually stocked up on the required amount of gold and thus, the gold imports went up."
 
 At the same time the rupee has been weakening of late, which is also projected as one of the reasons for gold imports to have shot up. "The rupee has weakened of late against the dollar and therefore, imports of gold have shot up significantly. Besides, wedding muhurats in March are buoyant and to cater to orders, jewellers have stocked up on gold," said  , secretary,   (IBJA).
