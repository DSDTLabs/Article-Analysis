GURGAON: A  , who is in India on business visa, was booked on Sunday night for allegedly buying three iPhone 6s by using a cloned visa card. Peter Johnson, according to police, went to the   in Ambience Mall around 9:30pm on Sunday and bought the phones worth Rs 1,48,500.

 Soon after the payment got processed, store staffers received a call from the HDFC Bank, Delhi, claiming that the card used for the transaction was cloned, and not original. The store was also asked to stop the delivery of the merchandise to Johnson.
 
 Store employees, in turn, informed the DLF phase 3 police station about the fraud.
 
 Police said employees of the store confirmed the identity of Johnson through a copy of his passport, which they had received from him while he was making the transaction.
 
 Assistant sub inspector Vivek of the DLF phase III police station said Johnson had come to India on business visa, and plays football. “He claims that he lives in Delhi, and hasn’t revealed how he cloned the card yet,” said Vivek.
 
 On the complaint of Vikas Tiwari, a team leader at the Sony Centre, an FIR was registered at the DLF Phase-II police station under sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468 and 471 (fraud) of the IPC.
 
 “Soon after receiving the complaint, we went to the mall. The accused was on the mall premises when we reached there. He is in police custody,” Vivek said.
 
 Johnson will be produced in the court on December 11.
