Deen Dennis, younger son of renowned scriptwriter  , is turning director. And his first movie will have none other than   in the lead role. The big budget film, which is untitled yet, will be the first ‘game thriller’ in Malayalam, according to the director, who is also scripting the film. “The story will have elements of gaming in the story, and will be the first of its kind in Malayalam. If I reveal more, the suspense will be lost.”

 On the story, he says, “A series of mysterious incidents occur in Kochi city. Mammootty plays a 39-year-old, named Vinod Menon who is a travel buff. Vinod starts his journey from Kochi and on the way he comes across several characters, and these encounters link him to the mysterious events.”
 
 The film will be a “mass thriller, and will have elements of action, drama, romance, humour and adventure,” he adds. On how Mammootty came into the film, Deen says, “I knew Mammootty listens only to one-liners so I made a story outline and approached him. But he listened for two and a half hours, and asked me to take my time and write the entire script. I was planning to rope in another director but Mammootty asked me to direct the film myself, so here I am,” he says.
 
 Mammootty’s will be a completely different character altogether, adds Kaloor Dennis, who, interestingly, has scripted 24 films of Mammootty from Aa Rathri to 
  including several hits.
 
 The rest of the cast hasn’t been decided yet but there will be another young actor from Malayalam as well as a star from Tamil, says Deen. Shoot for the film will start in December 2018 in Kochi and Bangalore.
