LUCKNOW: The row over eviction of former UP chief ministers from government bungalows as per the   order took a curious turn on Friday when   chief   sent a representation to CM   claiming that the  , for which she has been served notice, was not her residence but a memorial named after party founder Kanshi Ram. 

 In the representation sent to Yogi through her aide and party MP SC Mishra, Mayawati said the house allotted to her in the capacity of ex-UP CM was actually situated at 6, Lal  , which she was ready to vacate. The allotment of the 6, LBS Marg house was done on December 23, 2011, when Mayawati was still the CM.
 
 Mayawati also attached a copy of a government order, dated January 13, 2011, declaring her 13-A Mall Avenue residence as 'Shri Kanshiramji Yadgaar Vishram Sthal', which cannot be allotted to any person in future. 
 
 She added that she also stayed in a small portion of 13-A Mall Avenue to take care of the memorial. The BSP chief said that the memorial had Kanshi Ram's statues and murals besides a museum which was visited by scores of BSP supporters every year on his birth and death anniversary.
