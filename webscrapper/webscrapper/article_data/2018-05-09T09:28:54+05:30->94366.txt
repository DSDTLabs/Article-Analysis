NEW DELHI: Markets on Wednesday opened lower with the benchmark BSE   down over 50 points, while the broader   stayed above the 10,700-mark. In the morning trade, Sensex was trading 54 points or 0.15 per cent lower at 35,162 and Nifty was down 11 points or 0.11 per cent at 10,707.

 
 TCS, Tata Steel, ONGC and Infosys were among the major gainers on Sensex with their stocks surging as much as 1.15 per cent.
 
 Stocks on Tuesday weathered yet another choppy session to end with modest gains as participants chose to book profits amid elevated global crude oil prices and geopolitical uncertainties. The 30-share Sensex opened positive and advanced to the session's high of 35,388.87. However, profit-booking by investors ahead of Karnataka elections this week trimmed the gains, with the gauge sinking to the day's low of 35,136.01.
 
 "Market turned volatile as investors are concerned on the movement of rupee and surge in oil price which could eventually lead to tight monetary policy.
 
 "Albeit, banks outperformed as sentiment improved on account of early recognition of stressed assets. Continued outflow of foreign money will keep rupee on tenterhook while increasing GST collection and RBIs open market operation may soften the volatility," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.
 
 
 
 
 Oil prices surged while Asian stock markets traded mixed after President Donald Trump announced the United States will withdraw from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and re-impose sanctions. Resulting rising oil prices would have a mixed impact across the region, driving prices higher for some countries that rely heavily on imports, such as Japan, while boosting revenues for exporters such as Indonesia.
