BHUBANESWAR: With the country reeling from a cash crisis post-demonetisation, a 17-year-old science student from  's   district has devised a technique to generate electricity from scrapped Rs 500 notes. His innovation has now grabbed national attention, with the   directing the state science and technology department to submit a report regarding the project.

 Lachman Dundi, a student of  , said he could produce up to five volts from a single Rs 500 note. “I used the silicon coating on the note to create energy .I tore up the note so that the coating is visible, which I exposed to direct sunlight. The silicon plate has to be connected to a transformer with an electric wire. This can help generate electricity .“
 
 
 
 On April 12, the PMO wrote to the state government to verify Dundi's claim. On May 17, the Odisha government directed the department concerned to study Dundi's project and send a report to the PMO.
 
 
 
 “I have created a transformer that can store the charge from the silicon plate. It will be a proud moment for me if the PMO appreciates my innovation,“ said Dundi.
 
 “Following demonetisation, I tried to discover the best possible way of using the banned notes. I tore up a note and found the silicon plate. From there, I started my research and succeeded in producing electricity ,“ he said, adding that it took him only 15 days to come up with the dynamics of the project.
 
 Dundi has so far demonstrated his project only in college. “When nobody took notice, I wrote to the Prime Minister and chief minister,“ he said. The son of a farmer, Dundi earns a living by making and selling bulbs.
