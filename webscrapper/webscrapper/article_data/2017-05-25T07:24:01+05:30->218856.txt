COIMBATORE:   a 43-year-old man on Wednesday for bludgeoning his ex-wife to death a month after she divorced him and got his   to her as alimony. 

 Investigators identified him as K Kannappan, of Vinayagarkovil Street, Panappatti, near Negamam. He married  , 35, 14 years ago. They have a 13-year-old son. 
 
 While Kannappan was a daily wage worker, Selvi took to farming on her husband's piece of land. 
 
 Police said Kannappan was a drunkard and used to pick up fights with his wife regularly. After a family dispute over property, the couple started living separately in 2009.
 
  Selvi then moved the   court II in Pollachi for divorce.
 
 A month ago, the court ruled in favour of Selvi and asked Kannappan to transfer the land to her name as alimony. Though the verdict didn't go down well with Kannappan, he handed over the land to Selvi, investigators said.
