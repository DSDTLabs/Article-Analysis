JAIPUR: By day, Shyamsunder   is a teacher of sociology at the Government Dungar College, Bikaner. After his teaching assignments at college, though, for over ten years now he has been leading a rich life, leading what he calls the `familial forestry' movement in   and  , among the hottest and most arid of India's districts. The 37-year-old won an award from the President of India for his efforts in 2012. Now, he has another achievement ­ he has managed to start budding on desert bush Zyzyphus nummularia, which grows about two metres high and spreads out, forming a thicket in desert soil.This is the source of the smaller variety of fruit called 'ber' ­ the dark pink little fruit that is sold with masala on the wayside in Jaipur and other cities. It has a large seed and a just a little pulp that is edible.

 Scientists had long expressed disbelief that this bush could be budded ­ where the bud and some epidermal tissue is added to a new root-stock to increase fruit yield. The stem of the bush is rather narrow, and budding would create what scientists call a “bottleneck“ effect, making the base of the plant too narrow to bear the load of the top, which could grow broader. Jyani, however, did not allow the skepticism of scientists from stopping his efforts. He went ahead and tried budding on a few bushes in his friend  's land in 2010. Now, the farmer has a rich crop of ber, lasuda and khejri.
 
 Lal told TOI, “The scientists told us that we must not attempt to drive a truck on a vehicle fitted with the wheels of a car. They said the `bottleneck issue' would ruin our plants. We did initially face some trouble, but we found ways around it. Today, the yield of the plants and the quality of the fruit surprise the very scientists who were initially skeptical.“
