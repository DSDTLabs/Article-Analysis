CHANDIGARH:   on Thursday submitted its charge sheet against jailed   (DSS) chief   and two doctors in connection with the castration of hundreds of followers inside the dera. The charge sheet was filed before the special CBI court in Panchkula which had earlier convicted Gurmeet of rape.

 The two doctors – Dr   and Dr M P Singh – have been charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and cheating.
 
 The dera chief was jailed in August last year after he was convicted of raping two of his women disciples. Dr M P Singh too is in judicial custody in connection with the violence that had erupted in Panchkula after Gurmeet was convicted, leading to the death of 36 dera followers in police firing.
 
 It was on December 23, 2014, that the Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered a CBI investigation into charges of forced castration of followers inside the dera after hearing a petition by Hans Raj Chauhan. He had claimed that he and some 400 other followers were allegedly castrated with the false hope that the emasculation would lead to realisation of God through Gurmeet. It was alleged that the castration was done by doctors working for the dera’s hospital.
 
 The dera lawyers have argued that the procedure was performed with the consent of the followers. They have also contended that castration is the first step towards voluntary gender change, which is permitted under Indian laws. The court has, however, held that there can’t be consent for emasculation and the performer or abettor of the act has committed an offence.
 
 Murder conspiracy next
 
 Besides castration, Gurmeet is also facing two cases of being part of a murder conspiracy. The cases relate to the murder of dera manager   and Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chatterpatti. Trial of both cases is in the final stage of hearing before the special CBI court at Panchkula.
