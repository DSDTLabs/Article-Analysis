Vadodara: A day after their police custody ended, suspended planning assistant engineer of Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) and graft accused R C Shah and his accomplice Chirag Patel applied for bail from sessions court here.

 Shah and Patel, who were arrested by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on July 19 for accepting a bribe of Rs 4 lakh from a Rajkot-based builder for granting him completion certificate, have requested bails on the grounds of innocence.
 
 In his bail application Shah told the court that the builder had complained to ACB to settle scores against him. Shah has alleged that the builder had not taken completion certificate in designated time after construction of the project was over therefore VUDA had asked him to pay renewal charges.
 
 The bail plea also states that approval process in VUDA have become online thus there are no possibilities of him meeting the builder for any procedures. Shah has also pointed out in his bail plea that all approvals in the complainant’s case were given by chief executive officer of VUDA Dr N K Meena and thus he had never come in contact with the builder.
 
 Regarding the allegations that he had hired Patel as his middleman, he has said that Patel is one of the many VUDA authorized architects and he was selected by a panel and not by him.
 
 On the other hand, Patel in his application has stated completely opposite of what has come forward in the complaint. He had never contacted anyone on anybody’s behalf for money, neither had he taken any money nor was any cash recovered from him by ACB.
 
 The bail applications will come up for hearing on Friday.
