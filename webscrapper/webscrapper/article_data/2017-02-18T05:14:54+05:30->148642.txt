CHENNAI: While applying for a Rs 4 lakh loan in 2008 for his daughter's  , Chennai-based Dawood never imagined he would be subjected to such harassment -not only was he forced to pay collateral when not required, but also received   and was allegedly manhandled by the bank officials.

 While banking rules say no collateral needs to be collected for a loan amount up to Rs 7.5 lakh, Dawood was forced to pay it. “My daughter received threat calls and I was asked to come to the bank branch concerned where they manhandled me in confine. This happened in October 2013 long before the start of the repayment schedule,“ he claimed, during an interaction on education loans with minister for finance and corporate affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal.
 
 Several banks are not even aware of the   and several of these rules are not displayed on the ministry's website either. Many banks are curtailing the repayment period to 3-5 years even though there is a 15-year repayment schedule. The first step is to raise awareness between the students and the banks, says legal advisor B Jagannathan.
 
 Dawood is only one of many who raised several complaints about education loan in the state.
 
 Divya, an engineering graduate who is now employed in an IT firm, said it was very difficult for her to get a loan as she was an orphan and the bank required account numbers of parents.
 
 “Banks demand bonafide certificates from colleges but most colleges provide it only after the student has enrolled in the institution, which means depositing a minimum amount for the first term. If we had the money , why would we apply for a loan,“ she asked.
