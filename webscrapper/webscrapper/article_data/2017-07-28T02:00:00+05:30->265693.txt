PATNA: The two constituents of   –   (RLSP) and   (HAM-S) – on Thursday promised full cooperation to  , who was sworn in as the chief minister of NDA government in the state.

 The first NDA government Nitish had led from November 2005 to June 2013 had only two coalition parties – the JD(U) and BJP, with the former enjoying the status of “bigger partner”.
 
 During the 2014 parliamentary elections, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and RLSP led by Union ministers   and  , respectively, had constituted the BJP-led NDA, while the HAM-S headed by its founder president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi joined the NDA during the 2015 assembly elections.
 
 As far as public perception is considered, the LJP was considered the stable ally of the BJP, but doubts were raised over the continuance of RLSP and HAM-S in the NDA. However, on Thursday, Kushwaha went on record saying, “We are a part of the Union government. I not only congratulate CM Nitish for returning to NDA, but also extend all possible support to the NDA government in the best interests of Bihar.”
 
 Similarly, after Nitish resigned from the post of CM of Grand Alliance, Manjhi hailed him for setting “highest standards of ethics in public life”.
 
 However, it would be interesting to see if Nitish accommodates the LJP, RLSP and HAM-S legislators in his council of ministers. State RLSP secretary general Satyapal Prasad Dangi said, “These matters would be discussed at the highest level involving all the alliance partners. At present, it can be explained only by our party president Upendra Kushwaha.”
