Bringing in the vibrancy of the festival of Lohri, Bharat Vikas Parishad hosted a party, Lohri Da Rang â€“ Nave Saal De Sangh. The entire venue had a feel of a village, complete with a mock well and a cot, that gave several clicking moments to the members. Several Punjabi numbers like Dil Leh Gayi Kudi Gujarat Di, Gud Nal Ishq Mitha made the members shake a leg. Several performances also marked the event. Sanjeev and Priti Khemka danced to   while Rakesh and Bawana Kalra dance to Main Toh Ainvaye Ainvaye. Gaurav and Bhawana Srivastava performed to   while Rohit and Simple Kapoor danced on Tenu Suit Suit Karda.
