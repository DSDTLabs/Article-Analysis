NEW DELHI: In three months, Rs 2 crore worth   have been stolen from the 12.6km   corridor.

 “Ever since its opening on 25 December, cases of   from the viaduct and ramp have been reported from certain pockets of this section. About 15 theft cases have been reported till date leading to loss of around 3,750 metre 25kv/33kv cables,” said the   Rail Corporation spokesperson.
 
 These   supply power to the stations (33KV cable) and to Kalindi Kunj depot for trains (25KV cables). The thefts have been reported on the ramp area of Kalindi Kunj depot, which is getting power feeder cables from two sources, Sarita Vihar RSS and Kalkaji Mandir RSS, the official added. “Other locations where thefts have been reported are Okhla Vihar Jasola Vihar Kalindi Kunj Okhla Vihar and Jamia Nagar,” he said. 
 
 The spokesperson explained that   has laid down two circuits for power supply, so that in case of any disruption in the first, second one could fulfil the demand. This is the reason why the metro services have not been affected, he said. However, he cautioned that if such thefts are not curbed and culprits nabbed, the stealing of second tier of cables may severely affect the normal services.
 
 “The reason thieves are able to cut these high power cables is the mechanism of earth coating on these cables which trips the power supply as soon as someone pierces these cables. Once tripped, the cable is cut easily with the help of different tools,” he said.
 
 DMRC said it is continuously making efforts to curb such thefts on these identified locations by deploying patrolling guards and is planning to raise the fence near ramp besides exploring the possibility of installing CCTVs on the theft prone points.
