Coimbatore: The state-wide   kick-started in the city on Wednesday with the participation of as many as 70 volunteers from various city-based NGOs. The two-day survey will cover 29 wetlands by 15 teams.

 “The volunteers along with forest staff will undertake the survey in wetlands from 6am to 9.30am and photograph the birds,” said N Satheesh, district forest officer, Coimbatore forest division. After the survey in wetlands, the team will conduct a similar survey in forests.
 
 All the volunteers were given an orientation on how to spot the birds and the entire survey methodology. “This survey takes place every January across the state. In many districts, the survey will take place inside sanctuaries and in some cities, in wetlands,” said a volunteer.
 
 Volunteers on Wednesday spotted several rare species, but they said the number of the birds has come down. “This could be because water has receded in many lakes as summer is setting in,” said a bird expert.
 
 Bird watcher Gajamohanraj said five volunteers were in-charge of Kumarasamy, Selvampathy, Krishnampathy, Narsampathy, Kolarampathy and Vedapatti pudhukulam. “Totally, we spotted 90 species on Wednesday including water cock, citrine wagtail, pintail snipe, yellow bittern, emerald dove and white wagtail,” he said. But he added that water birds were lesser in number this year.
 
 Since the survey takes place at all the locations at the same time, there will not be any repetitions, said Satheesh. He added that apart from identifying the species and recording their number, they would also award the best photograph.
 
 “The entire survey is being coordinated by several bird experts, organisations such as World Wildlife Fund, CUBE and OSAI, and others. The data will be compiled on Thursday evening and sent to the state forest department,” said an official.
