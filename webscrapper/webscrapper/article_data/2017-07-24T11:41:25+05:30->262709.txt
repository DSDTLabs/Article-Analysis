 After taking charge from De, he said, “The communication skill programme, in collaboration with the  , proved fruitful for the students from rural areas. Communication skill is very important for the students to get job in a good multinational company. It’s a problem area not only in Bihar but the entire northern belt. I will focus on such issues.”
 
 Tripathi told this correspondent he has sought a brief report from the senior institute officials on the ongoing development projects. “Tomorrow, I will meet with the deans and discuss the existing projects and the possible improvements. I am glad to know that the institute has got 125 acre land at   near Bihta for its new premises. We will soon start constructing boundary wall there,” he said.
 
 Tripathi further said, “I will focus on the plans already in the pipeline. I don’t believe in big talks.” 
 
 At a function to welcome Tripathi and farewell to De, the outgoing director recalled his five-year tenure and the development works, including the construction of three hostels, a guesthouse with 25 luxury rooms, 93 quarters for the institute staff, students’ activity centre, innovation-cum-incubation centre and Wi-Fi facility on the campus. He started new courses like MSc in physics, chemistry and mathematics, PhD courses, MTech in computer science, water resource and river engineering.
 
 De said the computer science building would be completed within a month. “There are many things that I wanted to do for this institute. But I regret that could not change the perception of non-Biharis about the institute,” said De, during whose tenure   were signed with foreign universities of Russia and South Korea.
