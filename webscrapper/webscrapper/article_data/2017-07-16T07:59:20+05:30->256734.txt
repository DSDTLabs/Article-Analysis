CHENNAI: With showers hitting the already delayed   work for replacing the   (LC-4) in  , the residents there are a miffed lot.

 Since the closure of the LC in 2013, residents have been facing a tough time — being forced to take long detours, spanning over 3km, just to cover a distance of 100m — and the school-going students are the hardest hit.
 
 “The work on the subway was going on considerably fine. But these days, it has become slow,” said a resident and a parent, N  . “There are a number of schools on the other side, including  , and for school-going kids, this affair has been strenuous. We are hoping to see the subway get ready as soon as possible,” she added.
 
 The project, which is being jointly carried out by the Southern Railway and the state government, was estimated to be completed at a cost of Rs 20 crore. Railway officials, when contacted, said only a few more days of work was remaining on the subway. “Railway work will be over in another 10 days. Approach road and the retaining wall is to be built by the state authorities after that,” said a senior divisional officer.
 
 But residents say that the work is far from over and that onset of showers would only slow it further. A visit to the site shows most work remaining in progress being flooded with water. Residents of many areas such as Srinivasapuram, Balaji Nagar and Lakshmi Nagar are affected by the slow progress.
