COIMBATORE: A   was allegedly hurled at a Hindutva activist’s sister’s house by miscreants at Malumichampatty on the outskirts of the city early Sunday morning. However, the police suspect foul play on the part of the activist as his request to provide personal security officers to his religious prayer hall was rejected by the police recently.

 Banumathi, wife of Balasubramaniam from Malummichampatti, was sleeping in her house when she smelt smoke coming near the main door. She opened the door and found the floor mat caught fire. She doused the fire and informed her neighbour G Uma Maheswari, 27. An empty bottle with smell of petrol mixed with diesel was found near the door.
 
 Banumathi’s family was staying in a rental house belonging to Uma Maheswari. Police said Uma Maheswari’s elder brother Shanmugasundaram, 39, of Malumichampatti was running a religious prayer hall in the name of ‘Nagasakthi Amman Dhyana Peetam’ in 15 cents of land from 2012. 
 
 Recently, Shanmugasundaram approached Chettipalayam police and senior police officials seeking to provide personal security officers (PSOs) for his prayer hall. But his request was denied by the police as he did not get any threat. On early Sunday morning, Shanmugasundaram informed Hindu outfits that his sister’s house was attacked with crude petrol bomb. 
 
 Police said Maheswari had fixed three CCTV cameras in the house. She told the police that the cameras were not functioning for the last three days. Sangeetha, assistant director of Mobile Forensic Laboratory, Coimbatore visited the crime scene and opined that the mat was douse with fuel. Police said a portion of floor mat was completely burnt. 
 
 Meanwhile, a few leaders from   (IMK- Thamizhagam) visited the spot and requested the police to take appropriate action against the culprits. Chettipalayam police said that they did not receive any complaint so far.
