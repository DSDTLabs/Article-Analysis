MADURAI:   deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam on Monday released water from Mullaperiyar dam to irrigate 14,707 acres of paddy cultivation in   in   district. Two hundred cusecs of water will be released for a period of 120 days to carry out cultivation.

 Every year, the water for cultivation in Cumbum valley used to be released on June 1 when Mullaperiyar water level is adequate.

The farming community has been making the demand to release water as the dam level crossed 120 feet recently.
 
 Based on their request, the public works department reviewed the water level and decided to release water for Cumbum valley in the first phase. Theni district administration also sent their recommendation. Based on the recommendation, the water release was scheduled for Monday.
 
 Panneerselvam released water in the presence of Theni district collector N Venkatachalam and PWD officials. Ahead of the release, rituals were conducted at the sluice in   and prayers were offered to Vanadurgai (Goddess Kali). As the water gushed out of the dam, floral tributes were offered.
 
 Water would be released for 120 days and the farming community should utilize it judiciously, said a statement from the PWD.
