COIMBATORE: Nearly 200 bullock carts took part in the   held at  , a suburb of the city, on Sunday. The race was organized by local farmers,   MLAs and the Rekla Club of Tamil Nadu. The participants said they had not held this race in such grandeur after the ban by Supreme Court. Kangeyam bull owners from Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode and Karur districts took part in the race.

 Held in two categories, 200 metres for the younger bulls and 300m in the open category, four carts were allowed to run each time. “This race was held as part of temple functions and Pongal festival celebrations. But after the ban, in some remote villages, the races continued but the number of participating bulls came down drastically,” said one of the participants. He added that he himself had sold two of his bulls as he could not take care of them. “Most of them who used to sell it up to a lakh were forced to sell it at throwaway rates,” he added.
 
 He said the race was held mainly to safeguard the Kangeyam breed. Due to the ban, the number of bulls in Pollachi and nearby areas had come down. Earlier, they used these bulls at farms and races. But now, most of them sold their bulls. “We may start buying Kangeyam bulls again and are hopeful that the numbers would increase now,” said a farmer.
