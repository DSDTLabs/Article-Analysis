GUNTUR: The   (GMC) is planning to construct air-conditioned city bus bays at all busy junctions. Buoyed with the success of the first   city   launched in   junction, the GMC has decided to go for similar projects across the city. 

 At least 10 more bus bays with all basic amenities, including clean toilets and seating facilities will be made available in the next 2-3 months.

The private player, which will invest in the construction, will be allowed to profit through billboards to be set up on the top of the bus bays.
 
 The city bus station will have at least 30-40 seats in the air-conditioned room. Mineral water and mobile charging facilities will also be available free of cost. The bus bay will also have an ATM. Reviewing the progress of city developmental works with all the senior officials late on Saturday night, district collector asked the engineering officials to put the road development works on a fast-track. He asked the GMC and R&B engineers to complete the main roads on priority basis. Nandivelugu road, Etukuru road, Koritapadu road,   road, Lalupuram road and Ponnur road would be completed in the first phase.
