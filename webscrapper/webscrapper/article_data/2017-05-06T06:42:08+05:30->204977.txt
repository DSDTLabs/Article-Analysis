INDORE: As part of the ongoing drive,   officials on Friday detected power theft in which consumer was drawing power through separate neutral line against his connection.

 Officials said that the consumer in   area had been using a single hot wire with an earth return to draw power. This was eventually helping him reduce consumption of power. The theft was detected due to difference in meter readings installed in transformer and consumer’s connection.
