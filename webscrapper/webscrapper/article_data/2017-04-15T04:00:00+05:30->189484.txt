Vadodara: The Gujarat Refinery (GR) will submit an action-taken report to the district collector on Saturday in connection with the notice issued to the company for causing the gas emission.  The refinery will mention all the steps it took to ensure that the gas emissions that allegedly happened from its flare stack are stopped.  “We have plugged all the possible faults in our system and hence a report will be submitted to the collector,” said GR executive director, Sudhir Kumar. The refinery authorities have also invited the special committee that was formed to inquire into the gas stench on Saturday. “We have asked the committee consisting of Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and M S University professors to visit the refinery premises again. The committee will be shown all the steps taken by us to prevent any gas emission,” Kumar told TOI. “We have been blamed for the gas emission so it is our responsibility to come clean. I will also try to meet the GPCB chairman to present our point of view,” he added. The GPCB had issued a notice to GR after their inquiry revealed that the gas emission occurred from the refinery. The inquiry said that there was some fault in GR’s flare stack that caused the gas emissions. GPCB has given the refinery management 15 days to improve its system.  Barodians had been facing severe gas stench over last few days causing panic in some areas. The GPCB team had visited several industries and taken air samples to find out the source of gas emission.
