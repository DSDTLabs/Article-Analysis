UDUPI: Out of two horses at Krishna Temple which were brought from Tamil Nadu, one died in an accident on Sunday. The accident took place at Gundi Bailu, Kunjibetu, Udupi. Like every day, the caretaker Krishna, had taken the horse out for a ride, when it unexpectedly hit the divider and fell down. 

 The injured horse was immediately brought back to its stable at the mutt and treated. However, it died within an hour. The caretaker survived the accident with minor injuries. Krishna was given special training to look after these horses.
 
 These two horses had replaced Subhadra (elephant) at the Krishna Temple last year on February 29. Chennai businessman  , a devotee of paryaya swamiji, had donated these horses to Krishna mutt. Sri Vishwa Prasanna Theertha Swamiji (junior pontiff) of Pejawar mutt had taken the responsibility of these horses.
 
 He said that the horses are not temple property and it was given to senior pontiff Vishvesha Theertha swamiji of Pejawar mutt. Hence, after paryaya term of   gets over, if the next paryaya swamiji is ready to maintain the horses, it will continue to be at Krishna mutt. If not, it will be taken to   at Pejawar.
