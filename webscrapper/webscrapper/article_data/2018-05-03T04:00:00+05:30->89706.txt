Surat: A pilot project on public bicycle sharing to provide last mile connectivity to people is likely to kick off from Athwalines to Dumas resort in the city on June 25.  A person living in Piplod village and working in an office on Ring Road can take a shared autorickshaw to Athwalines and then pick up a bicycle from the public bike sharing pit of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) and reach home within 15 minutes. The Athwalines-Dumas resort road, one of the busiest in the city, has traffic density of 6,000 passenger car units (PCU) per hour.  A major portion of the 200-feet wide road would be reserved for the cycle track. “Before starting bicycle sharing project in the walled city, the experiment here would provide us an idea how acceptable this mode of transport is to the people,” SMC deputy municipal commissioner Rajesh Pandya said.  SMC plans to set up eight stops on Athwalines to Dumas resort from where people can get at least 300 bicycles which they can deposit them at a nearby pit close to their destination. “Majority of working class people would be able to use this mode of transport free because no charge needs to be paid for the first half of the ride,” faculty member of transportation systems department, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Technology, Professor Gaurang Joshi said.  Public bicycle sharing project would do wonders on this road as you will have people who would want to ride a bicycle either for fun or health reasons. There would also be people who want to reach their destination a few kilometres away, but can’t afford any transport and hence the bicycles would be of great help to them on a road which does not have much of a public transport.
