MUMBAI: In response to a petition filed by an unwed mother,   submitted in Bombay high court it has no authority to issue a birth certificate without the biological father's name though it is duty-bound to register births and deaths. 

 The 31-year-old petitioner from   had given birth to a daughter in August 2016 through test tube process with sperms obtained from a donor. Her petition said she is not interested in disclosing the name of the sperm donor and she does not want to be compelled to do so either. She urged the HC to direct the ward office to issue a birth certificate without mentioning the father's name.
 
 Her petition cited the 2015 SC judgment which directed that if a single or unwed mother applies for a birth certificate and files an affidavit, it must be issued without insisting on the biological father's name.
 
 On Thursday, BMC's advocate   told a bench of justices Abhay Oka and Riyaz Chagla the "birth record of the child bears the father's name." He submitted an affidavit of the sub-registrar (births & deaths) of 'P' North ward. It stated a birth report form from the hospital where the child was born bears the signature of the mother with the father's name mentioned and the woman shown as his wife. The sub-registrar thereafter registered the child's birth. 
 
 The affidavit said in December 2017 the woman sent a legal notice to the sub-registrar. Subsequently, BMC called for the medical papers from the hospital. These too state she is married to the biological father. The sub-registrar said the legal notice sought to restrain the authorities from disclosing/reflecting the father's name. However, the affidavit states the sub-registrar is not empowered to do so.
 
 The bench said it will pass an order similar to the one passed in a recent case where it directed BMC to issue a birth certificate to a three-year-old without including her father's name.
