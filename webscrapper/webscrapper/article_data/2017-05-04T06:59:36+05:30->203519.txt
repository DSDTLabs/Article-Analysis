THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   (KSRTC) took a tough stand by suspending 68 mechanical staff who failed to report to duty on Wednesday. The suspended staff belong to regional workshop in   of KSRTC who did not turn up for work in protest against the modified duty pattern of mechanical staff. 

 The unit officers were directed to inform about the staff who failed to report for duty and participated in the protest following the direction of KSRTC management. The management had warned that strict action, including termination from service, will be taken against staff and empaneled staff, if they failed to report on duty.
 
 Around 4,000 buses were operated by KSRTC with 77% of mechanical staff reporting for duty on Wednesday. The department could operate only 3,000 buses on Tuesday due to the protest. 
 
 Of the 709 mechanical staff, 551 employees reported for duty on Wednesday.
 
 "Directives were given to suspend those staff who failed to appear for duty. As the transport minister had suggested, after one month to the implementation of the modified duty pattern, any practical grievances of the staff will be considered. If the staff continue protest, strict action will be taken. With the protest, KSRTC's revenue dipped to Rs 5 crore on Tuesday," said KSRTC MD M G Rajamanickam.
 
 The trade unions had called-off the protest on Tuesday, after transport minister   promised them to review the modified duty pattern in a month into its implementation.Chandy said that corruption looms over the debt-ridden transport corporation.
 
 "There is corruption in KSRTC. Even before the traffic signal changes, the private buses take over the   buses and fly away with all the passengers. While the private bus operators run services with profit, KSRTC seeks loan from banks," said Chandy. 
 
 He added that he has requested support from finance minister for payment of salary and pension to KSRTC staff for this month.
