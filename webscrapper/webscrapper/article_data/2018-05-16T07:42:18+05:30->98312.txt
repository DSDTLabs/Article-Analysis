NEW DELHI:   has   the   in the case of the   who was   from outside his school in   a day before Republic Day this year. The prime accused, Nitin, had abducted the child to revive his business.

 
 The chargesheet was filed before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ajay Garg at Karkardooma courts earlier this month. The accused were booked for kidnapping, attempt to murder, theft, wrongful restraint and under provisions of Arms Act.
 
 The boy was rescued after a shootout at an apartment in Ghaziabad where one of the kidnappers, Ravi, was shot dead. Two others, Pankaj and Anshul Malhotra, were arrested. Nitin was arrested from Seemapuri on February 5 when he was returning from a marriage party. Police were keeping a tab on his movements and had even entered the wedding venue posing as guests.
 
 Nitin had connived with the others to carry out the kidnapping after he found that the child’s father had received a large sum of money from a debtor. He used to procure raw materials for his eatery from the shop owned by the child’s father. He had demanded a ransom of Rs 60 lakh, said the chargesheet. Probe also revealed that Nitin used to make the ransom calls in a woman’s voice to hoodwink police.
 
 Malhotra had procured the arms used for kidnapping the child from a supplier in UP. Pankaj and Ravi had abducted the boy from his school bus after shooting the driver, Naresh Thapa.
 
 The 43-page chargesheet has listed 81 witnesses and cited that stolen mobile phones were used by the accused to make the ransom calls and send a WhatsApp video of the boy saying “I love you” to his father. CCTV footage showing the men fleeing with the child have been put up as evidence. Nitin’s voice sample was also sent for analysis.
 
 The operation to rescue the child was called “C-River” as the accused had demanded that the ransom money be delivered at Cross River mall.
