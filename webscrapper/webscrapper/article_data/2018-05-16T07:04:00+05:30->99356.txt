GREATER NOIDA: In a meeting with officials of UP government and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Jewar   Dhirendra Singh on Monday demanded   compensation to the   for land acquired for the   airport.

 
 Speaking on behalf of the farmers, the MLA said, “Apart from being a source of livelihood, the land is like a fixed deposit for the farmer and his children. It also determines his status in the community. Hence a fair   should be given to the farmers whose land is being acquired for the Jewar airport.”
 
 Later, while apprising chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Singh said that the Jewar airport will not only bring development to the area but also benefit the entire state. However, he maintained that the airport should not be a cause of grievance for the farmers of the area. “Though employment generation and opportunities will be available to the young with the coming up of the airport at Jewar, the farmers of the area also need to be taken care of in a fair manner, which means just compensation in lieu of their land,” said Singh. Present on the occasion included Anup Chandra Pandey infrastructure and industrial development commissioner (IDC), S P Goyal principal secretary to the chief minister, Amit Singh OSD and more.
