GANDHINAGAR: India and Africa, both being   regions, can do a lot in promoting   in the African continent, said experts during a session on ‘Creating Wealth through Fashionomics’.

 Deliberating on possibilities that can be explored to boost fashion industry in Africa, Celestin Monga of African Development Bank said that there is huge potential in the sub-Saharan countries. “Africa is a leading manufacturer of cotton and sourcing the raw material from these countries can help the fashion industry bloom in the continent,” he said. “Like the traditional garment business in Gujarat, African apparel, too, can be promoted to become a major fashion statement. However, to achieve this, funding and direction are required,” said Monga.
 
 “Growth in the fashion industry of Africa can be made possible through increased FDI (foreign direct investment), education and skill development,” added Helen Hai,   Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) goodwill ambassador for industrialization in Africa, and CEO of the ‘Made in Africa’ initiative.
