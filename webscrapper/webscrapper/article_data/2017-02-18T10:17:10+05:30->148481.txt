GAYA: The four-day special drive, jointly launched by the railways and police to evict squatters and other encroachers, ended on Thursday. Assistant divisional engineer  , who led the drive, claimed that altogether 550 illegal occupants of railway land and residential quarters were evicted.

 The massive drive was simultaneously conducted in areas like Inspector Colony, Marshalling Yard, Loco Colony, Kharkhura and level crossing number 1. Temporary as well as permanent encroachments were targeted during the drive.
 
 Seth said about 50 khatals were also removed from the railway land. Vegetable and fruit vendors, who had occupied the land near level crossing number 1, were also evicted.
 
 “The first such drive began a few months back and in several phases, 150   have been evicted. In order to prevent fresh round of trespassing and quarter grabbing, the freed units have either been allotted to genuine claimants or sealed,” Seth said, adding the remaining quarters would shortly be allotted to railway employees. “Altogether 25 dilapidated residential units have also been demolished. A survey is being conducted to identify more dilapidated structures,” Seth added.
 
 Seth did not rule out the possibility of taking penal action against the usurpers of railway property. “Support of civil and police officials is required for initiating penal action against the encroachers,” he said.
 
 According to insiders, more than 1,500 railway quarters were built about 100 years back. However, due to poor maintenance, waterlogging and ruthless subletting of the facilities, most of these quarters have become unliveable.
 
  functionary   alleged that in most cases, the encroachments were made in connivance with local railway officials. Such encroachments fell in the category of ‘encroachment by consent’, he said. “Subletting of the facilities by original allottees was very common and railways should come down heavily on internal saboteurs,” Moosa added.
