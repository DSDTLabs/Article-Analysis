NEW DELHI: Questioning what it called a “delay” by EC, Delhi   chief   alleged on Sunday that   was acting at the behest of the ruling   government. He said the “delay” had helped AAP in sending three members to Rajya Sabha. “What has transpired between December 22 and January 19? Why the decision couldn’t be made before December 22,” asked Maken. “The BJP doesn’t want to demolish AAP beyond a point.”

 The party also slammed AAP for claiming that the MLAs were not given time to present their case. He tweeted 11 hearing dates given by EC in the office-of-profit matter. “They had got enough opportunity to present their side. Half of their cabinet has been charged with corruption charges. Now, 20 MLAs have been disqualified. He (Kejriwal) should take moral responsibility and resign,” he added.
 
 Delhi Congress has planned a protest march against the AAP government on Monday, from DPCC office to the Delhi Secretariat, demanding the CM’s resignation.
 
 The development has created fertile conditions for the Congress to reach out to the electorate and revive the party in the state which it ruled for 15 years. In 2015, the party had suffered a massive blow as it was routed in Delhi. At present, the party doesn’t have any representation in the 70-member Delhi assembly. In the two bypolls held in 2016, it had failed to open its account.
 
 The party has already started preparations for the bypolls. “We are ready for the bypolls. We will hold assembly-wide meetings from January 27,” said Maken.
