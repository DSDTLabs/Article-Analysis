With ‘Kaabil’ all set to release this month,   has his hands full with promotional rounds. The actor, who is hoping the film strikes a chord with the audiences, says that he had lots of fun working on a project. Speaking to a daily, he said, “‘Kaabil’ will look physically difficult and like I’ve worked very hard but it’s my easiest role. When work comes from passion and enthusiasm, it becomes fun. I’ve had most fun in this film.”
The talented star is also on a high after being featured in the sexiest men’s lists. He said, “It’s just a compliment, not an achievement. Beauty is not about your nose and where your jawline is. It’s the sequence of your self-expression — how an actor comes across, his behaviour in normal life, how he speaks, his body language. Also, how good one makes others feel.”
 Discussing his choice of roles over the past couple of years — he was seen in ‘Bang Bang’ and ‘Mohenjo Daro’ — he says that doing ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’ was harder. “It wasn’t an author-backed role, and the entire film was in a lighter vein — you just have to let things flow. I’m glad I got to experience that world of cinema that I love so much. I look forward to doing more such films, especially with someone like  . I am aware of the talks about the sequel to Zoya’s film. I think I have to call her once more and say, ‘Please write something and if you think I’m good enough, please take me in your film.’ I guess I’ll have to beg her. The sequel will happen, maybe in three to four years.”
