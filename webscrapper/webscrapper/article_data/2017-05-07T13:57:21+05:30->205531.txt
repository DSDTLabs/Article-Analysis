PANAJI: Rumder lake was a healthy ecosystem with a stretch of highly-productive community fields, used as a post-monsoon storage for agro-fishery and a habitat for the rich biodiversity before the western bypass dissected it.

 River Sal is a lifeline for villages from Verna, Nuvem, Majorda and Betalbatim to Benaulim, Varca and  . “The fields along its banks are like a contiguous wetland and they help the groundwater recharge in these areas,” a villager said.
 
 “The gates for storage would be closed on September 22 every year after paddy harvest, as per the code of comunidade,” says  , a local resident.
 
 During October-March, the fish in the lake would grow on harvested field stubble and microorganisms till summer. Post-monsoon, farmers would grow chillies, vegetables drawing water from the ponds and by summer, they would harvest fish. “This is exactly how our fields produced fish, curry and rice,” gushes Fernandes.
 
 But, he laments that they have lost their paddy fields, riverine ecosystem and the coconut groves are also dying.
 
 Sunil Keshkamat, an elderly villager had petitioned the central government in 2013, pleading that the project be dropped as it would be environmentally-disastrous. “The site, a fragile ecosystem, consists of fields, wetlands, and is a hub of rich biodiversity and wildlife corridor for several endangered species of wildlife,” she wrote.
 
 Goa state biodiversity board had suggested some measures to improve the road and landscape engineering to prevent further degradation.
 
 Most farming activities have shown a decline, partly due to the project’s adverse impact and general decline in agriculture. “We need the young brigade to carry on the traditions,” Fernandes said.
