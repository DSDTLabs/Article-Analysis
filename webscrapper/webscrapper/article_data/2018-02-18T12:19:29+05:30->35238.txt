AJMER: Girl students of Government Mahila Engineering College on Saturday went on strike and staged protest against hike in fees of B.Tech courses. Angry girls blocked the   road for more than two hours and police was deputed to control the situation. Girls shouted slogans against state government and said that it is not Beti Bachao Beti Padhao but it is   per Bhar Badao (save daughter and put burden on their fathers).

 Girls said that if fee hike decision is not taken back, they will vote against BJP in coming assembly elections. Hundreds of girls came out of campus and blocked the road as they were angry when they came about the fees hike.
 
 “More than 80% of girls are studying on education loan as our parents are not rich,” said Ankit Lahotiya, a student.
 
 Another student Sujata said that in 2007, fees of B.Tech was Rs 8,000 and now they have to pay Rs 90,000.
 
 “By the time students will pass, they have to pay Rs 6 lakh,” added another student. Girls said that their parents are not rich and therefore they are in government engineering college on education loan.
 
 Girls accused that about six months ago, when higher education minister   visited their college, she promised no hike in fee structure.
 
 Girls said, it is better to do bachelor of education than to pursue technical education.
 
 Some faculty members also supported the strike and said that it is unfortunate that government backed out from its promise.
 
 “Chief minister Vasundhara Raje when inaugurated this college promised that parents will not be bothered about their daughters but now fees has been hiked,” said a faculty.
 
 Principal   said that she requested girls to attend classes and said that he is having extra charge of the college and wanted he should be relived.
