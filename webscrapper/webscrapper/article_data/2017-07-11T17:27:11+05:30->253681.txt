 The fresh delay in the appointment of a coach comes 47 days after the BCCI invited applications for the role. "What we have decided is that we will hold on for the time being (on) the announcement of the coach.

 Ganguly made it clear that they are looking at the bigger picture for the next two years and will take a decision in the best interest of Indian cricket.
