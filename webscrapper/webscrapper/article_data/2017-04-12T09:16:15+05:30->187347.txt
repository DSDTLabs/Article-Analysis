LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: Taking its second biggest decision since coming to power, the   government on Tuesday decided to 
  and gave nod to an agreement with the Centre to ensure 24X7 power supply by October 2018. 

 The MoU between UP and the Centre would be signed in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union power minister  .
 
 This was decided in the second cabinet meeting of the Adityanath government in Lucknow on Tuesday. 
 
 After the meeting, UP energy minister   told reporters that the surcharge waiver would cost the state exchequer around Rs 3,500 crore.
 
 Also, in a first, the UP government has decided to purchase potatoes directly from farmers to cut wastage of the crop due to shortage of cold storages.
 
 Coming in support of the UP government, the Centre approved 
  in the state under the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) during 2016-17 crop year (July-June). 
 
 The approval is in tune with the UP cabinet’s decision to procure potatoes so that the farmers are not forced to sell it at throwaway prices in summer.
 
 The purchase will be made at Rs 4,870 per MT. The agriculture ministry will provide an additional Rs 1,217.50 per MT for overhead expenses. 
 
 After the cabinet meeting, energy minister Shirkant Sharma told reporters that the price would save the farmers from incurring any loss.
 
 The move comes days after the UP government’s decision to waive farm loan of small and marginal farmers and speed up wheat procurement drive at MSP in the state. 
 
 In another decision, the government gave nod to short-term mining policy, allowing district magistrates to give permits for mining for a limited period to plug the shortfall of sand and building material. 
 
 The permit, to be given in 10 days, will be issued through e-tendering, health minister and UP government spokesman   said.
