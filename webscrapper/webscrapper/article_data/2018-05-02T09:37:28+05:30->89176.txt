RAIPUR: Chhatisgarh police on Tuesday found that   killed an anganwadi worker in Kondagaon district and strung her body on a tree as a warning to avenge   encounter, in which 39 rebels were gunned down on April 22. 

 Police have found that a band of Maoists went to   village in Kondagaon on the night of April 23 and singled out 20-year-old Parwati Korram simply because her cellphone ringtone was 'Bastar police ki jai'.
 
 She was allegedly dragged to the middle of the clearing in front of her home, beaten up mercilessly in public, strangled and her body then hung from a tree. Locals told security personnel that the Maoists called it the beginning of the retaliation for the   encounter and warned them against speaking to police.
 
 Villagers buried Parwati's body and kept mum until a patrol party stumbled upon the gory act of reprisal during a search operation on Tuesday. Police have sought SDM's permission to exhume her body for investigation.
 
 Police said the rebels called the villagers out of their homes on the night of April 23 and started checking everyone's cellphone. 
 
 'One of them found that Parwati had the Kondagaon police ringtone. Then, they spotted the contact number of an alleged 'gopniya sainik' (police informer) on her contacts list.
