NEW DELHI:   is on a comeback trail having been struck by injury and disciplinary issues over the past year, but recent results bode well for the young boxer who will be a top medal prospect for India as he makes his debut at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast City, Australia. 
 
 
 
 
 Vikas tasted success early in his career when he returned home with a gold and bronze medal from the 2010 Youth World Amateur Boxing Championships and Youth Olympics respectively. In the same year, he furthered his reputation with a gold medal at the Asian Games.
 
 Vikas made it to the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 20 but lost in the quarter-finals after a video review of the bout. A jolted Vikas took a break from boxing to join the Haryana Police and remained away from the ring for 18 months. When he returned, success didn't come easy as earlier but he did win a bronze medal at the 2014 Asian Games. At the Asian Boxing Championships in 2015, he lost in the final to Zhanibek Alimkhanuly of Kazakhstan to settle for silver.
 
 At the Rio Olympics, Vikasâ€™ journey, like his previous appearance at the Summer Games, came to an end in the quarters where he lost to Bektemir Melikuzeiv of Uzbekistan in the 75kg category.
 
 
 
 However, at the Asian Championships in 2017, he forfeited his middleweight category (75kg) semi-final bout giving a walkover to his Korean opponent Lee Dongkyun. He came in the tournament as favourite but took bronze owing to a forfeiture and then had to face a disciplinary committee explaining his actions. Weight issues and a hand injury further hampered him during the year.
 
 
 
  
 
 But 2018 has begun well for the 26-year-old, who clinched a gold medal at the Strandja Memorial Tournament in Bulgaria and became the first Indian to be adjudged as the best boxer at the event.
