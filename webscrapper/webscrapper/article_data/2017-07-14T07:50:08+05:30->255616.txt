HYDERABAD: Ruling   B Shankar Nayak needs to be booked under the Nirbhaya Act for his inappropriate behaviour with   district collector Preeti Meena, the   said, demanding The TRS immediately suspend the MLA. 

 TDP state unit working president A   on Thursday said TDP would not let the matter rest unless the TRS   was booked under the Nirbhaya Act and jailed. 
 
  "Instead of ensuring that a case is filed against the MLA under non-bailable sections, the CM is more concerned about brokering a deal through middlemen and pacifying the collector," he said. "It does not make sense that the guilty MLA just walks into a police station, stays for two minutes, signs a document and gets to leave on bail," the TDP leader said referring to Nayak being given 'station bail'.
