MYSURU: Determined to win in  , the state   has adopted Uttar Pradesh’s assembly election strategy of using social media to organise booth level workers. It has created separate WhatsApp accounts for every booth in a constituency, through which the party high command is directly collecting feedback from workers and sending instructions. 

 “In order to strengthen the party at the booth level, WhatsApp groups have been formed which will be monitored by the state IT cell of the party,” a leader said. “National and state leaders will collect details of all the developments from party’s grassroots level workers and directions will be given on the group.”
 
 The party has also devised separate codes for each booth. The constituencies or booths which are favorable for parties will be marked ‘A +’, while constituency where there is a 50-50 chance of winning is marked ‘B +’. Areas dominated by minority and backward classes will be marked ‘C +’. 
 
 BJP leaders believe that communicating directly with party workers will not only boost the morale of workers, but will also help the party get updates on ground realties and whether a candidate can win. “Based on the interaction in social media, the party’s high command can make changes in their strategy to win the election,” leader said.
