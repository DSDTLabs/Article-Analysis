I found the video clippings in a pen drive and documents with the transcription,” Singh said while playing the video clips at a news conference. 

 While the man’s face was not clearly visible, his voice was also not distinct in many places. However, Singh claimed, “It is a clear confession of the crime Tytler has committed during the  .” Tytler told TOI that the video was fake. “The person in the video clip is not me, it’s not my voice either. They have doctored the video,” he claimed. Tytler also threatened to take Singh to court over the issue. 
 
 Following the release of the alleged  , BJP national secretary Sardar R P Singh lodged an FIR at Parliament Street police station against Tytler. Singh, who is also the Delhi president of Shiromani Akali Dal, demanded immediate arrest of Tytler, failing which DSGMC would launch protests. Singh said he would hand over the clippings to CBI.
 
 He will also write to Prime Miniter Narendra Modi, CBI and several other agencies about them. “If the investigating agencies take a closer look at the video clippings, the role of Tytler in the riots will be unearthed,” Singh said. Demanding a lie-detector test on Tytler, he said SAD MPs would raise the issue in the ongoing session of Parliament.
 
 Tytler has been accused of instigating the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 and taking part in it following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. However, no charge has been proved so far.
