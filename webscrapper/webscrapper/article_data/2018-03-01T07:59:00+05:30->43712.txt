Chandigarh: A 45-year-old man committed suicide by jumping before a train as he was upset over alleged sexual abuse and harassment of her teenaged daughter by four persons, including a woman, in a village under Assandh sub-division of Karnal district. 
 
 The victim jumped before the train on Tuesday evening. In a suicide note recovered from him, he had blamed four persons of harassing and blackmailing his teenaged daughter. The Government Railways Police (GRP) has started investigations after registering a case of abetment to suicide and criminal intimidation at GRP police station in Karnal. The case has been registered on the complaint of victim’s elder brother. According to information, the victim and his family lived in a rented accommodation of one of the accused. 
  
 The accused allegedly lured his daughter into a relationship and later blackmailed and abused her. The four accused even forced her to pay Rs 19,000, which she deposited in the bank account of one of them. It is alleged that for the past three months the three had been blackmailing her. She finally lodged a complaint at the Karnal women police station but was forced to withdraw it following pressure mounted by the accused and their families. 
  
 According to the suicide note, initially the accused had stopped harassing but last week one of them visited his house and threatened his daughter again. As he could not tolerate the insult, he decided to end his life, the note mentioned. 
  
 Officials of the GRP confirmed the suicide note found from the victim’s body. “We have sent the suicide note and bank receipt for examination. Police parties are conducting raids to arrest the accused,” the investigating officer of GRP police station in Karnal said.
