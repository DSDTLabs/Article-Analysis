Ahmedabad: A team of Vastrapur police have caught a couple for blackmailing a senior citizen with his compromising photographs and videos. Police have started an investigation to determine whether the duo is involved in more blackmailing cases. According to investigators, Chimanlal (name changed), 70, a resident of Vastrapur, had started getting text messages offering friendship. He responded to one of the messages after which a woman, identified as Sonia, began calling him. The two later began to meet. A fortnight ago, she came to his office and secretly captured photographs and videos of him in a compromising position.

 “Afterwards, Sonia, now identified as Sonia Gohel and her husband Nayan, started calling him, threatening to make the photos and videos public,” said an investigator. “They demanded Rs 7 lakh for not doing so. Chimanlal chose to confide in his family and then approached police.” 
 
 The duo was apprehended on the basis of the phone number. “We have learnt that Nayan worked with a private firm and earned a meagre salary,” said a Vastrapur police official. “Thus, the duo devised the plan and had started sending messages primarily to senior citizens. We have seized their mobile phones.” The is the third incident in recent past in which a senior citizen has filed a complaint of blackmail. “We encourage citizens to come out so that potential victims can be saved,” said a police official.
