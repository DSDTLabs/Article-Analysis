GURUGRAM: In a big relief to animals in Aravalis, the   filled up five water holes, each measuring about two-three feet, in the forest areas on Saturday with help of  . The process had begun from April 26, and the water tankers are sent to the forest areas from last Monday.

 MCG has dedicated a water tanker with a storage capacity of 5,000 litres to fill up these water holes. This will be done every alternate week, sources told TOI.
 
 MD Sinha, conservator of forests, Gurgaon circle, told TOI, “When departments work in synergy, good work is done on an immediate basis. Though the work is not complete yet, it would help the survival of  . We have also been witnessing an increase in the presence of wildlife around the water holes that have been filled recently.” 
 
 The initiative was taken after a jackal looking for water in sludge was spotted on April 26 by the forest department. Besides, the evidence started pouring in that wildlife animals, particularly leopards, have started venturing to unhabituated areas around the Aravalis looking for water.
 
 “Not only sightings of leopard, hyenas and jackals have increased in villages around the Aravalis, pugmarks of various wild animals have also been spotted, suggesting that animals are going down the hills in search of water. This calls for an urgent need to fill the water holes in the forest area,” Sinha said.
 
 “We are trying to fill as many water pits as possible in a day, which will be a success only if departments will work in close coordi-nation,” said an official of the MCG.
 
 There are more than two dozens of water pits along the   stretch in forest areas of Bandhwari, Mangar, Abhayapur, Khori, Damdama and Rithoz. 
 
 A 30-km linear forest stretch starting from Bandhwari to Damdama acts as a wildlife corridor between Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in Delhi and Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan.
