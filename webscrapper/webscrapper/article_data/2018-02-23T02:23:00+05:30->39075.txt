Vijayawada: The initiative of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) to clear about 3 lakh tonnes   piled up at Excel plant dumping yard in Ajit Singh Nagar has hit a roadblock in terms of delay due to slow pace of   work. The work, which started in the first week of December, has yet to gain momentum.

 The VMC has stopped dumping garbage at Ajit Singh Nagar after a series of agitations by and is planning to clear the trash scientifically. The civic body, which is drawing a flak on burning garbage, has decided to clear the piled up garbage using biomining. 
 
 Minister for information technology and panchayat raj Nara Lokesh laid the foundation for the project on December 7 last year. Zigma Global Environmental Solutions, an Erode-based agency which won the bid, had cleared about 3 acres for deployment of machinery.“Biomining of dumping yard is a prestigious project for city and we are focused on completing it on time. The agency is clearing 10 tonnes of garbage per day at present and is waiting for additional machinery to speed up the work,” VMC chief engineer Adiseshu said. Combustible and non-combustible wastes will be separated. Later, combustible material would be sent to industries and used as alternative fuel, he added.
 
 While opposition parties are seriously opposing the slow pace of works, VMC is focusing more on publicity than completing works, alleged CPI city secretary Donepudi Shankar. The civic body, which had started the biomining project a few months ago with much fanfare, has ignored the work. Going by the present pace of work, it might take a decade to complete it, he added.
 
 The residents of Ajit Singh Nagar demand that the VMC speed up the biomining work as the civic body has proposed to take up an affordable housing project there.
