CHHAPRA: With the inspection of   (GM)   on Saturday, passengers at   are hopeful to get three additional platforms, one more gate from northern side and many other amenities by the end of the next fiscal. However, introduction of passenger trains beyond Mashrakh and up to Gorakhpur via Thawe and Captainganj is expected in the first week of March.

 The GM, after inspecting the local stations and Chhapra-Thawe gauge conversion, said the work has been completed and the chief safety commissioner is likely to inspect the track beyond Mashrakh in the first week of March. “Thereafter, passenger trains will be extended beyond Mashrakh and up to Gorakhpur on this route,” he said.

Likewise, Chhapra Junction has been overloaded with the movement of about 172 passenger and express trains either passing or originating from here. There are only four functional platforms which are unable to cope with the load causing frequent stoppages at nearby stations like Gautam Asthan(Chhapra-Varanasi section), Tekniwas (Chhapra-Siwan section) and   (Chhapra-Sonepur section).
 
 The GM also inspected Chhapra station and expressed his anguish over non-functioning of different coach indication display boards, electronic reservation boards and directed the officials concerned to make them functional. He directed the officials to maintain cleanliness in waiting halls and dormitory. He also directed the officials to make unreserved tickets available for different destinations at Chhapra Kutchery station. At Chhapra, a delegation of   (MST) passengers handed over a memorandum to him demanding change in the timing of Phulwaria-Hajipur passenger train to enable them attend school, colleges and offices. 
 
 At Mashrakh, the GM expressed his displeasure over ill-maintenance of platform, passenger shed, fire extinguishing apparatus etc and warned the employees.
