Ahmedabad: Apples drawn in the 18th century by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, a French painter, are still the freshest fruits in art history. Chardin presented ordinary apples like artefacts, suggesting that beauty can be found on the kitchen table. We see that beauty when we pull down the curtain of preconceptions from our mind to let in the light of awareness. Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty — the Patiala-Kasur Gharana grandee — who performed on Monday at   — intensified that light.

 
 “I presented Chandrakauns, which many believe is ordinary,” Pandit Chakrabarty told TOI. “I don’t accept that. Ordinary flowers offered with respect and affection can seem like an exotic bouquet.” Panditji sets for himself the challenge to never repeat a raga at festivals. He always wins. “With so many artists performing at Saptak, the raga choice is difficult,” he said. “I picked Chandrakauns because it had not been rendered.” In the end, Panditji’s tour de force not only tore the curtain of preconceptions but perhaps also widened the vista of rasikas’ understanding.
 
 
 On Monday, Saptak evoked another allusion to painting. “When people marvel at Mona Lisa, they don’t count the number of brush stokes,” Ayaan Ali Bangash told TOI. He was alleviating the nervousness of inexperienced listeners. “We played Des which can be enjoyed as an appealing combination of notes. Those who wish to, can learn the intricacies of ragas.” Ayaan — who performed with his brother Amaan — deals with limelight just as naturally as people deal with daylight. In that respect Ayaan is like his father, sarod divinity Ustad Amjad Ali Khan.
 
 
 “What matters the most is the love of people,” Ayaan said. “That lies beyond the craft and musical fireworks.” The Bangash brothers delivered the fireworks and the venue brimmed with rasikas’ affection. The great ustad should be proud.
