Chennai: City-based knowledge tech company Disprz (formerly Learntron) has raised $2.6 million in a series A round. The round was led by IL&FS Private Equity along with existing investor Kae Capital. Founded in 2015 by Subramanian Viswanathan and Kuljit Chada, Disprz offers an employee development and engagement platform through a SaaS model for enterprises to leverage and deliver knowledge to employees in a personalised manner. “We have proven that sales and customer service can be substantially improved when you use a certain ‘intelligence’ in delivering knowledge to employees in a personalized, engaging and gamified way. We bring the latest trends in modern workforce learning and engagement like micro-learning, gamification, ‘chat-based learning’ and AI-based recommendations into a single unified platform,” said cofounder and CEO Subramanian Viswanathan.

 Disprz counts Naspers, Mahindra, Motilal Oswal, Chaayos, Quess Corp, and Thyrocare, among others as its clients. The company has made inroads into other countries like the US where they look to build presence. Shubhankar Bhattacharya, Venture Partner at Kae Capital added, “Over the last year and a half, we have been consistently impressed with how Subbu & Kuljit have built a rapidly growing business in a thoughtful manner. Having won our early clients in the US,we now have a clear roadmap to go much deeper in the US market and are excited at Disprz’s future.” The latest round of funding will be used to build a global presence, strengthening product development and data science capabilities.
