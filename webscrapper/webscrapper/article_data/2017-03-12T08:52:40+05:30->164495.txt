PUNE: For scores of women trying to detangle themselves from patriachal clamps,   had little significance. Veena’s (name changed on request) case provides ample evidence. She is unable to confirm the admission allotted to her son under the   (RTE) Act because schools refuse to accept the mother’s documents, in case a couple is seeking a divorce.

 Veena’s three-year-old son has been allotted a school under the RTE Act but she has been running pillar to post to find out if the admission can be confirmed. The 28-year-old has filed for divorce but the court proceedings are yet to start. 
 
 Meanwhile, her husband has refused to provide documents so the son can get admitted to a school. This leaves Veena in the lurch as she has no relevant documents on her own. Moreover, since the divorce is yet to be finalised, even if she gets the paperwork in place, the school may not accept it. While the education minister recently made it clear that even divorced women can seek admission for their children under the RTE Act as long as they are eligible, most are unable to seek the benefits. 
 
 Activists point out that a majority of women from the lower economic strata hardly ever seek divorce despite separating from their husband. With no documents to show for the separation at the time of admission, the school asks for residential and income proof or caste certificate, which is in the name of the father and so the children remain out of the ambit of RTE Act. “All my documents were at my husband’s place. When I asked him for the documents, he said that he has nothing to do with me or my son and that he didn’t have them,” she added.
 
 When told about the case, deputy director of education Dinkar Temkar said, “We will look into the matter. We will examine whatever documents she has and try to see if it can be considered as a special case. ”
