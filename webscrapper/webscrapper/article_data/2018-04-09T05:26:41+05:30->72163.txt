The share of state development loans (SDLs) in the combined market borrowing of states and the central government through dated securities (G-secs) has increased to 41.6% in 2017-18 from 24.1% in 2012-13. This reflects the sharp increase in the aggregate   of states in recent years and has enhanced the importance of SDLs for the bond markets. 

  SDLs are issued by state governments for financing their fiscal deficits. In all, 14 states - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal - were the largest issuers of gross SDLs in 2017-18. 
 
  The aggregate gross annual issuance of SDLs has also increased at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2% between 2012-13 and 2016-17 to Rs 3.8 lakh crore, indicating increasing reliance by states on market borrowings to fund their fiscal deficit. 
 
 In contrast, the Union government's fiscal deficit expanded at a relatively modest CAGR of 2.2% between 2012-13 and 2016-17 - to Rs 5.3 lakh crore from Rs 4.9 lakh crore. This was reflected in the muted 1.1% CAGR of the gross annual issuance of G-secs at Rs. 5.8 lakh crore in 2016-17 from Rs 5.6 lakh crore in 2012-13.
 
 The maturity profile of the   stock of a state government is determined by the size of its fiscal deficit, its proportion funded through SDL, and the tenor of the securities that it issues. "Our analysis highlights those states that could benefit from issuing SDLs with a maturity shorter than 10 years in 2018-19, to smoothen their SDL redemption profile in the near-to-medium term, reduce the rollover risk and possibly lower their overall cost of borrowing," ratings agency   said. 
 
  The RBI allowed the state governments to migrate to a full-fledged system of auction of state government securities from 2006-07 onwards from the earlier umbrella tranche method. The share of SDLs in financing the fiscal deficit of states has increased sharply from 16.9% in 2006-07 to 75.4% in the 2016-17 Budget estimates. 
 
 The other key sources of financing the fiscal deficit of the states include loans from financial institutions, loans from the central government, state provident funds and reserve funds, among others. In the recent years, the aggregate fiscal deficit of states has more than doubled to Rs 4.8 lakh crore in 2016-17 from Rs 2 lakh crore in 2012-13.
