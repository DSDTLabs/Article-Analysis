LUCKNOW: Setting new standards of   with the tagline  ,   (Your government at your doorstep), chief minister   on Thursday reviewed the status of public complaints by speaking to complainants directly.

 Through a three-hour-long video conferencing with the district magistrates (DMs) and senior superintendents of police (SSPs) of 14 districts, the CM wanted to know if they were satisfied with the response of the government. This was the first time that a CM has directly spoken to the complainants for a direct feedback.
 
 Last month CM had sought clarification from 10 DMs and SSPs on poor disposal rate of public grievances and once again reviewed performance of these districts on Thursday. Interacting with the administrative heads of these districts, Yogi said public complaints should be disposed of timely as delay in action reflects poorly on the government which will not be tolerated. Yogi reviewed the disposal of complaints that he had received during   at Lucknow and directed officials to treat regular complaints received at the divisional and district level with seriousness.
 
 Directing the officials to dispose of all the complaints received till June 30 latest by July 31, he said that similar video conferences will be held at 24 hour notice to assess the performance of the officials in terms of dealing with public grievances. He said DMs and SSPs should ensure timely disposal of complaints at the district level while at the divisional level the Commissioners and Additional Director Generals (ADGs) and Inspector general (IGs) of the police zone should ensure timely action on complaints.
 
 Chief Minister also directed the chief secretary and director general of police to hold monthly review meetings to assess the disposal of public grievances on the basis of merit and without any prejudice. He said the complaints if redressed at the appropriate level will help establishing a better system to serve the people.
