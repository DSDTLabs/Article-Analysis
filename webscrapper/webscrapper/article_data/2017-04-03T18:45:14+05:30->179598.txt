 may have earned himself the moniker of ‘Mr. Perfectionist’ considering how he goes to great lengths to get into the skin of his characters. But looks like 
  is not far behind. The actor, who plays an aspiring Bhojpuri singer in his next ‘Lucknow Central’, is all for method acting. In order to essay the role convincingly, Farhan reportedly watched a string of Bhojpuri films as a part of his prep. According to reports, the ‘Rock On!!’ actor watched films like ‘Banke Bihari MLA’, ‘Hamaar Devdas’ and ‘Sasura Bada Paisawala’ in a week’s time. Turns out, Farhan wanted to grasp the tonality of the language and the diction.
