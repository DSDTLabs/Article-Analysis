NEW DELHI: The capital is set to have a   of 10,000 public buses, but not before 2019.

 In December 2017, Supreme Court directed Delhi government to procure more buses and take the total to 10,000 by the end of 2018. Government sources said the transport department has drawn a proposal to procure approximately 3,500 buses to reach the said figure, but will only make it by next year.
 
 “Delhi needs a fleet of 10,000 to 11,000 buses. We have chalked out a plan to procure more of them and will start floating tenders in the coming months,” said a transport department official.
 
 Currently, Delhi has 5,592 buses, of which 3,944 are Delhi Transport Corporation’s (DTC) and 1,648 are operated under the cluster scheme by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS). The government will procure 2,000 more buses this year, of which 1,000 each will be added to   and cluster scheme fleets. The tender for four different clusters has been floated. DTC is going to engage a consultant to prepare its bid.
 
 “We will float tenders in phases and buses will start rolling out this year,” the official said. It is unlikely that more buses, apart from the 2,000 the government is procuring at present, would hit the roads before 2019, he added.
 
 It could take 8-10 months for buses to roll out on the roads after the tenders are floated. “The reason why it takes more time is because we have an entirely CNG-run bus fleet and they are not available off the shelf and are manufactured only on order,” said a senior DTC official.
 
 Another reason cited by the government for delay in procurement was paucity of land for parking buses. For 2,000 buses, which the government is in the process of procuring, land for depots is already earmarked in different parts of the city.
 
 Transport minister Kailash Gahlot had written to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal in November 2017 to direct DDA to allot 135 acres where depots could be constructed. He had cited lack of parking space as the prime reason behind inadequate public transport system.
 
 The government currently has 257 acres land available for depots and new ones are being built on 68 acres. For parking 11,000 buses, there is an additional requirement of 135 acres. An official said that the government was hopeful of getting more land this year, so has gone ahead with the proposal to procure more buses.
 
 With over 5,500 available buses and 2,000 more being procured, the city needs about 3,500 more buses for a fleet of 10,000.
 
 DTC alone ferries over 30 lakh passengers per day, which is more than the daily ridership of  . The buses are inadequate to meet the demand in the city.
