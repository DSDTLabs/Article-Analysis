Though they were all arrested later, it was another   in a growing list of women and girls being harassed while using public transport in Uttarakhand. This had come just after a girl in December last year tweeted to chief minister   and shared with him her “harrowing experience” in a city bus on the Premnagar route.

 The Uttarakhand police in a novel initiative has now launched ‘Project Awaaz’ to make city buses safer for women passengers. Under the project, which is a first-ofits-kind, whistles have been placed on every seat for women to blow and alert in case they face any harassment.
 
 As many as 60 city buses have been selected for the initiative on a pilot basis. Based
 
 on the feedback, it would be extended to all 270 city buses soon. deputy inspector general (traffic) Kewal Khurana said, “Any woman passenger facing harassment or molestation while commuting in city buses can now blow a whistle as part of ‘Project Awaaz’. The initiative is aimed at making public transport safer for women.”
 
 Khurana added: “Usually, women don’t gather the courage to speak out against the abuse they face while using public transport. Now they have to just blow a whistle to alert the driver, conductor and everyone around them. The matter will be immediately referred to police so that the miscreants can be arrested.”
 
 Ashok Kumar, additional director general of police (law and order), said that beside whistles,   have also been directed to install CCTV cameras to ensure the safety and security of passengers, particularly women.
 
 Police officials said that strict action would be taken against drivers and conductors who refuse to help women in distress.
