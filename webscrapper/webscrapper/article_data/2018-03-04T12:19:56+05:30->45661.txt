VISAKHAPATNAM: When you read about Munich-based   successfully testing a   jet last year, did you wish you too could travel in a ‘flying car’? Well, that could become a reality for AP and   in a couple of years.

 A US-based company with an Indian partner is interested in bringing the technology to AP and Vizag and Amaravati are their favoured destinations for setting it up. These electric Vertical Take-off and Landing Vehicles (VTOL) or ‘flying cars’ can fly over traffic congestions. Estimates show the futuristic technology will also be affordable at Rs 4 per km per passenger.
 
 After attending the Partnership Summit, that ended this week, the company is in talks with the state government for a demo of this technology in   by early 2019.
 
 “The road-cum-air vehicle would be somewhat a larger version of the drone and would be able to carry two to eight passengers. These vehicles are built on light yet high-power motors that can lift the vehicle off the ground. The speed of the   would be around 350kms per hour and it will not fly too high. It can pick up speed up to 400 km... Vizag is one of the favoured places where land would be available for setting up the manufacturing unit,” said George O’Neal, co-founder of   Inc.
 
 Chiranjeev Kalra, another co-founder of Karman, averred, “This mode of transport has the potential to solve India’s traffic problem. Our company is considering establishing a permanent base in India, with plans to demonstrate this technology to the  . We are in talks with the state government and have proposed a manufacturing and vehicle demo in AP in early 2019 to coincide with the 2019 CII-AP Partnership Summit.” “It is a passenger transportation that is personal and fast. Our proprietary systems can bring the flying car ride at an extremely affordable cost in India – Rs 4 per km per passenger,” added O’Neal.
