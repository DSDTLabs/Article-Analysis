Visakhapatnam: The development of an IT layout at   is going on at a snail’s pace.

 After the visit of IT minister Nara Lokesh in September last year, the stakeholders were expecting rapid development of the layout by the end of the 2017-18 financial year in March.
 
 However, a reality check shows that except an approach road to the layout, work on major infrastructure facilities is still pending.
 
 Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) was entrusted the task of developing the layout in two phases on the hills at Kapuluppada and outskirts of the city towards Srikakulam from Vizag two years ago. In the first phase, nearly 250 acres of the layout would have to be developed by APIIC with basic facilities like approach road, street lights, drainage, water facility, roads, duct for internet cables, telephone wires among other facilities.
 
 “Except 50% of the approach road works to the layout, nothing has improved. The government needs to give special attention on development of the layout on a fast track basis,” a proprietor of an IT company said.
 
 Speaking to TOI, K Vijayanand, principal secretary to the state government (IT and communications) said most of the pending IT-related projects would be over this year.
 
 O Naresh Kumar, executive director of IT Association of Andhra Pradesh, said, “The work on the IT layout at Kapuluppada should be improved for early handover of the layout to the budding and existing IT companies in the city and state.”
 
 The layout development works also include the marking of the plots (each one acre to five acres capacity) to set up at least 100 companies on the layout. Nearly Rs 25-30 lakh is required to develop each acre as it is located on the hill and far away from the city, said a revenue official.
