AHMEDABAD:   fined   — who filed a   to free his ‘wife’ from the alleged   by her parents — Rs 10,000.

 A resident of Ahmedabad, Dudhat will have to pay because he filed the habeas corpus petition twice, despite the woman flatly refusing to go with him and telling the court that she was not forced or compelled to stay at her father’s house.
 
 The court was angrered by Dudhat when the girl complained that Dudhat is in the habit of harassing her, and bothers her by repeatedly showing up at her home. The girl also said that she recently got engaged to another man and Dudhat was trying to sabotage her engagement. He filed the habeas corpus petition with a view to draw the attention of her in-laws to be.
 
 After the woman rebuffed him at the hearing of the first petition last year, Dudhat’s second petition claimed that the girl continues to call him, asking him to free her from her parents’ harassment. The HC had reluctantly issued notice, but got the expected response.
 
 The HC said, “This was an unfortunate attempt on the part of the petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of the court when the facts of his knowledge would be insufficient to secure a notice in the present petition.” After directing Dudhat to deposit Rs 10,000 by February 28, the judges ordered that the amount be paid to the woman’s father, who was unnecessarily made to come to court twice.
