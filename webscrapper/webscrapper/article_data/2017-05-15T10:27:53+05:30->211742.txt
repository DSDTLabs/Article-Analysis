PUNE: The credit of  's turnaround should go to the Indian bowlers of his team, Pune opening batsman   said after their win over   on Sunday. "On a wicket like today's it's not always easy to bowl on a slower wicket. Bowlers tend to lose temperament on such track, but I would credit them for the way they have executed. It's a heartening sign for Indian cricket as well."

 With 21wickets, pacer Jaydev Unadkat is the highest wicket-taker for Pune and second highest in the league so far, behind Bhuvaneshwar Kumar's 25. Also, Shardul Thakur has done well with eight wickets from 10 games. Rahane said his team's turning point was a win over Roy al Challengers Bangalore. "I think we have gone as per the way we had planned prior to the tournament. We started well against   here, then lost a couple of games but I think the turning point was our win against Bangalore. We got momentum from that game and sustained it. I think the credit should be given to our Indian bowlers for the way they have bowled under pressure and the manner in which they carried the responsibility that was handed to them," he said.
 
 When asked about the idea behind opting to bowl first against Punjab, he said, "The Mumbai wicket was completely different. This wicket was on the drier side. It wasn't easy for the batsmen initially. I think they were looking to score 170-180 from ball one but it was a 130-140 wicket."
