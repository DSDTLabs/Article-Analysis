CHENNAI: The   (TNCA) is likely to do away with the local   featuring all the first-division league teams due to a cramped schedule this year. “The   concludes on Thursday (May 25). To top that, the first-division league is in its business end as well and the matches will start tentatively from May 28. The first-division league final is scheduled to take place in the third week of June. In such a busy schedule, it may be difficult to conduct the   Twenty20 competition this year,” a top TNCA official told TOI on Wednesday.

 The new season is expected to start from the first week of July and Tamil Nadu Premier League will follow thereafter. “We must take into account that many players have more or less played without a break. Since the TNPL last year, the players have been featuring either in the league games or represented the Ranji side. It is important to keep them fresh,” the official added. The T20 tournament had only come into existence last year with all the 12 first-division teams being part of it, and was named after the late Ashok Kumbhat who served as the treasurer and subsequently as secretary of TNCA.
 
 The inaugural edition — held from May 31 to June 12 — was won by Vijay CC.
 
 One of the TNPL franchise co-owners felt this move could affect teams that are looking for talents ahead of the players draft next month. “Doing away with the T20 tournament could be bad news for franchises that have a few slots to fill ahead of the second edition of TNPL. Unless you see a player in match mode, it is difficult to assess his potential going in to the draft. The first edition of the T20 tournament did offer us a peek into the talent here which may not be the case this time,” said the co-owner.
