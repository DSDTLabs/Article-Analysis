The Telugu version of Ganesh Raj’s Malayalam directorial ' ' received critical acclaim and raked in good numbers at the box office when it released in 2016. Starring newcomers  ,  , Roshan Mathew,  , Siddhi Mahajankatti, Annu Antony and Anarkali Marikar in lead roles, the film also stars   in a key role.
Now, the film is releasing in Telugu and the jukebox features four songs composed by Sachin Warrier and penned by Vanamali. First on the album is the short and sweet number 'Anaganaga' crooned by Krishna Chaitanya. The song talks of the journey, engineering students go through and the struggles they face with their academics. The song has peppy music and tune, but the lyrics seem to have lost their charm, being lost in translation. The vocals of this song are good enough, though nothing really stands out much in this number.
 'Nammela Lede' featuring Krishna Chaitanya and Manisha’s vocals is a slow and soft number that features good enough lyrics, but the vocals, tune and music do nothing to lift this number. Hymanth’s 'Evvala Kannullo' is a beautiful romantic number with adorable lyrics, vocals, tune and music. This number stands out from the rest, majorly because of the effective and soft vocals and music.
 'Ee Prayanam Lo', the final number on the album, sung by Hymanth and Manisha is yet another number on the album with okay vocals, lyrics and music, with nothing really standing out. The album of 'Anandam' is an underwhelming one and if you have heard the album of Happy Days way back in 2007, there’s really nothing new to offer here. It’s only 'Evvala Kannullo' that seems good enough for a one-time listen. Steer clear of this album unless you have time to kill.
