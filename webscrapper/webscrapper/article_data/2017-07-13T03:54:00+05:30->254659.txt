Panaji: The   supplementary exams held in June have been cleared by 42.09% students. Altogether, 1,416 candidates appeared for the exams, of which 596 passed.

 The exams were held from June 19 to 27 at four centres across the state.
 
 Although such exams were held in June and October over the last couple of years, the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education noticed that very few candidates actually appeared for the tests in October. 
 
 It was also of the opinion that the October exams were a waste of time as students who cleared them would still have to wait until June the following year to join higher educational programmes.
 
 As a result, the board in December last year “abolished” supplementary October examinations for both students of Class X and XII.
 
 Until 2016, only those who failed in up to two subjects in the March exam could attempt papers at the June exam. With the October exams scrapped, students could attempt any number of subjects at the June supplementary test from this year onwards.
 
 Students who have cleared Class X and XII exams can also appear for the June examination to improve their scores, as has been the norm till now.
 
 Earlier this month, results of the Class XII June exams were declared, with 48.13% emerging successful. Of the 1,710 students who appeared, 823 passed.
