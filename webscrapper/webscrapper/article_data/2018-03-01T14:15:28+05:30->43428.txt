TRICHY: Though the issue over relocating vegetable shops from Gandhi market in the city to the central vegetable market at   in the outskirts was ongoing,   district administration was confident that all shops will be relocated to the new location by June this year. 
 
 “Ensuring that the central vegetable market is functional is the responsibility of the district collector and it will be done in a few months,” Trichy collector K   told reporters here on Wednesday. 
  
 Constructed at a cost of Rs 77 crore including the Rs 12 crore used to procure the land, the central vegetable market in Kallikudi on   became the bone of contention between the vegetable vendors and the district administration. 
  
 The vendors refused to relocate to the new campus citing distance and other discrepancies, even after the inauguration of the site by chief minister  , few months ago. 
  
 After traders complained that the space of the shops was small, the district administration was in the process of increasing it by augmenting them. “The work of converting 500 shops into 250 shops is underway. The work will be over in a day or two. Besides, we have sought some additional facilities for the market from the government and have also got the approval,” said the collector. 
  
 The process of taking over 5 acres to 6 acres of land from Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) and from the revenue department for vehicle parking and vegetable dumping cum processing yard was also progressing, said collector Rajamani. 
  
 “Being one of the cities selected for smart city project, Trichy city is getting projects for infrastructure development. The area where the Gandhi market is functioning will be utilised purposefully by the city corporation, after the shops are relocated,” he added.
