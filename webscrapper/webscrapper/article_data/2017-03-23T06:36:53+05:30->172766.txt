NEW DELHI: Under pressure to fulfil the farm debt waiver promise made in the Congress’s election manifesto, Punjab chief minister Captain   on Wednesday met Prime Minister   to seek a special central government package.

 This is the first meeting between Amarinder and Modi ever since the Congress strongman became the CM. Amarinder, who also handed a letter and detailed note to Modi, said total farm debt in Punjab amounted to more than Rs 80,000 crore, including crop loans in cooperative sector amounting to about Rs 12,500 crore. “The average debt per farm household in Punjab works out to be Rs 8 lakh (including crop loan), while the state’s per hectare debt of small and marginal farmers was the highest in India,” he told Modi.
 
 Citing a spate of farm suicides in the state, Amarinder sought a one-time loan waiver. Punjab has not had a waiver since UPA -1, when then Prime minister   had given a package. Till now, Punjab chief minister Parkash Badal had been dashing to Modi and Manmohan frequently to seek bailout packages. “The mounting farm debts is making agriculture in Punjab increasingly unsustainable, endangering not only the food security of the nation but also the social fabric of this sensitive border state,” Amarinder told reporters outside Parliament after meeting Modi.
 
 Both SAD and Congress during Badal regime had locked horns over which party had pipped the other in offering farm-relief packages. Amarinder later added that “though he had sought financial assistance from the Centre, his government was committed to waiver of the farmers’ loans and already initiated a time-bound process for it”.
 
 The state cabinet had, in its maiden meeting, directed necessary steps to implement the Congress’s poll promise on farm debt waiver, he said. Captain Amarinder made the request at a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at   here on Wednesday.
