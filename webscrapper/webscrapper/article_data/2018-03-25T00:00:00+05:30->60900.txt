For two senior actors to star in a film made by a team of newbies, and to confidently follow inputs given by the director says a lot about what one can expect from the movie. We spoke to   and   about their roles in this week’s release,  , and here’s what they had to say…

 
 
 I play a police officer, who is frustrated because his juniors get promoted over him. He is slightly corrupt, but very strict. He’s a 
 slightly complex character, and there is anger in him. This makes him ruthless, and he takes out his anger on his victims. The role demanded some amount of preparation, because Janardhan (Chikkanna, director) wanted me to speak in a certain way, which took some time to get used to.
 
 
 
 I am the chief minister of a state in the film, who has been in power for 15 years and is known for having a clean image. The film is based on cybercrime and that is something that my character gets involved in. There is a cyber security breach and the chief minister finds himself entangled in it. His name surfaces in a case, but if he is guilty of committing the crime or not will be revealed only once you watch the film.
