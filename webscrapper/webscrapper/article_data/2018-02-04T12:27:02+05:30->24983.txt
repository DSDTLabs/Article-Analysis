PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The state government has initiated the process of distributing land titles to  , who came here from Pakistan after the Partition.

 The move is likely to benefit people living in 36 Sindhi colonies across the state.
 
 The state government has directed Pune collector   and   municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar to conduct a survey of Sindhi families who migrated from Sindh province in Pakistan and were rehabilitated in Pimpri camp.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Shahjahan Mulani, under secretary, state revenue department, said, “The decision to conduct the survey of Sindhi migrants residing in Pimpri was taken at the meeting held by state revenue minister  .”
 
 "No time limit has been given for completion of the surve," said Mulani.
 
  Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar said, “A large number of people from Sindh province in Pakistan migrated to India after the Partition. They were settled in Maharashtra in 36 colonies, mostly in army barracks in Pimpri, Ulhasnagar, Jalgaon, Dhule, Kolhapur, Deolali( ), Amravati, Nagpur, Gondia, Mumbai and Thane. A decision was taken in 1971 to give title deeds of land on which they had settled. A large number of migrants tried to obtain these deeds but only a few succeeded. The members of Sindhi community have been demanding the title deeds for several decades.”
 
 Vijaysingh Deshmukh, deputy collector, Pune, said, "The government will take a decision after the survey."
 
 “Displaced People’s Act has been repealed. So action can be taken only under Maharashtra Land Revenue Code ( ) under which encroachments can be regularised," he said.
