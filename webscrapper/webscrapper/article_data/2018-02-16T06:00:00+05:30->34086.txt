Kolkata: West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee has refused to allow telecast of PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Pariksha par Charcha’ in institutions run by the state school education and higher education department.

 At the event, Modi will advise examinees on how to deal with exam stress.
 
 On Thursday, Chatterjee said: “Our students are at the moment gearing up to appear in Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations. Last-minute preparations are on. I do not see any need to make arrangements in educational institutions to watch the telecast.”
 
 UGC had issued a circular asking universities and even IITs to telecast the PM’s interactive address from Delhi’s Talkotra Stadium, where a section of students will be present. 
 
 Several city-based CBSE and CISCE affiliated schools have already asked students to be present for the PM’s lecture from 11am on Friday.
