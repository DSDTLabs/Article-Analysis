He came to Nagpur to stage his popular Marathi play ' ', and ' ' of Marathi film industry,  , also got a chance to sample all kinds of food in Nagpur. We took him along on a food trail...
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 We noticed that Amey was limping as he was on stage and even when he was walking along Nagpur streets. When we asked him the reason, he confessed, “I had a surgery done on my foot a couple of days back, hence the limp.” But wasn’t it safer to rest his leg for a few days, we asked and the diehard   man that he is, Amey said, ‘When people can come to watch me, taking out time from their busy schedules, what is a little limp in such a situation? Theatre has taught me that the show must go on and minor ailments and hurdles don’t matter.”
 
 
 
 
 
 Amey’s view on awards is also quite simple. Thrilled about veteran actor   having received Sangeet Natak Akademi award recently, he said, “I have had the privilege of having worked with Mohan ji and it is an honour for the entire Marathi industry. I feel awards really motivate an actor to give his very best; getting an appreciation from one’s peers and seniors means a lot.”
 
 
 
 
 We took him to youngsters’ favourite adda in town —   Lake —where the actor was surrounded by a lot of fans, who took his autographs and clicked selfies with him. Obliging all of them with that trademark smile of his that comes straight from the heart, Amey also managed to enjoy the street food of Nagpur. Loving the butter bhutta that is a must have in winters, he roasted his own bhutta, just the way he wanted it. Vada-pav also caught his fancy at one of street joints in Sitabuldi and without making a fuss or starry airs, he heartily enjoyed the experience. “I love the flavours of Nagpur. Unlike Pune and Nashik, there is a touch of MP in Nagpur’s cuisine and the food here is quite spicy. I find that the city has new lounges and fine dining places too, which means that it is getting more cosmopolitan.”
