HYDERABAD: The Banjara Hills Road No 3 stretch between   and   is turning out to be a killer stretch as several   have been reported at the location. A narrow, steep road with a curve and bad road engineering are contributing to the spate of accidents and made it one of the most accident-prone spots in the city.

 Many motorists fail to notice the curve and end up crashing into the median. Most accidents at the location happened due to high speed and often it turned out to be human error which cost lives.
 
 Traffic police blame road engineering defect near the   as it becomes difficult for motorists cruising at high speed to negotiate a slight curve.
 
 For pedestrians, travelling on the Road No. 3 is a nightmare. On several occasions, pedestrians crossing the road were knocked down by speeding vehicles. As a result, GHMC officials are now in the process of putting in place a foot over bridge near Sultan-Ul-Uloom Education Society campus.
