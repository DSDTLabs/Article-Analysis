  : The visit of Prime Minister   to states and Union territories ruled by opposition parties is largely seen as the saffron party's attempts to establish a base in 'unconquered' territories. The BJP and its allies are in government in 19 states, the   in four states and a Union territory, while others in six states and Delhi. 

 This year, Modi has visited poll-bound states like Karnataka, Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland before embarking on a two-day visit to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on February 24 and 25. Only once has a BJP candidate been elected to the legislative assembly of Puducherry when A M Krishnamurthy won the Reddiarpalayam constituency, defeating CPI candidate R Viswanathan in 2001. Krishnamurthy's election to the assembly was mainly because of the rapport he had with the voters coupled with an anti-Viswanathan wave. When BJP's   lost 2004 Lok Sabha poll to PMK's M Ramadoss, garnering 1.72 lakh votes was the only significant performance. In the 2016 assembly poll, the BJP fielded candidates in 18 of the 30 seats but lost all. All the candidates barring one lost their deposits.
 
 Modi's visit this week will definitely boost the morale of the party's functionaries and workers on the ground, but will it be able to catalyse the formation of an alliance against the mighty Congress in Puducherry is the big question.
