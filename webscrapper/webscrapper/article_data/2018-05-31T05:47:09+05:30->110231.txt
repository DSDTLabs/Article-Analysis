GURUGRAM: A water pipeline at the   treatment plant burst on Tuesday, triggering shortages in DLF 1, Sushant Lok 1 and Sector 57. While   ( ) officials said supply, though lower than usual, resumed by 4am on Wednesday, residents said the   left them to the mercy of water tanker suppliers. Supply is expected to normalise by Thursday morning.

 
 According to GMDA officials, a 1,300mm water pipeline burst at Basai due to high pressure. “It burst so severely that it cut a 2-metre-long cavity in the supply line,” an official told TOI.
 
  “We fixed the pipeline on Tuesday itself, but water supply resumed only by 4am on Wednesday because all lines had run out of water. It takes time for normal water supply to resume. This line normally supplies up to 280 MLD (million litres a day) of water,” the official added.
 
 Residents said they had to suffer from acute water shortage as a result. “It is summer, so a water crisis during this part of the year hits us particularly hard,” said Umesh Yadav, a resident of DLF 1. “A lot of people had to use bottled drinking water for bathing and other uses,” he added.
 
 Residents alleged that during such times, the water tanker ‘mafia’ takes advantage of the situation and supplies tankers at exorbitant rates. “They charge anything between Rs 1,500 - Rs 2,000 per tanker, when the usual rate is around Rs 1,000,” a resident of Sushant Lok 1 said.
 
 The GMDA official said residents shouldn’t worry since the supply line has already been restored. “Water will come at a normal pace from Thursday morning. Supply will slowly increase at night, when there is little demand. From Thursday morning, residents will get normal flow of water,” the official said.
