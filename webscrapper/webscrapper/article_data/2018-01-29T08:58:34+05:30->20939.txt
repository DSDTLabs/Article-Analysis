MELBOURNE: The fifth-seeds in the mixed doubles -   and Timea Babos - bowed to the spirited charge of Canada’s   and Croatia’s Mate Pavic, who fought off a championship point to emerge triumphant on Sunday at the  .

  
 Pavic, who won the men’s doubles title, and Babos, victorious in the women’s doubles, were going for a double. The Croat, 24, ranked 16 and Dabrowski, who had won the French Open title partnering Bopanna, came through 2-6, 6-4, 11-9 in 68 minutes. Pavic congratulated his opponents. “Rohan and Timea did well, they even had a championship point, maybe next time, next year if they play together.”
 
 Dabrowski, who had posed a winning partnership with Bopanna at   last year, said she had learnt of the Indian’s decision to partner Babos in a newspaper article. “After that, I messaged some people and Mate was one of those people. He responded almost immediately,” she said when asked how the Canadian-Croatian pairing had come together.
 
 The Canadian added: “I wasn’t about to go find another partner without talking to him first. But this is the industry that we are in, you have to have a tough skin. At the same time, he made a good decision with her. They played so well all week.”
