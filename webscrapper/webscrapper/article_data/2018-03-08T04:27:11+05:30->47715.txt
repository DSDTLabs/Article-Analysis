MUMBAI: The   staged a walkout in the assembly on Wednesday, alleging that the   had reduced the height of the proposed Chhatrapati   Maharaj memorial off the city coast.

 The BJP-led state government denied any change in the proposed height of the  , pegged to be tallest in the world. L&T has been awarded the construction contract for the Rs 2,500 crore project.
 
 “We have heard that the height of the statue is being reduced from 160 metres to 126 metres and the height of the pedestal on which it stands is also being reduced,” Jayant Patil of the NCP said. “This will upset the citizens of Maharashtra.”
 
 Prithviraj Chavan of the Congress said the government was reducing the height of the statue and increasing the height of the cement pedestal on which it would stand. He asked if the state was going to obtain environmental clearance for the memorial again after changing its height. 
 
 Ajit Pawar of the NCP accused the government of trying to win elections in Shivaji’s name and then letting down his followers.
 
 Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the height of the proposed statue remained unchanged at 210 metres. “There should be no doubt about this. It will be the tallest statue in the world,” he said. 
 
 Mungantiwar said it was the Congress-NCP government that had failed to make any progress on it. “A work order for the statue has been issued by our government in 2018. It is a pity that this was not done by the previous government for 15 years,” he said.
 
 CM Devendra Fadnavis said the height of the statue and the pedestal had to be in a 60:40 ratio for technical reasons. “The height of these components has been decided by the expert committee, including the JJ School of Art, and not the government,” he said.
