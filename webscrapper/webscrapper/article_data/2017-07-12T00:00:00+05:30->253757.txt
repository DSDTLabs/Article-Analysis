 users hear, hear! The end of ‘low-battery anxiety’ might come sooner than we anticipated. In an exciting recent development in the field of telecommunications, researchers out of the   have created a mobile phone   that doesn’t require a   to operate.
The surprisingly efficient prototype requires just 3.5 microwatts of energy, can make and receive calls and uses ambient power from radio signals and light to transmit a signal back to a base station 50 feet away. The creation is a major leap in the capability of battery-free devices and a step towards a fully functional battery-free cellphone, one that could come very handy in an emergency.
 As of now, the barebones prototype is only made of basic materials such as a circuit board, capacitive touch buttons, etc. The team of scientists was able to create a custom base station to transmit the signal with such a small amount of power. Using this setup, the researchers were able to successfully make and receive calls via   and place callers on hold. But because it is incapable of making and receiving signals at the same time, users must hold down a button to speak to the recipient and release it to await a reply — very similar to using a walkie-talkie. And without the power for a speaker, owners listen to calls using their headphones.
 So could it actually be possible for battery-free mobile phones to become ubiquitous? It’s possible if all cell towers or Wi-Fi routers come with the base station technology embedded in it, or if licensed mobile network frequencies can be used, say the researchers. The next steps for creating a usable phone with a display, they add, would be adding a low-power e-ink display with video-streaming capabilities and encryption to make the calls more secure.
