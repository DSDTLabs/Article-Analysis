NEW DELHI: Anand Kumar Tewari, an IPS officer posted in Assam, has been removed from service after the government found it to be "unsatisfactory", an official said. The 1994 batch police officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre was removed as he was a "deadwood" due to his "unsatisfactory" service records, the home ministry official said. 

 Tewari is the sixth IPS officer in two years to be removed. The performance of the IGP-rank officer was reviewed by a home ministry-appointed committee and it found him to be unfit to continue and hence ordered him to go on compulsory retirement. 
 
 The performance review of   (IPS) officers was conducted to weed out "deadwood", the officer said on condition of anonymity. According to rules, performance review of an all-India service officer is conducted twice - first after the completion of 15 years of qualifying service, and then after 25 years. The order removing him was issued by the home ministry last week after approval by the  , headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 According to the service rules, the central government may, in consultation with the state government concerned, require a member of the service to retire in public interest, after giving at least a three-month notice in writing or as many months pay and allowances. Tewari was initially avoiding the notices served by the home ministry and finally he has received the order sending him to go on compulsory retirement, the official said. PTI
