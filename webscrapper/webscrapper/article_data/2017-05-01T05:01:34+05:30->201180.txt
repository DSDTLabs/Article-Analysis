NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday called for eradication of VIP culture by cleansing the Indian mindset, saying “VIP” must be replaced by “EPI” —  . The PM said his vision of ‘New India’ was that in place of VIP, priority should be accorded to EPI. 

 In his radio address ‘Mann ki Baat’, Modi said the decision to get rid of red beacons (lal batti) was aimed at removing VIP culture from the people’s mindset. “The red beacon used to be fixed atop a vehicle but slowly and steadily it permeated into the psyche and got firmly entrenched in the mindset. The red beacon has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that it has also disappeared from the mindset,” the PM said. 
 
 A day before the decision to ban red beacons came into effect, the PM said all 125 crore people of the country had equal value and importance. Modi said there was disdain for VIP culture in the country and his decision to remove red beacons had struck a deep chord with people. “I did not know that people have so much contempt for VIP culture before we took the decision recently banning use of red beacons on vehicles of ministers and others,” he added. 
 
 The PM also took a phone call from Jabalpur resident Shiva Choubey who hailed the decision. “I want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision,” Choubey said.
