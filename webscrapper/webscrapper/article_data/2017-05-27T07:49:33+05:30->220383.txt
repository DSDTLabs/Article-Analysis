LUCKNOW: The special investigation team constituted to probe the death of IAS officer   has decided to seek the medical history of the officer from his home cadre. Through details of his medical history, the team wants to ensure that Tewari did not suffer from any medical condition. 

 Tewari was found dead on May 17 outside VIP guest house on Meerabai Marg. 
 
 As the postmortem report stated asphyxia as the cause of Tewari's death, the team working on the case is trying to find out if he was suffering from a medical complication or taking medicines of any kind.
 
 While the officer's family maintains the Tewari did not have any health issues, the SIT will crosscheck with Karnataka government about medical bills for reimbursement or if he was under treatment.
 
 "Two officers will visit Bengaluru in a day or two to check his service record. They will also check if he was taking medicines. Usually, officers get bills reimbursed. It will help us narrow down the scope of investigation," said SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar.
 
 Police have not been able to find any witness who saw Tewari step out of the guest house on the night. His elder brother Mayank had asked chief minister   for   inquiry into the case.
