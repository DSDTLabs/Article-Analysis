 “An emergency pumping station was installed on the shore of Krishna at Puttamgandi to pump water to Akkampally balancing reservoir. As KRMB permitted release of six tmc of water, the pumping at Puttamgandi was stopped,“ a   official said.
 
 As water level at Nagarjunsagar dam fell considerably, the water board had cut 90 MGD of Krishna water supply to certain areas in the city from August 31.
 
 The water board, however, with chief minister K Chandrasekhara Rao's permission, is overcoming the shortfall through Manjira water. As per KRMB decision, the Water Board on Saturday resumed Krishna water supply to the city . “Water board will supply 270 MGD to the city. In fact, it is a huge relief for the water board due KRMB's decision,“ HMWS&SB chief general manager, Transmission, B Vijay Kumar Reddy told STOI.
 
 “We cannot say for how long we will be able to supply Krishna water. It will depend on releases from the Nagarjunasagar dam by the irrigation department“, he said.
 
 Water board had taken up dredging at Puttamgandi, an off-take point for supply of Krishna water to the city , after levels in Nagarjunasagar dam fell drastically .
