Priyanka Chopra’s Hollywood debut Baywatch is all set for its release this month. And the actress is in full-swing for promoting her movie. The movie set around beach doesn’t feature Priyanka wearing beachwear in the trailer, but the actress is now seen chilling at the beach in breathtaking bikinis.

 
 Just one day before her movie premiere, Priyanka was spotted chilling on the beach of Miami. PeeCee was spotted in a two-piece bikini chilling with her friend. She paired the strapless bikini top with a cover-up jacket and accessorised the look with mirrored aviators.
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 And post her premiere launch, she made another splash in Miami. She stunned in a two-piece bikini, flaunting her belly button and beach-ready body. She worked this tie-dye blue bikini with a pair of blue aviators and was seen wearing a maxi dress as a cover up. Later she was also seen wearing a beach hat and black shorts with her plunging bikini top.
