NEW DELHI: A 18-year-old man was held at the Kailash Colony   on Sunday afternoon after three live ammunition rounds were detected in his baggage during screening. 

 The incident took place at around 12.30pm when the passenger, identified as Jitendra Kumar, kept his hand bag for checking at the x-ray machine in the station. 
 
 A CISF personnel manning the machine detected something suspicious in his bag after which he was asked to open it and reveal its contents. 
 
 “After opening his hand bag and scanning it manually, three live ammunition rounds of 7.62mm were found from the bag of the passenger and he was brought to the station control room for further interrogation,” said a CISF official. 
 
 Officials said that Kumar, a resident of Bareilly in  , drove an e-rickshaw and upon interrogation, said that he was unaware of the live rounds. “He failed to furnish any government issued document for possessing the arms and ammunition and said that someone might have put them in his bag and that he did not know about them,” added the CISF official. 
 
 The Delhi Metro Rail Police were called to the station for further interrogation after which the passenger was handed over to the cops for further legal action. 
 
 Carrying arms and ammunition in the Delhi Metro is banned under the law.
