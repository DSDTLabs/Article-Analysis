Actor   finds it very hard to separate himself from his 'Harry  ' character,  . 

 The 28-year-old actor shot to fame playing the young wizard in the eight-film ' ' series and though it is almost six years since the final movie was released, he still feels attached to the character and thinks it will always be a part of him. 
 
  
  
 "I think it's always going to be a challenge (to move away from 'Potter'). They're so widely liked and watched and new generations are coming into it, so it'll always be there. 
 
 "It's never really been a conscious decision, I didn't really go out to pick shocking, very adult roles. I'm driven by scripts and people around me. But yeah, you do want to try and step away from the comfort zone," Grint says. 
 
 "I think (Ron) will always be with me. I had a weird relationship with that character because after that we kind of merged into the same person. I find it very hard to separate where I end and   begins."
