COIMBATORE: Ford India is expanding its footprint in tier-3 and tier-4 towns. The auto major would expand its sales and service outlets to 500 from the current level of 376 in the next 2-3 years, a senior official said. Most of the expansion would be in smaller towns, said Prabhu N, vice president, customer service operations, Ford India.

 “Our expansion is focused on tier-3 and tier-4 locations since we have covered most of the main cities already,” he said. Ford’s sales and service outlets are now present in 209 cities across the country. “There is a good demand from smaller towns,” Prabhu, who was here to launch Ford’s new showroom and service facilities in the city and nearby Pollachi, said.
 
 Customers can now find out how much it would cost to service the vehicle from the company’s website, he stated. Ford has made its spare parts available to multi-brand workshops and four-wheeler mechanics in its attempt to bring down the cost of ownership, he said. Ford now has spare parts distributors in Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan.
