CHENNAI: Belying a perception that the BJP was more comfortable with the  , the 10-day-old Palaniswami government seems to have synced with the  .

 During his three-day whirlwind tour of the capital, the chief minister successfully took up several   with the Centre, meeting ministers holding key portfolios to prevail upon them to re-activate pending schemes and clear the backlog.
 
 Amid allegations by Central ministers that the state government remained paralyzed for more than a year, Palaniswami was at pains to prove his efficiency and credentials in a bid to win over the confidence of the people and his government. Senior ministers and bureaucrats of key departments were taken into confidence.
 
 “It is a welcome change to see the CM make a strong pitch for development. This was not evident earlier because of ego issues and confrontational attitude,“ said a senior bureaucrat.
 
 Palaniswami's nod for Chennai Port-Maduravoyal elevated project is seen as a strong signal of the state's keenness to join hands with the Centre.
 
 Strange as it may seem, in the year 2011, the   raised the red flag opposing the project, initiated by the Congress-led UPA regime, and dragged NHAI to the Supreme Court.
 
 Union minister Pon Radhakrish nan said, “It is a good beginning. My wish is to see a lakh crore rupees worth projects for the state from the Centre.“ His road transport, highways and shipping ministry has had a bitter experience with the state, with officials in the rank of secretary repeatedly flying down to coax the state to cooperate.
 
 Frustrated with the state dragging its feet on joining the centre's Uday scheme, power minister Piyush Goyal last year called Tamil Nadu, “a state within a state“ and “a part of the country where he cannot reach out to the chief minister.“
