Flora Saini’s filmography down south and in   is vastly different. While she has acted in glam doll roles in the south (in films like Vijayakanth’s   and Rajinikanth’s  ), she has been part of offbeat fare like Dhanak, Lakshmi, and now,  , the partition drama which stars Vidya Balan in the lead. But she says that she has no regrets for taking up the kind of films that she did in the south. “I was young and new to the industry and all I wanted was to act in a film. The films that I did in the south were my bread-and-butter. And I consider working in south films as my homework to act in Bollywood. So, I’m grateful to the south film industry for giving me a chance to hone my skills,” says Flora, who will be seen playing a sex worker in Begum Jaan.

 The team had to attend a one-month-long workshop to prepare for their roles. “We were asked to come up with our own back story for the character we were playing. I presented Maina as a Gujarati tribal girl who has been sold into the flesh trade by her father who could not run his family,” she reveals.
 
 More importantly, to prepare for her role, the actress went to Mangal Bazaar, an area infamous for prostitution, in Vadodara. “Every girl in every state has some kind of mannerism and dialect that is unique to that place. In this film, there is a good amount of swearing. It’s a different life that these women lead. No matter how many men they sleep with, we have to remember that they are not doing out of their free will. They derive no pleasure in their lovemaking and there is a lot of anger that builds inside them. So, they use gaalis a lot and have an unabashed mannerism. Visiting the place helped me in this regard,” explains Flora.
