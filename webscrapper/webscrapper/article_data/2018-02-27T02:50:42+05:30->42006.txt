NEW DELHI: The   (NGT) has directed Delhi and Haryana governments to identify and address the sources of pollution in  , saying the water’s pollution was exceedingly high.

 The direction comes a week after it had directed the governments to hold a meeting to address the issue of growing ammonia levels in the Yamuna.
 
 A bench headed by justice Jawad Rahim told both the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to take action against erring industries.
 
 “Though, the issue is with regard to high level of ammonia in the water which is reaching the water reservoir of Delhi Jal Board, if you take the entire river eco-system, the pollution level in the portion of the river passing Delhi also needs to be properly checked,” said the bench in its order on Friday.
 
 The tribunal further asked CPCB and DJB to ensure that erring industries are dealt with appropriately. 
 
 The pollution control board will also be required to file a fresh report in front of the tribunal on Tuesday after its initial report on ammonia levels appeared to have incorrect levels for Khojkipur. The board had submitted the report showing different levels of ammonia in the Yamuna collected from different points.
