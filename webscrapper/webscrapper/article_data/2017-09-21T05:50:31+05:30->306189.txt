AHMEDABAD: The addition of 20 marks each to the results of 70 students who appeared for their   and MPhil examination has raised many eyebrows. 

 The admissions to the courses had courted controversy earlier as there were allegation of admission criteria being relaxed to help students' leaders of a students' organization.
 
 Officials said that after the master courses results were declared it was revealed that around 20 marks had increased in case of 70 students.
 
 The   students have demanded that if the marks of   leaders were increased, the GU should carry out a thorough investigation and get the papers evaluated again by the deans. The leaders claimed that according to the norms, if there was a change of more than 15% marks it was to be evaluated by another professor. But in all the 70 cases the   was only taking opinion of the deans.
