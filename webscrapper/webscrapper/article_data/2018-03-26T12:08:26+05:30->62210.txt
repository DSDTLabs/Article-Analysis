GUWAHATI:   president   on Sunday asked the state party leadership to reconsider the decision to go it alone in the panchayat election, reiterating the party's decision to keep its partnership with allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland People's Front (BPF) intact for the   election next year. 

 "He left it to the state committee to take the final call. But by asking the leaders to rethink the decision, Shah wanted to drive home the point that contesting the panchayat election alone does not send the right message to alliance partners who help script the saffron party's success in the assembly election," a senior BJP leader said.
