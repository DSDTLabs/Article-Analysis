Actress   says that "vulnerability" is a key factor in keeping her relationship with husband   "healthy".

 Bell posted a photograph of a hand-written note on  , which detailed six key points which help her keep things running smoothly with her 43-year-old spouse, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
 
 The note read: "Vulnerability always begets connection and intimacy. Stay vulnerable with each other. In 10 years, when the dopamine has waned, remember: life is a crazy ride. It's a privilege to go through it with a partner.
 
 "Take necessary separateness. It will make your marriage better. Loving someone despite their faults, failings, or character defects, is the most powerful loving thing you can do.
 
 "Rejoice in what makes the other person happy, and allow them their individual interests.
 
 "Know that everyone is doing the best they can with that they've got. So get a bigger emotional tool box to fix your problems."
