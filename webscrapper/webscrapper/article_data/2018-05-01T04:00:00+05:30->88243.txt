Rajkot: Two minor girls, aged five and seven years old, were allegedly molested by their relative in Navadhra village of Veraval taluka in Gir Somnath district on April 19. The complaint in this connection was lodged on Sunday night by the girls’ father. 

 The accused, identified as Pratap Bharada (26), was arrested soon after the complaint was lodged against him. “On April 19, both the girls who are siblings were playing at a farm when Bharada approached them. He lured them with offer of getting them corn and took them to the adjoining farm, where he sexually abused them,” said Prabhas Patan PSI J B Chawda. 
 
 “The girl started shouting and her father rushed to the spot. Bharada fled. As Bharada was their relative, the girls’ father was in dilemma on whether to lodge a complaint against him, fearing social stigma. However, he finally decided to file the plaint,” added Chawda.
