PADERU:   rural police have initiated a skill development programme called ‘Cheyuta’ (helping hands) aimed at empowering   - especially those from the interior pockets of Visakha agency that are infested by Maoists. Police will impart essential life skills and will try to wean them of their pro-Maoist ideology.

  sub-division of district police under the guidance of ASP Bardar initiated a month-long workshop where car driving lessons will be imparted to tribal unemployed youth of Maoist-infested mandals such as Munchingput, Pedabayalu and G. Madugula. 
 
 Around 56 unemployed tribal youth were selected for the training out of 250 who attended for the selections in the first phase. The training started at Youth Training Centre (YTC) in Paderu. The youth are given training that involves both classroom lectures as well as hands-on experience. “The lecture classes cover topics such as vehicle control and mechanism, road signs, motor vehicle laws, rules and others. We wish to provide opportunities to the tribal youth of interior places in the Visakha agency, so that they can get a livelihood,” Paderu ASP Bardar said.
 
 All the selected candidates would be given learning licenses free of cost and they would be provided permanent driving licenses after completion of training, these too for free. Police are providing free accommodation and food for the candidates. Local sub-inspector   and   community police are monitoring the training activity, sources said.
 
 Attempts have been made to make the entire programme interactive and emphasis has been given on active participation, police said.
 
 A month-long camp will be held where tribal youths will be taught life skills and driving lessons. They will be given free food and shelter, police said
