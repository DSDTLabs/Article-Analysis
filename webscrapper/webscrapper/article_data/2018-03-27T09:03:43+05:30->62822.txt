SHIVAMOGGA: BJP national president Amit Shah declared all’s well between sparring state leaders BS   and   by posing with them for a photo-op after dinner diplomacy here on Monday night.

 “We’ve declared Yeddyurappa as our CM candidate, and the entire party, including PM Modi, has approved of this,” Shah said as he projected the picture of unity. The dinner at Eshwarappa’s residence was to be only with Shah and Yeddyurappa. A last-minute surprise was RSS national secretary BL Santosh, the target of BSY’s barbs in the past.
 
 Earlier in the day, Shah arrived to a tumultuous welcome in the Malnad heartland, with thousands of supporters chanting “Modi, Modi!” He conducted a roadshow after offering prayers at a Ganesha temple. Every building was filled with women and children eager to catch a glimpse of the BJP leader.
 
 At the end of the rally, the BJP president said: “Having witnessed the wave of BJP support today, I am convinced it is not a wave but a tsunami that has arrived in Karnataka.”
