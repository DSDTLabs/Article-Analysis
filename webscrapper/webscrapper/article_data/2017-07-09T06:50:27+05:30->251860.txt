 “This is the first time since the Haj Act (2002) was implemented that there is no full-time CEO in the Haj Committee. Haj is so important to Muslims and yet this is being ignored. The CEO should be appointed immediately,“ said Sohail Lokhandwala, former vicechairman, Haj Committee. “It is quite shocking that the govern ment has not appointed the CEO even after the last CEO (Ataur Rahman) demitted office around a month ago. The   is not being accorded the importance it deserves as per its act,“ said Haji Ali Dargah's managing trustee Suhail Khandwani.
 
 Interviews for the CEO's job were held around a month ago but the appointment has been hanging fire since. Meanwhile, Md Shahbaz Ali, managing director,   & Finance Corporation (NMDFC), has been given the additional charge of Haj Panel's CEO. “Such a delay shows the callous attitude of the government towards issues of the minorities.

 Minority affairs minister   claimed, “A full-time CEO will be appointed soon. Haj operations are not getting affected.“
