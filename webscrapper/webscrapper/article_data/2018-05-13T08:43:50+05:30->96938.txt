KATHMANDU: India is ready to be the Sherpa to help Nepal scale the mountain of success, Prime Minister   said on Saturday, hailing the Himalayan nation's successful journey from bullets to ballots.

 
 Addressing a civic reception, Modi stressed on the special relationship shared by the two neighbours and admired Nepal's spirit of resilience and commitment towards democracy. "Nepal has covered a long journey from yuddh to buddh (war to peace). You have left the bullet for the ballot... But this not the destination. You have to go a long way," Modi told the gathering.
 
 "You have reached the base camp of Mt Everest and the main climb is yet to be done. As Sherpas help mountaineers to reach the top of Everest, India is ready to help Nepal like a Sherpa to achieve development," he said.
 
 Modi said Nepal must identify its needs and priorities to deliver results. "India will stand shoulder-to-shoulder to help Nepal in its development journey. Your success is our success and your joy is our joy." He said 'sabka saath, sabka vikas' is as much about global wellbeing as it's about India's growth.
 
 Choosing his words carefully, Modi appealed to hearts of the people in a bid to regain trust and reset relationship. He tried to heal wounds of the Madhesi border blockade without making any direct reference to it. Nepal leaders also avoided referring to the past. However, some 30 people belonging to a breakaway Maoist faction, including prominent leader CP Gajurel, were briefly arrested from Kathmandu while trying to protest against Modi's trip.
 
 Nepal foreign minister P K Gyawali termed Modi's visit "historic and successful". Nepal-India ties scaled new heights after Modi's visit, said Gyawali, who saw Modi off at Tribhuvan International Airport. AGENCIES
