TRICHY: Frustrated by the delay in setting up a separate quarry for   cart owners, a section of the owners interrupted the sand heaping process by an earthmover vehicle at a sand depot in   here on Monday. 

 As many as 30 bullock cart owners blocked the operations at the depot across   river. They forced the operator of the earthmover machine to stop heaping the sand for loading them on the trucks. 
 
 The sudden protest was the consequence of the public works department’s (PWD) mining division to identify a place to allot a separate quarry for the bullock cart owners. 
 
 The sand mining operations in four places resumed 10 days ago following the Supreme Court’s interim stay on the Madras high court’s ban on sand mining in Tamil Nadu in February this year. Panayakurichi was one of the four places.
 
 The officials said that they called them depots not quarries now because they were heaping the sand and supplying them to the trucks. 
 
 On getting the information about the protest, PWD officials rushed to the spot and held talks with the protesters. They pacified them by assuring a separate place soon following which they dispersed. 
 
 An official in the PWD mining division on condition of anonymity said an order has been issued to find out a suitable place within one or two km from Panayakurichi to set up an exclusive quarry to save the livelihood of the bullock cart owners. 
 
  from Vengur, Natarajapuram, Koothaippaar, Arasankudi, Thiruverumbur, Mullaikudi and Puthavaram villages in   in the district had already appealed to the district administration to save them from the adversities which was caused by the drought.
 
 The bullock cart owners had already expressed their dissatisfaction over the closure of sand quarries in Ayyalamman Padithurai and Sarkar Palayam areas across Cauvery river.
