 revealed himself to be a fan of AR Rahman recently. He admitted it himself by sharing pictures of the event where he shared the stage with ARR. 

 "Pictures from the A.R. Rahman show in Sharjah ! I was such a fanboy ! Sitting up front and center for such an epic show. Incredible performance by the maestro himself and lovingly supported by such amazing talent! Even the stage and the sound & lights were dazzling ! If anyone can put on a show, it's Rahman Sir!"
