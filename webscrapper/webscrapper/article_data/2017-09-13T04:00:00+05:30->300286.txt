Ahmedabad: Officials of Gujarat’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) cited Tuesday as one of the important days for the agency. As many as five bail applications were rejected by the courts on a single day. The ACB officials said that the prosecution of each case has been made stringent, resulting in denial of bail in almost every major corruption case, including the sensational Sumandeep Vidyapeeth graft case.

 The five cases included cases in Dahod, Vadodara, Surat and two cases of Mehsana. Two of the cases were for anticipatory bail while were regular bail applications and one was for bail after filing of charge-sheet. Keshav Kumar, director, ACB, said that the focus is now on professional and evidence-based investigation which is yielding results. 
 
 “A lot of emphasis is on use of forensic science and making the case stronger before it goes for hearing. We are also training our staff in understanding how the prosecution works to make the prosecution effective,” Kumar said.
 
 ACB officials said that traditionally the accused in corruption cases were sent on less than five days remand. This is another aspect which is changing rapidly. Officials said that a high number of cases have been registered against class I and II officials in 2017.
