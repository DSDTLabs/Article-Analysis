PATNA: Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal has ordered deduction of a day’s salary of 225 teachers of government high schools in the district, who were found absent during a random check by district officials on Thursday.

 The surprise inspection, ordered by the DM, was made by the SDOs, BDOs and COs at 75 schools in the 23 blocks of the district. It will continue as a campaign to improve the quality of education at the government schools, said the DM who himself inspected few schools in the district HQ town.
 
 The absentee teachers will also be issued show-cause notices, asking them to explain their unauthorized absence. “We came across cases of teachers who were described as habitual late-comers and also teachers who were said to have been absent for long even though they had not taken leave,” the DM told TOI.
 
 Agarwal reprimanded the district education officer and block education officers for dereliction of duty. “That so many teachers abstain from work in an unauthorized manner makes it clear that the education officials are not inspecting the schools,” the DM said.
 
 Agarwal reached the Shastri Nagar Girl’s High School at 10.20am and found 28 of the 30 teachers missing though their reporting time was 9.30am. Even at Shastri Nagar Boy’s High School, which has 13 sanctioned posts of teachers, only six were at work.
 
 At Miller High School, only one of the 19 teachers was found present whereas ten of the 17 teachers in the school’s intermediate section were not found on duty.
 
 Furious at the findings of the surprise inspections, the DM talked about the introduction of morning assembly in the government schools in the district. “The assembly will be held a la private schools, and attending it will be made compulsory not only for the students but also for every teacher on duty,” he said.
