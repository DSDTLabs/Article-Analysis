Mumbai: A day before the HSC examinations began, a commuting   was unleashed along the Harbour   as services between CST and Kurla were halted for over 16 hours on Monday after a lentil-laden goods   derailed between Wadala and GTB Nagar stations at 4.10am. A rail fracture is suspected to be the cause.

 Over 188 services on the   line between Kurla and CST were cancelled. Trains ran from Panvel to Kurla and commuters were allowed to change to the CR main line. It led to massive crowding at Kurla—usually jampacked at peak hours—and led to fears of a stampede. “I’ve never seen such chaos at Kurla, there was no space to stand at 10am. I abandoned plans to go to work as the trains were overcrowded,” said commuter Vaishali Sawant.
 
 The train disruption on the week’s first working day was compounded by refusals by auto and taxi drivers and steep surge pricing of up to over three times the normal fare by aggregator cabs. As desperate commuters took to the roads, long snarls awaited those trying to reach offices in south Mumbai, especially along the Eastern Freeway. The evening saw a repeat nightmare. BEST ran almost a hundred extra services along the affected routes to help cope with the rush.
 
  The railway   and the overhead wires were checked before normal services resumed after 8pm.
