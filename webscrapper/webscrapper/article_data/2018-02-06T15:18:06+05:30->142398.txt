Wondering how to get the hue right? We’ve got a step-by-step guide by Cosmetologist & Aesthetician Bharti Taneja to get it right on the day of love.

 Here’s how you can ace the pink make-up look this Valentine’s Day.
 
 
  Start playing with your look with a gel-based primer for a longer lasting effect of your make-up. Now, continue with applying a tinted moisturizer to even out your skin texture. Use a good concealer if you need to cover under-eye dark circles, acne spots or other scars. Then, apply a baby pink shade of cream blush over the apple of your cheeks. To set the base, use a matching compact powder at the end.
 
 
  The pink eye look will be giving you all the attention. To get it right, start with applying an eye-primer—for a smooth base. Now, apply a bubblegum (think pastel) pink eye-shadow on the inner eyelid and layer it with a fuchsia hue (darker pink) on the outer corner. For a bolder look, you can also add some contrast and go for an emerald green wing eye.
 
 
 
 
 
 
  For pouty lips, slather a rosy pink shade after using a lip plumper. But before applying the colour, make sure you define the lips well with a similar shade of lip liner. For lip colours, you can also try hues like lilac pink, cameo pink, coral pink and rose pink—for a sweeter look.
  
 
  Don’t forget your hair, try a romantic hairstyle like soft curls and get your partner’s attention. For this look, first apply a serum on washed hair; followed by curling it using tongs. If open hair is not your thing, you can also go for a messy bun. Start with applying a hair mousse on entire hair length and scrunch your tresses into a messy one. Now, tie it into a bun and secure it with a rubber band or bobby pins. Complete the look with a pink rose or some eye-catching accessories to adorn the hairstyle!
 
 Happy Valentine’s Day!
