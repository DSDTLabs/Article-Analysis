CHENNAI: The 48-day strike called by the   (TFPC) will end on Friday as advance bookings are already open for Karthik Subbaraj’s ‘Mercury’. Two more films may also release alongside the silent thriller on Friday, said TFPC president Vishal, after holding talks with the state government and other film industry unions on Wednesday.

 Film shoots that had been suspended for a month will also resume from Friday. “It was not a strike or a shutdown. It was a revamp aimed at structuring the film industry and levelling the playing field to favour small-budget producers. From June, the film trade will become more transparent than ever,” said Vishal. 
 
 To ensure both small and big-budget films get equal space at the box office, the   have decided to form a release regulation committee which will allot release dates to producers months ahead. To encourage small-budget films and attract people of lower economic backgrounds back to the theatres, producers, theatre owners, and distributors have got the state government’s consent to reduce prices as per the market demand generated by each film.
 
 Movie ticket prices will be capped at Rs 150. “The price of a ticket could be reduced to Rs 50 if the producer feels it will bring in larger crowds. To reduce the burden on producers, we have cut the cost of virtual print fee (VPF) charged by digital service providers (DSP) by 50%,” said Vishal. In interest of transparent box office collection reports, TPFC will establish a centralised server which will monitor ticket sales and footfall in all 1,112 theatres in the state.
 
 Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI) president   said, “The changes that have been brought in by TFPC will reduce the cost of production and exhibition by 20-40%.”
 
 Rajinikanth-starrer ‘Kaala’ which was set for an April 27 release is set to be delayed. “Kamal Haasan was eyeing a May release for his film ‘Vishwaroopam 2’. It looks like it may get postponed now,” said Vishal.
