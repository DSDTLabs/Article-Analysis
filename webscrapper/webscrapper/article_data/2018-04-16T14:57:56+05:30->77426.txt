MYSURU:   leader B Y  , who is seeking to make inroads into the   bastion of   segment, on Sunday continued his efforts and had lunch at a   community family at Rayanahundi during campaigning.

 Vijayendra, a Lingayat leader who is holding roadshows in Mysuru and Nanjangud taluks, focused his campaigning at Hundis where the Kuruba community is concentrated. After his poll managers chalked out campaigning for the day, they got an invite from a Kuruba family, asking Vijayendra to lunch with them, his aides said.
 
 Vijayendra had lunch at Ramanna’s house at Rayanahundi, BJP Slum Morcha general secretary Raghu told TOI. He had invited BJP leaders and Vijayendra accepted it, he claimed. The lunch is aimed at reaching out to the community. Kurubas are in sizable numbers in Varuna segment, spread across Mysuru, Nanjangud and T Narsipur taluks, represented by CM Siddaramaiah. The Congress is fielding Yathindra Siddaramaiah, a Kuruba leader.
 
 Vijayendra targeted CM Siddaramaiah, saying he is trying to muzzle the Dalit leadership in the state, and said he has also neglected Dalits in the segment. At roadshows, he sought to know the CM’s contribution for the welfare of Dalit communities. “Voters should understand his ploy in denying Dalit leadership,” he told villagers as he crisscrossed the segment, visiting Maranahundi, Koodanahalli, Kochanahalli, Basallihundi, Someshwarapura, Kumbrahalli Math, Ayarahalli, Marigowdanahundi, Devalapura and Chikkagowdanahundi villages.
