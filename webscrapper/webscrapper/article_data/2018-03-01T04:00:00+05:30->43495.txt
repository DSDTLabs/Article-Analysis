Vadodara: Mukesh Rajai, who was arrested by Mahila police station, from his home in Godhra last week in connection with a rape and sexual harassment case registered here applied for bail in sessions court here on Wednesday. 
 
 Rajai, a cloth trader in Godhra, stated in his bail plea that the complaint against him was cooked up by the complainant. He said that according to the complainant, she and Rajai were studying together in tuition classes at Godhra 19 years ago and before she got married to another men living in Kenya, they were in a relationship. But Rajai told the court that 19 years ago that is in 1998-99, he did not meet the complainant and he had stopped studying in 1995 after he failed in class X. 
  
 Rajai also mentioned in his bail plea that the complainant woman was referring to obscene photos of her from 19 years back which he used for blackmailing her for having physical relationship with him. But mobile phones entered Indian market in 2002 and camera phones came even later therefore it was unlikely that he would have taken photos of her 19 years ago, his bail plea stated. 
  
 The court will hear his bail plea on Thursday. 
  
 The woman, who resides in Bapod, had lodged complaint against Rajai on February 21 at Mahila police station. She had informed the police that when she was living in Godhra, Rajai had forcefully taken her obscene photos and when she had returned from Kenya in June 2014, Rajai blackmailed her using those photos and allegedly coerced her to build physical relationship with him. Rajai had allegedly also taken Rs 30,000 first and then Rs 85,000 from the woman using those photos. Recently, when he demanded Rs 5 lakh from her, she approached the police.
