PATNA:   would soon set up 74 cybercrime and social media units (CCSMU) in 38 districts, including five in Patna by the end of this year, inspector general of police (IG) (economic offences and cybercrime wing) J S Gangwar said on Saturday.

 Addressing students at a workshop on ‘Role of Information Technology in Curbing Cybercrime’ organized by Anugrah Narayan College, the IG claimed the home department had been working for two years to set up a full-fledged cyber cell in the state. 
 
 “Few days ago, the state government gave its nod for creation of CCSMUs in 38 districts and two police districts —   and Bagaha. Each unit, with one inspector, three sub-inspectors, two constables and four computer professionals, will be functional in six to eight months,” Gangwar said.
 
 According to sources, one state-level cyber cell is already functional under the economic offences unit of the Bihar police.
 
 The IG further said, “In Uttar Pradesh, there are only two cyber cell units, while Mumbai has such cells only in city areas. Bihar, however, is the first state that will have cyber units in each district.”
 
 Besides, the home department is working on a cyber literacy programme that will see the light of day in four months. 
 
 “According to a study, teens in the age group of 14-17 years spend most of their time on social media and usually become victims of cybercrime. We will target this age group and visit colleges and schools in Patna and other districts to spread awareness about cybercrime with the help of modules, booklets and audio-visual CDs,” the IG said. 
 
 He also urged A N College authorities to create a cyberwarrior cadre and teach students about the Information Technology Act.
 
 College principal Shashi Pratap Shahi, IT department head Shailendra Kumara and other faculty members also attended the workshop.
