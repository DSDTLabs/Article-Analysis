SURAT:   (SMC) has started the process to begin laying a 1,300 km fibre-to-home network, which will make the city an attractive destination for businesses with its super-fast internet connectivity. The local body intends to provide high-speed internet, faster than 15 Mbps, at the prices other providers charge for  . This will speed up SMC’s citizen services and give schools and hospitals better  . Tenders for this project were opened by SMC and work on the ground will begin in two months.

 “Under the smart city programme, we want to empower Surat and its citizens with broadband wire line penetration. We will not do it as a business but will provide citizens services, so it will be highly affordable,” said M  , special commissioner in-charge of  .
 
 This essentially means that if every household today spends Rs 500 a month on net connectivity, SMC will provide fibre to home at the same price with a much higher speed.
 
 SMC plans to provide for local entrepreneurs, making them WiFi providers, thus helping the economy and generating employment as well.
 
 “For businesses to flourish, this fibre-to-home network will create a basic ecosystem so connectivity improves along with living standards and people can do their business quicker, from anywhere,” said Nagarajan. 
 
 The network will be 3,000km long when complete. It will raise the speed of citizen services and will help e-learning at schools. Hospitals will also be better facilitated.
 
 With the fibre-to-home network, SMC plans to provide full infrastructure in a single expense, which it could recover by leasing out the ducts created while laying the network.
 
 Surat will be the first of the 20 smart cities selected by the government of India to have fibre-to-home. 
 
 “After completing the official procedures, we expect to start laying fibre lines and creating ducts in two-three months,” said an SMC official.
