Nagpur: With the aim to reduce  , city traffic police convened a meeting of the representatives of private bus operators on Saturday to plan ways to reduce the nuisance on the roads caused by the buses.

 Ravindrasinh Pardesi, deputy commissioner police (Traffic), said, “Numerous problems are arising related to traffic in the city, with almost all major square facing the chaos. Areas such as Manas Square, Rahate Colony Square, Baidhyanath Square, Central Avenue and Bhole Petrol Pump Square are the hotspots to name a few. One of the major cause is the congestion due to buses.”
 
 The DCP also pointed out that buses tend to stop on the roads occupying nearly half of the space. “Due to such attitude, traffic increases giving rise to quarrels and fights. Thus a permanent solution is needed to address the menace,” he said.

 Pardeshi informed TOI that they have planned in accordance with Nagpur Municipal Corporation to provide bus station outside the city, where the buses won’t crowd the roads. We have asked private bus operators to set up booking offices in the city but the buses should be kept outside city limits.
 
 Jayesh Bhandarkar, senior inspector said the initiative aims at helping citizens to minimize traffic and promote smooth travelling along with traffic awareness.
