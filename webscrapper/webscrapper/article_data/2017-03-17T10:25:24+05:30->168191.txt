NAGPUR: After an easy  , straight forward Geometry was like an icing on the cake for the students.

 Purushottam Panchbhai, president, Nagpur District Mathematics  , said that Math 2 (Geometry) was easy compared to the last year’s paper.
 
 “I saw happiness among students after the paper. It was very easy. Even an average student can attempt it. Questions were easy to understand and did not create confusions. It was a good paper for those aiming to just pass as well as those wanting to score,” he said.
 
 Mayank Bajpayee, a student, was able to solve the paper within time. “I was at peace after I saw the paper. I did not expect it to be so easy. I had practised the important question and luckily they appeared in the paper,” he added.
 
 Meenal, another student, said that she had not prepared well but the paper was a smooth sail. “I could not attempt all the questions, especially the long ones but I’m not worried. I’m confident about the questions that I solved,” she said.
 
 “Both the Maths papers were easy and straight forward. I always feared geometry but this time I cannot complain. I think nobody should complain because we are getting such a paper in the board exam. I completed my paper 30 minutes before the deadline,” Praveen Malhotra said while exiting the exam centre.
 
 Shweta Patel said that it was an average paper. “I don’t like Maths. So it was an ordinary paper for me. I will pass the exam but I’m not sure about scoring good. I made some mistakes in the long questions,” she said.
 
 Student Rajat Bansod, another student, said, “I'm satisfied with my performance. The paper was easy. It was not lengthy. Short as well long questions were very straightforward and familiar.”
