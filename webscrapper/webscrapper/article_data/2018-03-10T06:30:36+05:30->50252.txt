PHULPUR: The last day of campaigning saw a spat between SP and   over their failure to continue with the alliance that they had forged in UP elections last year, with one blaming the other for it. While UP Congress president   said that his party had initiated the process for a grand alliance for the bypolls and blamed SP and   for leaving it out, SP President   refuted his allegations. 

 Talking to TOI on Friday, Babbar said that despite his party's willingness to contest on one seat only in arrangement with the SP, there was no response from Akhilesh. "We even offered SP that we can withdraw one of our candidates. Our leaders spoke to SP and BSP both. But it didn't work out," added Babbar.
 
 Akhilesh, however, denied Congress had made any such proposal. "Where? When? (Babbar's comments) This is a complete lie. No one from Congress approached us on any tie-up. Still, I have no malice towards them, even though their attitude had changed after the Gujarat elections where their party achieved moderate success. I have a lot of respect for them,"   told TOI.
 
 Babbar maintained that only Congress could pick up a direct fight with the BJP, whether it was national or state politics. "Congress is a national party. If anyone can fight the BJP, its Congress's values based on Gandhian principles," Babbar told TOI on the last day of campaigning. Babbar, who has earlier been part of SP, also said that neither his party nor he had any regrets for the 2017 tie-up for the assembly polls.
 
 "There is no mistake either in the past or now. On the contrary, we have a straight fight. Now, we are not fighting via anyone. If anyone can fight BJP, it's us" Babbar said.
