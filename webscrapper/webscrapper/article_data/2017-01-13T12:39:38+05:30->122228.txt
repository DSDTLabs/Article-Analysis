AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court is likely to pass an order on Friday, a day ahead of Uttarayan, on various public interest litigations ( ) seeking complete ban on glass-coated cotton thread ( ) and Chinese thread during the kite flying festival.

 Three petitioners have been demanding ban on glass-coated thread, kite flying activity on the festival or limiting the kite flying activity to certain days in order to curb hazards for people riding on two wheelers as well as for birds. One of the petitioners   has demanded a complete ban on manja on the ground that the   has banned it and the authorities are not implementing the order.
 
 Earlier, the state government fully supported the festivities of kite flying in Gujarat and said that without the glass-coated cotton thread, the kite flying would be virtually impossible on Uttarayan.
 
 The state government told the   that it has already banned the Chinese manja, which is made of metallic/nylon/yarn and abrasive coat of crushed glass gummed on it makes it razor sharp. The decision of banning Chinese manja would take care of most of the grievances raised in the PILs.
 
 In an affidavit filed before the court last month, the state government had submitted that Uttarayan is the biggest festival of the state and thousands of families earn their livelihood in the cottage industry of making kites and preparing manja.
 
 The government stressed on the religious and cultural importance of Uttarayan and said that the festival of kite flying is beyond the religious boundaries. It also defended use of cotton thread manja by stating that kite flying is not possible with cotton thread without coating. Any restriction on such thread would virtually be curtailing the entire kite flying festival.
