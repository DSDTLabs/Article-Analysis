NEW DELHI: The Delhi government went beyond its jurisdiction when it decided to set up a single unified system for   operations, said the three-member committee set up by former   Najeeb Jung. Only the governor has the authority to decide if such a system is required, it added. 

 According to the committee, the government's decision infringed the power of other agencies or duplicated their functions. 
 
 The decision "has more to do with the subject of land, which does not lie with the government of Delhi", the report stated, adding that not all agencies involved in digging operation comes under the ambit of the Delhi government. 
 
 "It is really for the lieutenant governor to decide whether it is necessary to create a unified system in perhaps the revenue department, which oversees the districts because this function can be efficiently discharged within the boundaries of a district," the committee pointed out. 
 
 Referring to the irregularities in a decision on demolition activities, the panel said that on February 16, 2015, the urban development ministry, on the direction of deputy chief minister  , issued an order asking all agencies to stop such activities in residential houses, jhuggis etc "till further instructions". This order was issued, the committee said, though it was known that the agencies removing encroachments do not report to the elected government. 
 
 When various agencies that do not report to the elected government are involved, the lieutenant governor should consider the proposals and will be the deciding authority, the committee concluded.
