MUMBAI: The CST GRP are probing a complaint of a man entering the first-class ladies compartment of a   on Thursday evening and performing stunts. There was a lone woman travelling in the compartment at that time. Women travelling in the adjacent second-class compartment shouted at the man to get off but he ignored them. A media professional in the second-class coach shot a video clip of the man. 

 “Around 6pm, the man had boarded the first-class   at Kurla...the sole woman traveller was scared. She wanted to get off but he wouldn’t let her. He kept performing stunts hanging out of the door,” the media professional said. 
 
 “I called up the helpline but the cops landed up in the wrong coach.” Even after the train reached CST, the man didn’t get off. “After a male commuter shouted at him, he finally got off of the compartment,” she said. 
 
 The police will track down the man identified in the video clip and   footage from CST.
