GANDHINAGAR: Congress MLAs were suspended for the   once again, after they came to the assembly wearing aprons   against BJP national president Amit Shah. On Friday, as soon as the house began, Congress MLAs got on their feet wearing gowns with slogans. The MLAs, who had decided not to speak, demanded an apology from   for giving a political speech in the assembly on Thursday. Amidst the protest, deputy chief minister Nitin Patel tabled the Justice MP Shah Commission’s report. The commission was formed to look into allegations of corruption against Narendra Modi who was then chief minister.

 When chief minister   said the Shah panel had given a clean chit to Modi, Congress MLAs entered the well of the house with banners and demanded an apology from Amit Shah for his political speech.
 
 The Speaker said he was willing to consider the Congress demands whatever they were and asked the party’s MLAs to call off their protest. 
 
 However when the Congress MLAs ignored the advice of the Speaker, minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja moved the proposal to suspend the Congress MLAs for the entire day. The proposal was accepted with majority vote.
 
 The Congress MLAs who had rushed to the well of the House were then shifted out by the security staff.
