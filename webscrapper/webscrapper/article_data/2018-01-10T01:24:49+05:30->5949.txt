NEW DELHI: The sealing drive has reached Chandni Chowk. The north corporation has   over 100   to   operating on several internal roads in Roshanpura and neighbouring markets. Senior officials said around 500 notices had been issued in the six zones of the corporation.

 Besides mixed land-use streets and local shopping areas, pedestrian shopping streets (with width less than 6m) and smaller shops will also be covered during the drive. 
 
 According to Master Plan 2021, all of them will have to pay conversion charges.
 
 Most of the shops have received notices for non-payment of conversion charges. The building department has asked the shopkeepers to either submit a proof of payment or pay the dues in the next three days while the traders on the main road have also been told to submit the property proof showing that the ownership is of the pre-1962 period.
 
 Sanjay Bhargav, general secretary of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said the main road had been the commercial street since the period of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and the action was unjustified. “There should be no doubt about the status of the main street. If proof or documents are asked, we will reply accordingly.”
 
 He also slammed the corporation for serving notices on establishments on internal roads. “This is a special area. Even the Supreme Court has said in its judgments that if a legislation about this area is not passed, the authorities can’t take conversion or parking charges,” Bhargav argued. 
 
 Senior corporation officials said they were taking action against people who had not paid the conversion charge.
