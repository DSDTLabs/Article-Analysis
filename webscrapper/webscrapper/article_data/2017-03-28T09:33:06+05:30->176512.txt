BENGALURU: The unusual traffic markings like a zig-zag line or checkered yellow patterns at several junctions in the city might have already caught your attention. Puzzled, many citizens have been writing to cops, prompting them to even release   explaining the markings.

 The zig-zag line indicates pedestrian crossings ahead, and   can't stop or halt in the area covered by the marking. The yellow-checkered patterns, also known as yellow boxes, indicate the area where motorists have to mandatorily clear the road and not stop.
 
 R  , additional commissioner of police (traffic) said these were always part of the guidelines for road marking, but hardly used.
 
 “The aim is to ensure pedestrian safety and decongest the city's junctions. The zigzag lines are meant for the safety of pedestrians. Motorists have this habit of parking or stopping their vehicles near the junction, thus blocking the vision of pedestrians crossing the road. If we are able clear the areas near pedestrian crossings, accidents can be brought down,“ he pointed out.
 
 The  , however, are meant to keep the junctions clear. Motorists piling up at intersections with chock-a-block traffic ahead and blocking the movement of vehicles in other directions is a common sight in  .The yellow box makes it clear that you may enter the junction only when your exit is clear and there's enough space on the other side of the junction, police said.
 
 Most junctions with yellow boxes and zig-zag lines are zerotolerance junctions. There are 11 such junctions in the city and 40 more are expected soon. On Saturday, 1,800 cases were book ed at these junctions alone.
 
 “We have both cameras and personnel on the ground making sure that every violation in these zero-tolerance junctions are booked. With our efforts showing results, we will be expanding it further,“ Hitendra pointed out.
