CHANDIGARH: As the nationwide protest by farmers entered its third day, vegetable markets are taking a hit in Chandigarh and Mohali. Farmers at the local kisan mandis on Sunday were worried about union activists not coming to the cities with the produce.

 The situation is alarming, said a vendor in kisan mandi in Sector 34. “Today, we have received very less quantity of vegetables from   side and are not primarily dependent upon the produce from   and down South,” he said.
 
 Krishan Kant, a wholesaler in Sector 26 grain market said, “There has been a fluctuation in prices from past one week, but after the strike the prices of tomatoes and potatoes have shot up as these produces come from Punjab. We fear that there will be short supply of vegetables from   side and if the situation remains the same, the city will face an acute shortage of vegetables. The stocks are perishing.”
 
 The sellers in kisan mandis said that they are being restricted to bring their produce from the neighbouring areas of Punjab.
