GORAKHPUR: UP minister   has accused Muslim men of using the triple talaq to remarry for “satiating their lust”. 

 Talking to mediapersons in Basti on Friday evening, Maurya said, “BJP Muslim mahilaaon ke saath khadi hai-...jo akaaran...bewajah, aur manmaane tareeqe se jab chaha talaq de diya, apni havas ko poora karne ke liye lagataar patniyan badalne ka kaam kare, apne hi bachchon, patniyon ko sadak pe bheekh maangne par majboor kar de usey na aap achchha kahenge na koi aur (BJP stands with those Muslim women who are divorced by their husbands for no rhyme or reason. No one can support a man who continuously changes wives to satiate his lust, leaving the divorced woman and her kids to beg on the streets).” 
 
 A video of the controversial statement made by Maurya is doing the rounds. TOI tried to contact the minister till late in the evening, but he was not available. 
 
 Muslim clerics have demanded an apology from Maurya for his statement. Former UP minister and SP leader Mohammad Azam Khan said, “Such a cheap statement merits no response.” Once considered to be a close aide of Mayawati, Maurya left BSP before the UP assembly polls and joined BJP.
