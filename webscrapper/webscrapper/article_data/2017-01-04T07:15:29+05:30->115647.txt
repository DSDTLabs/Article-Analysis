AHMEDABAD: It seems the   (GU) convocation may be postponed beyond January 10 as the chief guest of the event,   will not be able to attend due to issues of protocol and security.

 Sources said that Prime Minister   will be in Gandhinagar for Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) 2017, due to which security will be beefed up in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. If the home minister comes on the same date, then it will become difficult to maintain security.
 
 “As the home minister is next to the Prime Minister in the hierarchy, he will have to remain in Delhi to manage the country’s affairs. Besides, Gujarat governor O P Kohli, who is GU chancellor, and education minister  , both will be attending the VGGS, so they will not be able to come to the GU convocation,” said sources. 
 
 The GU convocation is generally held in October and November, but as name of the chief guest could not be confirmed, it got delayed.
 
 GU Vice Chancellor,   said, “We have told him to decide a date between January 1 to 12 and he had fixed it on January 10. Due to some problems, convocation is likely to be postponed again.”
