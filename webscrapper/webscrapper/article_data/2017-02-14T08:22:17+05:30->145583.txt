 The start-up Contraceptive on Wheels to be launched on Valentine’s Day on Tuesday will donate the proceeds from its first month’s operations to   that works for   and  .
 
 The start-up is a brainchild of Arjun Jain, who is a student of the post-graduate diploma in marketing management at MSU and also works for prominent private sector company. 
 
 Another start-up handling doorstep deliveries in the city conceived by an MSU BBA student Aditya Vora will be handling the deliveries.
 
 “Almost all of us have faced embarrassment or an awkward moment while visiting the chemist to buy such products. This is particularly the case with women. We will be providing free deliveries initially and then charge nominal amounts for delivery. I discussed the project with Lakshya Trust founder and prince of Rajpipla, Manvendra Singh Gohil who liked it,” said Jain.
 
 Jain said that those wishing to buy products will be able to do so through messages on a facebook page, SMS and Whatsapp round the clock. 
 
 The service promises to ensure that the deliveries will be discreet and the identity of the customers will be protected. The service will accept payments through cash on delivery or e-wallets.
 
 Jain pointed out that he was not looking at the service as a profit making initiative. The initiative is looking to promote safe sex and not look into earnings immediately.
