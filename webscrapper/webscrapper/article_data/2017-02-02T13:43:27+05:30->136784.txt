NAGPUR: Everyone in the   is excited about the   this year, though they expected more share of   after demonetisation.

 North Nagpur MLA Dr Milind Mane feels eradication of tuberculosis, leprosy, measles and filariases through a time bound program is a good start. “Eradicating TB and leprosy will be tough, mainly due to the drug-resistant bacteria.”
 
 Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society (NOGS) president Dr Anuradha Ridhorkar said, “Action plan prepared to reduce infant mortality rate (IMR) from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019 and maternal mortality rate (MMR) from 167 in 2011-13 to 100 by 2018-20 are achievable if the decisions taken during budget are executed properly.”
 
 The budget also promises Rs 6,000 to pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children. Dr Ridhorkar said, “This will encourage women living in rural areas to opt for institutional delivery, which is much safer.”
 
 Deputy director (health) Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said the move to transform 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres into Health and Wellness Centres is welcome, as it will develop medical facilities at remote places. 
 
 Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital medical superintendent Dr SP Manjrekar welcomed the move of creating 5,000 additional PG seats, while she opposed the decision to start DNB course at district hospitals. “A medical college and a district hospital have different norms and approaches. Students will definitely get hands on training but the theoretical aspect will be affected; the hospitals will not have qualified staff to guide them with research work.”
 
 Orange City Hospital and Research Institute director Dr Anup Marar said, “Generic medicine supply through 3,000 Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojna is a welcome step.”
 
  Efforts to ensure supply of good quality medicines with accountability is crucial. Those who deal with spurious drugs should be treated as criminals and charged with murder.”
 
 He said, “The reduction of cost of medical devices is also good, as it will help needy people get treatment.” However, far more share of GDP was expected for health sector in this budget after demonetisation, he said.
