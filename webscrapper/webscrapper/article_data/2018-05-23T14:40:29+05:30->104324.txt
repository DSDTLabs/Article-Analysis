PANAJI: The agriculture department has slated new varieties of paddy and brinjal for trial this   season. Seeds of the   varieties of paddy and wilt-resistant brinjal will be distributed among farmers this monsoon besides the annual drill of giving out vegetable and pulses’ seeds.

 
 In April last year, TOI had reported about the salt-tolerant rice varieties Goa Dhan I and Goa Dhan II developed by the ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI), Old Goa. The institute also came up with a new variety of brinjal — 262-4 brinjal — that has been scientifically developed to grow without being susceptible to bacterial wilt. 
 
 “We are preparing to try out the new paddy varieties which have been approved by the ICAR-CCARI, Old Goa. The agriculture sub-officers will initiate these varieties. We will be trying out the wilt-resistant 262-4 brinjal once the ICAR-CCARI releases it,” said agriculture director  .
 
 The agriculture department will also be giving out 300 to 350 tonnes of paddy seeds to farmers for the kharif season. Roughly, 1.7 lakh tonnes of paddy are harvested in Goa per year. Vegetable seeds have already been ordered by the department as well. 
 
 About one tonne of each seed of monsoon vegetables such as lady finger, cucumber, rich gourd, bottle gourd and radish will be distributed among farmers. Six tonnes of groundnut seeds and a tonne of chilli seeds will also be given to them. Pulses of various kinds have also been ordered; half a tonne of the same will be disbursed.
 
 In addition to the new paddy and brinjal varieties, the department is also looking at experimenting with a new moong variant. “Though the regular moong varieties grow well in Goan soil and climate, we want bolder seeds that have greater marketability and a bigger grain size,” Figueiredo said adding that the pulse may see a path for germination in the next season.
