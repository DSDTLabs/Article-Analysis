NEW DELHI: The  's five-member collegium headed by CJI Dipak Misra on Wednesday could not reach a consensus on names to be recommended for appointment as SC judges, along with reiteration of the proposal to elevate Uttarakhand Chief Justice K M Joseph to the apex court. 

  At the May 11 meeting of the collegium, comprising CJI Misra and Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and  , it was unanimously decided to reiterate the proposal to elevate Justice K M Joseph. The Centre had sent back  's name for reconsideration. Though the decision to reiterate the name was taken, it wasn't sent to the government as most members felt it would be incongruous to send a single name when there were seven SC vacancies. 
 
  The collegium had earlier decided to consider other names from various high courts for appointment as SC judges and had deferred the deliberations to May 16. 
 
  On Wednesday, there was a detailed discussion in the collegium but sources said no unanimity was reached on names that could be recommended for appointment as SC judges. As a result, this delayed the proposal on appointment of Justice K M Joseph. 
 
  With the SC going for a summer break from May 18 till July 3, and Justice Chelameswar retiring on June 23, there is some uncertainty about when the collegium will meet again. During the May 11 meeting of the collegium, sources said Justices Chelameswar and Kurian Joseph had pitched strongly for reiteration of Justice K M Joseph's name and insisted on sending his name alone to the government for quick elevation to the SC. 
 
  However, Justice Gogoi, who will succeed Justice Misra on October 3 as CJI, and Justice Lokur had agreed with CJI Misra that when there were seven vacancies in the SC, it would be incongruous for the collegium to send only one name to the government.
