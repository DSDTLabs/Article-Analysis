Imagine what the world of rap would have been, if it did not have   in it. The 44-year-old rapper took to   to pay a tribute to his fellow rapper   on his birthday and also revealed that there was once a 50 Cent verse so good that it made him consider dropping out of the rap game altogether.

 In the video, Eminem said, "Yo, Fif, first off, I wanna say happy birthday. Secondly, I want to remind you of a verse you did that made me want to quit rapping."
 
  
  
 The ' Berzerk' hit-maker then rapped, "Picture a perfect picture, picture me in the paper, picture me starting shit, picture me busting my gat, picture police man dey ain't gotta picture of that. Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back. You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target jack."
 
 And after finishing the verse from the song, Eminem noted, "Yeah, so, that made me want to stop rapping, for like a long time." 50 Cent was quick to reply as he posted the same video on his Instagram account, thanking Eminem for the wishes.
 
  
  
 Eminem is set to headline this year's Reading and Leeds Festivals, which takes place on the weekend of August 25 to 27 at Richfield Avenue, and Bramham Park.
