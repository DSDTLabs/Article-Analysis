GURUGRAM: The state government has started the ground work to build a   in Gurgaon around two months after laying foundation for a university in the city. A 40-acre site has been earmarked, and the authorities claim that in the next couple of months a detailed project report will be prepared soon to set up the medical college.

 The proposal to have a medical college in Gurgaon was announced by chief minister   last month during his visit to the city. He had announced that cost of construction and management of the medical college will be shared by MCG, Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority ( ) and   Devi Shrine Board, which runs the Sheetla Mata temple.
 
 “The preliminary work to set up a medical college in the city has begun, and the state health department has approved a site in Sector 102 near  . Of the total cost of the project, MCG will bear 40%, GMDA 40% and the shrine board 20%. In the first phase of the project, we intend to offer around 150 MBBS seats,” said a district official.
 
 “Other details such as total cost of the entire project and the time period that will be required to construct this college will be taken into account in the detailed project report, which should be ready in next two-three months. The MCG has already done its bit by identifying the location. It will also share part of the financial burden. The college will be run by a trust, comprising members of Sheetla Mata broad, GMDA and MCG. The GMDA will be undertaking the planning of this project,” the official said.
 
 The medical college, according to sources, will also have a 750-bed hospital. “The detailed project report, which is being prepared, will include a plan to have a 750-bed hospital in the same campus. However, the main focus is to have the medical college ready in the first phase so that the course can start at the earliest and the student’s enrollment can begin. We will start the construction of the hospital also simultaneously,” said a source.
