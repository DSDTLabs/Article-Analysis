HYDERABAD:Officials of the north zone task force on Tuesday busted an ‘expired medicine’ racket and seized medicines worth Rs 10 lakh from the warehouse of a private pharmaceutical company.

 According to the task force officials, tetanus vaccine medicines belonging to a company named Dano Vaccines & Biologicals Private Limited, Ghatkesar, were found in the warehouse. Instead of sending the damaged vaccine bottles back to the firm, the vaccines are repacked in a warehouse at   under unhygienic conditions, they added.
 
 “When we raided the   printing press premises in Amberpet today (Tuesday), we noticed that the pharma company is repacking the damaged tetanus vaccines bottles. As the vaccines are not being stored at the required temperature, most of them must have expired by now,” said sub-inspector  , north zone task force, adding that the raid was conducted following a tip-off.
 
 
  
  
 
 He added, “A case has been registered under Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940 and notices are served to the director of the company  .”
 
 While the SI confirmed that the sleuths have seized all the vaccine bottles and sent the samples to the laboratory for necessary tests, officials feared that vaccines, if administered, could endanger the lives of children as well as adults.
 
 When contacted, independent doctors said that administering of expired medicines might fail to have the desired effect. “It might not cause immediate death as even expired medicines have a safe window. If administered within that window, it might still protect the receiver against the disease. However, after the safe window lapses, it won’t have the desired impact,” said Kishor Kumar Jaishi, a paediatrician with Maxcure Hospitals.
 
 He further said this may be life-threatening in some cases as people assume that they are protected against a disease, but have no clue that they are administered an expired one, which is basically ineffective.
