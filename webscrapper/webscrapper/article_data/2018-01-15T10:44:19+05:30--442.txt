PUNE: The government has done away with merchant discount rate charges on card swipes, BHIM   and Aadhaar-enabled Payment System transactions (AePS) for transactions up to Rs 2,000 for two years. This means no charges will be levied on card swipes at PoS terminals below this value.

 This is a much needed fillip for digital transaction, especially low value transaction, which the government says comprise a “sizeable chunk” of overall digital payments.
 
 After the initial push that demonetisation gave to adoption of digital payments, the return of cash has meant that the growth has floundered.
 
 
  
 
 According to the RBI data, the overall consumer-related digital transaction volume growth as on October 2017 was lower in percentage terms as compared to the same month last year.
 
 High charges are an impediment to growth of digital payments with merchants demanding a 1.5-2% charge from customers, thereby dissuading them from swiping cards. The removal of charges has been long thought off as a means to push digital payment.
 
 “What demonetisation could not achieve, removal of   might help in giving a boost to digital payments,” said a leading fintech expert with a research agency.
 
 “When payment is made at a merchant point of sale, MDR is payable by the merchant to the bank. Citing this, many people make cash payments in spite of having debit cards. Similarly, MDR is charged on payments made to merchants through   platform and AePS,” the government had said in its announcement on December 15, 2017.
 
 However, the message has not percolated down to shopkeepers and the public at large. The government has not yet pushed this as a benefit to merchants and customers.
 
 “Not many merchants know this. The government must drive home this message aggressively. Otherwise, the move might not yield much result,” said  , a financial expert. The government said it will compensate banks for any loss arising out of this announcement.
