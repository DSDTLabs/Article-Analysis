MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has directed   to publish the result of a final year student, which was withheld after police registered a case against him. 

 Justice M S Ramesh gave this direction to the college on a petition filed by  . The petitioner wanted a direction to the college to publish his exam results for MBBS final year Part-II degree examination, February 2018 and consequently direct the college to permit him to continue his further course of studies, namely compulsory rotary residential internship (CRRI). 
 
 The petitioner was allegedly involved in a road accident, thereby a criminal case was registered against him by a traffic intelligence wing,   city. Seeking to quash the case, the student filed a case before the high court bench which granted a stay over the investigation. The case is pending now. In view of the case, the college first refused to issue him hall ticket. When he came to the court, it ordered the college to issue hall ticket. Later, it withheld the results. 
 
 After hearing it, the judge said, “It is rather unfortunate that the college had for the second time quoted the pendency of the criminal proceedings as a bar to withhold the hall ticket and the results. In the absence of any legal provision, withholding of results is not only improper but also illegal.” The judge also said no stretch of imagination would empower the college to quote the proceedings and create inconvenience to by withholding his results or any other academic benefits.
