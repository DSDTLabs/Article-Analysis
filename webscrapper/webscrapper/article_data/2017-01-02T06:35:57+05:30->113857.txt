NAGPUR: The state government has come up with another scheme to reduce the hassles of citizens in obtaining government documents. Now you can get several documents at your home just by paying an additional charge of Rs 15.

 A government press release stated that people will no longer be required to go to   to collect certificates for non-creamy layer, caste, age, domicile and nationality. The applicant just has to pay Rs 15 extra to get it at home while paying the fee for the concerned  . The scheme will start from January 2. It has been started on pilot basis in Nagpur city for two months. This facility will be provided in rest of the district after that.
 
 The move may reduce the menace of touts in Setu Kendras. In spite of repeated attempts of senior district administration officials, the menace has persisted due to nexus between the touts and Setu Kendra employees.
