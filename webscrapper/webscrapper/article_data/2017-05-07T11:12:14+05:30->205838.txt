PUNE: A 25-year-old man allegedly stabbed a married woman to death and committed suicide at her residence in Adarshnagar, Dighi near here on Saturday afternoon. 

 Police identified the deceased as   (25) and Padmakar Sable from  . Joint commissioner of police Ravindra Kadam told TOI, “Prima facie investigations revealed that the man had stabbed the woman to death with a knife. He then committed suicide. The blood-stained knife was recovered from the spot.”
 
 Bale, who used to stay in Hadapsar, and Sable were childhood friends. Dighi police station in-charge   said Sable, who was also married, had come to meet Bale and asked her four-year-old daughter to play outside. He then locked the door and assaulted her fatally. 
 
 On hearing a noise from inside, Gogare said, the woman’s daugther started crying and banging the door. This alerted her neighbours, who too started knocking the door. They decided to break open the door after not getting any response.
 
 “The neighbours were shocked to see both of them lying inside, profusely bleeding. They rushed Bale and Sable to the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital in Pimpri. While Sable was pronounced dead by the doctors on arrival, while Bale succumbed to her injuries,” the officer said.
 
 “The motive behind the crime is not known. We suspect that Sable was having an extra-marital relation with her,” the officer added.
