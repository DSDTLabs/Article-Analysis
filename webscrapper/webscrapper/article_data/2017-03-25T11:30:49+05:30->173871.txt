Indore: Facing problems in allotting the remaining 18 liquor shops at a 15 per cent hike on their rates, the state government has decided to call e-tenders on the current year’s price.

 “Following a very poor response from contractors, the state government has decided to allot the remaining liquor shops at the current year’s price. We have re-invited e-tenders at the new reduced rate,” assistant excise officer Dr   told TOI.
 
 The e-tenders will be opened on March 28 and officials are hopeful to allot maximum, if not all, shops in this fifth attempt.
 
 Earlier, the total price reserved for the remaining six groups of liquor shops, including MIG, GPO, Sanwer, Kshipra, Gawali Palasia and Tillorkhurd, was around Rs 66 crore. As per the new rates, the revenue from allotting licences to 18 liquor shops is expected to fall by Rs 10 crore.
 
 While making the excise policy for 2017-18, the state government had imposed a 15 per cent hike at the current year’s price reserved for allotting country-made and Indian-made foreign liquor shops across the state.
 
 As the department failed to attract contractors to apply at the increased license fee, it reduced the price by 5 per cent on three different rates, bringing down the price reserved for 2017-18 to the current year’s pricing.
 
 Official sources claimed that if any shop are remaining to be allotted on March 28, the authority is expected to allot the shops at less than the current year’s price.
