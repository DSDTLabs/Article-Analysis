Vadodara: A 45-year-old man was murdered allegedly by his nephew in Pavi Jetpur town of Chhota Udepur on Sunday evening over ancestral property dispute. The accused Shailesh Tadvi was arrested on Monday.

 Police said that Shailesh and his uncle Sukabhai Tadvi were embroiled in a dispute over their ancestral land since quite some time. Around two months back the duo had heated arguments over the same issue. On Sunday, enraged over the same issue, Shailesh went to his uncle’s house and called him outside.
 
 A police official said that the duo again had arguments after which Shailesh hit his uncle with his axe multiple times on his hands and head. According to police, when Sukabhai’s son Rahul reached there after learning about the attack, Shailesh tried to attack him as well.
 
 However, Rahul managed to flee from there and went to his aunt’s house. Later, on his aunt’s insistence Rahul informed the police and went to his house along with the cops. By then, Sukabhai had succumbed to his injuries. Eye-witnesses told the police that after chasing Rahul away, Shailesh again hit Sukabhai with his axe.
 
 VN Tadvi, police sub-inspector, Pavi Jetpur police station, said that Shailesh admitted that he had gone to his uncle’s house with the intention to kill him.
