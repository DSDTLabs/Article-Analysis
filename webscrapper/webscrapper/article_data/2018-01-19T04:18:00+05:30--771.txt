Vadodara: The Vadodara branch of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) registered a decline in the results of CA final exam which were held in November last year. The results of common proficiency test (CPT) – the entrance test of CA also dipped.

 Out of 378 students who appeared for both the groups in CA final exam, only five students managed to clear, which is a decline of 5.92% when compared to the result of exam taken in May last year. The Group I of CA final saw some improvement as 82 students out of total 286 students cleared, which is around 15.9 % higher compared to May. However, the Group II also saw a decline as 55 students clearing it out of total 393 students giving 13.99% result, lower than 19.08% in May.
 
 In CPT exam, where 455 students appeared, 35.16% or 160 cleared, lower compared to the previous attempt in June last year when 43.26% had passed.
 
 Rizwana Garasiya, daughter of an industrial labourer working in Makarpura GIDC, cleared the CPT with flying colours in her first attempt despite economic hurdles. “There were problems due to financial condition of our family, but I could get better coaching as my fees were almost waived off by my coaching sir,” said Garasiya, who lives with her parents and three siblings at Memon Colony on Ajwa Road.
