GURUGRAM: Call it negligence or ignorance on the part of Huda, but the lives of commuters near   Metro station lie at risk. Commuters claim a broken   near the Metro station adds to the already chaotic   in the area, as bikers and pedestrians use the route as a short-cut. They claim pedestrians, especially children, cross the road using this shortcut, enhancing the chance of accidents.

 “The divider was broken in December last year, but authorities had then fixed it,” said  , a resident of Sohna who uses this road regularly. “But now, miscreants have snapped the barrier at a nearby spot, breaking down the iron grille. It has been over a month, but authorities seem to be least interested in mending it,” alleged Maini.
 
 Arvind, a resident of Sector 56, claimed that with the spot being close to Fortis Hospital, it is always abuzz with people. “People trickle in and out of the hospital and often, in a rush to board the Metro or buy medicines, they cross the road through this broken grill, instead of walking a few hundred metres and using the zebra crossing,” he said. When contacted, Huda officials said they weren’t aware of the problem but assured it would be fixed right away. “Once we get the exact location, we will immediately get it fixed,” said Sanjiv Singla, a Huda official.
