BAREILLY: For the first time in Bareilly, students of 10 primary and   have come out with their monthly newspapers. 

 Named as 'Leher', 'Bal Utsah', 'Muskan', 'Udaan', 'Vidyalaya Express' and 'Bal Chetna', these newspapers provide a platform to students from Classes I to VIII to showcase their writing skills by contributing stories, poems, essays etc. The basic education department has decided to inaugurate their newspapers formally by end of this month.
 
 Students enrolled in primary and upper primary schools in Izzatnagar, Kohrapeer, Baljati, Mathurapur and   have collectively come out with six monthly newspapers, which are not printed in press, but students write in their own handwritings and draw images. "After the first newspaper appeared in October last, there is a craze among students to get their articles published in newspapers. The panel of editors, which has been flooded with poems, stories, jokes, essays and craft samples, decides which stories will make it to page one or will be dropped," said  , a teacher. Each panel of editors comprises 10 teachers and five students. Another teacher Ruksana Begum said, "We have decided to start monthly newspapers to inculcate reading habit among students. Now, students read textbooks, newspapers and magazines for making contributions to newspapers. Besides, students whose articles are not published work hard to make it to the next edition."
 
 Assistant block resource coordinator ( ) Anil Chaubey said, "All issues brought out since October would be inaugurated in the presence of senior officials of the department.."
