With junior college teachers going on strike during that period, the meetings of chief moderators who decide the model answers took place last week and it was decided to recommend seven bonus marks for the impending errors.

 Students will get bonus marks here. In question 6 (4), a chemical equation asked was out-of-syllabus for which students will be given two bonus marks and in question 8 (b), the equation of isocyanide was asked in a wrong pattern for which one bonus mark will be awarded.
 
 Anil Deshmukh, general secretary of the Maharashtra Federation of Junior College teachers' Organisation said, the moderators for the subject have recommended a total of seven bonus marks for four questions with misprints. These are minor misprints but it has changed the entire meaning of the questions hence students would get the benefit.”
 
 Deshmukh said that students who would have attempted the question would be awarded the bonus marks. Even those who have just written the question on the answer sheet and left it blank also stand a chance to get the bonus marks as per marking rules.
 
 When contacted, state board secretary Krishnakumar Patil said, “We are yet to receive a recommendation from the moderators regarding the bonus marks. But, if the moderators have indeed felt there were errors and students deserve the bonus we will accept the recommendation and award the marks.”
