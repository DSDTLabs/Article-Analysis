JAIPUR: The thriving tiger population at Rajasthan’s   is now the highest in the park’s history at 67, RTR officials said. The numbers are becoming more than what the park can handle, leading to tigers straying out into nearby areas. 

 Officials said there are now 21 male tigers, 20 females and 26 cubs in the reserve. With such high big cat numbers, the park is becoming a nursery for tigers populating other forests in the state. 
 
 On Wednesday, three tigers (T-72, 80 and 92) strayed out into the neighbouring   forests. Among them one was a female and two males. The number of Ranthambhore tigers that have strayed into   is not exactly known. 
 
 Apart from the ones that are dispersing out naturally, three of the park’s tigers to be translocated to Mukundara forests in Kota district. Besides that, NTCA’s permission to translocate one more tiger to   Tiger Reserve (STR) is long pending. 
 
 When STR became the first protected sanctuary to lose all its tigers to poaching in 2005, RTR tigers had re-populated the reserve. In all, eight tigers from Ranthambore were taken to Sariska under the reintroduction plan between 2008 and 2013.
