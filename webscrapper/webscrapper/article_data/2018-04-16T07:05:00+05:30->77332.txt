Ludhiana: For the implementation of 100%  , the civic officials are planning to visit Indore, the city having the tag of the cleanest city of the country. The MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh had visited Indore recently for a seminar in which officials from various cities participated and now officials from the concerned branch will visit the city for taking tips. Last year too a trip to Indore was planned but it was drope at the last moment.

 Indore has implemented the segregation of waste at the source completely in the city and the door-to- door garbage waste collection project is also going on smoothly. These two factors had worked for the MC Indore. The MC Ludhiana lacks on both fronts. And this is the reason the officials want to learn the strategy followed by the Indore officials. As per officials, Indore is generating around 1100 tons of garbage which is similar to Ludhiana. 
 
 At the moment the department is trying to educate the general public about segregation of waste even before they hand over the garbage to the collectors. Teams of MC officials are visiting houses in many areas with pamphlets and other material asking people to segregate the dry and wet waste in two different coloured dustbins. Similarly the door to door garbage collection could not be achieved despite several attempts. In the past over seven years only 35 percent of the city has been covered under door to door garbage collection. 
 
 Jaskiran Singh said, “We will send a team of best officials to Indore to learn the lessons with which it was declared the cleanest city last year.” He said they wanted to organise this trip as soon as possible but due to some ongoing events in Indore they would have to wait for some days but they will send the officials after taking appointment from them.
