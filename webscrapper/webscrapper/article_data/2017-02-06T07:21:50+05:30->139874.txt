CHARMINAR: Taking strong exception to the removal of   commemoration pole at Charminar, Congress party workers on Sunday demanded that TRS party leaders apologize and act against the guilty. The   chairman G Niranjan said that removal of the commemoration pole deeply hurt Congress' sentiments.

  Last night, a mushairah programme was organized at Charminar, which was attended by TRS deputy CM Mahmood Ali, Nizamabad MP Kavita and other leaders. Niranjan alleged that the organizers along with the officials removed the pole in order to erect a vast stage. “Our beloved leader late Rajiv Gandhi had hoisted the Congress party flag and commenced the Sadbhavna Yatra at Charminar on October 19, 1990.Later Dr M Chenna Reddy in his capacity as a chief minister personally visited the place and supervised the erection of Sadbhavna pole. We have been maintaining this pole as a symbol of sadbhavna for the last 27 years,'' said G Niranjan.
 
  Other senior Congress leaders M Shashi Reddy and P Sudhakar Reedy speaking to TOI said that the act sparked anger against TRS. “We strongly condemn the removal of the pole. We have filed a police complaint against people who removed it. TRS should apologize. This act should not be repeated,'' M Shashidhar Reddy said.
 
 “Sadbhavna lovers are deeply hurt by this act. Those responsible should be booked. Strong action should be initiated against them,'' P Sudhakar Reddy urged.
 
 The Mushaira programme was organized by the Telangana Jagruti on the occasion of Maqdoom Mohiuddin's birth anniversary, a famous Urdu Poet.
