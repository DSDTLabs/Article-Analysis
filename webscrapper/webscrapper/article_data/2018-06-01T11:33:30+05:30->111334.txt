CHANDIGARH: Getting   to use increased Minimum Support Price (MSP) to dispose of paddy and wheat straw is the most effective way of stopping them from burning paddy stubble, said   chairman Kahan Singh  . 

 Addressing a daylong seminar on prevention of   in Chandigarh on Thursday, he said companies could help implement this strategy under CSR by helping farmers buy the machinery required. He cited the example of   district, where a company has installed a machine for mechanical disposal of paddy straw. 
 
 Pannu said this would be a win-win situation for everyone as pollution levels will be checked and farmers will benefit economically. He said owners of combine harvesters in the state have been informed that no combine harvester will be allowed to operate in the state in the forthcoming paddy harvesting season and then on without the super straw management system. This system is helpful in chopping and widely dispersing paddy straw and has been made mandatory under the Air Act, 1986, he said. 
 
 Additional chief secretary, department of agriculture, Punjab Viswajeet Khanna said the CM has raised the issue of crop residue burning with the Prime Minister, finance minister and ministries concerned.
