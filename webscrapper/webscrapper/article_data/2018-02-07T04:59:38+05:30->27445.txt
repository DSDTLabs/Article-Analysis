THANE: The local fish and meat markets in the city that are set up in unhygenic conditions can lead to indigestion, said medical experts.

 The doctors also believe that citizens could suffer water-borne diseases, allergies and respiratory ailments if the fish and meat stored in these markets are not cleaned or cooked well. “If flies sit on these products or if dirty water is used to clean the meat or splashed on the fish, then the person consuming the products without cleaning them well may suffer from typhoid, jaundice, diarrhea, etc. Also, if there is contaminated water around the area, then it is a good breeding spot for mosquitoes causing malaria to customers visiting the market to buy these products. Those allergic to cat or dog hair can have a problem or get asthma if their hair is present in the food items,” said Dr  , a Mumbai-based general physician. 
 
 It is even seen that immunocompromised people could get severe   problems if unhygienic fish or meat is consumed. “If patients who are diabetic or are under dialysis consume contaminated food items, them they could suffer from severe dehydration and multi-organ failure. Also, unhygienic conditions at fish and meat market invite infections that involve respiratory problems by inhaling spores of bacteria, viruses and gut infection,” said Dr Sachin Wani, gastrointestinal surgeon at Currae hospital.
 
 If the food remains uncooked, then it can lead to gastro or worm infestation, especially in children,” said Dr Anand Bedekar, a paediatrician.
