Mumbai: Opposing former state chief minister Ashok Chavan’s petition in   to challenge the governor’s sanction for prosecuting him in the Adarsh case, the state said if it is allowed it would mean a straight acquittal for him. It would then render the entire probe “futile’’, said additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for the state and the   (CBI) on Wednesday.

 When Singh and another CBI lawyer H S Venegaonkar sought to refute Chavan’s allegation of political vendetta or pressure, a bench of Justices Ranjit More and Sadhana Jadhav observed during the hearing: “As of now we believe the office of the governor is independent.” The Congress leader’s petition has alleged the BJP-led   had sought reopening of the sanction without any fresh details against him.
 
 Governor Vidyasagar Rao had, in April 2016, given sanction to prosecute Chavan for   in the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society case. The previous governor had refused sanction to prosecute him.
 
 The issue before the high court is the validity of the reversal and whether there were any new facts or details brought by the CBI. Chavan’s counsel Amit Desai had cited several Supreme Court judgments which bar review of an earlier refusal on the grounds that it would stall conclusion to the question of whether or not to prosecute a public servant each time a government changes.
 
 Since he was a public servant when the alleged offence of criminal conspiracy in the Adarsh case took place, the law required prior sanction from the government to prosecute him.
 
 The CBI case is that a high court order that contains certain observations against Chavan and parts of a two member panel report does constitute fresh “relevant” details.
