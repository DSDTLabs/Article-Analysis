  : Two of the three youths-   and Mohammad Anwar Hussain- arrested on Saturday for suspected terror links were forwarded to judicial custody, while the third, Md  , has been released on a personal bond. All three are residents of Maroofganj locality of the town. The two were produced before the court of chief judicial magistrate  , who forwarded them to judicial custody for two weeks. During investigation, no incriminating evidence came against Shaad. However, he may be called for further questioning, said police. 

 Sources said evidence of money remittance to a Srinagar-based recipient through several transactions have strengthened the doubts about the involvement of the youth in suspicious activities. Though the amount remitted was not very significant but transactions are questionable. Cops are trying to ascertain the end use of the remitted money. Raids are on to nab the absconders. TNN
