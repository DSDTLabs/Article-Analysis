PANAJI: The mercury that had been steady at   for a few days, on Friday dropped below 18C, the third time this season, as north-easterly wind started blowing more sharply. The morning chill was slightly discomfiting for locals. 

 The state occasionally experiences a mild winter nip during the months of November, December and January, and Friday saw the meteorological centre recording a minimum temperature of 17.9C. “This was the coldest day in January so far. Earlier, the minimum temperature had dropped to the lowest of 17.6C on December 24, 2016,” director, meteorological centre, Altinho, M L Sahu said. The minimum temperature had dropped to 17.8C during the second week of December. 
 
 , a few days before cyclone Vardah was to mildly impact Goa. Later, on  , it dropped to the lowest of the season.
 
 But, if citizens had any expectation that the temperature may drop lower, the wind pattern does not suggest it. Models showing wind direction pattern have not supported chilly weather for a few days.
 
 “We don’t expect the minimum temperature to drop much further and it is likely to be between 18C and 19C,” Sahu said.
 
 The days have been hotter during the last few days. The met centre recorded maximum temperature above 34C. But, this has come down to a degree below normal, to 33.3C, during the last two days.
