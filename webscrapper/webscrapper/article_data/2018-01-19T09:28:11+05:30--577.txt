JAIPUR: The   (JSS) has held the chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s government responsible for the   order lifting the ban on the release of controversial film ‘Padmaavat’ on Thursday. The JSS accused the government of not representing the opinions of people in the state in the court. They have decided to file a petition in the Apex court presenting all facts seeking ‘dabba’ (total) ban on the film. The film is slated for release on January 25.

 “The JSS respects the judiciary of our country. The court’s decision is always based on facts presented before the honourable judges. We have learnt that the Rajasthan government’s legal team has failed to do so,” said Kan Singh Suwawa of JSS. The body has said that those responsible for the debacle in the court would face the ire of the community.
 
 Soon after the decision became public around noon, the JSS, which has been in the forefront of protests in Chittorgarh, swung into action. The lawyers’ team of JSS briefed its core members to be cautious of making sweeping statements and inviting contempt of court. The body has planned a series of events till the release of the film. A national seminar on Rani Padmini is being organized on January 21 in Chittorgarh along with various forms of protests which have not been disclosed.
 
 JSS has maintained that they would contest the ban in SC as a natural party in the case as they were the descendants of those who struggled against the invaders. “The members will plan its strategy in the next two days,” said Suwawa.
 
 Reacting to the media reports that the Art of Living guru   had cleared the movie after the director screened the film for him, JSS said that they would only consider the approval of the royal family of Udaipur. “Respected Shri Shri Ravi Shankarji must understand that Rani Padmini is like Sita Mata for Rajputs. So, how will a community which has made so many sacrifices for the country tolerate any form of disrespect to their ancestors,” asked Suwawa.
