MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Tuesday asked Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to state whether municipal chief   met   at his official residence. 

 It sought TMC’s response after Patil claimed   had called him to his bungalow on December 19 and threatened him. “Will you make a statement tomorrow? If you are right, we’ll come down heavily on him. If you are wrong, it will become a serious issue,” said a bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Riyaz Chagla. 
 
 Patil had filed a petition alleging shoddy road concretization work. Patil’s name is on the list of activists who misused information sought under RTI to harass citizens, especially builders, that has been submitted to the police commissioner. 
 
 Patil’s advocate Shriram Kulkarni said the visit may be confirmed by CCTV footage and mobile tower location and his client is even ready to undergo a narcoanalysis test. “The whole issue cropped up because he sought information of transfer of development rights. Now, the municipal commissioner has given a list to the police commissioner. Let there be an inquiry in this respect,” said Kulkarni.
 
 TMC advocate Narayan Bubna denied Jaiswal met Patil. “Why should a 12th pass say in what manner an inquiry should be done?” he asked. Senior advocate Ram Apte, also representing TMC, reiterated that Jaiswal has not met Patil. But the judges cautioned. “Are you instructed to make a statement? We have to record in the order,” said Justice Oka. The bench has indicated that it proposes to direct the HC’s registry to hold an inquiry in this matter.
