Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai police is probing the role of some officials from the property registration office in the case of builder   allegedly forging documents to grab two prime plots, one in Bandra and another in Malad.

 
 
  
 
 Bhojwani, who in the past was booked for trying to grab actor Dilip Kumar’s property in Bandra, was arrested on Thursday for using forged documents to claim rights over the two huge pieces of land that belong to the Mulraj   trust. The Bandra plot is located next to the veteran actor’s bungalow. Bhojwani was produced before metropolitan magistrate   and remanded in police custody till May 6.
 
 According to investigating officer Sachin Rane, Divyakant Khatau, a member of the trust, lodged a complaint against Bhojwani, for trying to take ownership of the plots. Divyakant said the plots could be worth Rs 250-300 crore. Police said that Bhojwani in collusion with Divykant’s relatives Hiten Khatau, Dilip Khatau and Mahendra Khatau— the trio are brothers and trustees—fraudulently transferred the properties belonging to the family of one Chandrakant Khatau. Police said that Bhojwani played a key role in forging the trust’s documents on stamp papers dated 1986, imitated signatures of the Khatau brothers and got them registered in 1994.
 
 Clear discrepancies have emerged between the government records pertaining to the two plots and the papers recovered from Bhojwani’s home. The stamp papers pthat resent Bhojwani as the owner of the plots were executed in 1994, but apparently registered only in 2002, which investigators found strange.
 
 “We believe that this has been possible only with the help of some officials from the government office. We have got Bhojwani’s custody and we are questioning him about his associates,” said another officer. Bhojwani was granted bail in the cheating case registered against him for allegedly trying to use forged documents to grab actor-couple   and Saira Banu’s bungalow.
