Coimbatore: An   should be brought into the   to exempt industries with less than Rs 20lakh turnover from filing tax, industrialists who attended a grievance redressal meeting organised by the   District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia) here on Friday, demanded.

 Codissia had invited tax department officials from the GST Bhavan here to participate in the grievance redressal programme, as many industrialists had complained of issues with filing the returns for the first time. “The officials addressed specific grievances that were scrutinised by a group of 13 volunteers from the PSG Institute of Management,” president of Codissia V Sundaram told TOI.
 
 The four-hour-long exercise saw the officials attending to nearly 100 petitions. “Some of them were cleared on the spot, while some were reserved for more clarity,” Sundaram said.
 
 The most important and frequently cited complaint was the difficulty faced by industrialists who have already registered under the previous tax regime to claim exemption. “Until the GST implementation, industries with Rs 10lakh or more revenue had to pay service tax and thus were registered under the tax regime. Now, the GST limit has been raised to Rs 20lakh,” Sundaram said. “We have requested the officials of the tax department to seek an amendment in the Act,” he added.
 
 Industrialists also placed requests seeking clarity on the compensation scheme as industries are lingering between the question whether to utilise the scheme and halt job work or carry out job work and pay 18% GST. 
 
 A few days ago, Sundaram had met former minister for commerce Nirmala Sitharaman with the grievances. The minister, according to Sundaram, had promised to attend to the problems. But soon, she was made the country’s first independent woman defence minister.
