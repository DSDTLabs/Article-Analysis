Nagpur: The state government has allowed to spend Rs 25 lakh from MLAs’ fund for planting 13 crore trees during monsoon under the ‘Green Maharashtra’ drive.

 While reviewing plantation preparedness of all divisions, collectorates, and zilla parishads in the state, forest and finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, “Under the new scheme, 5% of the DPDC funds will now be spent for plantations. The collectors have been asked to make waste land available for the flagship project,” said Mungantiwar.
 
 For proper planning of saplings, the minister has directed to hold gram sabha meetings in all the districts on May 1.
 
 Mungantiwar said to tackle climate change, the United Nations has decided to plant 100 crore trees every year. “The state alone has planted 8 crore saplings in the last two years. It has proposed to plant 13 crore this year and 33 crore next year. Maharashtra will be the first state to plant record saplings,” he said.
 
 Officials have been asked to upload information about pits and saplings on the forest department’s website. 
 
 In another development, the government will implement ‘Ranmala’ village plantation pattern of Khed taluka in Pune where trees are planted to celebrate birth of a child, gifting saplings to wedding couples auspicious occasions.
