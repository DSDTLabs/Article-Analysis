The Economic Review-2016 states that though land scarcity has affected industries, Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (KINFRA) has managed to allot land for 634 industrial units so far, facilitating an investment of Rs 1,581 crore. The report says though the number of loss making state public sector undertakings increased, the cumulative loss has come down.

 
 
 
 Of the 122 PSUs in Kerala, 107 are working while 15 are non-working. Among the working PSUs, 50 are in the manufacturing sector, 16 in infrastructure, 18 in finance, three in power, 16 in agriculture and allied enterprises while 19 are in the service sector. All the 15 non-working PSUs are in the manufacturing sector. Land scarcity and high price of land, delays in obtaining clearances and environmental problems have affected the manufacturing sector.
 
 Among the 107 working PSUs in the state, 50 companies made profit and 53 incurred losses. Four PSUs neither incurred loss nor profit. Under the state industries department, there are 43 PSUs and among them 10 reported profit in 2015-16 as against 13 in 2014-15.Major profit making PSUs in 2015-16 were   (Rs 38.75 crore),   (Rs 34.55 crore) and Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited (Rs 21.16 crore). Though the number of loss making PSUs in state increased from 30 in 2014-15 to 33 in 2015-16, the total loss made by them decreased from Rs 241.23 crore to Rs 208.12 crore during the period. Major loss-making state PSUs during 2015-16 include   (Rs 29.5 crore) and Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (Rs 25.15 crore). In 2015-16, the combined net loss incurred by 43 state PSUs amounted to Rs 109.80 crore.
 
 Erosion of working capital, lack of technology up-gradation, limited product diversification, inability to cope up with changing market demands, increase in cost of production, competition and mounting financial liabilities are cited as the reasons for the loss.It calls for time-bound action for drastic changes in the sector to improve state PSUs.
