CHENNAI: Acquiring the final 500 metres of the Velachery-St Thomas Mount extension of the Mass Rapid Transit System ( ), that would have provided thousands of commuters a link to suburban services and metro rail trains, has been stuck for more than three years because the state government is willing to give less than one-third of the market value to owners of plots identified for the project. This is despite Southern Railway indicating it is ready to pay the higher amount for the 6,050sqm required. This was one of the issues Southern Railway officials raised with chief secretary   at a meeting on Wednesday. While it will take 18 months to complete the stretch after the acquisition, the project cost continues to mount due to the delay, say railway sources.

 Around 40 residents, involved in litigation over the land, say that as per the land value on January 1, 2014, they are supposed to get Rs 6,000 per sq ft. But, the government, despite an high court order, said it would pay just Rs 2,200 per sq ft and further reduced this to Rs 1,912 per sq ft.
 
 The project when completed will link  , planned as a nodal point for suburban network,   and the MRTS, and is is eagerly awaited by residents.
 
 Another issue faced by owners of the land identified for the projects is that as wait for settlement of the issue, the value of land in nearby areas has shot up.
 
  “We cannot buy land nearby. The rent values have also gone up. The government is responsible for the delay,” said B Vishwanathan, one of the 40 residents fighting a case with the government.
 
 Sources in the state government say that if the price demanded by owners of plots along the last 500 metres of the line is acceded to, those who had given their land for construction of the 4.5km acquired earlier would demand a higher compensation.
 
  “It will set a benchmark for other land acquisition projects,” sources said.
