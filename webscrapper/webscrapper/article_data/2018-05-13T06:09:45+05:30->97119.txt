GUWAHATI: Once a BJP candidate from Lahowal in   and the only private individual to mediate between militant outfit   and the government since 1990,   has been missing for three weeks now. His disappearance comes at a time when he was negotiating a fresh proposal for the Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa (Independent) faction with the Centre with help from NSCN (Isak-Muivah) interlocutor RN Ravi.

 
 Phukan went missing on April 22 and was last seen going for a walk, leaving behind his two cellphones at home. Chief Minister   ordered a search unit of the Assam police to take up the case, but police are still clueless about the former national football player's whereabouts. Police are focusing on the abduction angle after his son Kaushik alleged his father might have been targeted for his efforts to bring Baruah to the negotiating table.
 
 Phukan and Baruah grew up together at the Jeraigaon Chakalibhoria village in Dibrugarh district. His first initiative to bring Ulfa to the negotiating table in 1990, during Hiteswar Saikia's iron rule that broke the outfit's backbone, ended with the surrender of hundreds of cadres.
 
 Speaking to TOI from an undisclosed location, Baruah was almost certain that Phukan has been abducted. "Phukan had finished drafting a fresh peace proposal with help from RN Ravi. All that was left was taking the proposal to the PM for approval" Baruah said. "The people with whom Phukan shared this development have told me that what this new proposal had on offer was equivalent to sovereignty (Ulfa's primary demand)." This, Baruah said, makes him "certain that he has been kidnapped either by people who do not want us to engage in talks or by one of India's intelligence agencies who have interagency rivalry among them."
