JODHPUR: Though the order of the court to acquit   from the charges against him   has cheered his fans, the order has not gone down well with the wildlife activists and lovers, specially from the Bishnoi community.

 Treating it to be a case of weak arguments by the prosecution’s side, they have decided to begin a movement soon to build pressure on the government to appeal against this order in the higher court.
 
 State president of the   Vanya Evam Paryavaran Sanstha Rampal Bhawad said that the order has come as a huge blow to the wildlife activists and has discouraged their efforts to protect the poor animals.
 
 “We are not satisfied with this order and believe that the prosecution failed to argue the case in the court earnestly because of which the prosecution failed to prove the case against Khan under Arms Act,” he said.
 
 He further said that they would launch a movement on January 25 demanding appeal against this acquittal in the upper court by the state government to protect the wildlife and punish Khan.
 
 District president Ramuram Godara also said that the order has come as a pain for the wildlife lovers who have been putting in every effort to protect the innocent animals.
 
 “We are against this order as the wildlife did not get justice due to this order,” said Godara adding that Khan has already been acquitted in two cases of poaching of Chinkaras and now in one more case.
