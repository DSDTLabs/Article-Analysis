HYDERABAD: A day after attending a marriage, a couple in a relationship ended their lives in the girl's flat in   on Friday. Police ruled out any foul play and suspect it to be a suicide. However, cops are checking if families' objection to their marriage proposal played a part in the lovers resorting to the extreme step. 

  (25) and Varsha Sri (22) were found   in two different rooms in the latter's house. Saifabad police suspect they took their own lives when her family members had ventured out. They did not leave any suicide note. ACP C Venu Gopal Reddy ruled out any foul play. "It looks like a case of suicide. We are waiting for forensic findings," he said. 
 
 At around 2.30 pm, Maheshwar reached Varsha's residence. "On Thursday, the couple attended a marriage. We verified the   footage on Friday and it was clear Maheswar came to the apartment at 2.30 pm,'' a police official said.
 
 "After some time, Varsha called her brother and started crying and then hung up. He got jittery and rushed to their residence," he said. Upon reaching, he first found Maheshwar hanging from the ceiling of an unlocked room. He searched for Varsha. One of the doors was bolted from inside and when he knocked, there was no response. He then broke open the door only to find Varsha dead.
