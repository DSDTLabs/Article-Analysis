BENGALURU: A 53-year-old   was robbed of her   by two   while she was out on a walk on Museum Road.

 Ashoknagar police said the victim, Auza Rachel Panitz, who works for a multinational firm in the city and was staying at JW Marriott hotel, was walking near Ashirvadam Circle at 3.10am on April 7 when the bike-borne duo stopped next to her.
 
 The two then approached Rachel, a native of California, on the pretext of asking her directions to an address which they had on a slip of paper. In her complaint, Rachel said she had taken out her iPhone to search for the address when the two snatched her phone and fled. Police said Rachel walked to Ashoknagar police station and filed a complaint. “We have filed a case of robbery and efforts are on to trace the duo,” a police officer said.
