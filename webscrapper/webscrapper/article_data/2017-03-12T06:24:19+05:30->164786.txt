BENGALURU: Union minister   on Saturday said the 2018 assembly elections will be fought between the   and  , and ruled out space for a third party. 

 The   leader was in charge of a part of Purvanchal, the eastern end of Uttar Pradesh where the BJP scored substantially in the assembly elections.
 
 Asked what role the JD(S) would play in the Karnataka elections, Kumar told STOI: "The corners are crumbling. Look what happened to the SP and   in Uttar Pradesh." He virtually shut the JD(S) out of the 2018 bout. "People don't want to waste their ballots,'' he added.
 
 The Union minister said his role in the assembly polls is to "work side by side" with state BJP president BS Yeddyurappa. 
 
 Dismissing a suggestion that the BJP was looking for young and new faces for CMs in states, he said: "We've declared Yeddyurappa as CM candidate. He delivered pro-people programmes during his tenure as CM.''
 
 According to him, the BJP's UP performance would reverberate in the country and will be felt within the Congress too.
 
 He said UP electoral politics has seen a big change, and the state has stopped being the crucible of caste and community equations. "People have become aspirational. Since UP was one of the Bimaru states, people wanted good quality of life and governance," he added.
