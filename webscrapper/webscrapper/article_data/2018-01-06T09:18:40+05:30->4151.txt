THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Though intelligence agencies are considering multiple theories in connection with the finding of five Claymore landmines from  , a sabotage angle is not on the top of their list. 

 The state and central intelligence agencies, however, were considering the 'discovery' as serious, their opinion is that the mines were military ordinance, dumped carelessly by someone who had carried them without authorization.
 
 "This is not how the  ," an intelligence source said. "They are 19 years old."
 
 The source said the mines being almost two decades old did not mean that they were useless.   during the   explode even now, killing and maiming people. The agencies, it was learnt, were are not completely discounting the sabotage angle as the directional mines were seen downstream, a little away from the bridge across the river.
 
 "These kind of mines can be triggered using a remote control equipment, and they are highly lethal. But in this case, the mines had only explosives and no detonators," sources said.
 
 Directional mines were primarily intended to target a particular angle. Sources added that if those found were pressure mines, they would have been more lethal as any pressure exerted unknowingly by a person, animal or vehicle, could have caused a detonation.
 
 The intelligence agencies were now probing various angles parallel to the police investigation as this was the first incident of mines found discarded in the state.
 
 "Mines are exclusively used in border areas and there are lots of  . So the sabotage angle will also be looked into," sources said.
