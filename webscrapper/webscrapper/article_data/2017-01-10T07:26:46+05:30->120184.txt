PUNE: Citizens residing in unauthorised properties are set to get some solace as a government resolution issued on Monday has given civic bodies the right to calculate the tax amount for these properties.

 Currently, they are paying about two to three times the tax as penalty. It may be reduced because of this decision.
 
 According to   officials, the scheme would benefit those who have constructed more than the sanctioned plan or changed the use of their properties or have not registered their properties with the tax department.
 
 “People who are afraid of paying tax due to heavy penalty will come forward to pay now. More properties will come into the tax ambit. It will help increase the overall revenue of the civic body,” a senior official of the   department said.
 
 He said that the   had started a similar scheme in 2007 and it had been received well. 
 
 “Many fly-by-night builders have developed unauthorised properties. They have been sold to common citizens, who are now suffering due to deeds of the builders. The financial burden of paying heavy tax as fine can be reduced by this decision,” Vijay Kumbhar, founder of citizens’ group Surajya Sangharsha Samittee, said.
 
 He added that the scheme can be useful if a case-by-case study is done before making changes in the tax payment.
 
 The city has around 8.3 lakh properties, of which nearly 1 lakh are commercial and around 7 lakh residential. The city also has 29,000 open plots and the remaining 14,000 are a mix of commercial, residential and open properties. As many as 83,000 properties remain out of the civic body’s net.
