BENGALURU: A private bus was waylaid and its 42 passengers held hostage for three hours by seven men at a private parking lot in Rajarajeshwarinagar on Friday night just to recover a loan from a travel company. While four of the accused have been detained, three are on the run.

 
 Around 10pm on Friday, the bus, owned by Bengaluru-based  , left Kalasipalya for   in Kerala. Within minutes of its departure, the bus was waylaid by two bike-borne men posing as cops. The men asked the driver to deboard as they wanted to search the bus. One of them took to the wheel while the driver was forced to ride pillion with the biker.
 
 The clueless passengers, including 10 women, were driven to a private parking lot in Pattanagere. Five other men joined the duo which had waylaid the bus and locked the vehicle. For the next three hours, the passengers were held hostage until police came to their rescue and apprehended four of the seven men.
 
 Police said the miscreants were from  , which had lent money to Lama Travels. They devised such a plan in a bid to recover the loan from the travel company.
 
 “We identified the travel company owner as Rafiq. He has been asked to appear before us and give a statement. The persons detained were not directly involved in waylaying of the bus. We’re looking for three more men, including the two who stopped the bus,” he said.
 
 “As soon as they saw policemen, the men and their associates fled. We were relieved when cops took control of the situation,” the bus passengers said.
