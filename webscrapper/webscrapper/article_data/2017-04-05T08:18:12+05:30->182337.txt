MUMBAI:   failed to meet its target for the second consecutive year. With both its revenue-generating departments—development plan (DP) and assessment and collection departments—falling short of the target in 2016-17, BMC’s income is expected to be affected. 

 According to civic officials, Rs 4,845 crore was collected as property tax till March 31; the target was Rs 5,200 crore. However, the collection does not include refunds yet to be received. 
 
 A senior official from the   said usually citizens rush to pay property tax in the few days. “It happened this year too; we collected around Rs 375 crore on the last day alone. Still, we were not able to meet the target and the collection is about the same as last fiscal,” said the official, adding that through the year they cracked down on defaulters by either sealing their property or disconnecting water supply. 
 
 On March 31, TOI reported that the slack in realty market coupled with HC ban on construction on vacant plots nearly halved BMC’s revenue income from DP department in 2016-17. In 2016-17 (till February 28),   received Rs 3,366.9 crore from the DP department collected through building permissions, premiums, penalities or FSI against the estimated income of Rs 6,284.7 crore. In March, BMC revised the target revenue to Rs 3,607.1 crore.
 
 Only   has met its target for 2016-17 with Rs 7,200 crore collection till March 31; the target was Rs 6,950 crore. But BMC is set to lose this biggest source of revenue with   coming into effect from July.
