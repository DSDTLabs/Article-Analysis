NEW DELHI: BJP president   was not far behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi in replying cheekily to former cricketer   yesterday.

 Shastri tweeted the PM, Shah and the BJP congratulating them on the party's landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. He used one of his signature phrases from his cricket commentary, "tracer bullet", to describe the BJP's poll win.
 
 
  
  
 PM Modi replied right back, also using cricketing language.
 
 
  
  
 Modi's party colleague Shah was not to be left behind and he too replied, piling on cricketing metaphors.
 
 
  
  
 The Twitterati who support the BJP were thrilled with Shah's response.
 
 One praised the BJP's "wit and humour".
 
 
  
  
 
 Another was happy Shah remembered the 'karyakartas', or party workers.
 
 
 
 And yet another hoped the BJP would do even better in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
