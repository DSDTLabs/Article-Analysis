CHENNAI: An   attached to Anna Nagar police station has landed in trouble after allegedly taking a sum of Rs 36 lakh from a businessman to exchange Rs 1 crore in old currency notes for new ones.

 An internal probe has been ordered into the incident after the businessman lodged a complaint against the inspector. The inspector who was earlier in SB-CID was recently posted in Anna Nagar.
 
 After the Union government demonetised the high denomination Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November, there were attempts by people with unaccounted money to exchange such notes through middlemen and several cases of cheating were reported. The city has witnessed at least 14 such cases since November.
 
 Police sources said the businessman had approached the inspector through a common friend asking him to exchange the amount. The police officer agreed and struck a deal for a commission. He told the businessman that he had a good rapport with bank officials and could exchange the money easily.
 
 Initially, they agreed for a lower commission but after the cash was exchanged, the inspector demanded a higher cut. Though the businessman said that it was not possible for him to pay such a huge amount, the police officer did not budge and took the entire commission, the sources said.
 
 Apparently frustrated over this, the businessman lodged a complaint with senior police officers. “An internal probe has been ordered into the incident and action will be initiated based on the outcome of the inquiry,” said a senior police officer.
 
  The incident comes on the heels of another last week in which Hariharan, 45, a businessman in north Chennai, approached a gang to exchange currency notes to the tune of Rs. 70 lakh with new ones. The gang promised to exchange the notes on payment of a 40% commission. When he reached a spot in  , the gang took the money to a car under the pretext of counting the notes and fled the scene. Later, police arrested seven people.
