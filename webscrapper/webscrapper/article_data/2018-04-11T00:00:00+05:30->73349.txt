His professional career as a world-class cue sport player has him travelling across the globe more often than not, but whenever he has been in town during election season,   has made it a point to exercise his right to franchise. He has fond memories of hassle-free voting at the booth on Coles Road and is hoping to do so again for the assembly elections in May. “If we do not use our  , we fail ourselves as citizens of this country,” asserts Pankaj.

 
 
 First and foremost, we have to stop telling ourselves that irrespective of whether we vote or not, it is not going to make any difference to the state of affairs in our country. If we don’t vote, we have no right to complain. During election season, we are told to vote to ensure that we elect the right representatives to govern us. That, unfortunately, may not always be an option and you may not want to vote for any of the candidates from your constituency. Instead of abstaining from voting, you can make yourself heard by using the NOTA (None Of The Above) option. That can also send a message to the powers that be.
 
 
 
 In recent times, we have seen that our reactions are not consistent and remain issue based. We come out in large numbers when there is a problem that is affecting a certain section of people and once that comes to some end, our agitation also ends. Change and progress can be achieved only with sustained efforts and for that, we need elected representatives who consistently strive to fulfill that mandate.
