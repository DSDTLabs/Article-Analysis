GUWAHATI: The National Adi-Mishing Students' Coordination Committee and Adi Students' Union urged chief minister   to provide safety to students of the other northeasten states studying in Guwahati. 

 The organizations, representing students from Arunachal and Assam, also sought a fair investigation into the death of civil engineering student   in a   in the city recently.
 
 "The alleged murder created a sense of insecurity among students studying here. We appeal to everyone to refrain from giving a communal colour to the case," Buteng Tayeng, an official associated with both unions, said on Saturday. Leaders of the two students' bodies met Sonowal on Friday seeking justice for Dai, a resident of Arunachal.
 
 The civil engineering student was allegedly killed by one of his friends, also from Arunachal, during a drunken brawl on campus on February 20. "Police must investigate the death and restore faith of the students in the justice delivery system," Tayeng added.
