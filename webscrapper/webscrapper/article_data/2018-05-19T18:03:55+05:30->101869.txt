The city hosted its first   league on May 19 in Kadavanthra. The Kerala edition of Bubble Soccer League saw massive participation from people of all walks of life.

 Bubble Soccer is a fun format of soccer, in which players will be trying to score a goal, while wearing giant inflated, transparent bubbles. Each team will have four players. The game will last for 10 minutes, with half-time at 5 minutes.
 
 The preliminary matches took place on May 19 at Zesto Football Turf, Kadavanthra. The finals will be held on Saturday, May 26 at Maharaja Stadium.
 
 “We expect a good turn-out of participating teams for the prelims,” said   Mendez, one of the organisers. “There are four categories of teams - corporates, schools and colleges, professional clubs and women. The teams will compete against each other for sheer fun, and for various prizes.”
