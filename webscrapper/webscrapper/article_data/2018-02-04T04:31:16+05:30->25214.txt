MUMBAI: City restaurants that are still using monsoon sheds to service patrons will face the wrath of civic officials.   will take strict action against such establishments. The move comes after a fire broke out at two restorbars — 1 Above and Mojos Bistro — at   in   on December 29 last year. One of the restobars had applied to the BMC for permission for a monsoon shed and was instead using the area to service patrons.

 Municipal commissioner   at a monthly meeting with ward officials issued instructions to take stringent action against such establishments as such monsoon sheds are one of the core reasons for the spread of fire. A ward-level official said,
 
 “Generally restaurants in the city are issued permission from May to October for monsoon sheds, but end up keeping these sheds for the rest of the year. This area is then turned by hoteliers for serving guests which is illegal. We have therefore been instructed to take action against all such eateries from next week.”
 
 Henceforth, permission for monsoon sheds will also be issued up to 1 metre height from the ground level. The BMC would also check eateries using wooden staircases less that 1.5 metres in width. “Often these staircases are illegally created to provide access to hotels without permission on the rooftop and therefore action will be taken against such eateries.
