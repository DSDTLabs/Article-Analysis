After a spree of dinners post wedding, the only compliment I got was ‘hey, looking well fed!’ or ‘bursting with joy or what?’ The compliments soon became comments and the waistline not so desirable. It was time to shape up. Going back to the gym was about spending endless sessions getting the posture and technique right. I did sweat it out but always returned tired and breathless. Every   was a huff and puff affair. I wasn't breathing right. 

 
 
 Even the leanest people sometimes can have no stamina or strength while working out. The culprit in many cases is a flawed breathing pattern. Why the workout was taking a toll on me was because I ignored the most important aspect of exercising and focused on everything else. I could neither build stamina nor push myself, and as a result, I was always ‘out of breath’. The postures all fall into place if one gets the breathing right. Depending on the activity — practising yoga, lifting weights, running or simply stretching — breath awareness and proper technique can help you maximise your workout results and reduce your chances of injury.
  
 
 
 Fitness expert Siyath Hameed says one of the most common mistakes that everyone makes is jumping on the bandwagon. Everyone wants to do hard core cardio and   without understanding breath. “Improper breathing while doing a stretch or lifting weights is a common mistake. Worse still, some even hold their breath while doing strenuous exercises,” he explains. Hameed says the body needs extra oxygen during exercise and that can only be provided by breathing well during a workout. He says the fatigue and dizziness that follow a workout session are mostly due to lack of oxygen.
 
 
 
 Let your lungs be the boss. If you need to breathe deep, heavy breaths, let it happen. A natural breathing pattern is best. Breathing and knowing when to inhale and exhale is most important to drive maximum benefit out of your workout asserts yogacharya Surakshit Goswami. Rather than complicating your exercise regimen and reading too many manuals on breathing, Goswami suggests simple tips to be kept in mind. “While walking, focus on deep breathing. This strengthens your lungs and gives the body much needed extra oxygen. For strenuous workouts, the basic rule is to inhale when doing anything against gravity and exhale while returning to original pose,” he explains. Put simply, he suggests, you should inhale while lifting weights or legs during ab exercises and insists on breathing through nose always.
 
 
 
 - The warm-up is the perfect time to refocus the priority on your breath
 - Try strength training for the respiratory muscles.
 - To breathe deeply and properly, the key is to engage your diaphragm, located just below your ribcage. You’ll know you are breathing correctly when your stomach goes out on the inhale, and in on the exhale.
 - Ditch the cigarettes, correct bad posture, and keep allergies and asthma in check.
 - Nose breathing has benefits, including increased CO2 saturation in the blood, which creates a more calming effect. With nose breathing, all five lobes of the lungs are used to breathe rather than just the upper two.
 
 - Do 5 min of deep   before getting out of bed to ensure you have enough oxygen to see you through the day.
