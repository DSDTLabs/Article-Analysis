CHENNAI: A large number of children in the state pass out of school without ever having felt the excitement of dropping a chemical on a strip of paper and watching it turn red or peering through a microscope to observe the structure of a microbe.

 A science laboratory is still something of a luxury, especially in   in the hinterland.
 
 According to a 2016 report by the   and the Delhi-based National University for Educational Administration and Planning, around 62% of schools in   do not have science labs.
 
 But some of these students may soon get access to a  . The best part? It will be a mobile lab.
 
 A proposal to this effect has been taken up by state minister for school education K Pandiarajan, who at a recent gathering announced Tamil Nadu's interest in launching such labs was inspired by the experiences of states like Karnataka and Bihar.
 
 The project, which is looking to the state government for support, aims to involve students from class VI onward, covering subjects like physics, chemistry and life sciences.
 
 Though the state's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan wing initiated a similar project, it only covered the city .D Pandurengan, a scientist who plans to take the project to schools, explains how each of the 32 districts in the state needs at least one van, which can be set up outdoors to form a makeshift lab, with housing charts, samples, plants, batteries and electrodes.
 
 Pandurengan estimates that nearly 100-150 experimental models can be stacked inside each van.Through this initiative, he says that students can view the world through a scientific lens, and cultivate interest in science subjects.
 
 “The goal is for more rural students to pursue careers in science,“ he said.
