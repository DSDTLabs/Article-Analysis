CHANDIGARH: The   government has decided to extend its online transfer policy, already implented for its schoolteachers, to eight more departments. This decision was taken during a meeting of administrative secretaries and heads of these departments, chaired by CM  , on Saturday. 

 The move to extend the policy has been taken after the state government found it had statewide acceptance among teachers. The departments where it will be extended have 500 and more-state cadre posts. These eight departments would upload draft of the online transfer policy for their respective employees on their websites by next week to invite suggestions.
 
 The CM will launch the policy on April 15. Till then, a ban has been imposed on all transfers in these departments. Directions have also been issued to additional chief secretaries and principal secretaries of these departments. The state government has also sought feedback from employees, MLAs, and MPs on the draft of the policy.
 
 Officers have been asked to send copies of the online transfer policy to all MLAs and MPs. According to the policy, an employeeâ€™s transfer will depend on his or her evaluation in the annual confidential report (ACR).
 
 Others present at the meeting included transport minister  , additional chief secretaries of jail, public works (buildings and toads) and transport departments, principal secretaries of forests, public health engineering (PHE), irrigation and water resources and rural development and panchayat departments, and director of industrial training department.
