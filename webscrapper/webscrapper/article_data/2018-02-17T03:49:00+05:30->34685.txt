Vijayawada: An arrest   has been issued against   KE Krishna Murthy’s son, KE Shyam Babu, in the murder case of YSRC leader Kangati Lakshmi Narayana Reddy, popularly known as Cherukulapadu Narayana Reddy, on Friday.

 The warrant issued by a Dhone court came after Kangati Sridevi, wife of Narayana Reddy, filed a private petition in the court raising objections over removal of Shyam Babu’s name from the list of accused. Initially, a case was booked against Shyam Babu based on the complaint given by her after the murder, but cops later dropped his name while submitting the chargesheet in the court.
 
 The Dhone court issued the   warrant against Shyam Babu, Aspari ZPTC Bojjamma, and Krishnagiri sub-inspector Naga Tulasi Prasad. Sridevi had moved the court alleging the police had intentionally dropped the names of ruling party members. Since the murder, she has maintained that Shyam Babu was behind the killing of her husband.
 
 Narayana Reddy was hacked to death on May 21, 2017 at Ramakrishnapuram in Krishnagiri mandal of Kurnool while he was returning home from a function. The perpetrators first hit his car with a tractor, hurled crude bombs, and attacked him with sickles. His supporter, Boya Sambasividu, who was also in the car, was chased and killed about 500 metres away. The car driver Ellappa managed to escape.
 
 Reddy had contested against KE Krishna Murthy in the 2014 general election on a Congress ticket, and lost. He later joined YSRC, and was made in-charge of Pattikonda constituency. He had faced charges and was acquitted in the 2008 murder case of TDP leader Kappatralla Venkatappa Naidu.
