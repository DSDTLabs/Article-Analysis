THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC president   has sought a   probe to bring out the real facts behind the attack on the actor in Kochi.
“It has to be believed that some are very concerned that the real facts behind the incident should not come out. Even the hands of the investigating officers are tied. The chief minister himself is making conflicting statements on the incident which has put the   under severe pressure,“ he said. The chief minister had to backtrack from his “no conspiracy angle“ statement after he realized that popular sentiment was against him.There is a clear cut conspiracy to wind up the case after the arrests of the people involved. This was reflected in the chief minister's statement, he said.
 
 At a time when the investigation is going through the most crucial phase, there is an attempt from several quarters to jump into conclusions.Hence, there is no hope that the present investigation will look into the conspiracy angle and nab the real people involved. Under these circumstances, there is a need for a CBI probe, said Sudheeran.
