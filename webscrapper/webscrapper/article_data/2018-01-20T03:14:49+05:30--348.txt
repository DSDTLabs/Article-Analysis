KOLHAPUR: After hearing the defence regarding the bail application on Friday of Virendrasinh Tawade, an accused in the murder of rationalist Govind Pansare, the district and sessions court will be hearing the prosecution’s arguments on Saturday. 

 Lawyer Sameer Patwardhan demanded bail for Tawade on several grounds and said that there was discrepancy in the witnesses’ statements filed in the chargesheet.
 
 Referring to witness Sanjay Sadwilkar, Patwardhan said, “The   have already booked Sadwilkar in a cheating case and it is pending in court. The special investigation team has taken statement of two persons working at Sadwilkar’s office, which are also contradictory.” He claimed that the statements of Pansare’s wife, Uma, submitted by the SIT are also contradictory. In one statement that was taken on May 2, 2015, she said that two assailants shot at Pansare and her from behind. In the second statement that she has recorded on November 9, 2016, she has asserted that two persons came in front of them from behind and shot at them. These statements are contradictory and are prepared by SIT following CBI arrest of Tawade, he said.
 
 District and sessions judge L D Bille said that he will hear the prosecution’s arguments on Saturday.
 
 The SIT has so far arrested two persons in connection with Pansare murder case and has filed the chargesheet against them. Sameer Gaikwad, the first accused in the case, has been granted conditional bail. The court had granted bail to Gaikwad after he applied for the fourth time. 
 
 Tawade was arrested on September 2, 2016.
