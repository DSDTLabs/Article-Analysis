VADODARA: She was declared dead by doctors in USA thrice in September 2006 as they could not detect malaria leading to complications. But, 26-year-old Virali Modi is now back on her feet, thanks to stem cell therapy which she underwent at Mumbai, and is now working as disability rights activist with Indian Railways.

 Modi was in city on Thursday to raise awareness about rights for disabled persons and stem cell therapy. Modi, who walks with the help of a walker now, started a campaign – ‘My train too’ – after she was manhandled by porters in 2008 when she was to travel to Delhi from Mumbai by train. She collected petitions so that railway stations can have ramps and also portable ramps so that disabled people can board trains. With her efforts and campaign, six   have become disabled friendly.
 
 Modi’s another campaign is ‘Ramp my restaurant’ under which she appeals to restaurant owners to have ramps at their premises so that physically handicapped people can visit without any problem. 
 
 “Many restaurants in Mumbai have made ramps after I started the campaign,” added Modi, who works for a travel company. She also said that she has made tour plans for physically handicapped people.
 
 In September 2006, when Modi, whose father works as a manager in a chain of hotels in the US, returned from India, she fell ill. Doctors in Pennsylvania could not realize that she was suffering from malaria. By the time the malaria was detected it was quite late and Modi slipped into   for 23 days. During those 23 days she was declared dead thrice, but every time she was resuscitated. 
 
 On her 15th birthday, when the doctors were about to remove the life support system, she got out coma but her entire body below the neck was paralysed. In 2008, her parents brought her to India after which she underwent stem cell therapy treatment at a brain and spine institute in Navi Mumbai.
