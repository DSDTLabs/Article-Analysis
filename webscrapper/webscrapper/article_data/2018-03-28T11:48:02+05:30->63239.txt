PATNA: Irate over Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary’s decision to pass the Appropriation Bill through voice vote,   MLAs on Tuesday boycotted the legislative assembly proceedings in the post-lunch session and staged a ‘dharna’ for nearly 30 minutes before the Speaker’s chamber.

 “Had the Speaker allowed a ‘head count’ as per our request, the treasury benches would have faced shortage of majority for the money bill and the coalition government might have fallen,” leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav told reporters.
 
  member and former minister Awadhesh Kumar Singh recalled former CM   had to resign after his government failed to prove majority in the House on the Appropriation Bill after a head count.
 
 However, Choudhary refuted the charge, saying the proceedings were conducted as per Rule 56 of the Conduct of Business in   Vidhan Sabha.
 
 After the dharna, RJD, Congress and HAM (S) members held a meeting and decided to submit a petition to the governor seeking his intervention. Manjhi alleged the Speaker avoided a ‘head count’ under pressure from the state government.
