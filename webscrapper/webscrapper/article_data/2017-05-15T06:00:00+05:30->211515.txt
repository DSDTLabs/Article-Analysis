GHAZIABAD: More than 150 parents held a four-hour long symbolic strike outside the office of district magistrate, Ministhy S, on Sunday and demanded that a three-member district committee’s recent report over the   issue should be made public. The protesting parents also complained that the district administration has passed the buck to the state government over the issue.

 Navneesh Rana, one of the protesters, said the parents wanted an assurance that the schools in the district would not charge the hiked fees before the state government comes up with a decision. “The report and its findings should have been made public. We were waiting from May 11 hoping that our problems will be resolved by the administration. This has left us more confused instead,” he said.
 
 The three-member investigation panel had shared a report over the fee hike issue with the administration on May 11 following relentless protests by parents.
 
 Meanwhile, Ministhy S, district magistrate of   told TOI that she had repeatedly reminded the parents that she had already raised the issue with   and the chief minister’s office. “If the state government is already looking into the policy loopholes, independent decisions cannot be taken in different districts. The only other way for parents is to approach the court of law,” she asserted.
 
 Seema Tyagi, one of the leading protesters, said that Sunday’s protest was only symbolic in nature and the parents are ready to expand their protest if they do not get a satisfactory response.
