BENGALURU:   chief minister HD   is likely to keep the finance portfolio, a 
  , with the latter said to be agreeable to the former’s demand, sources said on Tuesday.

 
 It appears that Kumaraswamy’s father H D Deve Gowda’s deft navigation is behind JD(S) winning the battle. Just a week ago 
  as chief minister, he had told TOI that his father would not be doing any back-seat driving.
 
 While   sources said the finance portfolio will not be a “sticking point”, the party would wait to see what other berths it gets. It was also indicated that the party did not want to prolong uncertainty over cabinet formation as it would spur speculation over a power tussle.
 
 Sources told TOI that all discussions between the two coalition partners were happening “at the top level” where it was reluctantly agreed by Congress to give the finance portfolio to JD (S), notwithstanding arguments by the former that during the 2004 and 2006 coalition governments in Karnataka, the portfolio was with the respective deputy chief ministers.
 
 “Congress was told that the situation is different from 2004 and 2006 and hence those precedents cannot be cited now,’’ they added.
 
 Congress was reminded by JD(S) over several rounds of meetings in New Delhi that it had offered unconditional support for five years when it agreed to form the government, sources said.
