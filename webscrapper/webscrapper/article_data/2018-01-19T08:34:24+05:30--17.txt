CHENNAI: More than 75,000 people were booked for traffic violations including drunk driving, riding two-wheelers without helmets and driving cars without wearing seat belts across   during the Pongal holidays, the State Traffic Planning Cell of the Tamil Nadu police department said on Thursday.

 Police said the number of violations went up by 265% when compared to traffic-related offences committed during the same period last year.

The   compiled the violations recorded on Bhogi Pongal, Pongal Day, Tiruvalluvar Day and Uzhavar Day to arrive at the figures.
 
 Police said they had stepped up checks which has led to an increase in the number of cases registered.

 Although the number of violations went up, the number of calls made to the '108' emergency ambulance service for road accidents went down during the four days. While last year 3,903 calls were made, it dropped to 3,486 this year for the same period. The number of overall calls made to the '108' service during the four-day holiday also came down by almost 30% from 93,607 in 2017 to 66,316 calls for the corresponding period in 2018.
