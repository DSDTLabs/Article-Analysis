GHAZIABAD: A 52-year-old trader was allegedly robbed of cash and belongings at gunpoint by two bike-borne miscreants at the   (RDC) flyover late on Tuesday evening.

 The victim identified as Jasbir Singh is a proprietor of a printing press in Bazariya,  .
 
 The incident took place at around 9:45 pm when Singh was on his way back home on a scooter. “When I began ascending the flyover, two men on a bike wearing helmets signalled me to stop. I did not pay heed and sped ahead. Around 50 meters ahead, they overtook me and blocked my path with the bike. The man riding pillion walked up to me, pressed a gun against my abdomen. He snatched away cash worth Rs 24,000 that was stashed inside my pocket. He also took away a gold bracelet that I was wearing,” Singh told TOI.
 
 According to Singh, before the men escaped with the plunder, they seized the ignition key of the scooter and flung it far across the flyover so that he would not be able to give them a chase.
 
 Singh lodged a complaint in this regard at the Kavi Nagar police station late on Wednesday night. An FIR was registered under section 392 (robbery) of the IPC.
 
 “The case has been registered against unidentified assailants. We are looking for CCTV footages, if any, of the flyover stretch to get details about the assailants,” said a police official.
