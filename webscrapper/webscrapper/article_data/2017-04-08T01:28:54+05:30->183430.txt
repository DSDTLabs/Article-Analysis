NEW DELHI: With the nomination of 24 of its candidates rejected, Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India plans to challenge the entire process of scrutiny of forms in court after the municipal elections.

 Calling the 40% rejection of nominations by the State Election Commission (SEC) “unprecedented”, Yadav alleged that the returning officers (ROs)rejected the forms on “frivolous grounds”.
 
 “As per law, we can’t do much right now. But we will definitely challenge this entire process in the court after the elections are over. There is systemic discrimination against smaller parties and independent candidates. As it is, the entry level barriers are very high, this kind of scrutiny makes it even more difficult for people to contest,” said Yadav.
 
 “This is a massacre, not scrutiny. 40% rejection is unprecedented. This doesn’t even happen in panchayat elections where a large number of candidates are illiterate. They have rejected maximum number of independents,” said Yadav.
 
 Pointing at the rulebook, Yadav said that the role of the RO is to facilitate filing of nominations and not reject candidates on “unsubstantial” grounds. 
 
 Swaraj India spokesperson Anupam alleged that the ROs did not even inform the candidates about the discrepancies in their forms. “The officials have to give a discrepancy slip while accepting the nomination form. But in some cases, the officials listed a discrepancy while accepting the form and while scrutinizing another discrepancy is listed,” he said.
