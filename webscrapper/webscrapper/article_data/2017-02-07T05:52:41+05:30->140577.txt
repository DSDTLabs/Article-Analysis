BENGALURU: The recent decision by the   (BBMP) to constitute a panel to review commercial activities in residential areas, has run into opposition from many   (RWAs) in the city. 

 At a meeting with city Mayor G Padmavathi last week, members of   and representatives from 17 RWAs opined that the setting up of a committee is unnecessary as the existing law is clear and prohibits commercialization of residential areas.
 
 The RWA members said the panel mooting any recommendations to regularize these will be in contempt of a 2019 Karnataka high court interim order directing the BBMP to undo the changes to the Revised Master Plan 2015 and disallow commercial activities in roads having a width of 40ft and less.
 
 The citizens requested the Mayor to instruct the civic body to not go ahead and form the committee in this matter and to implement the HC ruling. After an hour of deliberation, the Mayor assured the RWA members that she will take up the matter in council.
 
 It may be noted here that during the monthly council meeting held in January, the Mayor had announced a panel to review commercial activities in residential areas.
