NEW DELHI: Central Industrial Security Force’s ( )  , which was adjudged on Saturday the “best marching contingent” among para-military forces and other auxiliary marching contingents that participated in this year’s Republic Day parade, had undergone a gruelling practice schedule spanning nearly six hours a day.

 This is the fifth time CISF contingent has been adjudged as the best, the earlier occasions being in 2007, 2008, 2013 and 2015. 
 
 CISF director-general O P Singh congratulated the contingent for its “excellent performance and for bringing proud moments to the organisation”. He commended all officers and jawans who helped shape up the contingent so “perfectly” that it could achieve the ‘Best Marching Trophy’. 
 
 Of course, the practice schedule and preparation ahead of the R-Day honour was anything but easy. Those eligible for selection had to be strongly-built, about 6 ft tall and with an age profile between 23 and 25. This year, the force personnel of the contingent started practising in the beginning of November. Their daily practice schedule would start with rigorous physical training. The marching practice would be conducted under the supervision of select outdoor instructors from 0900 hrs to 1230 hrs in the morning and 1500 hrs to 1715 hrs in the evening. Special sessions of yoga, massage and motivation were also thrown in.
 
 The CISF contingent this year comprised 148 officers and jawans, including 3 lady sub-officers, and was led by Assistant Commandant Prabh Simran Grewal.
