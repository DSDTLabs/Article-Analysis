AHMEDABAD: Gopal Italiya, a PAAS leader, on Friday filed his affidavit before   commission probing alleged police atrocities on Patidars, and submitted that houses of Patidars were identified before the GMDC public meet in August 2015, after which large-spread violence broke out in the state.

 Italiya also alleged in his affidavit that police belonging to   community were not deployed on August 25, 2015 when   addressed a massive rally on GMDC ground in Ahmedabad. Italiya is the person who had thrown a shoe on MoS Home Pradipsinh Jadeja last year and called up deputy CM   regarding alleged illegal supply of liquor. Italiya was serving as a constable at   police station of the city during August 2015.
 
 “I am an eyewitness of police atrocities on innocent Patidars, many of whom had lost their lives. I was serving as a policeman in Madhupura police station of Ahmedabad city and considering the massive rally, a large police deployment was made at the GMDC ground, but I was not given duty at the venue of public meet. I was kept reserved in the police station. It must be investigated why the policemen from the particular community were not deployed and was that the part of any political conspiracy,” reads the affidavit.
 
 Italiya added, “Police inspector M B Khileri asked his subordinates to identify houses of Patel community as a part of conspiracy to assault Patidars who were fighting for the OBC quota. I was also asked to identify through voters’ list. This can also be part of the conspiracy against Patidars in which police was involved.”
