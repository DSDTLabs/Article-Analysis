PATNA: Rashtriya Lok Samata Party ( ) lawmaker Lalan Paswan’s Tuesday visit to the   hostel in Vaishali, where Mahadalit girl Reena Kumari was allegedly gang-raped and murdered on January 7, and his uncomfortable questions to the other girl inmates have sent out shock waves and grabbed media headlines.

 Paswan, himself a Dalit, asked the hostel inmates insensitive and humiliating questions like “which body parts or private parts of Reena was bleeding”. The RLSP has neither formally condemned Paswan nor passed any stricture against him. 
 
 “The MLA (read Paswan) should not have asked such questions. It is humiliating. He further insulted them after the gang-rape and killing of my daughter,” Kusumi, mother of Reena, said on Wednesday.
 
 AIPWA state secretary   said Paswan’s conduct reflected his “mindset” and it was for the RLSP to take a decision on him as the 345 girl students of the school had been left traumatized by his questions. 
 
 Incidentally, on January 6, Reena had talked to Kusumi over phone and asked her mother to come to the school. When Kusumi visited the school next morning, Reena told her, “A Sir wants me to do ‘galat (wrong/illicit)’ act. If I oblige, he will increase my marks,” a shocked Kusumi recalled her daughter as saying. The mother wanted to confront the teacher and the school principal, but Reena got scared and asked her to return. It proved fatal for her, Kusumi said.
 
 As AIPWA state secretary Tiwari said, a girl inmate of the same hostel had been raped and killed last year and her body could not have been traced. Besides, as Kusumi said, four years ago, a teacher had tried to molest Reena, which she had strongly resisted.
 
 “It is time for the CM to take note of the increasing instances of violence against women, specially Dalit and Mahadalit girls in the state,” Tiwari added.
