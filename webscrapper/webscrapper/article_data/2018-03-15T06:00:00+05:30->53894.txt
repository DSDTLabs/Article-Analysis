KOLKATA: Tata Motors could not do it. But just 1km away from the proposed Nano facility at  ,   (HSCL) has decided to invest Rs 1,000 crore in its   plant in Hooghly district. 

 The move is aimed at making the HSCL factory near Singur one of the largest integrated carbon complex in the world. Himadri Speciality Chemical is among the top three carbon black manufacturers in India along with Aditya Birla Nuvo and Phillips Carbon Black; the Mahistikry plant is the group’s largest.
 
 Bain Capital, the Boston-based private equity giant, is one of the strategic investors with 24.66% stake in this city-based carbon and chemical manufacturer. The HSCL board has approved over Rs 750 crore investment in the project. HSCL has a turnover of around Rs 1,500 crore.
 
 Speciality carbon black has a wide range of usage from tyre, automobile interior, wires and cables to moulded rubber goods, plastic, inks and coatings. 
 
 HSCL’s CEO Anurag Chowdhary said the expansion would be in speciality carbon black, which is globally dominated by Cabot of the US and Onion of Germany. “There is hardly any organised speciality carbon black manufacturer in India. We shall concentrate on this segment, which is now largely imported in our country,” he added.
 
 According to Chowdhary, the investment will be made over five years in two to three phases. The first phase will be completed by April 2019. He pointed out that the total capacity of the expanded unit would be 2 lakh tonne and in the first phase it will produce 60,000 tonne. The plant’s existing capacity is 1.2 lakh tonne, a majority of this being carbon black.
 
 The company now produces 15 grades of carbon black and after the proposed investment, it will produce 40 more grades of speciality carbon black. “Besides, domestic market, we shall export it to China, Japan, the UK, the US, Europe and Middle East,” Chowdhary said. Incidentally, HSCL has a plant in China along with nine plants in the country.
