BENGALURU: Even as the debate over Karnataka wanting a separate flag continues, people who supply the tricolour to the entire country and all of India’s foreign offices, are of the opinion that both the flags can coexist so long as law permits it.

 The   (KKGSS), Hubballi, which is the official maker of the national flag, producing more than 200 flags of different sizes per day, said it can make a state flag in an event such a symbol comes into existence.
 
 S S Mathapati, secretary, KKGSS, told TOI: “ There are people arguing that there cannot be a state flag while some say there’s nothing that prohibits it. So, it is important to see whether the Constitution allows a state flag.”
 
 While members of the BJP have accused the Congress-led government of using people’s sentiments for political gain, chief minister   has defended the move to form a committee to look into the legalities of the matter. 
 
 “Kuvempu, DaRaBendre,  , HaleGannada, Naada Geethe #NammaFlag have existed since ages, as part of our culture. They are Indian. Period. (sic),” irrigation minister M B Patil tweeted on Thursday, referring to poets, old Kannada, the state anthem and the flag.
 
 Constitutional expert   criticised the move which he feels is in violation of the Constitution, while BJP leaders—both national and state—have said India is one nation and that there is only one flag.
 
  “If such a flag comes into existence, we do not think it would in anyway dishonour the national flag, for which there is a lot of respect,” Mathapati said.
 
 He said the federation is ready to even produce such a flag. “There are stringent standards that must be followed while making the national flag. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification is a must. We don’t make even a single piece without the BIS mark. Now, if there’s a state flag, we must see what standards are set for that. We will then equip ourselves to those standards,” he added.
