HYDERABAD: A pregnant woman, who was part of a decoy operation, went to Jyothi Reproductive Health Care Centre, Ameerpet, on Monday and discreetly enquired whether she could know the sex of her unborn child. She was willing to pay any price. The hospital assigned two ‘aayahs’ (workers) to take care of her.

 
 The duo summoned an auto to take her to a scanning centre at  , tucked away in a residential apartment three to four kilometres away. Incidentally, they changed multiple autos en route to Sujatha Scanning Centre, Krishnanagar at Yousufguda.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 After the scan, the doctor at the centre openly announced the sex of the foetus. The two agents even offered ‘servicing’— abortion of the female foetus to the pregnant lady. The entire operation was videographed by a team, comprising police and health officials, and they caught the aayahs and the doctor red-handed while accepting money.
 
 “The two women workers also offered ‘servicing’ — a term used for facilitating abortion of a female foetus — at the hospital for Rs 28,000 (Rs 13,500 for the helpers, Rs 800 for the doctor for the test, Rs 1,500 for a middleman for ‘referring’ her to the centre and the rest for the abortion ( ),” revealed Dr  , in-charge district medical health officer (DMHO).
 
 From travelling 7-15 kilometres to a quiet residential area with a pregnant woman in tow to changing multiple vehicles en route, agents facilitating ‘illegal sex-determination’ go the extra mile to carry out the process in a secretive manner. Sometimes, the ‘service’ offer is made at one location, test at another and sex of the foetus revealed at another location.
 
 The decoy operation exposed the dark underbelly and clandestine operations of agents, hospitals and scanning centres, most of them operating from one-room tenements in residential areas.
