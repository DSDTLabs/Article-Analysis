PUNE: Police commissioner   on Tuesday suspended senior inspector of Khadki police station Suhas Bhosale after murder suspect Siraj Allauddin Amir Qureshi escaped from the lock-up on Sunday.

 Senior inspector of the anti-extortion cell of the crime branch   will replace Bhosale.
 
 The top brass of the   had already suspended two police constables who were on lock-up guard duty when Siraj and his aide Sunny Vijay Andy escaped after cutting the grille of the window. 
 
 Andy, who was brought to the Khadki police station for questioning in connection with the same murder, was detained on Monday night.
 
 A senior officer from the Pune police told TOI that Bhosale has been suspended for negligence. “He was the investigating officer in the murder case of Yogiraj Khandale. It was his duty to make proper security arrangements in the lock-up,” the officer said.
 
 Seven suspects in the Khandale murder case were in the lock-up. “Bhosale had appointed only two guards for security,” he added.
 
 Bhosale had failed to give instructions to the guards about the standard operating procedure. 
 
 “This helped the suspect to get the hacksaw blade easily which he used to cut the grille,” the officer said.
 
 The escape of a murder suspect from police lock-up is a serious issue for the discipline of the force. “Bhosale has been suspended for   of duty,” the officer added.
 
 Shukla also suspended V B Gujar, a sub-inspector attached to the Cantonment police station, after an audio clip of the latter threatening a restaurant owner on M G Road went viral on the social media. Gujar had allegedly demanded money from the restaurant owner and threatened him of forcibly shutting his restaurant if did not give it to him, the officer said.
