ITANAGAR: The All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union ( ), in a representation submitted to Union home minister   on February 20, sought the appointment of a regular governor in the state. 

 "Among the succeeding governors here, one was severely reprimanded by the   for his constitutional faux pas while the other landed himself in trouble for behaviour unbecoming of a person holding such a high post," the Aapsu said in its representation.
 
 It further asked the Centre to come up with a solution to the decades-old   issue. It said Chakma refugees in the state had started forming armed groups. "They are also actively involved in things like drug trafficking," the representation said.
