TUMAKURU/DAVANAGERE: An elderly woman reportedly died of cardiac arrest in Chitradurga's Kanchipur village following   in the district on Sunday. Tremors measuring 2.9 on the Richter scale were felt in some villages of  's Chikkanayakanahalli taluk and Chitradurga's Hosadurga and Hiriyur taluks. 

 According to the villagers, Rammakka, 72, died trying to run out of her house after the low-intensity tremors hit Kanchipur on the Hosadurga-Hiriyur border around 6.43am on Sunday. Officials, however, said they were yet to establish the exact cause of her death.
 
  The tremors cracked a few walls in Kanchipura, forcing people to come out on the streets. The roof tiles of the village's Kanchi Varadaraja Swamy temple and Panduranga Swamy temple in Hiriyur's Pilajanahalli were also damaged. "The tremors lasted 10 seconds and were recorded in nine seismometers including the Jogimatti seismometer observatory nearby Chitradurga town, said G S Srinivasa Reddy, director, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell, Bengaluru. 
 
 The tremors had no impact on the Vanivilasa Sagar dam in Hiriyur. Speculations were rife that the tremors were a result of extensive iron-ore mining in the region. Officials of the Mines and Geology department, however, clarified that the tremors shouldn't be linked with mining and that they were a natural phenomenon caused by involuntary movement of earth's surface caused by stress in the underground rocks.
