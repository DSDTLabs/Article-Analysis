HUBBALLI: Family members of  ,   of the BJP's Gadag district unit, are gearing up to welcome BJP national president   on Thursday afternoon. 

 Malashetti, a BJP worker for 14 years, had been a member of the Gadag-Betgeri City Municipal Council (GBCMC). He's a businessman involved in painting, hardware and jewellery business. He has painting agencies in Hubballi and Gadag. He has two brothers and they live together next to the Veeranarayan Temple. The family has 14 members, from Indumati, 70 years, to Shreyas, 2 years. On hearing of Shah's visit, his relatives from Bengaluru, Hubballi, Kundagol and Gajendragad have come to Malashetti's house. Around 40 members are expected to be at home during the visit.
 
 The Malashetti family is involved in various social and religious activities in Gadag. Mohan's grandfather Channappa Parappa Malashetti was a member of GBCMC for 28 years and also president at one time.
 
 Mohan said he never expected the national president of his party would come to his house. "I'm a common worker, was general secretary earlier and later organizing secretary but now general secretary again. I was surprised when the party leadership informed me about Shah's visit," he said.
 
 He said he didn't try to add his house to Shah's tour programme. "Our party leadership believes that workers are its strength. The leadership may have chosen my house to enhance confidence among workers. As my house is about 10 metres from the south entrance of the temple, they may have chosen it to save time. We have put up a pandal at home to provide shelter for workers," he added.
