Mumbai:   will launch for its rich clients an   fund that will extensively use   (AI) to select stocks for its portfolio, manage the same and also indicate exit opportunities. Although in advanced markets the use of   in the financial space is growing at a fast clip, IDFC MF’s initiative is the first of its kind in the Indian fund management space.

 According to IDFC MF CEO Vishal Kapoor, the fund —   — was launched about four months ago on a pilot basis, and the results have been encouraging. However, he added that there is a fund manager who has the discretion to override the AI-driven signals and take the final call. “It’s not a pure quant- (quantitative method) driven portfolio management offering,” Kapoor said.
 
 A research and advisory firm that works in the AI space, along with an R&D team from a reputed European university also in the same space, are advising IDFC MF on this fund. If this fund — aimed at rich investors with a minimum investment ticket size of Rs 1 crore — succeeds, IDFC MF may plan a similar scheme for   as well and take that to the industry regulator   for approval, Kapoor said.TNN
