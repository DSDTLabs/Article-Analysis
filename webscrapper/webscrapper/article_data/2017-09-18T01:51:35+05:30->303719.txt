NEW DELHI: With less than two weeks left for the director general of  , Sudhir Yadav, to retire, the   has initiated the process to appoint his successor. The order is likely within a week, said sources.

 Four officers from the AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Union territory) cadre are learnt to be under consideration for the post. Besides special   (CRPF) S N Shrivastava, three others — Ajay Kashyap, Rajesh Malik and Nithiyanandam — are from Delhi Police, an official said.
 
 Kashyap is special commissioner (traffic) and belongs to the 1985-batch. Malik, a 1986-batch officer, is serving as special commissioner (general administration) while Nithiyanandam, another 1986-batch officer, is special commissioner (provisions and logistics). Shrivastava, a 1985-batch officer, is heading the high-profile Kashmir zone.
 
 An official said the government could ignore the 1985 batch as the present DG is from that batch. If both batches are overlooked, P Kamraj (special CP, law and order & crime), a 1987-batch officer, may be considered for the post, sources said.
 
 For the appointment of DG (prisons), the home department of the Delhi government puts forth a panel of names before the lieutenant governor and the chief minister. The LG takes the final call after consulting the Union home ministry. 
 
 Last year, the home department appointed J K Sharma to the post after the then DG, Alok Verma, became the police commissioner of Delhi. However, Sharma left charge in just a day as the posting was finalised without the LG’s approval and Yadav was appointed later. 
 
 The post is considered crucial as many of the   DGs had later become Delhi Police chief. B K Gupta, Neeraj Kumar and Alok Verma were Tihar DG before their appointment as Delhi Police chief.
