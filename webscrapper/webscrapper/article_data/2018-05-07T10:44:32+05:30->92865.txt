Film celebrities  , Vidya Balan, Puneeth Rajkumar, Jisshu Sengupta and   have lent their voice to " : Priceless", a digital documentary on commercial sexual exploitation of children.

 Produced by Culture Machine, the documentary on the deep-seated and well-organised criminal industry will release on Monday in seven languages on YouTube and Facebook. It spotlights different forms of exploitation and the constant need that feeds the demand for this business.
 
 The film is narrated in four chapters -- Mol (price), Maya (illusion), Manthan (internal conflict) and Mukti (liberation).
 
 "Fundamentally, the objective is to dissuade men from buying sex from children,"  , CEO and Co-Founder, Culture Machine Media Pvt Ltd, said in a statement.
 
 "We believe that a combination of fear and stigma is what will deter men in the short-to-medium term. This can only materialise through unequivocal political commitment, proactive law enforcement and strict and swift justice.
 
 "We want to magnify awareness about this issue through 'Amoli', and consequently, mobilise the general public to demand our police, judiciary and government to address the issue. This is about stoking public compassion and inspiring individual citizens to act in whatever manner they feel comfortable."
 
 The 30-minute film is directed by acclaimed documentary filmmakers and National Award winners   and Avinash Roy, with music by Tajdar Junaid.
 
 Though shot in Hindi, dubbed-versions of "Amoli" are available in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Kannada and English. It has been strung together through stories of survivors who have been through the horrors of commercial sexual exploitation.
