It has long been some sort of 'old wives' tale' that many people have wished was not true. Unfortunately, researchers have again suggested that women find romantic partners who look like their brothers.

 In a new study, published in the Evolution and Human Behaviour Journal, participants were asked the rank the facial similarity of photos of men, who they did not know were the male partners and brothers of the women.
 
 The photos were sent in by volunteers (who might regret doing so now), other photos were of the brothers and partners of public figures and celebrities.Participants were given a sheet of paper which on one column had the brother of a woman and on the other column had four men: While three pictures were random and one was the woman's partner. The participants were then asked who the man on the first column most resembled on the second.
 
 Researchers found“clear evidence for perceptual similarity in facial photographs of a woman's partner and her brother“. If the chance that a participant would pick the woman's partner was one in four, the raw data showed people were picking the partner more than that. After all the variables were into account, the rate was around 27%. Researcher Dr Tamsin Saxton suggested “familiarity seems to be attractive“ people often choose a romantic partner with similar views.
