MUMBAI: For the first time, a   under the real estate authority   resolved six disputes on Saturday between flat buyers and builders before formal complaints were lodged with the authority.
 
 Maharashtra is the first state to establish this forum arbitrate complaints. The warring parties are given a chance to settle the dispute instead of fighting with lawyers before the housing authority.
 
 Four complaints in Mumbai and two disputes in Pune were resolved out of 16 cases heard by eight benches.
 
 The developers involved included L&T Realty,  ,  ,  . Most cases were complaints about delayed possession, buyers seeking cancelation refund.
 
 In two of the cases, developers agreed to refund the money with interest to purchasers. In a case of delayed possession, the buyer reconsidered canceling a booking when the builder said the project was 85% complete.
 
 
 “This is a promising beginning,” said state Rera chairman Gautam Chatterjee. “It will pave the way for bringing back the trust between promoters and buyers.”
