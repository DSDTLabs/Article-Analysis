LUDHIANA: The municipal corporation civic officials have served   to the owners of 11   falling on GT Road on Tuesday for failing to deposit change of land use (CLU) charges. The owners have been given 24 hours to either pay the charges or show any kind of relevant document otherwise their showrooms would be sealed. The   have been served to those showrooms where commercial activity was going on without paying the change of land charges and without permission from the municipal corporation. 

 The officials had served the notices on February 2 as well and even then the showroom owners were told to pay CLU charges because without depositing the said charges commercial activity on the premises could not be allowed. However, after almost one month when these showroom owners failed to reply the notices, the civic body officials served final notices on Tuesday. 
 
 Assistant town planner of zone C of the Ludhiana municipal corporation Kuljit Mangat confirmed the development and said, “The owners of these car showrooms have time till Wednesday and if they have any documents to prove that they had paid CLU charges then they should show the same in the MC office failing which we will be forced to seal their premises.”
