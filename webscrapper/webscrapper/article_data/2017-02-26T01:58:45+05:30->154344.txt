Navi Mumbai: Environmentalists have identified the ‘VIP   with a red beacon’ seen inside the   on Friday as   Sudhakar Sonawane’s official vehicle. They had earlier complained about the alleged damage to the mangroves due to a religious function held there.

 When TOI contacted the mayor, he confirmed that he had visited the spot. “There is an old Koli community temple there, Bamandev Mandir. I had gone there in my official car to attend a religious programme,” he said.
 
 Activist Pawan Sharma of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW) told TOI that it is disturbing to see religious function being organized inside mangroves. “We are writing to the topmost state forest authorities to inquire how a public function could take place in a restrictive CRZ area,” he added.
 
 But the mayor said that no environmental damage has been done there, as is being alleged. “As a mayor, I am concerned about our environment and will safeguard mangroves. However, there is a tar road and no mangroves were damaged,” he added.
 
 But the activists reiterated that a kuccha pathway has been widened over the last two years to allow vehicles to reach the temple.
 
 The assistant conservator of forests (ACF) Makrand Ghodke told TOI that they are inquiring about the religious programme held in   mangroves.
 
 Sharma added that they have written to the principal chief conservator of forests to find out whether the forest authorities have officially allowed the entry of vehicles inside the mangroves area.
