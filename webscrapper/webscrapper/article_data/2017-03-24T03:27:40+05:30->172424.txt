NEW DELHI: While ticket-seekers are still meeting senior   leaders in hope of getting a chance,   said that the party has finalised a   of 15 probable candidates per ward and all candidates will be less than 45 years of age. 

 The party claims that it has received 32,000 applications for 272 wards. The list of 15 probable candidates have been shortlisted by the screening committee comprising of MPs, district presidents, mandal presidents (party’s lowest unit), Delhi BJP general secretaries, core committee members and party’s MLA candidate.
 
 “We want young people to contest the municipal polls. The maximum age of candidate will be 45. This time, we will also give chance to people who are as young as 21 years of age,” said Tiwari.
 
 A final decision will be taken after March 25 rally of booth-level workers, which will be addressed by BJP chief Amit Shah. The party will announce its election committee, which will finalise the list of candidates, on March 26. “The candidate selection process will start from  ,” said Tiwari.
 
 Sources said that the party is thinking of giving tickets to three sitting councillors who had won in the bypolls last year. This is despite its decision to not give tickets to sitting councillors. “These three councillors were elected just eight months back. No decision has been taken so far,” said Tiwari.
