BENGALURU: A group of   revellers attacked two police constables who objected to them gambling in the open in Varthur, Whitefield division, on Sunday afternoon.

 Varthur police arrested four and launched a hunt for the other attackers. The arrested men — Murali Mohan, Sandeep, Kumar and   — are residents of Siddapura, near Varthur, and are aged around
 
 30. Murthy and Kumar are   workers; Sandeep is vice-president of the   Yuva Morcha in Varthur ward.

 “On seeing the cops, around 10 men rushed towards them, asking what they were doing there. The constables said they had received complaints of gambling on the school premises. But the men were in no mood to listen and charged at the cops,” a police officer said.
 
 As the attackers rained blows on them, the duo managed to escape and alert the police control room. “Soon, Varthur police rushed to the spot. By then, most of the gamblers had fled. Luckily, a youth had videographed the incident. With the help of footage, we arrested the four men,” police said.
 
 Police officers said they will question the constables, who are being treated at a hospital, as to why they visited a place which wasnot in their jurisdiction.
