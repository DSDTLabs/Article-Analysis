AHMEDABAD:   M B   of   police station has been   by the chief of city police for not acting against gambling and liquor in his jurisdiction. The state monitoring cell headed by IGP Hasmukh Patel, known for being tough on bootleggers and gamblers, raided a gambling den at   in Madhavpura area of the city and arrested 21 persons, including Husain Miyana, a listed bootlegger.

  The monitoring cell seized Rs 1.31 lakh in cash and reported to the commissioner that the den had been operating for months.
 
 One day earlier, police commissioner A K Singh had issued a circular, warning inspectors to be vigilant and clamp down on liquor and gambling. He also issued directives for police stations to register more than five prohibition cases every day.
 
 Police officials said inspector Khileri was found to be negligent in curbing gambling in his jurisdiction which amounts to serious departmental indiscipline and he has hence been suspended.
 
 “Khileri will remain suspended till the department inquiry concludes,” said a senior police official.
 
 The state government had recently promulgated an ordinance and ratified a bill making prohibition laws more stringent. “Directions were issued to cops across the state to crack down on the liquor mafia and on cops in cahoots with them,” said a top police official.
