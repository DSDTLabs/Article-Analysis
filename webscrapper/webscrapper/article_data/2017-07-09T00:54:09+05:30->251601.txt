Lucknow: Around a 300 metre stretch of   has been razed from near KD Singh Babu Stadium to facilitate   construction. Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation (LMRC) has to build an elevated ramp on this space near the stadium that would connect the underground corridor to elevated KD Singh Babu Stadium near Parivartan Crossing. 

 Since the ramp would be made on the road median of MG Marg, LMRC has to demolish the tracks on either side to facilitate widening of the road. MG Marg is a busy route connecting trans-Gomti area to Hazratganj and Cantonment. Since the traffic load is heavy, LMRC had to compensate barricading of the road-median by widening the road on the sides. 
 
 
 A senior PWD official said, “When Metro work started two years ago, PWD had given an NOC to LMRC to make whatever changes they needed to on the road to facilitate Metro construction. They needed the space to widen road on the sides so they removed it.” The official added that LMRC has also asked to demolish the cycle track near DM’s house for the same purpose.
 
 As per the NOC, LMRC will modify constructions on roads for Metro and after completing the work, it will restore the space in its original form. An LMRC spokesperson said, “Once the ramp is made, we will restore the track. It is being removed temporarily to widen the road to accommodate traffic.”
