Tirunelveli: As part of the series of protests being organised to press the Union government to form the Cauvery Management Board (CMB), members of the Thamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam locked the head post office at Sripuram in Tirunelveli Junction, on Friday. The protesters, led by party president B John Pandian tried to make their way into the office when they were stopped by the police. However, in an unexpected manner, the protesters locked the gate. Before being arrested for their act, Pandian said the Centre should constitute the CMB and stop cheating farmers and people of Tamil Nadu. He charged the government of not forming the CMB deliberately despite a clear direction from the Supreme Court. He also criticised the state government of behaving like a slave to the Centre. “The chief minister should have stepped down and fought with the affected farmers in the delta region instead of a fraudulent fast to deceive the people,” he said and threatened that the party will not allow Union government offices to function till CMB is formed. In a separate protest, members of the Naam Tamilar Katchi were arrested for trying to picket the office of the general manager of BSNL at Vannarpettai in the city.
