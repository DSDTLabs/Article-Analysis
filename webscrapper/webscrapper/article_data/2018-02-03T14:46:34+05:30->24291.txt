BHOPAL: As news of a cabinet expansion in the   government spread through the social media like wild fire on Friday, state Congress rushed to the Election Commission’s office here with an appeal to stop the same. The Congress claimed that a cabinet expansion so close to the bypolls in Kolaras and Mungaoli is a violation of the model code of conduct.

 State PCC chief Arun Yadav also shot a letter to Governor Anandiben Patel arguing that it would be against the standard of her esteemed office to permit cabinet expansion at the time of by-poll which is against the principles of the Constitution. Sources in Raj Bhavan said the swearing-in ceremony would start from 9 am on Saturday.
 
 Congress office-bearers led by Arun Yadav walked into the   office on Friday with a prayer to stop the cabinet expansion. In a memorandum to the chief electoral officer, Arun Yadav said the cabinet expansion should be stopped till completion of the bypolls. EC officials assured the Congress delegation the complaint would be forwarded to the ECI in New Delhi.
 
 In the letter to Governor Anandiben Patel, the state Congress chief wrote, “There is unofficial information over that tomorrow, you will be administering oath to new ministers. According to information received, not only have you given permission for the same, but preparations have also started in Raj Bhavan.”
 
 Arun Yadav reminded the Governor bypolls are scheduled in Kolaras and Mungaoli later this month. “Model code of conduct is in effect from the day of notification of bypolls to the day of counting and result, which is February 28. You will very well know that cabinet reshuffle expansion in some way affects people, castes and class,” the letter said. The Congress advised the Governor to keep the cabinet expansion and reshuffle away from Raj Bhawan.
