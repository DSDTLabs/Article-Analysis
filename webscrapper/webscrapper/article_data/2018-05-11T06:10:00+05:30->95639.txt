Noida: The power department has slapped a penalty of Rs 10.12 crore on Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ( ) for unauthorised supply of power to 11 shops at Botanical Garden metro station at a tariff that is higher than the subsidised rate at which it is being procured.

 Apart from getting an FIR registered in the case at Sector 39 police station, the power department has also asked DMRC for its outstanding amount of Rs 9.7 crore on account of electricity duty charges since 2009. DMRC has been given 15 days to clear all dues, including the penalty.
 
 “We have been supplying 10,000 kVA power to DMRC since September 2009 at a subsidised rate of Rs 6.50 per unit. But DMRC started supplying 515 kVA electricity at commercial rates to 11 shops at Botanical Garden metro station,” Ajay Ojha, executive engineer division 3 (urban), PVVNL, told TOI.
 
 “The power was sold by DMRC to the 11 shops through a private agency called R Cube at Rs 7.22 per unit, along with a fixed charge at Rs 319 per kVA per month, since 2010. This is unauthorised and as such the penalty of Rs 10.12 crore has been imposed on DMRC,” he added.
 
 Ojha said a deputy general manager-rank official of DMRC met power department officials on Thursday and assured the payment of Rs 10.12 crore after investigating the matter. “ MC Sharma, DGM (property development), DMRC, agreed in writing to pay the fine and sought 30 days time to probe the matter. But we have given DMRC only 15 days’ time (which ends on May 23),” he added.
 
 Officials also said that DMRC has been asked to immediately clear Rs 9.7 crore dues on account of electricity duty charges since September 2009.“Since giving power supply to DMRC for metro rail operation purposes in September 2009, DMRC has not been paying electricity duty charges, citing their agreement with Noida Authority. But we maintain that Noida Authority is not allowed to decide any rebate/exemption relating to power supply. Only UPERC can do that,” said Ojha.
 
 “Despite repeated reminders, DMRC neither replied nor paid the electricity duty of Rs 9.7 crore pending from 2009 to January 2018. We have now given recovery notice to the district magistrate for further action,” Ojha said.
 
 When contacted, Sharma said, he had given an undertaking to the power department “DMRC has an agreement with Noida Authority and based on that agreement, senior officials of DMRC will decide on the matter and revert.”
