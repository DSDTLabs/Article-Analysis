Porvorim: Even before the Congress could formally launch its campaign for the Valpoi bypolls, it has suffered a setback. Senior Congress leader Pratapsingh Rane on Friday said that he will not campaign against his son and health minister in the BJP-led coalition government, Vishwajit Rane. “Family is more important than politics,” Rane told reporters on the sidelines of the ongoing monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly. He was responding to questions whether he would join the Congress campaign against his son who switched sides to join the BJP days after getting elected on Congress ticket.  “There are many instances in India, where members of the same family have contested on different party tickets,” said Rane. In the February 4 assembly elections, Vishwajit Rane was elected from the Valpoi constituency on a Congress ticket, but later joined the BJP and was inducted into the coalition cabinet as health minister, resulting in the by-election in Valpoi. Leader of opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar said that the party respects Rane’s decision.  BJP spokesperson Michael Lobo said that the party was confident of victory by a substantial margin, irrespective of whether Pratapsingh Rane campaigns or not. “Vishwajit has a good connect with the people,” Lobo said. Poll watchers say that it was Rane Jr who was instrumental in getting the two seats of Poriem and Valpoi for the Congress in the last three elections. Sources say that he has a good rapport with the youth in the constituency. Days before he embraced the saffron party, Vishwajit held corner meetings assuring constituents that he would protect their interests.
