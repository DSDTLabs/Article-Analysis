BENGALURU: Alyia Phelps-Gardiner Krumbiegel, 55, great-granddaughter of   – the German   who transformed   into the marvel it is today – was overwhelmed on finding that her ancestor’s legacy remained enshrined in the minds of Bengalureans till this day. Alyia, who is in the city for the first time, paid a visit to the final resting place of Krumbiegel at Richmond Town. 

 Alyia, who was at the Press Club on Monday, said, “I am already in love with Bengaluru. I wanted to come here ever since I learnt about my great-grandfather’s connection with the city at a floral exhibition that was held in Germany in June last year. I want to explore this city.” Although it is her first visit to the city, Alyia, a London resident, said that she would surely visit Bengaluru again, with her children in tow.
 
 Krumbiegel served as a horticulturist and landscapist for the princely state of Mysore between 1908 and ’32. Krumbiegel’s eldest daughter Hilda is Allyia’s grandmother.
 
 Family members of the late HC  , and MH Marogowda – who essayed vital roles in the transformation of Lalbagh – accompanied Alyia to Richmond Town. In her recent Facebook post, Alyia expressed her gratitude to the family that hosted her. “I feel honoured. Mysore Sandalwood soap is amazing,” the post read.
 
 Historian S Narayanswamy, who was instrumental in facilitating Alyia’s Bengaluru visit, said, “She was very curious about the works of her ancestor. She has visited India in the past but she couldn’t come to Bengaluru. We thought it should coincide with the   at Lalbagh,” he said.
 
 Besides attending the upcoming flower show on Republic Day at Lalbagh as a special guest, Alyia will visit other places, where her ancestor has left behind indelible marks of his genius.
