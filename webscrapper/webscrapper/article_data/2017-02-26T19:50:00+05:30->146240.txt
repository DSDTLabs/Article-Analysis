Her song in the film,  , a romantic melody, was launched on Valentine's Day, and has been winning her acclaim. 'We recorded the song about a month ago. It's a passionate romantic song and I was told to sing it with a lot of intensity and longing,' says the singer and adds, 'Mani sir has shot this song in a divine manner with a lot of romance.'

 Though a Kashmiri, Shashaa says that she doesn't have any trouble with pronunciation when it comes to Tamil songs. She spills her secret, 'In order to sing in any language, you have to be a very good listener and observer. And you need to have good teachers. If I'm singing correctly, the credit for my Tamil should go to my composers, lyricists and recording engineers. I write down the lyrics in English, and ask the lyricists the pronunciation of the words. For example, an 'l' could be la, La or zha in Tamil. I watch how they pronounce, as it's very important to know where the sound is coming from.'
