LUCKNOW: Bidding goodbye to the khaki dress they have worn for five years, students of   in Uttar Pradesh will from the new session in July be seen in a new uniform comprising pink-and-white check shirt with brown collar and brown trousers for boys and similar shirt with brown skirt for girls. The bigger girls of classes VI to VIII, however, will wear red kurta, brown salwar and brown dupatta. The colour code matches somewhat the new uniform of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh—white shirt and brown trousers. 

 There are 1.78 crore children studying in 1.68 lakh government schools in UP. This includes 1.14 lakh primary schools (class I -V) and 54,000 upper primary schools (class VI-VIII). The change in uniform comes after chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi in a meeting with education officials on April 3 expressed unhappiness over the khaki dress comparing it with the uniform of homeguards. 
 
 Officials said, the bright colours will boost confidence of students and they will feel at par with those studying in private schools. “Samples of   were invited from 16 states and most of them had a shade of brown, including those of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas and   and finally, three were shortlisted,’’ said a senior education official, adding that the chief minister finalised the combination of a blend of pink, red and cocoa brown. 
 
 In 2012, when SP government came to power, the khaki uniform was introduced replacing the traditional navy blue shorts/trousers for boys and skirts/salwars paired with sky blue shirt/tunics for girls. The ruling   government felt the khaki uniform was synonymous with the poor state of affairs in government schools over the years. 
 
 But officials are concerned over low cost of uniform. According to an officer, each student is given two sets of uniform, one amounting to Rs 200. This way, the government spends Rs 400 on uniform per child. “With money allocated for one set of uniform so less, how can quality be maintained,’’ said an official.
