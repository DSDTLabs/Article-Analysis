NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH:   MPs from  , led by state unit president  , climbed on the open terrace of the   building to demand compensation for workers killed in Iraq, a bizarre move that caused a flutter on Tuesday. 

  MP Jakhar, flanked by his Lok Sabha colleagues Ravneet Bittu and Santokh Chaudhary, walked to the terrace above the porch of Parliament and stood with banners seeking financial compensation for families of those killed by IS in Mosul (Iraq).
 
 The choice of a unique spot for protest dawned on those present in the Parliament precincts when they heard slogans from the three Congress members.
 
 Jakhar said, "It was not just about Iraq. It was about Parliament not functioning because of government-orchestrated blockade."
 
 He said Parliament witnessed strange scenes on Tuesday, with the usual spot for protest- the Gandhi statue- overflowing with protesters from AIADMK to TDP. "We had no space, so we had to climb that place," Jakhar said.
 
 "The government now says the workers who died, went to Iraq illegally. Why did they go to Iraq? To look for employment because the jobs that PM   had promised have not been delivered," Jakhar claimed.
 
 Asked if he had violated the norms by climbing the Parliament terrace, the Gurdaspur MP said he looked forward to a notice from the Speaker and would prefer an open hearing.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress legislators from Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts criticised PM Narendra Modi for the "meagre" relief announced for the kin of the victims killed by the IS in Iraq.
