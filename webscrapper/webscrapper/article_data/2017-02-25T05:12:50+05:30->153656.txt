VADODARA: Feeling feverish or facing any medical emergency? You won’t have to worry about visiting the doctor and wait in queue till your turn comes. A first-of-its-kind startup is all set to change the way medical facilities are delivered in the city. Two doctors have come together to provide medical facilities at your doorstep. 

 The startup will combine health with information technology. “People these days are extremely busy either in corporate sector or their own businesses. If someone gets ill, there is little time to visit the clinic. And if minor health issues are ignored, they aggravate and eventually the medical costs go up. 
 
 So we decided to bring the doctor to the patient’s doorstep,” said Dr  , an orthopaedic surgeon, who has launched   with homeopathic doctor  . “Patients can log into our website and take an appointment with the doctor who will visit them at their home, office or other designated place. The doctor will have necessary medical equipment to treat the patient. If there is an emergency, people can call on our helpline number and the medical help will reach within 10 minutes,” Shah told TOI. The startup has already tied up with doctors from allopathy, homeopathy, Ayurvedic, dentists, radiologists, pathologists and physiotherapist. 
 
 “We will provide all the medical reports online and also keep records so that the patients can refer them in future. We are simply providing a platform between patients and doctors,” Shah said. “We were working on the idea for the last six months but the real push came after demonetization when PM   began promoting cashless economy. Once the number of patients increase, we will tie up with more doctors,” Shah added.
