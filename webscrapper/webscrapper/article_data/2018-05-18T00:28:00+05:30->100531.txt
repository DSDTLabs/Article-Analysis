Tirupur: A group of 25 students from a city college have made seed balls of native breeds, which they are planning to plant before the forthcoming monsoon season to increase green cover of the city. 

 The students, who are part of Chikkanna Government Arts College’s National Service Scheme (NSS) unit, made 5,104 seed balls on Wednesday.
 
 “As summer received good rainfall, we thought it would be the good time to sow seeds to grow trees. Besides, seed balls would be benefited during the upcoming rainy season,” said A Mohan Kumar, who is part of the group.
 
 “We chose seeds of 15 varieties of densely growing trees, including fruit bearing trees. We mixed red soil along with cow dung and inserted seed balls into the mixture. Millets were used to maintain the moisture content of the mixture,” he added. 
 
 The students, who made the seed balls in four hours, say the main job was to find potential places to sow the seed balls. “We have planned to visit a few water bodies next week and plant on their banks. Besides, a few of our college mates have adopted two villages near Tirupur as part of Swachh Bharat Summer Internship programme. It could be used effectively to sow seed balls,” said Mohan, adding that interested people could get seed balls from them to grow trees.
