Kolkata is turning out to be the `meeting' capital of the country. Apart from  , a bunch of grumbling exhibitors also met this week to discuss if it was time to go on a strike. The bone of contention is the tax rebate announced by the state government. As per the   directive, there is no clarity on who should pay the amount though it mentions that exhibitors will get a refund of the state rebate.Some of them told me that the producers, who agreed to pay from their pockets, have not shown up since making an initial promise. For the second time in a month, exhibitors have threatened to go on a strike but refrained from doing so. I hear they are planning to write to CM   soon. When nothing works, Didi's there.
