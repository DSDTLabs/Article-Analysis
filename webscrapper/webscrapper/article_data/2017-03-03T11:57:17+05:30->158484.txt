LUCKNOW: Curfew was imposed in   district on Thursday following communal clashes after a highly inflammatory video clip shot and   by two   which went viral on the social media. Two people suffered gunshot injuries in the clashes. All educational institutes in the districts have been closed till further orders by the district administration.

 With almost half the district police strength already out of station on election duty, additional police force was being rushed to the trouble-hit areas from half a dozen adjoining districts. Senior administrative and police officials had rushed to Lakhimpur to personally monitor the situation.
 
 Trouble began after two local youths allegedly shot and uploaded a video in which one of them was shown using foul language for  . The video surfaced on Wednesday evening and the matter was reported to the police. By Thursday afternoon, police rounded up the two accused, one of whom was picked up from Kanpur, and produced them before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Kheri, who remanded them in judicial custody.
 
 Reports said police decided not to take the accused to court to avoid any violent reaction from the public and instead produced the accused public before the CJM at his chamber and thereafter sent them to jail. This left the local residents agitated. Earlier in the day, a host of Hindu organisations had submitted a memorandum with the district magistrate Akash Deep demanding immediate arrest of the accused under National Security Act (NSA).
 
 However, in the evening as the news about the arrest of the two accused broke out, locals gathered at   in the heart of Kheri town, accusing the police of handling them with kid glove. As a mark of protest, the mob started forcing traders to down their shutters leading to skirmishes which later took a violent turn.
