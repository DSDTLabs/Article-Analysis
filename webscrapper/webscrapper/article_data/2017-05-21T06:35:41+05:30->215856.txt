PANAJI: Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) is investigating into claims of a fraudulent approval obtained by a property owner for a residential bungalow within the no-development zone (NDZ) at  , Betalbatim beach.

 The ground-plus one construction with a basement was allegedly built by destroying sand dunes in the 200m eco-fragile zone in Gonsua. An activist, Joao  , had alleged in a complaint before the coastal body that the property owner had illegally built a swimming pool, compound wall on three sides, a retaining wall on the western side towards the beach with a gate in the property bearing survey No. 6/1, 8/7 & 8 of Gonsua.
 
 After GCZMA issued a show cause notice dated November 25, 2016, to the owner, the holder of the power of attorney denied the charges, stating that the Goa state coastal committee on environment (GSCCE), a panel existing prior to GCZMA which was constituted in 1998, had issued permission for it.
 
 Further, he stated that it is a residential house, the swimming pool is not detrimental to coastal ecosystem, retaining wall prevents erosion and compound wall is required to stabilize the landscaping.
 
 But Pereira further alleged that in a letter dated February 27, 2017 that the illegal construction of a palatious bungalow in the garb of traditional house was fraudulent, as GSCCE had not discussed it. After GCZMA set up an inquiry committee to investigate the matter, a report has been submitted and the coastal body is examining the documents to take a final decision even as the inquiry report has not mentioned any findings of violations.
