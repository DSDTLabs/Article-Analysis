HUBBALLI: A long row of tents and shacks line the open ground at Chandana Colony. These flimsy structures have become the homes of nearly 40 families, who until recently, were the owners of houses at   - houses that were demolished in the wake of a recent court ruling. 

 Around 20 years ago, the families had purchased 20x30ft plots from Aman   paying Rs 25,000. In an unfortunate turn of events, it turned out that Sab had only been given power of attorney by  , the original owner of the property. Arjunappa's daughter Mahadevi Bandenavvar challenged the sale of the property to the families in court, and received a ruling that annulled the transaction. 
 
 After Mahadevi received an order in her favour, the houses at Chandana Colony were demolished under police supervision, and after a few hours, the residents had been rendered homeless.
 
 Banu Gosavi, one of the disaffec ted residents of Chandana Colony, said, "We are out on the streets. We are daily wage labourers. We have been forced to live in tents, and the problem worsens when it rains because water ends up entering them." 
 
 Another affected resident, Lakshman Nayak said, 'We have appealed to the   (HDMC) to provide us temporary shelter, but there has been no response to our demand. We even staged a protest in front of the HDMC office. But, the officials and the elected representatives appear not to be interested in solving our problem."
 
  Mahadevi said that her father had been cheated by Aman Sab , who had taken power of attorney illegally. "We finally got justice from the court. We have acquired the land in accordance with the court orer. We have not cheated poor people," she added. 
 
 However, the people who purchased plots from Aman Sab have not been able to reach him.
