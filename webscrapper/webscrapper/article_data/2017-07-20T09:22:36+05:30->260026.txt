PATNA: Hopes of a truce following a meeting between   chief minister  , RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and deputy CM   faded rapidly on Wednesday with members of both parties back to hurling invectives at each other.

 Shortly after trusted Lalu associate and former Bihar minister Shivanand Tiwari said the 
  , Alok told TOI, “We are neither aware nor concerned about what transpired between Nitish ji and Tejashwi on Tuesday. But, as a party, 
  on the corruption charges against him... Zero tolerance on corruption is part of our common minimum programme.”
 
 An incandescent Tiwari struck back. “Aisa lagta hai ki inhone (Nitish) BJP se deal kar liya hai. Paanch minute bhi kursi se alag nahi reh sakte (it seems he (Nitish) has struck a deal with BJP. He cannot stay away from power even for five minutes).” Tiwari further said Lalu’s family members had provided enough explanations about their wealth and it was now up to Nitish to explain to the people of Bihar whether he has had a secret arrangement with the BJP.
 
 Tiwari fumed, “Is he (Nitish) the contractor of Bihar that people should give all types of explanation to him? Why is he quiet on the talks of ‘helping hand’ being extended by BJP to him ever since the turmoil in the alliance began? The BJP says it would not allow the Nitish government to fall if RJD leaves the alliance.” 
 
 Sources said Tejashwi told Nitish during their meeting in the CM’s chamber on Tuesday that he would take legal recourse on corruption charges levelled against him in the FIR lodged by the CBI on July 5 in the ‘land-for-railway hotels’ case when Lalu was railway minister.
