CHANDIGARH: Despite dissenting note from opposition leader  , a high-powered committee headed by chief minister Amarinder Singh, on Thursday, recommended six names for the post of Punjab Public Service Commission ( ) members and two for information commissioners to the governor. 

 Those who have been recommended as official members of PPSC are serving IAS officer  , retired IPS officer Lok Nath Angra, Gurpartap Singh Mann, Jamit Kaur Teji and Prof Neelam Grewal. Techie Supreet Ghuman's name has been recommended for the post of non-official PPSC member.
 
 Names of columnist  , who had written Amarinder's biography, 'The People's Maharaja,' and Patiala resident Sanjeev Garg have been recommended for the two posts of information commissioners.
 
 Khaira objected to the names of Angra and Garg, claiming other shortlisted candidates by the search committee were better qualified. Khaira told mediapersons, "I am saddened to inform you that   has taken the majoritarian route instead of consensus to appoint six members to PPSC and 2 RTI commissioners in today's meeting."
 
 He said he had recorded his dissent against undeserving candidates but the other two members went ahead with pre-decided names. Khaira also said he would make more details public on Friday.
