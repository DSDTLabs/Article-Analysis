HYDERABAD: Almost a year after he underwent a limb-lengthening surgery, S   continues to be confined to his bed, waiting for justice. His family says that it'll take at least one more year for the young techie to get back to a normal life. 

 It was in early April, 2016 that the then 22-year-old walked into the at the city's  , hoping to walk out three inches taller. Now, his father,  , is running from pillar to post demanding action against the hospital and the doctor. The family has also filed a case with the Telangana State Consumer Dispute Redressal forum seeking a compensation of Rs 1 crore one crore from the two parties. The charges: medical negligence, deficiency of service and unethical trade practice. 
 
 "We had filed a case with the central crime station too; but there has been little progress so far," said Reddy adding, "We had also requested the director of medical education (through the police) to form a committee and inspect the issue. It's been more than two months since then and we don't know whether that committee has been formed or not."
 
 But even as Reddy appealed to the government to create awareness about the ill-effects of such surgeries, Dr   who operated upon his son -- and was suspended subsequently by the   -- was found to have rejoined Global Hospital as 'consultant'. When contacted, the doctor blamed Nikhil's father for the mess up. 
 
 "The surgery was successful and the patient was recovering well. However, his father intervened and made a mess of it. Had he stayed away,   would have grown by three inches by now," said Bhushan, however maintaining that he would not perform another limb-lengthening surgery in the future. And that's not because his last surgery was a failure but because the issue was blown out of proportion, he said.
