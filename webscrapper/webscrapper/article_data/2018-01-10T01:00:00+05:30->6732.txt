Recently,   Rajinikanth put all speculations to rest and announced that he is indeed all set to form a new party and will be actively involved in politics. This is not the first time that a celebrity with stature and a huge fan-following has stepped into the political arena. Some of them have even gone on to become successful politicians. In fact, several movie stars from the South have been formidable politicians with long-running political careers.

 Recently, when BT spoke to one the biggest Bengali stars,  , during his visit to Mumbai, he dismissed the thought of joining politics and stressed on the fact that the only thing he desires to be is an actor. In a career spanning more than thirty years, Prosenjit has not just been a matinee idol but has also successfully bridged the gap between art and commercial  . He tells us, “Politics is a big no-no for me. I’m not a person who can go through that journey in life. When the Chief Minister of West Bengal,  , asked me about it, I admitted that everyone has a calling and are specialists in doing a particular job. Even today, when I wake up in the morning, I wonder what kind of opportunities as far as acting is concerned, will come my way. I was born to be an actor and I haven’t exhausted myself in this particular field. So, I cannot think of doing something else, as I am consumed by my profession.” Bengal has seen other actors like Roopa Ganguly, Dev, Moon Moon Sen, Satabdi Roy and Tapas Paul turn politicians, but it seems Prosenjit will purely stick to what he knows best – cinema.
