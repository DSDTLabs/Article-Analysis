Twisty Tails is the new kid on the block, housing eight Havanese puppies as hosts. Their antics will leave the customers amused, and the novel idea of dining with puppies might just catch on! We got a chance to peek inside during this launch event, which even saw a fashion show with the pooches on the ramp. The place is a bungalow turned into a café. And the owners aver there’s a story behind the whole endeavour: The 50-year-old building’s transformation into a colourful and vibrant, pet-friendly resto-café is astounding. The entire place is themed and divided into three categories ‘Puppy love’, ‘Dog Café’ and ‘Resto Café’.   The chamber called ‘Puppy Love’ has the best welcome in store for the customers! It is here that the little fur balls keep moving from one spot to the other, enjoying all the attention they get! The ‘Dog Café’ is where you get to bring your canine buddies. Your dog will sure heave a sigh of relief as you tag him along for a nice meal! There’s even a special menu designed for dogs. The ‘Resto Café’ is the third division, where you will be served a line of delicious lip-smacking dishes from Continental, north Indian, Tandoori and Asian cuisines.    Being the first of its kind in Chennai, Twisty Tails was once nothing but an idea. It all started when Rekha, the owner of these furry delights realised the need for pet-friendly cafes in Chennai. Along with her friends Vikram, Ajay and Entedine, a restaurant concept designing and execution company, the idea became possible.
