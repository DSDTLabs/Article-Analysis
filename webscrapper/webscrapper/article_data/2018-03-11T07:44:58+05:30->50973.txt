LUDHIANA: The demolition drive conducted in   spelt trouble for MLA Surinder Dawar, as a day after the demolition, people staged a protest outside his office on   on Saturday. The protestors claimed that in some media reports, it was mentioned that the demolition was carried out on Dawar’s directions, so they gathered outside his office to protest against him. However, Dawar was not present in his office at that time, but when he was contacted, he denied having any hand in the drive.

 The protestors alleged the MC demolished the structures of their shops and ‘dhabas’ from where they were earning their livelihood, and they read in some papers that area MLA Dawar supported the drive. They also claimed they protested, but then some   leaders and supporters of the MLA reached there, and gave the MLA’s message that he was not involved in the drive.
 
 Congress block president   said he got the confusion of the protestors cleared by interacting with MC officials (who conducted the demolition drive), and MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh. He said they would meet the MC commissioner on Monday as well, to find out how the MLA’s name was used in the drive. 
 
 Dawar said: “I am not a person who favours demolition drives and disturbs the livelihood of poor people. Moreover, I had no clue about this drive, and I don’t know who gave my name.” He said he had asked MC officials not to trouble poor people, and he would go and meet those persons on Monday.
 
 MC had conducted a demolition drive on Friday, in which more than 60 illegal structures were razed in Transport Nagar, and the members of transporters’ associations also accompanied MC officials.
