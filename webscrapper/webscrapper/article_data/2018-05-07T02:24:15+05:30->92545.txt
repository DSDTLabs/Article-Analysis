GURUGRAM: The residents of five villages — Gwalpahari, Bandhwari, Baliyawas, Ghata and Ullawas — met PWD minister   and MCG officials on Sunday seeking reallocation of the Bandhwari waste treatment plant.

 The meeting was conducted after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar brushed aside environmental concerns about the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant and laid down the foundation stone of the plant last month. 
 
 The   told the minister and the officials that they were ready to help the authorities select a different site for the setting up of the WTE plant. “We want the corporation to conduct a fresh survey and select an alternative spot for the plant. We will assist them, if they want, to select a site with no vegetation. We also informed the minister about waste being transported from Faridabad and dumped a Bandhwar. He assured us that the Faridabad authorities will be instructed to stop the practice immediately,” said Dheeraj Tanwar, a resident of Bandhwari.
 
 “The villagers have handed over their demands and we are looking into it. However, there are too many parameters that have to be met by the authorities before selecting a site for the waste treatment plant. Also, many departments are involved in this process. Hence this will take some time,” said a senior MCG official.
 
 MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav told TOI, “We are going to constitute a team of officials to look for an alternative site. We are ready to explore options. However, we will have to see its feasibility.”
 
 Meanwhile, the green activists are asking the authorities to follow the solid waste management rules of 2016. 
 
 “The problem is the authorities and the villagers are still thinking about the dumping of waste. Whereas, the law states that it should be treat at source,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist.
