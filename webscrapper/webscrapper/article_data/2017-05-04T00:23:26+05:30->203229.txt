Vadodara: A section of sanitation workers of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) protesting regarding rules of their employment, stay put at the civic bodyâ€™s headquarters overnight since Tuesday evening. The workers left the VMC office at Khanderao Market only after getting an assurance regarding their demands.

 Around 600 workers who were already working with the VMC for the last few months on daily wages were asked to take up employment on contract by the civic body. A section of these workers while willing to take up jobs on contract were insisting that their services should be continued even after the 11-month contract period got over.
 
 The workers were also demanding that the VMC should do away with a bond that it wanted to take from the workers to ensure that they worked for the entire contract period. Their other demands included deduction of provident fund, priority to contract workers in filling full-time posts and giving pay hikes to them every year.
 
 The workers had earlier held protests on Monday, but their demands were not met till Tuesday evening. 
 
 Insisting on a meeting with mayor Bharat Dangar, the workers stay put at the VMC headquarters throughout Tuesday night. Dangar who was out of station, met the workers on Wednesday morning.
 
 Dangar heard their demands and asked the VMC officials to look into them. 
 
 The officials assured the workers that their demands would be met with and the bonds would not be taken from them. The workers left the Khanderao Market campus only after the assurance. Unions of sanitation workers on Friday evening announced that a settlement had been reached and they were ending the agitation.
