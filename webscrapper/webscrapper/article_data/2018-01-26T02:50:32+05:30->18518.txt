NEW DELHI:   invited to celebrate “accessible election” by   complained of inaccessibility to the venue. Some of them also said they were turned back by security officials who blocked their entry.

But I was disallowed entry and told to leave my scooter. This despite the fact that I had parking and event passes,” said para athlete  .
 
 He claimed that despite his pleas, the security officials refused to allow his vehicle inside the venue. “I then decided to leave. But before that I texted about the problem I faced to officials and some of my friends. This might have reached EC, which then called me up to request me to come back. But I decided not to return as I had come too far from the location,” Raj said. 
 
 Raj claimed that   is not accessible to the disabled and that the security officials are not sensitised enough to know about their problems. “They do not know that the programme going on was for the disabled,” he said.
 
 But EC officials said Raj had come late and by then it was the time of the President’s arrival. “We gave him a phone call and even sent our volunteers to receive him but he had left by them,” the official said.
 
 Another complaint was made by disability rights activist Dr Satendra Singh. He took to social media to express surprise about the lack of facilities. “Even though the event was to make elections accessible to the disabled, there was no plan for them at the event. There were no signings, no hand railings at the entrance ramp,” Singh said
 
 He added, “Fortunately a wheelchair-bound man didn’t come for the event.”
 
 EC officials though said the venue was accessible to all and there were volunteers to assist.
