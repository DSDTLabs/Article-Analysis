BENGALURU: Sunday saw another example of how   is facing serious threats. A   was not only chopped, but its   to ensure it never sprouts again.

 Advocate Umesh S Kumar, who is also the president of Cubbon Park Walkers’ Association, has videographed the roots of the chopped eucalyptus tree going up in flames.
 
 “The spot is right in front of a construction site and next to the Accenture campus. I was passing by the stretch around noon and could see flames coming out of the tree’s roots; a bottle of petrol lay nearby. A labourer at the spot had apparently setthe rootson fire. He said he was only following instructions from his bosses,” said Umesh.
 
 Umesh suspects the builder associated with the new construction may have asked hislabourers tocutthetreeto create easy access to the building. “I could see that more trees had been pruned and their foliage lay on the footpath. I will file a police complaint regarding this. Citizens like us have been seeing these trees for decades. It hurts to see them dead suddenly,” he added.
 
 Chola Raj, head of BBMP forest cell, said cutting trees without seeking necessary permission is illegal and attracts punishment. “We will investigate the matter and check if permission was granted to fell this tree,” he added.
