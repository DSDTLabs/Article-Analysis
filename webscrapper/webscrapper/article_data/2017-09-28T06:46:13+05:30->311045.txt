LUCKNOW: The   (SEC) is gearing up to hold urban local bodies (ULBs)/mayoral elections in four   after November 20. The notification is likely to be issued on October 25.

 Sources said the commission would soon start holding review meetings with IGs of various police zones to assess law and order situation in the state. State Election Commissioner SK Agarwal told TOI that the commission was working towards a plan to get elections conducted after November 20 and complete the process by December first week.
 
 “The commission has asked state government to complete the process of voters list verification, delimitation of wards and reservation of mayoral seats in a timebound manner,” he said.
 
 In all, 653 urban local bodies, including 16 municipal corporations, will go to polls. In 2012, elections were held for 14 municipal corporations. This year, state government decided to constitute municipal corporations in Ayodhya and Mathura-Vrindavan. According to SEC records, 3.22 voters are registered with the commission. Sources said the number may be revised after verification of voters’ list.
 
 With the poll panel setting the countdown to the much-awaited local bodies/mayoral elections, the spotlight will be back on an electoral contest between the BJP and the opposition comprising Congress, SP and BSP in Uttar Pradesh. SP and Congress, which formed alliance in UP assembly elections, are likely come again together in the local bodies elections. Focus will also be on the Mayawati-led BSP which has decided to contest on all mayoral and local bodies seats on the party symbol. BJP was a big gainer in the last urban bodies elections, winning 12 out of 14 mayoral seats.
 
 Agarwal reiterated that   in mayoral seats will be held through electric voting machines (EVMs) while ballot papers would be used in nagar palika parishad and nagar panchayat polls. He said the commission would use M1 type EVMs which, though, do not support the VVPAT (voter verifiable paper audit trail). Sources said the commission had sought VVPAT supporting M2 type EVMs from the Election Commission but that was denied. 
 
 This was also done after BSP chief Mayawati’s accusations—that EVMs got tampered during UP assembly elections— gained traction with 16 other parties, including the Trinamool Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party backing the charges. Congress too has been demanding to revert to paper ballots, though a few senior leaders have distanced themselves from such claims.
