Belagavi: The forest department has taken up the gruesome incident involving a panther, whose four legs had been chopped off, in Khanapur forest, and ordered a probe.

 Forest officials had found a dead panther in the Londa range on April 16, with its legs cut off and its head crushed brutally. The department, considering the seriousness of the crime, began investigation and took a wildlife dog squad to the spot but failed to get any clues about the miscreants.
 
 According to the postmortem report, the panther had died due to illness and doesn’t have any big injuries on the body. However, wildlife lovers have urged a fair and quick probe and stringent action against the culprits.
 
 Forest department officials said it may not be the job of professional poachers, who take away the skin, but of locals.
 
 Deputy conservator of forests (DCF) Basavaraj Patil told TOI, “We are still confused whether this is the act of poachers or local villagers because poachers hunt panthers or tigers for their skin which is in high demand in the international market. But of what use are legs to locals, and why have they taken so much effort to cut the legs?”
 
 According to Patil, the department’s efforts had considerably reduced poaching of animals in Khanapur forest over the past year, barring some scattered incidents. Several measures have been taken to control poaching, like forming of anti-poaching camps, with at least four members in each camp. Two watch towers have also been built to keep vigil on the movement of poachers, he said.
