What's as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, or being obese, but does not get talked about as a health crisis? Loneliness. Never before have human beings been as lonely as they are today despite living in tightly packed cities and carrying an army of constantly interrupting 'friends' and 'connections' in their pockets. It is taking a toll on not only lifespans but also productivity, says Vice Admiral Vivek H Murthy, surgeon general of USA until April this year.

 "In the workplace, many employees - and half of CEOs -report feeling lonely in their roles," Murthy says, and the number of people with a close confidant in their lives is declining. Loneliness is not the same as being alone. You may be surrounded by people, but if you feel you do not have adequate social connections, you are lonely .
 
 Why is it dangerous? "Over thousands of years the value of social connection has become baked into our nervous system such that the absence of such a protective force creates a stress state in the body. "Chronic stress raises the level of the hormone cortisol and inflammation in the body. It increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, joint disease, depression, obesity , and premature death.
 
 That's the bodily harm, but stress also affects "decision making, planning, emotional regulation, analysis, and abstract thinking." A stressed employee or CEO is less productive, and that's the link between loneliness and the bottom line. "At work, loneliness reduces task performance, limits creativity, and impairs other aspects of executive function such as reasoning and decision making."
