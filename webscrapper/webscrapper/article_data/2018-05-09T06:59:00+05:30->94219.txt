In his 27-year service, he has served in almost every district of Punjab, including the Chandigarh district court. Singh is recognized as an efficient judge who maintains a very low profile and is accessible to the bar. 
 
 Sources confirmed that most of the members of Singh's family have a legal background. His father Swinder Singh Kamal was also in the state judicial services.
 
 Very few know that his wife, Gulchoo Jolly, who holds a master's degree in law, is an actress and has worked in several Hindi and Punjabi movies, including Band Baja Baraat, Sharik, Carry on Jatta-I.
