NEW DELHI: For 10 days, around 100 students of GB   Government Engineering College have been sleeping in the college, demanding a better   and infrastructure. On March 9, TOI had reported their unique protest. That got the higher authorities to react. 

 On Thursday, college principal   informed us that after our report, the additional director of technical education visited the campus and promised swift action in getting a new and better campus. 
 
 “The students need not worry, for a campus will soon be built for them,” Maji said, adding that he himself went and discussed the plan with the department. 
 
 But many students weren’t convinced. “The additional director has no powers. His assurance means nothing. The director should have personally come and discussed with us,” said a protesting student. 
 
 Earlier on Wednesday, over 200 students and over 50 parents and alumni had participated in a candlelight vigil. 
 
 “Our parents were supportive of our night stays on campus. But this time, they decided to come out to show solidarity with us,” said a 4th-year mechanical engineering student. 
 
 Students had decided to sleep in the hostels as the college itself was a makeshift one built in hostel building. 
 
 “The classes are held in modified dormitories that have poor acoustics. Also, there are only has nine rooms that are insufficient to hold 12 classes. The study environment here is poor,” said another student.
