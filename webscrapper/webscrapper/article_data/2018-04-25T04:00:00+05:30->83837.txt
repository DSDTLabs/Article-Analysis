Surat: As people from north India once again upped the ante against central government alleging neglect of migrant population’s demands to run more trains between Surat and their states, the Western Railway (WR) has issued a statement saying that 15 new trains from Mumbai and Gujarat have been introduced for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. 

 Uttar Bharatiya Rail Sangarsh Sammiti (UBRSS) had threatened to block trains at Surat railway station on April 26 to protest against the failure of the Centre to not accept their long-pending demands to increase the number of trains going toward states in north India. 
 
 The WR’s chief public relation officer (CPRO) in an official communique stated that WR has introduced 15 new trains from Mumbai and Gujarat, mostly from and via Surat-Udhna junctions, in previous years besides running holiday special trains for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 
 
 UBRSS leader Shaan Khan said, “WR has introduced trains via Surat and Udhana to states in north India, but the problem is that migrant passengers are not getting reservation quota and have to travel in general coaches. We have been demanding that WR should start special trains originating either from Surat or Vadodara for states in north India. We are going ahead with our train blockade programme on April 26.” 
 
 Member of passenger service committee (PSC), ministry of railways, Rakesh Shah said, “Last year in November I had represented to the railway minister the need to bring at least five locked coaches of Bandra-Gorakhpur Express from Mumbai stations. The locks of the coaches should be opened at Surat railway station to facilitate migrant passengers going toward Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The ministry has accepted the demand and two locked coaches will be opened in Surat.”
