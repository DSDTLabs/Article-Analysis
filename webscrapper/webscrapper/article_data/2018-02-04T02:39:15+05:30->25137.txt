Ghaziabad: Two men, allegedly involved in the grabbing of 70 bigha (28 acres) of   worth Rs 100 crore in  , were arrested on Friday night from their village.

 The two have been arrested under the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters And Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act. Ten other members of the group, who have also been booked under the Act, are on the run.
 
 The arrested persons, identified as   (55) and Subhash (44), are said to be the masterminds.
 
 SHO, Vijay Nagar police station, Naresh Kumar   said, “The duo and the rest of the gang members are relatives and live in Behrampur village. They collectively own nearly 28 acres of land in Behrampur. Next to their piece of land is another 28 acres of land which earlier belonged the gram samaj, but was later acquired by Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation after its inception in early 1990s. This land was under illegal occupation of Leeladhar and his accomplices for several decades. Seeing no action against them, they had built farm houses on it and sold them to people.”
 
 “On December 13, 2017, an FIR was lodged against all the accused for trespassing and violating rules of Uttar Pradesh Urban Planning and Development Act after GMC filed a complaint. The corporation subsequently carried out a demolition drive on December 22 and also freed the land, but in the meantime, Leeladhar and his aides approached the   and got a stay order on their arrest. After filing charge sheet in GMC case, we booked all the accused under the Gangsters Act on January 25,” the SHO added.
 
 Singh informed the main occupation of the gang is to grab people’s land and then sell it to unsuspecting customers. “Due to their clout, no person dared to file a complaint against them. This comes under organised crime and hence the Gangsters Act was slapped on them,” he added.
