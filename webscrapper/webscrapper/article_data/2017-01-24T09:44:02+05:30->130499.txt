JALANDHAR:   (UAD) leaders   and Gurdeep Singh came out in support of AAP MP  , who is contesting against SAD chief and deputy CM   from Jalalabad constituency, on Monday, saying that they would appeal to the people to vote for the AAP leader.

 “It is the responsibility of religious leaders to ensure defeat of those responsible for sacrilege at Bargari and subsequent firing at Behbal Kalan and our special appeal is to Dhuma,“ the duo said here.
 
 They said as Mann was in a position to defeat Sukhbir, they would appeal people to support him. They made it clear that they would not support Ravneet Singh Bittu of the Congress. Both said they were not yet clear that who was in a position to defeat chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in Lambi, but the voters should unite their support for one candidate who would defeat him.
 
 They said they were not averse to support   chief Captain Aamarinder Singh if he could defeat Badal.
