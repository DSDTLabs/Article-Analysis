LUCKNOW: As many as 25 important clinical tests will now be available free of cost for patients at seven government hospitals in Lucknow and nodal centres of 51 district hospitals in the state.

 These include additional tests for dengue, chikungunya, platelet count and different cultures, tests for heart attacks, blood cancer and lymphoma, spondylitis, early diagnosis of kidney damage, pre-operative tests, tests for diagnosis of thalassemia and liver function and for vitamin D3 determination. These tests are costly in a private set-up. Samples for these tests can be taken at Balrampur hospital, Civil hospital, Avanti Bai hospital, Rani Laxmi Bai hospital, Lok Bandhu Shri Raj Narayan combined hospital,   and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia combined hospital and sent to RMLIMS as the nodal centre. Until now, these tests were not covered under the   Strengthening Pariyojna that already has a number of tests as free service in government hospitals. 
 
  “It was after re-evaluation of the programme after a year of service that these 25 tests were added, based on high demand,” said Prof Nuzhat Husain, head of the pathology department at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences.
