GURUGRAM: People living near Bandhwari as well as green activists can raise objections or express their concerns, if any, over the upcoming integrated solid waste management facility there, during a   scheduled for March 21.

 The   State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) will soon issue a notice for the public hearing, for an environment impact assessment as per a notification issued in 2006.
 
 According to the MoEF rules, construction of any new project or expansion or modernisation of an existing project or capacity addition shall be done only after getting an environmental clearance from the central government or the State-level  .
 
 “The public hearing is part of the process for getting an environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change,” said a senior MCG official.
 
 Launched by chief minister   last year in August, the integrated waste management project includes door-to-door waste collection by an appointed agency, segregation of waste, composting of organic waste. Also, there are plans to convert the inorganic waste into energy. The whole project is estimated to cost Rs 450 crore. But, many residents’ groups and environmentalists have raised concerns over the waste-to-energy plant because, they claimed, the model had not been successful anywhere in the country.
 
 “Waste-to -energy plants have not been very useful as they take up more resources than what they generate. 
 
 “Moreover, the cost of production is generally more than the rate at which power might be used at the end of the process,” said Dr Shyamala Mani, a professor at National Institute of Urban Affairs.
