Contrary to his image of being an epitome of calmness — as seen during the recently-concluded season of ' ' — the actor, who is the captain of his cricket team, was heard hurling abuses and using foul language on  . Ask him why he resorted to such language and he says, “I don’t think that in this age and world, there would be someone who never hurls abuses or loses his cool. Having said that, I was only abusing myself, as I was not happy with the way we were performing on the field.” 
Considering the fact that   didn’t resort to such behaviour during his stay in the 'Bigg Boss' house, was he asked to abuse in a bid to garner ratings for the show? “Not at all. I was not like that on 'Bigg Boss' because it was not required. Like I said, I used foul language because I was unhappy with the way things are happening on the show.”
