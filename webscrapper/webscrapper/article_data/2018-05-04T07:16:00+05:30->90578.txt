GHAZIABAD: As many as 15 people were   in the past two days for running   betting rackets in Sahibabad and Kotwali areas. In the Kotwali area, seven persons, including an assistant professor in mathematics at   University, a stock broker and an advocate were arrested for running the   racket.

 In Sahibabad, eight men including three OLA cab drivers and a BTech student were found involved in the   activity. Several TV sets, laptops, mobile phones, wi-fi sets and set-top boxes, besides Rs 56,000 in cash were seized from the accused. They used mobile apps to facilitate the betting, said an officer.
 
 “On Wednesday, two persons—Deepanshu Sharma, an advocate, and Prateek Kaushik, a senior executive—with a battery-manufacturing company, were detained after they were found to be betting on an IPL match between Delhi and Rajasthan. On questioning, they revealed that the racket was being operated from an office in Raj Nagar District Centre. A raid was conducted at the office and five persons were caught red-handed. The profiles of the persons who were arrested from RDC are quite interesting,” said SP (city) Akash Tomar.
 
 One of them is Deepak Garg, a stockbroker and the office belonged to him from where the racket was being run. His associates are assistant professor Sachin Kumar Tyagi and Manoj, who acted as a negotiator between gamblers and the racket members. The three of them have a one-third share in this illegal business. The remaining two are Gurpreet Singh, a Loha Mandi-based financier, and Sameer Saini, an attendant of Deepak.
 
 “The group has recently ventured in this area. We have come across the name of an old timer who was working in the background. We will soon arrest him. The mathematics professor, who has done masters in the subject from Gurukul Kangri University and has secured 98 percentile in GATE, has been found to be quite an expert in understanding the betting pattern, thus enhancing the profit margin for themselves,” he said.
