Coimbatore: City corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan added another feather in his cap on Saturday when he received the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Memorial Award on Innovation in Governance (Kiga) at an event held in New Delhi. The commissioner was honoured for using crowdfunding platforms to build toilets in the city under the Swachh Bharat Mission. “It is a happy moment. It motivates me to work harder and achieve more. When such efforts are recognised, it motivates us to break the monotony,” Vijayakarthikeyan told TOI. The award, from the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Centre, is given to selected individuals and institutions for exemplary work in improving governance and delivering value to the citizens. This is the second edition of the event, that was started on October 15, 2016, on the 85th birth anniversary of APJ Abdul Kalam. The centre organises the award ceremony to recognise the efforts of those who use cutting-edge technology, innovative management and out-of-box thinking to transform the role and impact of governance in India and across the world. Vijayakarthikeyan had earlier won awards at the Skoch Summit for ten projects implemented in the city in 2017. He is also a recipient of ‘Pride of Coimbatore’ constituted by the Round Table India.
