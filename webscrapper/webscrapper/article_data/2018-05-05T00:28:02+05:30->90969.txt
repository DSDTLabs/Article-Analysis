Trichy: The disappointment over the Supreme Court order to release 4 tmc of water from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu instead of forming Cauvery management board (CMB) had its repercussions with the functionaries and cadres of CPM attempting to stage train blockade in Trichy on Friday. The police arrested 39 protestors including one woman.

 As soon as the apex court directive was out on Thursday, the delta districts felt the heat of protests from political parties and farmers associations. On the second day, CPM jumped on the bandwagon. Around 50 men and women of the party staged a demonstration at the Trichy junction near central bus stand, following which they took out a procession to Trichy railway junction.
 
 CPM led by its Trichy district secretary R Raja made an attempt to enter the railway junction. The heavy police personnel deployed already there prevented them from entering the junction, leading to a minor scuffle between the police and the protestors.
 
 Eventually, the police managed to push them into their vehicle and took them away from the area foiling their attempt. They were kept in a marriage following their arrest. The police released them later in the evening.
