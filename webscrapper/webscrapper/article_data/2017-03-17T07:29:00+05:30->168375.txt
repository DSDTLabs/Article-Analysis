AMRITSAR: There is much disappointment among the supporters of   MLA   in Amritsar on his not being declared No. 2 in the Captain Amarinder Singh’s new cabinet. Many here believe that he was once again deceived and his wings clipped even by his new party.

 Before Sidhu joined the Congress, it was widely speculated that the party had reached an agreement to use his celebrity status, clean image, fiery campaigning style and his resentment against the SAD-BJP leadership in return for the deputy chief minister’s post. However, Sidhu and Congress leaders had repeatedly denied having struck any such deal.
 
 The first reaction came from one of Sidhu’s staunch supporter and BJP’s former Amritsar unit spokesperson Somdev Sharma. He said, “Sidhu has been jettisoned by the Congress. His stature was used to sink the ship of Badals. He deserved to be the deputy CM if the state Congress leadership really wanted to give a transparent government but he has been put at number three.”
 
 Stating that two of a trade seldom agree, another staunch Sidhu supporter and former   district president Colonel Amrik Singh (retd) said that placing the former Indian opener at third place in the government only reflected the “insecurity of Amarinder”. “Sidhu is the future of Punjab,” he added.
 
 “It’s not a good omen for Punjab as the fight for power in the Congress has already begun. Though we are in opposition, we believe that Amarinder should have kept the promise,” said AAP state vice-president ( ) Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal.
