HYDERABAD: A day after the murder of a city hospital receptionist   came to light, Ramannapet police on Wednesday arrested her lover  , 25, who allegedly killed her on Saturday night and buried the body at an agricultural field in Bujilapur village in  

 
 The incident came to light on Tuesday when police recovered Bhargavi’s body from an agricultural field in Naresh’s native Bujilapur village. “Narender met Bhargavi nearly five years ago at an event, when both were in college. Narender was in Degree, while Bhargavi was pursuing MBA,” assistant commissioner of police, Choutuppal, S Ramesh said.
  
  
 
 
 The couple exchanged numbers and soon they fell in love, police said. In 2015, Narender’s marriage was fixed one Shwetha. However, his wife came to know about his affair with Bhargavi, who was from Mothkur, and divorced him a year later.
 
 “After his divorce, he continued his relationship with Bhargavi. However, she was unaware about his first marriage,” the ACP said. On March 4, Narender’s marriage was fixed again. This time Bhargavi came to know about his marriage plan. To confront him, Bhargavi called Narender on Friday and insisted on meeting him.
 
 
 “Narender asked her to come to his village, Bujilapur. Around 8.30pm on Saturday, Bhargavi reached the village. He took her to the agriculture field for a chat. As per the confession of the accused, the couple had a heated argument and Bhargavi threatened to stop his marriage,” Ramannapet inspector   said. Narender first pushed Bhargavi. She fell and her head hit a rock. She started bleeding and became unconscious. The culprit decided to eliminate her. He then bludgeoned her with rock, police said.
 
 
 “After reaching Bujilapur village, Bhargavi called her sister and informed about her whereabouts. As she did not return, her parents became worried and suspected Narender’s involvement in the missing case,” the ACP added.
