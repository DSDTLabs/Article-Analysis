Plots of land will now be more affordable in Coimbatore. The commissioner of Town and Country Planning has passed a circular reducing the minimum plot size in a layout from 1,500sqft to 800sqft. In a February 26 circular, the empowered committee said the earlier requirement of 1,500sqft posed density issues and raised land cost. Developers welcome the move, saying 30% of buyers sought smaller plots. 

 "For nearly two decades, we had to sell 1,500sqft plots as   and Country Planning (DTCP) required a minimum setback space of 3ft. But growing demand for land and increasing population resulted in a real estate boom in tier II and tier III cities. So, we requested the DTCP authorities to make 800sqft the minimum plot area in DTCP approved layouts as well," said   chairman K Venkatesan. "This will help land owners build houses legally and the government will also gain revenue."
 
 Ajit Kumar Chordia, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, TN, said more beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awaaz Yojna will benefit. But there would not be any fall in land prices due to this, he said.
 
 Senior DTCP officials said several representations had been made on this issue since 2010. "This decision was taken to bring uniformity between   and DTCP rules. This would also increase land affordability," said a senior official. 
 
 But activists said people would still be affected as land prices had skyrocketed and buying smaller or bigger plots had become difficult. "The DTCP should ensure that promoters are rational in pricing the layouts. Instead of helping real-estate developers, they should help buyers," said  , secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause.
