KOLKATA: The airport bound traffic was badly hit when locals blocked   crossing for around 20 minutes in protest against the death of a local youth in a clash over collection of parking fees. 

 Ultadanga being the city's gateway from the airport, even a 20-minute blockade had a cascading impact. The airport-bound traffic had already been moving at a snail's pace because of construction of a number of pedestrian underpasses across VIP Road.
 
 The clash over parking fee collection at illegal parking lots took place on Thursday night between a youth called Laltu and another youth, Bhola, at Murari Pukur. Police said both Laltu and Bhola were trying to capture the parking lot which generates a steady income.
 
 The altercation over the fee collection soon turned into street fight when Bhola and his associates assaulted Laltu severely and left him there on the street in an unconscious state. Locals later rushed him to R G   where he succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. Bhola and his associates absconded ever since Laltu was taken to hospital.
 
 Soon after Laltu died, local started agitating. The protests soon spilled onto the road and they blocked the busy Ultadanga crossing, leaving the airport bound traffic crippled. Sensing trouble, senior traffic police officers rushed to the spot and persuaded the irate mob to withdraw the blockade. They were promised that a thorough investigation will be carried out and the culprits of his murder will be booked. Locals then withdrew the blockade.
 
 However, by the time, the damage was done. "There was huge pile up of vehicles at the crossing. Many feared missing flight. Police finally persuaded them to withdraw blockade," said traffic police officer.
