Reckless and unchecked burning of garbage is rampant in various parts of the city. Both the residents and sanitation employees, who have to collect the garbage and ensure that it goes to the Vellaikkal solid waste management yard, too involve in burning waste.

 Though burning of garbage is banned because of its environmental impact and the health problems it creates, sanitation employees continue to burn the waste as an easier way to dispose it.
 
 K Selvarani, a resident of New Bangajam Colony said, "Heaps of waste including plastic and wires are regularly burnt in the Vaigai River. Often corporation employees themselves do it just to save the extra work of shifting the garbage to the dumping yard," she said.
 
 Residents say that burning of wastes is seen in various places such as Iravathanallur, K Pudur, Anaiyur, Madakulam and Sellur. S Senthilnathan from Iravathanallur said that garbage is burnt there despite the objection from the residents. Children and elderly are affected by this, he said.
 
 According to sources from the Madurai Corporation, plastic constitute one percent of the garbage collected. The city generates around six tonnes of plastic waste a day.
 
 Head of Environment Management of Engineering Staff College in Hyderabad Subha Muthu Kumar said that burning of waste containing plastic can cause health hazards like respiratory problems. Dioxins and furans emanate from the smoke creating health problem to humans.
 
 When contacted, a health official said that they would conduct an inspection and take appropriate action against the employees if found burning waste.
