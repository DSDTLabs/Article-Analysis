Kolhapur: Police have invoked Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against a six member gang from Ichalkaranji. Superintendent of Police Sanjay Mohite has stated that two more gangs are on their radar and action against them will be taken soon.

 MCOCA was enacted by the state government in 1999 to combat terrorism and organised crime. Anticipatory bail is not available to anyone accused of having committed an offence under MCOCA. The Act also gives police the authority to intercept oral and written communication.
 
 The six members of the gang have been identified as the leader Avinash Shekhar Jadhav alias Germany, Akash Bhilugade, Naim Hasan Kukutnur, Manoj Waman Shingare (all residents of Ligade farm, Ichalkaranji). Two others are named Bajarang Arun Fatale alias Bachake (residing near Datta Mandir in Ichalkaranji) and Prashant Vinayak Kajawe (resident of Jawahar Nagar, Ichalkaranji).
 
 A senior police officer said, “The gang was operating in Ichalkaranji, Hatkanangle and Shirol taluka under the name ‘German’ gang. They were involved in a series of criminal activities such as extortion, attempt to murder and other such crimes under the jurisdiction of various police stations in the district.”
 
 The officer said, “We had initiated prohibitory action against the gang members but they continued their criminal activities. Following this we decided to invoke MCOCA against the gang and submitted the proposal to higher authorities.”
