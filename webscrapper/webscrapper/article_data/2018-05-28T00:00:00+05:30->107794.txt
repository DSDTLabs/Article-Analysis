Allu Sirish’s next film, ABCD, will see Sandalwood composer   debut in Tollywood. We hear it was a song from #Chamak that first made   sit up and take notice of Judah’s talent. Sirish says, “I’ve been wanting to bring a new kind of sound to   from long, but somehow things didn’t materialise. I discovered Judah’s music by accident. A friend sent me  . I got hooked and started exploring his other albums including Badmaash and Operation Alamelamma. I loved them. I discussed with my director   who loved his music too and was keen to have him onboard. And here we are. We’re excited to launch   in Telugu cinema. He’s already scored two catchy tunes for us.”
Judah, too, is very excited about this. He says, “When I got a call from Sirish saying, I first wondered if I was being pranked. But he said that he had heard my music and wanted to meet me. I went to Hyderabad and I was onboard. I’m really happy to be a part of a film like this.”
