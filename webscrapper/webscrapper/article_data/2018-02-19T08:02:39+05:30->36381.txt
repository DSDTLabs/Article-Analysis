BENGALURU: For a city whose residents rely on   on a daily basis, having a discussion about apps and their impact on multiple lives was essential. On Friday, City Scripts, Indian Institute of Human Settlements’ ( ) festival dedictated to city writing, saw academic Aditi Surie engaging in a conversation with professor, historian and writer Mukul Kesavan on ‘Uber-ed: Bengaluru’s platform economy and urban subjectivities’.

 Have app-basedcab services like Uber and   helped created a sense of entrepreneurship in theinformal sector? Should the state step in to draft laws and policies for these drivers? What makes Uber such a favourite among the middle-class? The session saw Surie and Kesavan expounding their views, based on research and of course, conversations with Uber drivers themselves. Kesavan attributed Uber’s success to the fact that it “has transformedour middle-classlives. It has brought in a sense of security and predictability, and to experience the convenience of it is so shocking. There is a kind of magic perfection with which it works that it leaves me feeling incredulous most of the time”.
 
 While everything may not be rosy about Uber, Ola and similar services, Kesavan felt platform-based apps are here to stay. Explaining his reasons, he said, “To every driver, Uber represents a kind of hard-won, hardworking stability of the sort that he has never known before. In fact, one of them told me that the best thing about Uber was that he got paid every week.”
 
 “Delhiwallahs are way civil and politer to Uber drivers than they are to autodrivers,” he observed. “A driver making Rs 30,000-35,000 every month is earning as much money as a skilled artisan. So, Uber has brought in a kind of urbanity, a kind of set of bourgeois norms, which these drivers, however much they grumble, are passionately committed to.”
