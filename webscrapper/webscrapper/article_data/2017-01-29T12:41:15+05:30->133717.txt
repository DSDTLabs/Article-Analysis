INDORE:   is one of the major intersections in the city as well as the second most accident prone area. In the past four years, there have been 66 accidents in which 6 people lost their lives. 

 The 300-metre connecting stretch between Vijay Nagar and Rasoma Square does not have a proper signal system, adversely affecting traffic. The oversized Vijay Nagar rotary is another reason which leads to jams. Traffic police officials claim several measures are being taken to control the situation however it has not improved.
 
 Vehicles ignore traffic signals, causing problems for others on the road. Impatient and reckless drivers, especially those of goods and carrier vehicles, add to commuters’ woes.
 
 Vehicles from   going towards Vijay Nagar and from   area going towards C-21 mall get in the way of each other because they fail to follow the signals.
 
 Commuters have demand changes to signal timings and deploying cops to regulate traffic at this busy junction. A commuter,  , said passing through this square, especially in the mornings and evenings, has become a problem.
 
 Local traders at this junction said motorists seem to have no fear of cops as they blatantly jump traffic signals. “Heavy fines should be levied on drivers to deter them from violating the rules,” said  , a shop owner at Bhamori Road.
 
 “Usually here are no cops present here to regulate traffic and even if one is he acts as a mute spectator,” said Jatin Kumar, another shop owner here.
 
 Traffic experts suggested deploying cops is the only solution. They also blamed authorities for failing to control those who jump signals at this junction and drive on wrong lanes, posing a risk to others.
