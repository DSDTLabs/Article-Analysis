Actor-comedian had recently posted pictures of his new ultra-swanky vanity van on his social media account and his fans' joys knew no bounds. However, given the number of controversies that Kapil has courted in the recent past, there were a few who trolled him for this new acquisition.

 Before we get to the comments in question, take a look at the picture of the van that he shared on his Instagram account:
 
  
  
  
 
 
 One of the few comments that trolled Kapil read as:
 
 "New vanity to mil gyi par show ki trp khaan se laoge .Still i blve that you are a overconfident. Is show main kis kalakar ko juta maroge SelfishPerson jiske liye baki sari duniya zero hai. [sic]"
 
 Here's another one:
 
 "Ha bhai even show k promo me bhi he has shown claiming to an autowala- abe ab agr tum comedy kroge to hm kya krenge… which clearly shows his over confidence… abhi b shayd bhai ko akal aai nhi.. purane show or movie ka ye hal dekhkr bhi." 
 
 
 Having said that, there were a few congratulatory ones as well. Take a look at the following:
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 The negativity surrounding him has to do more than something with the mid-air brawl that Kapil had had with his co-actor Sunil Grover. 
  
  
 On the work front, Kapil Sharma is all set to enthrall the audience once again with a new TV show, titled -   Sharma. It will reportedly be very different from his previous show, The Kapil Sharma Show. This show, in which he will be joined by his co-stars Chandan Prabhakar, Kiku Sharda and Sumona Chakravarti, is expected to go on-air this month (March 2018).
 
 From the looks of it, his fans have a lot to look forward to. Only time will tell if his new show will be able to recreate the magic of the once celebrated The Kapil Sharma Show.
