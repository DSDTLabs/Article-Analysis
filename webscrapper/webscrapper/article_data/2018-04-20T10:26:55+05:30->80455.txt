RAIPUR: Even as outrage over the   and   gang rapes sweeps the nation, an 11-year-old girl was raped and murdered at a wedding in Podhi village of Chhattisgarh late on Wednesday night. 

 
 A friend of the groom has been arrested. Police say he lured her away from the wedding with the promise of a soft drink, raped her and then bludgeoned her to death with bricks. He didn't even bother to cover her up, returned to the wedding, and partied as if nothing had happened, said an investigator. The child had gone to attend a relative's wedding in Podhi on Akshaya Tritiya, said Kawardha SP Lal Umed Singh. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Witnesses have told police that the suspect, 24-year-old Uttam Sahu, "had his eyes on her all evening". Just as some guests were preparing to leave, he allegedly offered to buy the girl a cold drink. Sahu took her to a dark and deserted spot near a rivulet, about 1.5km away, where he raped her, say police. Cement bricks were stacked nearby. He picked one and battered the child to death, said an investigator. "He left her body with hardly any clothes on and returned to the wedding. He had no clue that he had bloodstains on his shirt," said the SP. 
 
 A little later, the girl's family started looking for her. A few guests told them that they had last seen her with Sahu. Some of them went to question him and saw the bloodstains on his clothes. They nabbed Sahu and called police. Police found her body on Thursday morning. Sahu was arrested and charged under Indian Penal Code and POCSO for rape and  .
