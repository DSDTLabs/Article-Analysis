GURUGRAM: Tuesday night’s sudden   disrupted power supply in several parts of the city. Widespread   were reported in   1,   and sectors 3, 5, 6, 14 and 27. Many households were left waiting long hours for resumption of power supply, in some cases till Wednesday morning.

 Residents said because of the overnight outage, their water pumps didn’t work, leading to shortage of water. Power officials, however, said the rain led to tripping, which was rectified on time. “For the entire night, there was no power. Lights went off at 12.30 am and came back at 7 in the morning,” said Dinesh Vashist, RWA president of sectors 3, 5 and 6.
 
 Vashist said people suffered more because   remained affected. 
 
 Reports of outages also came from DLF Phase 4, where residents alleged that outages were becoming a daily norm. “On Tuesday, the lights went out at 11 pm and resumed at 7.25 am on Wednesday,” said Madan Binjola, a resident.
 
 In South City -1, residents said they were so used to power cuts that they didn’t even realise the fresh ones taking place because of rain.
 
 Reports of outages came from   as well even though officials maintained they had nothing to do with the rain. 
 
 “Basically PWD is building a foot bridge at the site where five of our power cables run from. They asked for our permission. They are trying to re-route the lines because of the construction work. So the Palam Vihar sub-division will continue to endure five-hour power cuts for the month of April,” said JP Dahiya, sub-divisional officer, DHBVN, Palam Vihar.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, DHBVN superintending engineer Naveen Kumar Verma could not be contacted. Related report, P 8
