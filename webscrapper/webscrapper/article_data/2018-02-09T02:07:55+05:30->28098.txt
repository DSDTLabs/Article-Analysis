Mumbai:   has lambasted the Centre for doing nothing to contain the growing cases of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. “However,   showed the courage to bring about a split in   (in 1971),” said Saamna.

 “There have been in the last one month 100 instances of Pakistan opening fire in J&K. While terrorists are tearing into the Indian territory and slaughtering our soldiers, those in power are talking of ‘pakoras’ and ‘bhajias’,” said Saamna in an editorial on Thursday, taking a dig at BJP national president Amit Shah’s recent maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha.
 
 Stating that brazen acts of terrorism have made the country hang its head in shame, Saamna alleged that the latest incident of Pakistani terrorists storming a Shrinagar hospital to free Abu Hanjala was clear evidence that the law and order situation had broken down in J&K.
