Dharamshala: After a 15-year-girl had filed a   complaint with the Palampur police, cops on Saturday arrested two minors in the case while three others are absconding. Those arrested are reportedly 17-years-old. 

 In her complaint, the girl had stated that she was raped while returning home on Thursday noon after visiting a temple. The girl along with her relative had gone to the temple on a two-wheeler. They were sitting by the roadside when a group of five youths had attacked them. 
 
 “Two of the accused have been arrested, but as they are   they had been sent for medical examination and will be handed over to their parents after that. We will produce them before the court on Sunday,” said Santosh Patial, Superintendent of Police, Kangra.
 
 The absconding accused are also reportedly minor and sources say that the crime was committed by the arrested youths, while the other three were accompanying them. 
 
 This is not first such case in Kangra when accused and survivor in a rape case are minors. Last year a 14-year-old girl had given birth in November 2017 and the accused in the case was 15-year-old boy of the same village.
