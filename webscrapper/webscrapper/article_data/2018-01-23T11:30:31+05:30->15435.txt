KOLHAPUR:   minister   singing a Kannada song at the inaugural event of Durgadevi temple in   on Friday has not gone down well with Marathi residents.

 Addressing a gathering at the temple at Tavag village of Gokak taluka in Belgaum district on Friday, Patil reportedly sang ‘Huttidare   Nadinalli Huttabeku, Meetidare Kannada Nadannu Mettabeku’, a popular song from a film of Dr Rajkumar that praises the Kannada people and soil.
 
 Both Karnataka and the state have been in a border dispute since the days of reorganisation of states on a linguistic basis. 
 
 Patil is the nodal   in the state government for the border dispute.
 
 “We condemn the minister’s act and it has created strong feelings against Patil among Marathi-speaking people residing in Karnataka,”   Kolhapur city MLA Rajesh Kshirsagar said. “It shows BJP’s attitude towards the issue and its seriousness in addressing this.”
 
 Patil issued a statement on Saturday saying there was “no political intention in singing a song praising Kannada people and it was a casual remark”.
 
 He said one of his family members had started social work in Tawag village and he had gone there on invitation. 
 
 “Addressing the gathering, people requested me to communicate in Kannada,” he said. “Following this, I spoke for two minutes in Kannada and later for 20 minutes in Hindi about rural development. There was no politics behind this and it was natural process.”
 
  general secretary Maloji Rao Ashtekar said: “Karnataka ministers and officers quote such leaders. They then say that when ministers from Maharashtra are asking Marathi-speaking people to stay in Karnataka, these people are unnecessarily creating trouble for the state.”
