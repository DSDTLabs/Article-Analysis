After designing Ranbir Kapoor's new bachelor pad,  's talented wife   is gearing up to spin magic at RK senior's residence. 

 
  
 The film producer cum interior designer has impressed the Kapoors with the look and feel of Ranbir's pad so much, that they now want their home to be redesigned by Gauri herself. Known for being quite expressive with his thoughts, Rishi reportedly couldn't stop gushing over the fact that thanks to Gauri, Ranbir's 'house' now looked like a 'home.'
 
 Interestingly,   too is in the queue. Post revamping Rishi and  's house, Gauri would be redecorating family friend Karan Johar's bedroom.
