LUDHIANA: Division V police have booked a havildar for alleged dereliction of duty, after a man accused of liquor smuggling escaped from the district courts on his watch. 

 Police have not taken any other action against Havilar Amarjeet Singh. The cop was booked on a complaint by sub-inspector Anwar   on Tuesday, while accused  , a resident of Madhopuri, had escaped on Monday. 
 
 The cop was on duty at the bakshi khana (a transitional jail in a court) of the district courts when he was given the responsibility of taking a photograph of the accused, documenting it, and then sending him to the prison. Though the cop had kept Rishi in the lock-up all along, he had brought him out for taking a photograph. 
 
 After he took the photograph, the cop left Rishi there itself and went to take photographs of other accused to be sent to prison. 
 
 During this time, the accused slipped away. On returning, the havildar sounded his higher-ups.
 
 In his police complaint, Masih has alleged that the havildar should have handed over the accused to another cop before proceeding to document other accused brought to courts. 
 
 Rishi, who is accused of allegedly smuggling liquor in 2013, had skipped bail that year and gone missing. He had approached his previous employers on Sunday for a job, but was handed over to police. Police had produced him in court on Monday, from where he was to be sent to prison. 
 
 Police have booked the havildar under sections 223 (escape from confinement or custody negligently suffered by public servant), 224 (obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
 The investigating officer of the case, assistant sub-inspector (ASI)  , said the accused was yet to be arrested. “We have also launched an operation to nab Rishi,” he said. “Investigations are on.”
