 Parrikar has been ridiculing Digvijaya since he was sworn in as chief minister.
 
 Ahead of the crucial floor test in the Goa Assembly today, Digvijaya and several other Congress leaders dashed to Goa to try and cobble together a coalition that would emerge successful in the trust vote. The BJP-led combine won with the support of 22 legislators.
 
 "The Congress (leaders) coming down (to Goa) for the floor test was possibly all a hype because it was being demanded that Digvijaya should be kept down as the general secretary. He had to do something. This happens when you come to Goa just to enjoy, not to work," Parrikar told the media here.
