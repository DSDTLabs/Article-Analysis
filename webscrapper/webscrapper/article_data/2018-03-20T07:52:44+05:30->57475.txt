AHMEDABAD: The sight of   feeding off vegetable carts near   in Kalupur is heartening proof of   “Sparrows arrive in large number in the morning and generally don’t mind the hustle and bustle of the area,” said  , a resident of Zaverivaad. “The area comes alive with their incessant chatter. Scores of people come to feed the birds.”

 The World Heritage City of Ahmedabad is as indulgent with birds as it is proud of its built heritage.
 
  “The exquisite bird-feeders that are common at almost all pols testify to the fact that harmony is not just about different communities living together but also about humans being at peace with nature,” said Prajapati. “It is no wonder then that the birds flock to these areas where they get food, water, and love.”
 
 As the world prepares to mark the World Sparrow Day on March 20, Jagat Kinkhabwala, the ‘Sparrow Man’ of Ahmedabad, said that there is a long way to go before making the once common bird a common sight again.
 
 “Fortunately, awareness has grown among citizens about the need to protect these little birds. Through our initiatives, sparrow nests have reached over 57,000 homes over a decade,” he said. 
 
 “Today, we have 6,000-plus documented cases of sparrows nesting and have learnt a lot in the process about what works and what doesn’t. A number of areas in the city are now sighting the birds again.”
 
 What are the challenges? “A recent study by the   says that the ‘versatile singer’ among the male sparrows wins the mating game,” Kinkhabwala said. 
 
 “But in urban areas, just to be heard above the noise, sparrows have to make a lot of effort. It is a documented phenomenon in the city that the sparrows’ calls have gone nocturnal.”
