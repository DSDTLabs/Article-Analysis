KOLKATA: Kolkata woke up to a cloud cover and a light drizzle in some parts of the city on Friday. 

 Even though the thunderstorm that was predicted to strike did not materialize, the temperature dropped by a couple of degrees. But the chances of a storm still exist, says the Met office. Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 33.9°C on Friday.
 
 A low-pressure trough between north Bengal and Tamil Nadu may lead to cloud formation on Saturday, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). “Premonsoon clouds are unpredictable. On Friday, we had a cloud mass that floated across Midnapore and skirted Kolkata. Had it moved along Bankura, the chances of it hitting Kolkata would have been higher. But unfortunately, Kolkata missed a thunderstorm yet again,” said G K Das, director, RMC. Since the trough persisted, clouds could form again over the weekend, added Das. But the chances of a storm materializing on Saturday were weak. “The possibility was higher on Friday,” he said.
 
 Darjeeling and Sikkim, however, were lashed by hailstorm under the influence of the trough.
 
 It had been predicted that the city could be lashed by a thunderstorm during the latter half of the week. While thunderstorms have eluded Kolkata on three occasions between February 26 and March 17, this one was predicted to have a proper impact.
