Surat: Under the banner of Gujarat Rajya Sahakari Sangh, cooperative sector leaders have decided to launch a fight against income tax (I-T) notices slapped on some milk cooperatives of south Gujarat. A meeting of state leaders is likely to take place in Kamrej on Thursday, where the final strategy would be worked out. Few days ago, three milk cooperatives of Olpad taluka received notices seeking tax payment on interest earned on their fixed deposit. On Wednesday, another co-operative Kamrej Kela Mandal received a similar notice asking it to pay up Rs 30 lakh as taxes. Incidentally, president of this mandal Ashwin Patel is an influential Surat district BJP leader and former district party president. General secretary of Rajya Sahakari Sangh Bhikha Patel told TOI, “ I-T officials have wrongly interpreted the law which has left cooperatives worried. We have decided to fight this unitedly on all fronts against these notices. We are also seeking experts advice on the issue and would make an apt representation to the central government.”  He said despite having registration as cooperatives, the I-T department is not willing to consider cooperative and district banks in this segment, which is exempted from the I-T.  According to the figures available, there are nearly 78,000-80,000 cooperative mandalis in Gujarat, which have nearly Rs 25,000 crore fixed deposits in different cooperative and district banks. At the rate of seven per cent, they earn about Rs 1,700 crore as interest annually.  “Thirty per cent interest earned would result in Rs 550 crore as I-T and the department is planning to start with assessment of the last five years. This works to huge amount and cooperative sector can’t sustain this blow,” director, Sumul, Jayesh Patel (Delad) said.
