KOCHI: With the Thiruvabharanam procession set to leave for Sabarimala on Friday, authorities are pulling out all the stops to ensure a cleaner and safer Mandalam-Makaravilakku festival season. 

 More than 1,000 workers of the much-lauded Punyam Poonkavanam project would be working an additional 30 minutes daily to keep the temple premises clean and plastic free.
 
 Additionally, workers of the   (SSS), too, would be involved in the cleaning operations. The society, formed in 1995 with the   district collector as its chairperson, has mostly people from Tamil Nadu as its workers. Collector R Girija said for most workers, the cleaning job is a devotional act. Authorities have set an age limit of 67 for the workers, who would get uniforms, free lodging and boarding, and Rs350 a day.
 
 Travancore devaswom board president A Padmakumar said this season, so far, has been cleaner. "Areas, such as Pulmedu, are completely clean and are being cleaned regularly," he said. Thousands of devotees are expected to witness the   on Sunday.
 
 Officials, meanwhile, said the   has been given high priority. Electric lights are being installed, and regular checks conducted to identify and replace faulty systems. Baggage would be randomly checked to avoid untoward incidents. 
 
 Police on Thursday arrested   (50), a native of Bengaluru for allegedly making a hoax bomb threat at Sabarimala. He had disputes with his son and in a bid to trap him made the threat that his son is carrying a bomb.
 
 The officer on special duty at Pamba, Jayadev G, IPS, said arrangements have been made with the KSRTC for 400 vehicles to transport pilgrims returning after the Makaravilakku to Nilakkal. During the peak hour-between 7pm and 9.30pm-KSRTC buses would get priority on this route and private vehicles would not be allowed.
 
 Police, KSRTC, KSEB, revenue, and the devaswom board officials are holding regular meetings to ensure a better pilgrimage.
