MUMBAI: The prospect of Test cricket becoming shorter by a day may still be far away, but a step may just have been taken in that direction. On Wednesday night, Cricket   ( ), while announcing the itinerary for the forthcoming tour of India, came out with a decision which may change the face of the game's longer version.

 To compensate for India's absence for the   Test (which is traditionally held from Dec 26), South Africa will now play a four-day Test under lights against Zimbabwe. “To ensure that we do not disappoint our loyal fans over the traditional Boxing Day period and to take advantage of our brand new lights at St George's Park, we will host   in the first ever four-day day-night Test match to be played. The Test status of the match is subject to the approval of the International Cricket Council (ICC),” CSA chief   said in a news release.
 
 “The extensive revamping of our international grounds are on schedule and the day-night Test match promises to be a world-class experience for the players and fans,” he added. The question is, will the ICC grant official status to a four-day Test? “This has been an ongoing conversation, and there is a growing support for four-day Tests to be trialled. This will now come up for further discussion at the ICC chief executives' committee and the ICC board at the upcoming ICC committee meetings in Auckland (Oct 9-13), following which the decision will be made,” a source told TOI on Thursday.
 
 The BCCI, however, isn't exactly enthused with the idea. “We've been batting for five-day Tests in the ICC meetings for a while now. I don't think that this match will, or should be accorded official status,” said a top Board official.
 
 There is, however, a growing clamour for four-day Tests, as a means to saving the longest and most traditional format of the game, in the face of stiff competition from T20 leagues around the world.
