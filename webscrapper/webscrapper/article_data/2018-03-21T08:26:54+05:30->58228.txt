GANDHINAGAR: Ishwar Parmar, the social justice and empowerment minister, in a written response to a starred question by dalit activist and Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani, on Tuesday told the assembly on Tuesday that the state government has no plans to give land to the Dalit victims of the  

 Mevani had asked, “Is this fact that in July 2016 the then CM, while visiting the Dalit victims of Mota-Samadhiyala in Una, promised to give them 5 acres of land or jobs? If yes, then is it true that according to the status on 31-01-2018, these promises have not been fulfilled yet, if yes when will these promises be fulfilled?”
 
 In reply Parmar, said, “There is no such information on record, so the questions do not arise.”
 
 Mevani, reacting to the social justice minister’s reply, said, “The reply shows the insensitive and anti-Dalit mindset of the   government. His predecessor   was also from his party and she publicly, before news channels and hundreds of people on camera, made a promise to the victims 5 acres of land and jobs and toilets in all houses of the village. Till date, nothing has been given to them while the government gives lakhs of acres to corporate giants. The government could at least have given them class IV peon jobs. I went to 19 states across the country and people all over India want justice for the Una Dalit victims. The Gujarat BJP government’s response in the state assembly is totally disappointing and I support the victims’ decision to convert to other religion in protest against the Gujarat government.”
 
 Balu Sarvaiya, the father of two of the  , said not a single promise made by the then CM was fulfilled. 
 
 “Anandiben promised us a pucca house, five acres of agricultural land and jobs to my kids. She had also promised that our case would be conducted in a fast track court and the entire legal procedure would be finished in 90 days. Not a single promise has been fulfilled by the Gujarat government,” Sarvaiya said.
