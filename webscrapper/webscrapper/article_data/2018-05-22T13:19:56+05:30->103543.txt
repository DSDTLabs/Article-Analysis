PATNA: Fifteen parks located in   and   localities will soon get open gyms and separate children zones.

 
 “We are in the process of developing a detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed open gyms and children zones in 15 parks. Construction work is likely to begin in October after the monsoon season ends,” Patna’s divisional forest officer   said on Monday and added the proposed facilities would be ready by next year.
 
 As of now, no entry fee has been finalized. “The 15 parks are located in residential areas. Asking for entry fees does not seem feasible,” Patil told this reporter.
 
 According to sources, Patna has altogether 70 parks. The newly created Patna park division, which is responsible for development of parks along with the beautification and landscaping of roads in the   area, has acquired 44 parks for maintenance. It will take over the remaining 26 parks by next month.
 
 “Earlier, the parks were under various departments that were unable to carry out proper maintenance of the park as per standard operating procedures as they had little knowledge of horticulture or forestry. Besides, there was no availability of drinking water facilities and lights,” Patil said, adding proper water supply would be ensured in the parks.
 
 Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi had recently directed the divisional forest officer to conduct plantation drives in all the parks while   (law and order) was asked to remove encroachments from city parks.
