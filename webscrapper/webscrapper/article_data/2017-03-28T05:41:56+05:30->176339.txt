CHANDIGARH: The   (CAT) has directed the UT administration to recast its seniority list and ensure there is no reservation in promotions until the administration carries out an exercise for understanding the “backwardness” of the caste of staffers under consideration. 

 The tribunal passed the order this week, on a petition by   who had approached the tribunal over out-of-turn promotions for two staffers under reservation. In the order, made public on Monday, the CAT also set aside promotion orders passed by the administration in 2015 for elevation of clerks to the post of senior assistants. It also said candidates from reserved categories had been awarded promotion as opposed to those who had more experience. This order is expected to affect many in the UT administration.
 
 Advocate R K Sharma, who represented the petitioners before the tribunal, said the administration’s orders were against   directions which barred reservation in promotions. The CAT directed that there would be no reservation in promotions until the UT administration carries out a “three-tier exercise”, under which it would to collect quantifiable data depicting the backwardness of class of the staffer, inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment, and compliance with Article 335 in the promotion. “The   in promotions in the instant case on the basis of this report is unacceptable and is rejected forthwith. The prayer of the applicants is allowed,” the tribunal’s order read. “ The orders dated September 29, 2015, passed by UT administration to the extent the private respondents (Jai Karan, Chandigarh, Superintendent Grade-II, Home Department, Ramesh, Senior Assistant,   and Promila, senior assistant, UT home department) been promoted as senior assistants, is quashed. The UT is directed to finalize the tentative seniority list dated August 9, 2010, by following the catch-up rule and other instructions in the relevant behalf within two month.”
