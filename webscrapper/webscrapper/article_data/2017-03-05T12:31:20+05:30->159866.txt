BENGALURU: Pulse-pounding races, a record prize money of Rs 5.5 crore - unprecedented in the history of   - followed by an array of entertainment will add a special touch to the the   races at the   on Sunday.

 Running for the Rs 1.55-crore Indian Turf Invitation Cup - Sunday’s feature event - will be a dozen Grade I horses and the one that stands out from the pack is  .
 
 The filly - coached by champion trainer   and to be ridden by champion jockey   - towers over her rivals on form after a series of blazing victories in the run-up to the big event. Barring the Gitanjali Indian 1000 Guineas (Gr 1), where she finished second two months ago, Hall Of Famer has won five races, securing three places in her eight starts.
 
 But what makes her the hot favourite for the 2400m race is that she comes into the contest after winning two straight Derbys in Kolkata (Calcutta Derby Stakes (Gr 1) and Mumbai (The Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby Gr 1) in the last two months.
 
 One factor, which could prove to be a minor hindrance is that Hall of Famer has travelled over 9,000km across the country since October. But Padmanabhan is confident that his filly is in good shape.
 
 "She has done exceptionally well in the last four months. She went to Hyderabad, Mysuru, Mumbai, Kolkata and came back to Bengaluru before travelling to Mumbai again. Wherever she has travelled, she has performed well. Of course, too much of travelling would be a problem but the filly seems to have taken it in her stride. She is still looking fresh, which is a good sign," said Padmanabhan, who will be aiming for his sixth Turf Invitation Cup victory.
 
 Among the others who will challenge Hall of Famer are jockey-turned trainer Pesi Shroff's Temerity and   winner Tororosso from Irfan Ghatala's stable.
 
 "Our main competitors are Temerity, Tororosso and Winter Renaissance. Winter Renaissance, who finished fourth in the Indian Derby, has been improving and will turn out to be a possible threat for us. Tororosso won the Derby in only his third race. He has not travelled anywhere so he could also be a possible threat," Padmanabhan said.
 
 Temerity, to be ridden by Neeraj Rawal, has five wins to her credit from eight starts and a third place at the Indian Derby last month. The four-year-old, who had flopped despite being the favourite in the Indian 1000 Guineas last month, made amends by winning the Grade 1 Villoo Poonawalla Indian Oaks in Mumbai. Shroff felt the Mumbai challenger has to quickly acclimatise to the conditions here.
 
 Tororosso, meanwhile, could turn out to be a surprise package like it did in the Bengaluru Derby in January. The colt, who did not even figure among the contenders, stunned many with a sparkling gallop to win the derby riches in only his fourth run. He proved his credentials in the 2400m race but his weakness appears to be his temperament. "Tororosso has a clear chance to win the Cup. He has not run any race other than the mock run after his Derby win. But his temperament is an issue," said Ghatala.
 
 The Invitation weekend began on Saturday with the Dr MAM Ramaswamy Chettiar of Chettinad Memorial Stayers’ Cup (3,000m) and The Mysore Race Club Sprinters’ Cup (1,200m) being the two feature races. The Suleiman Attaollahi-trained Captain Morgan won the Stayers Cup while Pesi Shroff's Adam clinched the Sprinters’ Cup.
