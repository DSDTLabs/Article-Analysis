Surat: As maximum daytime temperature touched 41.4 degrees with relative humidity at 26% on Monday, Surat city experienced one of the hottest days of March as heat wave condition prevailed over the state. Monday’s maximum temperature was five degree above normal, said weather department officials.

 The weather department has predicted that for the next two days mercury is likely to be over 40 degree. If humidity remains below 30% and wind speed is not above 10 km per hour, Surtis are in for some hot days ahead.
 
 New Civil Hospital ( ) recorded about 100 cases heat related cases where patients complained of severe headache and fever. Though   (SMC)-run SMIMER and other primary health centres have not furnished any specific data, officials say the number of heat stroke patients is likely to go up in days to come. 
 
 Not only humans, but birds and animals too are reeling under the hot weather. In last two days, Prayas, an NGO working for birds and animals recorded more than 176 rescue calls. 
 
  of Prayas said, “Along with birds and domesticated animals suffering from heat, we are receiving calls for snakes coming out of their burrows due to hot weather.” 
 
 Till now seven birds have died due to heat related cases. “Some birds fall during flight and then are unable to move. Some birds are so weak that they can’t even move. Majority of the complaints are of dehydration,” said Desai. 
 
 Following the heat wave some schools issued advisory for parents not to let their children out of their homes between 1 and 5 pm.
 
 Dr  , executive director of   (UHCRC ) said, “In such situation it is necessary for us to make each and every citizen aware of what is happening.”
 
 “Keeping children, vulnerable people like those with chronic diseases like diabetes and others safe from heat should be priority. Like rains and floods disaster, we don’t have preparedness for heat wave and that could be costly in long term,” added Dr Desai.
