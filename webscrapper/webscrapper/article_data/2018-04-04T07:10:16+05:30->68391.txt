NEW DELHI: The   official responsible for coordinating with schools around   has been called for questioning by the   after it was found that someone had allegedly issued orders to release the papers from the bank before the usual time, after which the paper was leaked. Cops suspect that the Class X mathematics paper too might have been leaked in a similar manner with the connivance of some school teachers. 

 Cops probing the case suspect that even though the mathematics paper was leaked and circulated on WhatsApp groups, students could not have benefitted much from the leaked paper as there was not enough time for them to go through the paper.
 
  Sources said that the handwriting of the two teachers of Mother   in Bawana and the tuition teacher is being analysed to find out the whether they match with photographs of the hand-written questions from the Class X mathematics paper and some other papers that were rumoured to being circulated before exams. 
 
 Cops are also scanning footage at some   branches where the papers were stored to find out about unauthorised entries in the strong rooms. The school principal told the cops that he was unaware of the paper leaks from his school and could not explain how the papers had reached the school premises ahead of time.
