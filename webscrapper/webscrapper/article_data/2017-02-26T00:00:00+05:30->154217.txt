Refurbish your   closet to look comfortably  !

 
 Blur any difference between slouchy and ladylike by mixing signature tomboy aesthetic with feminine details in sturdy fabrics. For instance, divide your baggy denims into detachable garter and chap-like legs or transform a loose, extra-large pair into buttoned-up capris.
 
 
 
 Denim is easy-to-wear as a dress. Go for a tube dress and wear it with a shirt, sneakers and a high ponytail.
 
 
 
 Mix toned-down metallics and shimmer with denims. Or mix denims, cotton lace with winter materials like fur.
 
 
  
  
 
 Popular in the ’60s and ’70s, patchwork denim is back as a major street style. From contrast panels placed creatively along the back pockets or right above and below the knees to jeans with colourful chunks of stitched pieces – update an old pair. 
  
 
 
 Bring together the two biggest trends of 2017 – cold shoulder and denim. A well-fitted cold-shoulder denim shirt is both flirty and feminine. Style with a denim belt or wear over a lace bralet.
 
 
 
 Slit-hem bootcut jeans is the one must-have denim piece for 2017. Bootcut looks fabulous with tailored items like button-down shirts, blazers and coats. When the weather warms up, pair them with a basic T-shirt.
 
 
 
 
 Play with different colours, like pair white denims with blue. Or go tonal in your pairing – dark-denim jeans with a lighter top
 
 
 
 
 
 1. Go for pockets that sit high and tilt slightly outward to make your butt appear lifted.
 
 2. Pick the right pair of sleek-cut black/dark blue jeans for a casual Friday work look.
 
 3. Choose edgy accessories like pointy pumps in nude or metallics, and statement cuffs or necklaces.
 
 4. Cuffed denims look laid-back. For loose-fitting, wide-leg jeans, go for a thick cuff. For skinny jeans, opt for mini cuff. The cuff bottom should hit just at or above the ankle.
