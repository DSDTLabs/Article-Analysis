Panaji: The revival of the monsoon will bring cheer to those intending to try whitewater rafting in the state.

 With heavy rainfall over the last 48 hours rejuvenating the waters of the Mhadei river, Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GDTC) has announced that it will resume whitewater rafting activities from Thursday.
 
 GTDC officials say the rise in the Mhadei’s water level will be conducive for rafting activities for at least the next 10 days, or until the Dussehra holidays. The corporation expects a large influx of tourists to the state for Navratri and Dussehra celebrations, followed by the extended weekend until October 2.
 
 According to GTDC officials, rafting activity will operate as usual with two trips a day: the first at 9.30am and the second at 2.30pm. Bookings can be done through the regular channels.
 
 “The resumption of whitewater rafting will increase the number of guests. We expect much higher figures than last year,” a senior official at GTDC said.
 
 Rafting activity had taken a dip on account of a change in weather and the subsequent drop in water levels in the Mhadei river. “Tourists have got one more opportunity to enjoy the adventure activity during this monsoon,” the official added.
 
 Goans and tourists who wish to experience whitewater rafting will have to assemble at The Earthen Pot Restaurant, Sayed Nagar, Valpoi, Sattari, from where a 25-minute drive and a 10-minute walk into the Mhadei valley will lead to the rafting site.
