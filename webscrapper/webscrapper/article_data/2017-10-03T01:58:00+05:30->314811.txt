RAIPUR: Playback singer Udit Narayan’s son  , a TV anchor, singer and actor himself, has been caught on camera threatening an airline employee during a row over the fees for excess baggage.

 The episode occurred on Monday in  . In the video, which has since gone viral, Aditya is heard telling the airline staffer: “Teri chaddi nahin utari na maine, toh mera naam   nahin (If I don’t unclothe you, my name is not Aditya Narayan).” However, the airline, IndiGo, ensured Aditya paid almost the entire Rs 13,000 fees — making him pay Rs 12,900. He was given the boarding pass only after he apologised. “Aditya Narayan apologised to the ground staff and thereafter was given the boarding pass. We cannot compromise the dignity of our staff or passengers,” Indigo spokesperson Ajay Jasra said in a statement.
 
 Aditya was in Raipur to perform at a Dussehra event, and was taking a flight back to Mumbai. “He was travelling with a group of five people, carrying excess baggage. The amount to be paid for the excess baggage came to Rs 13,000. He refused to pay the female check-in staffer, and said he would not pay more than Rs 10,000,” said the statement. IndiGo said Aditya, 30, used “unparliamentary language” with the woman employee.
 
 It added in its statement, “Besides... he pointed a finger at the duty manager and again used profanity. When he was politely asked to not use such language... he started shouting even loudly and used abusive words.”
 
 However, the tantrum won’t land Aditya on the nofly list, since the unruly behaviour happened at the airport before he boarded the aircraft.
