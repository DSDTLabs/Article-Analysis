SURAT: Union minister of state for textiles   was ghearaoed by around 200 weavers and embroidery unit owners, who were protesting over non-payment of subsidy amount under   (TUFS) here on Saturday.

 Tamta was in the city to participate in the nation-wide launch of the package for powerloom sector under   scheme of the Government of India. Union textiles minister Smriti Irani launched the scheme from Bhiwandi through video conferencing, which connected major textile manufacturing centres across the country, including Surat. 
 
 A group of weavers approached Tamta after the programme ended at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University’s (VNSGU) convention hall. The weavers were demanding that the textiles ministry should immediately release the subsidy amount due to more than 500 weavers. According to the weavers, over Rs150 crore worth of subsidy amount is yet to be released from the last two years. 
 
 Dipak Sheta, a weaver, said, “We have invested huge amount to take benefit under the TUFS and were dependent on the subsidy amount. Yet, the government has not released the subsidy amount since two years now. I have invested Rs50 lakh.”
 
 Tamta assured that his department will certainly look into the issue and try to release the subsidy amount as soon as possible. “We can have a one-to-one discussion on this. The ministry is committed to resolving the subsidy issue at the earliest,” Tamta said.
