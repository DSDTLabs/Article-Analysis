NAGPUR: Deceit, conspiracy,   and a suicide, all were woven together in a confusing   ‘Yatna’ staged at the 64th Natya Mahotsav primary competition organized at Kamgar Kalyan Bhavan, Raje Raghuji Nagar, on Wednesday. 

 The story is about a married couple.  , played by Ashok Dhande, is a businessman whose wife   (Arti Bansod) has no attachment towards him. Taking advantage of this, Kamlakar’s rival   (Ashok Deshmukh), makes Tarabai fall in his love trap.
 
 Nageshwar is guided by Kalu Mama (Urkuda Gondhle). Nageshwar cuts Kamlakar’s fingers while Mama blackmails Tarabai to grab her husband’s property. Tarabai forces Kamlakar to sign (without fingers!) the papers. She later learns that Nageshwar has made a pawn of her. Then there is Nageshwar’s girlfriend Rohini (Sharda Shivankar) too. 
 
 Tarabai returns to Kamlakar who refuses to accept her. Tarabai then consumes poison and dies. 
 
 The story also has characters like Rakesh, Tarabai’s brother, and his girlfriend Nikita whose brother Moru tries to sell her to Nageshwar but Rakesh saves her. These subplots drag the drama. 
 
 Parvir Chamat is director and Ishwar Dhakate is writer of the play staged by Kamgar Kalyan Kendra, Sakoli.
