AHMEDABAD: The graduating batch of Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) in the   ( ) presents an example of gender equity with eight boys and an equal number of girls completing the course this year.

 The increase in the ratio of female-male graduates to 50:50 in 2018 batch from 25:75 in 2017 and less than 10%   in 2016 signals a shift towards equal progress and development of both women and men.
 
 Professor  , chairperson, FPM at the IIM-A, said, “The gender balance in the graduating class indicates women numbers are rising faster than men in acquiring high levels of specialization in management education at IIM-A.”
 
 Biswajita Parida, a student of FPM (marketing), said, “Researches indicate that significant differences exist between male and female brains in terms of information processing, learning, dealing with emotions, perception, memory, and multi-tasking abilities. Therefore, male and female minds need to equally participate and brainstorm together to bring about wholesome yield which have implications for the mass.”
 
 According to P K V Kishan, a student of FPM (economics), a balanced ratio at both enrolment and graduation will help improve the intrinsic value of each gender. “This is a recognition of the fact that fate of the hitherto under-represented gender no longer lies with circumstances,” Kishan added.
