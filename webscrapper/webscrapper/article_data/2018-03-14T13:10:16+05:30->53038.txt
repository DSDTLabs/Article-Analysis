PANAJI: With a 15-lakh population and thousands of tourists generating an average of 600 tonnes of waste per day, the government has a mountain (of waste) to climb. It doesn’t help that most of the citizens and local self-governing bodies do not cooperate in keeping the state clean, either.
 
 The commissioning of the   management plant at   in May 2016 was considered a milestone for the state, but the coastal panchayats of  , which were sought to be brought under its ambit, were slow in responding.
 
 After the   (GWMC) started functioning from August 1, 2017, more panchayats have joined the Swachch Bharat bandwagon, doubling the waste received at Saligao from 51.2 tonnes in January 2017 to 113.3 tonnes in January 2018, though a part of it is mixed waste. “It is a work in progress,” said   managing director  .
 
 The government has promised more funds and incentives to panchayats excelling in contributing to the segregated garbage collection system. However, garbage managers are critical that the administration is shying away from cracking the whip against manufacturers, suppliers and users of one-time-use plastic or material below 50 microns.
 
 With less than two years left to fulfill the “garbage-free Goa” mission, the GWMC is gearing up to enforce a ban on plastic from May 30. But activists said that as long as implementation of rules against littering, burning of waste and dumping in water bodies are ineffective, the mission will remain a distant dream.
 
 The GWMC is also preparing to flood the market with cloth bags, hoping that if they are aggressively promoted, their use will help push plastic carrybags off the shelf.
