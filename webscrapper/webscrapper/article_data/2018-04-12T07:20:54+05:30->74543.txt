LUCKNOW: The already narrow lanes of Faizabad Road left for traffic movement with the ongoing   construction have further shrunk these days in space.   ( ) parks its heavy construction vehicles and machinery on the road sides, leaving very little space for commuters, especially around   crossing.

 The crossing has a busy railway station on one side and a Metro station is being constructed on the other.
 
 This makes the lane too congested for commuters from Indiranagar and Gomtinagar going towards Nishatganj. Amid all this, parking of giant cement mixing plants, cranes and trucks of construction material along Nishatganj flyover and Faizabad Road make the situation worse as people daily struggle to get out of the stretch.
 
 Sushil Verma, a commuter, said, “It requires a good 30 minutes to cross this stretch during heavy traffic. Traffic from all directions, Polytechnic, Indiranagar and Mahanagar merges at Badshahnagar to reach Nishatganj but poor traffic management leads to long jams often.”
 
 LMRC has not deployed enough marshals to streamline traffic. One sees marshals at a few intersections infrequently.
 
 Shruti Seth, a student, pointed out that since Badshahnagar also forms the approach route to a few schools nearby, students face trouble crossing this stretch because of cars and bikes rushing through.
 
 Pedestrians, cyclists and rickshaw-pullers are at risk as the congested lane suddenly bifurcates: towards the flyover and below the flyover.
 
 There is more chaos as traffic from Mahanagar takes the wrong side to access the flyover directly.
 
 LMRC’s chief project manager   said, “It is a tough challenge to complete Metro construction in such limited space. We have no option but to park vehicles along the construction site or flyover but we can definitely ensure that enough marshals are deployed every day to steer traffic. We will also try to reduce the parking duration of vehicles near the construction area.”
