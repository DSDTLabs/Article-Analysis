MUMBAI: It does not look like the tussle between south Mumbai's Bombay   and   will end any time soon. A week after BMC put up a notice board on the ground opposite the gymkhana stating that the space is open for public use, the club authorities on Friday shot off a letter to the civic body, claiming that the message on the display board is incomplete and misleading.

 After receiving the letter, BMC has written to the collector seeking clarification. BMC placed the notice board on the ground on May 5 in Marathi stating that the space is open to use for the common public and citizens could use this ground for sporting activities. This was even as the gymkhana had already put a board in English stating that the ground is open for public use when not in the use by members of the club.
 
 The club authorities have, in their May 11 letter to BMC and the collector, stated that the text on the civic body's notice board, which has been put up on the periphery of the ground leased to Bombay gymkhana, is incomplete and misleading.According to the letter, the board should indicate the provisions of clause 2 (h) of the lease deed relating to use of the ground by the public. Clause 2 (h) states “...the lessee will not exclude the public from the demised land when not in the actual use of the members of the gymkhana for the playing of games or for athletic sports or functions in connection therewith and will not put any fence or structure whatsoever around the demised land except a light and a movable rope fence to enclose the turf and watered cricket pitches from which the public may always be expired“.The club has asked BMC to take down the aforesaid notice bo ard andor clarify to them the contents of the same to reflect the factual position of clause 2 (h) of the lease deed.
 
 Assistant municipal commissioner (A ward)   said, “Since the (99-year) lease agreement was with the collector and has expired, we want to clarify if the lease conditions still apply .“
