Bihaan tells Tina that he will marry Sankara because she wants him to. Thapki and Bani stand away crying. Bani then goes to Tina's room and asks her about why she took Sankara's name when she also wants Thapki to be her mother. Bani tells her that she will never talk to her and leaves.
 
  Thapki comes in and asks Tina to stop crying. She hugs her and asks her to tell the truth if something is wrong. She is about to take Shraddha's name when she enters the room. Tina gets scared.
  
  Shraddha asks Tina to tell everybody again that she wants Sankara to be her mother. Tina recalls Shraddha hurting her and so agrees with her.
  
  Thapki gets a feeling that it is Shraddha who has scared Tina.
  
  All the kids go for a ride. Shraddha then tells Tina to go alone once. She removes the nuts from the swing so that Tina falls down. The swing starts fast and Tina hangs in the air. Everyone stands shocked.
