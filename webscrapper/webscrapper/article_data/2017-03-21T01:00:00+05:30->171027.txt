Two different people. Two different generations. Two different perspectives on life. One look at 42-year-old Mukhi ( ) and 21-year-old Aru ( ) and you know they are poles apart. But tonight when they meet for the first time in 'Yeh Moh Moh Ke Dhaage', these very differences will lay the foundation for an unusual relationship. A bond that is undefined and never seen before on Indian television. 
The show will bring alive the vibrancy of Gujarat. From the bylanes of Ahmedabad to the majestic   of Kutch and the splendid colours — the look and feel of the show promises to be a delight. 
 
 Eijaz, who will play mukhiya  , says, “Every actor reaches a stage where he wants a life-altering role. Mukhi is that character for me. This role has been challenging as an actor and I hope my fans grow to love him as much as I have.” 
 
 Saba Mumtaz, writer and producer, says, “'Yeh Moh Moh Ke Dhaage' is an ode to that endearing phenomena of ‘unusual love’. It’s my tribute to all those relationship stories we come across, but never understand. I want to shout out loud to everyone to come see this likeable love story of a very unlikely couple.”
