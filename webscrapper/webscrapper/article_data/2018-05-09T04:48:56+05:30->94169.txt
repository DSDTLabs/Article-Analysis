MUMBAI: Displaced around three decades ago from their soil to accommodate a dam project in Palghar district, tribals from two hamlets are gearing up to fight another battle, this time the bullet train. 

 The Right Of Way (ROW) survey for the project will begin in Palghar from Wednesday. The two villages, Hanuman Nagar in Palghar taluka and Chandra Nagar in Dahanu taluka, are among 108 villages in   from where the bullet train will pass. 
 
 These two are the only villages in the state occupied by project-affected people (PAPs) and from where the bullet train will pass.
 
 The villages were created to accommodate PAPs of the Surya Dam project constructed in 1990 over Kawdas and Dhamni rivers in Dahanu's Kasa taluka. The villagers were shifted to Chandra Nagar and Hanuman Nagar in the late 80s. Both villages are located at a distance of around 5km and are 8 to 10 km away from the railway line.
 
 Fearing another displacement, both villages comprising over 700 houses have decided to oppose land acquisition.
