For an actor, it’s sometimes as difficult to get into the skin of the character as it is to bid adieu to the part after completing the film.  , who has played a range of characters — from serial killers and roadside romeos to bungling reporters — says, “Some of the characters I have played are so dark that they might not seem real. Their thought and philosophy might not match mine, but I still have to essay the roles to perfection. A dark character takes a lot out of you, which you may not realise then. But later, you think, ‘Yaar, mere paas toh khud ke emotions hi nahin bache’.”

 So, how does he let go of the dark characters that he has played? Nawaz replies, “I go back to my village, where I have land, and till the soil. That helps me stay sane. For example, my character in '  2.0' was that of a cold-blooded murderer and bringing it to life drained me completely. After completing the film, I went back to my village where they were farming sarson (mustard). So, I drove the truck, worked in the fields and felt normal. This exercise unwinds me and takes me back to my roots.”
 
 Ask him if people in his native town express shock over a celebrity taking to farming and he replies, “They behave normally with me after two days. When I do physical labour in the hot sun, all the stardom sweats out. That is when I feel at peace.”
