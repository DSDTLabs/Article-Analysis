 Singh is survived by his wife Neelam Kumari, the spokesman said, adding that he was a brave and sincere soldier. "The nation will always remain indebted to him for the supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty", he said.
 
 The spokesman said the mortal remains of the soldier had reached his home for last rites and he will be given a farewell with full military honours later in the day.
