 director Omar Lulu's next film Chunkzz promises to be a fun ride, with its premise revolving around a group of engineering students and their trip to Goa. 

 While Balu Varghese, Dharmajan Bolgatty, Vishak Nair and Ganapathi play the heroes in the movie,   and Mareena Michael have now been finalised as its female protagonists.
 
 'Both Honey and Mareena will be seen as tomboys. They are a daring and mischievous pair,' says the director. Honey plays a character named Riya, who is a troublemaker of sorts. 'Wherever she goes she manages to create a trouble. In the film, she is kicked out of her college in Bangalore. Her parents, who get fed up of her pranks, makes her join an engineering college near their home in Kerala,' says Omar, adding that that's how she ends up enrolling as the only girl student in the mechanical engineering stream in the college.
 Meanwhile, Mareena's character Sherin is from Bangalore. 'She's a DJ who is very modern, trendy and outgoing,' says the filmmaker. The movie's plot evolves as the girls join the gang of boys on a trip.
