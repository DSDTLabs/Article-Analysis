TIRUPUR: The state government has finally released an additional compensation of Rs 10.3 crore to the drought-hit   growers of the district.

 The   government had earlier announced a drought relief package of Rs 83 crore for the farmers of the district. But the coconut growers pitched for a separate relief package for them, saying the compensation announced was not adequate as many coconut trees were affected due to poor rainfall.
 
 Following this, the district administration formed a special expert committee to study the ground realty. The committee inspected all the coconut farms across the district and submitted as report to the district administration, which then sought additional drought relief from the government.
 
 Now that the government has sanctioned the additional compensation, collector   has taken steps to distribute Rs 10.3 crore among 6,059 farmers in   south, Uthukuli, Palladam, Avinashi, Dharapuram,   and Madathukulam taluks, said a senior agricultural department official.
 
 “We have started releasing the additional drought relief to the farmers,” the official said.
 
 A Paramasivam, a farmer from Udumalpet, however, said the compensation won’t be still adequate. “Many coconut trees have been dried up. Though the district received a decent rainfall before the start of southwest monsoon, it hasn’t benefitted the coconut trees much. Rugose spirally whiteflies have also damaged the trees in Udumalpet and Maduthukulam taluk,” he added.
