GURUGRAM: Four cops were arrested on Friday for negligence and conspiracy after a lifeterm  , sentenced in a case of “kidnapping in order to murder”, escaped from custody in the early hours when he was being brought back to Bhondsi jail from Rohtak.

 Rajesh Kumar had gone to Maharshi Dayanand University (Rohtak) to appear for an LLB examination on Thursday, police said. Four cops — head constable Balbir Singh, constables Sandeep, Rammehar and Jasbir — had accompanied Rajesh.
 
 A preliminary probe revealed Rajesh’s brother Rakesh Singh who is a jail official at Sunaria (Rohtak) had arranged for a car along with a driver for the trip and the convict used the same vehicle to give the cops the slip and flee around 1.30am.
 
 Police said on the way back, two of the four cops got off near the police lines. Later, when they reached near Bhondsi jail, Rajesh said he wanted to relieve himself. As the car stopped in a deserted area and the two cops came out, he pushed them aside and fled with the handcuffs in the same car.
 
 Based on the complaint filed by ASI Charan Singh, who later found the four cops stranded on   during patrolling, an FIR has been filed under sections 223 (escape from custody due to negligence by public servant), 224 (resistance by a person to his lawful apprehension), 225A (sufferance of escape on part of public servant) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at   police station.
 
 While the four cops have already been arrested, police are probing the role of Rajesh’s brother Rakesh in the conspiracy and may arrest him too. “It is a matter of grave negligence. We are questioning the four cops and they will be produced in court on Saturday,” said inspector Vishnu Prasad, SHO, Badshapur.
