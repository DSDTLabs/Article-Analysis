GURUGRAM: Police have identified all the four   smugglers who had entered the   base in Manesar on Monday night and exchanged fire with the guards inside the  . Gurugram police   visited the base on Wednesday and assured NSG authorities that the infiltrators were mere cattle   who had scaled the perimeter wall to take refuge inside the high-security zone while fleeing from a chasing police team and gau rakshaks. He also suggested to NSG officials to increase the height of the boundary wall to avoid such incidents in the future.

 “I visited the NSG base to attend a seminar there and later I went to the spot (where the shooting took place). The boundary wall on that side of the NSG campus is low and I suggested that it be raised, during my discussions with NSG officials. We have identified all the suspects, who were only cattle smugglers. Our teams are conducting raids and all of them will be arrested soon,” said Sandeep Khirwar, police commissioner.
 
 An investigating officer told TOI three special teams — one comprising crime unit officers and the other two comprising cops from Kherki Daula and Manesar police stations — have been formed to nab the suspects as well as the owner of the van that they used to transport a cow. “The van’s owner has been identified as Sahun, a native of Ghasera village in Nuh district. He is currently on the run,” he said.
 
 The incident had triggered a security breach at the NSG campus in Manesar late on Monday night as the alleged cattle smugglers not only entered the premises but also fired a few shots at the guards. Though they were soon met with retaliatory firing, the four managed to evade capture as they sneaked out by jumping out of the perimeter wall.
 
 For over two hours, NSG commandos and the police team had carried out a combing operation in the village and its nearby forest areas, but could not track the four men down. Police later seized the pick-up van and sent the cow to an animal shelter.
