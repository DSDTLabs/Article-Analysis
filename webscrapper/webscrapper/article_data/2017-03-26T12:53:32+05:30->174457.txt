 COO   announced the release of her  , ' : Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy' recently.
 
 Her last book, ' ', on women,  , business leadership and development, sold over a million copies and was on the top of the bestseller lists and she was named one of the 100 most influential women of the year 2012 by Time Magazine. Not surprising as she was the first woman to work on the Facebook Board.
  
 Her upcoming book 'Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy' speaks on how she found meaning and happiness after the sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg, in 2015. On a Facebook post, she told how the book's title was inspired by a conversation she had with a friend.
  
 "A few weeks after my husband Dave died, I was talking to my friend Phil Deutch about a father-son activity that Dave was not here to do. We came up with a plan for someone to fill in so my son would not have to miss out. I cried, 'But I want Dave.' Phil put his arm around me and said, 'Option A is not available. So let's just kick the shit out of Option B,'" Sandberg's Facebook post read.
 
 "That became my mantra, and for the past two years I've tried hard to find meaning and happiness in the wake of our despair...Because no one's life is perfect, we all live some form of Option B. It's my deepest hope that Option B will help others learn what I learned: that when life pulls you under, you can kick against the bottom, break the surface, and breathe again," she further wrote. 
  
 'Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy', has been co-written with Adam Grant and would be released on April 24, 2017.
