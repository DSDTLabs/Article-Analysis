WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a crawling  , that may help understand how dirt and germs on the floor affect human infants in the first year of their life.

 The research showed that when babies crawl, their movement across floors, especially carpeted surfaces, kicks up high levels of dirt, skin cells, bacteria, pollen, and fungal spores. The infants inhale a dose of bio bits in their lungs that is four times what an adult would breathe. While this may sound alarming, scientists from   in US said this may not be a bad thing.
 
 “There are studies that have shown that being exposed to a high diversity and concentration of biological materials may reduce the prevalence of asthma and allergies later in life,” said  , assistant professor at Purdue University.
