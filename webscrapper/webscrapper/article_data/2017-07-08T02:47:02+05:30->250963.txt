NEW DELHI: Senior   members claimed on Friday that the FIR filed against three of its MLAs — Jarnail Singh, Somnath Bharti and Amanatullah Khan — for having allegedly roughed up a woman in the assembly was untenable. They said no action was taken when an AAP councillor was allegedly manhandled by BJP councillors during a mock session of the corporations in Ramlila Maidan in June 2016. 

 Senior member Saurabh Bharadwaj said that in the   of councillor Rakesh Kumar,   had refused to file an FIR, saying the mayor needed to sanction the action as the incident took place during a House meeting. “How come Ramlila Maidan was treated as a House whereas the police have shown great alacrity in registering a case on an incident that allegedly took place inside the assembly? Did they seek the speaker’s permission?” 
 
 The party claimed that the complainant entered the House on the pretext of meeting opposition leader Vijender Gupta on a pass made by his office on June 28. “However, Gupta was not present and she entered the visitors’ gallery without a valid pass. The next day, she again entered   by posing as a driver of suspended AAP MLA Kapil Mishra,” Bharadwaj said.
 
 Gupta, however, has denied any hand in this episode. “Anyone who wants to meet us is given a pass to come up till my room. It is the assembly security’s responsibility to ensure that people don’t roam around. What action has been taken against those who authorised entry of two others who shouted slogans against an AAP minister on the same day?” said Gupta.
 
 AAP also asked Delhi Police when the complaint was filed and why they didn’t take the complainant to the nearest government hospital for an MLC.
