TIRUVANNAMALAI: A 20-year-old nurse was rescued from a marriage her family members forced her into by Triuvannamalai police based on a tip-off by Delhi-based NGO ' '.

 The NGO took the initiative to pull the girl out of the forced marriage after her lover got in touch with them for help.
 
 The youth, a Christian and the girl, a Hindu, were in a relationship and had been living together for over a year when her relatives allegedly abducted her three days ago, forcing her to marry her uncle. The youth then contacted the NGO for help, who in turn connected with the police. 
 
 “A youth from Tiruvannamalai contacted our helpline at about 10 am. But he was not able to communicate to us properly due to language barrier. He again contacted us with the help of his friend and explained the issue. He told us that his lover was abducted three days ago and held captive by her family members,” said Sanjoy Sachdev, chairman of the NGO.
 
 He added that they acted immediately and contacted the police officers in Tiruvannamalai. “The police officers did a commendable job and rescued the girl within a few hours,” he said.
 
 The police team traced the girl and reached her house in Thatchampattu village at about 5.30pm.
 
 “The girl was rescued. She is major and has the rights to marry the person she likes and no one can force her to marry against her wish. A woman police officer is inquiring in the girl and we will take appropriate action following the inquiry,” a police official told TOI.
