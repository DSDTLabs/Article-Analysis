GANDHINAGAR:  , political adviser to   president  , on Wednesday filed the nomination papers for a fifth term in Rajya Sabha from Gujarat even as  , who recently resigned as leader of the opposition in the state assembly, appeared determined to sabotage his re-election.

 Vaghela threatened that he would resign as Congress MLA to avoid voting for Patel in the Rajya Sabha poll on August 8 if   in charge of Gujarat   did not tender an apology for recently levelling allegations that he (Vaghela) had resigned from Congress “fearing the   and ED”.
 
 “I don’t fear ED or CBI, they can raid me 10 times but will not find anything. If Gehlot will not apologise, I will resign as MLA before the Rajya Sabha election to avoid voting for Ahmedbhai,” Vaghela said.
 
 The threat came even as Vaghela said he had promised Patel he would vote for him. “Ahmedbhai met me on Tuesday and offered to withdraw in case I wanted to contest RS elections. I declined his offer and assured he will get my vote,” said Vaghela.
 
 Already, there is uncertainty about Patel’s re-election given the cross-voting by a section of Congress MLAs in the presidential polls. 
 
 After filing his nomination, Patel expressed confidence that he will win. When quizzed about Vaghela, he said: “He is upset with the party. I met him yesterday and he promised he will vote for Congress. I have no reason to disbelieve him.”
