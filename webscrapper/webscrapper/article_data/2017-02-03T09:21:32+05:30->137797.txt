JAISALMER: The construction of a   on 400 bighas of pasture land in   under   of Barmer has been stopped after a bench of justice Raghvendra S Rathore and justice Satyawan Singh put a stay on this construction on January 25 and served notice to the   and   seeking reply. 

 Barmer District collector Sudhir Sharma in September 2016 ordered to allot 300 bighas in Pachpadra tehsil of Barmer for construction of sub grid station. As the sight is a regular destination for migratory birds including crane, flamingoes during winter, villagers had protested the decision saying the allotted area is a pasture land and also a catchment area of a lake. In a letter to the state government on November 9, 2016 villagers had stated that people from 24 villages fetch drinking   from this lake. 
 
 A case was also lodged in protest of the allotment of land to NGT Bhopal in December last year, but the district collector tried to convince them for supporting the construction by not becoming an obstacle. In reply, the villagers said that they donâ€™t want development at the cost of drinking water as people from 24 villages along with cattle are dependent on this lake for drinking water. The case was filed on December 12, 2016 in NGT which stopped the construction.
 
 Confirming this, collector Sharma said that NGT has stopped the proposed sub-station. NGT gave this order in the presence of advocates of the complainant and Barmer tehsildar Bhagidar Choudhary and advocate Rohit Sharma.
