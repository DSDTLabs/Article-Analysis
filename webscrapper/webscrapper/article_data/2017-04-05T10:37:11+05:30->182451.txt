HYDERABAD: The   on Tuesday directed the   (TTD) to not dole out any more funds to a private organisation,   (HDPT), in Tirupati floated by a retired bureaucrat.  's principal secretary (Revenue) issued a government order (Ms No 65) on February 8 asking the   to release 50 lakh to the trust every month. 

 The bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther was hearing a public interest petition filed by P Naveen Kumar Reddy of Chittoor district, who questioned the order and sought the intervention of the court. 
 
 His counsel P Suryanaryana Murthy told the court that the action of the state was contrary to the section 111 of the AP Charitable and Hindu Religious and Endowments Act, 1987. 
 
 The high court bench too wondered as to how the state can direct the TTD to release money this way. "Who are you to ask TTD to disburse funds? Don't disburse any further funds", the bench told the state revenue secretary. 
 
 "This is not a new phenomenon. Everybody feels TTD is part of the government," the acting CJ said. Upon a reply that they are releasing money after the state's GO, the bench told the TTD counsel: "TTD shall not release any funds to the trust".
