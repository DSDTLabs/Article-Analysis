The show premiered on the assurance that it came from the same pen that gave us the magnum opus, 'Baahubali'. Launched with a huge budget and a stellar starcast  's (whose last show was 'Reporters') 'Aarambh' is undergoing several changes in order to garner more eyeballs. While a few weeks back, the show changed its name, ('Aarambh' to '  -  '), now we now hear that the makers have also altered the entire storyline to impress viewers.
A source on strict conditions of anonymity said, "'Aarambh' will no longer be about the clash between two empires - Aryans and Dravidians - as it was earlier slated to be. The makers are now focussing on Devsena's story and how she will fight her way to become the queen. In addition, the show which will also move to a prime time slot to attract family audiences. Not just that, the makers will introduce an all new cast after the show takes a huge leap. Though   and Rajniesh Duggal will be a part of the show post the leap, their role will be comparatively less than it is now. The new cast will include Madhoo, Veebha Anand, Vaqar Sheikh,   Prasad Mukherjee, Arav Chowdhary and Nishant Tanwar."
