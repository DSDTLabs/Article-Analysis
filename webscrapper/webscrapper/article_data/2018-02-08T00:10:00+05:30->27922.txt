CHENNAI: The city   is all set to strike the right note at malls, parks and other public places in a bid to enhance the police department’s   among residents.

 Attired in red and blue, the band members, aged between 27 and 58, wield their trumpets, cornets, French horns, euphoniums and slide trombones with skill to play popular tunes as part of their mission. The band has acquired a new set of instruments from Bengaluru for a sum of Rs 2.86 lakh. 
 
 A circular issued by the director general of police T   has asked officials to arrange for the band to play once a week for about an hour, preferably on weekends, at places where members of the public gather. The endeavour would serve as an image-building exercise for the police, he said.
 
 The band has already been performing at beaches during the weekends to entertain the public who often shake a leg to show their appreciation. The show usually takes place from 6pm to 8pm but can be extended by popular demand. 
 
 A member of the band for more than 13 years, 57-year-old sub-inspector Murugan, who can play more than 50 instruments, says the band trains for two hours daily. 
 
 “Initially we play the song on a tape recorder and then jot down the musical notes to familiarise ourselves with the track,” he says.
 
 Chennai city police commissioner A K   says the move is aimed at showcasing the talent of the band and would also act as a stress buster for the public.
