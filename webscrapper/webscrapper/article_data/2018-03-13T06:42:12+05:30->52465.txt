NEW DELHI: Hours after being sent to jail by a CBI court,   Chidambaram’s lawyers got a crucial concession from the high court, which agreed to take up his bail plea in the INX Media case on Tuesday.

 With a special CBI court on Monday refusing to advance hearing of bail application from the already fixed date of March 15, his lawyers rushed to the HC and mentioned the urgency of the matter before a bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice C Hari Shankar. Just as the bench was rising for the day, senior advocates   and   brought up the refusal of the special court to hear Karti’s plea before March 15 and argued it violates rules framed by the HC. Krishnan maintained that the special court should have decided the bail plea since it was filed on March 5 and has been pending since then.
 
 
 The bench allowed the plea and directed that Karti’s bail be posted before a single judge as per the roster for Tuesday. It will be now heard by Justice Indermeet Kaur. The court had sent Karti to judicial custody till March 24 and said it would examine his bail on March 15.
