CHENNAI: A 75-year-old woman survived after slipping into a 50-foot-deep well at Koyambedu on Friday, thanks to a team of fire and rescue services personnel that battled for 45 minutes in the narrow shaft to rescue her. 

 A police officer said  , a widow who lived alone on  , Koyambedu, went to fetch water from her neighbour's well at 12.30pm on Friday. She slipped and fell into the well while drawing water. 
 
 Her neighbours noticed that she was missing and, when they looked into the well, saw her crying out for help. Women in the locality got together and, in a desperate rescue attempt, tied their saris together to help Indrani climb out, but their efforts were in vain.
 
 Firemen soon arrived and installed a power lamp in the shaft of the well. A fireman, Thyagarajan, lowered himself into the well, secured Indrani with a rope and pulled her out. "The reason for Indrani not sustaining grievous injuries was that water in the well was 15 feet deep," Thyagarajan said. tnn
