THANE:   for   application could be much faster and simplified, as the Thane   commissioner, Param Bir Singh on Tuesday distributed 45   to all the 35 police stations in the Thane police commissionerate.

 With this digitalization, the paper work will be reduced to almost zero and will also reduce the time span required for the   process, in return speeding up the delivery of the passports.
 
 It is learnt that the passport verification officer at the police station has to follow a pre-determined and time-consuming process which involves a physical check at the residence of the applicant and a minute scrutiny of all the documents, which takes three to four weeks before the papers are dispatched to the passport office.
 
 “Now as the filing of forms would be done quickly in the tablets and the senior officers can take a review of the verification carried out each day at their fingertips,” a police official said.
 
 The Thane police commissionerate currently has to deal with over a lakh passport applications annually and the present administrative process is tedious and results in long delays.
 
 “To reduce time, this electronic device has been given to all the passport verification officers and in some of the pockets such as Mumbra, Kalwa, Shantinagar, Dombivli, Mahatma Phule, Manpada, Ulhasnagar and Kasarvadavli where the rush of applications is more, the concerned police station has been given two tablets each,” he added.
 
 The officers would directly fill in the applicant details in these devices and the same will be transferred directly to the headquarters as the data will be shared on an application. The police claimed that already the passport application process is done online and only the police process was on papers, but with the police too have taken the smart way to cut the time.
 
 Filing of forms would be done quickly in the tablets and the senior officers can take a review of the verification on their fingertips. Now, there won’t be any huge pile-up of papers in the police station nor will the documents get misplaced as data will be stored in the gadgets
