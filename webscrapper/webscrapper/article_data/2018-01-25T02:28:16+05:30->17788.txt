NEW DELHI:   on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that Terminal-1 ( ) of the   cannot be given exclusively to IndiGo Airlines, as doing so would be anti-competitive. 

 IndiGo, on the other hand, told the court that it cannot give up its option of staying fully in T1 and said if in future its number of passengers exceed the capacity of the terminal, then it will move some of its operations to T2.
 
 It declined to accept partial shift of its operations to T2, as ordered by Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), saying its suggestion to be allowed to stay in T1 and GoAir and SpiceJet be moved to T2, was never considered.
 
 The submissions were made before a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Rekha Palli, which reserved its judgement on IndiGo's plea challenging a single judge order of December 20, 2017 upholding DIAL's decision to partially shift operations of the three airlines from T1 to T2.
 
 The development comes barely a week after IndiGo told the court said some headway has been made in the meeting with DIAL to resolve the issues related to partial shifting of the flights of the three airlines to T2.
 
 During the final arguments on Wednesday, SpiceJet also told the bench it was not opposed to DIAL's decision and despite the operational difficulties, it will partially move its operations to T2 by February 15.
