JAIPUR: In a tournament where hopping from the playing field to the aeroplane cabin and back to the field is the norm, six days of break is a rare luxury.   used this luxury pretty well, sighting tigers in Ranthambore.

 
 
 
 On Sunday, as they get back on the turf here in their seventh game of   11 against  , they will have a few more tigers to contend with: the Bangla one in   and the Afghan variety in   among others. Throw in Sidharth Kaul, Basil Thampi and the Royals, refreshed and rejuvenated, might just have the feeling of being preyed upon from both ends.
 
 
 
 
 But then, there is a revenge angle to this match that might spur Royals to put their best foot forward. SRH had given the Ajinkya Rahane side a tepid welcome back to the tournament with a 9-wicket thrashing in Hyderabad. It is the Royals’ turn to play the hostile hosts.
 
 The Royals bastion Sawai Mansingh Stadium has been breached once already this season and they would want to forget that as a one-off blip. Kolkata Knight Riders had used their spinners well to choke Royals and to some extent, break the notion that the SMS track helps only seamers. SRH would be applying the same arsenal that KKR succeeded with.
 
 Royals, however, are known to churn out surprises and following that defeat, they would surely be ready with a counter strategy.
 
 Both teams, incidentally, are coming into Sunday’s game after pulling off Houdini Acts in their last matches. While SRH defended what seemed to be an indefensible score against Kings XI Punjab, Royals chased down a target against Mumbai Indians that at one stage had looked impossible. That would be confidence boosters for both sides.
