NEW DELHI: The   government in Delhi has not utilised a single paisa from the central government's Urban Livelihood Mission programme, an initiative intended to improve the condition of the urban poor, in the past two years.

 Not one beneficiary has received any skill training and none got any subsidised bank loans for setting up of individual or group micro enterprises, the Centre told   on Thursday. Similarly, the   government did not set up a single self help group nor provide assistance from any revolving fund.
 
 The details submitted to the Rajya Sabha show that against the allocation for Delhi of Rs 5,353 crore, Rs 3,752 crore and Rs 2,365 crore respectively during the last three financial years, no funds were released as the city government failed to spend any amount.
 
 According to information submitted by minister of state for housing and urban pover ty alleviation  , 983 urban poor were skilled till March 2015 under the central scheme. AAP came to power in February 2015.
 
 The data shows that during 2015-16 and 2016-17 financial years, Delhi government had no achievement to show with regard to the three components of the National Urban Livelihood Mission.
 
 Sources in the urban de velopment ministry also said that the city government has not sent a single proposal under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, meant to provide cheap loans and assistance to people who don't have a house in any urban area.
 
 The central government data shows that while the erstwhile   government did not provide skill training to a single urban poor in the state during 201415, the numbers increased to 37,140 during 2015-16.
 
 Interestingly, the number touched an all time high crossing 1.5 lakh during the election year (till February 2017).This made UP climb to the top of the list among states during last financial year under the category of persons who received skill training under the NULM.
