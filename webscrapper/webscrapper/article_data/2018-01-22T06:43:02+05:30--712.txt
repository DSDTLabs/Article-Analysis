AHMEDABAD: Gandhinagar-based Directorate of Forensic Sciences ( ) created a record of sorts recently when their experts successfully analyzed an eight-year old vaginal swab — taken on a glass slide used in laboratories — and submitted a report to   police that it was a case of rape. 

 The case was of the sensational Jogdol mass murder case registered with   police station in Assam where six members of a family —  , 45, his wife Sapna, 40, and their four children - were brutally murdered at their residence in December 2009. The case was grave as the accused allegedly torched the residence to destroy evidence. 
 
 The case created widespread stir with political undercurrents. Two policemen were also apprehended by Assam Police’s CID.
 
 DFS sources said that   had approached them in December 2017 with the slide to ascertain whether one of the victims — a minor girl — had been raped before being killed. “Laboratory in Assam had collected four samples of vaginal swab. The reports were inconclusive on whether the girl was sexually assaulted. When CID took over the probe, they started review of the evidence and when they came across the slide, they decided to take a chance with its analysis,” said an official.
 
 Officials said that the challenge was to analyze the samples on the slide which was already processed chemically. The team at DNA division of the DFS, however, used all their expertise and experience to get a DNA profiling of the sample. They succeeded in detecting presence of the body fluid of a male — pointing at sexual assault before the girl was murdered. Sources however said that the sample might not be enough to identify the perpetrator.
 
 “It is a feat for the team as the laboratories generally don’t process and analyze samples this old,” said a senior DFS official.
