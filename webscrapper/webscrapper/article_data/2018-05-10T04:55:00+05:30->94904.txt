Gandhinagar: Building on Gujarat’s historical relations with Poland, which go back to the time of World War II, the state government’s department of sports, youth & cultural activities will support Poland as it celebrates its Independence Day centenary in October 2018.

 A memorandum of understanding (MoU) to this effect between Gujarat’s sports, youth & cultural activities secretary, V P Patel, and Poland’s Ambassador to India, Adam Burakowski, was signed in presence of Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani at Gandhinagar.
 
 The Gujarat government will support Poland in publicizing the cultural programmes lined-up by Poland for the centenary celebrations in their country, in New Delhi and at other places, under the theme ‘Generation to Generation’.
 
 This came in response to the Poland Ambassador’s recent visit to Gujarat and his expressing his desire to strengthen the historic bonds between the two regions. During World War II, Maharaja Digvijaysinh of Nawanagar (now called Jamnagar) provided asylum to some 1,000 war orphans and women from Poland at his Balachadi Palace.
