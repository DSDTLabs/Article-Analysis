Ludhiana: The Central Bank of India Employees Union (CBIU) and Central Bank Officers Union (CBOU) jointly organized a special signature camp — as part of a campaign launched by   (AIBEA) — outside the Central Bank of India at Nizam Road here on Sunday. According to office-bearers of the associations, the campaign launched was against bank reforms, which would make common people very distressed. Under the campaign, which will continue until January 20, the public is being made aware about the privatization of banks. 

 CBIU general secretary   said under the campaign, five lakh signatures from Punjab and one crore from across the country would be obtained, and a mass petition presented to the   speaker. Customers associated with the banks and common people are supporting the campaign with a huge response, as about 1,000 people signed a petition at Sunday’s camp.
 
 According to CBIU regional secretary MS Bhatia, the petition included a demand for withdrawal of the Financial Resolution and Deposit   (FRDI), which is frightening the general public. At the same time, there was a demand for stern action against defaulters taking huge loans and looting public money. It was demanded that the burden of such loan defaulters should not be imposed on the general public by increasing various service charges. It also demanded that regular banking services should not be outsourced to private contractors.
