PANAJI: With less than a fortnight to go for   operation to stop as mandated by the  , the directorate of mines and geology has redistributed the extraction limit among operational mines to achieve the 20 million tonne cap before March 15. At present, only 9 million tonnes of iron   have been extracted in the state. 

 A senior official of the mines department said the extraction limit of the lessees that haven’t started mining activity this season and don’t have any intention to, has been redistributed among operational mines. The official said that over 10 mining companies have availed of this benefit. 
 
 “The above enhancement is granted with the objective of attaining the target of 20 million tonnes production of iron ore,” mines director Prasanna Acharya said in an order. He said the department reserves the right to restrict, modify, alter, limit, or change the production limit enhanced by this letter without assigning any reason.
 
  This restriction may be imposed on a particular lease or group of leases belonging to the same holder. 
 
 “The production of mineral vis-à-vis allotment of ad-hoc capacity or enhanced capacity shall be reviewed by the undersigned on a weekly basis through the representative of the lease-holder in the office of the undersigned upon intimation through email,” the letter said.
 
 The mines department said that the department reserves the right to monitor the production of minerals by deputing its technical staff to ensure that the production of minerals or processing of mineral is carried out legally in accordance with provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and rules framed thereunder. 
 
 The department warned that if any attempt to defy the limit is detected, it would invite strict action against the lease-holder, including barring production for the financial year 2018-19. 
 
 Acharya said that the exercise of redistribution isn’t only to achieve the target of 20 million tonnes, but also to ensure that revenue is earned by the owner of the minerals — the state of Goa — by way of royalty duly and periodically deposited. Thus, it isn’t sufficient that the ore is extracted but also that is it processed, transported and traded, activities that generate revenue for the government. 
 
 He also said that if the produced ore isn’t shifted within a reasonable time, his department might reduce the enhancement so that the target is achieved by some other lease-holder.
 
 “The officer of   and Goa State Pollution Control Board shall be approached immediately by the lease holder for the sake of modification of mining plan or scheme of mining and consent under Air and Water Act,” Acharya said.
