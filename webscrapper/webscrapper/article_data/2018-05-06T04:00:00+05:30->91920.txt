Vadodara: Functionaries of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) primary education committee were involved in a scuffle in the lobby of the headquarters of the committee. The incident has also been videotaped creating a major embarrassment for the committee that handles VMC’s primary schools in the city. Tension had been brewing in the committee since the last few days with opposition members Nalin Mehta and Narendra Jaiswal make a series of allegations against the committee. They had even sought to bring a ‘no confidence’ motion against chairperson Meenaba Parmar. Things took an ugly turn when the newly appointed administrative officer Dharmendrasinh Chudasama allegedly made remarks on the proceedings of a recent meeting stating that Mehta had misbehaved during the meeting. Mehta and Jaiswal had objected to this and threatened to sue Chudasama. On Tuesday, Mehta allegedly confronted Chudasama after the opposition was not called for a meeting. This led to an argument and the duo holding each other by the collars and getting involved in a scuffle in the lobby. The video shows deputy chairman of the committee Mukesh Dixit and others separating the two. Speaking to media persons Mehta and Jaiswal blamed the administration for the incident.  Parmer told media persons that the opposition members had been creating disturbance in schools and disturbing the work there.
