KOLKATA: The city was singed on Sunday afternoon when the maximum temperature surged to 34.6 degree Celsius. Though the Met office had predicted rain, the week ended on rather a warm note. And it could get progressively warmer and uncomfortable over the next 48 hours, according to the   (RMC). 

 With the cloud cover receding, there was nothing to block the scorching sun on Sunday. Even though clouds have been forming, thanks to the low pressure troughs that still exist in the region, they have been too weak to generate showers. “By the time they reach Kolkata, they are left with no moisture. Thus, the city has not been receiving thundershowers,” said RMC director, G K Das. He added the region is heading for peak   and the mercury will continue to shoot up unless thundershowers strike. “At the moment there is no such possibility,” said Das.
 
 Last month, Kolkata received half a dozen thundershowers, making it the wettest March in a decade. But the showers have dried up ever since.
 
 Over the next 48 hours, the mercury could hover around 35-36 degrees, said the Met office. Only a thundershower could bring some temporary relief.
