PATNA: A group of agitated students ransacked properties of B D College on Tuesday to protest cancellation of nominations of some candidates for different posts in the Magadh University Students’ Union election slated to be held on March 17. A police team from Gardanibagh rushed to the college and pacified the agitated students.

 Police said around 20 students reached college campus around 10.30am and started raising slogans against the college administration for rejection of their nominations during the scrutiny held on Saturday.
 
 The agitating students grew violent and started breaking flower pots, furniture and glasses besides ransacking the enquiry counter. The scared students of the college, including girls, locked themselves in their classrooms. Later, the college security personnel helped them to leave the campus.
 
 Principal Sanjoy Kumar said the college was strictly following the guidelines of the Magadh University with regard to holding students’ union election. “Under the new guidelines, only those students who have above 75% class attendance are eligible to file nominations for different student union posts,” Kumar said.
 
 Incidentally, most nominations of the students were rejected by the heads of respective departments after verification of their class attendance.
 
 The principal said the college scrutiny committee found 15 nominations for class representatives, three for president, two for the vice president, one for general secretary, two each for joint secretary and treasurer valid after the scrutiny. 
 
 The college administration held a meeting with the agitating students in the afternoon to resolve the issue amicably. The meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere with both sides stressing on the need to hold the elections peacefully.
