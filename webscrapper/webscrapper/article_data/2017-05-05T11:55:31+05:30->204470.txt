KOZHIKODE: KPCC President M M Hassan said that   (M) leader   and his son Jose K Mani, MP, will have to suffer the same fate of   who betrayed Jesus Christ for 30 pieces of silver for their betrayal of the   in the president election for the Kottayam district panchayat held on Wednesday.

 Inaugurating the district level membership drive of the Congress party at the   office here on Thursday, Hassan said that the father-son duo will have to commit political suicide for their act of betrayal.
 
 “There is opposition from a sizable section within the KC(M) against this unilateral and dictatorial decision taken by Mani and his son. Congress party will not cooperate with K M Mani and Jose K Mani anymore,“ Hassan said.
 
 Hassan said that it was the corruption allegations against Mani when he was the finance minister which led to the defeat of UDF in the last assembly elections.
 
 “The Congress party and the UDF had to pay a heavy price for protecting Mani from the corruption allegations raised by the CPM. It was the Congress and UDF legislators who protected Mani from attempts by  's to physically assault him and block the presentation of the state budget in the assembly in March, 2015. The decision by KC(M) to tie-up with CPM in the Kottayam district panchayat president election was the most blatant betrayal ever to happen in Kerala politics,“ he said.
 
 Responding to media questions whether Congress will withdraw support in local body institutions ruled by KC (M), he said that Congress will not commit political betrayal as done by Mani.
 
 “The decision of the KC (M) state committee was to support UDF and Congress in local bodies. The decision by Mani and Jose K Mani was against their party decision.The Congress will not commit such political betrayal,“ he said.
