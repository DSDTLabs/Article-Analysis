BENGALURU:   settled in   have reason to smile: The state government has recommended that the   (SC) tag to the three   of Namasudra,  

 This is the first time in over four decades that the state government has paid attention to these migrant communities, whose members first arrived in the state following the 1971 war.
 
 While Namasudras (known as Chandals in Bengal) were treated as untouchables by upper castes, the Paundra (Pod) and Rajbanshi communities remained the oppressed sections of society in Bangladesh. Briefing reporters following the cabinet meeting here on Wednesday, law minister T B Jayachandra said 8,024 Namasudra community members, 118 Paundra members and 107 Rajbanshi members had settled in the state. “They were in Bangladesh before they moved to West Bengal and came to Karnataka, they have settled mostly around Sindhanur region in Raichur district. They have Indian citizenship and are voters here.“
 
 Sindhanur MLA Badarli Hampana Gouda told TOI: “These Bangladeshi refugees were given five acres each and have continued with agricultural activities. They were treated as general category and deprived of the benefits extended to SC communities.“
 
 Jayachandra said: “We have verified their old certificates and ascertained that they meet the parameters to be called a scheduled caste.We will recommend to the Centre to include these in the SC list.“
 
 As any amendment in the list of Scheduled Castes can be done only by an Act of Parliament in view of clause (2) of Article 341 of the Indian Constitution, the state government will forward the recommendation to the Centre.
 
 The proposal will be referred by the Centre to the Registrar General of India (RGI) for comments. If the RGI gives the green signal, the proposal will be moved to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) for comments. Following this, the central government will incorporate the names of the castes in the bill that will be introduced in Parliament.
