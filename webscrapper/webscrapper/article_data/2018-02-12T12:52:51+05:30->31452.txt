ALWAR: A REET aspirant was caught using a minute Bluetooth devise in his ear at an exam centre in   in   on Sunday. 

 Another candidate, Raghunath Bishnoi, had 'injected' a devise so deep that a doctor had to be called to remove it safely. He was arrested by Behror police for using unfair means in the exam.
 
 While appearing for the exam at   in Behror, Bishnoi was reading out the questions and nodding his head repeatedly. This caught the attention of the exam invigilator. The invigilator, while taking his signatures on the attendance sheet, heard a voice coming out of his ear. 
 
 "As the invigilator couldn't see any equipment, he informed the authorities who called the police," said a police.
 
 The candidate was taken out of the classroom for frisking. He was hiding a cell phone in his underwear. "The phone was seized but the challenge was to trace the equipment which was found nowhere in his clothes and body," said a police.
 
 Later, the police used phone light to check his ears and saw a small chip-sized device fixed in a ear. Efforts to remove it failed. A doctor was called to remove the equipment which shocked the police as they have not seen such a small equipment," said police. 
 
 Behror DSP Jinesh Singh Tanwar said that prima facie, it appeared that the accused is in touch with a racket providing support to aspirants in the exam. "He confessed to have purchased the device for Rs 10,000. We are investigating the matter to find out how many people were involved in the racket," said Tanwar. Police have tracked the location of the accused supporting the aspirant.
