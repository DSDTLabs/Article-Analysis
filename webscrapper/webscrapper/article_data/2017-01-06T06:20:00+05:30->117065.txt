Nagpur: Deepaveni Kondar,(45) and her husband Shankar (50), have been booked for cheating following a complaint lodged by their family friend who claimed to have been duped by the couple to the tune of Rs6 lakhs on the pretext of helping the complainant get a job as a peon in a Zilla Parishad school at Juna Bagadganj. Its learnt that Deepaveni is a teacher with the school where she had promised the employment. 

 An offence was registered at Jaripatka   station against Kondar couple on Wednesday on the basis of the complaint filed by Laxmi Gondalwar. Its learnt that Laxmi, once a family friend of Kondar, was promised by the couple to help her get a job. The couple had demanded Rs10 lakhs from Laxmi claiming that the amount was required for greasing palms of the administrative officials at different level. The deal was informally finalized between Laxmi and Kondar couple in April in 2015. The Kondars had also received Rs six lakhs from Laxmi and another couple of lakhs was promised later after joining. 
 
 The couple kept on deferring the date of joining or completing other formalities for Laxmi to join the institution as their promised. Laxmi. in the meanwhile, approached Zilla parishad with the complaint against Kondar couple. She was stunned to learn that there was no vacancy for the post of peon in the ZP administered school at Juna Bagadganj. Laxmi later approached police. 
 
 Kondar couple had tried to pacify Laxmi by giving her four cheques but they bounced leading to more complications in the case. Laxmiâ€™s complaint was probed by the Jaripatka police who finally decided to register the offence.
