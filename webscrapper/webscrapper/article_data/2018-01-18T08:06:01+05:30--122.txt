AHMEDABAD: The friendship between PM Modi and his Israeli counterpart   rose to new heights as they bonded while flying kites in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. 

 They paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi at the Sabarmati Ashram and highlighted the importance of innovation and technology in cementing the bilateral ties. Modi and Netanyahu dedicated to India the facility of iCREATE (Centre for Excellence in Technology and Enterprise) near Ahmedabad. 
 
 Addressing Modi as his “dear, dear friend” at a function on the iCREATE campus, Netanyahu said, “After the Indian Prime Minister’s visit to Israel, my visit to India marks a new era of co-operation. One of the important areas that I am most excited about is technology.” 
 
 He said both he and Modi are young in their thinking. “PM Modi is changing India by his vision and leadership. He is revolutionising India and making it a world power through the power of innovations. I want young Indians to know that Israel wants partnerships in technology, agriculture and life sciences.” He said, “A hundred years ago, some Indian soldiers who fought to liberate the city of Haifa were Gujaratis. Thank you Gujarat.” 
 
 Modi praised Israel for impressing the world with its technology and called Netanyahu his “dear friend”. Upon their arrival, the two participated in a 7-km road show. At the Sabarmati Ashram, Modi gave a guided tour to Netanyahu and his wife. As a tribute to the Uttarayan kite-flying festival, Modi and Netanyahu flew kites from the ashram.
