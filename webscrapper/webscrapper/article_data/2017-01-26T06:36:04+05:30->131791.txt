CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress has "expelled permanently" seven of its rebel leaders who are contesting the February 4 assembly elections as  . 

 The expulsion orders were issued by the party on Wednesday, three days after Punjab Congress president Capt   had given an ultimatum to the rebels to either withdraw from the election contest or "face expulsion for life". A   (PPCC) office order said they had been "expelled permanently from the primary membership of the party for anti-party activities with immediate effect".
 
 The expelled are: Ashok Sharma, Gurbinder Singh Atwal, Jagmeet Singh Sahota, Hemraj Aggarwal, Manjit Singh Mann, Amarjit Singh Gharu and Rajinder Deepa. However, there was no mention of Banga assembly rebel Tarlochan Soondh in the order. 
 
 The rebels were given time till 5pm on Tuesday to step down in favour of the Congress candidates in their respective constituencies.
 
 Amarinder said it was important to send out a strong message that the party would not tolerate such rebellions and those going against the high command's decision would have to pay for it. He made it clear that the expulsion of these seven members was permanent and they would not be taken back into the party under any circumstances.
 
 He reiterated that the candidates selected for tickets by the party leadership were chosen for their winnability and those who had withdrawn in favour of the officially nominated candidates would be accommodated in key positions once the Congress forms the government in the state.
 
 While several rebel candidates had earlier been persuadedto take back their nominations before the last date, a handful of them remained defiant and did not withdraw their papers. They were on Sunday given another 48 hours to leave the race.
