CHANDIGARH: The   has asked the Haryana government to explain under which policy it paid cash award of Rs 21 lakh to mountaineer   for scaling Mount Everest while others with similarly feat had been denied such amount.

 Justice   asked for the details after hearing a contempt of court petition filed by two mountaineers Jasbir Singh and Raju Sindhu. Petitioners, who had scaled the worldâ€™s highest peak, had approached the court to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the senior officers of the sports, police and home departments for not considering their case for cash award as well as appointment despite court directions.
 
 When the matter came up for hearing on Thursday before the HC, an affidavit was filed on behalf of Haryana DGP that both the petitioners had been appointed as sub-inspectors in Haryana police and both had joined the department.
 
 Regarding denial of cash award, counsel for the petitioner   argued that government had not given them any money while Mamta, who had also scaled the Everest, was given Rs 21 lakh by the state government besides a job of the deputy superintendent of police (DSP).
 
 Both petitioners, Jasbir and Sindhu, retired from the India Air Force, were not only denied jobs but also the cash award of 5 lakh, since they had retired as government servants. They had scaled Mount Everest in 2011, and had requested the Haryana government to give them jobs, along with cash award in parity with other mountaineers.
