JOHANNESBURG: Not until India have played England in England - also the venue for the 2019 50-over World Cup - will they come up with a core for the marquee tournament.

 
 
 
 In the ongoing six-match One-day series against South Africa - one that India lead 3-0 in the most dominating manner possible - there is still work to be done since a series has to be won. Once that is accomplished, India can rotate more from the bunch of 15 that's travelled here.
 
 
 
 The Indian team management has a fair idea of the challenges in store in England as far as the 50-over format is concerned. "We are going to play the World Cup away from home. That I think is going to be the massive factor for us," said skipper  , talking about how dangerous - and successful - India's wrist spinners have looked in South Africa.
 
 "We knew they (the spinners) will pick up wickets. They feel at the top of their game when they have the pitches supporting them even a little bit. But they are very brave and even on flatter pitches, where wrist spinners come (more) into play, they have made the difference between both sides," he added.
 
 At the start of the One-day series, Kohli spoke of 'gamechangers' being central to India's scheme of things going forward, more so where World Cup preparations were concerned. "We look for cricketers who can change the course of the game according to the situation at hand and take on challenges," the skipper had said.
 
 On Wednesday, post an eight-wicket haul from   and  , he reiterated, "The thing is very simple. They are told to go for wickets at all times. Every over they've asked two-three questions of the batsmen, that is something outstanding. I haven't seen that before.
 
 "Every over they (look like) they might pick up two wickets. That is the kind of belief they have in their abilities. The team is backing them."
 
 Chahal and Yadav clearly look India's most valuable slow-bowling trump cards in the run-up to 2019.
