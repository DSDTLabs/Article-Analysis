Despite tripartite meetings, nothing much has moved on ground,” said Abhishek Kumar, president, Nefowa.

Several builders were made to submit commitments of delivery schedule. Some builders were provided amnesty on lease debts. Some builders also got an opportunity to return unused land to the Authority to clear their debts. However, the buyers claimed, when it comes to real impact on the ground, nothing much has come to fruition.
