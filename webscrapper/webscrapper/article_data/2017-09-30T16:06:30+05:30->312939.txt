Tim Miller, who reportedly left '  2' over creative differences with the lead star Ryan Reynolds, is happy that he is doing something new in 'Terminator 6'. In an interview,   said he had more stories to tell in the 'Deadpool' franchise but there was a sense of relief in leaving it behind and starting over. 

  
  
 "I felt like there was more stories to tell there, but I'm happy that somebody else is telling them. And I've got to tell you, there was a sense of relief in that I get to do something new versus Deadpool 2."
 
 "I think it would've been a great movie, but it was also going to be a continuation of what we had done. This really gave me a chance to do something new," he said. 
 
 Miller is collaborating with James Cameron, who wrote and directed the first two movies in the series, for 'Terminator'. Original stars Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are reprising their roles in the movie. The reboot, which will be the sixth in the franchise, will release on July 26, 2019.
