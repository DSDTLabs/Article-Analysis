Erode: Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Hassan was on Saturday extended a rousing welcome at Perundurai, the entry point of Erode district. From there the actor-turned politician left for Mamarathupalayam to inaugurate a special school for differently abled that was set up by a private organisation. However, many among the crowd told TOI that they were not his party cadres, but they were there to just meet the actor up close.  A moderate crowd had also turned up both at Sipcot and New Bus stand area at Perundurai town, where his party cadres had invited him to hoist the party flag. Talking to TOI, M Jagan of Perundurai said he came to the venue only to see the actor. “I like Kamal and I came here just to meet him. I haven’t thought of joining his political outfit,” he said. Similarly, R Kanagaraj, 19, was seen eagerly waiting at the venue to have a glimpse of the actor before boarding a bus to his village. S Ilayaraja, a Salem-based political critic, said Kamal should realise that large crowds at his meeting venues were not his party cadres or his voters. “They are there to see the actor and not the politician. He should be clear about this. If he believes that they are his prospective voters, Kamal will lose the election for sure,” he told TOI.
