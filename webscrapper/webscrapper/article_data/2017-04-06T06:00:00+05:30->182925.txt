The unexpected summer showers that lashed the city on Tuesday evening ended up washing out team Hyderabad’s first practise session at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket 
Stadium,  . However, a few players from the home team were spotted on the ground late evening, as the stadium staff were covering up the pitch ahead of Wednesday’s   opener between the reigning champions of Hyderabad and   led Bangalore.
 Tom Moody, the coach of Team Hyderabad sounded upbeat about his team’s prospects. “We are really lucky to have such a good pitch. Wednesday night’s match will offer a lot of good cricketing moments for fans here and we hope to win.” Expressing confidence in the team’s skipper David Warner, he said, “David was finding his touch during the later stages of the Test series against India. He slammed a half-century at   in the final Test and looked good. He is only one shot away from destroying any attack that comes this away. He is somebody who relishes the IPL format and we are excited to see him in action.”
