HYDERABAD: In a major shot in the arm for government hospitals in the state struggling with administration, the Gandhi Medical College became the first in the state to get sanction for hospital administration seats.

 The move is expected to improve administration of 1,000-to 2,000-bed capacity government hospitals which are currently being managed by resident medical officers and superintendents with a purely medical background.
 
 As per a latest order issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, in Telangana, Gandhi Medical College, Secunderabad, will get three seats for MD (Hospital Administration) and the Government Medical College, Nizamabad, will get three seats in MD (Pharmacology). The college was so far only an undergraduate college.
 
 MD in hospital administration will help acclimatise doctors with aspects of sanitation, procurement procedure of medicines and equipment, optimal utilization of beds, effective use of space, equipment maintenance and handling security concerns.
 
 Also effective hospital design and handling of manpower will be taught to these administrators. “While managing a 2,000-bed hospitals itself is challenge, a dermatologist, general physician or even a nephrologist can become either the superintendent or resident medical officer in hospitals. They however are not equipped to handle the detailed nuances of administration,” explained a senior official from a state-run hospital.
 
 Meanwhile,   had only recently sanctioned posts for qualified MD (hospital administration) candidates with the idea of replacing the current crop of doctors involved in administrative work in hospitals with trained administrators.
 
 As per the plan, the current posts of resident medical officers (RMOs) will be converted to posts of assistant professors, like it is currently being done at most premier institutes like the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).
