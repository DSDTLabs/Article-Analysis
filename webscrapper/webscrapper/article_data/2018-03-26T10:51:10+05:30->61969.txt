GUNTUR: Even 20 days passed since the the   in the city,   (GMC) is yet to detect the actual reason for water contamination. The decision to ignore complaints about the city drinking water getting contaminated right at its source at Prakasam barrage and Takkellapadu reservoir is rising many eye brows right in the  .

 The officials are putting all their energies to detect the leakages in supply lines in One town area instead of going to the point of origin. The officials have not even inspected the functioning of the Takkellapadu filtration point despite having information about the malfunctioning of filtration beds. In fact, the field officials in the GMC are wondering as to why the senior officials are not looking into the serious aspect to determine the facts. 
 
 “People from different locations are still complaining about getting foul-smelled water. Complaints from non-diarrhoea hit areas is a serious issue to be handled as it might lead to another round of health crisis in the city,” warned a social activist K Sivaramireddy. He suspected that the senior officials are deliberately diverting the issue.
