HYDERABAD: The   on Wednesday issued notices to   labour commissioner and US-based   (  India) seeking to know their stand on a plea by scores of the firmâ€™s employees who charged it with unlawful termination of their services even as the state labour commissioner remained a mute spectator. The employees are demanding the state withdraw all concessions being accorded to the MNC.

 The petition was filed by N   and 51other employees of VDS India seeking a direction to the labour department to ensure their re-instatement at the company from which they were en masse and illegally terminated. The petitioners included apregnant woman employee, their counsel NS   said. The court has permitted the petitioners to serve notice to the company and posted the case to two weeks.
 
 Appearing for the retrenched employees, advocate A Satya Prasad told Justice M S Ramachandra Rao that the company was acting without any respect for the laws of the land. In just two days (December 12 and 13), the company had en masse sacked 200 employees, he said. It employed bouncers, resorted to physical threats and obtained forcible resignations from the employees, he added.
 
 He contended that when the petitioners approached the joint commissioner of labour, he failed to discharge his duties of investigating and conducting conciliation as mandated under the Industrial Disputes Act. The counsel also sought a direction to the government to withdraw all benefits extended to the company as per the IT policy since the MNC was illegally retrenching employees.
 
 The government pleader for labour took notice on behalf of the state, while the petitioners were permitted to serve notice on Verizon. The case has been adjourned to two weeks.
