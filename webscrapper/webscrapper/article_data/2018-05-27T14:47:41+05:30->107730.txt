NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister   on Sunday said that BJP is going to face defeat in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in 2019 where regional parties will hold the key to form the government at the Centre.

 
 "In 2019, the regional parties will be king-makers. All regional parties are coming together to defeat BJP. In upcoming Lok Sabha elections, BJP will taste defeat," the Andhra Pradesh chief minister said.
 
  
  
 The remark came two days after he had dismissed speculations that he may be vying for the post of Prime Minister â€” in case the alliance of non-BJP parties is able to form a government in 2019. Earlier, Telegu Desam Party supporters had raised slogans at the Mahanadu meeting in Hyderabad saying that Chandrababu Naidu should become the Prime Minister.
 
 Reiterating the reasons for his exit from the NDA government earlier this year, Naidu called upon his party workers to "step ahead with self respect and self confidence".
 
 "We have come out of NDA as a response to the injustice done to the state. There is no need to worry or be afraid. Let us step ahead with self respect, self confidence and with the spirit of NT Rama Rao," he added.
 
 Early this week, on Thursday, the   leader had said that his party would play a key role after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
 
 "All political parties came there (Bengaluru yesterday). We met all and spoke to them...after 2019, nobody would be able to do anything without  . Ours is a key role," Naidu said.
 
 Naidu had attended the swearing-in ceremony of JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister of Karnataka in Bengaluru yesterday, which was also attended by the leaders of almmost all non-BJP parties.
