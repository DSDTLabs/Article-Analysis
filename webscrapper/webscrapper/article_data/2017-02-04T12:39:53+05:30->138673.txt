KOCHI:   'Surgical Strokes' on the theme demonetisation which was inaugurated near   on Thursday is another example as to how Malayalis take any 'disaster' with a pinch of humour. The exhibition displays about 200 cartoons on flex boards across the park fences drawn over the period of two months since the 'surgical strike' on black money by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

 "The exhibition is held as a curtain raiser to the national-level cartoon caricature festival, 'CariToon', that is to be held in Kochi from May 5 to 8, the International Cartoon Day. Demonetisation was chosen as a theme as it was one of the most distressing issue for the public. It evoked varied reactions from world over and cartoon being a satirical medium that handles even sensitive issues vividly thus portraying the entire spectrum of responses," said Anoop Radhakrishnan, the director of CariToon 2017. 
 
 The collection of cartoons includes picks from 64 cartoonists whose works were portrayed in the national and vernacular newspapers as well as from some international newspapers that commented on the Indian demonetization crisis.
 
 "The exhibition is dedicated to those who struggled during the crisis which still remains unresolved. And thus, the event was inaugurated by local labourers in the presence of finance minister T M Thomas Issac," Anoop said. The exhibition will be on till Sunday.
