AHMEDABAD: Two Nobel laureates in the field of medicine - Dr   and Dr   - delivered lectures and interacted with students at the   (IIT-Gn) on Wednesday. The event was part of the Nobel Prize Series 2017, under which four laureates interacted with university students on Wednesday at different locations in Gujarat.

 Dr Varmus delivered a talk on ‘How cells become cancers (and what we do about it).’ He emphasized on targeted therapy for patients of cancers and its importance, especially for India. 
 
 He said that focus of treatment should be on understanding the cause of cancer rather than controlling the cell division on body. He added that care and counselling is equally important.
 
 Speaking on the topic ‘How cells export proteins?’ Shekman explained how he and his students have over the past three decades virtually deciphered the fundamentals of eukaryotic membrane traffic.
 
 He also shared his scientific journey right from his childhood when his curiosity had driven him to earn his first money to buy a microscope - his personal belonging, which is now part of Nobel Museum. 
 
 Dr Ada Yonath, Nobel laureate in chemistry, interacted with students at   on Wednesday afternoon.
 
 “Even when discarded, traces of antibiotics will remain in the ground, and those will penetrate into the grass that cattle consumes to dairy products, meat and vegetables,” said Yonath.
 
 “This builds resistance to antibiotics over a longer period of time. Hence there is a need to come up with a new generation of antibiotics that are degradable and do not cause resistance,” Yonath said, adding, “This can be achieved by formulating pathogen-specific antibiotics, which will alter the chemical property of antibiotics, thus making them degradable and anti-resistance.”
