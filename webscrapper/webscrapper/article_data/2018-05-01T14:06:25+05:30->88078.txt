TRICHY: The acquisition of defence land for the   railway junction RoB works is just a step away with the authorities saying that a consensus for land transfer had been arrived at between the two parties.

 As the district administration’s plan to pay monetary compensation to the defence ministry for its land near   was turned down, an equivalent portion of land would be given as compensation. The district administration said that land had been identified in   district for which the defence ministry had given its in-principle approval. 
 
 As the delay in acquiring 0.66 acre of defence land to complete the Chennai arm in   was stalling the overall progress of the project, several requests were made to the ministry seeking the required piece of land.
 
 Though the district administration and state highways department had earlier planned to transfer Rs 5.77 crore - the value of 0.66 acre land - the move was dropped as the ministry clarified that ceding defence land for monetary compensation was not in defence’ policy. When defence minister   visited Trichy for participating in the defence corridor interaction on March 16, the issue was brought to her notice. 
 
 “Since defence ministry was not willing to give land on payment basis, an action was initiated to give compensatory land to defence. For the same purpose, land in Kanchipuram district was identified and proposed to defence ministry through the state government,” district collector   told TOI.
