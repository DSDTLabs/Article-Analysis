  : Life stinks in Sector 23 and the residents always curse their dumping ground, but come rain and this evil neighbour comes barging into their homes in a foul mood. The landfill's odour made their Saturday seem terribly long. 

 The residential-area dump was one of the reasons why Panchkula didn't score well in the Swachh Survekshan (cleanliness survey) of 2017. The stench re-intensified again on Saturday due to rain and wind carried it as far as Sector 28. The locals said the dumping ground was just 100 meters from the residential area. "In winter and monsoon, it stinks so much that it becomes impossible for the local people to even stay at home," a resident said.
 
 The residents of Sectors 23 to 28, who suffer it the most, have come to dread rainy days. They claim to have lodged several complaints with the municipal corporation and requested it to shift the dumping ground but they continue to face constant harassment. "When we spent our hard earned money to buy houses in this Huda ( ) sector, we never expected to find a dumping ground a few meters from home," said  , 62, a retired government employee from Sector 23.
 
 Sector-25 house owners citizen committee president SS Gill said: "Six sectors are affected and not even a single officer or the local legislator is listening to our grievances. We will continue to face health if they don't shift this dumping ground quickly."
 
 When confronted, officials in the municipal corporation claimed that they had several meetings with senior ministers to ask for shifting the dumping ground away from the residential area and pointed out that an empty government land near   village was available for this work. Citizen welfare association president   said: "The government has failed to provide us with proper civic facilities. Huda should not have cut a residential sector on this site, if it could not shift the dumping ground."
