CHANDIGARH: Commenting on the alleged infighting within the  , leader of the Opposition   on Wednesday accused chief minister   of being unfair to ‘whistleblower’ officers.

 Addressing a press conference, Khaira said, “Instead of punishing guilty police officers and taking strict action against them, you are browbeating and intimidating whistle blower DGP  , in the name of indiscipline. Approaching the High Court to disclose drug connections of police officers and seeking preventive action against false implication from it isn’t indiscipline.”
 
 In an open letter to the CM, Khaira has added, “You are not only protecting guilty police officers but you have on the contrary clipped the wings of your own handpicked STF chief  , by first asking him to report to DGP   and then taking away the additional charge of the ADGP border range, to curb trans-border drug trafficking.”
 
 Demanding a high court monitored CBI inquiry against drug connected politicians and top police officers, he added, “As brought out, you have refused to take any action against drug connection despite alarming and clinching evidence but you are hounding me right up to the Supreme Court in a maliciously false and frivolous drug case based merely on some call records of 2015 during Badal regime, wherein they too tried to frame me falsely but to no avail.”
