Kolhapur: The district cooperative banks in the state are clueless as to why the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is not accepting old denomination notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 deposited in the bank on November 8, 2016 — the day demonetisation was announced.

 The Kolhapur District Central Cooperative ( ) Bank on Thursday submitted Rs 254 crore in old denomination notes at RBI’s Mumbai office. As per KDCC’s claim, the bank did not accept old notes deposited on November 8.
 
 Chairman of KDCC and member of legislative assembly Hasan Mushriff said, “The RBI accepted Rs 254 crore on Thursday. But they did not accept Rs 25 crore deposited on the day demonetisation was announced. The National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) had already checked Know Your Customer (KYC) of Rs 25 crore. We are ready for another KYC scrutiny. We will now approach Supreme Court (SC) for the remaining cash and interest on it.”
 
 The situation of other district cooperative banks is no different. The RBI rejected Rs 22 crore of Pune District Central Cooperative (PDCC) bank. Chairman of PDCC Ramesh Thorat said, “We are clueless on the Rs 22 crore in old denomination notes deposited on the day of demonetisation. The RBI accepted Rs 551 crore deposited in four days after demonetisation. We are mulling to approach apex court against RBI.”
 
 Chief executive officer (CEO) of Sangli District Central Cooperative (SDCC) bank S M Ramdurg said, “The bank is sitting on Rs 14 crore in old denomination notes. The further course of action will be taken by the chairman of bank.”
