KOLKATA: Anandamargis on Sunday took out a rally from   to   to observe the 35th anniversary of killings of 15 monks and two nuns of the organisation on April 30, 1982. On that day, the Anandamargis were travelling to their headquarters in Tiljala to attend a religious congregation when they were burnt alive near Bijon Setu between 6.30am to 7.30am. Last month, the   probing the killings visited the Behala home of Mamata Bhattacharya, wife of slain OC of Tiljala police station Gangadhar Bhattacharya who was shot dead on October 31, 1983, to record her deposition. The commission is probing if there was any link between the OC murder and the killings of Anandamargis, so urces said. Mamata blamed a   leader for the death of her husband. “Bhattacharya took a .303 bullet on his back at the Mathpukur area when a trouble broke out over land,“ said Shankar Thakur, counsel for Anandamargis.

 Ranu Ghosh, former DM of 24 Parganas, in her deposition had said .303 bullets were found only in weapons used by cops. So, the commission will seek forensic experts' vi ews on this.
 
 Mamata said she had wanted help from the then chief minister   and wanted to stay in the police quarters in Kidderpore allotted to her husband. But it was reportedly not allowed. She got Rs 36,000 as her husband died in harness. She alleged that since her husband was an honest officer and did not support the killings of Anandamargis, he had to pay with his life.
