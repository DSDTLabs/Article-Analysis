PANAJI: Congress’ legislature wing on Tuesday decided to a give a little more time to the BJP-led alliance government to fulfill assurances given on the floor of the House in the monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly last month.

 Opposition leader Chandrakant ‘Babu’  , speaking to TOI after the legislature meeting, said   MLAs complained that none of the promises made in the House have been met.
 
 “Probably, due to the code of conduct, the government was not able to keep its word. We have decided to wait for a few more days,” said Kavlekar.
 
 PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar had assured the House that roads in all constituencies will be pothole-free before Ganesh Chaturthi. Power minister Pandurang Madkaikar had promised work of installing LED lights before the Ganesh festival.
 
 “Our legislature wing also alleges that there are many illegalities in the Outline Development Plans (ODPs),” said Kavlekar. Congress’ legislature wing also discussed points to be made before the select committee with regard to the Goa Requisition and Acquisition of Property Bill, 2017. “Since we have representatives on the committee, we also discussed this topic,” said Kavlekar.
