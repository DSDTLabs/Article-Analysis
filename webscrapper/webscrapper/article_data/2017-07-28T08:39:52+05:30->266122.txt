NEW DELHI: A day after Justice (retired)   expressed shock over the  's SGM expressing reservations over five major reforms, the former Chief Justice of Supreme Court made more scathing remarks on the cricket board officials on Thursday.

 
 
 supposed to end monopoly and nepotism in BCCI, and by opposing these, the members have made it clear that they are not going to change the pecking order.
 
 
 
 
 "Those five points which the BCCI has shortlisted are core reforms. By saying they are not implementable, the officials mean to say they don't want to end monopoly in BCCI and instead want nepotism to continue. Reforms like cooling-off, age and tenure caps are well known governance principles. No one in the BCCI should feel powerful and opportunity should be given to new people. This is how monopoly will end," Lodha told TOI on Thursday.
 
 "A good administrator should work for three years before leaving behind a legacy and then serve the cooling-off period. He should give others a chance to work. I am sure there are many who can do the job which they have been doing for years. But in BCCI it doesn't happen like this. Some officials want to continue like dictators. They don't want monopoly to go in BCCI.
 
 "This isn't the right way to work as a few individuals are not willing to give up their positions and that is why the implementation of reforms isn't happening," Lodha said.
 
 The other reforms BCCI has accepted are meant for betterment of the game, but the five which they say are difficult to implement are meant to improve the set-up of BCCI.
 
 "Things like appointing relatives as dummies and using proxies have plagued the system for long. Reforms are meant to bring in more transparency and accountability. If BCCI isn't ready to do so, let the Supreme Court decide the next course of action," Lodha added.
