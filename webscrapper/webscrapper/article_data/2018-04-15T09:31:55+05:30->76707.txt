LUDHIANA: The masala-dosa lunch   guard Balraj Kichi opted for on the   on Saturday afternoon was not really an appetising one. Just when the train was about to chug into the Ludhiana railway station, Kichi was served a packed meal, but it had a problem — there was a dead butterfly in the sambar.

 A visibly distraught Kichi first approached railways officers at the station. When they did not respond, he took to Twitter to express his anguish, posting a photo of the meal on the micro-blogging website and tagging the ministry of railways, divisional railways manager and   in it. “When i was about to eat the meal, I saw the dead butterfly floating in the sambar; it angered me. How are they preparing the food and how can a butterfly enter sambar. There are playing with the health of thousands of passengers,” he said.
 
 Kichi claimed that he had approached the railway authorities at Ludhiana station before posting the tweet, but they did not respond “appropriately”. “They were not taking the matter seriously, and this lack of seriousness reflected in the food,” he said. 
 
 When contacted, Ludhiana station superintendent   confirmed that Kichi had approached him with the complaint of a dead butterfly being found in his meal. “I had advised him to submit a written complaint, so that we could take it up with higher-up. However, he did not do that and went on with his journey without submitting a complaint,” he said.
