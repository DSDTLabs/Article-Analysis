Mohali: A local court has ordered the attachment of Mohali railway station and two locomotives after the   failed to pay the enhanced rates to residents of   village from whom land was acquired in 1999. According to the petition, Railways acquired the land to construct the   rail line.

 Locomotives to be attached will be that of the Ambala-Kalka Express and Amritsar-Chandigarh Superfast train. The official vehicles of the officers will also be attached. Railways have been asked to file a reply by September 22 or the court will give orders to auction the property to pay the compensation to the original land owners.
 
 “The court gave the orders after the Railways failed to turn up for the hearing on Wednesday,” said advocate Gurwinder Singh Sandhu who is representing Bachhan Singh and others. “Although these attachment orders are given in one petition, there are numerous land owners who have not been compensated as per the enhanced rates given by the Punjab and   high court. The high court had then reverted the case back to the district court.”
