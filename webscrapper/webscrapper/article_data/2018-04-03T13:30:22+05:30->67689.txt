VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh chief minister   on Monday shot off a letter to Prime Minister   asking him to order a review of the recent   judgment on scheduled castes and scheduled tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989.

 In his two-page letter to the Prime Minister,   said he is of the view that the purported misuse of the act cannot be the basis of taking away provisions relating to deterrence which are fundamental to the Act and are necessary to ensure that abominable practice of untouchability which has no place in civilized society remains a part India nor do the oudated practices harm a common man.
 
 Naidu said the judgment has caused anguish to him and the has triggered protests from various sections of society, social activists and political parties in  . “Ruling of the apex court weakens the protective nature of the act and makes SCs, STs highly vulnerable to atrocities,” said Naidu. He said judgment of Supreme Court has made the Act less efficacious. Naidu said despite several measures taken by the governments for the SCs they still continue to be vulnerable and it is important to seek for review of the judgment.
