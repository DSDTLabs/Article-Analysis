NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s ( ) bogus salary scam is turning out to be big, with two more bogus salary cases coming to fore. A permanent sanitary worker and a daily wage sanitary worker too have drawn salary from the civic body and its private operator Kanak Resources Management Limited ( ) at the same time.

 Maharashtra Pradesh Safai Kamgar Mahasangh (MPSKM), an organization of sanitary workers, had exposed the scam a few months ago. This had led to NMC sacking daily wage sanitary worker Sadhashiv Nerule and also suspending two employees — Muneshwar Ramteke and Ajay Hatibedh. MPSKM president Kishor Samudre had exposed the worker was employed with KRML and his salary was also drawn and disbursed from NMC in nexus with health department officials.
 
 Samudre told TOI he obtained documents related to permanent sanitary worker Rajesh Khote and daily wage sanitary worker Ravindra Shende under   Act and came to know about the irregularities. “Khote was working with KRML since 2005. NMC recruited Khote in 2013. But he continued to work with KRML. Khote’s work was shown between 6am and 2pm daily at the two places. Khote’s attendance was recorded at NMC, but he did not work. Shende was appointed in NMC in 1993 and joined KRML in 2005. Shende used to work for KRML and drew salary from NMC. I obtained attendance and PF sheets of the two along with other information under RTI. Khote and Shende left KRML after I filed the RTI application with NMC,” he said.
 
 Samudre said NMC should initiate action against Khote and Shende along with health department officials.
 
 NMC senior officials said an inquiry would be conducted in the two cases. “We took action in earlier case and no one will be spared if Samudre’s findings are correct,” he said.
