Vadodara: Former state sports minister Rajendra Trivedi has approached the cybercrime cell and filed complaint against unidentified persons for circulating messages about him after the BJP government announced new cabinet some days ago. 

 Trivedi said that some persons wanted to damage his political career and hence circulated false messages on Whatsapp and in media houses. 
 
 “After the new list of ministers was announced, messages stating that I was upset and I had heated arguments with Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani were circulated. All these claims are false and some persons did it with malicious intention. I am a dedicated BJP leader and I always abide by my party’s decision,” Trivedi told TOI. 
 
 “Some print and electronic media also carried such false news of the rift following which I got many calls. There were also claims that all the 10 MLAs of Vadodara would be resigning but that too is completely false. I have filed a complaint with the police and sought investigations to find out the persons who circulated such messages. Also, I am going to file defamation case against those who carried such news,” Trivedi said. 
 
 He also uploaded a copy of his complaint on his Facebook page on Tuesday evening. 
 
 Controversy had erupted last week after the BJP government led by chief minister, Vijay Rupani didn’t pick up a single minister from Vadodara that elected eight BJP candidates out of 10 seats here. Trivedi, who was sports minister in the last government, too wasn’t given another tenure.
