MUMBAI:  , prime accused in her daughter  's murder case, might have taken the anti-depressant medicines outside   prison, said officials. A source in the jail department said officials had scanned records of all the medicines given to Indrani and found nothing amiss. No additional medicine was given to her on the day she allegedly overdosed on anti-depressants. 

 On April 6, Indrani returned from the special   court and went off to sleep in her cell at 9pm. She woke up at 10pm and complained of restlessness. She was rushed to   in a semi-conscious condition. A medical examination established overdose of anti-depressants. A senior jail official who is conducting probing the case is yet to complete his inquiry.
 
 A police offier said that footage of CCTVs installed on the court premises show Indrani meeting some people, who could be her regular visitors. An escort team of the local arms division, which takes Indrani from prison to court and brings her back, has, in its statement, said that Indrani did not eat anything when she was in their custody. It is yet to be established where Indrani got the medicines from and who delivered them to her. Jail authorities have also recorded statements of Indrani's husband Peter and her former husband, Sanjeev Khanna.
