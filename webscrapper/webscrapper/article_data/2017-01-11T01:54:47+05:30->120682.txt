THANE: A city-based non government organisation (NGO) has placed around 250   weighing 10kg each in the lake city and nearby areas for stray animals and birds to quench their thirst.

 The   ( ) has taken this initiative to provide water to the   so that they don’t suffer from dehydration.
 
 “There are no water bodies in the cities. Strays not only find it difficult to quench their thirst in summer, but also in winter as we have a hot and humid climate. The project started in January last year and we had stopped in May when only a few strays were acquainted with the locations where bowls were kept. Post monsoon, we placed more pots in various parts of Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Badlapur etc,” said  , founder of PAWS.
 
 The water in the bowls are refilled on alternate days. The bowls are monitored by the volunteers and animal lovers. The cement water pots are also placed prior to the summer season so that the strays are aware of the locations where they are placed. It is also seen that these bowls are kept in areas where there are more strays.
 
 “A reason we have made sure to keep cement water bowls is because dogs have a habit of playing with plastic bowls and they even kick and and throw it. Also, there are chances of rag pickers taking it away. So we have made sure to keep these heavy five litre bowls. It is seen that not only stray dogs but even cats and cattle come to drink water. Birds not only come to drink water but even have bath in it,” added Bhanage.
 
 The city veterinarians have also appreciated this move and claimed that it would help the animals. 
 
 “As we are living in a concrete jungle there are no water bodies here. I feel this initiative is a healthy practice for providing water to the strays who find it difficult to get water especially during the summer season,” said Dr  , a city-based vet.
