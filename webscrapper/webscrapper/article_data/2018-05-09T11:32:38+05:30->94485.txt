BHOPAL: It's final — eggs will not be a part of mid-day meals for children in   schools.

 
 Minister for woman and child development Archana   said on Tuesday that those who wish to have eggs can have them at their homes but not in schools.
 
 The decision has come at a time when the state government is going to hold an international conference on nutrition literacy from May 14 to 16.
 
 Though state government has always been against serving eggs to children under the free mid-day meals, Chitnis’s announcement has put a lid on the debate as some tribal groups have been demanding that eggs be a part of the mid-day meals.
 
 Addressing a press conference here the minister said, “in Madhya Pradesh, we are not going to include egg in the free meals for mid-day meals in schools and aanganwadis. We have no such intentions,” she said. Chitnis however refused to take queries as to why the eggs, considered to be nutritious, is being denied to children.
 
 About the upcoming international workshop on nutrition literacy the minister said, “The international workshop will be organised by the department of women and child in collaboration with department of farmer welfare and agriculture development, UNICEF Madhya Pradesh, international fund for agriculture development, Indian council of agriculture and  .” About malnutrition in the state, all that Chitnis said was that the state government would soon come up with a white paper and did not give any deadline.
