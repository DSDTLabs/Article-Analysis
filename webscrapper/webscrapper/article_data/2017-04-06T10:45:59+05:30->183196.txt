MUMBAI: The representatives of trainers' body, Western India Trainers' Association (WITA), and  's Working Group (WG), led by committee member  , will again meet at 4 pm on Thursday to find an amicable solution to the trainers' benevolent fund issue which has been lingering for over two years. The previous meeting held last month had failed to break the deadlock and despite not very encouraging signs,   has not given up hope. "In the last meeting, WG had surprised WITA members by pulling out a 2009 resolution which WITA was not aware of but it has not lost hope and will continue its efforts to convince WG of its cause," said a source.

 It is learnt that in last month's meeting WG had brought out a 2009 resolution passed by the   committee which stated that RWITC will not give monetary compensation to retiring trainers. Surprisingly WITA was not even informed about it in 2009 which it should have been as the decision had the potential to affect members of WITA. What is even more surprising is that despite passing such a resolution in 2009, RWITC continued to give money to retiring trainers till two years ago!
