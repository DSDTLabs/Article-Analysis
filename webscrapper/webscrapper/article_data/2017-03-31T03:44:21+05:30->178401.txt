NEW DELHI: A police team from southwest Delhi traced the family of an elderly  , who was found wandering the streets in  , on the basis of a   on her arm.

 A passerby spotted the woman, Ira Devi (62), and informed the cops. Police said she looked confused when they found her. She could not answer as to which part of Delhi she came from. Except the name of her husband, which is tattooed on her right forearm, she could not provide any detail about her family.
 
 The cops spoke to the woman at length and after some time, she told them the name of her village, Khirwar. They ran a Google search and found the village—it’s in Bihar’s Madhubani district.
 
 “We immediately contacted the sarpanch there. The sarpanch helped us trace Ira Devi’s husband, Ram Kishore Jha, who informed us about the place in Delhi where she lives,” said Surender Kumar, DCP (southwest).
 
 The information came in handy and the cops were able to trace the woman’s nephew, Pawan Jha, with whom she had been staying in Delhi for the past three years. 
 
 “Jha had been staying in a rented flat in Uttam Nagar. He had brought Ira Devi to Delhi as her family back home in Bihar was facing a financial crisis,” the officer added.
 
 The woman later told the cops that she rarely went out of her house and that she was curious to explore the places around Uttam Nagar.
