PATNA: At least 452 people, including 250 elderly citizens, pledged to donate their eyes at a camp organised by the Patna district administration at Hindi Bhawan in the city on Saturday.

 Ruling JD (U) legislators Shyam Rajak and Neeraj Kumar were among those who took the pledge in writing. According to sources, arrangements have been made for collection of the corneas of 104 donors by the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and those of the 348 others by the Rajendra Nagar   hospital.
 
 An ‘Eye donor card’ was given to them. The card contains the contact number of the hospital, at which a call should be made immediately after the demise for collection of the corneas. 
 
 Calling it a big success, Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the administration would continue its drive to create awareness about eye donation among people. Such a camp will be organised every month, he said.
 
 “People were initially reluctant and did not come forward to donate their eyes, but the perception is changing and I am happy to see so many people signing the pledge today,” said Agarwal.
 
 A resident of Water Tower area near the Patna high court, 82- year-old Vijay Ram and his 79-year-old wife Meena Devi also pledged to donate their eyes. “Eye donation is the biggest form of donation,” said Ram.
 
 Bharat Narayan Mehta nodded. “At least two people, who will get one of my eyes each, and their family members will remember me even after I die,” the 75-year-old said.
 
 Another 205 people pledged to donate their eyes at another eye donation camp organised by the district administration in the seminar hall of Patna collectorate on May 8. The donors included district officials and their spouses besides DM Agarwal.
