 The reports are to be submitted to the minister by 5pm on Monday or the next working day if it is a holiday. “Ministers routinely review works and this is just a reiteration of existing rules. The government wants to keep a watch on all major projects to ensure continuity, in case officials get transferred. In such a situation, there will be regular reports to know how a project is placed,” said an official.
