CALANGUTE: Three persons from Calangute allegedly attempted to   deputy   and Calangute MLA   Lobo on Friday morning when he tried to remove encroachments by a guest house that was blocking a canal.

 The incident happened when Lobo, who is also the chairman of the NGPDA, along with the officials went to inspect the encroachment after they received complaints about the canal blocking at Umtavaddo.
 
 Though   filed a written complaint with police, no offence had been registered as police said the matter was “amicably settled”.
