CHANDIGARH:  ,027 crore have not been paid by power consumers in Haryana. The   (HERC) has cited it as one of the main reasons behind an increase power tariff between 25 paisa per unit and 50 paisa per unit for domestic, commercial and industrial sectors with effect from July 1.

 Meanwhile, the two power distribution companies (DISCOMs) in Haryana namely, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) have also been facing transmission and distribution (T&D) loss. Where T&D loss for UHBVN was 29.78% in May, it was recorded at 19.27% for DHBVN for the same month.
 
 Interestingly, of the total outstanding bills, Rs 989.54 crore power bills were outstanding against various government departments as on March 1. However, the authorities could only recover Rs 143.36 crore rupees till March 31 from the defaulting government departments, reveal official records. The irrigation department remains the biggest defaulter with pending power bill of Rs 342.27 crore followed by municipal bodies (Rs. 254.94 crore), public health department (Rs 167.84 crore), panchayat department (Rs 18.56 crore) and other departments (Rs 54.52 crore).
 
 Rajpal Singh, chief engineer of the power department, told TOI that the department has taken various initiatives to recover power bills and reduce power theft cases. The T&D losses have been brought down from 34.42% in May 2016 to 29.78% in May this year and in DHBVN from 19.68% to 19.27% for the same period.
 
 The chief engineer informed in order to detect power thefts, the department has announced incentives to those who provide information about power theft. Under the scheme, the informer’s identity would be kept secret and he would be paid 10% of the total realized amount of power theft.
 
 At the same time, two power discoms have decided earlier this year to debar their defaulting employees from service benefits apart from taking disciplinary action, if they fail to pay power bills. Earlier this year, all heads of the departments were asked to obtain a certificate from employees working under them that there is “no outstanding dues pending against electricity connection in their name or in the name of their spouse or family members.”
 
 In an another step to address the issue of faulty power bills, the department has adopted meter reading bill distribution(MRBD). The department has hired various agencies for survey across the survey is expexted to be completed by August 31. “Under ‘Mhara Gaon Jagmag Gaon’ scheme, we have ensured 24 hours supply in around 500 villages under 100 power feeders across the state till date. We have a target to ensure 24 hours power supply in all villages of Gurugram and Ambala district by August 15,” told the chief engineer. Under this scheme, DISCOMs are replacing the naked electricity wires with cables, replacing faulty electricity meters and placing them outside the house to deter consumers from power theft.
