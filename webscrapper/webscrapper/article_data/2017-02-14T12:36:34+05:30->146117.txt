BHOPAL: Rivalry between   leader   and state higher education minister Jaibhan Singh Pavaiya is not new. The two often take turns in hitting out against each other. However, this time the verbal spat between the two on calling Scindia ‘Shrimant’ has divided the   into two groups.

 While a group headed by state chief Nandkumar Singh said they had no qualms in calling Scindia ‘Shrimant’, the other led by Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar supports Pavaiya’s stand on the issue. After Nandkumar’s statement, Pavaiya managed to get support of Tomar who on Monday said that he agrees with Pavaiya. It all started last week when Pavaiya had objected to use of ‘Shrimant’ inscribed on a plaque before the name of Congress MP from Guna, Jyotiraditya Scindia, during the inauguration of a power sub-station in Ashok Nagar district. ‘Shrimant’ is a title traditionally used to address members of the Scindia royalty. Pavaiya, known to be a strong critic of Gwalior palace and Scindias, had instructed energy department officials to delete the word of “slavery” from the plaque. Reacting to Pavaiya’s instructions, Scindia had commented that Pavaiyya feels itchy whenever he hears his name.
 
 When BJP state head Nandkumar Singh Chauhan was asked about the verbal spat and use of title ‘Shrimant’ for Scindia, he said he has no objection on using the title. “We respected Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, our senior leader, and used the same title for her and other family members. I do not have any reservations on using the word,” said Nandkumar while talking to reporters. But, Pavaiya is not only sticking to his stand but has also managed to garner support of Tomar who also hails from Gwalior. When asked Tomar said, “I am with Pavaiya.” With royal members of Scindia clan in both Congress and BJP, the leaders seem to be divided over the issue and there is no word from chief minister   on this issue, who often supports Pavaiya on crucial matters pertaining to party politics.
