Indore: The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court on Friday granted two weeks to the state government to submit its reply to the petition seeking   to all the affected people during the violent protest of farmers in June this year. 

 The reply on behalf of the state is awaited in the petition filed by advocate Ayush Pandey. The petition has challenged the compensation, which was only granted to the victims, who had died during the protest, whereas no compensation was awarded to the common public, who were injured or whose property was destroyed in the protest. 
 
 The petition has also sought for compensation to be granted to the police officials, who had sustained injuries while on duty. 
 
 In another petition raising safety of general public and availability of essential supplies to the people during the agitation, the division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice Ved Prakash Sharma granted time to the petitioner to file a rejoinder.
 
 Reply on behalf of the state has been filed in the petition by Akashdeep Shukla, in which the state has submitted that as many as 289 cases were registered in 13 districts, falling under Indore benchâ€™s jurisdiction. Preventive action was taken against over 2800 people engaged in the protest illegally.
