COIMBATORE: Nearly 300 DMK functionaries staged a protest at   here on Friday demanding intervention of district administration and local minister S P   to reach a consensus on land acquisition compensation and resume the work on rail-over-bridge that was stalled years ago. 

 District revenue department and the local minister should hold talks with land owners and the highways department to address all the contentious issues, they said. The construction of the rail-over-bridge at the SIHS Colony was commenced in 2012.
 
 The 22-crore project, which was announced nearly five years ago, was stalled after it was stuck in litigations as local residents said the compensation amount fixed by the revenue department was not enough and demanded the authorities to hike the same. 
 
 DMK MLA Karthik, who led the protest, said, "It is easy to say the project is delayed due to litigations. But, we want to know what the government has done to resolve the differences. We want the district administration, revenue department, state highways, railways and the local minister   to intervene and speak to the residents to reach a consensus. People suffer when projects get stalled for several years," he said.
 
 The city police, however, detained the protesters and released them in the evening. DMK cadres said they will continue to protest until the state government and district administration take necessary steps to resolve the issue.
 
 The project, if completed, will benefit more than one lakh people. Not only will it reduce traffic congestion, but also improve the standard of living of the people of this area.
 
  There are many schools, small-scale industries and several factories in the area. "They have all been hit by the project delay," a DMK worker said.
