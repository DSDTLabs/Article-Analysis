LUCKNOW: Chief minister   dismissed  ,   of higher education (independent charge) from his   on Thursday. 

 Denied ticket by the ruling Samajwadi Party, Shukla is contesting assembly elections as a   (RLD) candidate from   constituency of Lucknow, which goes to poll in the third phase on February 19. He has also been expelled from SP for six years for “anti-party activities”.
 
 SP had denied ticket to Shukla, who was seen as a member of the Mulayam camp, and instead fielded Anurag Yadav. Cousin of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Anurag is the brother of party MP Dharmedra Yadav. Sensing that he would be sidelined this time, Shukla had filed two sets of nomination papers, including one as an independent candidate and another as an RLD nominee.
 
 Besides Anurag Yadav, Sharda is facing stiff competition from Swati Singh, the state president of BJP’s women wing. Swati is the wife of former state vice president BJP Dayashankar Singh who had made derogatory remarks against BSP chief Mayawati.
