NEW DELHI: Should   run by the Delhi Commission for Women be closed down? 

 The   on Tuesday posed this query to the lieutenant governor in light of his claim that staffers manning the cells have been appointed illegally. The court stressed that the crisis cells have been running on court orders.
 
 Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva also asked the LG to clarify his stand whether all appointments made by the commission are illegal according to the Centre or only some of them.
 
 The clarifications were sought after LG’s office claimed in an affidavit that DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal had “no power or authority to arbitrarily, unilaterally, unauthorisedly engage or appoint employees” in DCW and should have approached the competent authority if more manpower was needed.
 
 Maliwal is an accused in a case of alleged irregularities in the recruitment process of the DCW and a trial court has directed   (ACB) of Delhi government to further probe and identify her associates in the crime.
 
 Meanwhile, DCW informed the court that the cells have budget sanctioned till March 31, 2017 and the workers should get salaries till then, urging the court to issue directions in this regard. The HC is hearing a plea filed by several DCW staffers seeking its direction to the commission to disburse the salaries of these individuals who have not been paid since September last year.
 
 The court had in December last year directed the commission to disburse 50% arrears of salary to its 62 workers and then on January 18, 2017, the relief was extended to 35 others who had moved the court, subsequently. It had also directed the commission to provide records of the staff appointed without the LG’s approval.
 
 The petitioners have claimed that with their help, DCW has dealt with 11,696 complaints since July 2015 and in view of the work being done by the commission with their help, Delhi government transferred 181 helpline programmes to them.
