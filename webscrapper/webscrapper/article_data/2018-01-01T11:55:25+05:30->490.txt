 In an attempt to increase the attendance of girls in schools, the basic education department asked teachers to prepare a list of girls who were registered with the schools but didn’t attend classes. The department also asked teachers to organise meetings with parents and local bodies to make sure a maximum number of girls registered with schools.
 
  Apart from girls who are registered but never attend classes, teachers will also list those who rarely come to school. The move was taken under the central government’s “Beti bacho   Padao” scheme. There are over 3,000 basic education schools in the region with over 2.5 lakh registered students.
  
  Talking to TOI, Girijesh Chowdhary, assistant director of basic education said, “Under the government scheme (of ‘Beti bacho Beti Padao’), we have directed teachers to increase the number of girl students in basic education schools. We have also asked them to organise meetings and awareness programmes in this matter.”
  
  Speaking on the drive, city president of   primary teachers association Rajeev   said that even as the schools planned to bring in more girls, they lacked basic facilities like toilets, drinking water. Verma also wondered how the schools could expect more students with the teachers caught up in activities like mid-day meals, pulse polio, updating voters’ lists, etc.
