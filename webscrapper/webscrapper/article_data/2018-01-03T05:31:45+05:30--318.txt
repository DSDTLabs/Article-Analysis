 Ekbote in a statement on Tuesday refuted the allegations of his involvement in the clash and said “some divisive forces were taking advantage of what happened at Koregaon Bhima and trying to malign him and Samasta Hindu Aaghadi”. “I am getting threatening and abusive phone calls,” he said. “We cannot even in our dreams, think of harming our own people (dalits),” he added.
 
 His cellphone was switched off when   called him to get his version. When TOI contacted Bhide’s follower who wouldn’t be identified, he said, “Bhide doesn’t use a cellphone and can’t be contacted.”
