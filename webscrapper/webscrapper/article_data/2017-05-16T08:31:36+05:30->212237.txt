Nagpur: Police arrested Praveen Tiwari, an employee of Bank of India (BOI), Panchgaon branch for allegedly e-mailing defamatory messages to BOI’s chief managing director in Mumbai against his former manager at Saoner in 2014. 

 The Nagpur rural police got a break through in the case after three years. The cops adopted latest technologies like analysis of IP addresses during the probe. 
 
 Sources said that Tiwari had a tiff with manager Praveen Gharde while working at BOI Saoner branch. Later, he had planned to defame Gharde by sending derogatory mails to the senior most official. 
 
 Tiwari mailed through a fake e-mail ID ‘kolheandsons@yahoo.in’ from a cyber cafe in Manishnagar. Gharde had filed a case at Saoner police station.
 
 The rural cyber police zeroed down on Tiwari after tracing the cyber cafe.
