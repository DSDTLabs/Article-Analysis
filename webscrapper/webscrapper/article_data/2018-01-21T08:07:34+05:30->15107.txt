SURAT: Outstation passengers from nearby towns and districts intending to travel to domestic destinations from Surat   can now reach the airport in   buses operating from railway station. 

 In order to facilitate outstation flight passengers arriving at railway station,   (SMC) has started direct bus service from railway station to airport. The bus timings have been set according to the scheduled arrival and departure of the flights starting from 6am till 8pm. 
 
 ‘We Work For A Working Airport at Surat’ (WWWAS) was continuously lobbying with the civic body to provide direct bus connectivity from railway station to airport in order to facilitate outstation passengers. 
 
 WWWAS had even launched a campaign titled ‘I would rather go by bus’ to sensitize passengers arriving from nearby districts and towns including Bardoli, Vyara, Navsari, Bharuch, Ankleshwar and Valsad. 
 
 Sanjay Jain, WWWAS member, told TOI, “Outstation passengers were facing real difficulties in travelling from railway station to airport. Autorickshaw drivers would charge hefty fares for one-way drive. Barring a few, most outstation passengers would not bring private cars to avoid parking charges at the airport. Now that the bus service has started, passengers can use it to reach the airport.”
