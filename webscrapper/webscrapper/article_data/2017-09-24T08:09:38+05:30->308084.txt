PANCHKULA: A poor drainage system had a fallout in waterlogged streets in the city after heavy rainfall throughout Saturday. Commuters were stranded first on their way to the office and then on their way home in the evening.

 In the morning, the office-goers and school students had to wade through flooded streets to get to their destinations amid the downpour. The engines of many cars and motorcycles ceased in 3-to-4 feet of standing water on the roads, and several two-wheelers tumbled after hitting potholes and open manholes.   (36) of Sector 16 said: “My car stuck in one of the open manholes when I was carrying my children to school.”
 
 Local welfare associations accused the urban local bodies department and the municipal corporation of failing to maintain the roads and not bothering to repair the drainage system before monsoon. From the streets, water entered homes in Sectors 16 and. Housewife   of Sector 19 said: “Our wooden furniture got damaged. It feels like living in a slum, not a   (Haryana Urban Development Authority) sector.”
 
 Parks all over the city were filled with water. The stagnation will create problems for the elderly and the children who go there to have a stroll and play. Garima Sood (42) of Sector 9 said: “If parks aren’t cleared of water, it will become a breeding ground for mosquitoes that cause dengue fever and malaria.”
 
 Last month, Panchkula legislator   had taken Huda engineers into Sector 19 after some of the worst flooding and told them to fix the problem. Citizen welfare association president SK Nayar said: “The deputy commissioner and the municipal commissioner have not taken not of repeated complaints about broken roads. We feel harassed.”
