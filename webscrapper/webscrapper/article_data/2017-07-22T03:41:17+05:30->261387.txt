BHUBANESWAR: The Naveen Patnaik-led   has received huge cash donations from anonymous sources in a dubious manner, a Times Now report said on Friday. The BJD, however, termed the allegations baseless and the news report fictitious.

 Quoting bank documents, the report claimed Purna Chandra Padhi, a peon working in the BJD headquarters here, donated Rs 1 crore into the BJD account. Quoting Padhi, the report further stated that he had deposited the money which he had collected as party fund.
 
  
  
 
 The Times Now report also pointed out that the regional party had not furnished any annual report of the party’s expenses since 2009, which is mandatory under the Representation of the Peoples Act. BJD spokesperson Pratap Deb brushed aside the report.
 
 “This issue was discussed in the Odisha assembly threadbare last year. Members of the BJP and the   had participated in the discussion. There was no dubious transaction,” Deb said.
 
 He said the intention behind airing the report is to malign the image of chief minister  . “All documents are in the public domain. We have nothing to hide. The report is motivated,” Deb added.
 
 In May 2016, leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra had raised the issue regarding Padhi, a native of Ganjam district, depositing Rs 8 crore in the SBI bank account of the BJD on a single day. Mishra had sought the government’s response on the dubious deposit. Then law minister Arun Sahoo had admitted in the assembly that the bank account, in which Rs 8 crore had been deposited, belonged to his party but did not explain where the money came from.
 
 He, though, claimed there was nothing wrong in the transaction.
