HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has been told by the   not to acquire land in tribal areas without the consent of gram sabhas.Hearing a PIL by Telangana Vidyavantula Vedika questioning land acquisition in Kalyan Khani in Adilabad for open cast mining, a bench of Acting CJ Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther made it clear that the new Act makes it mandatory to hold gram sabhas and get consent before acquiring tribal land.

 The bench told Telangana, Singareni Collieries and other authorities not to dispossess tribals till further orders. Telangana special counsel Mahender Reddy said that though they have all environmental clearance, they would not dispossess the tribals for now.
 
 Petitioners' counsel B Rach na Reddy said that they were contesting even the environmental clearance.
 
 In a separate but related case, the bench also directed   government to inform it whether families hit by land Act were rehabilitated or not.
 
 A PIL by   workers   said that except those near capital Amaravati and Bhogapu ram Airport rest all were being ignored by the state in its rehabilitation package.
 
 Nearly 50 notifications by land acquisition officers without rehabilitation package were placed before the court. About 1.5 lakh poor across 11 districts have been left in the lurch, petitioners said. When the principal secretary said they need not be paid any compensation, the bench reminded him of that new Act provides for it. It adjourned the case for two weeks after AP sought more time.
