PIMPRI CHINCHWAD:   — an initiative launched by social organisations and IT professional residing in Hinjewadi, Maan and Marunji villages to make the area livable — will focus on increasing greenery, maintaining cleanliness and improving the groundwater table.

 Ravindra Sinha, a member of the Hinjewadi IT Park Residents’ Welfare Association (HIRWA), said, “The MIDC acquired land in villages of Hinjewadi, Maan and Marunji and developed the   IT park. The areas outside the IT park have also started developing and a large number of housing projects have come up in these villages. Many techies live here.” However, he said, the gram panchayats are unable to provide civic amenities.
 
 Talking of Livable Hinjewadi, he said, “We will be working on Swachh Hinjewadi, Green Hinjewadi and   to make the area livable. We will clear nullahs and implement other measures for cleaner surroundings. We will also plant saplings along the roads and on forest lands. We will work with the gram panchayats and forest department.” He added efforts will be made to improve the groundwater table, for which the aquifers will be recharged and continuous contour trenches will be created.
 
 Sinha said they have started another initiative — 1 Hour Every Week For 1 Village — wherein people work on projects on Saturday or Sunday.
