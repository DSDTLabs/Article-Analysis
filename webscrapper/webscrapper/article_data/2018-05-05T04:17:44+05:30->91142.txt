NEW DELHI: A “group of intellectuals and academicians” on Friday presented a report on the   rape-murder to home minister   and sought a CBI inquiry in the case, claiming that the probe so far was botched up with several inconsistencies. The group has claimed that villagers have repeatedly said that on the night of January 16, the main transformer supplying electricity to the entire village burst and consequently, there was no power supply. 

 
 “During blackout, two persons covered in blankets and riding a bullet entered the village and left after 30 minutes. Why this crucial information has been ignored by the investigating team?” the report asks. Retired district judge (Nagpur) Meera Khadakkar, Supreme Court lawyer Monika Arora, journalist Sarjana Sharma, assistant professor at Miranda House (DU) Sonali Chitalkar and social activist Monicca Agarwaal were part of the team, which visited Rasana village in   where an eight-year-old victim was killed. 
 
 They have questioned the probe team citing several inconsistencies, including in the post mortem report, and also the chargesheet in which finger prints and footprints are not attached. 
 
 “Vishal Jangotra has provided alibi that during the alleged period of crime, he was in   and was taking an examination. Why was this aspect not investigated?” the reports ask. 
 
 The visiting team has claimed that many villagers left the village due to harassment by the crime branch. It has said that three friends of the main accused Vishal Jangotra — Neeaj Sharma, Sachin Sharma and Sahil Sharma —have given statements under 164 A saying they were tortured to confess against Jangotra. 
 
 The group has raised questions about two crime branch team members— Urfan Wani and Nissar Hussain— having been charged with serious crimes. Besides, the group has questioned as to why three investigating teams rapidly changed within 10 days.
