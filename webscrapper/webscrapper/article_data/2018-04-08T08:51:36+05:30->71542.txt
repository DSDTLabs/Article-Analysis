CHANDIGARH: The incapability of   processing plant to process the huge amount of garbage on a daily basis, has been the reason for accumulated heaps of it lying in open area inside the boundary wall of the plant since past few months. The dumped garbage has not yet been an eyesore but can be easily seen from the periphery. The foul stench has been a menace for the residents of the area and for public passing along the road.

 The fire incident that transpired on Thursday has also raised question on the environment threat, as the amount of garbage in open is a poses imminent concern issues.
 
 The fire and emergency services department were able to douse the flames in time. Thus, the plant was saved, but the issue of garbage lying in open in plant has come to fore.
 
 PS  , medical health officer of the civic body said, “There was a technical fault in plant a few days ago due to some parts that had weared-off. Subsequently, new parts were brought to restart the machines. Now, the garbage lying in open space has been significantly reduced comparatively. The MC Commissioner had also visited the plant few days back and taken necessary steps in this regard.”
 
 “The plant running at its full capacity is capable of processing the entire garbage generated in city on a daily basis,” Bhatti added.
 
 Col KJS   (retd), the plant in-charge, said, “The amount of dry leaves has seen a stark rise in this season. Consequently, there are mostly these leaves lying in the open area. The same will be processed soon.”
 
 A few days ago the plant had even asked the MC that it it was unable to process the intake due to a fault in the machines since it was unable to process the garbage it received. The MC had allowed dumping the garbage at another site for the time being. Later on, the entire garbage was supposed to be transferred to plant.
