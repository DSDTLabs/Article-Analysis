NEW DELHI: Allaying members' fear over security of   data, Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday said in   that there has been no breach of Aadhaar data and a majority of people in the country trust the scheme as it is completely safe. 

 "The   has adequate legal, organisational and technological measures in place for the security of the data stored with UIDAI," he said, adding it has a well-designed, multi-layered robust system in place and the same is being constantly upgraded to maintain the highest level of data security.
 
  Terming Aadhaar a "game changer", Prasad said that as of now 120 crore people have the Aadhaar cards and 57 crore bank accounts were linked with it, which resulted in saving Rs 57,000 crore which otherwise would have been pocketed by some unscrupulous elements. 
 
 The minister, however, said no one will be denied government benefits due to absence of Aadhaar as other options are also available.
 
 When an MP referred to the Aadhaar case hearing in the  , Prasad said the court case should not be discussed in the Lok Sabha as "this House is sovereign."
