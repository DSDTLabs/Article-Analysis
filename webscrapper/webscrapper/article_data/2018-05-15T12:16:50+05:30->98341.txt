TRICHY: While   has been implementing their ambitious plan to eliminate garbage bins in city roads, not all the residents are comfortable with the proposal. Locals alleged that door-to-door waste collection was irregular in parts of city. The removal of existing bins has added to their woes as they have lost the lone option available to dump accumulating domestic waste. Corporation officials acknowledging the hitches in the process said that more vehicles will be procured by the civic body to improve the efficiency of waste collection. 

 With at least 10 wards in the city achieving bin-free wards status, TOI spoke to a section of residents in parts of the city who opined that removal of bins add burden to them. “My wife and I are working professionals and leave our residence by 8:30 am. We are unaware at what time sanitary workers arrive to collect waste,”  , resident in   said. Similar opinions were voiced by residents of Williams Road who claimed that door-to-door waste collection was irregular in the vicinity with the mini-truck quietly leaving or skipping the street without approaching the doorstep.
 
 “It would be great if the civic body shares with us the tentative timing the waste collection vehicle would reach our streets,” said S Pradeep, a   resident. On contrary, Woraiyur, Cantonment, and   residents claimed that door-to-door waste collection was seamlessly functions in their vicinity. “Gradually the lapses in door-to-door waste collection will be addressed as we are closely watching the complaints raised by residents,” Corporation Commissioner N Ravichandran said. 
 
 Suggestions from residents:
 
 1) Provide ward-wise timing of the vehicle approaching for waste collection
 
 2) Either use whistle or speakers to alert the residents to hand over the waste
 
 3) Increase the frequency of waste collection each day
