Pune police on Saturday informed the   that the investigation into the alleged kidnapping of a minor girl by a history-sheeter had been transferred to its crime branch.

 
 “Now, the crime branch will work on the case,” said joint commissioner of police  , who was summoned by a vacation bench comprising Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Ajay Gadkari.
 
 The court was hearing a petition filed by the girl’s father that his daughter aged 17 years and 10 months be produced in court. The girl’s mother had lodged a complaint at   in Pune on April 6. The petition alleged inaction by police officials.
 
 The judges said that police were unable to trace the history-sheeter, Shwetang Nikalje, who has 17 offences registered against him. Kadam assured the court that all efforts were being made to trace him and the girl and sought 15 days’ time to produce results.
 
 Kadam informed the court that Ambure, a senior inspector, had been assigned the investigation work on May 16 but fell ill four days after. Kadam also said that a month before Ambure took over the probe, it was being handled by inspector Rajendra Chavan.
 
 Kadam told the court that a police officer of deputy commissioner rank would inquire into allegations against Chavan.
 
 The hearing in the matter has been adjourned to June 5.
