JAIPUR: It was not agriculture distress but ambition that prompted Ram Chandra (45), a farmer from Hanumangarh, to attempt suicide in front of   on Wednesday, claims district administration. 

 District collector of   told over phone to TOI that Ram Chandra owns 7 bighas of irrigated fertile land at 30LLW village in Hanumangarh district while his father owns 35 bighas of irrigated land. He belongs to the land owning Jat community and basicallya farmer, he said.
 
 However, according to information gathered from the villagers, in the absence of his close family members who are away in Delhi attending to him at the Delhi’s RML Hospital, an ambitious Chandra purchased truck last year by availing loan from banks by mortgaging his own land and some parts of his father’s land.
 
 “Since he had failed to repay the instalment of the loan, the banks had seized the truck, informed the collector. Since then he has been in trouble.”
 
 Sources said, he had taken loan from three banks, the Indian Overseas Bank, Oriental Bank and also from the Cooperative Bank.
 
 Collector said, it seems someone ill advised him to take this nasty step. Confirming the district administration, Chandra reportedly told police that an acquaintance from his village had told him that if he died outside Parliament, the banks would waive off his loan, according to police.
 
 Chandra had told police that he is under huge debt and could not repay a loan for the last three months. He came to the Delhi two days ago and after visiting several places, he chose to consume poison outside Parliament House to draw attention towards his plight, according to police.
 
 He consumed poison outside gate number seven of Parliament House at 5.30 PM on Wednesday. Security personnel deployed at the gate noticed the incident and informed a PCR van nearby, following which he was taken to the RML Hospital.
