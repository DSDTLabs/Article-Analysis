PATNA: In a first, the city will host a full marathon on December 10.   At least 10,000 participants are expected to participate in the mega event, christened ‘Run for Pride’, from Gandhi Maidan to Gola Road.    According to Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, the run is aimed at promoting fitness culture. It will be a tribute to Shiv Nath Singh, a Buxar native and one of the country’s greatest long-distance runners and national record holder.    Organised by Mumbai-based private firm Elamai and Bangalore- based Protons in collaboration with the district administration, the marathon will also see the participation of celebrities having roots in Bihar.    The run will have four categories of 4km, 10km, 21.2km and 42.195km. Desiring participants will have to register themselves either online or offline on payment of Rs 200 for the first category, Rs 800 for the second, Rs 900 for the third and Rs 1,000 for the fourth category.    To be registered on the first-come-first-served basis, the participants will be given a radio frequency ID, a t-shirt and snacks. The registration will begin next month.    All the categories will have three prizes each worth Rs 3,000 to Rs 40,000.    Arwal’s Dharmendra Kumar of Protons and Gopalganj’s Yashwant Giri of Elamai have been organising such marathons in different cities. This is for the first time that they are organising it in Bihar.
