AHMEDABAD: A   resident lost Rs 67.98 lakh over a period of three years to recover Rs 50,000 he had paid to an employment consultant. Vastrapur police have registered a case of cheating and breach of trust along with sections of IT Act against multiple individuals. Investigators said that it was a classic case of using ‘Nigerian method’ of fraud where the victim is lured with the promise of bigger payment in future by giving a small amount.

 According to investigators,  , 40, a resident of Vastrapur, works as a pharmacist in a city-based hospital. He had registered self with an employment consultant -   - for getting a suitable job in 2013. He had received multiple calls from the firm, informing him that his bio-data was ready and he could avail details of firms by paying Rs 30,000. After he made the payment, he was again asked for Rs 20,000. The company details he got turned out to be fake.
 
 “In 2014, he got a call from another firm, identifying self as Shop Relay Co., which promised him recovery of the money he lost to the previous one. They demanded payment for the same and over the period of three years Dhond paid over Rs 67 lakh. The money also included the ‘investment’ the firm was making on behalf of him,” said an investigator.
 
 Once the numbers used by the firms went switched off, Dhond got a call from a ‘government agency’ that promised prompt action in the fraud and asked for the fees.
