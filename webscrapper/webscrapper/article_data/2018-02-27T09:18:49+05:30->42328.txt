CHANDIGARH: The councillor of   16,  , came to the well of the   house and sat on the floor on Monday to demand that MC medical officer of health   be repatriated.

 
 Bhatti and Kalia have been at loggerheads for more than a month now. Kalia’s latest measure did not bear much fruit, as MC officers told him that the joining and repatriation of any officer fell in the domain of Chandigarh administration, and they could only recommend his repatriation and not do anything more.
 
 
 Later, other councillors of the   went to Kalia and took him to his seat. The bitterness between the duo started with the councillor demanding that the MC officer rehire some people he had “sacked”. It came to a pass during the MC house meeting on January 30, when   said sacked employees of his department had been hired on "sifarish" (requests) by councillors and hinted at Kalia. TNN
