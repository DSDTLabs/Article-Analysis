NEW DELHI: A keen contest is on the cards between the   and the   in Goa, according to the trends from counting.

 While the Congress took early lead, the BJP seems to be reducing the gap as the counting progresses.
 
 AAP which had campaigned aggressively in the state is nowhere in the picture as of now.
 
 Chief Minister   is set to lose elections in Mandrem constituency.
 
 Union defence minister and former Goa CM   had played a key role in the BJP's campaign in the state.
 
 Parrikar was projected as the leader who would run the administration of the state if the BJP was voted to power.
 
 The exit polls had predicted a close fight in Goa, but had given a slight edge to the ruling BJP.
 
 It remains to be seen if the Congress can hold on to the early leads.
