MUMBAI: The   has said the Mumbai University’s   that mandates minimum   is in the interest of students and even the highest university authority cannot allow undue relaxation of it. 

 A bench headed by   on Thursday heard a petition by B K Shroff College in Kandivli against MU’s grievance cell that allegedly allows students without minimum required attendance to appear for exams.
 
 In March 2017, the college had barred 100 commerce students, with less than 50 per cent attendance, from appearing for second semester exams. The cell was approached by 38 students and it directed the college to let them take the exams.
 
 The ordinance states that a student must have 75% attendance. But college principals can condone up to 25% deficiency if it’s due to bona fide exigencies and approved by the college’s attendance committee. 
 
 The university’s advocate said since the ordinance is made by the university, it is the ultimate appellate authority and can use its discretion on a case to case basis.
 
 Disagreeing, the judges said this discretionary power vests only with the principal and the college’s attendance committee and the University cannot claim to be a supreme appellate authority. “Any relaxation in case of bona fide exigencies can be granted only by the college committee and the principal and even a student must have minimum attendance of 50 per cent,” the bench said.
 
 The judges also said a student can't do well unless he or she attends classes and follows the rules of the institute and therefore a strict view on attendance must be maintained. “The university must remember that it is the protector or custodian of the academic interest of the students,” they added.
