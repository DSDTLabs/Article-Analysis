DUMKA: JMM’s   emerged victorious in the   by-election, defeating his nearest rival, BJP’s Hemal Murmu, by 12,900 votes. JMM has retained the Littipara   since 1977.

 The result is significant for both the ruling BJP and the main opposition JMM in the backdrop of the differences between the two parties over the recent initiatives of the Raghubar Das government on tenancy laws’ amendment and locals policy.
 
 “The result has established that the common people, particularly tribals and other marginal sections of the society, have rejected the state government’s move to weaken the stake of the tribals and other   over their lands” Simon Marandi said.
 
 He also attributed his victory to party president Shibu Soren and working President Hemant Soren who remained engaged in the campaigning. “JMM will continue to mobilise tribals and other inhabitants against the tenancy laws amendment and locals policy. The people will give BJP a befitting reply in the 2019 assembly election by removing it from all the eighteen assembly seats in Santhal Pargana and elsewhere,” Marandi said.
