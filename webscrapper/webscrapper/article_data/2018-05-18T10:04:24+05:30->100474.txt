PUNE: Flying out of the city will soon be a breeze, thanks to the 12   at the  .

 The airport authorities said the new counters, in addition to the recently introduced 12 self-service  , would reduce the time spent in long queues before boarding a flight.
 
 “Testing of the new   was carried out last month and they are operational now. Taking into account the space constraint at the airport, we have been increasing passenger facilities at frequent intervals,” a senior airport official told TOI.
 
 On May 15, a passenger posted a photograph of a long queue of flyers waiting for check-in and tweeted: “Horrible check-in at Pune airport. Only one counter and huge line in front…” 
 
 The airport official said, “We aren’t saying that there are no problems. It is the same at all airports in the country. The self-check-in kiosks are easy to operate and, if needed, airline officials can always help passengers. The passengers can take a printout of their boarding passes without having to stand in a queue. ” 
 
 Rajat Joshi, an entrepreneur and a frequent flyer, said passenger traffic at the airport is huge and adding facilities to the existing set-up will not improve things.
