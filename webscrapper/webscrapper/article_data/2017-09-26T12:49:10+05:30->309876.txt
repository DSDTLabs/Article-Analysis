CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Legal Aid movement has sought interference of the state government to protect the witnesses in the alleged   honour killing of an inter-caste couple, S   and D Kannagi.

 The case relates to the reported poisoning of Murugesan and Kannagi and burning of their bodies at Puthukooraipettai near Vriddhachalam, even as about 300 people looked on. 
 
 Murugesan, 25, a dalit hailing from Kuppanatham and a chemical engineer by profession, had fallen in love with Kannagi, a Vanniyar who studied BCom and lived in nearby Puthukooraipettai. Her father   was the village panchayat president then.
 
 Murugesan and Kannagi got married in May 2003 and eloped the next month. As per case details, Murugesan took Kannagi to his relative's house at Moongilthuraipattu near   to keep her safe. 
 
 He then went to another relative's house near Srimushnam. However, Kannagi's elder brother Maruthupandi learned about the affair and reportedly made Murugesan's uncle   to bring him back to the village on July 7.
 
  Murugesan was tied to a pole near a temple at Puthukooraipettai and beaten up by Maruthupandi and his supporters.
 
  The couple was forcibly given poison. The   then arrested eight who came out on bail in 23 days. The case was later transferred to the CBI in 2004.
 
 Addressing media in city , advocate P Rathinam fo the Madras high court and organiser of the movement said when the trial was on at the principal district and session court at Cuddalore, atleast 36 witnesses among 48 turned hostile.
 
 One of the witnesses Selvaraj from the village committed suicide a day before his appearance before the court.
