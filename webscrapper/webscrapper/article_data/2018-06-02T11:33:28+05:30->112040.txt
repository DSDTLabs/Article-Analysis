CHENNAI: The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption ( ) has uncovered a scam in Dharmapuri where a storekeeper in charge of cement bags, meant for government schemes, had allegedly made false entries to show the sale of 1,160 bags worth 3.05 lakh and reduced the fund. 

 
 A case was registered by DVAC for forgery, falsification of records, cheating and corruption on May 23.
 
 DVAC said the accused, N Murugan, had worked as overseer (stores) in the   panchayat union from August 2015 to February 2016. He was deputed to maintain the stock records pertaining to cement bags purchased from   (TANCEM). This is used in public works in implementation of schemes under the Rural Development and   like THAI scheme, green house, MGNREGS, etc.
 
 DVAC said that while Murugan was in-charge, he had issued 1,244 bags of cement to contractors for executing the works and he had entered the details in the cement stock register for 2015-16 under THAI scheme with proper acknowledgments.
 
 However, while doing this he also made entries in another stock register for green house 2015-16 showing that the same contractors were issued 1,160 bags of cement for the same work a second time, DVAC said. However, this time, he had not issued the cement. This was worth 3.05 lakh. DVAC said he had also forged the signatures of the contractors and there was no authorisation of the block development officer and assistant engineer concerned in the register. 
 
 Based on this, DVAC has registered a case against him.
