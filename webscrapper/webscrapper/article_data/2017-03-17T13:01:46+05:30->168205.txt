CALANGUTE: The game of hide-and-seek between   and the   is still on, as this year too, a large number of illegal shacks have sprouted along the   belt.

 Recently, following a large number of complaints from beach shack operators with a valid licence, a few   were demolished at Candolim by the tourism department while the election code of conduct was in force.
 
 Sources said some beach shack operators with valid licences had directly complained to   requesting necessary action. But, to their frustration, every time an illegal shack is demolished, it reappears in the exact same spot. There are around 20 illegal   along the Calangute-Candolim belt, sources said, with many more in private properties close to the beach. No private beach shack licences were issued for the current tourist season. 
 
 “When we complained, people from the tourism department demolished a couple of shacks. But the operators concerned started rebuilding the shacks the same evening,” a shack operator claimed.
