HYDERABAD: Contrary to some reports doing the rounds in the days preceding the state budget presentation, the irrigation sector continued its primacy in financial allocations with the irrigation and command area development department receiving Rs 25,000 crore for 2017-18. Of this Rs 23,675.73 crore was set aside for 'scheme expenditure', primarily for creating infrastructure for various projects. The rest is for 'establishment expenditure' that includes salaries, maintenance of offices and other infrastructure for supporting department staff. 

 Speculation was rife that with the department unable to spend the entire allocation of Rs 25,000 crore for the previous year, its overall share in the budget might be trimmed to reflect the reality on the ground this time round. 
 
 With the current financial year ending this month slated to tally a of about Rs 17,000 crore in expenditure by the department, officials are confident that had demonetisation not happened, the state would have been able to spend its full allocation. But with demonetisation telling on the state treasury, the average releases to the irrigation department worked out to between Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore a month against demands being raised by it totalling an average of about Rs 4,700 crore.
 
 The department needs the full allocation as it has more than enough work on its hands, a source said. But this year, the government too was hobbled by reduced revenues. 
 
 The department has already made plans to push ahead with Mid-Maneru, Kaleswaram, Dindi and Palamuru-Ranga Reddy projects in 2017-18. If the treasury gives funds on time, then it can put in a much better performance, another government source said.
