GURUGRAM: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) installed two manual   on Wednesday in an attempt to carry out proper measurement of air quality in the city. Till now, Gurgaon had just one real-time   installed at Vikas Sadan near Mini Secretariat.

 Satender Bangar, regional officer, HSPCB (south) said, “We plan to collect samples on a regular basis in Manesar industrial area to study the pollution level.” 
 
 The decision to install more systems came after the central pollution control board (CPCB) directed states to be prepared to implement the SC approved graded response action plan (GRAP) in NCR cities. “GRAP calls for a proper measurement of air quality. Having proper ambient air monitoring system is the first step to understand the pollution level in any area so that required a actions can be taken,” said Niranjan Raje, former member of environment pollution control authority.
