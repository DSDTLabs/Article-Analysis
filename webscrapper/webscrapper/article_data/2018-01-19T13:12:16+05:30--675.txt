Nagpur: Nikhil Lad, on behalf of three other partners, has approached police for the second time requesting to register offences against  , owner of Alankar Talkies, along with her kin for cheating, criminal breach of trust, trespassing, theft and other charges. This is the second complaint filed by Lad and his partners, but no action has been initiated. 

 Referring to a   guideline, Lad has urged   police to probe the incident of dispossessing them from the tenancy rights of the Alankar Talkies, which was being renovated and prepared to operate once again. After having entered into a lease agreement with Priyanka, Lad and his partners have already spent Rs35 lakh for renovation of the four decades old cinema hall, apart from paying rent of Rs1.20 lakh for three months. The partners have also spent Rs25,000 towards various legal costs too to prepare the documents.
 
 Despite the said lease agreement in place, Priyanka and her kin comprising Baba Patil, Mrudul Patil, Kapil Patil and other accomplices had forcible entered the premises of the cinema hall in the early hours of January 12, restraining Lad and his partners from releasing the film that they had purchased.
