Mangaluru: Chase away those politicians who seek votes in the name of religion and Gods during the election campaign, said Dinesh Amin Mattu, media advisor to chief minister Siddaramaiah.

 Mattu was speaking after participating in ‘Souhardathegagi Karnataka’, a human chain campaign for harmony held in the city on Tuesday. “Election should be held only on the basis of development and for a corruption-free administration. People should not entertain any political party that seeks votes in the name of Rama and Krishna. One who really love God should hold prayers at home. You are showing injustice to yourself if you use religion for political cause. Construction of houses under Ashraya scheme for poor is more important than constructing Ram temple,” Mattu said.
 
 He said an attempt is being made to create fear in the minds of the people. “Gauri Lankesh, who knew only the language of love, was killed using gun at point blank. It is unfortunate that a section of people celebrated her death,” he said. Talking about political developments in Dakshina Kannada, Mattu said, “Even Congress leaders in the district do not dare to talk against RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat. While those who land up in jail here are just puppets, their brains are in Kalladka, Puttur or Nagpur,” he said.
 
 Lashing at PM Narendra Modi and the Union government, Mattu said,
