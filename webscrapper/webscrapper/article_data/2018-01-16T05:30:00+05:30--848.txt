Mysuru: ‘Jeevit ya Mrit’, a monologue by National Award-winner   was staged at the mini-theatre here on Monday. Noted theatre personality and former director of the National School of Drama,  , directed it. 

 Excerpts from an interview:
 
 * How can   be promoted in Karnataka?
 
 I’m overwhelmed by the response. It has been a long-pending visit to Mysuru. Such a response and warmth of the people is required for theatre. Bahuroopi has a long history. It brings different cultures, traditions and ideas under a single roof. What happens in India, the current issues, burning crisis comes to Bahuroopi. In the coming days, youngsters should be drawn to theatre.
 
 * How can more youngsters take part in theatre?
 
 Since my days at NSD, I’ve had a great friendship with Karnataka. Many students who pursued their degree in Ninasam of Heggodu came to NSD for higher studies. The younger generation now is interested in theatre. They look for opportunities in cinema and TV serials. For them, theatre is a stepping stone. Training and performance in theatre go hand in hand.
 
 * What are your views about amateur theatre?
 
 Amateur theatre is fire that lights hearts. Theatre schools and amateur groups in Karnataka have taken the initiative to push theatre activities to greater heights.
 
 * How does Bahuroopi address the theme issue of migration?
 
 Migration is now a worldwide phenomenon. Hunger, economic and job migrations are a frequent pattern across the world. At times, lives have been lost when people cross borders. It is high time that theatre festivals like Bahuroopi addresses issues like migration. While in India, people travel from one state to another seeking jobs, they face danger. Migration is redefining the world. It’s easy for goods to go across borders, but not humans. Commodities have greater freedom that humans.
 
 * What does ‘Jeevit ya Mrit’ speak about?
 
 It’s based on the short stories of Rabindranath Tagore. It’s the story of a widow who ends up in a burial ground after the death of her kin. She is considered dead by her family. She seeks help from her friends and family but that goes in vain as people consider her a ghost. The role of widow Kadambini is portrayed by Seema Biswas. It is a monologue in which Kadambini highlights her life. She sees many deaths while still alive.
 
 At the end, Tagore says, “Kadambini had to die to prove she was alive and so, she had to jump into a well. Life and existence are questioned throughout the play. Seema’s acting proves why she has been honoured with a National Award.
