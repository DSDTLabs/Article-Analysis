NEW DELHI: The number of   in China last year grew 6.2% to 731 million. That's roughly the size of Europe's population, said a report released by the   yesterday, the state-run Global Times reported.

 The number of Web users grew by 42.99 million in 2016, accounting for 53.2 percent of China's total population, the report said. The surge in the number of smartphones was the primary reason for the growth in internet users, said Li Yi, a Shanghai-based independent IT expert, to Global Times. 
 
 Smartphone-based Internet use accounted for 95.1 percent of all Internet users, up from 90.1 percent in 2015.
 
 In what will be of interest to India, the report said that domestic Internet users have formed a mobile payment habit, with the number of users making payments through smartphones skyrocketing to 469 million last year, up by 31.2 percent from the previous year.
 
 The report said searches, online music and videos, and online payments were among the most popular mobile applications.
 
 Users of food delivery apps rose by 83.7 percent in 2016, the fastest increase, the report said. As many as 208.6 million Chinese use their phones to order food.
 
 The report also said that 201 million people, or 27 percent of Internet users, were from rural areas. That is, there's a gap of 45.2 percent in the Internet penetration rate between urban and rural areas.
 
 "Poverty has stunted further growth in Internet users, which has kept the Net user population to around 50 percent," Li said.
