 has rubbished reports that she would be starring in the Hindi remake of the Hollywood project "Mr & Mrs Smith." 

 There were reports that the "Tamasha" star will be seen along with Sidharth Malhotra in the Indian remake of the film which originally starred Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
 
 "Well let's set the record straight because there have been a lot of rumours regarding a lot of films I am supposedly doing. I think usually there is a lot of dignity involved when an actor is approached for a film, whether it's a narration, an actor saying yes or no to a film," she said. 
 
 The 31-year-old actress said its not good to spread "untrue" rumours of a project. 
 
 "There is a certain decorum, conduct, when you're offered a film, whether you do it or don't. Sometimes it's not classy when certain information is given out when it's completely untrue..." 
 
  said the only film she is attached with right now is Sanjay Leela Bhansali's "Padmavati" and nothing else. 
 
 "I had always maintained, when I am offered a film I'll talk about it, if not I'll never talk about it. All the speculation can go on. The only film I am doing now is 'Padmavati', it's consuming all my life. When I have something else to talk about I will do that." 
 
 She was speaking at the launch of Gillette Venus Breeze.
