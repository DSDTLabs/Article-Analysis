SHILLONG:   governor   created an uproar in the state assembly on Friday when he addressed the first day of the budget session in Hindi, a first in the Christian-majority state.

 
 While   legislator from East Shillong Ampareen Lyngdoh staged a walkout soon after the governor began his address, party MLA from Mawlai PT   stood repeatedly to oppose the move, saying it had set a bad precedence. 
 
 Earlier in the day, when Speaker Donkupar Roy said the governor would address the House, Sawkmie stood up and sought a clarification on whether Prasad would speak in Hindi and whether a translation would be provided. Though a copy of the address in English was provided to members, they were still finding it difficult to understand what Prasad had said.
 
 “In 46 years of statehood, this is the first time the governor has addressed us in Hindi. It seems the big party is trying to impose its one nation, one culture and one language agenda. I am sure members can now speak in Khasi, Garo or Jaintia languages as per their wish as the governor has set a bad precedence,” said Sawkmie.
 
 CM   said, “The governor was more comfortable speaking in Hindi, which is not a foreign language. I don’t see why that should be an issue when everything has been translated into English.”
