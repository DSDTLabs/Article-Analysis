You don’t need a prize to guess which   actor’s autobiography can easily become a bestseller, if it were to be written.   it is. The actor’s life, with its numerous ups and downs, is a book everyone would want to lay their hands on. 

 But that’s not happening, not just yet. Salman, who launched a yesteryear leading lady’s   recently, was asked if he’d be ready to pen his tell-all too, since he has already taken to writing. For those who’ve tuned in late, he wrote the foreword for the doyen’s biography on her request.
 
 “I don’t think I will ever write or put my life story out there,” said   with a chuckle, adding, “It’s the bravest thing for anyone to do. I don’t think I have it in me to bring out everything about myself in a book. Not now, not five years down…I guess, never. I think only Dharamji (actor  ) will understand that.”
