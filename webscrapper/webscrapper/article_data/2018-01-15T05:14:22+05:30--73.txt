KISHANGANJ: Days after her husband took another wife, a 30-year-old   allegedly committed suicide after feeding pesticide to her children in Kishanganj district, police said on Sunday.

 Masiya   and her two children Mashkur (6), and Arbar (3-month-old), died on Saturday night on their way to hospital at   village under   police station. Her third child, two-year-old Ayesha, is battling for life at the   here. Masiya Begam had married   around eight years ago and they were apparently living happily, Bahadurganj police station   Mahfooz Alam said.
 
 But their relations soured ever since she came to know that her husband had married another girl in a neighbouring village a few days ago, the SHO said. “Ansar and his second wife have been detained for interrogation,” the SHO said. PTI
