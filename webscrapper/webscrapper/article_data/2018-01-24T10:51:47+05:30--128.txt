CHANDIGARH: Jailed   head   's personal assistant   has admitted before the police that he had undergone castration "on receiving orders from the dera". 

  "Saal 2000 mein dera se adesh aya tha ki tum moksh prapti ke liye apne purustava ko samapat karva lo. Jis per maine dera ke adesh ki palna karte huve apni kam vashna ki ichha ko samapat karne hetu operation ke madhyam se apne purustava ko samapat karva liya tha" (In 2000, I had received orders from the dera asking me to emasculate myself to realise God. I complied with the dera's orders and underwent surgical castration to eliminate my urge for sex). 
 
  Rakesh, who was arrested in September last year, made these admissions before the special investigation team of the Haryana police in connection with the case related to violence in Panchkula on August 25, 2017 after Gurmeet was the convicted of rape. 
 
 The Dera's managers have so far insisted in court that they have nothing to do with the castration of its followers and such cases found in the dera are consensual or of followers who volunteered for gender change, which is permitted under the law.
 
 Rakesh, a native of Dirba village in  's   district, made the admission on October 9, 2017 in the presence of two independent witnesses from Panchkula. In his confessional statement, Rakesh has also stated that he had become a dera follower at the age of 8 to 9 in 1980 and had permanently shifted to the headquarters in   in 1996.
 
  He has also claimed that he gradually came close to Gurmeet and underwent castration on directions of the dera. 
 
  Gurmeet was convicted of raping two of his women disciples which was followed by violence in Panchkula. As many as 36 dera followers were killed in police firing. 
 
 In his signed statement, Rakesh has also claimed that he used to take care of the cash for dera chief's "adopted daughter"   and also asserted that black money of the dera was used in spreading the violence in Panchkula.
