GREATER NOIDA: A 34-year-old man working in a   phone   was arrested on Monday for allegedly posting an objectionable picture of a 30-year-old woman on Facebook. Amit Kumar, a resident of Tanhaiya Majra in Bulandshahr, was picked up from the shop where he worked.

 Police said the woman, who was about to get married in a few months, alleged that Kumar had demanded Rs 6 lakh for deleting the picture. “The woman and the accused knew each other but he was upset that she was getting married to someone else. The woman had given her phone to him for repairs a few days back. He repaired the phone but allegedly stole some of her data,” an officer of Dadri police station said. 
 
 A few days ago, the woman reportedly saw the picture of her posing with Kumar which the accused had allegedly posted on Facebook. “She asked him to remove the picture but Amit refused and demanded Rs 6 lakh from her. The picture was also seen by her would-be in-laws, who raised questions about her character and broke the proposed marriage,” the officer said. 
 
 The woman alleged that Amit would often pressurise her to have sexual relations with him.
