CHENNAI: In a lecture on 'Bar, Bench and Litigant - Need for  ', Justice K Kannan, retired judge of Punjab and Haryana high court, pointed out that the umbilical cord connecting the three entities was the precept and practice of justice. 

 He was delivering a speech at the late Justice   (former judge of the  ), memorial lecture series on Saturday organised by the school of law,  , and family of Alagiriswami.
 
 He said, "The Bar and the bench were both there 'for the sake of the litigant' and not the reverse." 
 
 Justice Kannan was effusive in his praise for Justice Alagiriswami, who went on to occupy a seat in the Supreme Court, and his pedigree and performance.
 
 "A lawyer owes a duty to be fair not only to his client but also to the court as well as to the opposite party in the conduct of the case.   is a stream which has to be kept pure and clean. It has to be kept unpolluted. Administration of justice is not something which concerns the bench only. It concerns the bar as well. The bar is the principal ground for recruiting judges. Nobody should be able to point the finger at the conduct of a lawyer. Actually judges and lawyers are complementary to each other. The primary duty of the lawyer is to inform the court as to the law and facts of the case and to aid the court to do justice by arriving at correct conclusions. Good and strong advocacy by the counsel is necessary for the good administration of justice." Justice Kannan added.
