 "I am highly disappointed about the whole episode of my Facebook account hacking. Though I am not too active on Facebook, in the evening, I started getting calls from some friends mentioning how someone must have hacked my account and posting some nude pictures and objectionable material on my wall. I will be reporting to the cyber crime cell about it," Shekhar said.
 
 The actor is upset about the incident and planning to go offline from the social media.
 
 "Earlier also I thought about it, but my friends and fans told me not to do so because it is a nice way to stay connected with my fans. But after this incident I think I might just do that because it is about my reputation," he said.
 
 Known for some of his television shows like " ", "Ek Raja Ek Rani", "Hera Pheri", and "Simply Shekhar".
 
 "At least we are the celebrity so we have some credibility and people will not believe that I would post such pictures. Think about common people, how they will prove that they are not guilty... hacking is one of the dangerous things in the digital era," he added.
