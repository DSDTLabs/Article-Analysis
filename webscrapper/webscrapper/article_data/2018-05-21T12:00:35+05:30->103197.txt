KOLKATA: It was the last water body left in a locality that, until recently, would boast of many. When a developer's eyes fell on it, locals resisted. Filling up a pond on   in   went unabated for the construction of a building till some residents protested. However, at first they were at a loss because of non-cooperation from a section of civic officials. 

 
 Apart from lodging a police complaint, a section of the locals approached a former   councillor. It was only when the councillor brought the matter to the notice of the   brass that the civic body became active. However, by the time KMC and police intervened, a portion of the pond had been drained out to facilitate construction.
 
 A visit to the spot by TOI revealed that a portion of the pond had been filled up allegedly by a developer for construction of a residential building. Rajat Sen, a local, said, "The developer had been silently filling up the pond by drawing water from the pond through a pipe at night. After we noticed the pond's water-level going down and saw a generator being used to draw water, we brought the matter to a former KMC councillor's notice. We also lodged a complaint with Kasba police station," Sen said. 
 
 Ramesh Dutta, a trader in the neighbourhood, expressed satisfaction at KMC's intervention. He was, however, apprehensive about the future of the pond. 
 
 "So far, we have resisted attempts to fill up the pond. But we need to be vigilant as I fear more attempts will be made to grab it," Dutta said. 
 
 According to KMC project management officials, the civic body had been keeping an eye on the pond.
 
 A manager of the construction firm, however, said the building site is adjacent to the pond and the water body was not being drained.
