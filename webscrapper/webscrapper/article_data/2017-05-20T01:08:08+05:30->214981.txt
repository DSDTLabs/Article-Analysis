Lucknow: Senior Samajwadi Party and former parliamentary affairs minister   in Friday poked the BJP government and the treasury bench amid ruling party MLAs’ attempt to disrupt his speech by saying “yeh aadat chhod dijiye, nahi to humare jaisa bura haal hoga aapka bhi” (Please don’t indulge in disruptions like this. When we were in power, we also did the same thing and look where we are).”

 This drew a thumping welcome from the BJP members, leaving the SP members and other Opposition parties’ members in a state of shock. So, Azam did a damage control by remarking , “When we were in majority, we also did this heckling of Opposition members after four years in government, but you are indulging in such an act after just fourth week, so your end is nearer than us”. 
 
 In yet another quip, Azam took on parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna, who was defending his power minister Shrikant Sharma during a discussion on power scenario. “Khanna had never been an energy minister, but how was he drawing energy today to defend his colleague,” Azam said, leaving the members, including the Speaker, in raptures.
