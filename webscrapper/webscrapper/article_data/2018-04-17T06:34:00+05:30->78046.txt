Burdwan: A 16-year-old tribal girl was raped by two unknown youths in Bononobogram forest in East Burdwan’s Ausgram on Sunday night, sparking tension in the area.

 The girl had gone to attend the Charak fair at Sadabganj village, some 30km away, with three others from her village on Sunday evening. At the fairground, she drifted away from the group. Seeing her helpless, two bike-borne youths offered to take her home. Instead, they allegedly took her to the forest and took turns to   her.
 
 The duo fled after leaving her naked and bleeding beside a pond. She somehow reached a nearby road, where some passersby gave her clothes to wear and informed Ausgram police station (PS). Police took her to Bononobogram health centre and then to the police station. 
 
 The OC there learnt she was from a village under the jurisdiction of adjoining Dewandhighi police station. “The girl is stable and able to speak,” the officer said.
 
 East Burdwan SP Kunal Aggarwal told TOI: “The victim’s family lodged an FIR against two unknown persons at Ausgram PS. Police registered a case under Section 376 IPC and the Pocso Act. Police later brought the survivor to Burdwan Medical College...Raids are on to nab the culprits.”
