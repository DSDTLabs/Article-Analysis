RANCHI: Chief minister  ' decision to   across the state came as a   to citizens here. 

 While several attempts were made to implement the Environment and Planning Act, which calls for ban on polythene below 50 microns, in the past, all proved to be futile.
 
 In 2013, the district administration had imposed a ban on plastic bags below 50 microns. Hundreds of jute bags were distributed by   among citizens. However, the ban could not last for a long time.
 
 "People will not stop using plastic bags since there are no cheap alternatives available. To impose the ban, the government will first have to introduce a cheap or economical alternative," Sanjeev Kumar, a private firm employee, said.
 
 Ranchi deputy commissioner (DC) Manoj Kumar said imposing a blanket ban on plastics would prove to be more helpful than imposing a ban on polythene below 50 microns.
 
 "We do not have manpower to check on selective ban or labs to test whether the polythene used are below 50 microns. In this situation, imposing a ban on a particular type of polythene is going to be a problem," the DC said.
 
 However, if there is a complete ban, the DC said, it will be easier to put an end to plastic usage. 
 
 "If a complete ban is introduced, we will first target the manufacturing units and shut them down. We do not have a list of manufacturing units yet but we can get it from the pollution control board and industries department," Kumar said. 
 
 The DC also said that after closing down the manufacturing units and wholesale dealers, it will be easier to stop the usage of plastic by citizens through awareness drives.
