PATNA: Making a veiled attack on  , CM   on Monday said dynasty politics actually started from the grand old party and later on spread to other political parties in the country.

 “We, since long, are opposed to dynasty or family politics. The notion is wrong that a person born in a political family has more merit to govern better. If a comparison is made, it will be found that overall performance of a politician outside a political family is far better,” he said.
 
 Taking a dig at   chief Lalu Prasad and his son   Prasad Yadav,   said people get posts to serve people and not to acquire properties. “I firmly believe that if anyone acquires properties through wrong means, such wealth never comes of his/her use,” Nitish told reporters while responding to a query on Income Tax authorities attaching properties of Tejashwi in Delhi recently. He also said all those persons who commit wrong would surely be caught one or the other. “Therefore, I suggest people to work with complete honesty and transparency,” CM said.
 
 To a question on railways’ plan to wind up the Marhoura diesel locomotive factory being set up in Saran district just two years after the project was awarded, Nitish said he had also seen a report in this regard in media and he would personally talk to railway minister Piyush Goyal to know the truth.
 
 “Though it is fact that railways has expedited works on electrification, it will have to keep diesel locomotives because it is not possible to electrify all routes in a few years. Even if all routes are electrified, railways can continue with diesel locomotive factory because if it is manufacturing “efficient engines” which can be exported to other countries,” CM said.
