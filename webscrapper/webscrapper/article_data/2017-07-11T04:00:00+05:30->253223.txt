AHMEDABAD: It was not a season for kites but there were scores of kites in the sky near   on Sunday morning. The ‘kite festival’ was organized by   where representatives from Ahmedabad and other cities had participated with large number of kites which were distributed to citizens to spread message.

 “The new Goods and   (GST) regime will deliver a body blow to the cottage industry, as we will have no other option but to pass on the hefty price rise to the customers. We made several representations to the authorities, but to no avail. Thus, we decided to celebrate the untimely festival as there might be no kites for the next kite festival,” said Atik Patangwala, a participant.
 
 The kite makers had made 10-feet tall kite with message—‘Remove GST, Save kite-making industry.’ The kitists also showed their skill with kites to attract the crowd.
