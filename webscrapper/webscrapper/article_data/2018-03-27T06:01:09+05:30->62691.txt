KOLKATA: Students of classes V and VIII in   schools fared poorly vis-à-vis states like Gujarat, Kerala and Maharashtra in terms of performance in mathematics, languages, science and social science, reveals the 2017 National Achievement Survey.

 The “State Learning Report”, released on Monday, was conducted by   for students of classes III, V and VIII, and teachers of government and government-aided schools. The findings are based on a test conducted for students and a questionnaire given to teachers. As many as 30,000 students in Bengal took the exam from 22 districts, said a senior NCERT official.
 
 The report paints a dismal picture for Bengal, especially as students move up the classes. And shockingly, only 47% teachers are aware of curriculum goals, it says. 
 
 While in Class III, 71% students could answer mathematics and environmental science questions correctly, in languages the percentage was 75%. But the performance gradually deteriorated in higher classes. In Class V, 48% students answered mathematics questions correctly, followed by 54% in EVS and 56% in languages. The percentage hits rock bottom in Class VIII, when only 38% students could answer social science questions correctly, followed by 39% in mathematics, 41% in science and 55% in languages.
 
 In Karnataka, 67% students of Class V correctly answered mathematics questions, 68% in EVS and 71% in languages. While in Kerala, 63% students answered mathematics, 65% EVS and 69% students correctly answered languages in the same class.
 
 Students from Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha are way above Bengal in Class VIII. In Karnataka, 63% students answered language questions correctly followed by 51% in mathematics. In science, 53% answered correctly and 51% succeeded in social science. In Odisha, 53% students of Class VIII answered language questions correctly followed by 44% in mathematics, 44% in science and 41% in social science. In Gujarat, 64% students answered language, 47% correctly answered mathematics, 52% answered science and 54% correctly gave answers to social science questions.
 
 Educationist Amal Mukhopadhyay who has been a principal of erstwhile   said, “It reveals the poor state of education in Bengal. Education is in a crisis. Largely, the government should have taken control of education. The state of our colleges and universities is not any better.” 
 
 The survey also points out that in Bengal only 47% teachers in the state fully understand the curricular goals while the percentage is much higher in Maharashtra – 67%, Tamil Nadu – 57%, Karnataka – 83%, Kerala – 77% and Gujarat – 84%.
 
 In Bengal only 81% children in Class III and 79% in Class V understand what teachers say in the classroom. In Gujarat, 93% children in Class III, 95% in Class V and 96% children in Class VIII could comprehend classroom teaching. In Kerala, 90% children in Class III, 87% in Class V and 75% children in Class VIII could understand what teachers said in the classroom. In Maharashtra, the figures were 90%, and 91% for Class V and Class VIII respectively.
 
 The question was formulated and distributed in accordance with the NCERT syllabus, said syllabus revamp committee chairman Aveek Mazumdar. “ Interestingly, the questions which were given out to the students were not similar to   framed curriculum. The questions selected by NCERT where not revised and made suitable for individual state candidates. So, the problem lies in the framing of questions. If once looks at the Utkarsha Abhijan which is Bengal’s own achievement survey, the result is somehow the opposite,” added Mazumdar.
 
 A school principal pointed out that the parity in syllabus has been achieved from class IX onwards, looking at students appearing in national entrance tests.
 
 Also, in Bengal 27% of teachers opined that they are overloaded with work. In Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, the percentages were a mere 5% and 12%. In Kerala only 10% teachers said that they were overworked.
 
 “We have the same hours of teaching as in CBSE run schools. Why should our teachers be stressed?” asked Majumdar.
