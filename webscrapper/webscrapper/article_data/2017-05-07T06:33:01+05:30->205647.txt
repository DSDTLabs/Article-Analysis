Nashik: The civic body recently desilted Ramkund and is also in process of cleaning nearby ponds as part of its routine exercise.

  have written to Mayor Ranjana Bhansi and BJP MLA Balasaheb Sanap to get the Godavari desilted so that there is better water storage and less damage in the monsoon.
 
 According to environment activists, desilting of the river bed before the monsoon will help in seepage of rainwater into the river. “Two days ago, the government approved a resolution on a silt-free river. I proposed that in this backdrop, desilting of the entire river should be done,”  , an environmentalist and Panchavati resident, said. He added that the Gangapur dam had 43.5% silt. 
 
 He added that ever since the dam’s construction, desilting has been done only once and that too by the NGOs. “According to a National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) report in 2004, said   would cost Rs 22 crore and land for pumping it will also have to be managed. Instead, they suggested constructing the Kikwi dam. Neither was the dam constructed, nor Gangapur dam desilted. They had suggested a provision for parallel water supply,” Jani said.
 
 He added that Magsaysay Award winner   had suggested contour mapping of the Gangapur dam. “Dead stock of water will go down and can be channeled to fill wells. Removing silt will increase the water storage capacity of the dam, river and catchment areas. During flood-like situations, low-lying areas will not face the damage they otherwise do,” Jani said.
 
 Sanap said he will be taking up the issue with the state government on Tuesday. “A delegation came to me with a proposal. They will also be submitting the proposal to the mayor. I will also be discussing this with the mayor. On Tuesday, I will talk to the guardian minister,   In case we need funds, he can push the matter ahead,” he said.
