KOLKATA: The   health department on Monday gave a clean chit to frozen chicken samples that the civic food inspectors had collected from Gariahat and   last week. 

 A test done on the frozen samples at the KMC laboratory found no chemical substance, said Atin Ghosh, the member, mayor-in-council overseeing the KMC health department. On last Saturday, the civic body had given similar clean chits to raw and cooked chicken that had been collected from different markets, including New Market, Entally Market and Ultadanga.
 
 However, the KMC health department top brass on Monday made it clear that the drive against dead or stale chicken would continue. "We have already collected samples of raw and frozen chicken from Gariahat, Lake Market, New Market, Shyambazar and Dum Dum markets during the day. These will be tested at our laboratory on Tuesday," Ghosh said on Monday.
 
 Apart from testing the samples at the KMC laboratory, the same will be sent to   for a re-check. "We will extract portions of meat from raw chicken and send those to JU for a double test. The JU tests will determine presence of bacteria in the raw chicken besides ensuring presence of formalin," said a KMC health department official.
 
 The KMC food inspectors have been asked to keep a vigil on the roadside chicken biryani stalls across the city.
