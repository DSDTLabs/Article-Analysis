LUCKNOW: Eight people were involved in the sabotage that led to derailment of   at   near Kanpur on November 20, in which 145 passengers were killed. This has come to light in the interrogation of three   operatives by UP  . 

 The three, arrested by Motihari police in Bihar early this weeek, confessed that the Pakistani agency was behind recent train accidents, including the one at Pukhrayan. A team of UP ATS is camping in Motihari to interrogate them.
 
 While initially it was believed that fractures in the rail track had caused the accident, the case took a sudden turn with the arrest of three ISI operatives. Sharing the findings gathered during interrogation, IG ATS, Asim Arun, said that so far, it had been found that seven people worked under Brij Kishore Giri, a Nepali citizen connected to ISI.
 
 “The gang used 10-litre cooker bombs. They have owned up to two instances of sabotage attempts which took place on outskirts of Kanpur recently. The second attempt was foiled during routine inspection,” said Arun.
 
 The team plans to inspect the accident site and take the damaged tracks into possession. Through forensic examination, the ATS will try to find out whether explosives caused the accident. Police have managed to gather the details of bank accounts the gang used. Through electronic surveillance, the sleuths are trying to find out if the gang was present in Kanpur Dehat around the time of incident. “We are connecting the dots and verifying facts before coming to a conclusion,” said Arun.
