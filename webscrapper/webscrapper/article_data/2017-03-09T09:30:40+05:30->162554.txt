AHMEDABAD: In over a decade, since 2006, and after crores were poured into the health sector, Gujarat recorded an 8 % rise in the number of wasted and 4% rise in severely-wasted children below 5 years.

 Wasting or thinness, according to WHO indicates a severe process of weight loss associated with starvation, a severe disease or malnourishment.
 
  Another strong indicator of prevailing nutrition problem is that more than 62% children under 5 years age in Gujarat are anaemic. Which means they suffer from low quantity of haemoglobin caused by nutritional deficiency making them vulnerable to diseases and poor brain development. The national average is 58%.
 
 The recently released   2015-16 has brought forth a grim reality for Gujarat where levels of malnourishment, poverty, amidst towering economic indices and GDP growth is a stark reality. 
 
 Improvements needed in these sectors have been slow. Women too have not made much improvement in their health since the last NFHS survey in 2006.
 
 The latest NFHS survey claims that almost 51% Gujarat women are anaemic when pregnant. This apart, the percentage of children between 6 to 8 months who should be receiving solid, semi solid food and breast milk recorded a drop from 54% to 49.4%. About 50% children in Gujarat after birth are not being immunised -- BCG, measles, 3 doses of polio and DPT.
 
 Overall in state, 55 % women are anaemic, with a large chunk of 57% women in villages suffering this condition. More than 44% children under 5 years in villages are underweight, higher than what it was in 2006. Amongst men 21% of the 15-49 year age group are anaemic, which is just a meagre 1% improvement in 10 years. 
 
 On the bright side,   (IMR) has improved from 50 amongst 10,000 infants in 2006 to 34, while in case of children under 5 years, mortality rate has reduced from 61 to 43 per 10,000 children. In term of birth control the use of pills and condoms have reduced, while there is marginal increase in obese men and women.
 
 More women in Gujarat are moving towards financial independence. 85% women participate in household decisions, 27.2% women own properties, and among women owning bank accounts, 48.6% have doubled in last decade.
 
 The survey however, pointed out that overall 20.1% of women in the state had experienced spousal violence. Some 24.8 % of women in villages and 14.1% of women in urban areas were victim of spousal violence. In case of nutritional status 27.2% women had a body mass index (BMI) below normal, while it was 24.7% in case of men.
 
 However, obesity increased in women from 16.7% in 2006 to 23.7% in the latest survey, while in case of men it increased from 11.3% to 19.7%.
