BHOPAL: There has been a yawning gap between the demand and the supply of   (PoS), popularly known as swipe machines, in the aftermath of demonetisation. There is huge pendency in banks while traders continue to wait for installing them to facilitate cashless transactions.

Against a demand of 21,361 PoS with the State Bank of India, 7,926 have been installed, an official spokesman of the bank told TOI. Of them 9,798 PoS were demanded in December alone. In  , 350 people had applied for it while only 150 PoS could be supplied. 
 
 In the absence of PoS, many traders have been using other modes of payment to keep the business running.
 
 Rajesh Chandra, a grocery store owner at  , said, "I have applied for the PoS and have been waiting for the last 15 days. Hope I will get it soon."  , owner of a restaurant at Gulmohar Colony, said, "After 20 days' wait I have opted for a mini PoS, which has more benefits. It's a sleek machine, smaller than the conventional swipe machine, but more efficient."
 
 New market Vyapari Sangh president Satish Gangrade, however, said, "On Saturdays amd Sundays, the PoS simply doesn't work because of server problems." There are occasions when the shopkeepers incur losses, as the customer goes away without purchasing goods.
