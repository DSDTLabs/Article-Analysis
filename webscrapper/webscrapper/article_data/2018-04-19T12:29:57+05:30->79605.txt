LUDHIANA: A day after news of orders by a   court ordering waiving off toll fee on   spread, total chaos was witnessed as the management of the toll refused to let vehicles pass through without paying the toll, citing the reason that they had not received any court orders yet. Commuters, on the other hand, were adamant on passing through the toll without paying any charges, citing court orders. It was in the afternoon when Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief and   reached the toll plaza and confronted the manager of the toll plaza, after which the plaza allowed vehicles to pass through without paying any charges.

 Meanwhile, speaking to TOI on the issue,   said: “The company managing the toll plaza is indulging in ‘gundagardi’, and violating law. Acting on a petition filed against the   (NHAI) for its failure to remove encroachments along the national highway and ignoring safety norms, Permanent Lok Adalat of Kapurthala on April 17 ordered   to not to charge toll at   toll plaza until it complied with the previous court orders issued on April 15 in the same case. Bains also said: “Until I arrived at the spot, the toll plaza operators were fleecing the public by charging fee and blatantly refusing to follow fresh court orders, which is a fit case of ‘contempt of court’. It was after we showed the orders to the toll plaza in-charge that they stopped charging the fee.”
 
 However, TOI learnt that the moment Bains left the toll, the company again started charging toll from commuters. Speaking on the issue, Bains said: “I have also received a complaint from some people that they were charged toll this evening as well. I have decided to file a case against NHAI and the company managing the toll plaza for contempt of court, and non-compliance of court orders. In addition, we will lodge a complaint with the police commissioner tomorrow, and LIP volunteers will be stationed at the toll plaza to keep a check on illegal charging of toll fee.”
