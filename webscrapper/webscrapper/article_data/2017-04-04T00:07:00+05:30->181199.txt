Indore: Nayagoan police in Neemuch arrested two persons on Monday for their involvement in illegal   trade. The police nabbed both the miscreants in Nayagoan with about 17 kgs of opium and 60 kg of poppy husk. The market value of the substance was stated to be around Rs 30 lakh.

 Acting on specific information, a team of Nayagaon police, led by station in-charge Kamal Singaar, caught Jaswant Jaat of Punjab while he allegedly tried to ferry 10 kg of opium and 60 kg of poppy husk in a four-wheeler late on Sunday night.
 
 “Jaat denied his involvement. Cops then searched his vehicle but could not find anything objectionable. When it was searched again, the team found opium was kept in a partition created on the vehicle’s roof,” superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Singh said.
 
 He added that based on Jaat’s disclosure, police also managed to nab his aide Vishal Patidar of Mandsaur district. Patidar allegedly sold the substance to Jaat. The police seized around 7 kg of opium from Patidar.
 
 “Jaat had bought the substance from Patidar and was ferrying it to Rajasthan. The market value of opium and poppy husk recovered from both of them is around Rs 30 lakh,” Singaar told TOI.
 
 He added that it was the first recovery of opium in such large quantities in the last five years.
 
 “By keeping a close vigil on those involved in the illegal trade of opium in recent past, the local police have managed to keep a check on the crime by a great extent,” Singaar claimed.
 
 He added that Jaat had been involved in opium trade and when he was seen roaming the area, police nabbed him to further recover a large quantity of banned substance from his possession.
