AURANGABAD: Around 60   contract workers of the   ( ) staged an agitation on Monday before the medical superintendent’s office demanding regularisation of their wage payment.

 The workers have been hired on a contract basis by the GMCH through a Padegaon-based private agency for doing odd jobs. Though the workers are entitled to a minimum wage of Rs 8,627 a month as set by the labour department, the workers alleged their hiring agency pays them Rs 5,000. They have not received their salaries for the last two months. 
 
 In a written complaint to the GMCH dean, the workers stated their wages are being paid in cash instead of being deposited in their bank accounts as directed by the government. 
 
 The contract workers further alleged the provident fund (PF) amount is neither being deposted in the PF office, nor has the PF number been provided to them. The letter stated the contractor has not registered their names for Employees’ State Insurance. 
 
 The letter further reads that the workers are neither paid for overtime, nor for working on public holidays. “Our daily attendance records are not maintained properly but a certain amount is deducted from our salary according to the whims and fancies of the contractor,” says the letter. 
 
 Since their joining on October 2017, the workers are being paid their remuneration in cash after they sign on a register and a typed paper. The workers alleged that when they ask about the content of the typed paper they sign on against the receipt of their salary, they are threatened and told that they would lose their salaries and jobs. 
 
 In February, the workers had apprised the GMCH dean and appealed for the disbursement of their salaries in the presence of GMCH officials but to no avail. They have demanded action against the contractor and sent a copy of their memorandum to local MLAs and the state medical education minister.
