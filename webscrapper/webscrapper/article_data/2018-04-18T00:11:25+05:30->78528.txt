THANE: With their   fast approaching,   have already begun chalking out   with their families and friends to not only make the most of their   days but also get out of the   heat. 

 Be it relaxing or adventurous trips to the north such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand or even tours abroad across the UK and the US, Thaneites have set their minds on their short vacation away from the hot sun.
 
 “My family is planning a vacation this summer as I will be entering class X this year, and will not be able to go on a vacation later. After sifting to various options, we narrowed down to a Europe trip,” said Siddhi Shah (14), a Hiranandani Estate resident who recently applied for her visa.
 
 Meanwhile, Kopri resident Pooja Raisinghani (25) who will be going for a trip to Uttarakhand this week, said, “This is the peak season to visit to places like Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir and Uttarakhand as it is pleasant there and gets really frigid later in the winter. However, this trip is more about adventure and meeting and befriending new people who are backpacking and trekking there as well. Getting away from the sweltering heat here is just another bonus.”
 
 While these Thaneites are still in the process of planning their trips, many class X and XII students who recently finished their board exams have already started arming themselves with their woollens, ski gear and selfie sticks and making the most of the summer breaks.
 
 “Every day we have over five to six people coming to us to plan their vacations. While families who are planning trips abroad have begun applying for their US, UK and Canada Visas which take about 15 days, many friends groups and even families have booked tour packages to Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and even the northeast in advance to avail cheaper tickets,” said an official from city-based holidays agency.
