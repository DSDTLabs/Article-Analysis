KOLHAPUR: The Laxmipuri police have arrested a man for allegedly issuing fake medical certificates to some of the employees of government and semi-government sector for availing of leave. 

 Balasaheb Baburao Kamble-Belekar (50), a resident of Rashiwade Khurd in Radhanagari taluka, was arrested on Monday, following a hunt for more than six months.
 
 Kamble used to provide certificates similar to those issued by the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital, police said on Tuesday, adding that he had been absconding since June last year.
 
 According to police, a government employee who wants to take sick leave is required to produce a medical certificate issued by CPR, duly signed by a civil surgeon. 
 
 The incident came to light in March 2016 after   officials sent medical certificates of seven employees for verification. The employees had produced certificates, purportedly issued by the  , saying that they were suffering from tuberculosis. 
 
 The hospital authorities found the certificates to be bogus. Harshala Vedak, who was then in-charge of TB department of CPR civil hospital, lodged a police complaint. 
 
 Four MSRTC employees —   of Shahuwadi, Shahanul Isabu Mulla of Shiroli Pulachi, taluka Hatkanangle;   of Kini, Hatkanangle taluka; and Asha Shankar Asulkar of Virale village, taluka Shahuwaid — were arrested on the charges of forgery in June last year. 
 
 The four had revealed Kamble’s name under interrogation, but the suspect went absconding, the police said. “Kamble was finally arrested from his residence on Monday. The arrest was made following a tip-off that he would visit his home,” said the investigating officer.
 
 “Kamble had prepared a set of medical certificates that resemble the certificates issued by the CPR hospital. He had also made stamps and used to forge the signature of civil surgeon. We are trying to find out if more culprits are involved in providing   to government employees,” he said.
