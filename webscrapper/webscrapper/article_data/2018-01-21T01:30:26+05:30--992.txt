NEW DELHI: In a rare action, the   on Friday   a   in Delhi for not   the   at source from his  . The builder, who was defaulting on depositing the tax with the government for three years, has been sent to Tihar Jail after he ducked a non-bailable warrant issued against him by a local court when he failed to cooperate with the I-T department.

 The I-T department has already sanctioned prosecution in another 240 similar cases in Delhi alone in the last few months, according to principal chief commissioner S S Rathore. 
 
 “Deducting TDS and not depositing it in the government accounts is not only a violation of statutory obligation but also leads to harassment of innocent persons who can’t claim benefit due to non-compliance,” Rathore said. An employer or a contractor has to deposit all TDS with the government for the employees or vendors to claim tax benefits when they file returns.
 
 Rathore said the I-T department is very serious about timely deposit of TDS deductions by the employers. Any failure to deposit the tax can lead to criminal prosecution with imprisonment from three months to seven years, he added.
 
 In this case, it was found that the TDS was not deposited by the real estate company though it had deducted Rs 45.69 lakh in 2013-14, Rs 35.45 lakh in 2014-15 and Rs 33.37 lakh in 2015-16.
