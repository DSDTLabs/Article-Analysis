IDUKKI: A wild  , which got separated from its herd, entered   town, near Munnar, drawing a curious crowd on Tuesday.

 The baby elephant roamed around the town and was friendly with people. Later, Devikulam range officer   and other forest officials reached the spot and put the baby elephant in a temporary cage and gave it liquid food.
 
 On Wednesday, the calf fled to the forest, twice, but returned to the cage later. Dr  , a veterinary doctor from  , reached the spot and checked the calf to ensure it was healthy.
  
  
 
 
 “Two separate elephant herds are roaming in the area and we are trying to ascertain if it belongs to any one of them. If the calf doesn't return to the forest, we will shift it to an elephant care shelter. The five-month-old calf has no health issues," said the Devikulam range officer.
 
 “The areas adjacent to the place where the elephant calf ventured are routinely occupied by elephant herds and we hope the wild elephants will come in search of the baby jumbo,” said Kiran.
 
 Chinnakanal and Anayirankal areas are among the main man-animal conflict areas in Munnar. Elephant paths have largely been destroyed in the area, affecting the smooth movement of the wild elephants, said forest officials.
