RAKOT:   who had raped the 11-year-old daughter of his friend in Mandhiya village of Bhavnagar district on March 27. 

 The accused Gagji alias   was arrested from his native Nagalpur village near Botad early on Sunday. Six teams of   police station, local crime branch (LCB) and special operation group (SOG) were formed to nab the accused after the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with Velavadar police station on March 28. 
 
 The woman did not know his name but had given his description to the police. Jograna had come to the rape survivor’s house with her father and the duo had decided to have liquor. However, Jograna told him that he wanted to buy some curd and milk from the village and requested that his daughter accompany him as he was not familiar with the village. The man consented but Jograna took the girl to an isolated spot near a temple where he allegedly raped her. 
 
 When the girl did not return for a long time, her mother went out to search for her. When Jograna saw her, he abandoned the bike and the girl on the road and fled the spot. The girl was rushed to Bhavnagar’s Sir T Hospital where doctors confirmed that she was sexually assaulted. 
 
 Police found that the bike used in the crime was stolen from Kaduka village near Jasdan. However, they did not get much clues about him from there. The investigating teams then got his photograph from Nagalpur where he used to work as labourer. Jograna also worked as a part-time driver of truck and mini luxury buses in Rajkot. 
 
 “We made the photograph viral on social media and even announced a reward for anyone giving information about Jograna. We got specific information that Jograna would be visiting his sister in Botad and kept a watch there. We arrested him as soon as he arrived,” said H A Jadeja, police inspector, SOG.
