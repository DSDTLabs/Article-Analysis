DHARAMSHALA: Union finance minister   on Friday while addressing a ‘Tridev sammelan’ (a gathering of booth level workers) at Chambi area of district Kangra took a dig at ongoing corruption cases on HP chief minister   and said he has never seen a more established case (money laundering case which involves Singh) than this. He also countered Virbhadra’s allegations levelled against him for dragging Singh in corruption cases.

 “We hear saga of corruption cases in Delhi from Himachal. First they commit fraud and on being caught they start blaming that so and so man in Delhi is playing conspiracy against them” said Jaitely making an attack on Singh.
 
 Referring to the case, he said this case was registered in 2011 and Modi government has come to power in May 2014. “If you have succeeded in corruption management from 2011 to 2014, it doesn’t mean that every center government is going to cooperate with you in your ill deeds” he said.
 
 “There are many corruption cases going on against politicians but I have never seen such an established case in my life” Jaitely said.
 
 Further the finance minister, said that his government has provided projects to this state including railways, roads and educational institutes like a special category state on the ratio of 90:10. 
 
 “Modi government has given double in its first year of what Manmohan government had granted in last five years of its rule. But the government which is in-capable and involved in corruption cannot deliver this at ground level” he added.
