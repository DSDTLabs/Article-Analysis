JAISALMER: The 125MW Giral Lignite Thermal Power Plant (GLTPP), which was shut down three years ago, caught fire on Friday, with the fire department and other agencies failing to bring it under control even after six hours.

 The fire has spread over an area of 1km of the project site, which is 25km away from Barmer, and is now threatening to destroy the main power plant. 
 
 Electricity cables, electric wires and machinery parts have been gutted and losses may amount to lakhs of rupees. Local residents are keeping their fingers crossed as flames can be seen from a distance and smoke has engulfed the entire area.
 
 Around a dozen of fire tenders from  , Air Force and the municipal council, among others, are trying to douse the fire.
 
 If itâ€™s allowed to spread, the fire may destroy the entire Giral power project. While the reasons for the fire are not known, it may have been caused by short circuit or sludge.
 
 Barmer district collector   confirmed the fire and said that all efforts were being made to bring it under control.
 
 The tehsildar and other officers are monitoring the efforts, he said, adding that the power plant machinery was safe from the blaze.
 
 Barmer deputy SP Om   said though the fire has spread in the area, it has not reached the main plant. But the area outside the plant has been gutted and huge losses can be expected.
 
 The Rajasthan government had decided to disinvest the Giral power project as it was a loss-making unit. The plant has not been functioning for over three years due to the high quantity of sulphur in the coal. Though the plant has its own fire brigade, when the fire broke out, it was found that they had no water or other fire-fighting equipment.
