 Pune: A Pune corporator has raised a demand to extend the Vanaz-Ramwadi Metro corridor to the Lohegaon airport. 
 
 The civil work on the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor is underway. Corporator Sunil Tingre from the Ahmednagar Road-Tingrenagar area said the Metro link to the airport is missing in the plan and that thousands of flyers would benefit if it were extended.
 
 Furthermore, Tingre has demanded that the corridor be extended to Wagholi and further — till Ranjangaon — “considering the rising population along the Pune-Ahmednagar highway”.
 
 Tingre has tabled a proposal before the Pune Municipal Corporation’s city improvement committee, seeking a detailed project report for the extension to Wagholi and a connection to the airport.
 
 “The Metro service up to Ramwadi is not sufficient, as the city’s limits have already expanded to Wagholi. Lakhs of people travel daily to Wagholi and even beyond to Ranjangaon. Most travel in private vehicles due to a lack of effective public transport. These citizens should get Metro service up to Wagholi,” he said.
 
 “The airport connection will provide a direct link for thousands of flyers to the airport,” Tingre further said. 
 
 As per the existing alignment, the Metro corridor will end at Ramwadi, which is around 3km away from the airport. 
 
 There are demands to extend the Metro service to various parts of the city. MahaMetro has taken up a study to extend the Pimpri-Swargate route to Katraj.
