LUCKNOW: The   on Monday reviewed   and said that " " was the main reason for the debacle in   of Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Etah. 

 The party is on the lookout for the "black sheep", sources said. The move is being seen as an attempt to target Shivpal Yadav, known to wield influence across the Yadav land. Shivpal was not present at the meeting.
 
 The "sabotage" theory is likely to further widen the rift within the Yadav clan which is already witnessing voices of dissent, with SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav accusing his son   of humiliating him. Shivpal, who had earlier described SP's poor performance as "defeat of arrogance", has also expressed reservations over the manner in which the leadership was handling affairs in the party.
 
 "The party reviewed the performance of candidates in the Yadav stronghold and found that some leaders and workers had helped BJP candidates. The party will identify such leaders and take action against them," SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary told TOI.
 
 He said leaders and candidates from the Yadav pocket borough of Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Etah told the party chief of what had happened on ground during the elections and it was clear that some people had worked against the party candidates.
 
 Leaders close to Shivpal said this was a desperate attempt to blame him when the facts spoke otherwise. "The party leadership should review properly and take action," said a senior leader close to Shivpal, MLA from Jaswantnagar.
 
 The region, identified as the SP stronghold, stood by Mulayam, braving the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. But the 2017 assembly polls have thrown up a different picture with the SP losing nine of 14 seats in the four districts it had swept in the 2012 assembly elections.
 
 Apart from Jaswantnagar which covers the Yadav clan's village Saifai, the SP managed to retain only Kannauj (central), Mainpuri (Sadar), Kisni and Karhal. Despite being a Yadav belt, rest of the seats went to the BJP.
