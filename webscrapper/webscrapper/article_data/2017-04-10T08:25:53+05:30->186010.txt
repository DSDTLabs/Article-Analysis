NEW DELHI: Nearly a month on, a 34-year-old man was arrested for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl on Holi. The man, who worked at an eatery near the survivor’s house, told the police that he had lured her with buying   for playing  , took her to a secluded place and sexually assaulted her.

 The accused, Mantram, was waiting for a friend when he noticed the girl playing at a nearby park. He first went and sat next to her and tried to start a conversation. After making sure that nobody was watching, he asked her to accompany him to a nearby market so that he could buy her colours to play with. He made her sit in a white-coloured vehicle and drove towards a nearby vacant plot. He then gagged and sexually assaulted her.
 
 The girl’s father had lodged a missing complaint with the police at 6.30pm on March 11. He told the cops that she had gone to play outside but did not return home. He had searched the entire locality but couldn’t find her.
 
 Sometime later, the cops patrolling the area noticed the girl sitting in the corner of a road. Upon questioning her, she narrated the entire incident to them, but could not identify the accused. However, she identified the vehicle in which the man had sexually assaulted as a Gramin Sewa.
 
 “Following the girl’s statement, all such vehicles were checked. We also tried to identify the scene of crime using the landmarks told by the victim,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya.
 
 The police conducted door-to-door searched in eight localities. “The team, which included sub-inspector  , tried to identify the scene of crime. They finally identified the accused as Mantram, who worked at an eatery. His fellow workers told the police that he had not been coming for work after Holi and could not be contacted. He was arrested after raids at several locations,” Baaniya said.
