SURAT: City police commissioner   revoked ban on movement and parking of cars from   from Wednesday. However, to deal with issues of traffic congestion on the stretch police imposed ban on auto rickshaw movement during peak hours. Autos will not be allowed to ply or park on Raj Marg from 10 am to 12 noon and 5pm to 7 pm. 

 The changes were announced at a time when city traffic police is celebrating traffic week and various events are being organised to address  . 
 
 Policeâ€™s earlier move to ban cars from Raj Marg was objected by many as it led to major issues for local residents and those doing business on the road. Raj Marg being the century old market it attracts a large number of visitors from city and across south Gujarat. Being a narrow road it remains jam packed during most of the day time and   on both sides adds to the problem.
 
 In absence of efficient public transport, citizen are forced to use private vehicles that lead to chaos on road and result in heavy traffic jams. Also, number of auto rickshaws has increased in absence of public transport.
 
 Meanwhile, police received complaints of nuisance of auto rickshaws blocking Raj Marg at various points while waiting for passengers. To control the increasing menace of rickshaws, police restricted their movement.
 
 On Wednesday, police started implementation of the ban and rickshaws moving on road were forced to get off and go through optional roads.
