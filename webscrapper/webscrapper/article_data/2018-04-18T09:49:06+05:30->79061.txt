LUCKNOW: To ensure smooth implementation of the Gram  , the government has directed district magistrates, divisional commissioners and other officials from the administration to spend nights at various villages where the government is implementing the central government scheme.

 Chief minister   has instructed officials to organize chaupals across the identified villages at night and make arrangements to stay on so that they may be able to initiate dialogue with locals and inform them better about the various state and Central government schemes they can benefit from.
 
 “The idea of the ‘ratri chaupal’ or chaupal at night came about because villagers are often busy in the fields during the day. It is only at night, when they come back that officers will be able to address them collectively. Since we have been given directions to invite MPs, MLAs, and other public representatives for all the functions, even they should be spending the night at villages. However, we have so far not received any request to make arrangements for a VIP stay anywhere,” said the DM of an eastern UP city.
 
 A divisional commissioner said that for the next almost three weeks, officials would be largely occupied with this programme. “This is not all that we are expected to do but yes, it is going to take up most of our time. There is a huge list of villages that we have to go to and ensure participation in the government schemes. During the abhiyan, which started on April 14 and will continue till May 5, there are seven central government schemes and a few of the state government’s that we have to publicise and encourage people to participate in. Other than this, there are some special days that are being observed. For instance, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on April 18 during which extra activities have been planned,” he said.
