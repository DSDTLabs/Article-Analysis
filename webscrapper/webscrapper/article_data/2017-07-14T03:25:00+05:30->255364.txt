Panaji: The numerous incidents of desecration of religious structures in South Goa over the last few days is a part of an organised activity and not done for monetary gains, a senior police official said.

 “It is a racket and there is a master at whose behest it is being done,” the official, who didn’t want to be named, said.
 
 When contacted, deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Rupinder Singh said the police “are working on some leads”, but refrained from divulging how long it would take to nab the culprits.
 
 So far, not a single culprit has been caught, even as they continue to strike with impunity. Two fresh incidents of desecration of religious structures were reported in Loutolim on Thursday, wherein two crosses were vandalised.
 
 What has amazed and enraged people is that the incidents of vandalism have not stopped despite additional police deployment in South Goa.
 
 Drawing parallels between the similar incidents of vandalism reported a few years ago, the senior police officer said, “Goa Police will succeed this time.” 
 
 At that time, investigation was carried out by the crime branch and despite working on the cases for several days, it had failed to bring to light those linked to the crime even as it had made one or two arrests. No sooner did the vandalism stop, than the investigation came to an abrupt end. The officer said the crime branch had been on the right track, but stopped short of revealing why its investigation did not reach its logical conclusion.
