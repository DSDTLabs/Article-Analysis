PUNE: Officials of the state election commission have warned they would initiate stringent   officials who remain absent from   and duty without valid reasons. 

 The SEC officials have directed the returning officer to issue a showcause notice as well as register an FIR against errant officials. 
 
 State election commissioner J S Saharia told TOI, “As per election rules, the government official can face suspension besides an FIR registered against them for causing a hurdle in the implementation of the election programme.” 
 
 As per the election commission, over 1.14 lakh government officials are deployed for the ten municipal corporation elections and nearly 3 lakh employees have been reserved for the zilla parishad and panchayat samiti elections.
 
 An election official who looks after staff deployment said, “We train one lot of people, and they do not report for the next training. While some have genuine concerns, others show no interest. Even as showcause notices are issued, they do not take necessary precautions.”
 
 District collector   said, “Only differently-abled persons or pregnant women or those with some genuine personal problem have been exempted and replaced with other staff. Otherwise, we have told our ROs to initiate necessary action.”
 
 The ROs have been asked to take actions under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, under Section 134, depending on the intensity of the case.
