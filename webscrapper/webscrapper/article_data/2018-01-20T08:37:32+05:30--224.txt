PUNE: The   ( ) will start construction of the   on Shankarsheth Road after the Director General of   (DGDE) directed the board to use its own funds for the Rs 2 crore project.

 The authorities had planned to construct two overbridges for pedestrians at the Golibar Maidan intersection. The road is part of the Pune-Solapur Road leading to BT Kawade Road, Magarpatta, Hadapsar and Manjari and witnesses heavy traffic 
 
 One FOB was planned on Castellino Road and the other on Shankarsheth Road. Since the later would be costly, the board sent the proposal to DGDE for funds last year.
 
 Chief executive officer DN Yadav told the TOI, “ We got a letter from DGDE in December informing us that the project is of a small amount and directing us to carry out the work from the board’s funds. We tabled it in the general body meeting and the board members gave their consent.”
 
 Former army commander Lt Gen PM Hariz of Southern Command gave his consent for the overbridge on Shankarsheth Road. “Our design and planning is ready. We will submit the project to the newly appointed   commander Lt Gen DR Soni,” Yadav added.
 
 Cantonment board sources said any developmental work would be difficult as they have not received their share of the GST from the state government.
 
 “The state government gets about Rs 1,000 crore GST from cantonment’s traders annually. We should get our GST share from the state government. We have voiced our concerns to authorities but they have not responded as yet,” another senior official of the board said.
