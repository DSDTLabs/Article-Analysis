HYDERABAD: Bringing its outsourced workforce under the fold of the Aadhaar-based biometric attendance system has helped   save almost Rs 50 crore in one year. The system is applicable to 22,000 outsourced workers in sanitation and entomology departments who are paid wages on the basis of their work.

 Prior to the introduction of the system, touted to be the first by a civic body in the country,   spent Rs 34.64 crore on monthly salaries of outsourced workers. Now, they save between Rs 3 crore and Rs 4.5 crore every month, said officials.
 
 “Earlier, outsourced workers would register their attendance manually. This gave them a wide scope to mark themselves present on official records, despite skipping duties. We have been able to curb this malpractice to a large extent,” said a GHMC official.
 
 The system was implemented in February last year and workers’ wages were calculated on the basis of biometric attendance from April.
 
 Currently, 1,151biometric devices are installed at GHMC, 939 in sanitation and 132 more in the entomology department.
 
 “We record attendance ward-wise, at the work location, and update it from the field using GPRS. This being done twice a week,” said a GHMC spokesperson, adding, “If a worker’s attendance isn’t recorded due to a technical snag, he is paid based on a biometric online certificate issued by the assistant medical officer of health, and the deputy commissioner.”
 
 Authorities are now mulling switching over to a non-Aadhaar bio-metric attendance system, currently in use in Bangalore, as   linkage drains Rs 50-60 lakh from the civic coffer per annum. Additionally, the new system is four times faster.
 
 “A pilot project will be done in one circle of GHMC , taking into account various opinions, as well as considering multiple technological aspects. Arevised roadmap will be drafted after considering all the pros and cons,” said an official.
