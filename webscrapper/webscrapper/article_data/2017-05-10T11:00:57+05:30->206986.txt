 While the   of Braj region would be known as Mathura-Vrindavan Municipal Corporation, the one in Awadh region for the twin cities of Faizabad and   would be known as  . The name of Faizabad, thus, has been omitted.
 
 “The decision to set up municipal bodies would help in all-round development of both Mathura-Vrindavan and Ayodhya-Faizabad,” said UP government spokesperson and minister Shrikant Sharma.
 
 The nod to upgrade the two places as corporations would help in getting more funds which would mean more development, he added.
 
 Both places are a matter of deep faith for Hindus, Sharma said, adding that the upgrade of the two pilgrimages would ensure rail, road and air connectivity and strengthening of the sewage and drinking water system.
 
 As there was considerable distance between Mathura and Vrindavan, Sharma said the corporation would come up at a place convenient for residents of both cities.
