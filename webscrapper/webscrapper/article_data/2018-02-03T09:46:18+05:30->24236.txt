Newbie   composes the music for Sravan Mukesh-Varsha Bolamma starrer   and the USP of the album is youthful, romance-dripping tunes. They can’t claim much novelty, but have enough peppiness to interest us while they last.

  
  
 
 The first song is Mazhamukile by Najim Arshad and it refreshes memories of many of his songs, including Medapoopattum Chutti from Karinkunnam Sixes and Kanninnullil… from Trivandrum Lodge. Regardless, it strikes gold right at the beginning. The song moves into a different turf of longingness, from sweet romance, in the second stanza and the transition, back and forth, is interesting. Backing vocals for the portion Kurukkuthi Mulle… by Shyam Nettayikodath sweetens the song further.
 
 The immediate next Pande Nee by Siddharth Menon, is similar in tune and arrangement as the first and differs only in rhythm. The song, written by Rajeev Nair, is an interesting listen and an apt day-dreaming device for those teenaged ‘in love for the first time’ boys.
 Dulquer Salmaan is behind the mike again, this time in company of Gregory Jacob, for the third song Dhritangapulakithan. It seems to be just intended as a fun song about the trouble with ladies and that’s all it turns out to be. The lyric by Linku Abraham that goes Plingippoi Jeevitham is amusing in parts. The song suits the voice of both the actors to a T. Kunjilam Poove in a super-young and tender voice of Nia Pathiala follows. The song, for a change, has a light music feel. Nia’s voice, still developing, portrays the right amount of innocence required for the track. 
 
 Suchith Suresan wraps up the album with the title track Kalyanam. With a well-balanced Kerala wedding feel and youthfulness, it’s a vibrant song. The tune dances along well in Suchith’s voice, especially in the second stanza. The tune definitely has no freshness as mentioned before, but it’s a fun song.
