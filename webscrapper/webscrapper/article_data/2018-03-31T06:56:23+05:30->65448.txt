PANAJI: Chief Justice of India, Dipak  , has urged international commercial projects to undertake corporate social responsibility ( ) in countries hosting their businesses and to not only focus on profit maximisation. 

 “International commercial activities, with their growth, must undertake (CSR) not only in their home countries but also in nations where they have strong business footprints. Helping the host nations in alleviating their (the country’s) social problems through their economic capacity will, invariably, result in their acceptance in the host country,” the CJI was quoted as saying in a speech that was read out in his absence at the All-India Seminar on International Commercial Law, at  , on Friday, 
 
 He said India has signed a wide range of bilateral investment treaties (BIT) and there could be some specialised and customised forms of dispute resolution called investor-state arbitration. 
 
 Misra said India may also need to find ways to strengthen the working of its commercial courts, under the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act 2015, and that the establishment of more commercial courts across India may also be required.
 
 He further said India’s strategies on the dispute resolution mechanism of the  , investor-state arbitrations under BITs, and various other international commercial arbitrations have become significant now, and “perhaps much needed”.
