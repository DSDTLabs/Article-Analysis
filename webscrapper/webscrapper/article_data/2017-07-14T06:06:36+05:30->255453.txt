NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday tore into Assam CM Sarbananda   for advancing the March 31, 2018, deadline to December 31 this year for finalisation of the draft   (NRC), an important step to curb illegal migration. 

 A bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and RF Nariman had on December 17, 2014, delivered a judgment identifying four areas to tackle the problem of illegal migrants in the state which threatened its demographic structure and culture, besides causing encroachments. 
 
 The bench had ordered fencing of the border and put the Gauhati HC in charge of expeditious setting up and supervising of Foreigners' Tribunals and deportation of identified illegal migrants back to Bangladesh. It also ordered updating and publishing of the NRC. After over two years of monitoring, the bench had ordered finalisation of the draft NRC by March 31, 2018. However, on June 2, Sonowal announced the draft NRC would be published by December 31, 2017. 
 
 It was Sonowal who through his two petitions convinced the SC a decade ago that Assam faced a siege due to influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh. The SC, in two judgments, had directed the then Congress government to set up tribunals to deport illegal migrants. Ironically, Sonowal was at the wrong end of the SC's stick on Thursday in the same case. 
 
 "We have a statement of the chief minister of Assam on record that draft NRC will be published by December 31. Let him supervise the matter. We will wash our hands of this issue. When the Supreme Court is monitoring, how can someone revise the date?" it asked. "We do not appreciate any other authority interfering in the publication of draft NRC when the SC is monitoring it." 
 
 The bench then ordered, "All budgetary allocations approved be made available to fulfil the deadline of publication of draft NRC by December 31. Any difficulty or intervention will be reported to the Supreme Court."
