VADODARA:   police raided illegal sand mines on the banks of   river late Sunday night and seized five tractors. This is the second raid by cops in last one week.

 Police said that they had received a tip-off that illegal sand mining activity was going on near Chhota Udepur town. On seeing the cops, the workers fled from the spot. Assistant superintendent of police   seized five tractors and took them to Chhota Udepur police station. Sources in the police said that Sharma himself drove one of the tractors to the police station.
 
 Sharma said that it is illegal to do mining during the night hours. “Mining is banned during the night hours but anyway the place that we raided was out of the mining lease area,” said Sharma. He added that around three days back he had raided another illegal mining place near   on the banks of Orsang river.
 
 Cops had seized two digging machines and six trucks from there. Sharma said that the mining branch of the district administration is responsible for taking action against illegal miners. “After the raids and seizure, we have sent a letter to the department. We will register an FIR after they will find anything wrong in it,” he said.
 
 Illegal sand mining from Orsang river is a big menace in Chhota Udepur. The miners dig out several tonnes of sand during the night hours and transport them to Madhya Pradesh in trucks and tractors. Residents have made several representations to the administration but no action have been taken so far.
