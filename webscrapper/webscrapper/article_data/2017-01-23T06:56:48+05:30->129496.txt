SURAT: After a long time,   fliers will be able to fly at the airfares existing at bigger airports like Ahmedabad and Mumbai. 

 A price war has started after   announced launch of its daily flight services between Surat and Delhi from March 26. 
 
 According to tour and travel operators in the city, who are taking advance bookings for their customers, after SpiceJet’s announcement, the lone operator at Surat airport,   has slashed its base airfare on Surat-Delhi sector below Rs 4,000 as the private airline is offering tickets for Rs 2,500. 
 
 The tour operators said Indigo, operating on   sector, too slashed its one-way base airfare from Rs 2,900 to Rs 2,180 to attract the domestic travellers from Surat and nearby areas. 
 
 Sources said reduction in airfares is all set to provide an edge to Surat airport and that passengers will prefer travelling from Surat instead of Vadodara. 
 
 “Due to Air India charging exorbitant airfares on Surat-Delhi sector, most of our customers preferred travelling from Vadodara airport. It takes around three hours to reach Vadodara by road and that the customers can board the flights for as low as Rs 3,000. Now, with SpiceJet restarting its services from Surat, the airfares have been slashed like never before,” said Sajid Patel, a tour operator. 
 
 ‘Member of We Want Working A Working Airport at Surat’ Sanjay Jain said, “The AI flights were getting over 95 per cent passenger traffic even while charging hefty airfares. Now, I think both airlines will have to run extra flights to cater to the rush of passengers after price reduction.” 
 
 Sources said SpiceJet plans to operate four daily flights on Surat-Delhi sector from March 26. 
 
 Sanjay Ezhawa, president,  , said, “The increased passenger flow due to slashed airfares will attract more private airlines to start operations for other destinations from here.”
