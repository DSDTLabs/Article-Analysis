PATNA: Former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi’s elder son   exchanged rings with   Rai, the daughter of former minister  , at a posh city hotel on Wednesday. Aishwarya is the granddaughter of former CM Daroga Rai. 

 Tej Pratap, who celebrated his 29th birthday on Monday, was in a royal blue suit and Aishwarya (25) was in turquoise sparkling attire with golden embroidery. The two fulfilled all rituals and cut a cake in the presence of their family members, close relatives and friends.
 
 Nearly 150 guests attended the ring ceremony. The venue was adorned with flowers, gobo flashlights and white ribbons hanging from the ceiling. According to sources, the menu was simple and pure vegetarian.
 
 A beaming Rabri was busy in necessary chores while her younger son and former deputy CM   attended the guests.
 
 Talking to media persons, Rabri said, “It is a happy occasion for the family as my son has got engaged. But we are also feeling the absence of Lalu ji. This is the first big ceremony in the family in his absence.”
 
 Later, Tej Pratap tweeted, “Miss you PAPA”, with a sad smiley.
 
 While Lalu could not make it to the ceremony as he is in jail after his conviction in fodder scam cases and is currently undergoing treatment at AIIMS in New Delhi, his estranged relatives, including Tej’s maternal uncles Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav, were conspicuous by their absence.
 
 The marriage would be solemnized on May 12 at the veterinary college ground in the city.
 
 Sources said the marriage of Tej and Aishwarya was finalized in March by Rabri following consultations with Chandrika and his wife Poornima Rai, who is an assistant professor in Patna Women’s College.
 
 Aishwarya had done her schooling from Notre Dame Academy in Patna and graduation from Miranda House in Delhi before completing her MBA from Amity University, Delhi.
