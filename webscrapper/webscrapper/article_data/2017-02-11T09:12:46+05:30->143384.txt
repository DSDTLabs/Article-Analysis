NEW DELHI: Don't be surprised if you receive a call from   asking whether any one in your family or from village practises  .

TOI has learned that the selected numbers will first get an   informing them that they will receive a call from Bachchan. After brief introduction, the Bollywood superstar will ask two questions â€” one if anyone of the receiver's family practices open defecation and the other whether anyone in the village does so. The receivers will only need to press 1 for 'yes' and 2 for 'no'.
 
 They can also record their success stories in curbing the practice by calling a toll free number (040-71317131).
 
 Sanitation secretary Parameswaran Iyer said they have already engaged national level monitors to verify the ODF status of villages and soon a third party entity will be tasked to carry out independent assessment.
 
 Officials said while toilet coverage has increased substantially from nearly 48% to 61% since Swachh Bharat Mission was launched, poor toilet coverage in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is a cause of concern. The share of people practicing open defecation in these two states comprises 36% of country's total population who defecate in the open.
 
 "Both Centre and states are taking several steps together to push toilet construction and trigger behaviour change. We are working on increasing the number of motivators in these two states who can engage with people to bring the change," said an official.
