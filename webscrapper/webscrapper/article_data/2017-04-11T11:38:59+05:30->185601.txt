PUNE: Citizens can breathe easily now as they will not have to pay a higher   in the current financial year. 

 The standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation ( ) on Monday rejected a proposal to hike taxes. 
 
 In the annual civic budget, municipal commissioner Kunal   had proposed a 12% hike on property tax and a 15% increase in water tax.
 
 The proposed hike was discussed during the standing committee meeting. As per civic officials, the administration had pushed for a hike, saying that it is needed to speed up civic projects. They demanded that at least a 5% hike be allowed, but the committee rejected it. 
 
 “Members across party lines were in favour of rejecting the proposal,” said Muralidhar Mohol, standing committee chairman. “They felt the hike could not be justified, and that citizens should not been asked to pay higher tax,” he said.
 
 The civic administration had hoped to mop up an additional revenue of Rs 118 crore from the proposed hikes — Rs 89 crore from property taxes and Rs29 crore from water taxes.
 
 “Revenue can be generated through other sources too, and not just by increasing taxes,” said Shreenath Bhimale, BJP’s leader in PMC. “The administration has to make the efforts to recovering dues from defaulters. It was also one of the reasons why we decided not to support the tax hike,” Bhimale added.
 
 Civic commissioner Kumar had presented the budget in March. The Rs 5,600 crore budget for 2017-18 was the highest ever presented by a Pune municipal commissioner. Last year, a budget of Rs 5,199 crore was tabled.
