GREATER NOIDA: The   has agreed to hand over 57 hectares to the   for a cloverleaf at the interchange where the Eastern Peripheral   crosses over the  , in an attempt to provide maximum connectivity to the proposed airport at Jewar.

 The land is required by the   for constructing the interchange at kilometre 9 on the Yamuna Expressway. A cloverleaf interchange is a two-level interchange in which left turns are handled by ramp roads. 
 
 According to officials, the land has been identified at Jaganpur-Afzalpur area and is expected to cost YEIDA Rs 161 crore. YEIDA had so far not agreed to give the land to the NHAI for free, saying it had acquired it from farmers after paying them an additional compensation of 64.7%. In an attempt to break the impasse, YEIDA chairman Prabhat Kumar had in November last year directed that the land be re-evaluated.
 
 “The YEIDA board has now given the go-ahead for handing over the land required to connect the two e-ways,” Kumar said. “However, it will be given on the condition that the NHAI will have to bear any additional cost.” 
 
 “The aim is to provide maximum connectivity to the upcoming airport at Jewar from numerous places in the NCR. We also intend to provide access to our allottees,” he said. “We will rope in the concessionaire for pooling in resources.”
 
 The EPE project has been envisaged to facilitate a smooth ride in the cities of Ghaziabad,  , Sonipat, Faridabad and Palwal, as well as to de-congest Delhi’s roads. Once complete, it is likely to take at least 70,000-80,000 vehicles off the Delhi roads. It is also likely to benefit Uttar Pradesh and Haryana by opening up hinterlands for developing commercial areas and townships along the expressways.
