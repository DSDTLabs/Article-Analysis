NOIDA: The five   on the central verge of   near Atta market, which were cemented and closed on Thursday night, were found destroyed on Friday morning with bricks and construction material strewn around. The five cuts allowed people to move from Sector 18 market to   and vice-versa. These cuts were closed as they posed a threat to pedestrians.

 According to officials, in a meeting presided over by   CEO in November last year, it was decided that the five cuts opposite Atta market and the two cuts near   metro station shall be closed. Subsequently, the two cuts near City Centre metro station were closed and on Thursday, the five near Atta market were closed.
 
 However, on Friday morning, two of the cuts were found destroyed with construction material strewn around. At the three other cuts which were closed, pedestrians could be seen scurrying over the central verge as there was no metallic grill.
 
 “People who are used to using the cuts to move from Atta market to Sector 18 market and vice-versa must have started using the cuts again, leading to the cement coming off. The people in Atta market do not want the cuts to be closed,” said a security guard of a nearby hotel.
 
 Sushil Jain, president of the Sector 18 market association, said the association had no role in the issue and people behind it were most likely from the Atta market.
 
 CB Jha, president, Atta market association, denied involvement of shopkeepers but said the Authority did not inform them before closing the cuts. “We have requested the Authority for a subway from Sector 18 to Atta market but it is not ready to help us even though it is spending crores for Sector 18,” he said.
 
 The police have attributed the incident to the continuous friction between the Sector 18 market association and the shopkeepers from Atta market.
 
 “This is the result of an ongoing feud between the two parties,” SP (traffic) Anil Jha said.
