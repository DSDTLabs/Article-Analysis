 Agra: Employees of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University continued their strike for the 15th day on Friday. Things have literally come to a standstill in various departments of the university and this is causing a great deal of inconvenience to students. Earlier, vice chancellor Arvind Dixit had said that results for all courses (2016-17batch) will be out by June end. However, the strike has led to a delay in declaration and not even 50% of results have been announced till date.    Last month, three employees were suspended by the university administration for alleged negligence while discharging duty. Soon after the development, the employees’ association began strike and demanded that the suspension order should be revoked.    University spokesperson GS Sharma said, “The colleges are responsible for delay in declaration of results. We have issued notices to some of the colleges. All results will be out soon.”    On Friday, university registrar KN Singh appealed to the employees to resume work from Saturday for the sake of students’ interest.
