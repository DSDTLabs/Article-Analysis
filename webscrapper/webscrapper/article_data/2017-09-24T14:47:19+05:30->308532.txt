 Asked if Twinkle - known for her sense of humour - will ever write a comedy film, Akshay said in an interview, "She takes it slowly. She is not like me who will do four films a year or so. She is happy at the moment associating with films in her own way and pace." 
 
 Akshay said the Indian audience today needs a dose of laughter to cope with stress. "I want to make people laugh. India needs to laugh. India has the right to laugh a lot as everyone is bored of reading sad news in the papers. Rarely do we see good stories," he said. 
 
 The actor said although he likes having a good laugh, it is in bad taste if done at the expense of others. "There is a line that I have set for myself. Like when I hosted shows, I made sure I didn't make fun of others. I made fun of myself. I feel comedy is all about making fun of yourself and making people laugh."
 
 "I follow  . (But) there are other kind of people, including comedians, who joke about others, and it is their way of doing comedy," he said.
