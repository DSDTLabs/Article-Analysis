NEW DELHI: Defence Minister   said the   is fully prepared for any eventuality and enjoys a dominance near the Line of Control, asserting that Pakistan will have to pay a price for acts of mutilation of Indian soldiers. 

 "Our forces are ready. I cannot disclose all the details. Our borders and the line of control is fully secure and the army's only priority now is clear that they will not allow any infiltration. Daily infiltration attempts are made and our forces have to take action," Jaitley said at a panel discussion on TV. 
 
 His comments came in response to a question whether a war with Pakistan was a possibility given the heightening of tensions in the past few months
 
 "On the LoC and the border our forces have a domination. I don't think there is any need to announce everything but we have domination and to prevent any infiltration, necessary steps are being taken by the army. Pakistan which has indulged in mutilation and others acts will have to pay a price for these," he said.
 
 Tension between the two countries have heightened in recent months after the mutilation of two Indian soldiers.
 
 India has cranked up military pressure along the 778-km LoC with "punitive fire assaults" against Pakistan army posts and terror launch pads, which have become fiercer after the beheading of two army jawans in the   sector on May 1.
 
 A short video clip of one such assault with weapons being used in "direct firing mode" in   sector on May 9, which ostensibly shows some forward observation posts of the Pakistan army being blown up across the LoC, was released by the Army's additional director-general of public information, Major General A K Narula.
 
 The Army had that targeted fire as saults, with light field guns, anti-tank guided missiles, heavy mortars, rocket launchers and "infantry tanks", are being conducted to "proactively dominate" the LOC and "destroy locations aiding infiltration of terrorists" as part of the overall counter-terrorism strategy.
