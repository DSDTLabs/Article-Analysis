TUTICORIN: Following the black flag protest announced by DMK and its allies, chief minister   has agreed to inaugurate a portion of the second drinking water supply scheme for Kovilpatti town and also lay the foundation stone for various works on Friday. The protest was dropped after an assurance by the district administration to complete the pending works on the multi crore project.

 As the first water supply scheme for Kovilpatti was inadequate to meet the needs of the growing population, the second drinking water supply scheme was proposed. Then chief minister   laid the foundation stone for the second scheme to be completed at an outlay of Rs 81 crore.
 
 Water for the scheme will be drawn from   and to Kovilpatti using pipelines. The work has been progressing at a snailâ€™s pace and was not completed as the pipes have been laid from Sivalaperi to the town but are yet to reach the streets. On the other hand only seven of the 10 overhead water tanks for the project have been completed. At this juncture the CM was scheduled to inaugurate the scheme on Friday.
 
 The announcement for the event by local minister Kadambur C Raju attracted strong opposition from DMK and its allies, who warned to wave black flags at the CM during his visit. Revenue officials conducted a peace meeting with the political parties and assured to complete the construction of the remaining three tanks in the next few months and complete the pipeline laying works within a year.
 
 Following assurances the black flag protest was called off. The government invitation for the event has also been printed that the CM will lay the foundation stone for projects that are part of the Kovilpatti Municipality second pipeline works, lay the foundation stone for various works and distribute assistance and benefits to beneficiaries under various schemes. tnn
