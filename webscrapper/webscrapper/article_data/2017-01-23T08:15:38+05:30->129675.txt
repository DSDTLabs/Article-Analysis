NEW DELHI: The man who allegedly made a ransom call to   student   Ahmed’s family was sent to police custody for seven days on Sunday after cops said they needed to interrogate Shameem to determine if he really abducted Najeeb or knew about any such plot. 

 The police are also looking for Shameem’s brother and going through their call records. Shameem (19) had allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh for release of Najeeb. The police have recovered the phone and the SIM card from which he allegedly made the calls. At least four SIM cards, procured on fake identities, were also found on him. Joint commissioner (crime)   said a special team had been formed to look into the matter. 
 
 Shameem, who was earlier jailed in Uttar Pradesh in a murder case, has denied having   Najeeb and said he was just trying to make money after hearing that the family had declared a reward of Rs 10 lakh for information on their   son, the police said. 
 
 The crime branch tracked down Shameem to Maharajganj in UP and arrested him on Saturday evening. He initially claimed to be Shiv Kumar before the police team.
 
 Prior to Shameem’s calls, the family had received a letter from a woman from Aligarh who claimed to have spotted Najeeb in a market. A person from Bihar also claimed to have spotted him.
 
 According to the sequence established till now, Najeeb, who was on medication for severe depression, had a brawl with some students who were ABVP members on October 14 night. His mother was informed and she reached Delhi the next day but found him missing. During the probe, the police got to know from an auto driver that Najeeb told him to go to Batla House in Jamia Nagar from JNU but got down at the main gate of Jamia Milia University in the same area.
 
 The crime branch has scanned the entire JNU campus using dog squads and the mount police but could not find any clue. The police have declared a reward of Rs 10 lakh for any information on the missing student.
