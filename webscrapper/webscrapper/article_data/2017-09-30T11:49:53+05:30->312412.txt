PUNE: The heavy rain accompanied by thunder on Friday afternoon uprooted 16 electric poles in Hadapsar and Magarpatta area affecting power supply to over 22,000 consumers. 

 Most of the affected area were backfed through alternative sources by evening and repairs are on, a statement issued by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd said.
 
 Four 22 KV overhead supply lines from the 22 KV Henley sun station in Hadapsar supply electricity to Hadapsar gaon, Hadapsar market, Sadesataranali, Satavwadi, Shindevasti, Ramtekdi, Solapur, Magarpatta and B T Kawade roads. The storm and heavy rains that started around 2pm led to uprooting of trees and branches which fell on the four supply lines at several places. As many as 16 poles got uprooted as a result.
 
 The distribution company said work to reinstall the poles has started and is expected to be completed in two days. 
 
 â€œThe respective areas are being backfed but if the load cannot be managed, load shedding lasting two to three hours may be enforced in Hadapsar, Solapur Road, Magarpatta and Ramtekdi areas by rotation. Around 55 engineers and technical staff are involved in the repairs, the statement said.
 
 There was power failure in some areas like Shivajinagar, Rasta Peth and Pimpri divisions of the distribution company because of trees and hoardings falling on supply lines due to the storm and rains. 
 
 Power supply to the affected areas like Fatimanagar, Shinde Chhatri, NIBM road, Lullanagar, Raheja garden, Kondhwa, Baner, balewadi, Pashan, Wakad road, Kaspate Vasti, Jagtap dairy,   and Tathawade was restored by late evening.
