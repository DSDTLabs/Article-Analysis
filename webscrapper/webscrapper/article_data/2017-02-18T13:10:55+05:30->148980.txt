IMPHAL: With severe shortage of funds and manpower,  's party   ( ) has taken to online crowdfunding to raise funds and campaigning on cycle to reach out to the masses.

 PRJA is the first regional party in Manipur which has resorted to crowdfunding to finance the poll expenses in the state.
 
 According to PRJA sources, online crowdfunding with the slogan 'Ten For a Change' is aimed at involving more people, bringing transparency in election funding and reaching out to the masses.
 
 The PRJA has so far collected Rs 4.5 lakh through the initiative.
 
 "The online crowdfunding is in line with the party's call for accountable governance. When we started the party there was a lot of need for funds. Online funds are transparent and normally political parties face a backlash because they don't have transparency in their funds," PRJA's convener   said.
 
 "We want to play a positive part in the politics of India, that's why we launched the crowd funding. From the beginning itself every single rupee is accounted for and we know who has donated it unlike others who don't disclose majority of their fund sources," he added.
 
 Irom Sharmila, while talking about the idea of online crowdfunding, said, "Online crowd-fund is also aimed at ending muscle and money power in elections. Our aim is to change the system for a better Manipur."
 
 Erendo further said, "The iconic stature and acceptance of Irom across the country has helped the party in organising this programme."
