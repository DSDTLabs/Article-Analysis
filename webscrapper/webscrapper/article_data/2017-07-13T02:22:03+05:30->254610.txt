NAVI MUMBAI: Thousands of litres of drinking   was wasted due to a pipeline   in   node’s Talvali area on Wednesday.

 The sub-supply line with 15-inch diamater runs adjacent to Thane-Belapur road. Although the leak was fixed in two hours, residents complained of disruption in supply in the morning. 
 
  The intersection connecting the sub-pipe to the main   was ruptured during cleaning. The engineering department was informed of the leak by the local residents.
 
 “The taps ran dry in the morning because of the leakage. This is the first time that we have suffered such a major burst in the underground line, which created panic among the locals. Although the problem was attended, we had to suffer because of a disruption in supply,” said Shantaram Gaikwad, a resident.
 
 According to   executive engineer  , “The leak in the sub-pipe line occurred during cleaning activity inside the nullah. But our workforce fixed the burst in just two hours. We deployed adequate manpower to avert further loss of precious resource. The supply was restored soon after.”
