AHMEDABAD: The   to open spaces has moved into its next stage. On Monday,   will embark on a 5-km rally that will pass by four major schools which are yet to provide access to their large playgrounds to local residents. It’s been more than a month since Bodakdev residents began protesting to gain access to the   (AUDA) playground being used by Nirma school. The association members have stuck posters, distributed flyers in residential society along the rally route, asking citizens to join the peaceful march.

 The rally will begin from Bodakdev, Sandesh Press road, Prakash school, near Vastrapur lake, and then it will turn right towards Mansi Circle. 
 
 “The aim of the peaceful rally is to make citizens aware that the large playgrounds enclosed by the schools is actually public space and were allotted by AUDA under the condition that the playgrounds will be available to nearby residents during non-school hours,” says Bodakdev residents’ association member Shailesh Maheshwari. The protest will be joined by senior AAP leader Kannu Kalsaria. 
 
 Members of residential societies like Indraprastha, Goyal Park, Pushpraj Bungalows, Samprat Apartments, Galaxy Apartments, Prathishtha, Panchamrut and 20 other societies in the area will join a meeting on Sunday to chalk out a plan of action.
