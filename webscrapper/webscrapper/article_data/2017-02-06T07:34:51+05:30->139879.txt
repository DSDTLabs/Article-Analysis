BENGALURU: K Srinivas, history-sheeter and president of Dasanapura APMC, may have been shot at by two pistols on Friday, investigators said. Two bikeborne men opened fire at Srinivas, alias   alias Dhaba Seena, while he was travelling in his white Honda City car near Kogilu Cross on Ballari Road, leading to the aiport. 

 The ballistics report is awaited, which could give clear picture on how many bullets were fired by the attackers. However, police commissioner Praveen Sood said looking at the number of bullets fired, both the rider and the pillion of the black Pulsar motorcycle could have opened fire at the car.
 
 Investigation into the case is under way in coordination with officers of the central range. Even though the shooting took place in Bengaluru city, the roots of the attack lie in Nelamangala and areas straddling Tumakuru Road and Magadi Road, where Seena had earned notoriety and wielded political clout.
 
 Srinivas was allegedly a rowdy sheeter before he forayed into politics. Thirteen cases, including that of murder, rioting and intimidation, have been filed against him.
 
 Sources said police, who are investigating a possible case of supari, have detained more than 25 men from Nelamangala, Dasanapura and Devanahalli. Seena's brother, Poison Rama, also a rowdy-sheeter, has been taken into custody for questioning.
 
 Srinivas, who is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Hebbal, is yet to gain complete consciousness. To prevent untoward incidents, security has been beefed up in the area.
