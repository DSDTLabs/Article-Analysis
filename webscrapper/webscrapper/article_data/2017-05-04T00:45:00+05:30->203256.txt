Mangaluru: Although the prison manual mentions three categories of prisoners like A, B and C, the state prisons department treats all jail inmates – under trials and convicts – equally and does not adhere to the same, asserted H N S Rao, DGP (Prisons). 

 The prisons department strictly goes by the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Mandela Rules) and makes no exception for anyone including high-profile political prisoners.
 
 Making this observation over reports of preferential treatment given to   general secretary V K  , undergoing prison term following her conviction in the disproportionate assets case at Parappana Agrahara, Rao told reporters here that the prisons department has stopped following the prisoner categorization decades ago. “Sasikala is being treated as such by the jail authorities without any preference,” he said.
 
 The chief superintendent at Parappana Agrahara is empowered to deal with any minimal additional requirements that a prisoner may need in view of their health condition, if any, he said, adding when Sasikala’s counsel sought certain facilities, the court left it to the discretion of the prisons department and norms prescribed in the jail manual. He scotched reports that Sasikala had been given AC, water heating facilities and other such luxuries. “She is in a prison,” he said.
 
 About reports that she is getting more than her fair share of visitors in violation of norms laid down in the jail manual, Rao said, “Sasikala was in that phase of her incarceration when it is natural for a convict to be met by their near and dear ones. Given her status prior to conviction, it was only natural that political leaders (from neighbouring Tamil Nadu) and her legal counsel met her at the jail and all this was very much within norms as permitted by the authorities,” he said.
