NEW DELHI Lieutenant governor Anil   has asked the   (DMRC) to come up with a proposal to build a skywalk connecting the   metro station with Patparganj Industrial Area, after conducting a survey of the area. Baijal told   to create a skywalk if it's feasible or suggest an alternative solution for smoother movement of pedestrians. 

 The direction to DMRC was among the measures suggested by Baijal on Saturday, during an inspection of the Anand Vihar Inter-State Bus Terminal. Baijal reviewed issues related to traffic, parking, encroachment and sanitation in the area and directed different government agencies to take short and long term measures with deadlines.
