KOLKATA: An emergency surgery by doctors at a   saved a toddler’s life, after physicians at another state facility apparently failed to correctly read the situation. The year-and-a-half-old child had swallowed a piece of   that got lodged at the entrance of the wind pipe and nearly choked him to death. 

 Alfaz Khan was having potato chips at home on Tuesday, when he swallowed the piece of plastic. But unaware, his parents, Kajal Biwi and Amirul Khan, could not fathom why he was suddenly having difficulty breathing. When Kajal put her finger in his mouth, she felt the edge of the plastic but could not pull it out. The couple took the child to Chittaranjan   near Hazra where they were sent to the OPD. Doctors there allegedly said the child had chest congestion, nebulised him, gave medicine for cold and discharged him. Alfaz again had difficulty breathing at night. 
 
 The next morning, the Khans took Alfaz back to Sishu Sadan. “We told the doctors something was lodged in his throat but they denied it and treated him with medicine and oxygen at the OPD. They also told us we could take him to   if his condition relapsed,” alleged grandfather Salam Ali Khan.
 
 Back home, as the child turned blue, the family took him to SSKM that night. On checking, ENT doctors at the emergency found a red plastic sheet near Alfaz’s vocal cord and immediately operated on him. “The plastic was stuck below the vocal cord at the sub-glottic region. Around 1am, we conducted bronchostomy, a micro-surgery to remove the plastic piece. Any delay could have cost him his life,” said Dr Arunabha Sengupta, ENT head at SSKM. 
 
 Sishu Sadan administration has ordered a probe.
