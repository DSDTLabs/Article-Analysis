BENGALURU: Is   president G Parameshwara pitching for dissident JD(S) MLA B Z   Ahmed Khan — who is yet to join the party — to fill the vacuum of Muslim leadership in the  , considering former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has said his party will have a Muslim as the dyCM if it comes to power on its own?

 Khan and six other JD(S) MLAs will be joining the Congress in the presence of party president   in Bengaluru on February 26. According to Congress sources, Khan will be projected as an influential Muslim leader. All the seven JD(S) MLAs have been reportedly guaranteed a ticket from the respective constituencies they were elected in 2013.
 
 Khan, who’s close to chief minister Siddaramaiah, said he also enjoyed the confidence of Parameshwara, who praised him at a party rally in Koratagere, Tumakuru, on Thursday.
 
 “At the rally, Parameshwara said while Muslim leaders like Azeez Sait were no more and C K   had aged, the Congress rank and file still had tall Muslim leaders. But now, perhaps the most trusted name in the community and within the Congress is Khan,” he said quoting the KPCC chief.
 
 Khan, who has been working out a poll strategy to contest from Chamarajapet again on a Congress ticket, said the polarisation of votes in the Uttar Pradesh polls would benefit him in the upcoming Karnataka elections.
 
 “The Muslim population in the country feels that Congress is the only party they can bank upon, for a peaceful existence. Even if I had remained in JD (S) and contested on their ticket, I wouldn’t have got the Muslim votes. In a way, God has paved the way for me to join Congress,” he said.
