PATNA: Although Holi, the festival of colour, will be celebrated on March 2 this year, priests have cautioned people against performing ‘Holika Dahan’ between 7.53am and 6.58pm on March 1 when ‘bhadra’ will prevail. “Bhadra will prevail during first half of Purnima on March 1 and all auspicious work should be avoided during this period,” said a city-based priest.

 “As per the Kashi (Banaras) panchaang, ‘bhadra’ will begin at 7.53am on March 1 and conclude at 6.58pm.   can be done only after this period. Choosing the right ‘muhurta’ is very important,” said Pandit Ashutosh Kumar Vajpayee. 
 
 Acharya Sampoornanand also suggested people to wait till ‘bhadra’ gets over. “Though ‘bhadra’ will be over at 6.58pm on March 1, this is the timing for Varanasi. For other cities, there will be slight change in the timing depending on their latitude and longitude and moon’s rise. For Patna, ‘bhadra’ will be over 10 minutes before Varanasi.” 
 
 However, for those following the Mithila panchaang, ‘bhadra’ will begin at 8.05am on March 1 and end at 7:11pm. 
 
 Bhavanath Jha of Mahavir Mandir said, “There is slight difference in the timing of ‘bhadra’ depending on the region and it is advisable to do ‘Holika Dahan’ after 7:20pm.” “Ideally, the ritual should be done before midnight,” he added. 
 
 March 2, however, is considered auspicious as it marks ‘Siddhi Yog’. According to astrologers, the ‘Siddhi Yog’ will bring peace and prosperity in the society.
 
 Soon after Holi, Chaitra Navaratri will begin on March 18 and conclude on March 25, when Ram Navami will be observed. This will be followed by Mahavir Jayanti on March 29 and Hanuman Jayanti on March 31.
