NEW DELHI: Police arrested   Aryan Sharma on Saturday, a member of notorious carjacker Manoj Bakkarwala’s gang. The gang was committing carjackings one after another in south and  .

 Police have recovered cars like Toyota Fortuners, Hyundai i-20 sportz, Opel Corsa and a Hyundai Santro from Sharma and the gang’s kingpin, Ratan Chopra, who was arrested on January 22.
 
 “A team led by ACP operations, Rajinder Singh and inspector AATS Raj Kumar was formed to track down the gang after a number of incidents were reported from parts of south and southwest Delhi,” said DCP southwest, Surender Kumar.
 
 Their associates Ajay Verma, Anshu Singh and Ankush were arrested from Barthal Chowk near Dwarka Sector 28 on January 22 along with Chopra, while they were trying to rob a car. The police team which was already tracking the gang’s movements chased the youths and caught them, following which they revealed Sharma’s location, who had fled when they had seen police.
 
 Chopra was found wearing a gold ring the gang had robbed from a man a few days back. He was also carrying a country-made pistol along with two rounds.
 
 Sharma told police that he fell in bad company since he required quick money for some modeling assignments as he was preparing to contest for Mr India. He had later started committing consecutive robberies to earn more. He came in contact with Chopra who introduced him to Bakkarwala in jail and inducted him into the gang.
 
 It was found that Ankush, Ajay and Anshu were school dropouts who were recruited by Chopra for the ground work.
