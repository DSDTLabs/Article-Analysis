BENGALURU: Procuring an Aadhaar card as proof of identity (PoI) to secure access to bank accounts and statefunded benefits is not difficult, considering that   (UIDAI) allows citizens to pick from a list of 35 documents which can be submitted as proof of address (PoA) and 18 documents as PoI. But what if the PoI and PoA are faked to obtain Aadhaar?

 As the   government makes Aadhaar mandatory for availing benefits and services, questions arise on how authentic the documentation is. Take the case of  , who procured Aadhaar by providing her voter ID (Byatarayanapura constituency). However, the ID was allegedly faked by Das and was cancelled by BBMP after an investigation was launched into a complaint lodged against the applicant. On February 7, UIDAI issued an Aadhaar card to Das and mailed the same to the address in Tatanagar, Kodigehalli. However, the card landed at the house of Abhishek (name changed) who was surprised to find that it was issued in Das’ name despite no such person ever having lived at his house. Abhishek also has an Aadhaar in his name with the same address.
 After he submitted a complaint to UIDAI, a spokesperson responded: “It was found on verification that Mamata Das, D/o Biamal Mandal, enrolled for Aadhaar, which was issued to her on 07.02.2017. She produced her Election Photo Identity Card (EPIC) issued on 19.04.2013 as a proof of identity/proof of address during the enrolment process. Preliminary verification revealed that Das’ EPIC card is genuine.”
 
 However, BBMP special commissioner (elections)   said their investigation report found that Das never lived in the complainant’s house and that her name was being struck off the voters’ list. The report said the person was in fact residing at the said location when the building was under construction and later moved to another part of Byatarayanapura constituency. UIDAI clarified that Aadhaar once issued is not invalidated for the want of update.
