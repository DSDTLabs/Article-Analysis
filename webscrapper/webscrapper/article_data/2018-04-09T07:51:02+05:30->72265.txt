PUNE: Unidentified intruders stole a .32 non-prohibited bore (NPB) revolver and 10 live cartridges from the bungalow of a retired Indian Air Force (IAF) officer at   sometime over the last week. 

 The 72-year-old ailing wing commander and his wife live in the bungalow, which had been locked for the last one week as he was admitted to a hospital for treatment. His wife had accompanied him to the hospital, police said. The theft came to light when the couple returned home on Saturday evening.
 
 Senior inspector   and inspector   visited the spot. The IAF veteran, who retired from service in 1993, later lodged a complaint with the Airport police. 
 
 An officer with the Airport police said, “The thieves collected only the revolver and cartridges from a briefcase that was placed in a cupboard in the house but did not touch any other article, including valuables and cash kept in another room.” 
 
 Sonde told TOI that the retired officer had been admitted to a private hospital in   after he was diagnosed with a lung infection. His wife, also aged 72, was present with him in the hospital room. Before shifting to the hospital, on March 30, the couple had locked their bungalow. After taking discharge from the hospital, the elderly couple reached their residence on Saturday evening. The gate of the fence was locked. However, the locks on the entrance of the bungalow were broken,   explained.
 
 “The couple then inspected the rooms and found that somebody had broken the locks of the cupboard and safe. The briefcase, containing the firearm and cartridges, was lying open on the bed and the revolver and cartridges were missing. The veteran officer’s service medals were scattered around the bedroom,” said Sonde. The license of the .32 revolver had expired on Friday. The veteran officer had not renewed it as he wanted to sell the weapon, Sonde said.
