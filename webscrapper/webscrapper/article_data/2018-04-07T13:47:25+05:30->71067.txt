HYDERABAD: On the 132nd birth anniversary of Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan, on Wednesday,   enthusiasts and city historians renewed efforts to remove the misunderstanding surrounding him and bring back the aura and glory associated with his 37-year regime.

 Several prayer meetings were held and photographs showcasing the development during the Nizam’s rule were put on display to mark the birth anniversary. A demand for installation of Osman Ali Khan’s statues in Osmania University, KBR Park and Osmania Hospital was also put forth. Many heritage enthusiasts joined the celebrations and urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to declare official holiday on April 6 every year.
 
 The family of the Nizam also came out with a list demands which included introduction of a lesson on Mir Osman Ali Khan in school curriculum. The demand gains significance in the backdrop of the fact that Osman Ali Khan is perhaps the only 20th century ruler in India to be despised, while heads of other princely states got official recognition. Videos and photographs showcasing the contributions of the Nizam were released on social media to remove the stigma attached to him.
 
 Heritage and Telangana activists Dr   and Captain Lingala Panduranga Reddy led the homage at the Nizam’s grave in   in King Koti. Nizam’s grandson Nawab Najaf Ali Khan and social activists M Satyanarayana, D Naresh, Ajay Kumar and others were also present.
 
 “Unfortunately, Hindutva forces-led by   and supported by Andhra Communist leaders and other political parties have started a vehement campaign against the Nizam because he was a Muslim,” said Dr Chiranjeevi. Members of the Deccan Democratic and Secular Alliance, Voice of Telangana and 1969 Telangana Udhyamakarula Samakhya conducted prayers meetings. The Nizam was also remembered in Osmania University and Telugu University. Telangana Muslim Advocates’ Forum president   demanded that a general holiday be declared on April 6.
