LUCKNOW: While the 2019   elections are still two years away,   has set the ball rolling in the party. Shah has shortlisted around 120   in the country where the   has never won the election, and has deputed 35 leaders to prepare a winning ground on these seats. 

 The leaders have been given two main tasks — one, find out why BJP lost these seats in 2014 despite the Modi wave. Second, frame the strategy to win them in 2019. 
 
 The BJP chief has selected 35 leaders who are adept in organisational matters and have a long experience in framing winnable strategies.
 
 Three ministers from UP quota are also among the chosen 35. They are UP ministers Mahendra Singh and Swatantra Deo Singh, and Union minister Manoj Sinha, the MP from Ghazipur. 
 
 Sinha, minister of state for railways, has been assigned five Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal. 
 
 Swatantra Deo Singh has been allotted five Lok Sabha seats of Madhya Pradesh. Singh, primarily an organisational man, has a vast experience in managing rallies and party affairs. But, he has never won any direct election. In 2012 UP election, he unsuccessfully contested from Orai seat. When Singh became a minister in Yogi cabinet, he was not a member of either House of UP. It was only last week when he was elected to Vidhan Parishad.
 
 Mahendra Singh, who is also a BJP national secretary, has been allotted six Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. With Singh as party’s Assam incharge, BJP formed its first government in the northeast state in 2016. 
 
 Sources said though Lok Sabha elections are due in 2019, the party leadership wants to get going from now. While Manoj Sinha and Swatantra Deo Singh have already visited the states allotted to them, Mahendra Singh is expected to visit Maharashtra soon, sources added.
