JAMSHEDPUR: The students of Jamshedpur Women's College on Monday had an enriching experience when   visited the institute to speak on the constructive impact of Vedic yoga on human life. 

 The two-and-a-half-hour-long session on the topic, "Spirituality, contemporary science and Vedic maths," turned out to be an insightful journey into the origin, growth and progress of the Vedic yoga. 
 
  explained to the 1,000-odd students who attended the event that the modern science had its origin in the Vedas and added that scientific inventions could be more effective if they were based on the Vedic studies. 
 
 Asserting that computers, binary science and basic maths have their origin in the Vedas, the seer said the use of Vedic science for making a development roadmap would be much more effective and holistic to the entire world. 
 
 He also said that Vedic science could answer many questions which modern-day science failed to address. 
 
 "Regular practice of Vedic yoga helps in sharpening the memory which in turn improves the intuitive ability of a person and helps in increasing the presence of mind," said Swami Nischalananda, while explaining the benefits of practising yoga in day-to-day life.
 
 He said meditation and yoga were important components of human life and it should be practised for the betterment of the mind and soul. 
 
 "Yoga is nature's creation that got its structure and shape in the Vedic ages," said Swami Nischalananda, who is the Peethadheeshwar Jagadguru Shankaracharya of   in Puri, one of the four maths founded by   in the 8th century. 
 
 "It was a fascinating experience to listen to the seer on a topic that looks very easy to talk about but difficult to dwell on," said a group of PG students at the end of the session.
