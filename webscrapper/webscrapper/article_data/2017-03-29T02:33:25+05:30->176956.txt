MUMBAI: A BEST   was badly damaged when the portion of a   fell on it at the maintenance workshop in Dadar on Monday night. Nobody was injured.

 BEST officials blamed the driver of a dumper truck for the mishap. The truck, at a building construction site next to the depot, had crashed into the wall from the other side.
 
 “The wall collapsed due to the impact and fell on the bus, parked on the other side (in the maintenance workshop),” said BEST public relations officer Manoj Varade. He alleged that the driver was negligent. BEST officials lodged a complaint with the Matunga police and demanded action against the site supervisor.
 
 Police said they had booked the driver, Rajesh Kumar Tripathi, for negligent driving and he was later released on bail.
 
 Varade said, “The truck was being used for carrying debris from the construction site. The damage to the bus was extensive. But the actual loss is yet to be ascertained.”
 
 A BEST official said, “We usually send our buses to the workshop in Dadar (E) for repairs and replacement of spare parts, following which these vehicles are introduced on busy routes. With this bus being badly damaged, it could affect some services.”
 
 Sources said the undertaking was already facing a shortage of buses, with the fleet size being depleted recently and a delay in arrival of 300 new buses. “Every single bus counts for BEST, as they run 180-190km daily and cater to thousands of commuters,” an official added.
