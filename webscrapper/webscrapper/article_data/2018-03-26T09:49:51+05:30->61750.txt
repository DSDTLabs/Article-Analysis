MUMBAI: A 16-year-old   died in a fall that the pillion rider said was caused by a policeman swinging a lathi at them near Bandra Reclamation late on Saturday. The   rubbished the allegation. 

 The deceased, Imran Shaikh, was from Dharavi. The pillion rider was his cousin, Sajid Shaikh. The police said they were racing with other bikers.
 
 The police said Imran took the bike of his elder brother, a garment businessman, and with Sajid went to Bandra Reclamation. Sajid said that one of two policemen standing there hit them with a stick. 
 
 Imran, who had no driving licence and was wearing no helmet, suffered serious head injuries from the fall and died on the spot. The injured Sajid was taken to Bhabha Hospital by the public, said a friend.
 
 The police said that Imran was part of a group of three bikers who were racing and doing stunts and there had been a lot of complaints from residents about such activities. 
 
 The police said the CCTV footage of the stretch where Imran fell did not corroborate Sajid’s allegations. “I have conducted the preliminary inquiry, gone through the CCTV footage and nothing of this sort has come to light,” DCP (zone 9) Paramjit Dahiya said.
 
 Sajid’s father, Abdul, said said they met Dahiya and he had promised an inquiry by an ACP.
 
 “Our boy Sajid will not tell lies,” he said. “He has clearly said he can identify the policeman who hit Imran with the lathi.”
