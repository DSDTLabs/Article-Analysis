HYDERABAD: Traffic police have booked 46 cases against men in khaki for violating traffic rules in three months. Incidentally, these cases were booked on complaints received on their social media platforms. However, road safety experts dismiss them as just 10% of the violations.

 
 "We get complaints through social media. We also book cases when we carry out special drives. We received 29 complaints through WhatsApp, 12 complaints on  , 3 on Twitter and two cases on   application," Hyderabad additional commissioner of police (Traffic) Anil Kumar said.
 
 Recently, Hyderabad traffic police posted pending traffic challans against a traffic policeman on their official Facebook page.
 
 They posted the picture of the four pending challans against the policeman with a message: “'We won't wink at the violations of our men. We definitely shoot him with e-Challan. Traffic Law is equal for all and should b followed for our own safety. Please wear a helmet. Happy riding (sic).”
 
 Soon after the post, people started sharing pictures of other cops not wearing a helmet or triple riding and other violations.
 
 "Police personnel are treated no differently. They receive a warning and attend counselling sessions," the additional CP said.
 
 "Through social media alone, the cases are close to 50, which is only 10% of the violations. Almost every now and then I see cops driving without helmet or park their vehicles in the middle of the road. One of the most common violation is putting a 'police' sticker on their personal vehicle's registration number, which is also a violation," Vinod Kumar Kanumala, founder of  , said.
 
 Director-general,  , T   said such behaviour by government officials, especially police, was not acceptable. “We will take up a campaign this month-end and educate all government employees not to violate traffic rules,” he added.
