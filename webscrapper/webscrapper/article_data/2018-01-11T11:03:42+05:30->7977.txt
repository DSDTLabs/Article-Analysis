DIBRUGARH: The first medical institution of the northeast, Dr   White   here - which was lying in a state of disrepair for years - is all set to receive a new lease of life. Oil India Limited (OIL) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to convert the abandoned hospital into a medical museum. 

 "We have set a 15-month target to complete the project. It will be a gift to the people of Assam," Dibrugarh deputy commissioner Laya Madduri said. OIL will invest Rs 2.1 crore for the preservation, restoration and renovation of the school under its corporate social responsibility initiative.
 
 In 1858, a 24-year-old British surgeon, John Berry White, came to Assam to work under the East India Company. He was posted in upper Assam as an assistant surgeon, serving in various capacities for 24 years and finally rising to the position of civil surgeon of what was then Lakhimpur district. 
 
 In 1882, following his retirement, he contributed all of his life savings of Rs 50,000 (around Rs 10 million today) for setting up a medical school. In his will, White wrote that the institution should be set up at Dibrugarh. On November 19, 1896, he passed away in London and four years after his death, the   was set up at Dibrugarh.
