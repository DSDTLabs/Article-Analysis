Bharuch: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Praful Patel has hit out at BJP government in Gujarat saying that it has only resorted to marketing extravaganza that has yielded no tangible benefits to people.  “There is no major improvement in people’s quality of life despite BJP being in power for the last 22 years. They are experts at marketing. The beneficiaries of the so-called development are handful few and most of the people are only suffering,” Patel said, during his recent visit to Bharuch.  Patel said that farmers, labourers and common people were the worst-affected. “Unemployment is a serious problem and a challenge for the state government here. If youth do not get proper job opportunities, they would take to streets someday,” he said, adding that Gujarat needs a strong leadership and a party that cares for the poor.  The NCP leader also said that his party would contest the assembly elections scheduled later this year in the state. TNN
