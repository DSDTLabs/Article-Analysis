Hours after he was crowned winner of Bigg Boss Telugu on Sunday,  , we hear, packed off to Shirdi along with his family for some much-needed fresh air and divine blessings.

 “You’d normally expect the winner to jump with joy and enthusiastically grab the trophy and `50 lakh cheque. But as soon as show host   raised Siva’s arm in the air to signal he’d won, he got emotional and rushed towards his wife and kids seated in the front row for a long-awaited hug. Soon after, he headed to Shirdi with his family. He’s expected to be back in Hyderabad today,” says a source close to the actor.
 
 The show hosted by Jr NTR proved to be a runaway success and majority of people across the two Telugu States were glued to their television sets on Sunday, rooting for their favourite contestants. Adarsh, Siva,  ,   and   were shortlisted for the finals based on public voting and ultimately, the contest boiled down to Siva and Adarsh. Navdeep and Hari Teja, who were considered front runners for the title, were surprisingly eliminated in the finals along with Archana. Siva received 3,34,3,170 votes, winning by a margin of nearly 9000 votes. A total of 11, 95, 36,130 votes had been polled for the finale.
 
 An overwhelmed Siva said he was grateful to the public who voted for him and said he could not find the words to describe his happiness. Talking about his fellow contestants, he said, “They are beautiful people and I could come this far only because of them. They definitely deserve the credit for my win. I personally believe that after the age of 18, one cannot have new friends; people we meet end up as mere acquaintances. But I have found new friends and I’ll carry the memories for a lifetime.”
