KOLKATA: Hours after Syama Prasad Mookerjee’s bust was defaced on Wednesday, KMC authorities promised to restore it though no concrete plan was drawn up. A civic official, however, claimed the statue might not be restored and might have to be replaced.

 Mayor   told reporters he would definitely look into the matter but remained tight-lipped about the plan. “Let me first assess how much damage has been done. Only then will I be able to talk about restoration,”   told TOI.
 
 A team from the civic parks department, which visited the   crematorium for assessment, took pictures of the statue and returned to the KMC headquarters for a discussion with their seniors.
 
 But the officials of the department, which maintains Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Memorial Garden, said they were yet to receive any instruction from the civic top brass on restoration. “I sent a team from the parks department to assess the extent of the vandalisation. Going by their accounts and the photographs, I have come to the conclusion that the bust cannot be restored. It has to be replaced,” a department senior told TOI.
 
 But another KMC official pointed out that replacement might not be easy as the statue was made by sculptor K C Pal in 1983 at his studio in  . “The record shows a Krishnagore-based sculptor created the statue. We need to either contact him or find another sculptor for another bust of Syama Prasad,” said a parks department official. The department is also weighing the option of carrying out a temporary repair till the authorities approved the plan for replacement.
 
 “We have covered the bust and deployed security personnel there to prevent any further untoward incident. In case of minor repairs, we will do so after consulting a sculptor from the city,” said the civic official.
