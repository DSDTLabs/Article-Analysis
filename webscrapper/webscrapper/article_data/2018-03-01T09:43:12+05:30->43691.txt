CHANDIGARH: Chief minister   Singh on Wednesday said he was in favour of naming the   as Shaheed   Airport, in memory of the great hero of India’s freedom struggle. Amarinder was talking to media persons at Punjab Police Academy in Phillaur when he made this statement. 
 
 Punjab’s assertion comes a day after Union civil aviation minister   said in Chandigarh that the war of words over the naming of the Chandigarh international airport was uncalled for. 
  
 There have been reports that Haryana, which is a partner state in the airport, is not happy with Punjab’s demand to name the new airport as Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh International Airport Mohali.   had said that the airport could be named after Bhagat Singh but the Centre must ensure that the airport contains the word ‘Chandigarh’ and nothing else. 
  
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the civil air terminal at Chandigarh airport on September 11 last year. Earlier, in January 2016, Punjab   workers were lathicharged by police while they were marching to the airport to demand change of name.
