BHUBANESWAR: The   (BMC) has decided to rope in a wing of the   to assist them in disposal and processing of   generated in the city. 

 In what is another step in the smart city's efforts to go green and reduce harmful footprints in its environment, the civic body has tied up with the   (IFC) for technical help when it comes to devising the methods of doing so.
 
 A team of the IFC, led by e-waste expert  , visited several spots in the city to gain insight on generation and dumping of e-waste. Together, the teams will come up with a working model for its collection and disposal. The IFC had earlier guided the civic bodies of Hyderabad and Ahmedabad on e-waste disposal.
 
 The BMC's   ( ) cell handles the Transit Transfer Station near Sainik School where municipal solid waste is temporarily dumped before being taken to its designated site at Daruthenga, on the outskirts of the city. The IFC team examined the municipal waste and saw if it contains any e-waste.
 
 The city is home to several offices, both big and small. Large healthcare and financial organisations, in addition to schools, colleges, universities, private business houses and shopping malls which use electronic gadgets on a daily basis pose an enormous challenge in the process of disposal of e-waste. According to a source at the BMC, the disposal of e-waste, currently maintained by the informal sector, ie scrap dealers, helps recover only 30 per cent of metals from the waster. "Recycling in a scientific way can fetch about 90 per cent of the metal which can then be reused for various purposes. If the e-waste is properly recycled, it can reduce the pressure on the environment," said an officer of the BMC.
 
 According the guidelines set by the team of the IFC, the BMC will launch an awareness campaign among consumers and households regarding e-waste so that e-waste is not disposed with municipal waste.
