CUTTACK: Dengue has struck Cuttack again. Despite the tall claims of   (CMC), on Thursday a medical student residing in   was admitted to   and hospital's dengue ward for treatment while a day earlier a 30-year-old youth from Ranihat was admitted there. 

 The third case was detected in Nuabazar. 
 
 With the onset of dengue panic has spread in the city. People are worried since last year more than 900 people were affected by the mosquito menace.
 
 "The CMC knew very well about dengue but it hardly took any measures to check the outbreak of the disease this year. The entire city is in a mess with garbage lying around and puddles of water everywhere, providing a perfect breeding ground for dengue causing mosquitoes," said Lalit Das, a senior citizen residing in Ranihat.
 
 CMC commissioner Bikash Mohapatra visited the house of Kanhu Charan Reddy, the dengue patient admitted to SCB on Wednesday, with a team of health and sanitation officials. The team reviewed the situation in the area. 
 
 "A special team has been deployed in Ranihat to trace the source of dengue. Besides, we have started awareness campaign in the region to educate people about the dos and dont's related to dengue," CMC's chairman of standing committee on health and sanitation, Ranjan Biswal, said.
 
 CMC officials said bushes would be pruned and sanitation drive would be intensified in the affected areas and fogging will also be done to contain dengue. 
 
 However, people blamed the CMC's apathy for the onset of dengue in the city.
 
 "The CMC was busy giving assurances and making false claims about dengue preparedness. Dengue has now become a regular phenomena in Cuttack and ironically authorities are doing nothing to check it," alleged S K Das, a lawyer.
 
 Citizens further alleged that neither the drains were desilted nor the wards cleaned, adding to the problem.
