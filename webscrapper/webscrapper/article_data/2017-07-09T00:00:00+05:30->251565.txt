What brings out the best in you.
 
  
 
 A tough mind with a soft heart. 
 
  
 
 A perfectionist. I am also restless by nature. 
 
  
 
  and elegant. 
 
  
 
 A good mood and a well-fitted, outfit. I feel sexy when I am being myself. 
 
  
 
 A well-fitted pair of jeans, a white shirt/tee, a little black dress, a leather jacket, a pair of linen pants and a beautiful sari. 
 
  
 
  lotion, a pair of shades and a great perfume. 
 
  
 
 My motherâ€™s hand-painted tops.
 
  
 
 No strategy. I should just fall in love with that piece of clothing. 
 
  
 
 Smell great always.
 
  
 
 Keep it simple and be confident in whatever you wear.
  
 
 Piercing odd body parts. 
 
  
 
 Black heels, comfortable walking shoes, tan flats, ballerinas, light-gold strappy heels and nude pumps.
 
  
 
 I once wore a black dress with a skin-coloured inner. It looked fine in the mirror but miserable on the red carpet with all those lights. Next day, it was an internet sensation. I was super embarrassed. Moral of the story: get clicked in flash lights before entering an event.
