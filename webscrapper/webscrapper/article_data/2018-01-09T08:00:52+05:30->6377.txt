CHENNAI: A crack formed on   High Road after a portion of the soil gave way during metro rail work on Monday afternoon, disrupting traffic for more than an hour. Vehicle movement was restored later in the evening. Officials said the incident happened on the stretch between   and Tollgate elevated metro stations where work is on to build the pile foundation. 

 Workers were excavating soil to build the pile cap for the elevated section of the corridor for phase-I extension when soil below the road slipped into a pit dug for the purpose leading to a crack on the road, said   (CMRL) officials. The 7-km elevated section from Tondiarpet to Wimco Nagar is part of the 9-km phase-I extension between   and Wimco Nagar to connect far-flung North Chennai areas with the rest of the city.
 
 An official said they put up structure to temporarily support a pit dug to lay the pile cap a thick concrete layer built just below the road surface to connect both the foundation below and the pillar above. 
 
 CMRL officials rushed to the spot and as a preventive measure, traffic was closed. Vehicles heading to Thiruvottiyur were diverted towards Surya Narayanan Street for an hour, they said. "The pit has been filed with earth brought from outside and traffic has been restored now," officials confirmed in the evening.
 
 Officials had earlier said soil in the area was mostly clay and sand making it easier for them to complete tunnelling well ahead of the deadline.
 
 Work on construction of the elevated section with seven stations began last year even as CMRL completed the underground tunnelling for a 2-km line connecting Washermenpet to   ahead of the deadline.
 
 During tunnelling, there were several cases of cracks on the buildings and foam leakage in houses that officials said was mostly due to shallow house foundations and unclosed borewells.
