While earlier reports suggested that veteran actor   will be celebrating his 71st   at the Kapoors’ Chembur residence, his family eventually threw him a bash at a popular eatery in Khar on Thursday evening.   turned up minus husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, paparazzi’s darling,  , while   was accompanied by kids Samaira and Kiaan. Her alleged beau Sandeep Toshniwal was conspicuous by his absence.

 Also in attendance were Randhir’s brothers, Rajiv and Rishi Kapoor, and sister-in-law Neetu Kapoor. Ranbir Kapoor, who is a regular at most Kapoor dos, was missing from action as he is busy shooting for Brahmastra in Bulgaria. Randhir’s sister, Rima Jain’s sons Aadar and Armaan Jain also made an appearance to wish their mama. The late Shashi Kapoor’s son, Kunal Kapoor, was also spotted at the party.
 
 Sweetly enough, the birthday cake read, ‘Happy Birthday Nana, We Love You — Samaira, Taimur, Kiaan’. Within hours of the party, photos of the Kapoor khandaan celebrating flooded social media platforms. Karisma and Kareena’s mother Babita feeding Randhir Kapoor cake made for a happy family picture.
