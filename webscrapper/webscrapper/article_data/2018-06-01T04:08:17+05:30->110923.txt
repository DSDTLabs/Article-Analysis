NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court granted relief on Thursday to former Union minister P  , protecting him from arrest till July 3 in the INX Media corruption case.

 
 Justice A K Pathak asked Chidambaram to join the probe and cooperate with the   as and when called by the agency, even as he issued notice to the probe agency seeking its stand on Chidambaram’s plea.
 
 The HC listed the matter for further hearing on July 3, directing that the agency will not arrest him till the next date of hearing in court.
 
 Justice Pathak’s order came after advocates Kapil Sibal and  , appearing for the former minister, assured the court that the   leader would cooperate with the CBI and sought protection.
 
 Additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta, for the CBI, opposed the plea and argued that Chidambaram should have first approached the trial court instead of moving the HC. But the bench told Mehta that “either you make a statement that you are not going to arrest him or else I need to protect as he apprehends his arrest”.
