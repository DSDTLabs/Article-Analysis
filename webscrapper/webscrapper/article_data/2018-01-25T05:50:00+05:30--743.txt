 Chennai: Defending the action of its junior seer Vijayendra Saraswathi, in not standing up when the ‘Tamil Thai Vaazhthu’ was played at a book release function in Chennai in which governor Banwarilal Purohit too participated, the Kancheepuram Mutt in a statement said it was a prayer to ‘Tamil mother’ and it was customary for the acharya to meditate when a prayer was recited. 
 
 “At the start of every Mutt function, we used to recite a Sanskrit sloka which will recall the history of the Mutt including Ekambaranathar and Kamakshi Amman temples. Every time the sloka is recited, all devotees and Mutt officials stand up. But, the acharyas will sit in meditation as it is a prayer. Similarly Tamil thai vaazhthu is also a prayer and the acharya was in meditation,” said Mutt manager Sundaresan. 
 
 He said the Mutt had love and respect for Tamil and there was a separate Tamil ‘padasala’ (institute) from which several students graduated every year. “Thevaram and Thiruvasakam are being taught to students. These treatise is not present day Tamil but belonging to Sangam period. Even four days ago we honoured several Tamil scholars for their prowess in the language,” said Sundaresan.
