 Karan Singh (23), a resident of Sector 56, told police he had applied for admission to   in Atlanta for an MS degree in 2017. He received an e-mailed reply in August 2017 from a person who identified himself as the former chancellor of the university.

 Subsequently, Singh claimed to have got an international call from someone who introduced herself as Mendes. She allegedly sent Singh scholarship forms and asked him to pay processing fees of $400 and $1,468, telling him these would be reimbursed by the end of December 2017. Thereafter, Singh claimed he was contacted by someone claiming to be from the US embassy in Delhi, who asked him to transfer Rs 25,900 to a Bank of India account. He also transferred Rs 96,000 to an Axis Bank account in Noida on November 13, 2017. He received another call to pay US$2,500 for a “fee waiver form”.

 Mendes then asked Singh to deposit money for medical forms and on December 8, he deposited Rs 32,250 and Rs 35,460 to a Canara Bank account. When he sent the form, he was told he would be reimbursed. The “embassy contact” then called to borrow $430, saying he has to go to Atlanta from Spain as his brother had passed away. Accordingly, Singh deposited Rs 27,650 into a Canara Bank account.
 
 He was sent receipts of all the money he had deposited on official-looking stationery. Thereafter, he got an email from the university, through an official ID, that his admission was rejected. When he contacted Mendes, she promised to get his admission done, but Singh would have to pay for her flight ticket from Texas to Atlanta. Singh approached police on January 8.
