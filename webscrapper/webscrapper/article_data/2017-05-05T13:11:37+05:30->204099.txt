CANACONA: Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) officials on Thursday raided a sweet mart along NH 17, in the market area in Chaudi-Canacona, and sealed drinking water bottles and sweets. The samples have been sent for tests. 

 Local resident Jisto Gracias, who is a frequent customer of this shop, purchased two 20-litre canisters of packaged water, but noticed some leakage in the canisters. He questioned the owner,  , who washed his hands off the problem, arguing that it was the company that packed it. 
 
 Gracias then visited Vaishnav’s residence, which is just 50 metres away from the shop, and found some women filling tap water in the canisters. He clicked some pictures and forwarded the same to the NGO Aami Goenkar, which filed a complaint with the FDA. 
 
 A huge crowd gathered outside the shop while it was raided by the FDA officials. The agitated locals demanded that the sweet mart be shut until directed by the FDA to operate again. Vaishnav, a native of Rajasthan, refused to speak to reporters. 
 
 Local resident   said, “People don’t drink tap water because it’s dirty, and prefer mineral water. Strict action should be taken against the vendors for playing with our lives”.
