Lucknow:   and development may have failed to make inroads in villages of Banda, Manikpur, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, etc, election campaign material has made its way successfully. Villagers of Bundelkhand are astonished to see efforts of various political parties who have not spared using even primary schools for publicity. 

 Venturing into Tedhua village, TOI team saw a school in which students were wearing badges of a political party. On being asked, a girl of class IV could not tell which party symbol it was. 
 
 In the last assembly polls, seven districts of Bundelkhand saw less than 60% voting percentage. Hariram, a villager of Tikariya village said, “It is the responsibility of school teachers to educate children about election rules, voters’ rights, etc but they are busy helping in party propaganda.”
 
 In Gidruha village, another boy Surendra is seen wearing a political party’s symbol as a badge on his shirt. “I don’t know...some people came to distribute this badge in my school and I wore it on my shirt...It’s a flower and looks good on my shirt,” he said. When asked what he expected from the new government or which party distributed the badge, he replied he didn’t know.
