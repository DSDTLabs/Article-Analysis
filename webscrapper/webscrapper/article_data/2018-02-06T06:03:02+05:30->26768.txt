MUMBAI: Replying to a query by prison authorities on remission for  ,   prosecutor   on Monday submitted before a special court that he has to undergo 60 years in prison to serve his life sentence.

 Salem is serving multiple life sentences concurrently.
 
 The CBI, however, also pointed out that the Indian government while seeking Salem’s extradition from Portugal had given an undertaking that he would not get more than 25 years.
 
 The prosecutor in his reply said that the state has to be apprised of the prison guidelines, the undertaking and SC observations on gravity of the crime when it considers his remission plea. Rules allow a convict sentenced to life to seek remission after 12 years in jail. Taloja prison authorities where Salem is undergoing life terms in two cases—1993 blasts and   murder—had moved the court last December as he completed almost 13 years in prison. The court had asked the CBI to file its reply.
