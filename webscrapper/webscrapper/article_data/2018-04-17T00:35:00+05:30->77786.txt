Kanyakumari: In a big relief for many petitioners, especially the illiterate coming to the Kanyakumari district collectorate, college students from the district are offering their services to write the petitions for free. The students are also helping them by guiding them to various government offices and departments on the premises. The initiative has been jointly undertaken by the district administration and the Indian Red Cross Society. Officials in the district administration said that they receive around 300 petitions during the weekly grievances meeting held on Mondays. “Many illiterate people from rural areas and coastal hamlets and a few educated people too face difficulty writing a petition,” district secretary of Red Cross Society, A Premalalitha said. There are more than a dozen petition writers who render the service for a price at a few places in and around the district collectorate. “But they are in a hurry to write more petitions so that they can make money. So we have introduced the free petition writing service in the May I Help You desk at the entrance of the collectorate,” she said. Every week, around eight to 10 students would be available to help the public. They would take turns so that their education is not affected. They will also be mentored on the format in which they should write the petition so that the crux of the issue is reaching the eye of the collector and other officials. Revenue officials and personnel from the Red Cross Society will also be available to help the students write the petition. They will be offering this service during the weekly grievances meetings and during the monthly and special grievances meeting for farmers, fishermen, pensioners and differently-abled. With a map of the collectorate that will have pictures of various departments on the premises, students will also guide the public to the departments concerned. “This will be an ongoing project,” Premalalitha added.
