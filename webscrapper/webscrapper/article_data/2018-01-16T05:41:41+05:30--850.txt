“ The outcome of the referendum was rooted largely in the feelings of insecurity prevailing in both the communities, Hindus and Christians. Political parties exploited these sentiments,” says retired professor in political science, Maria  , whose doctoral thesis was on ‘Opinion Poll in Goa — An evaluation of the method to settle the controversy’.

 Rodrigues, who is the former head of department, political science,  , told TOI that the overarching pride and sentiment over the   language served as the anchor in the battle.
 
 Her thesis is a telling commentary of the social divide that the political parties tried to perpetuate in furtherance of their objectives. While the MGP portrayed itself as the saviour of the Bahujan Samaj, the UG sought to play the ‘culture’ card.
 
 “People were told that merger would bring the meeting of the Goddesses   and   after 450 years — that the two Goddesses were separated by cruel colonialism. (Dayanand) Bandodkar (then CM) pointed out that selfish interests within Goa were exploiting the religious and linguistic emotions of the innocent people to keep Goa isolated so that they can continue to live luxuriously by exploiting the masses,” Rodrigues wrote in her thesis.
 
 To counter this propaganda, the UG designed its campaign on the theory that merger would destroy Goa’s identity and its unique culture and thereby Goans would become ‘total non-entities’.
 
 Rodrigues also debunks the theory of the ‘Father of Opinion Poll’. “If it were not for Nehru, we would not have got the Opinion Poll. I wouldn’t say anybody in particular should be termed as the Father of the Opinion Poll. There are heroes and there are unsung heroes. And I would say the unsung heroes were the people of Goa,” she says.
