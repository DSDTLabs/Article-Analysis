GURUGRAM: Health services in government hospitals and health centres across the district may take a hit due to BJP president Amit Shah’s rally on Thursday. Around a dozen doctors and five ambulances from Gurugram have been sent to Jind for three days for   duty, following the orders of the state director of health services on Monday. 

 Shah’s ‘1-lakh bike rally’ is expected to have a participation of 1,111 motorcycles from each assembly constituency in the state. Two physicians, two surgeons, two anesthetists and six general doctors from each of the 22 districts in the state have been deployed to Jind for duty from Tuesday till Thursday night. Five ambulances have also been sent to the rally from each district. 
 
 Patient footfall at Gurugram government hospitals and health centres was relatively low on Tuesday due to Shivratri festivities. However, it is expected to rise after hospitals open on Thursday after a gazetted holiday on Wednesday. 
 
 Around 2,000 to 2,500 people visit   in Civil Lines alone daily, which is expected to increase on Thursday after patients from health centres are diverted there. 
 
 Moreover, Gurugram has only 16 ambulances, and these are often insufficient to cater to the high number of patients. With five being sent to Jind, the district is left with only 11 ambulances. “We do have a shortage of resources due to outstation duties, but it is only for one day. Doctors will have to overwork on Thursday and patients might have to wait a little longer. But we are fully equipped to deal with any crisis,” said an official from the health department.
