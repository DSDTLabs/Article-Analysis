GAYA: At least six passengers of 12313 Seladah-New Delhi   were injured and four coaches of the train were damaged after irate passengers of Gaya-Howrah Express resorted to stone pelting around 10.30pm on Monday.

 
 Sources said the Gaya-Howrah Express started late by nearly five hours from Gaya railway station and was stopped only after covering a distance of 5 km at Manpur station for another five hours. The route of the train was also changed mid-way instead of its regular route via Kiul. It was announced to be diverted to Dhanbad- route. 
 
 The sudden announcement for route- change enraged the passengers of the intermediary stations and they quickly indulged in heavy stone pelting at Rajdhani Express as it approached Manpur. At least six passengers of coach numbers B-2, B-3, B-8 and B-11 of the train were injured in the incident.
 
 Eye witnesses claimed that police had a tough time controlling the passengers.
 
 Station director Pavinesh Patel said, “The Gaya-Howrah Express got inordinately delayed as the track developed snag and it was being repaired. The repair work took a long time resulting in the inordinate delay and subsequent diversion. 
 
 After the violence, route change order was cancelled and the train proceeded on its onward journey. All but two passengers were allowed to proceed after first aid.” Gaya railway hospital chief medical officer Dr DK Sahay said none of the passengers received serious injuries and nobody was hospitalised. 
 
 Movement of train on the Gaya-Dhanbad section remained paralysed for more than three hours and the affected trains included Bhuwaneshawar-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, which remained stranded at the crime-prone Bandhua station.
 
 DK Jain, president of the Grand Chord Passengers Association said, “Route change and subsequent route restoration reflected gross managerial deficit.”
