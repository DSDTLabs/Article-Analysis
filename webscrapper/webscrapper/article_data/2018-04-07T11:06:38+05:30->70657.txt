PANAJI: In order to assist the government in curbing the sale of   to children, the   (NOTE), together with  , a consumer organisation based in Delhi, is beginning a survey of vendors selling tobacco and its products in the state.

 A team will travel across the state and will use an app to map each place where cigarettes and tobacco products are sold. Special attention will be paid to vendors found selling them in the vicinity of educational institutions. 
 
 “Once the data is collated, we will write to the state government to enforce vendor licensing. Only through vendor licensing can the government control sale. It will also help keep a check on vendors selling tobacco within 100 yards of educational institutions and illegally to children,” chief operating officer of Consumer Voice, Ashim Sanyal, said
 
 Presently, shops selling tobacco are registered under the Shops and Establishments Act. NOTE and Consumer Voice will push the government to ensure that tobacco vendors obtain a distinct licence to sell tobacco products. 
 
 NOTE president Dr   said smoking in the state has come down from around 50% of the population in 1984 to around 10% today. “Cigarette-smoking has reduced, but beedi and gutka consumption has not decreased as per our expectations,” he said, adding that research has now proved that supari is considered precancerous, while paan with tobacco, supari and chuno are perceived to be a dangerous combination. Tobacco usage doesn’t just cause oral cavity cancer but could also result in other types of cancer, including that of the breast, Salkar said.
 
 Sanyal said the new generation was moving away from the traditional fire-smoking to a new category called heat-smoking. No fumes are emitted but nicotine consumption is as harmful, he said. 
 
 An estimated eight lakh individuals die of cancer in India each year, 35-40% cases of which could be attributed to the usage of tobacco, Salkar said.
