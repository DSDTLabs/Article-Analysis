Coimbatore: As many as 1,500 pumpsets arranged to spell out ‘Coimbatore Pump City’ on the VOC Park Ground on Thursday gave ample testimony to the vibrant industrial atmosphere in the region that produces nearly 40% of the motors and pumps in the country. 

 Twenty-five major pump manufacturers from the city came together to create the display as part of Coimbatore Vizha. “We wanted to celebrate the spirit of enterprise, which is ingrained in Coimbatore and roped in major pump manufacturers here to do the display,” said  , chair, Young Indians, Coimbatore chapter, who organised the event. 
 
 “The manufacturers usually don’t store their products. Some of the pumps were so heavy that we needed three people to carry them. Most of the pumps came packed. The manufacturers took the trouble to bring them all the way, unpack them and arrange them,”   told TOI.
 
 Kanishka Arumugam, director of  , said, “Coimbatore has been making pumps for more than 50 years. Today, it has been dubbed the ‘Pump City of Asia’. Even European and American pump manufacturers have set up shops here.”
 
 The next 10 years are going to be very competitive for the Indian pump manufacturers, Kanishka said. “Pump manufacturers in Coimbatore should look beyond agricultural and residential pumps and diversify. They should start making industrial pumps if they want to stay in the business,” he added.
