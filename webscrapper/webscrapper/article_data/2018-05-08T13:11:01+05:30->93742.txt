Director Santhosh P Jayakumar’s latest adult horror comedy ‘Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kuththu, which released last week, has created enough controversies in Tamil Nadu. Though the film has been getting a good response from youngsters, many found it offensive and vulgar.

 Veteran filmmaker   has now issued a statement slamming the CBFC board for allowing such films to release in a state like Tamil Nadu. Without mentioning the name of the film, Bharathiraja asked Tamilians to boycott such films, as it’s vulgar and crass. Furthermore, Bharathiraja questioned the responsibility of censor board when it comes to certifying adult films.
 
 Concluding his note, Bharathiraja also criticised the director of ‘Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kuththu’, stating that there are other ways to earn money. On the other hand, producer J Satish Kumar also posted a sarcastic tweet against CBFC, which had problems certifying the Bollywood film ‘Padmaavat’.
 
 Satish wrote, "Wish #cbfc for great gesture censoring with so much social responsibility#IruttuArayilMurattuKuthu fabulous work by #censor board members wish entire #cbfc to continue encouraging this kind of films that society needs so good messages for our youngsters.”
 
 “When #padmavati had #censor issues I was wondering but now only I came to know #Padmavati is not as good as #IruttuArayilMurattuKuthu so now #cbfc as clearly guided us norms how to film and what to film thanks for guidelines," he added.
 
 roduced by Studio Green, ‘Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kuththu’ stars   in the lead, while actors Vaibhavi Shandilya, Karunakaran, Bala Saravanan and Rajendran play important roles. The film is Gautham Karthik’s second association with director   after their ‘Hara Hara Mahadevaki’ that released last year.
