VADODARA: In a major embarrassment to the city police, burglars broke into six shops in a commercial complex within a matter of few hours. The burglars entered Chanakya Complex located on the main road late on Tuesday night and broke open locks of the shops. The   police, however, didn’t file any FIR in the case.

 According to shopkeepers, the burglars targeted the shops one after other but couldn’t find much to steal. They stole some cash from one of the shops. The police have got images of the burglars from the CCTV footage of the shops. The six properties that the burglars targeted include a tuition class, Om Electricals, Excel Entertainment Dance Class, Siddhi Vinayanak Marketing and a sealed shop.
 
 Police said that since nothing much was stolen from these shops, they just took an application. Locals said that the same complex had witnessed burglary about eight months ago when goods were stolen from two shops. 
 
 On Monday night, burglars had targeted a bungalow in the Kunj Society, Alkapuri and fled with diamond jewellery worth Rs 23.5 lakh. Owner of the bungalow Mukesh Daliya told the police that the burglars locked them inside their rooms before committing the crime.
 
 The city police have stepped up their night patrolling over last few months. Special squads have also been formed to patrol majority of the areas throughout the night. And, to ensure that the patrolling parties conduct their duty properly, the police have installed QR code plates for scanning the attendance. But such burglaries have raised questions over the effectiveness of the patrolling squads.
