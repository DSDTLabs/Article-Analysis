 is looking forward to taking a break from action and dabble with some romance. His preparation for the lead role in Karan Johar’s 'Student Of The Year 2' ('SOTY2') is on in full swing. “The film gives me a chance to prove my mettle in areas other than heavy-duty action and dance. It’s a complete contrast to what I have done in '  2'. A chocolate boy role, it’s a young space to be in, the kind you saw in 'Grease', 'Step Up' or 'High School Musical'. It’s a young, chilled-out film and such a relief to not be uptight while doing a scene. I can be casual, which automatically makes a scene look easy on the eyes. Basically, with this film I get to play my age — a usual, regular youngster.”

 He will feature with two new leading ladies,   and   (there hasn’t been an official word yet) in 'SOTY2'. He says, “I just think this will be a lot of fun. I will be able to relate to my co-stars because I was in their shoes once upon a time. I will make them feel at ease for sure.” The cast is going through rehearsals and readings right now. Tiger adds, “They’re doing look-tests, too. People will appreciate their looks for sure. I am trying to lose weight as I need to have a younger and casual-looking body. I have to think I am cooler than I actually am. I need to get more swag, which I don’t think I have right now.”
