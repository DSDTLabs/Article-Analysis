PATNA: Education minister   on Wednesday told the state assembly that the state government would soon introduce “virtual classrooms” in 1,000 schools of the state so that “outstanding teachers” can provide guidance and educational inputs to the students.

 Choudhary said the facility would be extended to remaining schools in phases. “The students would be able to listen to lectures of outstanding teachers to enhance and improve their knowledge,” the minister added.
 
 Choudhary was giving the government’s reply to the House debate on education department’s Rs 25,251.38 crore budgetary demand for 2017-18. The cut motion in the debate was moved by BJP member Sanjay Sarawagi. However, the NDA members led by leader of opposition Prem Kumar walked out of the House during the minister’s reply.
 
 The budgetary demand includes Rs 11,033.50 crore to be spent on development activities. The education department’s budget for 2017-18 is the highest among all the other departments.
 
 Choudhary said the BJP members of the House were highly critical of the performance of the education department, but the high point of the state education department was that the Centre has decided to replicate the internal evaluation mechanism that the department has introduced to assess and improve the performance of the students and teachers.
