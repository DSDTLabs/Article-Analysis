NASHIK: The preparations for monsoon will cost citizens their summer as the Maharashtra State   Distribution Company Limited ( ) will shut down the supply to trim down trees that cause a hindrance to the  .

 Starting April 9, there will be no power supply on Saturdays in areas where trees are being trimmed so that they do not affect the power lines. The work will start at 9am and will finish once the work is done.
 
 The power supply company has already drawn up a plan to start implementing the annual exercise of trimming trees.
 
 “Nashik has overhead electricity supply lines which get affected every monsoon as the tree branches fall on the live wires due to heavy rains. This leads to the power supply snapping. In order to tackle this problem, the MSEDCL is taking scheduled power cuts to trim the branches of trees so that the power supply remains intact,” a senior officer said.
 
 The move will be carried out across the city where there are trees under the power supply lines and are expected to grow rapidly during the monsoon.
 
 “The exercise will be taken up in April and will finished by early May before the bout of pre-monsoon showers begin. This month, the MSEDCL officials were busy in revenue recovery due to which the only time the exercise can be carried out in April, which will stretch till the end of May,” said the officer.
 
 However, officials from the power supply company said that despite the tree trimming exercise, there could be snapping of power during the rains due to technical faults.
 
 “There is no solution to this problem except if the power lines are made underground, which again is a costly affair and the MSEDCL cannot afford it now,” the officer added.
