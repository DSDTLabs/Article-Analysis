 "The Pakistan PM wasn't allowed to speak at the event, even as leaders of some small countries put forward their views on terrorism," a report published in another Pakistan daily 'The Nation' said.
 
 "The popular sentiment among the majority of Pakistani media delegation was that of a total humiliation of the sole Muslim nuclear power because not only there was no mention of Islamabad's role against global terrorism but also the prime minister of the 'frontline state' was denied the opportunity to put forth its point of view." the report said.
 
 Daily Pakistan, another newspaper, also bemoaned how the country was neglected at the summit where 55 Muslim-majority nations also participated. 
 
 "Leaders, who are not even facing the menace of terrorism, were given chances to present their views, but Pakistan was neglected," the daily reported.

 "With a financial cost of around $120 billion and (loss of) thousands of precious human lives, Pakistan has suffered a lot due to this scourge," Sharif told reporters in Saudi Arabia
 
 "The western world was uniting against terrorism, the Muslim world should also be on the same page to tackle the threat," he said.
