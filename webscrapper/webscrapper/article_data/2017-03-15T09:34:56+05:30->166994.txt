LUCKNOW: The six   arrested from Kanpur who allegedly tried to orchestrate acts of terror in UP and MP were desperate to trigger bombings, ATS officials said. 

 “Thankfully, the group did not find dangerous explosive material and tried to make bombs only with gunpowder,” said IG ATS Asim Arun. The group bought firecrackers in bulk from Meston Road and tried to extract gunpowder from them, he added.
 
 Police said the group confessed to have attempted multiple bombings at Ganga Ghat in Kanpur apart from trying to trigger a pipe bomb in Ghatampur locality within the past four months. However, their first success came in the form of a low-intensity train blast which left 10 people injured near Jabdi railway station in Madhya Pradesh on March 7.
 
 A map of the railway network was found at the group’s hideout.   has asked NIA to investigate the group’s role in rail sabotage incidents which have occurred between Kanpur, Unnao and Lucknow rail sections.
 
 Multiple cases of sabotage were detected on the outskirts of Kanpur and Lucknow including one unearthed on January 1 in which three fishplates, 50 clips and cuts on tracks made by hacksaw were found.
 
 “We are checking if the group was present at places where rail sabotage incidents have been attempted in UP and would ask NIA to pursue the leads,” added Arun.
