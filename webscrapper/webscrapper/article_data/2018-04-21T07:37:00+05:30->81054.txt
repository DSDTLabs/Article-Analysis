Dharamshala: The tourists of this hill destination got a flavor of Tibetan culture courtesy Shoton (Yogurt) festival that started on Friday. The festivities include traditional Tibetan dance and song performances and chants as part of Ache Lhamo (Tibetan opera) drawn from Buddhist stories and Tibetan history.

 According to information, the festival was earlier scheduled to begin on April 18 but was deferred as mark of respect for the victims of Nurpur bus accident wherein 27 people, including 23 children were killed.
 
 Started by the Tibetan institute of performing arts (TIPA) near Mcleodganj, the festival is in its 23rd year. The festival was revived in 1995 by the Tibetan artistes living in exile and is known to be associated with the end of retreat of monks.
 
 “In Tibet, the monks of Drepung monastery end their annual summer meditation by eating yogurt. The people from nearby towns come to the monastery at this time to offer yogurt and seek blessings of the monks. Opera troupes also come to perform at the festival and that’s how it became Shoton – the yogurt festival,” said Dr Lobsang Sangay, president of Central Tibetan Administration.
 
 Eleven troupes from different parts of India and one from Nepal are participating in this year’s festival, said the organizers and each troupe would present an excerpt from their performances on the opening day.
 
 Sangay said China was employing a concerted strategy to annihilate Tibetan culture in their attempt to transform Tibetans into Chinese and Tibet into China.
 
 “In exile under the guidance of Dalai Lama, the Tibetan culture is flourishing,” he added.
 
 Performances will be staged at TIPA from 21 to 25 April, and concurrent performances will take place at Norbulingka Institute and TCV School Chauntra from April 21 to 23.
