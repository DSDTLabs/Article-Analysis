ALWAR: A 35-year-old constable in   was injured after   mafia attacked him and attempted to run over him with a tractor near housing board area of the city on Friday night. This is second such attack on cops in four days.

 The incident occurred when constable Narendra Singh was returning after having dinner. Little ahead on the road, he spotted some tractors carrying sand (bajri) and tried to stop the vehicles.
 
 However, when the vehicles did not stop, Singh followed them on his bike. “One of the tractors hit his bike from behind. He was thrown away and injured his back. He informed the control room about the incident. Meanwhile, another vehicle tried to run him over but he escaped,” an official told TOI.
 
 The control room sent reinforcement to the spot which rushed the cop to the hospital. The incident comes close on the heels of attack on deputy SP (DySP) Satish Yadav on Wednesday. Yadav was patrolling on a stretch of the state highway in Dholpur when he received an intelligence input about mining mafia operating in the locality.
 
 Yadav and other cops accompanying him had intercepted a few tractors transporting sand (bajri). The police teams asked drivers to stop their vehicles, instead the mining mafia fired at them and began pelting stones.
 
 “We have filed a case under relevant sections of the IPC. Singh’s condition is stable and he is out of danger,” an official said.
 
 The back-to-back attack on the police and the mining officials has raised fears in the district which is reeling under the effect of illegal sand mining.
 
 The sources said that mining mafia is operating in the region without impunity and is willing to fire at cops who stop them at check points. “We are making efforts to identify the culprits and check if this was the same gang behind the attack on DySp and Singh,” the official told TOI.
