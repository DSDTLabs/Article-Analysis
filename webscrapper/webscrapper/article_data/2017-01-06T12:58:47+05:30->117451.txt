HYDERABAD: Biryani restaurants appear to be in no mood or hurry to switch over to  , an example being the decades-old Alpha hotel at Secunderabad which insists only on cash payments. “At the moment we are accepting only cash,“ an employee of the hotel said.

 Located just across the Secunderabad railway station, the hotel literally buzzes with activity throughout the day and late into the night. Another case in point is Bawarchi ­ at RTC cross roads, which is also insisting on cash payment.Outlets are putting up notices that only cash will be accepted.
 
 Costing between `160 and `220, mutton and chicken biryani are fa Hyderabadis' favourites.Of late, small outlets have also sprung up in the city offering a `takehome' biryani packet for `80 to `110. Hotel Shahdab, another favourite biryani destination at Charminar, is also accepting only cash. Ditto with Shah Ghouse at Shalibanda. A worker of the hotel, however, was quick to add that the res taurant branches at Gachibowli and Toli Chowki were accepting card payments. “We will soon have a meeting to advise hoteliers on the advantage of shifting to cashless transactions. Quite a few have already have done it,“ said  , secretary of  . However those `quite a few' are the three-star hotels and the ones which most people frequent are yet to warm up to cashless payment.“It could be that they have apprehensions about using cards,“ he said.
 
 Surprisingly, outlets which are reluctant to go cashless do not appear to be too worried about losing business.
