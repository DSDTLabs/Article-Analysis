 might be an anchor and voice-over artiste, but he prefers calling himself a ‘disaster manager’. He shares, “Creative agencies put in a lot of time and effort for each show, but on the D-day, it’s an anchor’s job to ensure that the event sails through smoothly. A   needs to be alert and prompt all the time. He should wear his confidence on his sleeve and connect with the audience. Also, during live events, there’s no scope of retakes. So, no matter what the situation is backstage, the show must go on flawlessly. Hosting is not just about talking.” 

  has hosted several high-profile shows and events, including beauty pageants like   and the popular sporting competition, Pro Kabbadi. Recently, he also hosted the Oppo Times Fresh Face finale at Bandra Fort.
