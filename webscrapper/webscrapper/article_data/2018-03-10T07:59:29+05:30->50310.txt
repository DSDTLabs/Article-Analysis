MANALI: Forced to spend harsh winters in temporary sheds for the past five months, five families at Devdhar village near   are fighting for compensation so that they can once again build their houses, which were completely damaged in landslides triggered by unscientific excavation of mountain face by contractors of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

 The survey conducted by Kullu administration has also revealed that the entire area had witnessed no landslide before the NHAI started the digging work. While three houses of the village were destroyed completely, the area developed huge cracks and more houses are under collapsing.
 
 As many 16 members of these five families had to vacate their houses on October 25, 2017, after the land started to sink.
 
 Families of  , Omkar Sharma, Kamlesh Sharma, Suneel Sharma and   built temporary sheds in the village.
 
 Importantly, the district administration has written to NHAI to pay compensation to the affected families.
 
 Jai Narayan Sharma said, “Four-laning work on the highway has ruined our lives. NHAI’s work damaged our land and houses. Where shall we go now? It’s been nearly five months that we are residing in sheds. We have got no relief so far. We are now planning to move the court.”
 
 Kullu SDM Dr   said the houses of the victims didn’t fall in the area acquired by NHAI. “We have been corresponding with NHAI for a long time, but victims have not paid any compensation so far. They also have not assessed the damages. The land sunk and houses damaged only after the excavation work for four-laning of the highway started,” he said.
 
 NHAI project director Lt Col Yogesh Chandra said he is aware of the damages and is in correspondence with the district administration. “I received a letter from the administration just two days back. I am discussing the issue with DC.”
