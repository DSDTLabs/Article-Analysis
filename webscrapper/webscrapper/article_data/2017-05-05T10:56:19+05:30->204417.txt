KOCHI: Celebrated cartoonist and founding chairman of Kerala Cartoon Academy   on Thursday said that cartoonists should be more careful in caricaturing public figures while inaugurating the   organized as part of CariToon Festival 2017.

 “Political figures featured in cartoons that are published in newspapers and journals have become unidentifiable. Even famous politicians could be confusing for the public by the way they are drawn,“ Yesudasan said. As a curtain raiser to the five-day festival, a live cartoon drawing event was held at   during which 60 cartoonists drew simultaneously signifying the 60 years of founding Kerala.
 
 Cartoonists from across the state including Orissa native   who works for Khaleej Times, an international newspaper, participated in the event. “Kerala could be said as the capital of cartoons in India because the scene is quite vibrant here. Cartoonists who are normally bound to their offices or workstations at homes get to meet their counterparts in a lively atmosphere,“ said  , a Mumbaibased cartoonist.
 
 The cartoons that were drawn as a part of the live show featured multiplicities of political and contemporary issues dogging the state, ranging from land mafia to liquor policy.
 
 “It was quite amusing to see a large number of cartoons ba sed on the liquor policy of the state, one of which showed the map of Kerala immersed in an alcohol bottle,“ said Yesudasan. However, some of the audience voiced their concern of cartoons being too political, with the social part being overlooked more or less.
 
 “Cartoons focus majorly on political spats. Social and civic issues are being disregarded, which is quite disheartening,“ said Vijin Paul, a visitor.
