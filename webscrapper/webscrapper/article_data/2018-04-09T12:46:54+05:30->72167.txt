NEW DELHI: Cult motorcycle maker   (HD) has overlooked metros and chosen the North East to open its brand stores in India for the first time. While most upscale retail brands gun for high streets in big cities, HD picked the small cities of Imphal and Siliguri to launch two stores to sell premium apparel and merchandise. HD doesn’t sell motorcycles in brand stores.

  
  
 The company, which sells motorcycles priced upwards of around Rs 6 lakh, will open its third outlet in Kolkata. HD currently does not operate motorcycle stores in Imphal and Siliguri but industry experts said the upcoming highway, connecting India to Thailand through Imphal, is one of the major reasons for the brand to set up shop in the North East.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 “The North East is not only a hub for trendy fashion but also has the maximum number of motorcycle chapters in the country,” said Jean-Pascal Salvaj, VP (wholesale - Asia) for GIII, a company that has a comprehensive portfolio of over 30 licensed and proprietary brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld and Levi’s. “Northeastern men and women have music and fashion in their blood stream. We feel this market has huge potential for a brand like Harley-Davidson and its new fashion line and concept store licensed out to GIII.”
 
  
  
 
 When asked about its plans for India, Salvaj said, “Harley-Davidson apparel is a bridge to luxury brand. So, expansion would be selective and cautious. We chose to start the journey from North East as it is the most fashionable part of India. We are focused on opening 13 exclusive Harley-Davidson apparel stores this year across India.” HD, which started operations in India in 2009, currently operates around 30 bike-selling outlets across the country.
