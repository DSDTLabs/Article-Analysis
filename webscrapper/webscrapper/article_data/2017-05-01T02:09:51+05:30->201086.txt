They had recently shifted to Delhi from Katihar in Bihar, promising their family members to soon buy a house in the capital, so that all of them can live here together. 
 
 A family member told police that that they last spoken to the two at 7pm. “My husband told me that he had a very long day, but had planned to cook a special meal with Arjun. He said he had spent all their money buying things their son had been longing to eat since a long time,” cops quoted Vasudev’s wife. 
 
 Fire officials said that they received a call about the incident at 8.30pm, soon after which seven fire tenders were pushed into action.

The fire was doused within half an hour and the victims were pulled out. “They had sustained 90% burn injuries by the time they were rescued by the fire fighters,” neighbours said. 
 
 The two men were rushed to the hospital. “Family members were immediately informed. By the time they reached the city, both the victims succumbed to their injuries,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 Police said the fire was a result of cylinder leakage in the first floor of the hut. Vinod Mandal, owner of the house said that he heard a loud bang and saw the room above was up in flames.
