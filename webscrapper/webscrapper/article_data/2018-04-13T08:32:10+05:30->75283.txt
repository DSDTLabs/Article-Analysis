HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad district administration and health authorities are sitting on at least 40 applications for issue or renewal of licences to hospitals and nursing homes to use ultrasound machines.

 As per the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, no hospital or nursing home can carry out sex determination test. The Parliament had in 1994 passed the law, which banned female foeticide.
 
 According to sources, the 40 applications have not been processed as appropriate authority was yet to give clearances.
 
 Some hospitals and nursing homes, which applied in 2017, were still awaiting permission and sending patients to scanning centres outside, causing inconvenience. The problem is persisting only in Hyderabad district.
 
 A source told TOI, “Patients are being sent out for ultrasound scans. In cases of emergency and patients in ICU, they are sent to diagnostic centres, which could be dangerous and lead to complications.”
 
  president   told TOI: “Earlier, hospitals could directly purchase ultrasound machines, but now, they have to be purchased either by a radiologist or a gynaecologist. Companies won’t deliver it unless we produce a licence.”
 
 When contacted, Hyderabad district medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr   said: “As per recent information, 40 applications are pending. The multi-member appropriate authority’s meeting is not happening due to various reasons. Earlier, an advisory committee used to grant licences. Now, after the revised guidelines, an inspection has to be carried out by the officials after which the advisory committee has to scrutinize it. Later, the application will be taken up by the multi-member appropriate authority.” The district collector heads the multi-member appropriate authority, while a judge and DMHO are members. Hyderabad district collector Yogita Rana and in-charge DMHO Dr I A Sarala were not available for comment.
