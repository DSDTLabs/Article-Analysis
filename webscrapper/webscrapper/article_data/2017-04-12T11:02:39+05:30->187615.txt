CHANDIGARH:  , who has allegedly been removed from the post of president of Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC), has accused Didar Singh Nalvi and   of joining hands with SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal. Jhinda spoke to TOI on Tuesday, a day after completing `tankhah' (religious punish ment) before the Akal Takht.

 
 
 I just want to make it clear that I have not been removed from the post of president of HSGMC, which is a con stitutional body formed by the assembly. My removal by just 12 members of the 41-member body is unconsti tutional.
 
 
 
 Didar Singh Nalvi, senior vice-president of HSGMC, and Baljit Singh Daduwal, member of the ad hoc com mittee, have joined hands with Parkash Singh Badal for vested interests. They want to spoil a strong case of a separate HSGMC for Haryana before the apex court. Nalvi does not own even a house in Haryana, as his entire family is settled in Punjab, and has nothing to do with the interest of Sikhs of Haryana. He al ways wanted to be come president of the body and has now connived with SGPC to throw out Sikhs from Hary ana who fought for HSGMC.
 
 
 
 The hearing of the case challenging the constitutional validity of HSGMC was at final stage and we were expecting a favourable decision. At this juncture, the petitioner who had challenged the separate body , has changed his counsel and new counsel sought two more months to argue. These two months were sought to ensure that the SGPC can reap the 1500 bumper crop of wheat sanding in the land of Haryana gurdwaras. I would have opposed such move, but to please SGPC and Badal, Nalvi had taken this step to remove me.
 
 
 
 No, there is no question of the weakening of the movement. A majority of   are still with me.
 
 
 
 I was asked to ap pear before the Akal Takth in 2014, but the situation in Punjab was not conducive then. I realized that now the en vironment has changed and it would be bet ter to explain the reasons.
