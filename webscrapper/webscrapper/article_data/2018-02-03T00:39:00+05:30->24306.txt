Trichy: Apart from encroachments, the most common sight across all city roads are haphazardly parked vehicles — even trucks and city buses halt their fleets at a distance from bus stops on the motorable space. Both these issues which affect smooth flow of traffic could be addressed if centre medians are established at probable places, feel road safety experts and the public at large.

 City buses, mostly private fleets, often halt their vehicles away from the bus stop towards the middle of the main road, forcing the trailing vehicles to wait for several minutes. Unmindful of the continuous honking by vehicles queuing behind, the buses hardly move an inch and wait for all passengers to board them. This has been a regular occurrence on Thillai Nagar main road and on roads where city buses ply. “If a centre median dividing the bi-directional traffic is laid on city roads, the mechanism will make people more disciplined on the available motorable space. Instances such as parking the vehicles on the road will come down,” M S Gowtham Shana, an independent road safety analyst, said. Karur bypass road in the city is yet another stretch where a centre median is missing despite the vast space available to extend the roads. Corporation sources said that the Karur bypass road had been a frontrunner in smart road project and the stretch would be given a makeover in the next few months. 
 
 If new centre medians are the need of the hour on wide roads to prevent rash driving and traffic congestion, existing centre medians on West Boulevard and East Boulevard roads are in a pathetic state rendering them useless.
