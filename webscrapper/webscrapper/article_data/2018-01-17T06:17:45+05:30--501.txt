MUMBAI: Opposition leader   and city Congress chief Sanjay   on Tuesday called on governor   to demand the removal of municipal commissioner   and the institution of a CBI probe into the  .

 
 “Owing to dereliction of duty at all levels, the Kamala Mills fire was caused, claiming 14 lives. Last year, 76 people died in Mumbai owing to the BMC’s negligence. As BMC chief, Mehta has failed in supervision,” Vikhe Patil and Nirupam said. Vikhe Patil demanded that the blaze matter be given to the CBI for an independent probe. “Since charges of negligence and dereliction of duty have been levelled against Mehta, it is wrong for him to conduct an inquiry. We are in the process of filing a PIL,” he said.
 
 Vikhe Patil said that at a time illegal constructions were the norm in hotels and restaurants, particularly those at former textile mills, the BMC has failed to initiate stringent action against erring establishments. “Civic officials are in connivance with hotel and restaurant owners. All along the BMC has neglected such illegal activities. Under such circumstances, we demand that the CM immediately suspend Mehta to restore the confidence of people,” he said.
