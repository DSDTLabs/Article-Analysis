LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench   on Thursday asked the state government about the deliberations of the high power committee in connection with the issuing of licence and renewal of slaughter houses and   shops. The court had earlier stressed that choice of food was a fundamental right and there cannot be direct or indirect prohibition on it.

 A bench of justice A P Sahi and justice Sanjai Harkauli passed the order on the writ petition moved by   and others individually. The petitions highlighted the plight of licence holders and those involved in the meat business for generations. “The licences have expired but state authorities are not renewing them,” pleaded the petitions.
 
 Hearing the matter on the last date, the bench had directed the high power committee to deliberate on the issue and apprise it of the outcome. As the matter came up for hearing on Thursday, state government’s special counsel Dr L P Mishra appeared before the bench and said the high power committee had undertaken the exercise on April 10 to delve into the issues. He sought time to file an affidavit about the exercise undertaken or proposed, and the bench put the matter for hearing on April 19.
