Editor-turned-filmmaker Mahesh Narayanan's directorial debut 'Take Off' has arguably been one of the most anticipated movies this year. It's Fahadh Faasil's first film in over a year, it's got   playing the central character, it's got   acting with the duo for the first time and most importantly it's based on the real-life rescue of 46 Indian nurses who were stranded in Iraq during the country's civil war in 2014.

 While most of base story is already known to Malayalis, the challenge for the filmmaker and his team was to make the movie engaging and he takes enough cinematic liberties to accomplish that task with aplomb. 
 
 The first half introduces us to nurse Sameera (Parvathy), 31-year-old divorcee, who is putting a brave front trying to balance her work and family life. In between the adversities, she lets Shaheed (Kunchacko Boban) in to her life and he becomes a ray of hope. 
 
 The first half develops Sameera's character while paying careful attention to the travails of nurses. It also shuttles between Sameera's past and present, till she and Shaheed go to Iraq for work.
 
 Mahesh ensures that he develops his characters so well and in thoroughly engaging manner. So much that the movie in its first half is more of drama yet engrossing.
 
 The interval of the 2 hours 20 min movie is at a point where the civil war in Iraq breaks out, while also serving as a turning point in the characters' lives.
 
 Parvathy is exceptional at her role while Kunchacko packs a restrained yet powerful performance.  , who plays Parvathy's ex-husband, comes up with a matured performance as well.
