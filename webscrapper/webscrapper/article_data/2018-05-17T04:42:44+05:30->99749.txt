NEW DELHI: Seven months after he was  , Kedar Kumar Mandal, accused of allegedly posting an objectionable post on his Facebook page, rejoined work at Dyal Singh College after getting   from the Delhi high  .

 
 The teacher had posted “derogatory and objectionable” remarks against goddess Durga in a Facebook post on September 22, 2017 following which the governing body (GB) chairman, Amitabh Sinha, suspended him and barred his entry to the college premises.
 
 Mandal’s post attracted several complaints, including a police complaint by National Democratic Teachers’ Front (NDTF) and a memorandum submitted to the college principal by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) demanding action against him.
 
 The suspension of Mandal was, however, termed “illegal” by members of the Dyal Singh College Teachers’ Association (DSCTA). The teacher approached HC claiming that he was suspended illegally by the GB chairman and demanded his reinstatement.
 
 In its statement, DSCTA said, “The only authority to suspend a Delhi University teacher is the vice-chancellor.” The association added that it is mandatory for a chargesheet be filed in the case within three months of suspension. “Since no chargesheet was filed even after seven months, Mandal’s suspension is invalid,” DSCTA head Premendra Kumar Parihar said.
