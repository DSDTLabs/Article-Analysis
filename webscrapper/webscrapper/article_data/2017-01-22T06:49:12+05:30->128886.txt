KORAPUT: Much to the discomfort of the state government, former BJD MP of Koraput   said any government which tries to   has lost the elections and its not possible to put a blanket ban on liquor trade. 

 While accompanying his party candidates to file nominations for the posts of   sub-collector's office recently, Pangi had told a gathering, "I had tried to ban liquor trade and lost the election. Chief ministers like late Biju Patnaik, Jayalalitha and N T Rama Rao were thrown out of power as they banned sale of liquor in their respective states". Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar will also loose the next election as he has   in his state, he added. The former Parliamentarian, who is also the president of BJD's Koraput unit, said, "Liquor is an integral part of tribal life and no one can ban it. Those who demand a ban on liquor are the real consumers of liquor".
 
 However, Congress chief whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati condemned the BJD leader for favouring liquor trade only to win elections at a time when liquor has ruined tribal lives and is the main reason behind social disturbances in the tribal society. 
 
 "It's the real face of the   which is only concerned to remain in power at any cost. It's most unfortunate that Pangi being a tribal himself is favouring liquor trade which has wreaked havoc in tribal lives in the state," he said.
