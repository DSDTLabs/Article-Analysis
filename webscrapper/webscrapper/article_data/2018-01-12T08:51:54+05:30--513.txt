HUBBALLI: Soon, it won’t be so easy for   to undergo a sonography.   or a photo identity card and contact number will be mandatory to undergo the test. Besides, online entry rather than manual entry is a must for sonography centres.

 In the backdrop of recent changes in the guidelines to carry out a sonography test, and strict implementation of the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994 (PCPNDT), in  , soon every entry for a sonography will be online.
 
 To curb cross-border gender determination and female foeticide, and the practice to determine the gender of the foetus and abort female ones, the government is making Aadhaar mandatory for a sonography.
 
 A health department source at Bengaluru said that under the  , the government of Karnataka will be introducing online entry of every woman who undergoes a sonography. “It was intended to be launched on January 1in Karnataka, but due to some technical reasons, the process was a bit delayed. In a week, online entry of every sonography will be introduced and do away with the current practice of manual entry,” he said.
 
 A woman has to produce any one of the 13 photo identity proofs: Aadhaar, driving licence, election voter ID card etc before getting a sonography done, besides a landline or cellphone number. Sonography centres have to upload all details of the women online, and even doctors who refer women for sonography scanning will have official reference slips with details of the doctor’s registration number along with the reason for referring for a sonography test, the source said.
 
 Preparations were on since December 2017 to introduce online entry for sonography scanning. Weeklong training sessions were held for district health officers and technical staff. The State Data Centre has been connected to all sonography centres, and they are functioning on trial and error basis. Karnataka is the first state to strictly implement the online entry system.
