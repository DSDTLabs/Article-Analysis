Surat\Bharuch: A young orthopaedic surgeon of Bharuch Civil Hospital has given a new lease of life to a poor girl suffering from congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (leg bone). 

 Dr Kunal Champaneri conducted a three-hour long surgery on May 12 on 14-year old Ravina Rathod, daughter of farm labourers Maniben and Ramesh Rathod of Kalam village of Vagra taluka in Bharuch district, in which he corrected the position of her leg bones. Till now such a surgery had never been performed in Bharuch Civil Hospital. Such surgeries could cost more than Rs 1 lakh in private hospitals. When her parents went to get disability certificate from him for their daughter, he realized she suffered from congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia.
 
 “Gradual increase in weight tends to bend weakened bones of such patients. Even a minor trauma can lead to fractures. If major deformity is not corrected, it would lead to progression of deformities like shortening of legs, arthritis of knee, arthritis of ankle, degenerative changes in spine etc.” Dr Champneri told TOI.
 
 Dr Champaneri was helped by two nurses. Ravina’s fibula bone and the weight bearing bone of the leg named tibia were broken and the deformity corrected by drilling the bone. Tibia was then fixed with 3.5mm rod. 
 
 “Such a medical condition is seen in one in 2.5 lakh people. It is a rare case. Such an operation was done for the first time in Bharuch. People from this district would not have to go far for treatment of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia,” Dr Champaneri said.
