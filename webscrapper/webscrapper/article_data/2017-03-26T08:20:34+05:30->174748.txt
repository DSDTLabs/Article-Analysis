NEW DELHI: Over one billion mobile phone numbers will have to be linked to their owners’ Aadhaar account in the next one year, which telecom companies say may cost as much as Rs 2,500 crore. 

 “We have been asked by the telecom ministry to start the process of linking mobile numbers/subscribers with their Aadhaar account. Mobile companies will start the process soon,” Rajan Mathews, director-general of   (COAI), told TOI. 
 
 Top service providers such as Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and Reliance Jio are members of COAI. Mathews said that the Supreme Court had sought the linkage to Aadhaar after receiving a public interest litigation (PIL) over having a fool-proof identity verification system in place. 
 
 
  
 
 An official with Idea Cellular said that the companies have started to gear up for the mammoth exercise. “We are looking into this issue on an urgent basis, and trying to find out the best possible solution to implement it.” 
 
 Officials at telecom companies said that it is still being worked out on whether a customer needs to visit a store to verify his/her credentials, or whether it can be done with an SMS or a phone call. 
 
 “The modalities are being worked out, and we plan to begin the process soon,” a top official with a leading telecom operator said. Mathews said that among other things, SIM cards taken on fraudulent papers will not be possible after completion of this exercise.
