VISAKHAPATNAM: The authorities of Andhra   are worried about the dismal results in the  . Vice-chancellor Prof   released the results for the arts, commerce and science programmes on Friday.

 Roughly 300 colleges in   and   districts offer degree courses are affiliated to AU. The authorities pointed that roughly 35,000 students from all the three streams appeared for the examination. The pass percentage was extremely low, so low that only 29.5% of the science stream students passed, while over 27% students from the commerce stream got through. The pass percentage was dismally low in the arts stream, with only 18.4% of the students getting through.
 
 Regarding the reasons for the low pass percentage, the vice-chancellor, Prof G Nageswara Rao observed, “There is no doubt that this is a cause for concern. We need to conduct a full-fledged enquiry and find out why the results are so dismal, especially in the rural areas. But, before that I will ask the comptroller of examinations and the deans to analyse the results thoroughly and submit to me a report at the earliest.”
 
 The registrar, Prof V Uma Maheswara Rao pointed that there was a huge disparity in the performance between students from Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts.
 
  He further added, “We have introduced the semester system for the first time and the poor show could be possibly because of the manner in which the colleges could not adjust to it. More importantly, we need to look at why colleges in rural areas are faring so poorly. This could also be because of the lack of proper teachers and academic facilities in some of the colleges.”
