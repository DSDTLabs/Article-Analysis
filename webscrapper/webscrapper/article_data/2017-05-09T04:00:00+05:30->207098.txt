SURAT: This wall measures just 150-foot lengthwise and nowhere comparable to the  , but still is an invaluable heritage of the city. The wall was discovered at   on Sunday during the digging work for drainage. Archaeological Survey of India ( ) officials said the wall could have been built 200 years ago as a protection against floods.

  (SMC) workers were digging the ground to lay pipeline when JCB machine hit the wall in Madhavnagar of Bhimpore. They informed senior officials and district collector too. The digging continued parallel to the wall which unearthed the 30-foot high and 150-foot long wall. ASI officials in Vadodara were informed and they sent Gautam Krishnamurti, conservation assistant, Surat to the location. The wall is located around five feet from the road in Bhimpore. 
 
 Krishnamurti said, “It looks like a protection wall built some 200 years ago. The bricks used are of modern type with clay. This means the wall is not very old. However, we need to conduct further examination to understand why this wall was built. The probability is it was either a protection for a bunker or to prevent the city from floods. Senior ASI officials Anil Tiwari and Arun Mallik would be visiting the site soon for further examination.” 
 
 An iron pipe was also found from the site. ASI officials said this pipe was inserted much later to flow out drainage water. It does not have much historical value.
