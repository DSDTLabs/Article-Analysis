BENGALURU/ CHIKKAMAGALURU:   on   belonging to former  's son-in-law VG Siddhartha,  , the country's largest coffee retail chain.

 According to I-T sources, searches were conducted in 25 locations across the country, including Bengaluru, Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, Chennai and Mumbai. Coffee Day Enterprises stock slumped 7.5% in morning trade, and recovered later in the day.
 
 Searches were conducted at multiple company premises, including his offices and residence, and are likely to continue for two more days, a source added. Siddhartha has investments in wide range of sectors in India and abroad. Coffee Day Enterprises said in a statement to TOI that they are “a responsible corporate following all norms of corporate governance. We will extend all cooperation with the authorities“.
 
 The raids on Siddhartha come after the I-T department carried out a similar exercise against Karnataka minister DK Shivakumar, a political protégé of Krishna, in early August. This kicked up a storm, with the Congress accusing the BJP-led Union government of misusing investigation agencies to target political opponents.
 
 On Thursday, a team of I-T sleuths swooped down on Coffee Day Square in Bengaluru, the headquarters of Cafe Coffee Day in Bengaluru, and Siddhartha's residence in upscale Sadashivanagar. In Chikkamagaluru, a team of 10 I-T officers carried out an inspection in the Coffee Day Global Ltd office on Mudigere Road of the city.
 
 Another team of officers carried out searches in the offices of the two estates in Mudigere taluk, a residential school office in Chikkamagaluru and Serai Resorts, which belongs to Siddhartha.
 
 IT officers carried out an hour-long inspection in Chethanahalli estate in Mudigere taluk, where Siddhartha's father Gangaiah Hegde and mother Vaasanthi Hegde live. This estate is a Britishera bungalow with a history of 130 years.
