NEW DELHI: The   (CISF) has launched a probe into the lapse in hand baggage checking at   on Thursday which saw a man board a Goa-bound flight with a kitchen knife. 

 Once inside the   aircraft, the man took the knife from his bag and showed it to co-passengers — including minister of state in PMO Jitendra Singh — and said he did this to show the chinks in armour at one of India’s most sensitive airports.
 
 “We have ordered an inquiry and action will be taken against the personnel found responsible,” a CISF spokesman said.
 
 This lapse has been taken seriously as the Union home ministry had on September 1 had asked the airport security agencies to be extra vigilant in view of increased threat perception, including chemical attacks in modes of transport. 
 
 “Further inputs indicate that terrorists remain interested in small arms attack and physical assaults on airports and other transportation hubs… it is advised that security at airports and transportation hubs (railway stations, bus terminals, metro stations etc) be stepped up to ensure stricter screening of items mentioned above and frisking of passengers properly in order to avoid any untoward incident,” the MHA advisory had said.
 
 But within a fortnight of this alert, the lapse at Delhi airport happened on Thursday. Describing this, a SpiceJet spokesman had said, “A passenger on board SG 144 flight from Delhi to Goa reported to the cabin crew that he had a kitchen knife in his hand baggage. The aircraft was at that point still on ground. The SpiceJet staff immediately brought the matter to the attention of the CISF. The passenger was offloaded and handed over to the airport police.”
 
 Passenger frisking and hang bag checking is done by CISF.
