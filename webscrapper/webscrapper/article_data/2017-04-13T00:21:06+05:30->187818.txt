Jaipur: The state government’s portal for redressal of their grievances, ‘Rajasthan Sampark’, has turning out to be an embarrassment to the government. The grievances forwarded to the portal even from the prime minister’s office (PMO) and chief minister’s office (CMO) are not taken seriously by the officials, people complain.

 A compliant to PMO and CMO by Sanjiv Mathur over the delay in the arrest of an absconding builder for over a year who had cheated hundreds of investors with cores of rupees in Jaipur has exposed the Rajasthan   portal. Following the complaints to the highest offices in the country and state, two different complaints were registered at the portal. In both the cases the lackadaisical approaches of the officials have come to light.
 
 Though the Prime minister’s office promptly forwarded the compliant to the officials in the state it has remained in files for over a month. After the complainant sent a remainder to the PMO it has been posted on the portal (grievance Id 03171302166260 on March 6, 2017). But instead of sending the file to the Home department it has been sent to the accounts officer. The accounts officer returned the file with the comment that it was not concerning his department and the file has not moved after that.
 
 A similar complaint to the chief minister’s office, the complaint was promptly registered on the portal (grievance id 02171032125518). Chief Minister’s office sought report in the investigating within seven days, but no report filed even after one month. If this is the fate of the complaint filed at the highest level who could help of the common people?, asks the complainant.
 
 At the budget session of the assembly, MLAs had alleged that Rajasthan Sampark portal is acting as the place to transfer complaints and the harassed people are not really getting relief through the portal.
