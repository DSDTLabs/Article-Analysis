Ludhiana: The byelection in ward number 5 at Payal and ward 17 of Jagraon Municipal Council turned out to be mixed bag for the ruling Congress and the BJP as the parties won one seat each on Saturday. The bypolls for the two wards were necessitated after the death of councillors of these wards.

 From ward number 5 at Payal, Paramjit Kaur, wife of Congress leader Ranjeet Singh, defeated her nearest rival Reena Rani by 214 votes. While Paramjit Kaur got 345 votes, Reena could garner only 131 votes. Three voters chose NOTA.
 
 From ward number 17 of Jagraon, Ashwani Dhir alias Ankush Dhir of BJP defeated his nearest rival Madan Lal Bansal of Congress with a margin of 782 votes. While Ankush secured 1,379 of 1975 polled votes, Madan Lal got only 587 votes whereas nine voters chose NOTA.
 
 Election of ward 5 of Payal Municipal Council was necessitated after the death of former MC president Hardev Singh Matharoo, who had won as an independent candidate. After the last election, the seat was reserved for women candidates. After winning the election, Paramjit Kaur thanked the Congress party and Payal MLA for her win. The councillor said she will work for betterment of the ward.
 
 Election from ward 17 of Jagraon was necessitated after the death of Baldev Krishan Dhir who had died of heart attack a few months ago. Sources said the sympathy wave with the BJP candidate after his fatherâ€™s death and factionalism in Congress within Malkeet Singh Dakha, Geja Ram and MLA Bagha Purana Darshan Singh Brar groups resulted in a crushing defeat of Congress candidate.
 
 After winning the election, Ashwani Dhir said that the win was the biggest tribute to his father. He added that this was for the fifth time (including four times by his father), that his family got an opportunity to serve the ward and he would work for people of his ward.
