Actor   became the second contestant to be evicted from the   house. Vinit along with   and   were in the danger zone. 

 Anil was the first to get into the safe zone. Out of Resham and Vinit, the latter got the least number of votes and hence had to leave the game in the second week. 
 
 As Vinit's name was announced by Bigg Boss Marathi host,  , everyone in the house got teary-eyed.
 
 Vinit had a wonderful journey in the house. He became the first captain of the house.
 
 During his captaincy, the housemates felt that he dominated the house. Then he also used offensive words against Megha during the task 'Khurchi Samrat'. He was even punished by Bigg Boss for not wearing the mic and breaking the rules.
 
 But, Vinit shared a good bond with the housemates. "I will miss Rajesh the most because I was very close to him," said Vinit after his elimination. 
 
 
 After his eviction, he was given a special right and asked to nominate any one person for the coming week's elimination. Vinit nominated Anil Thatte.
