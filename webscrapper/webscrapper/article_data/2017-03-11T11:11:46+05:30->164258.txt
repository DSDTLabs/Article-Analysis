NASHIK: Indian soldier  , who had inadvertently crossed the   a day after the Indian Army carried out surgical strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, will return home for Holi. 

 Chandu, who is from Bor Vihir village in Dhule district, nearly 168km from  , will reach his native place around 11.30am on Saturday from New Delhi. Minister of state (defence) Subhash Bhamre will accompany him. Bor Vihir village will celebrate the festival of colours in the true sense as the son of soil is returning home after nine months.
 
 “We were informed on Thursday that the first phase of Chandu’s interrogation by Indian Army has finished and he has got a month’s leave. He will be reaching home around 2pm on Saturday,” said Chandu’s brother, Bhushan Chavan. 
 
 The 22-year-old soldier from 37 Rashtriya Rifles went missing on September 29 last year as he had inadvertently crossed the Line of Control and stepped into the Pakistan soil. The Pakistan Army immediately took him into captivity. Unable to bear the agonising news, Chandu’s shocked grandmother, Leelabai, died of cardiac failure on October 1. Leelabai had brought up and looked after Chandu after he lost his parents when he was just a toddler. Chandu will also perform the ritual of ‘Asthi Visarjan’ of his grandmother after Holi. 
 
 Pakistan authorities on January 21 returned Chavan via Wagah Border in Punjab as “a gesture of goodwill”. 
 
 After his release, Chavan had told his family that he was brutally tortured and regularly injected with drugs during his four-month captivity. His brother Bhushan, who is also an army jawan posted at   in  , had earlier told TOI that his brother had multiple injuries on his body, especially on the fingers of his right hand.
