 The AP Bhavan complex on Ashoka Road in central Delhi houses the Andhra Pradesh Bhavan, Telangana State Bhavan and Telangana Haj House. The Telangana government has been claiming ownership of the entire 18.88 acre plot in 3 blocks, Godavari, Sabari and Patudi. 
 
 Godavari block has 72 rooms. Sabari block has five suites and two cottages while Patuadi block has huge parcels of land attached to it. There is also a canteen, auditorium and a conference hall. “Our proposal will be that we can take one big block and rest will be with Telangana and vise versa. Whoever takes the block has to pay back the worth of asset in the proportion mentioned in the AP Reorganisation Act 2014. AP has to pay 58 % of the valuation. Telangana has to pay 42 % of the valuation” said a top official present at the meeting.
