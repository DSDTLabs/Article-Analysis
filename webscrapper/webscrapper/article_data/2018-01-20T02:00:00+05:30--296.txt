PATNA: Sanitary napkin vending machines will be installed in the women’s washrooms at the Patna   soon. Such a facility was introduced at the Rajkot airport in Gujarat recently.

 “We think the initiative will be appreciated,” Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria told this newspaper on Thursday.
 
 There are five washrooms for women inside the airport’s terminal building. All these washrooms will have coin-operated sanitary napkin dispensers.
 
 The city airport’s inbound and outbound flyers include a large number of women, including rural women. “It has been seen at times that the women’s washrooms are in unhygienic condition and installing sanitary napkin dispensers will resolve this issue,” Lahauria said.
 
 He said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) would install the sanitary napkin vending machines using its own funds. “We will start working on the proposal after the weather conditions improve as we are these days busy managing the flight operations that have been disrupted due to foggy weather,” Lahauria said.
 
 The city airport handled 20.24 lakh flyers between April and November last year, and the authorities expect the number to reach 30-lakh mark by the end of current financial year on March 31.
