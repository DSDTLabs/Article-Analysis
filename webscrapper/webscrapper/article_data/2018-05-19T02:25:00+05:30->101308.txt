Sharma told him to pay up Rs 5 lakh, failing which he threatened to bump him and his family off, the police said. Kavadiya is a the former minister for panchayat and rural housing and development. 
 
 “The first call to Kavadiya was made on Wednesday. He also sent threatening text messages, following which the BJP leader’s personal assistant approached us. On the basis of his number, we traced him to Anand Nagar in Oshiwara. We laid a trap with the help of the anti-extortion cell of Mumbai police and asked him to come and collect the money. As soon as he came to the spot, we nabbed him,” said sub-inspector   of the crime branch of Ahmedabad police.
