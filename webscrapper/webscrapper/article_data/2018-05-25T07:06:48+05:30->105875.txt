QUEPEM: Amol Kanekar, a councillor of the   (QMC), was arrested on Wednesday evening in connection with a bounced cheque case.

 According to the complaint, Kanekar had issued a cheque to the complainant but could not honour it due to insufficient funds in this bank account. The court of the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC), Quepem, had subsequently directed him to pay the complainant Rs 10 lakh with interest. But when the cheque bounced, the court issued a warrant against Kanekar and directed the Quepem police to arrest him. 
 
 Upon receiving the warrant, the police, led by police inspector  , arrested Kanekar near his home in Quepem town. He was then produced before the court of the JMFC, which directed the police to transfer him to the   central jail till further orders.
 
 However, Kanekar, who was taken for a medical check-up at Hospicio, Margao, on the way to Colvale jail, complained of high blood pressure and was admitted at the hospital with police protection.
 
 Peixoto told TOI the accused would be produced before the court of the JMFC on Monday for a hearing.
