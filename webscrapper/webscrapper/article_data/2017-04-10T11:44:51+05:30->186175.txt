BHUBANESWAR:  , a   by   Amartya Bhattacharya, has been selected for a premiere at the   in Canada starting April 29. 

  A unique art-house festival, the 'Hidden Gems' as the name suggests screens eight unique films from India each year.
 
 "Though Khyanika is a non-commercial film, it has elements which will attract film lovers of all genres. It is at once satirical and sooth," said Bhattacharya. 
 
 This year, the festival organizers have so far announced the world premiere of 'Khyanika -The Lost Idea'. The name of other films are yet to be announced, he said.
 
 The film is a fantasy driven tale of two men, a poet and a painter, claiming possession of the same idea, in a rural village portrayed as a wonderland. Idea is personified as a beautiful young lady, free from all bondage. The two men try to justify their claim over their idea through their forms of art. Unable to settle the conflict, the two men approach 'fate' personified as a big fat man of authority, to judge their claims. They soon realize that idea is no one's possession and it isn't wise to rely on fate for a judgement. They decide to bury their fate, and settle the matter in peace.
 
 The film features Amrita Chowdhury, Susant Misra, Choudhury Bikash Das, Hrushikesh Bhoi and Swastik Choudhury in the lead roles while Anu Choudhury has appeared as a guest performer.
 
 "The film was shot with a DSLR camera and without any industry resources or equipment. It has been shot in and around the peripheries of Bhubaneswar and Puri," said Bhattacharya.
