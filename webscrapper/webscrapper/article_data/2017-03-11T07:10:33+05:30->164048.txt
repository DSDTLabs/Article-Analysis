MUMBAI: A group of 135 passengers, who had bought tickets on an IndiGo return flight between  , has found out days before their travel that that the airline had messed up their travel plan. 

 The group had planned a pilgrimage to   shrine. On December 10, 135 seats were booked on the Indore-Delhi-Jammu flight scheduled on March 11. The group was to reach Vaishno Devi on the night of March 11, visit the shrine the next morning and on the same day, take a return flight to Indore leaving Jammu at 4.15 pm.
 
 "We learnt last evening (March 9) that IndiGo had booked 40 of the 135 passengers on a different flight from Jammu. Instead of the 4.15 pm departure that they had been booked on, the airline moved them to an earlier flight scheduled to depart at 1.35 pm,'' said Puneet Agarwal, a businessman from Indore who had booked the seats. "This leaves us with barely any time to visit the shrine in the morning. What's the point of the trip then?" he said, adding that the airline changed their flights without informing them. "We wanted to make a complaint to a nodal officer or an adjudicator. But when we call on the number listed by the airline, the call gets transferred to customer care." 
 
  TOI sent a questionnaire to IndiGo, but there was no response from the airline till the time of going to the press. 
 
 Santosh Patidar, the travel agent who did the bookings, said that soon after these seats were booked in December, IndiGo had done the same thing. "It was not a group booking. When they changed the flights, we contacted the airline but they directed us to their call centre. But finally the matter was sorted out," said Patidar. "IndiGo had confirmed that the passengers would be put on the 4.15 pm Jammu-Delhi flight, as we had bought tickets for this flight. But now barely two days before the travel date, they have sprung this surprise on us."
