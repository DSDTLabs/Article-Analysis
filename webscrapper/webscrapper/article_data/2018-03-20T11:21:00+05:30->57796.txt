Pretty actress   is finally married and now there is photo proof for that. While we had earlier reported about her marriage news, she and her family denied the news and there weren't any leaked photos of the wedding too, since it was very close to family event. But now after the marriage, a couple of photos and videos of the beautiful couple have surfaced on social networking sites. 

 Shriya Saran, who was last seen in   in ‘Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan’, apparently got hitched to her boyfriend   yesterday. The couple along with friends and family had their 'Haladi' ceremony and even a Holi party on the 18th of March before the 'Sangeet' in the evening. 
  
  
 Andrei is a national-level tennis player and entrepreneur, owning a restaurant chain in Moscow, Russia. The wedding was a very private affair and the ceremony apparently took place at her residence in Mumbai. 
 
 We wish the couple a happy married life.
