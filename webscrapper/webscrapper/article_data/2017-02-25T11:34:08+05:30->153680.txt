NAGPUR: Shanti Nagar police on Thursday registered an offence against ex-corporator  , who contested as an independent from ward number 21, for rioting and obstructing government officials. Congress candidates   and   too have been booked along with over 250 supporters. A woman officer was among the cops injured when these groups resorted to stone pelting.

 Shanti Nagar police had a tough time tackling the protesting political activists at Satranjipura zone office when winners were declared in ward number 21. As the protesters started demanding a recount, the names of the winners were declared, adding fuel to the pent up tension. As the cops intervened to ensure the protesters were kept at bay from the counting centre, they started targeting cops on duty. 
 
 Woman sub-inspector  , who was on duty near the counting centre, was injured when some protesters started hurling stones. She received injuries on the right hand. Despite being injured, Yadav staved off the attack with her colleagues. Some scribes, including an TOI intern, too were targeted as cops unleashed tough measures on the mob in a subsequent action to shield counting officials inside the centre. “The supporters may have genuine issues, but targeting cops only led to the chaos,” said WPSI Yadav.
 
 In another incident, Sakkardara police registered an offence against culprits identified as Irshad and his accomplices for targeting Mustaq Rizvi Mohd Shafi Rizvi. Irshad and others tried to barge into the residence of Rizvi family at Thakur Plot near   after the counting on Thursday, holding them responsible for the loss of the Congress candidate in the civic election. Irshad and his accomplices damaged the front door of the house and also a two-wheeler parked in the vicinity.
 
 An offence was also registered against three unidentified persons at Nandanvan police station, on Thursday, for attempting to set afire a Starbus and pelting stones at the vehicle.
