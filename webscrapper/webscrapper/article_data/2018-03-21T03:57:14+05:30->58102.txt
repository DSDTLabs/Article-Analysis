MUMBAI: State legislative council chairman Ramraje Nimbalkar on Tuesday told the government to   Navi Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale and DCP Tushar Doshi if they had issued written permission to file an FIR against   Jayant Patil, a PWP leader. 

 The issue pertains to a cheating complaint lodged against Raigad District Central Cooperative Bank’s chairman, director and branch manager. Patil is the chairman of the bank. 
 
 Patil raised the issue in the legislative council on Tuesday and said, “They gave letters to file an FIR against me while the session is going on.” He said the complaint has been filed by a borrower but the chairman has nothing to do with loan recovery. 
 
 Opposition leader Dhananjay Munde too urged the chairman to look into the matter. “How can the police file an FIR against a member of the House while the session is going on,” questioned Munde. 
 
 “The competent authority should inform us before filing an FIR,” said Anant Kalse principal secretary of the legislature. tnn
