KOZHIKODE: Amid charges that Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital authorities in New Delhi tried to suppress the news of death of   MP, the family of the veteran parliamentarian has said that the action was ‘unethical’.

 Speaking to media at their residence in Kannur, daughter of Ahamed, Dr   said that the hospital turned down their repeated requests to see her father and did not even consult the family before taking decisions on medical procedures.
 
 “They used a chest compression device (AutoPulse) on my father for around 12 hours. Usually the device is used for around 30 minutes or maximum 40, beyond which there is not much chance of survival. Simultaneously they had connected him to a ventilator as well. Using the compression device for long can result in rib fracture and it could have happened,” said Fouzia, a doctor based in UAE.
 
 She added that finally when the family was allowed to meet him Ahamed’s face was heavily swelled, for which the doctors gave an explanation that it was subcutaneous emphysema. “We were hurt to see him like that,” Fouzia said.
 
 Saying that the hospital owes a proper explanation, she asked, “Why did they do this? We were pleading with them. Still they did not discuss anything with us.”
 
 Family sources said that the hospital authorities wanted to put Ahamed on ECMO but they did not discuss about it with the kin who were available at the hospital. The family came to know that the hospital authorities did not conduct brain stem function test before deciding to conduct ECMO procedures. The relatives had questioned it and the test was done later.
