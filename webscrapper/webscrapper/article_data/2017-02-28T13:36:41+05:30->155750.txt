BHOPAL: Passengers going to   can now drive-in right to the platform number 6. The much-awaited facility, that was previously limited only to  , has been thrown open to all other passengers as well on Monday. 

 The facility will benefit over 1,000 people who come to the station to catch a train or drop their relatives. 
 
 Work on the drive-in facility was started in August last year, after the Simhastha fair concluded. Now land available near the abandoned building of   near platform 6, will be thrown open for parking for two and four-wheelers. Presently, the parking is limited only for four-wheelers. 
 
 BMC had acquired the land last year for making arrangements for Simhastha visitors and to provide them shelter. After the fair concluded in May, the acquisition had affected 3,000 passengers each day, who found no place to park their vehicles along the platform. Since then, such regular passengers had no option but to park their vehicles on platform number one and walk all the way to platform number 6.
 
 Claiming ownership of the land, BMC maintained that it has not yet handed over the land to the Railways. However, in view of the inconvenience caused to the passengers, the Railways railways threw open the parking facility claiming ownership of the land. Spokesperson for  , I A Siddiqui said, “The parking has been opened for public since Monday morning and now there is no confusion of over ownership of any land.”
 
 Charges for parking will be same as platform 1 parking. 
 
 Previous to this a temporary parking was aloted under a shade near booking office for daily passengers.
