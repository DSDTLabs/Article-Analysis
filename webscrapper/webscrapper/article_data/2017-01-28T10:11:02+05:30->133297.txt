JALANDHAR: Prime Minister   on Friday projected demonetisation as his major step taken against black money and declared that he would continue the fight against corruption in politics.

 Addressing his first rally in Punjab after the assembly polls were announced, Modi said, “We are fighting against corruption. Some people are very upset as they are set to lose what they deposited from loot of 70 years. They are still not coming to terms with it and they attack me whenever they get opportunity. But these politicians must understand that I have taken up the fight against corruption in political life and it will continue”.
 
 “This fight against corruption and black money will not stop. For me this is not a political issue but for me this is an important task to build future of the country and its people,” he added.
 
 Taking a dig at Congress, he said, “during UPA regime from 2012 to 2014 people would read headlines what amount had gone in scams, how much was lost in coal, how much was lost in 2G but after demonetisation people get the news what is coming (to government coffers)” .
 
 “In   more than Rs 150 crore was recovered from residence of a minister in Congress government. New currency notes of Rs 150 crore were recovered but neither Congress is thinking to remove him nor TV media is discussing it and things are appearing as if nothing has happened. These people who looted are very powerful, so this silence. Now tell me how difficult is the fight against corruption and can I fight without your support,” he said.
