  Nenu Local is a Telugu action-romantic film directed by Trinadha Rao Nakkina and produced by Dil Raju under his banner Sri Venkateswara Creations, story, screenplay and dialogues are written by Prasanna Kumar Bejawada. It features Nani and Keerthy Suresh in the lead roles. Music is composed by Devi Sri Prasad. The trailer of the film was launched on 14 January 2017.
 
 It's a love story of 'Babu gadu' (Nani) who is pakka local guy and how he gets to impress his lady love and her parents.
 
 
  Nenu Local is incredibly predictable. If not for Naniâ€™s comedy timing and skill to keep audiences glued to the seats, the movie would have had nothing much to offer. Set that aside, and it would border on boring. Nenu Local rides on Nani and nothing more. Watch it for him.
