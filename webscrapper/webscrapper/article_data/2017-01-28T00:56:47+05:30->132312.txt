 Coimbatore: Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S Thirunavukarasar has demanded the union government to immediately sanction Rs 70,000 crore as a   fund for drought and cyclone.
 
 Addressing the reporters at the Coimbatore International Airport, Thirunavukarasar said that the state government has demanded the Centre to sanction Rs 70,000 crore (39,565 crore for drought) for the natural calamities. Though the state has asked more than three times, the Centre did not sanction any fund and its committee is still analyzing Tamil Nadu’s demand, he said.
 
 “The Union government should allot enough funds for the state as it is facing a major drinking water crisis. Already, we met the president Pranab Mukherjee regarding the issue. The Centre should consider the welfare of Tamil Nadu people and sanction the amount,” he said. 
 
 He also condemned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for refusing to meet the Tamil Nadu MPs. The Centre also failed to form the Cauvery River Water Management Board. Its activities are indirectly suppressing Tamil Nadu. “The union government should allow the state government to work independently,” he added.
