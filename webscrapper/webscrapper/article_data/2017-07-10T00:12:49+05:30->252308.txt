NAGPUR: After suffering two defeats in a row,   made a comeback in his second tournament of the   at Catalonia, Spain, on Sunday.

 The 50-year-old utilized his opening advantage with the white pieces well to trap Spain's   (WFM)   in their fifth round battle of the nine-day   tournament.
 
 With this win, city's lone International Master (IM) collected 2.5 points at the halfway mark of the nine-round tournament.
 
 Despite losing back-to-back rounds, the 31st board battle between Deshmukh and Alfonso saw a positive start from the city IM. In the mid-game, however, Deshmukh missed a move to exchange his pieces but stretched the game further by complicating the things.
 
 The Spanish WFM failed to utilize the mid-game blunder by Deshmukh and got trapped by her Indian opponent. She came a bit under time-pressure allowing Deshmukh to regain the momentum. Alfonso resigned in the 42nd move.
 
 A relaxed Deshmukh after garnering full point, said, "I was already demoralised the way things went in my earlier rounds as I missed some easy moves to lose two previous rounds. Up against a WFM with 2000+ rating and with the white pieces I managed to play confidently."
 
 He added, "I started with the English Opening and was well on course for a crushing victory. Suddenly, I missed a simple Bishop Exchange move and was upset with myself. I then started overlooking her ideas and at one stage, precisely, after 28 moves I was in the worst position."
 
 "Here, I started thinking of survival but decided to go for complicating the game. My idea worked as Alfonso came under time pressure. From here I regained my momentum and finished the game finally in 42 moves," he said.
 
 In the sixth round on Monday, Deshmukh will defend with the black pieces against Women International Master (WIM) Fuentes Godoy Lilia Ivonne of Mexico on the 25th board.
