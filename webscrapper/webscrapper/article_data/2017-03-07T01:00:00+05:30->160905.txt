 has filed a police complaint against a restaurant owner in Delhi, accusing him and his bouncers of assaulting her and some of her family members. The incident took place on Saturday night, when Aanchal, her brother and cousins visited a restaurant in   for dinner. The quiet evening took a violent turn soon after she paid the bill by card. Aanchal was aghast when the waiter told her that they had misplaced her debit card. After paying by cash, she took up the matter with the owner of the restaurant. That’s when things turned ugly. 

  says, “I was shocked when they told me that they had lost my card. I told the owner that they should be careful and that seemed to have hurt his ego. He, his younger brother and some bouncers followed us out and started arguing. When one of them abused me, my brother intervened and reprimanded him, holding him by his collar for misbehaving with a woman. He and his men then started hitting us. My cousin fell down on her face and sustained deep bruises. When I dialled 100, they fled from the scene. They are now claiming that they were rushed to the hospital after being hit brutally by us!”
 
 However,  , the restaurant owner, has refuted the allegation. He says, “Aanchal is a dear friend and we have partied together on several occasions. I can’t fathom why she has blown the incident out of proportion. In fact, she and her brother were dancing on the table and the bouncer politely requested them to step down. We did misplace the card, which was a genuine error. She called me outside and I told her to end the matter. I have been in this business since over a decade and can’t think of hitting a woman. The   footage clearly shows that nobody was hit. Let the law take its course.”
 
 A police source informs us, “We have got hold of the CCTV footage and are investigating the matter.”
