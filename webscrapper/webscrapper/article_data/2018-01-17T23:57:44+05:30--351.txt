Hyderabad: Location-based technology solutions provider player   is gearing up to drive in two-wheeler navigation solutions and is simultaneously working on rolling out an alternative to Google Maps for the consumer segment.

 The company is already working with auto majors in the country to enable embedded navigation systems for two-wheelers on the lines of that currently being provided in cars, MapmyIndia managing director Rakesh Verma told newspersons on Wednesday. According to Verma, MapmyIndia has developed the software for the two-wheeler navigation systems and is working with a bunch of auto manufacturers and their OEs (hardware makers for the navigation system) to roll out the offering over the next couple of months. On catering to the consumer segment with its digital maps, he said the company feels its maps are better than Google Maps and hopes to roll out this offering over next couple of months. 
 
 “We have been so far focused on monetising the corporate segment but have not yet done so in the consumer space. With our new offering too we don’t expect to monetise the consumer segment and for the time being will be subsidising it through our offerings for the government and corporate sector,” Verma said. On Wednesday, the 23-year-old Delhi-based MapmyIndia, which is eyeing revenues of Rs 150-200 crore in FY18, also announced the launch of its MapmyIndia Map Engine, a solution designed to geo-enable applications and solutions with faster turnaround time.
