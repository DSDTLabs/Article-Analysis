PATNA: Principal additional advocate general Lalit Kishore has written to the law department, urging it to take action against additional public prosecutor (APP) Rajendra Singh Sashtri, against whom the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has lodged an FIR for forging documents to help drug peddlers and murder accused seek bail.

 Senior advocate N K Agarwal and Nandu, a clerk, are the other accused in the FIR lodged by CBI on October 5 last year.
 
 Kishore said the government advocate has been barred from taking cases. “I have sent a letter to the law department to take necessary action against him,” he added. However, Shashtri and Agarwal would continue to practise till the time state bar council takes step against them.
 
 In June 2016, Sashtri and Agarwal had taken up the case of three drug peddlers – Subodh Kumar Singh, Nawal Kumar Sahni and Noor Alam – who were arrested by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths on May 16, 2015, with 277kg ganja. The advocates allegedly helped the trio seek bail from the court of Justice Shivaji Pandey by forging court documents on June 2 last year. Instead of 277kg, the court was told that only 7kg of ganja was seized.
 
 CBI (Patna) S P Rohit Kapoor said Sashtri’s involvement has also surfaced in another similar case in which murder accused were granted bail by   high court in June last year. The SP said while one of the accused in the drug smuggling case had surrendered, the others are still evading arrest.
