MUMBAI: Leader of the   Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil in a letter to the CM has claimed wrong depiction of J&K in the   geography   on Page 24. He also said the colour of the Ashoka Chakra was wrong on Page 9. 

 Textbook bureau officials rejected the contention. “The image on Page 24 is not a map but a digital elevated model of the country to show the physiographic divisions. 
 
 The image is tilted so students can see the Himalayas,” said Ravikiran Jadhav, cartographer and special officer for the subject. A note in the book says the colour of the Tricolour on page 9 may vary due to technical limitations.
