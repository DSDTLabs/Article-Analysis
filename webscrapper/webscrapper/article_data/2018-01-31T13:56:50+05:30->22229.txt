Nagpur: At a time when Indian Railways is going for modernization, the   local under   (SECR) may be perhaps the only train in the region to cover 40km distance in over 4 hours.

 The Nagpur-Ramtek local makes three trips in a day and there have been frequent complaints from commuters that the train is meted out step-motherly treatment.
 
 “I have been travelling in the local since the time when it used to run on a steam engine. During those days, the train operated in time. Now that electric and diesel locos are there, it is always late,” said  , a farmer and social worker residing in Shanti Nagar.
 
 In his complaint, Akre has pointed out that the train is held up on rotation at Kanhan, Kamptee and   stations for hours together.
 
 Akre, a regular traveller, said, “Sample this: The train leaves Itwari at 7.15pm and covers 39km distance in an hour. From  , it again starts at 9.30pm for Nagpur and there is no fixed time to reach the city. The train reaches only after 12.30am and further.” 
 
 “The SECR is running the train as a liability. There is ample scope to improve the coaches and operate it like a tourist train to the temple town where many people visit Ram Mandir, Khindsi, Kalidas memorial, Nagardhan Fort, Ram Dham, Nagarjun hills, and Pench among other places,” says Anantram Joshi.
 
 SECR senior divisional operating manager (SrDOM) Sachin Sharma says the train is mostly held up between Itwari and Nagpur to allow goods trains to pass. “We have mooted a proposal to operate the train between Itwari and Ramtek to overcome delays. There are no passengers for Nagpur in this train,” he said.
 
 Railway officials admit the train is a liability. The delay is caused as priority is given to other mail/express trains. It is held up in Kanhan as it is a busy station with the local train criss-crossing both up and down lines where there is continuous movement.
