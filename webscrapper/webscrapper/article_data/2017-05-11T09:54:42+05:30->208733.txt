KOLKATA: Ever since   passed away ,   has been extremely vocal about   for her. Nil said the actor ought to have been much more responsible than what he has been.

 According to Nil, “On  , every recent post of Sonika was about or with Vikram.“
 
 What has upset Nil a lot is the `changing versions' of Vikram. “He got himself admitted to a hospital, appointed lawyers and went into `nocomments' mode for six days. Then he came out of the hospital, applied for bail, called a press conference where he publicly rejected all the allegations,“ he said.
 
 The sight of   was too much for Nil to bear. “It was heart-breaking to see Sonika's parents standing next to the coffin.They had lost their only daughter and yet, they didn't shed tears there while Vikram was crying at the press conference,“ he pointed out.
 
 Nil insists that it would have been better had Vikram himself called up Sonika's parents. “Instead, he started shooting and when word spread about that, he went to record his statement with the cops.“
 
 He said: “In these days of grief, it's highly insensitive of Vikram's friends to be talking about his relationship with Sonika. This is causing a lot of distress to Sonika's parents.“
 
 Nil doesn't want to get into the drunk driving issue. “But I know he was speeding. His car got hit twice. Had Vikram told the truth, I would have run a `Forgive Vikram' campaign. But I can't do that now,“ he said.
