PANAJI: A day after deputy speaker and   MLA   hit out at former Calangute legislator Agnelo  , the latter reiterated that Lobo was involved in massive irregularities surrounding the drafting of the Calangute-Candolim outline development plan (ODP).

 Fernandes went on to allege that Lobo had included around 100 non-existent structures in the draft ODP plan, that are located in orchard land or hill slopes. “He is charging between Rs one to two crores to include such structures. This land is then sold to outsiders for a price.” Fernandes said. Addressing the media, Fernandes said that he has evidence which he would bring out in the public domain to show that Lobo had been gifted a Rs 2 crore house for permitting luxury homes to be built in land not marked as settlement. He insisted that the entire Calangute-Candolim ODP process was a money making racket, and could be a Rs 200-300 crore scam.
 
 On Wednesday, Lobo said the first applicant to apply for land conversion with the   was Agnelo Fernandes. “They were taking money and allowing them to build whatever they wanted, which is how all these large resorts have come up. The NGPDA has not given any permissions,” Lobo said referring to Fernandes.
