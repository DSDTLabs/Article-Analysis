HYDERABAD: Prof   on Friday set the cat among   announcing that “remaining silent forever is not possible” and hinted that he was not averse to joining active politics saying “when present politics do not serve the people, then alternatives have to be thought of.”

 He was answering a question during a live interview on Facebook on Friday evening. When pressed by the interviewer if this meant that he will definitely enter active politics, Prof   said a decision has not been taken yet, adding “I will have to give it thought.” 
 
 Prof Kodandaram, however, made it clear that the Telangana JAC will not become a political party. “The JAC will never become a party. Its activities are apolitical and are aimed at taking up public interest issues,” he said.
 
 Referring to the February 22 rally by the unemployed, the focus of the interview on the social media platform, Prof Kodandaram called on youth and others to arrive at the   in the city for the march to Indira Park in support of the demand that the government fill the 1.07 lakh vacancies.
 
 The rally, he said, must be peaceful and no one should get provoked. “The more peaceful it is, the stronger the message it will send to the government,” he said. 
 
 He also demanded that the government announce a ‘recruitment calendar’ that was promised by the TRS. Alleging political interference in filling up of vacancies, he said the announcements on recruitments have become political tools for the government and were being used for political gain.
