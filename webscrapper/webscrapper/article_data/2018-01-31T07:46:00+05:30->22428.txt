Chandigarh: Private schools across Haryana were closed on Tuesday in protest with the teachers and principals seeking teachers’ safety norms by the state government in the wake of the killing of principal of Swami Vivekanand Public School, Yamunanagar, by a Class XII student.

 The shut-down was observed on a call given by the Federation of Private Schools’ (Welfare) Association. The federation representatives headed by president Kulbhushan Sharma also submitted a memorandum to state health minister Anil Vij and Yamunanagar deputy Commissioner for the chief minister.
 
 According to information, the federation members apprised Anil Vij of the problems being faced by the managements of private schools in the state. Vij assured them to take up their case with Khattar and education minister Ram Bilas Sharma.
 
 “Our main demand is CBI probe into the entire incident. Secondly, the state government must consider demands made by the school managements of making them party while forming any policy for private schools. We are the major stake holders and are being looked upon as the defaulters, when it comes to framing of the policies,” said Kulbhushan Sharma.
 
 “The government must come out with standard operating procedure that could provide the safety and security of teaching and non teaching staff in the schools, especially in private schools,” he added.
