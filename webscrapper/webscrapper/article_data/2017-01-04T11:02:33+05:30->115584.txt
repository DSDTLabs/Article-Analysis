PANAJI: Stepping up the pressure on the government to check the spate of burglaries in the state, well-known Goan singer   on Monday took to   to get his message across. Through a video appeal uploaded on the popular social networking site, Buyao, whose own Gogol-based residence was recently burgled, appealed to victims of such cases to come together as a group in order to get the government to act.

 “There seems to be a nexus between some policemen and the thieves. The night our home was burgled, the police took over an hour to arrive when the distance is barely ten minutes away. The government has no control over   any more. Citizens are vulnerable,” he said.
 
 The singer also claimed to have dashed off a message to Union defence minister  , stating that he had promised safety under the   regime and failed. 
 
 “He (Parrikar) called back demanding to know what had happened, so I told him there was a robbery at my residence. He replied with an ‘eh’ and hung up. This shows his apathy towards the perils of Goans. Parrikar now only looks at terrorists as serious criminals; thieves are small-time for him,” Buyao lashed out.
 
 Buyao claimed his house was burgled on the intervening night of December 29 and 30 by four to six culprits. 
 
 Upon subsequent inquiries with neighbours and friends, he learnt that one of his acquaintances, who was returning from a party, had observed six people running through the area with a cricket bat in hand at around that time. 
 
 “There was a bat stolen from our house, among other things, proving that those very men were the thieves. They could have been nabbed had the police arrived earlier,” he said.
 
 Recently, the residence of noted actor Varsha Usgaonkar, was burgled in Miramar. Her father, a former minister, and her mother were present in the house when the caretaker decamped with cash and valuables.
