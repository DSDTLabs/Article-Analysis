Rationalists may have had ideological differences with the Kanchi mutt. But, on Wednesday, they chose to forget them and were at the forefront in expressing condolences over the death of Kanchi Sankara mutt seer Jayendra  .

 Leading the rationalists was Dravidar Kazhagam president,  . “Dravidar Kazhagam may have had a mountain of difference with the Kanchi seer and the mutt. But, we express our deep-felt condolence on the passing away of the 83-year-old Jayendra Saraswathi,” Veeramani said in a statement. DMK working president M K   expressed shock over the sudden passing away of the seer. “I express my deep condolences to the departed soul and to his followers and employees of the mutt,” Stalin said in a statement.
 
  
  
 
 Though not a rationalist, PMK founder S   said the Kanchi seer strove to reach out to the masses through educational and healthcare institutions. He also recalled the acharya’s role in trying to resolve the vexatious Ram Janmabhoomi dispute.
 
 Being a rationalist,   (MNM) founder and actor   chose to issue a condolence statement, but without his name. “The organisation president of MNM expresses deep condolences to the departed soul and the followers,” it read.
