Chandigarh: Former Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) presidents on Monday signed a resolution stating that the governance reforms agenda must be taken with an “open mind”. Former PUTA presidents including Prof Akshay Kumar, who had also drafted governance reforms during his tenure, is also among the signatories.

 “The governance structure is based on the Panjab University Act-VII of 1947. The demands of higher education have since changed in a significant way. PUTA has, over the years, raised the issue of necessary reforms to meet the new imperatives of higher education. New disciplines, faculties and departments have changed PU’s landscape. With the emergence of private players and renewed demands of autonomy in decision-making, the present governance structure has out-lived its role. Reforms are urgent and any delay in the exercise would make us irrelevant in the days to come,” stated the resolution.
 
 It further highlighted, “As a dynamic body, the university must show its capacity to self-reflect and press for changes. We, the past presidents of PUTA, hereby, demand that the reform agenda must be taken forward with an open mind. While we acknowledge the seminal role that the senate and syndicate have played over the years, we, at the same time, do feel that given the new ecology of higher education, we must not hesitate in accepting the need of reforms.”
 
 This comes two days after an uproar was created in the syndicate meeting when the members had demanded withdrawal of the affidavit filed by vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover on the governance reforms in the university.
