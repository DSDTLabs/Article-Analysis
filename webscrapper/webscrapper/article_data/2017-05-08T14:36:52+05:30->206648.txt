CHENNAI:   working president M K Stalin on Monday demanded that   Governor C Vidyasagar Rao order a probe into the alleged corrupt dealings of   ministers and former chief minister O  .

 Reacting to reports of the income tax department writing a letter to chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan mentioning the names of AIADMK ministers, MLAs and officials found in the sand mining baron Sekhar Reddy's diary, Stalin said: "The letter has brought to light the dealings the AIADMK government has had with Reddy in its more than five years of rule." 
 
 Stalin demanded that the Governor order a probe into Panneerselvam’s alleged involvement in an insurance scheme scandal. A Tamil weekly carried an article saying there were allegations that the former chief minister had favoured a few insurance companies for the government’s medical insurance scheme.
 
 The DMK leader said several important anti-corruption department posts were vacant and the government had not accepted demands to appoint a Lok Ayuktha in the state. 
 
 "The vigilance department is headless and a DGP-level officer has not been appointed as director for the department yet and there is no separate IAS official to head the department. Thus virtually there is no official to sanction probe into the charges against the ministers," said Stalin.
 
 PMK has also demanded immediate action against the ministers and officials named by the I-T department. In a statement, PMK founder S Ramadoss said the chief secretary, who is an honest official, should not delay in ordering a probe into the charges.
