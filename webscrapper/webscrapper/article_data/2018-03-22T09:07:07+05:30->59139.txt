RAMGARH: In the first sentencing in a case related to violence on the pretext of cow protection, a fast-track court in Jharkhand awarded life imprisonment on Wednesday to 11 convicts, including BJP’s Ramgarh district media in-charge Nityanand Mahto, for lynching  , a meat trader, in June last year.

 While the 11were found guilty under various sections of the IPC last week, the 12th person involved in the lynching is a minor and the prosecution has asked the juvenile justice board (JJB) to treat him as an adult as he is over 16 years of age and “was aware of the impact of his actions”. This plea is pending with the board. 
  
 
 
 Apart from Mahto, the convicted include three members of the local gau raksha samiti — Santosh Singh, Deepak Mishra and  . The others are Vicky Sao, Sikandar Ram, Vikram Prasad, Raju Kumar, Rohit Thakur, Kapil Thakur and Uttam Ram. Fast-track court judge   found all guilty under various IPC sections, including 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), and 149 (unlawful assembly).
 
 
 
 
 
 While prosecution lawyer S K Shukla said he had demanded capital punishment for the 11 convicts, saying their offence fell in the “rarest of the rare category”, defence counsel Sanjeev Ambastha had prayed to the court to award the minimum punishment to the guilty as they had no previous criminal record.
 
 Reacting to the development, Ansari’s family said they were satisfied with the verdict.
 
 Ansari, a 55-year-old meat trader from Manua village under Giddi police station in Ramgarh district, barely 50km from the state capital Ranchi, was lynched by a mob on June 29, 2017 for allegedly carrying beef in his car. The victim’s wife, Mariyam Khatoon, had filed an FIR at the Ramgarh town police station against 17 people and investigating officer   filed a chargesheet against 12.
