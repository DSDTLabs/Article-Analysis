PANAJI: The excise department has started notifying 3,200 licensed   vends located in prohibited areas to close their businesses in view of the   order to ban sale of liquor within 500 metres of all national and state highways. 

 Excise commissioner Menino D’Souza said he has directed inspectors to notify all licensees within the prohibited area to close operations.
 
 The department has not renewed the 3,200 licences, though licensees have been told they will able to continue operations provided they shift beyond the prohibited area.
 
 D’Souza said they did not issue notices earlier because the government had taken a stand that the   order did not apply to hotels, bars and wholesale trades and only 768 retails outlets in prohibited areas would have to go. “But in its latest order on Friday, the apex court clarified that all licensees in prohibited areas have to shut operations,” D’Souza said. Since many licensees in the prohibited area continued operations post the SC order, D’Souza said they are now being intimated that they should stop sale of liquor. D’Souza said the department’s flying squads are keeping a watch to ensure that the order is not violated.
 
 A source, however, said excise department is not cracking down on violators as stringently as it should have been. There are no specific directions to exercise lenience, but considering the sentiments, the department is threading carefully,” he said.
