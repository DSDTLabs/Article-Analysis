GHAZIABAD: The   (PVVNL) has lost around Rs 8 crore because of power thefts between April 2017 and January this year and has been able to recover Rs 2.4 crore, data released by the distribution utility has revealed.

 Over the past 10 months, PVVNL has lodged 3,271 FIRs and fined 449 consumers. Officials said they conducted raids mostly in the wee hours or late in the evening when people are likely to be asleep.
 
 “The FIRs have been registered against the offenders under sections 135 ( ) and 138B (illegally reconnecting power line) of the Electricity Act,” said  , the PVVNL chief engineer of   zone.
 
 Official data revealed that over 56,000 power connections were checked over the past 10 months and discrepancies were found in 3,601 cases. The maximum number of cases —1, 059 — has been registered in Loni area, followed by Meerut Road (561) and Vijay Nagar (487).
 
 “The department is following a zero-tolerance policy against power theft. Our survey has revealed that the thefts are mainly taking place in rural areas and on the outskirts. We have increased our vigilance. Besides registering FIRs, we are also encouraging violators to take legal connections. Violators can save themselves from criminal proceedings after paying the compounding charges,” Chaudhary said.
 
 To ensure that offenders do not get away, the department has been conducting the raids early in the morning. “The raids are being conducted in the early hours of the morning when people are sleeping in their homes. The aim is not to allow them leave home before the raid,” he added.
 
 Uttar Pradesh has been struggling to cope with increasing cases of power thefts over the decade. The Yogi Aditya Nath government had last year announced that people caught with illegal power connections could face a jail term of up to five years, which would be doubled for the second offence. However, no person has been arrested for this offence in Ghaziabad so far.
