NOIDA: The   will soon invite   for four major projects—the waste-to-energy plant in Sector 123, onsite remediation of waste on existing sites, door-to-door waste collection and increase in waste segregation by creating awareness about management of solid waste rules.

 The Authority has been preparing the final request for proposal document for the waste-to-energy plant for which work is likely to start in Sector 123 within two months once the firm is selected, officials said.
 
 ACEO R K Mishra told TOI that the NGT and the Allahabad high court have allowed the Authority to proceed with the project, which earlier faced objections from the residents of sectors around the chosen site in Sector 123. 
 
 “The final tender invites will be issued by this week and it will take around two months for the process to finish, following which we will be able to start the work,” he said.
 
 A private agency will be hired for door-to-door collection of waste to the dustbins and finally the landfill sites till the waste to energy plant comes up. About 600 metric tonnes of solid waste is generated in Noida on a daily basis. This is currently being dumped in landfill sites, including those in Sector 138A and 54.
 
 Officials said tenders will also be invited for onsite remediation of waste at these pre-existing sites till the Sector 123 plant starts operating. “One agency will be hired which will help treat the garbage at these sites using latest technology till the plant is operational,” Mishra said.
 
 Lastly, an NGO will be roped in for creating awareness about the management of solid waste (MSW) rules and the need to segregate waste at home.
