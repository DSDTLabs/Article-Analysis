As an animation expert,   began his career working as a computer graphic artist for Kannada cinema, during which time he also gained a fair bit of editing and cinematography experience. A film lover, Amar was emboldened by his professional expertise to make short films, each of which won him some recognition. One of his short films, caught the attention of producer SV Narayana of Yes Vee Entertainment, who offered Amar the chance to make a movie. The young director says that his first mandate was that he would not make a formulaic commercial entertainer, which Narayana was OK with and that’s how   came about.
The thriller, says Amar, is his interpretation of the events surrounding the attack of a woman at an ATM in Bengaluru. In the lead are a bunch of newcomers, including  , Hemalatha, Shobitha and  , along with  , who, as the villain and perpetrator of the crime, is the focus of the film.
 “The film is a thriller from start to finish. Suryaa’s depiction of the psycho criminal who attacked the woman in the ATM is the highlight of Attempt To Murder. He barely has any lines in the film and has to express himself with his body language, the way he looks and reacts to people, etc. The rugged persona we created for the villain will get audiences to sit back and take note. In fact, so powerful is the character that he even gets a song in the film. Vinay plays a special officer in charge of cracking the case and his investigation into the incident and interactions with Suryaa are to look out for, along with Hemalatha in the role of a reporter,” explains Amar.
 The young director also says that what he is confident is that Attempt To Murder is a technically-sound film with a solid screenplay. “I had written this film before the real-life culprit was apprehended, which then happened while we were shooting. However, we have retained the climax that was part of the original script, which will be very different and not what the audience expects it to be,” Amar signs off.
