CHENNAI: The Chennai division of   is gearing up to induct 3-phase electric multiple units (EMUs) into service on the Chennai-Tambaram-Chengalpet-Tirumalpur route. Trial runs of the 3-phase EMU rake are being conducted between Tambaram and Chengalpet. 

 After completion of the trial runs, the rake will be introduced for passenger services. The date of introduction will be notified soon, said a railway official. 
 
 Three-phase EMUs are energy-efficient and have a higher hauling capacity, meaning it can carry more passengers. The maximum speed of the EMUs will be 105kmph. 
 
 Energy conservation is higher in these EMUs as 30% of the power is regenerated during braking. THe EMUs will also have an event recorder to record operation and control systems. 
 
 The EMUs will have a public address system for private communication between crew and also for in-coach announcement. There will be an emergency stop button for emergency situations. 
 
 There will be surveillance cameras in ladies coaches to strengthen security for women passengers. In addition to fans, the coaches will also have an air ventilation system which will supply fresh air to the passenger area. The new 12-car rake comprises four units with solid state IGBT-based (insulated gate bipolar transistors) 3-phase propulsion drive system.
 
 R K Kulshrestha, general manager, Southern Railway, A K Kathpal, principal chief mechanical engineer, Naveen Gulati, divisional railway manager, Chennai, and other railway officials inspected the EMU car shed unit at Tambaram for commissioning of the new EMU suburban rail coach.
