PATNA: JD(U) MLA Vidya Sagar Nishad on Saturday received a threat SMS to quit politics and pay Rs 1 crore to the message sender. Nishad represents Morwa constituency in   district and he was at his village Chak Sikandar under Tajpur police station area. 

 “An unidentified criminal has threatened me to reach   in Jamui district with Rs1 crore or face the consequences,” Nishad said, adding that SP, Samastipur, has provided him security. 
 
 The MLA said he, on February 24, visited a bridge construction site over a river in his constituency where the criminals had exploded bombs to demand extortion on February 22 night.
 
 “I had expressed my concern to the SP over the increasing criminal activities after which I received the threat SMS,” he said, adding that the SMS might be a handiwork of his political rivals. Nishad said he had sent a written complaint to the Tajpur police station about the incident.
 
 However, SP (Samastipur) Naval Kishore Singh said police were yet to receive the MLA’s written complaint, but the police stations in Morwa constituency had been ordered to escort the MLA. “Efforts are on to nab the suspect after which the motive would be known, but the incident was unlikely to be related to the construction site explosion,” the SP said.
 
 Sources said a sub-inspector and three constables have been deployed for the MLA’s security.
