TRICHY: The city police seem to have learned a lot from the jallikattu protests, a key lesson being not to take social media invites calling for protests lightly. Political parties and pro-Tamil outfits have been going full steam with their protests and demonstrations in the past two days for the constitution of   ( ). Youths also have been contributing their mite to the campaign through social media platforms conveying their demands with memes and hashtags. 

 With invites pouring in to protest in support of farmers, police sources said that crucial spots have come under vigil. “Students and youths are eager to vent their frustration and emotional opinions in the   dispute, but it is unlikely to turn into a protest like jallikattu as it is not focused,” C Parthiban, a Trichy-based youth, said. While activists of political parties court arrest on the issue by staging road blockades and rail roko, tech-savvy youths storm social media platforms with videos, write-ups and memes to register their opinions. 
 
 “Some of the posts on Cauvery dispute available on social media platforms are logical and make the users ponder. It appears that some of the youths are keen to read the journey of Cauvery dispute thus far,” said another youth Z Shabeer Ahmed. With protest invites cropping up on social media platforms, particularly WhatsApp, police have mobilised their patrol in   link road which was the epicentre of jallikattu protest.
 
 “Ever since jallikattu protests took place for a week on Anna Nagar link road, we have been mobilising forces there to monitor movements whenever any statewide protest surfaced,” sources in the city police said.
