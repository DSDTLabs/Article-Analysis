VADODARA: The city may not have received rains over last two days but the overcast weather has kept   organizers on edge. 

 And, they are not leaving any stone unturned to ensure that rains don’t wash out  . Having spent big amounts on garba preparations and decorating the venue, the organizers have also decided to make provision for dealing with rains. 
 
  said that a team of 400 volunteers has been roped in to maintain the ground and drain out the water. “Our venue is at a cricket ground that has grass on it and also has slopes so that the water drains out. We have already purchased big quantities of saw dust and gravel to keep the venue dry in case it rains,” said Shivindersingh Chawla of United Way of Baroda.
 
 Organizers of Vadodara Navratri Festival (VNF) have gone a step ahead and purchased super soakers. “The   will gather all the water from the ground quickly. Also, we have prepared four water recharge wells in the centre of the venue. If it pours, the water will enter these wells and drains out. We have also done safety drills to evacuate people if it rains very heavily,” said Dilip Shah, chairman of VNF. 
 
 Many other garba venues have brought in plastic sheets to cover the venue during the day time. “We spent an additional amount of Rs 10 lakh last year to ensure that the garba doesn’t stop despite rains,” Chawla told TOI. The garba organizers are also wary as rains also cause losses to food-stall operators who pay high amounts to rent the stalls at garba venues.
