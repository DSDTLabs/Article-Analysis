LUCKNOW: Chief minister   on Thursday visited the trauma centre at KGMU to check on the student. 

 The father of the victim, however, claimed he was not allowed to meet the CM.
 
  There was high security hours before the CM was to arrive at the emergency facility. A number of patients and their attendants were stopped by security from entering the trauma centre. They were only allowed once the CM had left the premises. 
 
 "We have come from   with our 75-year-old father who has asthma and needs immediate support. But security stopped us for almost 30 minutes outside the trauma centre," said RD Dubey. 
 
 "Both the CM and state medical education minister   met the child. The CM spoke to the boy and he responded to him by telling his name and other small things. The child is stable but cannot be said to be out of danger as we are waiting to see if any internal injuries are present," said Prof  , head of trauma surgery department. 
 
 The boy is in the critical care unit of the trauma centre. Waiting outside the unit, his father   said, "I was not allowed to meet the CM. Security personnel stopped me even after I told them that I was the father and wanted to talk to the CM."
