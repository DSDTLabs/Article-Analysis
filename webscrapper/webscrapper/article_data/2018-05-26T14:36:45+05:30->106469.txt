NAGPUR: The Maoists, for the first time in many years, kept the security forces on their toes on Friday, when they had given a bandh call, by blocking roads, erecting banners, posters and distributing pamphlets at different places in   and   districts.

 With the bandh, the ‘resistance week’ of the Maoists held to protest the encounters of Gadchiroli and Ipenta also concluded. Though the Reds did not inflict any casualty in Maharashtra, they struck repeatedly by targeting the forest department.
 
 The bandh got maximum support in Korchi taluka where shops were shut and transport came to a standstill. The weekly markets at Mhaseli and   too were not held. The Maoists also felled around eight trees between Bhamragarh and Tadgaon to block the road. Several pamphlets of the Maoists too were found here.
 
 In   village in Bhamragarh taluka, a road-roller was set on fire. In Gondia, the Maoists put up banners at Rajaouli, Khedegaon and Purada villages.
 
  range DIG Ankush Shinde said the police have managed to free most of the roads. “The bandh did not have much impact,” he said.
 
 Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh said the bandh hit some stretches of Bhamragarh and Gatta. Tribals at some places like Kasnasur, Godalwahi and Chatgaon had protested against the bandh, he added.
