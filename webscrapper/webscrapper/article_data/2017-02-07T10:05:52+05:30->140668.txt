NAGPUR: Nitin Raut, ex-minister and former MLA of Nagpur North, has lodged a complaint with Ashok Chavan, president of   (MPCC), over distribution of double Congress B forms in his constituency. 

 The mess has created widespread unrest among Raut supporters, especially in north Nagpur. Irate workers are burning effigies of ex-MP Vilas Muttemwar and city Congress president Vikas Thakre.
 
 Raut told TOI that as a Congress leader it was his duty to inform the higher-ups about the mess. Chavan said that he had sought information about distribution of party B forms to more than one candidate in some seats. “An enquiry is going on,” he told TOI.
 
 While Raut did not elaborate on the complaint, his supporters charged that it was a deliberate attempt by some Congress leaders to sabotage the political career of the Dalit leader. 
 
 “If we lose a lot of seats in Nagpur North constituency due to this mess then Raut will have problem in contesting the next assembly elections. This is exactly what certain leaders in Congress want,” a close aide told TOI.
 
 Raut has stated in the complaint that double B forms were issued to candidates from five of the eight wards. From seat 2B, three candidates — Dinesh Yadav, Dilip Rode and   were given B forms. Sahina Ansari was finalized from 3D but the B form was also given Sunita Dhole, whose name was never discussed.
