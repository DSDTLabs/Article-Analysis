 During the last hearing, Oraon had asked the counsel of BJPs to produce six to seven witnesses during each hearing date, after the petitioners had raised the matter of deliberately delaying the hearing of the case.
 
 One Santosh Kumar who was produced as witness before the court deposed that he had attended a meeting of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) (JVM-P) in Daladali, Ranchi thinking that it was the general assembly of the party. The witness claimed that JVM-P had decided to merge with the BJP in the same meeting and that the joining of six MLAs should not be considered defection.
 
 However, petitioners, JVM-P president Babulal Marandi and the party's general secretary Pradeep Yadav claimed that the party never merged with BJP and the decision of the six MLAs was nothing but defection which calls for action under the tenth schedule of the constitution.
 
 R N Sahay, the petitioner advocate's counsel demanded restriction on witnesses of the deponents on grounds that they should have recorded their statement first. "Under provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure and Indian Penal Code, petitioner and deponents should record their statement before the witnesses are produced but in this case, the six MLAs in question have not deposed before the speaker's court, they should be debarred," Sahay said. 
 
 Oraon later fixed July 14 as the next date of hearing and asked the parties to cooperate in speedy disposal of the case.
 
 Meanwhile, the assembly secretariat notified new dates for monsoon session of the assembly from August 7.
