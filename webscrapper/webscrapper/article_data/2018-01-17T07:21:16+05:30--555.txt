Conveying funeral wishes to loved ones, drafting a will and discussing property division are some of the things which the   wants its citizens to do before they travel to Iraq, Iran, North Korea and other countries which have level four ratings. These suggestions are part of US government’s recently revised travel advisories.

 Last week, the department revamped its travel warning system and introduced colour code based rating of countries. The objective was to make it easy to understand for travellers. An online report says 80 million people travelled abroad in 2016 and the number is set to hit a new high in 2017.
 
 Apart from war-torn   and Iraq, North Korea and Iran, the US has included five states of Mexico in the list of “do not travel to” places. Other countries under the “level four” list are Mali, Central African Republic, Libya, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Afghanistan.
 
 In the advisory, those travelling to these countries have been asked to draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and a power of attorney. The third point on this list reads, “Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork), funeral wishes, etc.”
 
 It further says, “Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the US... Enrol in the Smart traveller enrolment programme to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.”
