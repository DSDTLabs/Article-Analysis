LUCKNOW: By retaining home along with 36 other  ,   Aditya Nath Yogi has sent a strong message that he would not succumb to any pressure, making it clear that there would be no   as has been the norm during   

 In fact, one of the two deputy CMs was reportedly mounting pressure on Yogi to give him the home department and the matter had escalated to the BJP high command in Delhi. However, Yogi put his foot down. Even till Wednesday morning, there was pressure on Yogi from some sections of the BJP but he refused to relent. By keeping the home portfolio with himself, he apparently wants to keep an eye on law and order directly from CM office.
 
 Another significant feature in the portfolio allocation has been that those loyal to Union minister for finance, Arun Jaitley have been given powerful departments. For example Siddharth Nath Singh has been given medical and health, Srikant Sharma energy and Satish Mahana industrial development.
 
 Deviating from past traditions, finance portfolio has been given to Rajesh Agarwal, who in the earlier BJP government held institutional finance. This is after a long time when a CM has not kept finance with himself.
