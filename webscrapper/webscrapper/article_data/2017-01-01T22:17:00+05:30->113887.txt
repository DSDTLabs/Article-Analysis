Mangaluru: Citing a   report that projected chief minister Siddaramaiah as the third most popular leader after B S Yeddyurappa and H D Kumaraswamy in Karnataka, veteran Congress leader B Janardhana   urged the CM to hand over the post to other eligible leaders in the party.

 Siddaramaiah was placed third with only 16% vote share, while BJP state president Yeddyurappa stood first with 46% votes and JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy bagged 38% vote share in a readership survey conducted by Vijay Karnataka, sister concern of TOI.
 
 “This (the survey) is the truth. I have been telling you that you are damaging the party in the state, but you are too reluctant to listen. Prediction is that you will face difficulty in Varuna constituency too. Why are you sticking on to power even after knowing the truth? I have suggested long back to make G Parameshwara, a dalit leader, the chief minister. There are many eligible leaders like Mallikarjun Kharge, S M Krishna, D K Shivakumar, S R Patil and others,” he said.
 
 Poojary also lashed out at Siddaramaiah for not stopping the Yettinahole project. “Union minister of state (independent charge) for environment, forest and climate change Anil Madhav Dave himself has spoken against the project. Dave has said that the ministry has not given nod to cut trees in the Western Ghats for Yettinahole project. Hence, CM should stop Yettinahole project and prepare a viable drinking water scheme for Kolar. This project will not only disfigure your political image, but also ruin the party, especially in coastal districts,” Poojary said adding that the CM has lost his sense.
