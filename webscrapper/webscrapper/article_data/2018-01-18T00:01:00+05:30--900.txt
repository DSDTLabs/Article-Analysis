Pimpri Chinchwad: Differences have cropped up in the Shiv Sena over the appointment of Yogesh Babar as president of Pimpri Chinchwad city unit. Babar took over from Rahul Kalate, who is Sena group leader in the PCMC, on Monday. 

 Son of former Sena corporator Madhukar Babar, Yogesh had contested the February 2017 civic election as an independent candidate from Sambhajinagar-Shahunagar-Morwadi ward after he was denied ticket by the party. Babar, who contested against Sena’s Pandurang Patil, was defeated by BJP’s Tushar Hinge.
 
 Sources said disgruntled party workers met in Pimpri on Tuesday night to oppose Babar’s appointment as he had rebelled against the party. They said a loyalist should have been given the post. Many workers threatened to quit but were pacified.
 
 Yogesh’s appointment to 
 
 check uncle’s influence? 
 
 Yogesh Babar is the son of former Sena corporator Madhukar Babar. His uncle, former Shiv Sena MP Gajanan Babar was a Sena MLA from Haveli Assembly constituency for two terms and a corporator for three terms. Gajanan Babar has a large number of followers in Mohannagar, Kalbhornagar and other areas in Chinchwad and Akurdi. Therefore, it is being believed that Yogesh’s appointment was made to reduce his uncle’s influence.
