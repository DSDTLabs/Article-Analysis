PATNA: Rebel   MP   on Thursday launched a scathing attack on senior party functionary and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, holding him responsible for the party’s defeat in the 2015 assembly elections.

 In a series of tweets, the Patna Sahib MP called the deputy CM the real “shatru” of BJP. “He has the audacity to suggest that BJP’s Shatru should follow his mentor   – meaning that Shatru should leave the party. Of course we all know that he himself is the biggest enemy of BJP since he was responsible for our huge defeat in Bihar,” Shotgun tweeted.
 
 Former Union minister and a member of BJP’s ‘margdarshak mandal’, Yashwant Sinha, had announced his decision to quit the party and “retire” from electoral politics at a meeting of the recently launched ‘Rashtra Manch’ in Patna on April 21. Shatrughan was also present at the meeting.
 
 In another tweet addressed to PM Narendra Modi, Shatrughan said the Bihar deputy CM was solely responsible for BJP’s defeat in the last state assembly elections. He went on to say that the deputy CM’s favourite pastime is criticising   and his family members.
 
 Shatrughan had left his party red-faced on several occasions in the recent past. His meeting with Bengal CM and   chief Mamata Banerjee in New Delhi on March 28 and repeated praises of Lalu’s son   had not gone down well with BJP.
 
  was not available for a comment on Shatrughan’s tweets.
