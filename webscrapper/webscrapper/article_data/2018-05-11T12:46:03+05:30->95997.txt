BHOPAL: Hearing in Bhopal gas disaster criminal case was deferred on Thursday as district & session judge, who is seized of the matter, was on leave. The hearing would now resume on Friday.

 
 All the six accused in the case, who were awarded two years of rigorous imprisonment by the trial court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) in 2010, have gone in appeal against the sentence in session court, thereby necessitating fresh court proceedings. In the previous hearing, the court had rejected application of  , counsel for two of the accused in the case, for seeking   case diary for his clients.
 
 Roy, counsel for Jai Mukund and S P Chaudhary, had
 
 argued at length that CBI had not been fair in investigation and its chargesheet was inspired by report of scientific team led by   rather than its own independent investigation.
 
 He had also charged the CBI with omitting crucial facts in the case and not examining witnesses, who knew the truth about the disaster and how it happened. He had urged the court to order CBI to provide a copy of case diary to his clients so that lacunae in its investigation could be exposed, but the judge   was not convinced.
 
 Roy, while talking to 
  from Mumbai, said that they have now filed a revision petition against Bhopal district judge declining their request for CBI case diary and they would urge the court on Friday to suspend hearing of the case till the high court decides their application for case diary.
