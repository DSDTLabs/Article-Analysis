NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Monday asked the AAP government and the three corporations why they have not implemented the 7th   for school staff and teachers.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar also wondered how private unaided schools in Delhi would implement the 7th Pay Commission recommendations without government allowing hiking their fees.
 
 The court asked the government to answer its query on   and implementation of the pay panel recommendations and to file a status report on the issue.
 
 HC stressed that the government would have to monitor the implementation of the recommendations and not wait for teachers’ complaints to take any action. “Why should you wait for complaints? You have to monitor the implementation of your order. Here you cannot take excuse that the central government is not giving you funds,” the bench said and directed the government to file a status report in eight weeks.
 
 HC’s response came when the government told the bench it had already issued an order in August 2017 asking all private unaided schools to implement the recommendations.
 
 The court, which listed the matter for further hearing on September 25, was hearing a PIL by  ,  , through advocate Ashok Agarwal seeking directions to the government and corporations to ensure implementation of the recommendations regarding the teaching and non-teaching staff of the private unaided schools. The petition also sought appropriate action against the erring private schools, even as it has remained opposed to fee hike.
