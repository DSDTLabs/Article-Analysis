PUNE: Almost a week has passed since the   of seven families in   came to the fore, but the perpetrators continue to roam free.

 There’s no end to atrocities by traditional   across the state as the Maharashtra Protection of People from Social Boycott (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2016 awaits the President’s nod.
 
 After the law was passed exactly a year ago, Maharashtra became the first state in the country to have a statute making social boycott a crime. Activists are, however, unhappy with the Centre for not speeding up the process to get the final nod for the law.
 
 “The state government approved the law on April 14 last year with continuous follow up by the   (MANS). But it is still pending with the central government. As hundreds of families continue to suffer because of caste laws, the bill must be approved immediately” said Hamid Dabholkar of MANS.
 
 Anyone found guilty of imposing social boycott on an individual or group of individuals can be imprisoned up to three years and fined Rs 1 lakh under the Act. The fine (in whole or part) will be paid as compensation to the victim. The offence is cognizable and bailable as per the statute.
 
 “The government must not delay in approving the Act, as atrocities in the name of jat panchayat continues in both the urban and rural parts of the state. Stringent steps are needed to stop cases. These castes have their own constitution, and it is high time that they followed the Indian Constitution,” said activist Maruti Joshi. 
 
  Youths of Baudhwada at   village in Chiplun taluka had decided to oppose some traditions based on superstition. They also opposed the parallel justice system run by the caste members. Some of these youths work in Mumbai and Pune and told the villagers that they need to shed old traditions that hamper the development of community. Subsequently, the senior community members heading the parallel judiciary system ordered boycott of their families.
