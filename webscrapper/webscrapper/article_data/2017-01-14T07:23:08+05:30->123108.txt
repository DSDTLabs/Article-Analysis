CHARMINAR: Hundreds of women eking out a living by selling hand-made   have now been rendered jobless due to new   flooding the market.

 Once hand-made agarbattis were in great demand across the  , but now wholesale dealers prefer machine-made ones from Bengaluru as they are a lot cheaper.
 
 “I prefer machine-made ones rather than hand-made agarbattis as it keeps my costs down. But, yes, it has rendered many people jobless,'' wholesale dealer Hasanuddin Khan said.
 
 Consequently , local manufacturers, who mostly employed women, have now sacked around 80%. Most of them have either reduced the out put or even downed shutters. “We have no option but to close down as we are running into losses,“ said Mohd Abdul Qadeer, one of the leading agarbatti manufacturers. And agarbatti workers are a worried lot.
 
 “I used to make 15-20kg everyday and earned Rs 300-400 each day . It was good for me as I used to help my husband. Ever since the factory closed down, I have become jobless. I don't know how I will earn a living now,'' said Razia Begum. Five years ago, there were about 30 factories manufacturing 15 quintals of agarbatti a day. This has now reduced to only 10 across the city.
 
 Now, all the agarbattis come from Bengaluru, which are cheaper and better. “The new ones seem to last longer, but the local ones definitely used to smell better,“ said Nazia Begum, a local resident.
