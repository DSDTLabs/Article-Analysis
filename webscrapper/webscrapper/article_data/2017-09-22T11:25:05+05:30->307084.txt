JAIPUR: Following reports that  , wanted by   police for inciting violence after Dera Sacha Sauda chief   Ram Rahim Singh’s conviction in rape cases, was hiding in his   situated house, a team of   police along with the local police raided the place in Gurusar Modiya. However, the 4 hour long raids remained unfruitful.

 The village witnessed frenzied activity from 12.30pm to 4.30pm on Thursday, as police teams raided Gurmeet’s house, a school and other nearby places in Hanumangarh and Sriganganagar districts of Rajasthan. 
 
 Honeypreet, the “adopted daughter” of Gurmeet, has been booked in Haryana for allegedly inciting violence following his conviction in rape cases. The Haryana police have already brought out a look out notice against her. There were unconfirmed reports that Honeypreet had visited Hanumangarh a day after Gurmeet’s conviction on August 28. 
 
 Honeypreet has been absconding since Gurmeet’s sentencing. She has been charged with sedition for allegedly plotting the self-appointed preacher’s escape from a court in Panchkula where he was held guilty. 
 
 “The Haryana police came for their investigation. They did not share much about their operation. We provided our men and vehicles for their help,” said Yadram Phansal, Superintendent of police, Hanumangarh. He added that Haryana police had searched various places at the sect followers and also visited the school run by jailed Dera chief.
