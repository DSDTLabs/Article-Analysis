BENGALURU: India's non-playing captain   left the door open for his former partner  , with the seasoned pro joining the   squad for the clash against  .

 Paes, who along with fellow doubles star   is one of two reserve players in the reckoning following  's pullout of the   I second round match, landed in the city late on Tuesday after winning the Leon Challenger in Mexico last week.
 
 “It's not ideal, that's for sure,“ Bhupathi told reporters on Tuesday when quizzed about preparations without Paes for the first three days, suggesting that the 43-year-old was still in consideration. The fact that Bopanna wasn't part of the official press conference meant no spots were guaranteed.
 
 “The conditions here are fast and we have big servers on our team,“ Bhupathi said, explaining the factors he would consider before picking his man. “We need to make the best of the conditions and the practice. We have to consider the opposition and camaraderie. Once we put all those together, the team will come together.“
 
 Bhupathi, however, stressed that doubles was just one point out of a possible five and backed youngsters Ramkumar Ramanathan, N Sriram Balaji and Prajnesh Gunneswaran to deliver against the visitors.“The focus needs to be on how we are going to win three points. There's a lot of talk about doubles which has been going on for weeks and it'll probably go on for the next 48 hours. Our focus is to go out there and win three points.“
 
 Bhupathi said one of his goals was to get the team to believe it can return to the World Group. “We have a young group with the ability to play on multiple surfaces. All three boys sitting have the ability to serve at 130mph, which in today's power tennis is a big advantage. It's about creating a good team atmosphere and constantly working on a squad of six so we can pick players depending on the surface and opposition.“
