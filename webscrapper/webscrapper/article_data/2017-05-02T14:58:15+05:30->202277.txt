 Similarly, its overall market share in the state has also improved from 7.66% in 2015-16 to 8.80% in 2016-17. But Arya said the market share in the mobile segment has grown by 30.5%.
 
 “BSNL had a market share of 7.85% in 2015-16 in the state in mobile segment. In 2016-17, the share has increased to 10.24%. One of the main reasons for this improved performance is that we have been able to strengthen our existing tower and exchange network by increasing their efficiency, while adding new towers. Sometimes, the existing network does not get the same priority as putting up new towers. But we have tried to address that weakness last year,” added Arya.
 
 In terms of new mobile connections, the Rajasthan circle has also registered a growth of 95%. In 2015-16, BSNL’s Rajasthan circle had issued 9.53 lakh connection but the number increased to 18.46 lakh in 2016-17, said Arya.
