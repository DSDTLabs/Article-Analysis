BHUBANESWAR: Being a  , Odisha is likely to mop up more revenue from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as against the manufacturing states, experts said on the day the Naveen Patnaik government cleared the bill in a special assembly session. 

 "GST being a   and being   where it is used (rather than produced), the   on the   will ordinarily go to the consuming state. This should benefit Odisha," said Padmaja Mishra, a professor of economics.
 
 "Apart from revenue for the state, the end consumers in poorer states such as Odisha stand to gain because rice, dal, milk are going to become cheaper. Prices of wheat and rice will reduce as they will be exempt from GST," she added.
 
 Finance minister Shasibhusan Behera said the new tax regime is going to benefit each Indian, making life simpler for everyone. 
 
 "The creation of tariff and non-tariff barriers such as octroi and entry tax hindered free flow of goods throughout the country. Huge quantities of goods get destroyed because these are held up for checking various taxations enroute. If that is removed, the whole of India will benefit," Behera said.
 
 He said the government is examining the impact of the new tax regime on the prices of individual items.
 
 Leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra, however, said more analysis needs to be done to conclude whether the new tax regime will benefit the state and the poor people. 
 
 "The GST has no clarity on the farm sector and its likely impact on farmers. While passing the SGST Bill, the state government is groping in the dark," he claimed.
 
 The finance minister, however, clarified that farmers, including share-croppers, will be kept outside the GST purview.
