Indian boxing’s poster boy,   is in news again because his scheduled opponent and Chinese boxer   has wriggled out of the contest that was supposed to take place in Mumbai in April. Interestingly, Zulpikar hasn’t cited any reason for backing out of this much-awaited bout. Vijender spoke about this changed scenario in a telephonic chat…

 
 
 I don’t know why Zulpikar backed out. But my team tells me that it is due to some technical reasons that he has refused to fight with me in April. But as a sportsperson, it would be incorrect to claim that he got wary of me because of my past eight fights. I still have a long way to go! I won’t allow myself to think that I’m a superstar and I’m undefeatable. In sports, you either win a fight or learn something. My job is to fight, and on April 1, I will sure fight another boxer and enjoy my game to the fullest.
 
 
 
 He’s Chinese, so I don’t think we would understand each other. But hypothetically, if we were to speak, I would say — ‘We will fight soon.’ I’m sure this fight will take place later this year or maybe next year. So, no hard feelings at all. For now, I’m focussed on my training.
 
 
 Of course yes, given half a chance, I would love to fight with Mike Tyson. It will be a dream come true. If I win, it would be amazing, and if I lose, it would definitely be the best learning experience of my life. So, it would be a win-win situation for sure.
