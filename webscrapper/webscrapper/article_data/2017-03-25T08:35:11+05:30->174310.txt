 “This time of the year is usually considered to be the pre-monsoon season. But this week there has been no activity which could have disseminated rain-bearing clouds over the state. This is why temperatures have risen to such an extent,“ Mahesh Palawat, chief meteo rologist, Skymet, said.
 
 Till March 19, there were successive disturbances in the western coast which brought rain over central and southern parts of the country , but there has been a lull in such activity now, he said.
 
 Dr  , director general, IMD told TOI, “It is not just meteorological reasons that contribute to such a rise in the temperature. Since the local land-use pattern in Hyderabad has also changed the city has fallen prey to the Urban Heat Island effect.“ Urban Heat Island effect causes a city to be warmer than its rural surroundings, owing to the rapid urbanization there.
 
 Adilabad was the hottest on Friday with a temperature of 40.5 degrees Celsius.
