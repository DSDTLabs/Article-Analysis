KOLHAPUR: Citizens welcomed the state government’s decision to appoint priests at the Mahalaxmi temple by distributing sweets at Dasara chowk on Thursday. The members agitating for the removal of the existing priests were at the forefront of the celebrations including city mayor  .

 The state assembly unanimously passed a law abolishing the hereditary appointment of priests in Mahalaxmi temple on Wednesday. The government will soon constitute an eight-member committee which will look after the daily affairs of the temple and have the authority to spend the donations made to the goddess.
 
 “We are happy that the state government has accepted our demand to remove existing priests and appoint priests on the lines of Pandharpur temple. We have been agitating for a very long time and forwarded our demand to chief minister  . Now that the government has unanimously passed the law, we expect that it will soon act on this issue. Now, it is our duty to ensure that once the new structure comes into effect, it functions in the interest of the devotees and the betterment of the temple administration,” said an activist who was at the forefront of the demand for the removal of hereditary priests. 
 
 The agitation against existing priests had begun after priest   draped   in a ‘ghagara-choli’ instead of the traditional attire on June 9, 2017. A case was registered against Thanekar and two others at the   police station. Following this incident, activists had fought tooth and nail demanding the removal of the existing priests and appointing new priests on the lines of Pandharpur temple.
