SURAT: City police are likely to revoke the ban they imposed on four-wheelers on   a week ago from January 5 in view of massive objections received from different quarters of society. 

 The ban on four-wheelers and their parking between 10am and 12 noon, and from 5 to 7pm was notified by city police commissioner Satish Sharma. The ban was opposed by residents of the areas around Raj Marg as their by-lanes were being used by four-wheeler drivers for movement and parking of the vehicles. 
 
 Darshana Jardosh, BJP MP from Surat, was among the first few people to register her objection. The ban on cars was impacting adversely the movement of school vans too. 
 
 Police have considered the appeal made by political leaders and local people on the ban, sources said, adding that they are mulling other options to reduce   congestion on Raj Marg.
 
 Police commissioner Satish Sharma said, “We are reconsidering our decision to ban cars while movement of auto-rickshaws will be restricted. The new notification will be issued soon.”
