DEHRADUN: The Dr  , which got the permission to open   in Dehradun by the   mandated   (OC) on MCI, has hit a roadblock after an inspection team of the   in its report gave a thumbs down to the project.
 
  The MCI report, a copy of which is available with TOI, reads as: “The Trust does not meet with the qualifying criteria of establishment of a new medical college.”
  
  According to the report, the trust possesses 13.59 acres in three revenue villages, whereas the minimum requirement as per the MCI regulation is 20 acres, which could be in two pieces not more than 10 km apart. Besides, one piece should be minimum five acres due to which the medical college has run into thick soup.
  
  The college administration has, however, stated that it is not in receipt of any communication either from the OC or the MCI.
  
  “We have not received any communication from OC/MCI, hence, we are not in a position to make any comment. There is no deficiency in the medical college; and, if any has been pointed out by the MCI, we will get that rectified.” said Dr Atul Krishan, advisor to the medical university.
