NAGPUR: The principal chief conservator of forests ( ) for wildlife on Friday finally granted permission to capture and treat the injured tiger at  .

 The order was issued following recommendation by the committee headed by Nagpur deputy conservator of forests (DyCF)   on Thursday. The panel was constituted as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s ( ) standard operating procedure (SOP).
 
 Earlier, sources said NTCA officials were opposed to capture the tiger and against putting baits considering it must be old. The norms prohibit a free ranging animal to be lifted for treatment.
 
 But after examination, it was found that the tiger is young, may be three years old, and has potential to be re-released. On Thursday, the committee decided to seek permission from PCCF to capture the tiger to examine it.
 
 The tiger was first traced in Mogarkasa forest in compartment no. 440 in   range on May 8. It has swelling in front right leg and hence, its movement is sluggish. It’s is moving in the same area. The tiger, sighted at the backyard of Mogarkasa rest house on May 9, moved a few metres and sat down. His condition is deteriorating as it is unable to hunt.
 
 According to sarpanch Ramkrishna Warkhade and police patil  , both members of the committee, said there are 5-6 villages in the vicinity where the tiger has been located. “There is every possibility that the hungry animal may attack livestock in these villages. The injured animal also poses threat to villagers engaged in tendu patta collection” they said.
