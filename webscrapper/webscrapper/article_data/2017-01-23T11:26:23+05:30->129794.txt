Handsome   is not only a superb actor but also a doting father.
 
  Arjun's son Ayaan is the apple of his eye and the actor just cannot be with him. Arjun's Instagram is a proof as his account is full of his little munchkin's photos.
  
  As Ayaan turned a year older recently, daddy Arjun posted an adorable collage of their happy family wishing his son.
  
  
 
  
  Arjun also posted a picture of his childhood and compared it with Ayaan. Well, must say that daddy and son are a carbon copy of each other.
  
  
  
  
  He captioned it saying "Spot the difference..this picture sums it alll .#LIFE #happiness #LOVE#nocaption#time ðŸ™‡ðŸ™‡"
  
  The two look exactly the same and now we know, where Ayaan has got his good looks from.
