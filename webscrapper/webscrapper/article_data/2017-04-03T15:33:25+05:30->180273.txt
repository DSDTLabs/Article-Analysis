 actress   said her daughter   is too young to decide whether she wants to follow the footsteps of her parents and become an actor. 

 Kajol said that her 13-year-old daughter is going through a phase of 'no homework' and is not really thinking about anything else. "She has no aspirations towards anything right now because she is too young. She is right now leaning towards no homework and vegetating on the sofa. She is in that space and enjoying and acting isn't on her mind," Kajol said. 
 
 Kajol, who also has a six-year-old son Yug with actor husband 
 , said though she loves being a mother, it is easier being an   than a parent as it is a full time job which requires absolute dedication.
 
  
  
 "It is easier being an actress than a mother. It is difficult (being a mother) because it is a full time job, you have to be mentally aware, be 100 percent there with your children at every moment. You learn new things from your kids everyday even in the process of teaching them," she said. 
 
 The 42-year-old actress said, when the kids are growing up, the attitude of parents has to change towards their them and should have faith in the upbringing. "Over the years the kids don't change so much as your attitude towards them has to change. You have to start believing in your upbringing after a point. You have to believe you've done a good job so far, start trusting them to make the right decision." 
 
 As a kid, however, Kajol said she never was star-struck or shy because she comes from film family herself. "May be because I came from a film family, I was never nervous, shy or blushed in front of celebrities. That's my personality. I was pretty much okay with most people. I never had the sense of being star struck."
