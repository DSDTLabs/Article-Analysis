Mhow: Life of a 28-year-old   was put at risk when Mhow Red Cross Hospital’s staff allegedly refused to admit her. 

 The woman, Jyoti, had labour pains on Wednesday and her husband, Shiv Mishra, took her to   from Pithampur. But she was denied and admission. From there she was taken to a private hospital, where she delivered the baby just five minutes after arrival. 
 
 Shiv, who hails from Rewa district, said “I took my wife to Mhow since there was less facilities in Pithampur. But, Red Cross Hospital administration took an arbitrary decision and refused to admit my wife when she was in labour pains.”
 
 Red Cross Hospital administrator  , 80, said that Jyoti was taking treatment from Dr Rashmi Chauhan and he was directed by his superiors to allow Dr Chauhan for any type of work in the hospital. “I could have not refused to admit the woman had I aware about her condition,” said Sharma.
 
 Mhow SDM Pratul Sinha, who is ex-officio chairman of the hospital, said that he will order an inquiry in the case and if any person would be found responsible for any discrepancy, an action will be taken against him.
 
 As per eyewitnesses, a delay of even five minutes in reaching the private hospital could have proved fatal for both woman and her child.
