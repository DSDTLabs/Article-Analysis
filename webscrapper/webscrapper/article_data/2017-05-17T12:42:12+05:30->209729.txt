CHENNAI: A three-star hotel was sealed in the bustling T Nagar by the   (CMDA) for violating building rules on Friday. The planning permission was obtained for a residential building but was subsequently converted into a commercial establishment. Guests of the hotel, majority of them tourists from Malaysia, were shifted. 

 Sources in the CMDA said that the action was taken against M Grand at   after a court order. 
 
 "The building was functioning as a lodging facility without adequate setback area to operate as a commercial establishment. It should have a setback area of six metres on four sides of building, but the space is absent in one side of the building," a CMDA official said.
 
 An official alleged that the building also has an additional floor exceeding the permitted three floors. The property owners went on an appeal before a court against a lock and seal notice but the order came in favour of the planning authority. "The hotel authorities had appealed to the government also seeking reprieve. Three months time was granted to carry out modifications," the official said. However, no action was taken by the hotel authorities. 
 
 Meanwhile, the guest in the hotel were shifted to other accommodations before the building was sealed. A police source, who was present during to the lock and seal procedure, said a majority of guest who were staying in the hotel were from Malaysia.
