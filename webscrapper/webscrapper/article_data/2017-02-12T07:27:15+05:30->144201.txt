CHENNAI: With more senior leaders breaking away to join Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam's camp,   general secretary V K Sasikala on Saturday rushed to the   at Koovathur near Mamallapuram to hold talks with the MLAs staying there.

 Sasikala, accompanied by partymen and supporters in several cars and SUVs, reached Koovathur around 4pm. Reporters, who were waiting around 2km from the resort, ran behind her vehicle in an effort to reach her. However, police blocked them.
 
 Villagers, who had registered a strong protest against the presence of outsiders in their otherwise peaceful hamlet, gathered in large numbers and raised slogans against police. They also appealed to the MLAs to support OPS. “Podungama vottu OPS pathu“ (cast your vote looking at OPS) slogans reverberated in the air.
 
 Several senior AIADMK leaders, including former MLAs and office-bearers, have joined hands with Panneerselvam, triggering panic in the Sasikala camp. Sources said the AIADMK general secretary sensed that as time passed, more and more ministers, legislators, MPs and party functionaries could shift to the Panneerselvam camp and she decided to speak to the MLAs in person in an effort to stem the flow.
 
 Sources said not all the 94 MLAs staying in the resort had given written declarations that they had been staying there voluntarily. More than half of them reportedly refused to give any declaration. This too caused panic in the Sasikala camp.
 
 Sources added that when all of Sasikala's attempts to convince them via video conference failed, she decided to meet them in person and rushed to the resort.
