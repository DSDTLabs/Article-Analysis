Picture this. One day, you wake up and find yourself robbed of all your clothes. Frustratingly hilarious, isn’t it? Well that’s what happens in the play  ? that was staged in   this Sunday. The adaptation of   and John Antrobus’ side-splitting West End hit by the   had the audience rolling in the aisles without a break. The farce begins when Sundeep ‘Sunny’ Kumar’s extra-marital escapade turns into a nightmare for him when a burglar breaks into his mistress’ apartment and steals all his clothes. The chaos gets worse when a constable barges into the apartment looking for a bomb. Replete with witty lines, hysterical plot and commendable acting, this play was an out and out laugh riot.
