RAJKOT: In a tragic incident, a three-year-old boy died after being   in a funfair being held at   on Friday night. 

 
 Victim Jay Gujarati had gone with his parents to the fair and was moving around freely. All of a sudden, he went to see the toy train out of curiosity. However, he went close to the tracks when the train was approaching and got stuck. His head got crushed under the train. Commotion broke out and his family rushed there and started screaming for help. He was immediately taken to the civil hospital, but the doctors declared him dead on admission. 
 
 A first information report (FIR) was lodged against operator/owner of the toy train at A-division police station under Section 304 (A) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and Section 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery).
 
 They are yet to record the statement of Jay's family, who is in a deep shock and not in the condition to even talk due to the trauma. His father   had to be given   in the morning as his mental condition showed signs of worsening. Vijay is engaged in the business of used cars. Jay also has two elder sisters.
 
 Investigation officer   said, "We have found negligence on the part of fair organizers as there was no railing to prevent people to get close to the moving train. There was no gatekeeper, too, near the tracks."
 
 Police have also got the closed circuit television footages of the accident, which shows the child going near the moving train while playing. The footage also shows there is no person to prevent people, especially children, to go close to the train.
