KOLKATA: A couple of days after chief minister   expressed her concerns in Bengal assembly over the loss of young lives due to bike racing, the state formed a committee to look for legal options to rein in  . 

 The CM asked for stringent legal provisions against rash and negligent driving. 
 
 “This requires amendment of the Central Motor Vehicles Rule (CMVR), which is governed by the Union ministry of road transport and highways,” she said.
 
 On Monday, state transport minister Suvendu Adhikari said, “It is right that amendment of rules is in the hands of the central government. But after our CM’s concern, we want to explore every possibility to bring about strong legal options so that rash and negligent driving is stopped. We have formed a committee headed by principal secretary (transport) Alapan Bandyopadhyay to explore legal options.” The law secretary and representative of directorate of police will also be part of the committee.
 
 Adhikari added that the government has also intensified checking against over-loading. There are six check-posts which regularly check vehicles carrying loads more than they are supposed to. Such overloading damages roads and increases the accident-proneness of the vehicle.
