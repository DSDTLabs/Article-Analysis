MUMBAI:   commuters will soon be able to get   updates on the arrival of suburban trains at stations on a mobile application.   has the system since 2014; commuters can see a train’s status on the National Train Enquiry System (NTES) app or website.

 WR’s divisional railway manager ( ) Mukul Jain said, “We are working on it, to integrate the train management system (TMS), so that information displayed on platform indicators gets reflected on the app and NTES website.”
 
 WR runs 1,322 services on its suburban system; each train route will have to be integrated with the system, besides feeding of inter-station timing. Once done, commuters can visit the website or app and click on ‘Live station’ to get the expected arrival time of trains scheduled to depart in two to four hours. For example, on selecting Borivli, commuters will get the arrival status of trains heading to Churchgate and Virar as against the departure time.
 
 “Real-time tracking of trains is only available for long-distance trains on WR now. Jain said, “Apart from NTES, real-time updates can be accessed on WR’s DISHA app.” The app will provide information about the location and availability of amenities at WR stations. It will also give information on the railway station, nearby places, toilets, hospitals and police station nearby.
 
 A WR official said, “The application is needed as people can check a train’s status before go to the station.” 
 
 Kandivli commuter Harish Shah said, “It will be handy, particularly when services are disrupted. If we get real-time updates, we can decide whether to travel by train, road, or cancel the journey.”
 
 CR commuters have found the NTES app extremely useful. Dombivli resident   said, “On CR, punctuality is a major issue, hence I prefer the app before leaving from office at  . I can postpone my journey if the app shows trains are running 15-20 minutes late.”
