KOLKATA: After the lull for the past few days, the city might get some spells of rain. The Met office spies rain activity on both Monday and Tuesday. A cyclonic circulation over the   has already started infusing much moisture pushing up cloud formation.

 “A cyclonic circulation that was positioned above   now has moved over to the north central bay. We are already experiencing moisture incursion activities, which in turn is pushing up cloud formation," said GK Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata.
 
 According to meteorologists, whenever a cyclonic circulation forms over the North Bay, the city gets rain activity. Currently, there is also steady flow of easterly wind that makes the chances of rain brighter. 
 
 The shower spells accompanied thunder and lightning will also drag the mercury down slightly making it more tolerable for thousands who are out shopping for the festival. With puja organizers working on last minute details on the pandals, the impending rain would be unwanted. Met office, however, assures that Puja committees need not worry as the rain will not be heavy enough to affect the pandals.
 
 “It will be light rain and the amount will not be able to dampen the festival spirit, spoil pandals or cause water logging. In fact it will make work as soother when many are complaining of heat and humidity,” said a meteorologist.
