LUCKNOW: A day after BSP supremo   hinted that she was prepared to ally with any party to fight the  , SP chief   Yadav reciprocated on Saturday saying he was ready for an   against the “propaganda of the saffron brigade”.

  On Saturday, replying to a query from reporters on Mayawati’s readiness for an alliance, Akhilesh said: “Jis tarah se jhoot phailaya ja raha hai … dhokhe se sarkar bana li …koi na koi raasta nikalnachahiye, chahe woh gathbandhan ho (The manner in which BJP has formed the government through deceit using false propaganda, it has to be countered... even if it means having an alliance).” Addressing BSP workers on Friday, Mayawati had said: “Zehar ko zehar se marenge (We will counter poison with poison).”
 
 Akhilesh said he had met a host of senior leaders of opposition parties for an anti-BJP alliance and held “positive discussions” in this regard.
 
 He said he had talked about the need for unity of all the secular forces in UP just a few days before the election results were announced last month and was ready to discuss it now as well. “In case of a gathbandhan (alliance), SP will play a role with all responsibility,” he said.
 
 Attacking the Yogi government for ordering probe into two flagship projects of his regime, Gomti River Front and Janeshwar Misra Park, Akhilesh said: “It is good that inquiries have been ordered. This way at least the BJP government will come to know that these projects are actually meant for the people. I am told that even RSS holds its shakhas at Janeshwar Misra Park.”
