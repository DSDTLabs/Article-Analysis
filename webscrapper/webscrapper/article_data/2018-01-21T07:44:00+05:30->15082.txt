She started teaching later and was serving as principal in Swami Vivekanand School for the past six years.
 
 It was a normal morning for the Khera family till they received a call from Yamunanagar that Ritu had been shot and sustained three bullet injuries. The shocked family, including her father, mother and brother left for Yamunananagar immediately. On the way they received another call that Ritu had succumbed to the injuries in a hospital.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Ritu’s brother Rohish Khera said, “She was here with her family to celebrate Lohri festival last week. We never knew that this would be our last celebration together. In fact last night, we spoke over phone. It was just a normal phone call and we talked for a while. That was her last call. I could not believe she has been killed so brutally by her student. She wanted to make her career in teaching but we never knew this profession would take her life. I want justice for my sister,” he said.
 
 By Saturday evening, entire Khera family and some relatives left for Yamunanagar. Ritu is survived by her husband and two college-going sons.
