NEW DELHI: Newly formed political outfit   on Tuesday moved the Delhi high court challenging latest rules of the state election commission that deny a common symbol to a new party.

 Blaming the ruling   for an “underhand attempt” to deny   candidates a common poll symbol, the party has assailed state election commission’s failure to provide it a common symbol for the upcoming municipal polls in the city.
 
 Appearing for the party, senior advocate Arvind Nigam mentioned the matter before a bench of Justices   and V K Rao for an urgent hearing, after which the court allowed the case to be listed on Wednesday before a court.
 
 “While by the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) (Amendment) Order, 2013 dated 10th July 2013, the   itself allows newly registered political parties to have a common symbol for all their candidates for contesting their first election and States like Maharashtra,  , Haryana,  , Kerala, Sikkim and Tripura follow the rule made by ECI, in a bizarre reversal of the rule and departure from all democratic norms, precedents and logic, the   government has notified the Delhi Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 2016 dated 5th April 2016 of the Delhi Election Commission, specifically barring candidates of new parties from having a common symbol,” said Anupam, spokesperson for the party.
 
 In its plea, the party has argued that the poll panel denied their request for a symbol on March 7 despite a provision in the rules to provide a symbol to a registered but unrecognised political party such as Swaraj India, which is set to make its election debut in the upcoming municipal polls.
 
 Swaraj India said having a common symbol creates a level playing field for a fair contest between all parties and pointed out that when AAP was a newly registered party, “it was one of the first to benefit from the Order dated 10th July 2013 of ECI when the then newly registered AAP was allowed to have the common symbol of Jhadu for its candidates in the 2014 Assembly polls.”
