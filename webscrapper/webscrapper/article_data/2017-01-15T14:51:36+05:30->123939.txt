MUMBAI: Ruling ally   (A) wants to contest on 29 seats in the upcoming   polls and has also sought  's post, if BJP and Shiv Sena seal an alliance and come to power in the civic body.

 "If BJP and Shiv Sena are forming an alliance for BMC elections, then my party would like to have a share of 29 seats. We can easily win these seats and share power. We will also like to have post of deputy mayor as well as chairman of standing committee for at least one year," RPI(A) leader and Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale said on Sunday.
 
 There is uncertainty over whether BJP and Shiv Sena will contest together the polls to the cash-rich BMC.
 
 "If Shiv Sena and BJP contest elections separately, it will be division of votes. If both the parties contest election jointly and RPI (A) supporting them; then our alliance can win some BMC seats, which were traditionally won by the opponents. Hence, there should be a practical approach before breaking the alliance," Athawale said.
 
 He also said that if the alliance does not take place, then his party will support BJP.
 
 "If the alliance did not work out, then RPI(A) would like to have at least 50 seats, so that RPI (A) and BJP can jointly win more seats," the Rajya Sabha member said.
