TUTICORIN: The smelter in   based Sterlite’s copper unit will be closed for 15 days due to maintenance work. Officials in the plant maintained that this was in no way connected to the protests undertaken by villagers against the plant and the partial closure was part of their routine maintenance work. Closure of the smelter from Monday resulted in spreading of rumours that it was due to the 24-hour closure of shops and public meeting that attracted around 15,000 people on Sunday.

 An official in the plant said that the smelter was closed for 15 days on a four-year cycle for carrying out the replacement of the brick lines in the furnace. “Date for the works is fixed on completion of the previous replacement four years ago. On completion of the smelter works this time the date for the next such work will be fixed. While it usually takes 15 days, it could be completed one or two days ahead or beyond the scheduled date,” he said.
 
 However, temporary closure of the smelter is said to not have affected copper production as the refining and copper rod production is under way as usual. The official also denied that the closure of the smelter was due to a technical snag. The company maintained that people with vested interests were making false claims that their plant was polluting the environment and that the company would soon come out with answers to the allegations.
 
 Meanwhile, on Thursday the   demanding closure of Sterlite continued for the 47th day at   village. Children too participated in the protest and raised slogans against the plant alleging that it was polluting the environment badly.   representatives who extended their support to the villagers said that their party chief and former   minister   would soon meet the villagers.
