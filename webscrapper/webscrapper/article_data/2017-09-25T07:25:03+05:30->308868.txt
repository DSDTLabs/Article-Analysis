CHANDIGARH: Haryana police have registered a case of gang rape and harassment against two employees of a private school in Sonipat district after the survivor sent an anonymous email to the Prime Minister's Office appealing for justice.

 In her email, the survivor, a minor, has alleged that she was gang-raped by the duo and was forced to accompany them to a hotel.
 
 The girl alleged that she informed her class teacher as well as the principal and director of the school about the wrongdoings but no action was taken against the accused and she continued to face the trauma. The girl also copied the chief minister office and DGP on her email and threatened to commit suicide if no action was taken.
 
 Acting on the govern ment's response to the mail, the police have formed a special investigative team (SIT), led by DSP  , to probe the case. The SIT on Sunday procured   footage of the school campus in  , 30km from Sonipat, and also questioned the two employees ­ a clerk and an accountant named by the survivor.The police have also collected the mobile phone details of the accused.
 
 SP   said besides collecting the school's digital records, the SIT also questioned the management and teachers in charge of various classes. Gupta said the SIT and local police officials took a round of the school premises and directed the owners of local hotels to submit their records at the police station.
 
 “Since this was an anonymous complaint, we need the survivor to identify the culprits in such cases. We have conveyed this to the school and are flashing messages through social media. The aggrieved must come forward. We assure her full security as well secrecy ,''   police station SHO Kuldeep Deswal said.
