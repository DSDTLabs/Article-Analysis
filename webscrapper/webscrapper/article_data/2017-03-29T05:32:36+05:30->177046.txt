IDUKKI: Devikulam MLA   said on Tuesday that administrative reforms committee chairman and CPM leader V S Achuthanandan was targeting him as he had criticised his confidant   on Saturday. He said it was after the arrival of Suresh at Munnar that the issue invited media attention, adding that he did not blame the revenue minister or Devikulam sub-collector for the demolition drive.

 “Most of the encroachments in Munnar are by big shots, including media barons,” he said.
 
 “It seems now the eight cents I am possessing is the problem. If I give it away, will everything be solved?” he asked, adding that three tehsildars had checked the property before issuing the title deed.
