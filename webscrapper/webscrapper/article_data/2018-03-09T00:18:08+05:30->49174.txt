Pimpri Chinchwad: The postal department has approved the demand of Maval MP Shrirang Barne to release a postal stamp on Krantiveer Chapekar. 

 Barne of Shiv Sena had met Union minister Manoj Sinha in February seeking a postal stamp release on April 18, the death anniversary of Damodar Chapekar. He was hanged for killing British officer WC Rand in Pune in 1898. 
 
 Barne has been following up this demand with the Union ministry of communications for three years. He submitted evidence about the Chapekar brothers in the freedom struggle. Girish Prabhune, president of Chapekar Smarak Samiti, helped Barne collect them. 
 
 Sinha, during the meeting on Thursday, said the postal stamp will be released on April 18.
