Nagpur: After completion of oral arguments from defence and prosecution sides, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Tuesday, directed Naxalites — Prashant Rahi alias Narayan Sanglikar and Vijay Tirki — to file a detail reply in a week on old and new contentions raised by the government for opposing their bail pleas. 

 Appearing for accused, Surendra Gadling, earlier, contended that Tirki was innocent and had no role in the entire episode. Opposing his contentions, special public prosecutor Prashant Sathianathan argued that Tirki was a part of bigger conspiracy and he was acting as a courier between urban Maoists and their counterparts in the rural areas. He pointed out that Tirki, being a resident of Kanker in Chhattisgarh, failed to answer satisfactorily on what he was doing in Gondia when he was arrested along with Rahi.
