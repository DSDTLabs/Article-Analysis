Madurai: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Tuesday closed a case that accused the authorities of failing to take action against a group of individuals who were running a   in Thanjavur district, after the government informed the court that the shop has been shut. 

 One Varadarajan from Peravoorani village in Thanjavur filed a case. It came up for hearing before the division bench of justices M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha. The petitioner’s counsel told the court that there are more than 100 families in the village. Many members of the families are agricultural coolies.
 
 There, two people – Prabakaran and Srinivasan, obtained licence to sell palm beverage (pathaneer). But, they are selling toddy mixed with a kind of drug in their shop, which is against the law. By that, they are ruining the lives of youths in and around Peravoorani village. 
 
 The issue was taken to the notice of the Thanjavur district collector and the superintendent of police. But, there was no action from them. Hence, it was necessary to direct the officials to take action against the people who run the toddy shop and to remove it, the counsel prayed. 
 
 The government counsel told the court that the authorities had already taken steps regarding the issue and closed the shop. Following it, the bench closed the case.
