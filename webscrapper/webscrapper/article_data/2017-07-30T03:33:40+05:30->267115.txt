MUMBAI: Bombay high court has sought Balbharti’s reply on a plea which seeks to delete a chapter in a Class IX history text wherein Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, militant leader of the Khalistani movement, is referred to as a “terrorist”.

 A bench headed by Justice Anoop Mohta heard a petition by   resident Amritpalsingh Khalsa, a law student, which says that Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbooks Production and Curriculum Research (popularly known as Balbharti) has spread “vicious propaganda against the Sikh struggle movement” and “shaheed Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was called terrorist with other shaheeds”. 
 
 The petition said Bhindranwale “was not named in any FIR ever in his life yet the textbook chose to propagate false information by stating that Santji was arrested by police”. It says “whereas only total of 36 corpses were found, the state textbook depicts the   as if more than 1,000 so-called terrorists were hiding in the   ( )”.
 
 It has urged, among other prayers, that the court direct Balbharti to tender apology to the Sikh community for its depiction of militancy in Punjab and direct the police to register criminal complaints against its staff, including one for outraging religious feelings.
 
 At an earlier hearing, the HC declined interim relief to omit the reference unless it hears the parties. It noted that the textbook is being circulated since April 28. On June 27, Balbharati advocate sought time for a reply. The HC will hear the matter after four weeks.
