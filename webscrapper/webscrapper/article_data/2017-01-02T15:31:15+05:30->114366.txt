   Ajay Shirke 
 
 , the BCCI secretary.

 
 
  
 The Justice RM Lodha Committeeâ€™s recommendations for a revamp of the BCCI were also taken into serious consideration, with the SC disqualifying all the board and its state association office bearers who have failed to meet the new norms set by the panel. The SC will replace the top brass of the BCCI with a new panel of administrators, also to be decided on January 19.
 
 The bench, led by Chief Justice of India TS Thakur, had in the previous hearing on December 15 threatened to initiate perjury charges against Anurag Thakur for allegedly lying about asking the International Cricket Council (ICC) to term the Lodha reforms as governmental interference. During that hearing, Subramaniam told then Chief Justice of India TS Thakur that Anurag Thakur had lied on oath to the SC, having written in his affidavit that he had sought Shashank Manohar's opinion as ICC chairman. Subramanian argued that since Manohar had denied Anurag Thakur by saying that the question had been posed during an ICC meeting, the BCCI president had tried to obstruct the reform process. 
 
 The SC appointed senior advocates Fali S Nariman and Gopal Subramaniam as amicus curiae and asked them to suggest the names of those deemed capable of administering the BCCI.
 
 The SC had threatened Anurag Thakur with a jail term if he was found guilty of lying under oath in an attempt to obstruct the Lodha Committee reforms, but reserved its order on a verdict.
