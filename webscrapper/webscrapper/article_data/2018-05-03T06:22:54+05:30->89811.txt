BENGALURU:   CEO   said on Tuesday that in India, the company set a new first-half record (the company’s fiscal year begins in October). “We continue to put great energy there...our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else,” he said in a post-earnings call.

 
 Cook did not provide any India specific numbers. He, however, noted that India is the third-largest smartphone market in the world and said there are huge opportunities there for Apple. “...we have extremely low share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of energy there and working with the carriers in that market, and they're investing enormously on the LTE (high-speed wireless) networks. And the infrastructure has come quite a ways since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth,” he said.
 
 Shobhit Srivastava, research analyst in  , which estimates mobile phone shipments, told TOI that India continues to be a challenging but high growth market for Apple. “The increasing installed base of iPhones is a good sign, given the strong stickiness and aspiration value of the brand. It will likely drive upgrades for the brand in future,” he said.
