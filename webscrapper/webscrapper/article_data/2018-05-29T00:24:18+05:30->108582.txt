NEW DELHI: In less than 24 hours of the opening of the   ( ), “speeding” has emerged as the biggest concern for those managing the   on this 135 km stretch. Some of the persons managing the expressway TOI talked to said there is hardly any respect for traffic rules and there is a dire need to deploy speed guns and other devices to catch violators. 

 Though National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has an elaborate plan to install smart traffic management system with real time monitoring of vehicle movement to capture violations, it will take another four to six months. “The NHAI should hire services of entities who can deploy speed gun and mobile devices for mapping violations. They need to take the local police on board so that on the spot action can be taken based on the electronic evidence,” said an executive responsible for one stretch of the expressway.
 
 NHAI sources said they will take necessary measures to deal with the situation rather than wait for the entire system to be in place. Officials said the traffic flow has increased substantially in the past one day since the road was opened. For truckers, it’s a big relief as they can avoid paying   and can avoid Delhi which allows them in only for limited hours. 
 
 Highway authority officials said there were incidences of people driving in reverse direction on the first day. “We have deployed our people in plainclothes at each entry and exit points to stop people from driving against the flow of traffic. From Tuesday, we will deploy men in uniform to check the menace,” an official said. 
 
 On Monday, Delhi Traffic Police said they turned about 50,000 heavy vehicles from border so that they can use the expressway. NHAI will carry out a detailed count of vehicles using the expressway in the next couple of days.
