PUNE: The 11 merged  , looking forward to major infrastructure development, can expect a push for projects in the coming fiscal with a proposed allocation of Rs52 crore in the draft budget presented by the municipal commissioner on Monday. 

 The villages were   with the   body in October last year. However, funds are yet to be allocated to the villages. Local residents have pointed that most areas have witnessed haphazard growth over the years therefore large efforts are required to extend infrastructural services in new areas.
 
 A senior official said allocation of Rs52 crore is crucial to begin extension of services. He added that besides budgetary allocation, the standing committee recently decided to set aside Rs33 crore for the newly merged villages. Roughly, every village would receive Rs3 crore. A combined allotment for the villages would turn out to be Rs85 crore for the next fiscal, the official said.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Elected representatives have been pushing for more allocations for new areas. Mayor Mukta Tilak had even written to the civic chief as well as the state government urging for minimum allotment of Rs100 crore for these areas.
 
 A corporator from Bavdhan explained, “There are issues of garbage, roads, and sewage. People face severe water shortage and are dependant on water tankers. Very few areas have last mile connectivity. The civic administration needs to set aside funds at least for the next five years.”
 
 The administration would begin revenue collection in the merged villages from the new fiscal and expects a revenue of Rs56 crore. The draft budget has also proposed preparation of a development plan of the newly merged villages.
