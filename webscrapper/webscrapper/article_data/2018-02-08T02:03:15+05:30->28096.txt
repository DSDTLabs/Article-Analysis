NEW DELHI: Family members of ‘honour killing’ victim   have expressed dissatisfaction over the compensation amount promised to them by the Delhi government. The family met chief minister   on Wednesday morning and was promised a sum of Rs 5 lakh by him, which they have termed insufficient.

 Speaking after the meeting, Saxena’s cousin Ashish Duggal said that the state government should owe some responsibility for the incident.
 
 “We are disappointed with the amount that has been promised to us. Initially, everyone approached us and promised to offer help but now nothing much reached us in reality,” Duggal said.
 
 Sharing the details about the meeting with the chief minister, family members said that they were told that they will be receiving a sum of Rs 5 lakh as per the government rules. Apart from that, they will also be provided assistance in getting treatment for Saxena’s mother, who sustained some injuries while trying to save her son and suffered shock following his death.
 
 Subsequently, the family has reiterated their demand to get justice for Ankit’s death as quickly as possible.
 
 “We were hoping for a better financial assistance as the family has lost its lone breadwinner in the incident. Ankit’s father has had multiple heart surgeries and doesn’t have any source of income. His mother is also a housewife. The five lakh provided by the government won’t help them for long. We would request that a stable and regular pension be provided to the victim’s mother and father,” Duggal said.
 
 The family has also requested that the good lawyer be provided to them to fight their case along with some security to Ankit’s parents.
 
 “There are many other relatives of the accused family, we fear that they might attack Ankit’s parents in the future. The police should provide some security to them as they are feeling vulnerable,” the victim’s cousin said.
