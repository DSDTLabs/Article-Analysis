 had to leave her graduation course in   midway to pursue her acting career in Mumbai, but says that she has great memories of the little time she spent in the NIFT campus. “I have some amazing friends here. They were with me in NIFT and are now designers and doing really well in life,” she tells us.

 "For the last few years, I have been in Delhi only for work, or make a brief stop here while travelling. I miss meeting my friends here," says the TV actress, who is now part of the show Chandrakanta. She was in Delhi recently, and took out time to visit Mandi House. "I was a frequent visitor to   – be it Triveni   or  . I used to watch plays and classical dance performances. This is one place in Delhi that introduced me to the cultural aspect of the city, and I fell in love with it. Now, when I visit this place after so many years, I realise that though the infrastructure has changed, that spirit, that culture that Mandi House was known for, is still there," she adds.
