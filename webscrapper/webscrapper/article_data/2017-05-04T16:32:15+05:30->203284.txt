PATNA: As Bihar is the first state to have adopted Sendai Framework in India, it is sending its four-member delegation from its disaster management department (DMD), headed by its minister Chandrashekhar, to Cancum in   to participate in the weeklong global conference on disaster risk reduction (DRR) from May 18. The Bihar experience in tackling natural disasters, for that matter, could be a matter of immense interest at the global conference.
 
  The Cancum conference is the first such meet after the voluntary and non-binding agreement reached by the member countries of the UN on Sendai Framework (2015-30) that was organized under the aegis of   for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) in 2015. It was pegged to the aim of reducing the loss of lives, livelihood and health, as also assets, in the disaster situations.
  
  The remaining three members of the Bihar delegation include DMD principal secretary  , its officer on special duty ( ) Sandeep Kumar and personal secretary to the minister  , DMD sources said.
  
  Sources said no other state has as yet adopted the Sendai Framework. The Centre, which is most likely to send its delegation as India is signatory to the Sendai Framework, has also requested the respected state governments to send their delegation to the Cancum conference.
