KOCHI: The Rs 6,500-crore coastal highway plan is facing a hurdle as   (KIIFB) is insisting on constructing roads with a width of 12m. But, public works department (PWD) has already prepared detailed project reports (DPR) where the width of the 656km highway would be 8m. DPRs of 13 reaches have been sent to  , but it has not cleared it so far.

 PWD’s stance is that largescale acquisition of land in densely populated coastal areas is impractical. “Along most stretches, except certain areas in Malappuram, the width can’t go beyond 8m. So, we prepared the report that envisaged a width of 8m. But, KIIFB is not ready to clear our proposals,” said a top official with PWD.
 
 The government has already issued notification announcing the alignment of coastal highway along nine districts. The highway starting from Poovar in Thiruvananthapuram will go through Kollam, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode and   before ending at Thalappady in  . “If width is limited to 8m, evictions can be minimized. The project won’t work if we go for 12m along the entire stretch,” the official said.
 
 At the same time, the tender for construction on four reaches of the hill highway project will start soon. “KIIFB has already given approval for four reaches. The proposals for 23 reaches are pending before the agency and it is expected to clear them without delay,” said the PWD official.
 
 As per the present alignment prepared by National Transportation Planning and Research Centre, the hill highway will start from Nandarappadavu in Kasaragod and end at   in Thiruvananthapuram. The cost estimate for the 1267-km hill highway project is pegged at Rs 3,500 crore.
