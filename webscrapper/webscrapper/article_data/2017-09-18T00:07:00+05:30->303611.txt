Pune: The Raigad police on Saturday booked 10 people for attempting to kill a manager and a driver of a prominent land developer from the city on Kapurhol-Saswad Road on Friday afternoon. 

 The suspects, who were travelling in a multi-utility vehicle, picked up a fight with the employees of the land developer claiming that they were driving rashly and then beat them up.
 
 Both sustained fractures in their arms and legs, police said. The 28-year-old manager, a resident of Kalyaninagar, lodged a police complaint. The complainant said he and the driver were heading towards Satara. A speeding MUV overtook their car and forced it to halt near Kumbhoshi Phata around 3pm. 
 
 The suspects abused the occupants saying that the car had brushed against their MUV. They pulled them out and thrashed both with planks and sticks procured from a shop selling agricultural equipment in the vicinity.
 
 Police said it could be road rage or some previous enmity. They are investigating if the developer upset locals while acquiring land in Purandar. tnn
