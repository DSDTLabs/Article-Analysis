 Reports suggest that while finalising the actor for Tanaji's role, Lanjekar has the reference of the bust of the warrior at Sinhagad in mind.The first image that comes to mind when we hear Tanaji's name is that of a well-built, tall man sporting a pagdi and huge moustache. Rest assured, Yadav's first look, which was released on Monday, meets all these expectations.
