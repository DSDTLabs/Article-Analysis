Actress   inaugurated an arts and crafts pop-up show recently in the city. The show had a wide variety of arts and crafts from various parts of the country and some were indeed stunning creations. Socialities scanned through the textiles and wooden artefacts with much gusto. 

 Shobana looked gorgeous in a flower-printed sari. Spotted on the occasion were Mathangi and Biju, who looked every bit ethnic in saris. Siddhi turned out to be the cynosure of all eyes with her black-and-gold sari and long-sleeved blouse, as she happily posed for the shutterbugs.
