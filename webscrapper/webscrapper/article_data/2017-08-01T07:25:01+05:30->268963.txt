MUMBAI: State agriculture minister   told the state council on Monday that he has asked the Centre for a 15 day extension for applications from the state for the Prime Minister's   scheme. The deadline ended on July 31st. 

 "We have asked for an extension till August 15th. I will personally be visiting the union agriculture minister in Delhi. I have been in touch with other states on the same issue," said Phundkar. 
 
 He also declared a compensation of Rs 5 lakhs for Rama Potre, a farmer who reportedly died while standing in a bank queue to apply for the insurance scheme. "The post-mortem report is awaited but we have decided to award compensation," he said. 
 
 Phundkar said if banks were not cooperating on the scheme, the state would inquire against them. "There has been a good monsoon this year so the applications for the crop insurance scheme have reduced. But the government is trying to ensure that the deadline is extended," he said. 
 
 Earlier the Opposition had created a ruckus demanding the extension of the scheme leading to the state council being adjourned twice. The Opposition also demanded that forms for the scheme be accepted offline.
