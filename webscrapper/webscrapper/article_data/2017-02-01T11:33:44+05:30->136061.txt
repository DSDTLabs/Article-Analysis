 On December 9, 2016, while the ‘Jan Jagruti Padyatra’ made its way through   constituency, three aspirants for the Congress ticket Edwin Baretto,   and Anthony Pinto held hands in public and vowed to support each other, irrespective of who bagged the ticket.
 
  Today, with less than a week to go for elections, the camaraderie has faded, after Congress decided to grant the ticket to its Benaulim block president Edwin Baretto, who has been with the party for 20 years.
  
  Nazario Pinto, who has been negotiating with the Congress on behalf of his brother Anthony, has hit out at GPCC president   and Baretto, tagging him a “dummy candidate who will facilitate Churchill Alemao’s win in Benaulim”.
  
  The curious case of the Pinto brothers baffled many as Nazario was involved in all the negotiations with the party for his brother’s candidature, even travelling to Delhi to meet the Congress high command.
  
  Anthony is a caterer by profession and has been Varca sarpanch for the last 14 years. Sources said that the negotiations in Delhi probably failed because the high command in Delhi was informed of the Pintos’ campaign for Caitu in the run-up to the 2012 elections.
  
  Today, the Pintos are back in Caitu’s camp, when it is popularly understood that he is being supported by BJP. Nazario said Baretto, as block president, has not carried out any programmes for the party.
  
 Rebello too turned bitter after the Congress denied her a ticket and blamed Faleiro for the betrayal. She is now contesting on a Goa vikas party (GVP) ticket.
