LUCKNOW:   MP from Unnao   embarrassed the party by inaugurating a night club in Lucknow on Sunday evening. Left red-faced, the saffronclad ‘Maharaj’ lodged a complaint with UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey on Monday, seeking action against party’s former state general secretary Rajjan Singh, who had requested him to inaugurate ‘Let’s Meet Night Club’. 

 Sakshi lodged a complaint with SSP Lucknow saying he was invited by Singh to inaugurate a ‘restaurant.’ “I was in a hurry since I had to catch a flight to Delhi. It was only later that I came to know that it was not a restaurant but a night club,” the MP wrote in his complaint, while demanding investigation and registration of case under section 420 of the IPC (cheating). 
 
 “I was told by Singh it was a restaurant owned by his son-in-law. Initially, I was averse to the idea of inaugurating it but then I agreed. I was cheated,” the MP told TOI. “It is certainly embarrassing for me since I am not only an MP but also a ‘sadhu,’” he said. “Kuch samajh hi nahi aayaa...us samay wahan koi sandigdh gatividhiyan dikhi bhi nahi (I couldn’t doubt anything then since no shady activity was seen there at the time),” he said. Pandey refused to comment saying he was pre-occu-pied with nomination of candidates for legislative council elections. 
 
 Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, however, defended Sakshi saying he may not have been aware of the reality. The incident gave opposition fresh ammunition against BJP. “This shows the dual character of BJP. Sakshi Maharaj needs to tell us if any ‘pooja paath’ was organised in the night club,” SP spokesperson MLC Sunil Singh Sajan said.
