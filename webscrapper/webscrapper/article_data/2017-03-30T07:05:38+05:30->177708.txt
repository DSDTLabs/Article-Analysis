NEW DELHI:   supremo  , possibly affected by the drubbing his party got in the recent UP polls, on Wednesday chose to talk about everything but GST during the debate on the tax reform measure.

 The only times he brought up GST was when he complained how the government, by giving the tax an English acronym, had deprived those living in villages of an understanding of its intricacies. He also said as villages, poor people and farmers were contributing maximum to the economy by paying rail and even airfare, the   should be enacted.
 
 Yadav, while participating in an otherwise serious debate, hopped from one unconnected subject to another, starting with farmer suicides and bringing in unemployment, women forced to go hungry to feed their families and people not having enough clothes to protect their bodies from ‘loo’ (hot summer winds) to lamenting how his party lost in UP due to BJP’s “false promises”. At one point of time, the chair even reminded Yadav that the debate was on GST bill and that he should speak on the subject.
 
 Unaffected, Yadav continued to underline how the BJP government should rather focus on women’s welfare and deliver on its pre-poll promises. The voters of UP may have rejected his party’s “development and welfare” plank, but Yadav used the GST debate to laboriously list various measures and schemes implemented by the erstwhile   government. “Let anybody in the House point out what we have not done (in UP).
 
 But it’s another thing we lost. Education, irrigation and medical care is free in UP. Whether it’s cancer or any other disease, it is treated for free. We also sponsor treatment of patients abroad. But we still lost... and it is due to your false promises,” Yadav said while pointing to the treasury MPs who looked amused.
