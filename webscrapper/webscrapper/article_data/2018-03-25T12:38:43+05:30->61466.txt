Sandipta Sen, who plays   in  , a daily soap aired on Star Jalsha, is shuffling between characters! In the last episode of the serial, Sandipta was seen in the avatar of a baba! Her character Shimul disguises herself to stop her mother-in-law,  , from joining the office. Clad in a saffron attire and sporting white flowy hair and beard, Sandipta is almost unrecognisable as Kitkit baba. The actress, who has earlier played characters like   and   on the same show, went on to share pictures on social media asking her friends and fans whether they recognise her. Speaking of getting into the skin of the character, Sandipta said, "I have been juggling between too many characters on Protidaan. From Shimul to Shiuli to another disguise in college — I have been in and out of characters for the past 7 months!"

 Although playing so many different characters is no mean feat, Sandipta isn't complaining. "I don't remember any actress getting married in a show in a disguise! This was one of a kind. Not everyone gets a chance to sport so many looks in one mega serial. It takes a long time to get into the skin of each character — beard, wig and skin colour in place. It’s hectic but I'm loving it — it's interesting and challenging. Voice modulation is an important factor when it comes to playing the characters. When I was disguising as Shiuli, I had a high-pitched, shrill voice — completely different from my original voice.”
 
 That's not all. Sandipta will soon be seen playing another character in the serial. "It's very innovative and the track will run for a while. I can't reveal much about it but I'm sure the viewers will love me in that character," the actress said, signing off.
