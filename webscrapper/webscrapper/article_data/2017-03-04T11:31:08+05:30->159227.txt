Ishita is in a bad mood and loses her cool on everybody. She sees Pihu using makeup and shouts at her. Ishita blames Gulabo for not doing her job properly. Pihu shouts back on Ishita leaving her shocked.
 
  Gulabo goes to Pihu and asks her to apologize to Ishita. She agrees and goes to Ishita. The two hug. Ishita then apologizes to Gulabo for over reacting. She then tells her that Raman has been the reason for all of this. He has no interest in his family anymore and she is upset. Gulabo decides to cheer her up.
  
  
 
  
  Next day, Gulabo goes to Ishita and tells her about the dream she had about her and Raman. She also said that she has a feeling that Raman will call her up today and take her out. Ishita laughs off.
  
  Gulabo then takes permission to leave early. Raman calls Ishita and apologizes for being so busy. He then asks her out for dinner.
  
  The two meet at a restaurant and Raman holds her hand to take her to the table. On the other hand, Nidhi is thinking about Raman and Gulabo's connection when the door bell rings. She gets shocked to see the police.
