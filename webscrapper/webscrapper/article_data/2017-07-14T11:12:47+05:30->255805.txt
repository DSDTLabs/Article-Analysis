AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court on Thursday directed the investigating agency to place before it all case papers from earlier investigations conducted in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case.

 The court asked for all investigation papers to be placed before it in response to an application filed by accused cop Tarun Barot, who is out on bail in this case and was re-appointed DySP by the state government after his retirement. He complained that the CBI has conveniently not furnished various documents, statements of witnesses and FSL reports gathered in earlier investigations. He urged the court to call for all probe papers under section 91 of the CrPC. This move was opposed by the CBI.
 
 Barot filed this application because the case was investigated thrice and the outcomes have been contradictory. City crime branch investigated the case first, immediately after four persons including Ishrat were gunned down by crime branch officials. The first probe had called the encounter “genuine”.
 
 A second probe was ordered by Gujarat high court which also set up a special investigation team (SIT). It concluded that the four persons were killed while they were in police custody. The HC later handed the investigation to the CBI, which filed a chargesheet against eight cops including Barot, DIG D   and the now retired DGP P P Pandey. The CBI filed an additional chargesheet against four officials of the Central  , but as the CBI did not secure sanction to prosecute the intelligence officers, the court has not taken cognizance of the second chargesheet.
 
 Ishrat and three others Pranesh Pillai, Jishan Zohar and  , were shot dead on June 15, 2004 at Kotarpur and were dubbed Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives who were in Gujarat to kill then chief minister Narendra Modi to avenge the 2002 riots.
