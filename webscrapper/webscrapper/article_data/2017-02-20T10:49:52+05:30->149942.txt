NAGPUR: In a rare and explicit lecture on sex education, a city maulana and community counsellors on Sunday afternoon blamed smartphones, WhatsApp and Facebook for addiction to pornography and impotency among Muslim youths. 

 Openly referring to sexually intercourse and masturbation, terms which are considered taboo in the community, they said unlimited access to high speed Internet is drifting Muslim youths from the right path. The speakers included Maulana Atique-ur-Rehman of Assaqafatur Razaviya, Satranjipura, and unani physicians Mohammad Zakir, Bakhtiyar Ghazi, Illyas Noori and  . Psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani spoke on psychological disorders arising from misuse of Internet. Earlier, the organization had given a call against kite flying and splurging on marriages.
 
 The lecture was attended by over 500 people at  . 
 
 The 31-year-old Maulana Rehman’s 30-minute speech focused mainly on the damage masturbation causes to youth. “You may have attended many religious discourses. This too is a discourse, but a different one. You need to protect your youth. They are watching porn on phones and are lost in thinking about sex. Then they want to do what they have seen. Their blood starts boiling. If they are unmarried, they resort to illegitimate sex or use their hand,” he said.
 
 “Indulging in masturbation causes irreparable damage to the organ. Sexual power is given to you not to waste in masturbation but to create progeny,” he added.
 
 Referring to Arabic text al-Qanun at-Tibb ( ), he said, “The semen must circulate in blood. It makes you strong and confident. Those who masturbate are facing problems of liquid discharge and impotency. They must give up the bad habit.”
 
 He however said that it is difficult to give up bad habits for some and they continue to masturbate or visit prostitutes even after marriage. “They never reform. So fear the Almighty,” he said.
 
 In an aggressive tone, he also advised youths to throw away mobile phones and use simple ones to only make calls. “Will you die if you don’t use WhatsApp or Facebook,” he asked, adding, “Youngsters remain awake till 2 or 3am, watching porn materials on mobiles. They can be seen hiding in narrow lanes late in the night.”
 
 Well-known city sexologist Dr Sanjay Deshpande, who is chairman of   & Parenthood International, rubbished the theory that masturbation causes any physical harm. “It is an Asian myth and not connected to any religion. Masturbation doesn’t lead to impotency. Only if it is compulsive where the person indulges in the act anywhere and anytime, it is said to be a psychological disorder.”
