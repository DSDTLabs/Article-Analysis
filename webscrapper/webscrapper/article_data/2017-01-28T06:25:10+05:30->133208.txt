NOIDA: Home minister  's son Pankaj surprisingly made no mention of 'notebandi' or 'kala dhan' as he hit the campaign trail in Noida on Friday. Instead, he made a shrill pitch to defend 'Bharat Mata' against traitors and hailed the cross-LoC "surgical strikes" last September. 

 The words conveyed the sense that BJP would fall back on the nationalism theme rather than hardsell demonetisation to win the battle for UP, which if true would be a stunning turnaround from the bullish mood in the party on 'notebandi' in November and December. 
 
 Pankaj, despite his lineage, is no heavyweight and cannot be called a spokesperson for BJP. But BJP wouldn't send out the home minister's son into battle without a well-rehearsed campaign line endorsed by the party.
 
 Pankaj's speech was laced with references to events in the more distant past rather than the ongoing battle against black money that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described demonetisation as. Mostly, it was the controversy at JNU last year that Pankaj stuck to, claiming students raised slogans of "Afzal zindabaad" (a reference to Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru) and "Bharat Mata ke tukde honge", and calling them "traitors".
