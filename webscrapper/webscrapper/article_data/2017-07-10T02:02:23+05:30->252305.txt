MUMBAI: Three men, who posed as crime branch officers, accosted a garment dealer’s employee, forced him to get into a   at  , threatened him and fled with his bag that contained his employer’s Rs 30 lakh. 

 The V P Road police have registered a case of kidnapping with intent to wrongfully confine person, personating a public servant and cheating against the three unidentified accused. The police suspect an insider’s role as the robbers were aware that the victim was carrying a lot of money. 
 
 In his police complaint, Maffaram Devrashi (27) said on Friday, after collecting Rs 30 lakh from another garment dealer in Bhuleshwar he was walking back to his shop in the area, when the three men stopped him. They claimed they were crime branch officers and asked him what was in the bag. When he told him that he was ferrying his employer’s money, they forced him to sit in a taxi around 4.30pm.
 
 They ‘interrogated’ him as the taxi drove around the area and threatened to beat him up if he screamed for help, Devrashi claimed. Around 6pm, they stopped the taxi and fled with the bag that contained 10 wads of Rs 2,000 (totalling to Rs 20 lakh) and 20 wads of Rs 500 (totalling to Rs 10 lakh) and Devrashi’s two mobile phones.
 
 The police are scanning the call data records of phones used in the area at the time of the incident to get some leads to nab the robbers.
