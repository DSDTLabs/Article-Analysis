AHMEDABAD: A 26-year-old youth from Anand has filed a complaint with   police station of being cheated of Rs2.8 lakh after he was lured by the prospect of a job in Bangkok. 

 According to Navrangpura police, Arpan Patel, 26, a resident of Patel Society, Anand, had come across an advertisement online through social media about one and a half months ago, in which a firm based at Kalindi Complex near   in Navrangpura, had promised a data entry job for a US-based company where applicants had to relocate to Bangkok, Thailand.
 
 “Patel approached the office address where he met one Jignesh Rathod. Rathod told him that he would be paid $650 as salary and $300 for lodging and boarding a month. Patel agreed and provided Rathod documents and Rs 2.8 lakh in six cheques from his father’s account,” said a police investigator.
 
 Patel went to Bangkok from Kolkata on September 4 and came to know that apart from him, two other youths, Rupal Jodhani, 21, and Kaushal Gojariya, 19, had approached the firm for the said job. Patel mentioned in his complaint that  , an associate of Rathod, took them to a business complex and showed them around but did not talk about the job.
 
 “When Rathod or Roy could not be contacted for four days, all three returned to Gujarat, after which Patel filed the complaint. Further probe is on,” said an official.
