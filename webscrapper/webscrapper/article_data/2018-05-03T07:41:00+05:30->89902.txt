Chandigarh: The process for the selection of director principal at the Government Medical College and Hospital   32 has started with the advertisement of the post. As the upper age limit has been finalized at 58 years, most of the professors have applied for the vacancy.

 According to sources, the top three contenders are Dr B S Chavan, present officiating director principal, Dr Atul Sachdev, head of the medicine department, and Dr Sudhir Garg, head of the orthopaedics department, also the in-charge of the computerization programme in the medical college.
 
 Dr Atul had been the director principal at the GMCH last year until his tenure ended. However, as the post was advertised recently, those who have applied need to get the clearance from the vigilance bureau.
 
 Officials say the recruitment rules of the medical college give preference to deputation. However, as there is now a common seniority list, there should not be an internal deputation. “Therefore, this should allow doctors from outside the institute to apply for the post,” said an official.
 
 Almost a year ago, the UPSC had conveyed to the UT health department to either reduce the tenure of the post of the director principal to three years if the maximum age for the eligibility was 59 years or make it 5 years if the maximum age for the eligibility was 57 years. The department of personnel and training approved the age as 58 years for a term of five years or until the age of the retirement. The age of the retirement for the director principal is 62 years.
 
 Appointment of the new director principal is significant for the medical college as the Medical Council of India (MCI) had raised objections for granting recognition to 23 post graduate seats in the college which were started in 2014.
