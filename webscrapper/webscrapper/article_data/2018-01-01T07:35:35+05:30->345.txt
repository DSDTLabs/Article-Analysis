HYDERABAD: After spending almost six months in prison, 29-year-old musician   Mascerenhas, one of the main alleged drug peddlers arrested by prohibition and excise sleuths in 2017, walked out of jail on Sunday. As excise sleuths failed to file a chargesheet within the mandatory period, he could secure bail. 

 On July 2, excise sleuths had arrested three drug peddlers,  , of Old Bowenpally, Md  , 20, a student from   in Chandrayangutta, and his brother, Md Abdul Quddus, 29, a private employee from Chandrayangutta. Police seized 700 blots of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 35 grams of methylene dioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) from their possession. On interrogation, Calvin reportedly confessed that he was procuring the drugs by placing orders on dark web market places like   Road and Camel 7.2. Excise sleuths claimed Calvin was paying in   to procure the contraband.
