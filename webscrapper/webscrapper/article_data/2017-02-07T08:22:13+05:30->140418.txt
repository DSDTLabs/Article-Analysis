NEW DELHI: In a blow to  , 24 co-pilots of its "turnaround vehicle", the  , sought no objection certificate (NOC) to quit the airline over alleged lack of career progression on Monday. 

 Air India had ordered 27   in 2005 and has so far got 23 of these fuel-efficient planes which are now its workhorses. The airline has about 300 pilots for these planes. 
 
  The 24 pilots who have sought NOC had joined erstwhile   in 2007-08 and used to fly the Airbus A-320s. In 2012 when AI was getting ready to receive the Dreamliners, they were put on training to fly this plane. 
 
 Their grouse emerges from the fact that people who joined the airline after them as co-pilots are becoming commanders on the A-320 while they remain co-pilots on the Boeing-787.
