CHANDIGARH: Vice-President and Chancellor of   M Venkaiah Naidu will consider following the Union ministry of human resource and development (MHRD) regulations to advertise for the post of the V-C, said top sources. The issue was discussed in the first meeting held for the appointment of the new V-C at the Vice-President secretariat in New Delhi, where the   submitted a draft on Friday.

 “I have submitted the   on the PU calendar for advertising the post of the new VC. They said they would be evaluating it and would be considering the MHRD directions. It is the prerogative of the chancellor,” said PU registrar Col GS Chadha (retd).
 
 
 The major point of difference between following the   and PU calendar is the specification of age. According to the PU calendar, there is no embargo on the age but the age limit has been specified in the PU calendar. The calendar says the chancellor can appoint anybody for a term of three years and the extension can be given to the V-C by the chancellor as per his discretion. Whereas the MHRD says that the candidates who are applying as on date should be below 60 years of ago. Moreover, as per MHRD, 10 years of professorship is a qualification which is required to become the VC of a University. Such norm is not there in the PU calendar.
 
 Moreover, the post of PU V-C will be advertised by March 31, said sources. The Chancellor’s office had sent a communication to the registrar office on March 19 asking the registrar to send a draft to his office about the advertising and appointing procedure of the new VC as per the PU calendar.
 
 Once the advertisement is released, the Chancellor’s office will receive applications for the post. A committee will be formed to screen these applications and shortlisted ones would be interviewed. Following this, three names would be selected and sent to the Chancellor for the final call.
