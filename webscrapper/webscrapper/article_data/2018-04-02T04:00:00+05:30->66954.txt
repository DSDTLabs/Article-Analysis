Chennai: With large deals drying up, private Equity firms invested about $3.7 billion (across 133 deals) during the quarter ended March 2018 down 49% compared to the $7.3 billion (across 200 transactions) in the same period last year and down 29% on a sequential basis. “The latest quarter witnessed only 9 PE investments worth $100 million or more compared to 13 such transactions in the same period last year,” said out Arun Natarajan, CEO of Venture Intelligence. “Also notable was the fact that Softbank — which dominated 2017 with its mega e-commerce bets on Flipkart, Paytm, Ola and Oyo — did not figure among the top ten deals in Q1 2018,” he added.

 The only Indian investment by the Japanese investment giant so far in 2018 has been the relatively small follow-on investment (Rs 400 crore or $61mn) in Grofers.
 
 The largest PE investment during the January — March was the $1.06 billion preferential allotment by mortgage lender HDFC to investors including GIC, KKR and others (including Canada Pension Plan OMERS, Carmignac Group and Premji Invest). This was followed by the $275 million investment by TPG Capital in the resultant entity of the proposed merger between Manipal Hospitals and Fortis Healthcare.
 
 On the back of $1.5 billion investments in NBFC companies, BFSI accounted for 51% of the PE investment value pie attracting $1.9 billion across 14 transactions. Led by Tencent’s investment in Gaana.com, IT and ITeS companies came in next attracting $927 million across 79 PE investments, followed by Healthcare; Life Sciences companies which attracted $361 million across 9 transactions (led by the TPG - Manipal Health Enterprise deal). 
 
 PE investments hit an all time high of $ 21 billion in 2017, recording a 54% jump in value terms over 2016, largely driven by big-ticket transactions, said Grant Thorton report. The significant rise in PE deal values in 2017, despite a 24% decline in number of deals over 2016, signals revival of big ticket investments, said Grant Thorton.
