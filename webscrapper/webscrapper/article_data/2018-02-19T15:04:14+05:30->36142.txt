PATNA: The   (BSEB) has barred students appearing for Class X exams from entering the examination centres with shoes and socks. Only slippers will be allowed inside the   halls.

 This is for the first time that the exam board has issued such an advisory to check use of unfair means by the examinees. BSEB chairman   said the advisory would be communicated to all the district education officers, centre superintendents, students and their guardians. The Matric exams will begin on February 21.
 
 State education minister   has appreciated the move. “The aim is to prevent malpractices,” he said, adding the Class 12 examinations were comparatively free and fair this year. “Thanks to tough measures adopted by the BSEB, the mentality of students has changed. They now know that only knowledge attained through hard work will ensure their success.”
 
 More than 1,000 Intermediate examinees were expelled this year and 25 impersonators arrested. More than 17.6 lakh students will write the   at 1,426 centres across the state this year.
