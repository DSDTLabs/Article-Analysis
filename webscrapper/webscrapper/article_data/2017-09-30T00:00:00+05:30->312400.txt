Brush up on some   buying basics.

 A watch might seem like a non-descriptive part of a man’s wardrobe but it actually makes a big difference to the way he looks. There is a huge selection of watches out there and it can get quite confusing when you go out shopping for a watch.
 
 
 
 An analog watch is the traditional type of watch with hour and minute hands and numbers or markers that show the twelve hour day. It is considered to be a formal watch. Digital watches on the other hand have a LCD or LED face that displays the time in numerals and are casual compared to the formal analog watches.
 
 
 
 Digital watches run using a special battery, while quartz watches are powered by a vibrating, electrified crystal.
 
 
 
 The case or the frame of the watch can be in any shape – round, rectangular, square or even polygonal. Even the finish of the watch can vary. Steer clear of jewel-encrusted watches because they cannot be worn to any formal business event.
 
 
 
 The cover that protects the face of the watch is called the watch crystal. It’s usually made with resistant and toughened plexiglass, traditional glass or synthetic sapphire. Though plexiglass is tough, it is highly susceptible to scratches, while regular glass has a higher likelihood of breaking.
 
 
 
 Sports watches are usually durable and made of high quality plastic that makes them water resistant to a high degree, and scratch proof too. Sports watches also tend to have many additional features like altimeters, compasses and the like.
 
 
 
 When buying a watch, make sure that it fits snugly on your wrist. It shouldn’t be so tight that it leaves an imprint. If your watch is silver, it will go well with clothes in hues of black, grey, silvers and blues. Gold watches go great with warm tones like beige, tan, browns and so on. Digital watches look best with casual clothing. There is a wealth of information about the intricacies of watches like its aperture, chronograph, complication, gasket and so on. That’s why you need to make an educated choice. There’s no sense to buy a watch on an impulse and then discover that it doesn’t go with more than half your wardrobe.
 
 
 
 
 
 -Take a good look at the contents of your wardrobe and then to fix a budget
 -Next, ask yourself for which occasions will you be wearing the watch – to work, on occasions when you are going out or while playing sports? Pick a watch to match the same
 -Decide if you are looking for a basic watch or one with several fancy, high-tech features. It’s good to be clear about your choice before entering a shop
 -Unless you are very sure of the watch and how it looks on you, don’t shop online. Or check it out physically and then order online!
