LUCKNOW: City continued to reel under heat wave as   temperatures rose above 40 degrees Celsius for the second consecutive day on Friday. No relief is likely on Saturday and Sunday. Temperatures, however, are expected to come back to normal levels by Monday-Tuesday.

 The maximum   on Friday was 41 degrees Celsius, six degrees above normal, second hottest day in the month of March in the past 15 years. It was almost at par with 41.1 degrees Celsius, recorded on Thursday. Night was hot too with minimum temperature 20.3 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. 
 
 On Saturday, the sky would be mainly clear with maximum and minimum temperatures around 41 and 20 degrees Celsius, respectively.
 
 State Met director J P Gupta said western disturbance (WD) over hills has cut off the flow of cold wind towards the plains, resulting in rise in temperatures. Bright sunshine is adding to the heat. The WD is expected to fizzle out by Sunday-Monday. Thereafter, temperatures will come back to normal levels. 
 
 Another WD is expected on Tuesday which is expected to cause some rainfall in the plains, including in northwest UP. Cloudy sky is expected in Lucknow on Wednesday.
