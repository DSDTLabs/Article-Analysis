Panaji: While prices of onions and tomatoes have become pocket-friendly, vendors are worried about damage to   owing to the heavy showers that have lashed the state over the last few days.

 Onions are now available for Rs 30 per kg and tomatoes are selling at Rs 25 per kg as opposed to the whopping Rs 70 per kg they were sold for in August. Some vendors said the fruit’s rate could even come down to Rs 20 in an effort to push sales.
 
 “There has been a good yield of crops, particularly tomatoes, in the neighbouring states this harvest period. Our suppliers from Belagavi, Kolhapur and Nipani are therefore giving us a good rate owing to which we have been able to lower prices in Goa,” said Hyder Ali, a vendor at the Panaji municipal market.
 
 Sellers, however, are concerned about the shelf life of their vegetables.
 
 “The new harvest is more prone to rotting because it is still moist. The rain has got us concerned about the shelf life following delivery to Goa,” wholesale vegetable supplier from Belagavi, Sree Nath, told TOI via the phone.
 
 “When vegetables get wet in the rain on their way to the state, we have to bear the brunt. All the more since the moisture level in Goa is high due to the heavy rain these days. We are thus forced to push the tomato sales faster in order to clear our shelves,” said Jafar Mokashi, another vendor at the Panaji market
