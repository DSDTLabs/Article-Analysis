NASHIK: The district deputy election officer has come up with   for   who ensure significant registration of   voters in the electoral rolls.

 The department’s move comes in the wake of the   (ECI) instructions to take measures to increase the number of women voters.
 
 “We are taking all measures prescribed by the ECI to ensure that names of all eligible   are in the voters list. We have announced a cash prize of Rs 5,000, Rs 3,000 and Rs 2,000 for booth-level officers (BLO) who ensure maximum registrations. There are also consolation prizes,” Pradnya Bade-Misal the deputy district election officer, said. 
 
 She added that employees and office branches have been instructed to approach women at gatherings and public events for enrolment in the voters’ list.
 
 “Booth-level officers have been instructed to survey and find women whose names are missing from the voters list. They will be helped in completing formalities so that they are included in the electoral rolls. Only fresh registrations will be eligible for the contest among the BLOs. The performance will be gauged on the percentage of women registering and not the absolute count,” Misal said.
 
 With the   polls round the corner, the Malegaon additional collectorate has organised the voters’ literacy programme for women electors. Malegaon additional collector Dileep Swami held demonstrations of the electronic voting machine (EVM) on how votes are to be cast in the polls and how the counting is done.
