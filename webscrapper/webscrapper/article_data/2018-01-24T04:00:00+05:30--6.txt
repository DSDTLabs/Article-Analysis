Surat: One person was arrested and another yet to be nabbed by the police on the charges of alleged provocation with intent to cause riot in the city over release of movie ‘Padmaavat’ on Tuesday.

 Hitesh Vishwakarma, a resident of Dindoli, and Shivom Mishra, a resident of Ena village in Bardoli, were booked at Umra police station on Monday under the Indian Penal Code Section 153. Vishwakarma was arrested, while Mishra could not be found at the place where he used to stay. Vishwakarma is secretary of Surat chapter of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Yuva Morcha and Mishra is its president.
 
 The accused duo held a press conference in the Circuit House on January 20 and had threatened to torch cinema halls if they screened Padmaavat movie. They displayed a bottle of petrol and stones at the press conference. The video went viral on social media leaving the state government embarrassed because the press conference had been held at the government premises.
 
 At least 54 people have been so far arrested by the police in five cases of unlawful assembly registered in the city. Police are taking strict action against office-bearers of all those organizations which were involved in violence.
 
 Meanwhile, Rajput Karni Sena sought permission from the police on Tuesday to sit on a dharna near Mahatma Gandhi statue in Chowk in protest against the controversial Hindi movie. The group wanted to stage a sit-in from Tuesday until January 30 but is yet to be granted permission. 
 
 “We will allow the group to hold a peaceful dharna. Its members are yet to complete certain formalities before we give them permission,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said.
