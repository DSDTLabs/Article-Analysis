  "It is going to be quite a chic flick, with everyone trying to make it to my wedding. It's a stylish and fun journey," Bebo told Mirror during an interview.

 Sumeet will be seen as Bebo's love interest and the actress admits that she will be meeting him for the first time during the first narration of the film. "Rhea's got a solid plan. I'll meet Sumeet soon and everyone's excited about starting shoot," Kareena said.
 
 Meanwhile, Sumeet's kicked about the pairing too and says that his sister has been treating him 'extra-nicely' ever since he signed the film. "My mileage with my family has shot up too because they are all big fans of Kareena. It's hard to contain all the excitement," he smiles.
 
 Sumeet, who has known Swara and Shikha since his early days as an actor, is quick to point out that even though it is a film about female-bonding, he has a 'meaty and badmaash role'.
 
 "My character brings a sense of humour to the plot. Shashanka made it clear that it wasn't just a male part thrown into the picture. He wanted a solid actor on board. But I'm not being delusional, I know it's a film about four girls with a mind-blowing script!" he signs off.
