Trichy: About 95% of the new two-lane bridge being built across Koraiyar River on Chennai-Trichy-Dindigul Road has been completed, said the state highways department. With the works on installing handrails only pending, the highways department officials said that the new bridge across Koraiyar near Karumandapam will be opened for public by the end of this month.

 The State Highways (SHU 154) road maintained by Trichy highways division starting from Aristo Roundabout and passing through Ponnagar, Karumandapam, Dheeran Nagar, and Ramji Nagar has been facing congestion while approaching the existing two-lane bridge across Koraiyar River. While the SHU 154 road stretch was four lanes with a centre median, the existing bridge across Koraiyar is two-lane only. To overcome the mismatch, a proposal was suggested by the highways department to construct a new two-lane bridvge across the river parallel to the existing bridge at an estimated cost of Rs 5.39 crore. "About 95% of the structural works in the two-lane bridge started in March 2016 were completed. Remaining works such as laying approach roads will be completed by April 2018," R Krishnasami, divisional engineer, state highways, said.
 
 Cauvery Bridge
 
 At an estimated cost of Rs 35 lakh, the ongoing renovation works on the iconic Cauvery bridge are expected to be finished by May 2018, said the highways department officials. "Demolishing the existing solid brick walls bordering the bridge is underway. A new contractor was assigned to build the retaining walls with openings," an official said. Pedestrian platforms will also see an overhaul. The highways department acknowledged that the previous solid retaining wall was a design failure.
