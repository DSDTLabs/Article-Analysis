LUCKNOW:   (SP) national president   on Monday held the Modi government at Centre and Yogi government in the state responsible for the increasing pollution of rivers in UP. 

 Akhilesh took a dig at Prime Minister   by recalling his statement during 2014 Lok Sabha polls electioneering that he was contesting from Varanasi because 'Maa Ganga' has invited him.
 
 "The term of Prime Minister, who had announced that he had come to Varanasi on invitation of Maa Ganga, is about to end, but the holy river is still as polluted as it was before. The Ganga is full of water hyacinth and the pollution in Yamuna in Delhi is so much that its water has turned black. The condition of Hindon is almost the same," Akhilesh said in Lucknow on Monday.
 
 Attacking chief minister   for the neglect of Gomti riverfront, Akhilesh said that SP government had spent resources on beautification of the riverfront which became a major attraction for people of Lucknow. "But the BJP government seems to have taken a vow to destroy all the projects that were started during Samajwadi Party regime," he said while adding that the trees along the riverfront have dried up and imported fountains that were installed were lying defunct because of poor upkeep.
 
 "Water hyacinth has covered a major portion of the Gomti and about a dozen drains that open into the river are adding to the pollution which is already alarmingly high, but the government is looking the other way," Akhilesh said.
