It’s ‘all work and no play’ for actors on television when they are shooting for a daily soap. It’s only when their show comes to an end that they get time to socialise, indulge themselves or pursue their interests. However, unlike his contemporaries,   decided to sharpen his acting skills after his TV show ' ' went off-air. “I am a greedy actor and want to better myself with every project,” he says, adding, “I always have this fear that I won’t be able to do justice to my role, be it comedy, mythological or a performance-oriented role. So, to overcome those fears, I joined an acting class. It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there. If you don’t keep learning, you’ll fall behind.”
Ask him about his dream role, and Namish replies, “An out-and-out romantic role would be like a cherry on the cake. Nevertheless, I am open to doing any kind of role.”
