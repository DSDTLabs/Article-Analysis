THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Rajesh, the   a day ago for swindling money and   of  , lived a life that was completely in contrast to the public perception about a priest. 

 “Rajesh gained a little bit of knowledge about temple rituals by assisting other priests in the temples in his village near Cherthala. There are numerous small temples across the state where priests often leave there jobs as they are paid less. Rajesh targeted such temples and secured jobs there. He would never work for more than two months in a temple,” said Thumba sub-inspector  , who arrested him.
 
 At   temple, he barely worked for a month. By this time, he not only gained trust of several devotees and duped them, but also lured the wife of the assistant priest into a relationship. She left her husband and three-year-old son for Rajesh. The woman, Athira, has also been booked as the second accused in the case for helping Rajesh to mortgage the gold ornaments collected from the devotees. 
 
 Rajesh too was a philanderer by nature. Around six years ago, he left his wife and two children. He was living in with another woman prior to coming to Thumba. The woman is currently pregnant. 
 
 The police have seized as many as 12 receipts of mortgaging gold ornaments at various finance firms. They have managed to recover around five sovereigns of ornaments. Nearly 10 sovereigns of ornaments are yet to be recovered, the police said. 
 
 Rajesh is also alleged to have duped over Rs 50,000 from several devotees, including the complainant Girija, from whom he swindled Rs 30,000. 
 
 After he was arrested the Thumba police have received seven more complaints against him. He is currently under judicial custody and the police would file a custody application for him on Friday before the court.
