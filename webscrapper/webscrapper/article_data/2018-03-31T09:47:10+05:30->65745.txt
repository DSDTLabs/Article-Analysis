HYDERABAD: The recent   judgment that no trial should be stalled beyond six months on account of the stay orders obtained by the accused from higher courts is likely to impact several ongoing cases, particularly the ones booked under the provisions of prevention of corruption Act in   and Telangana.

 The proceedings before the trial court in   scam case almost came to a standstill on account of the HC stay on further proceedings in respect of key accused   and Emaar-MGFâ€™s MD   for the last two years. Similarly, in the YS Jaganmohan Reddy disproportionate assets case, several accused in as many as eight charge sheets have approached HC challenging the charge sheets filed against them by the  . The high court granted them relief. The trial proceedings in respect of these eight charge sheets have been impacted to some extent.
 
 Now, legal analysts say that though there will not be any immediate impact of the Supreme Court judgment on these cases, it will certainly start showing its impact after passage of six months from now. That is because the Supreme Court gave a blanket order that vacates all interim orders obtained by the accused after six months from now. The trial court can then commence its proceedings even in respect of those accused who obtained stay orders.
 
 Since the Supreme Court said that the accused have to get fresh speaking orders from the courts to get the stay extended, it can be safely presumed that within six months from now the trial in all the charge sheets in   and Emaar cases will get fresh impetus, the analysts said. The days of deemed extension of HC relief are over, they said.
