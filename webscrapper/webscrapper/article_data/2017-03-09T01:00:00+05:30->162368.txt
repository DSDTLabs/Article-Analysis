  Though he was reluctant to interact with the media, Steve revealed that he had met Stephen a few years back in  . Stephen was closely associated with ISKCON ( International Society Of Krishna Consciousness ) and had wished that his ashes be immersed in the Ganga in Varanasi.
 
  Steve, who performed the ritual for about half an hour, later went for a boat ride across the river. He was fascinated with the graffiti on the walls on the ghat and even took photos of them. He also explored a bit of the city through the lanes near the ghat.

  While our sources in Varanasi say that the last rites were for Steve's friend Stephen, some Australian and other media reports say that it was for Brian Rudd, a shoe shiner from Sydney.
