LUCKNOW: In a major embarrassment for the ruling  , Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya on Tuesday slammed the party’s Aligarh MP, Satish Gautam, for questioning the Aligarh Muslim University for displaying a photograph of Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali   in the institute. 

 
 Calling Jinnah a ‘mahapurush’ who contributed for India before Pakistan was formed, Maurya told reporters, “Jin bhi mahapurushon ka yogdaan is rashtra ke nirmaan mein raha hai yadi un par koi ungli uthaata hai to bahut ghatiya baat hai... (It is shameful for anyone to point a finger on great leaders who contributed towards formation of the country).” Gautam had earlier written a letter to AMU vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor seeking an explanation for displaying Jinnah’s photo. “What is the compulsion of putting his picture,” he had asked. 
 
 Gautam said though he didn’t know where the photo was displayed, the question was why it was there at all, because after India’s Partition, there was no justification for displaying the photo of Pakistan’s founder. This is not the first time Maurya has left BJP red-faced. A few days ago, he hailed BSP chief   for maintaining a robust law and order situation during her regime.
