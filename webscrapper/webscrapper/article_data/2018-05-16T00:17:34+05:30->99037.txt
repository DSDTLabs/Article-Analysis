Vijayawada: The All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) and the state government are working on a proposal of introducing ‘3+3   courses’ for the   students. A six-year course for the students who passed the class X exams with two-and-a-half year diploma course, two-and-a-half years of degree course and a year of industrial training.

 According to Panda Das, commissioner at Department of Technical Education, the   will be implemented at five places in the state in all engineering branches as a pilot programme. 
 
 “There is a gap between the traditional engineering courses and the industry requirement, and the AICTE has been making reforms to bring out skilled manpower ready for industries and this program is one such initiatives,” said Panda Das. The colleges have been focussing mainly on the theory part, and AICTE has been making changes to the curriculum and removing all the portion that is not relevant to the skills required by the industries.
 
 About 1,500 students will be able to register for the courses beginning from the next academic year with 60 students in each branch. The courses will be available in five branches at five places in the state. The syllabus is also being designed for the proposed project. Upon the completion of class X, the students can do the diploma course for two-and-a-half years and then take an internship program for one year. The internship program is called the sandwich course, as it is followed by the degree courses and preceded by the diploma course.
 
 The students will gain industry exposure and then get into the degree course. The students can exit the program after the diploma course if they do not want to continue with the internship and degree courses, Das said. 
 
 This way the students will have no insecurity after their 10 class, he added. The students will have many opportunities on the completion of the six-year course with the salaries ranging from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000, he further added.
