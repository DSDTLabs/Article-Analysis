SHIMLA: Hamirpur MP of   Anurag Thakur has accused chief minister Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government in   of failing to start the construction of Central University at Dehra in Kangra district even after the Union ministry of environment and forests had given environmental clearance for the land acquired.

 Thakur claimed this situation would not have arisen had Virbhadra started the construction at Dehra, which was endorsed by him too within two weeks of taking over as the chief minister. He said substantial construction of the university could have been completed in last four years and moved to its permanent campus had Virbhadra been serious about the same. “This only shows apathy and ignorance of Virbhadra-led government towards Central University,” he added.
 
 The MP said the site for construction of the university was approved during UPA regime, even then the Virbhadra-led government has resorted to delaying tactics and pitted people of same district against each other. He said that in the interest of the people of Kangra, the CM should stop politics and allow construction to start at the already finalized site at Dehra.
 
 Before each election in state, Central University becomes a major issue in Kangra as the BJP is demanding to set up campus at Dehra while Congress is favouring campus near  . In 2007, Central University was allotted to Himachal along with 15 other states. While substantial progress has been made in other states in construction of campuses and most of them have started functioning, in HP it is still forced to function from rented premises even after 10 years of its establishment.
