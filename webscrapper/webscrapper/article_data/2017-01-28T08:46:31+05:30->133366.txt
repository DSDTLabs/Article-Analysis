THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Enquiry commissioner and special judge (vigilance)   here on Friday slammed the government for allowing corrupt officials to continue in service, disregarding the vigilance recommendations against them. The judge raised the criticism while considering a petition against chief secretary   alleging that he delayed action on files against senior officers.
The judge was referring to the case of additional chief secretary (labour)  , who continues to be in service despite facing probe in two cases registered by the   (VACB). One case pertained to amassment of wealth disproportionate to known source of income and alleged corruption involved in the purchase of magnesium when he was the chief of Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd.
 
 Court had earlier directed VACB to produce files relevant to these cases as one of the main allegation by the petitioner was that Vijayanand was deliberately delaying action against Tom Jose, who had allegedly committed corruption in tune of several crores, despite the vigilance submitting arecommendation to suspend him from service.
 
 The court reportedly asked why such corrupt officials were allowed to continue in service. The government should give a clarification in this regard. The vigilance court further stated that suppressing files against senior officers by the chief secretary and allowing them to continue in service would send wrong messages about the government.
 
 The court has posted the case again to February 6 for further hearing.
