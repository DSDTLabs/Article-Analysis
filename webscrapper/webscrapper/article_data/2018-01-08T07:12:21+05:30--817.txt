The citizens can now use hygienic and clean public toilets as the city will get its first Eco   or   next week. This will also be the first etoilet in Uttar Pradesh.

 The spic and span e-toilet, equipped with automatic water spray system, has been built near the modern bus shelter on   opposite   office. It is likely to be inaugurated next week.
 
 LMC has sent a request to the urban development department for approval of inauguration of the e-toilet by January 10.
 
 
  
 
 The toilet will be ecofriendly too as only 200 litres water every month is needed for it against 40,000 litres water in a conventional toilet. The water is recycled after every use to be used for flush. The entire structure is made up of stainless steel which is sturdy and automatically cleans after every use.
 
 The in charge of   project said, “The floor of the e-toilet has pores all across its surface which drains out all water. Since jets are installed across the floor length, as soon as one closes the door, the jets sprinkle water which cleans the seat and entire floor. This way every user gets fresh and clean toilet.”
 
 Users will have to take a radio frequency identification (RDI) card from the attendant of the toilet by paying Rs 5. On punching the card, the door will open and will close automatically after the user exits. It will re-open only when the   card is swiped again.
 
 The e-toilet on Ashok Marg will be the first prototype of the Smart Green Toilet.
 
 Under the Smart City project, Lucknow Municipal Corporation plans to install 200 e-toilets which will have one cubicle each for men and women. The toilets are to be built by 2020 end.
 
 Each e-toilet will cost Rs 5.5 lakh and will be built next to all modern bus shelters.
