Kolkata: In a clear indication it will keep up heat on BJP in the Parliament session starting Monday,   said if BJP was eyeing the east, they (Trinamool) were eyeing Lal Qila.

 Trinamool leader Derek O’Brien said: “Let the BJP propaganda not cloud analysis. The ruling party is eyeing the east, we are eyeing Lal Qila. On August 15, 2019, Narendra Modi will not address this nation from the ramparts of Red Fort.”
 
 “Let us put things in perspective,” he added. “Tripura has 25 lakh voters. The smallest of Bengal’s 23 districts is Howrah, which has 30 lakh voters. Tripura represents two seats in the Lok Sabha; there are 543 more in play. Before that, the second stage of the Budget session of Parliament begins on Monday. The BJP still has to answer serious questions.”
 
 Trinamool’s reactions came in the wake of an elated BJP asserting the Tripura waves were already lashing Bengal’s shores. At a public rally in South 24 Parganas’ Amtola, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said it was BJP that could uproot Trinamool from Bengal. “When some BJP supporters were killed in Tripura, people changed the mandate in that state. In Bengal, many more of our supporters have been killed and injured, and their properties destroyed. BJP will bring a similar change in this state.”
