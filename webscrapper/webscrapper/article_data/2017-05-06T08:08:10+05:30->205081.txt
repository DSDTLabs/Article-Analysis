CHENNAI: Why arrest and jail   who were trying to prevent hurried relocation of closed liquor outlets and bars across the state, asked   on Friday. 

 A vacation bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice V Parthiban, also quashed an FIR registered against a ground of 21 people belonging to Naam Tamizhar Katchi, paving the way for their immediate release from jail.
 
 Making the home secretary, director-general of police, Chennai city commissioner of police and the TASMAC top brass as parties to the case, the court directed them to furnish the details such as the number of agitations, violence, lathicharge, number of people arrested and injuries in police action before June 12 when the matter would be taken up for further hearing.
 
 "In view of the nuisance being created by drunkards, others are worried and they stage demonstration. No doubt demonstration should be staged without any violence. The only violence which is alleged to have been commissioned by the petitioners is bringing down the flex board and it being set on fire. It is very difficult to assess the mood of the masses and this kind of things cannot be avoided when an agitation is staged," the judges said.
 
 Clarifying that the observation does not mean that the court was encouraging any violence, the judges said, "any form of violence should be discouraged and deprecated." It asked the petitioners to pay 1,000 the   State Legal Services Authority, as cost for setting fire to flex board. 
 
 In view of the large number of agitations taking place in the state, involving women and children, the bench said it would frame more guidelines on handling such protests.
