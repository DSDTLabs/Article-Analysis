 star Actor   has decided to stay away from the limelight as she wants to have a normal life.

 The actor, who is seen as Alex on the show feels that the entertainment industry is a tough place to be in and to keep her sanity intact she stays out of the spotlight "as much as possible", as per a report.
 
 "One day you did something great, and the next day you're like plastered as a thousand other things. It's a really difficult industry. I mean, we're blessed to be in it, and be able to make content that we love and that other people love, but it's also an industry. It is true. it builds you up, and it can tear you down just as fast.
 
 "Having every little aspect of your life in the public eye, it's really hard, because it gives more room for criticism, and I just want to live. So I think I try and stay out of it as much as possible, unless I need to be in it. I don't really go anywhere to be seen or anything like that. I'll go to a red carpet, if I'm in (the movie), or if I'm supporting my boyfriend (Levi Meaden)or my friends. But otherwise I usually just stay home," Winter said.
