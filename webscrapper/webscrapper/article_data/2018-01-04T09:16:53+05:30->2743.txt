PANAJI:   were forced to spend almost the entire day at the home airport and took off for their   encounter against   just 90 minutes before scheduled kickoff at the   in Kolkata on Wednesday.

 FC Goa were originally scheduled to depart for Kolkata by a chartered flight on Tuesday morning but after two delays, when the flight finally took off, it had to make an emergency landing in Goa due to technical issues. The club then decided to charter another flight to Kolkata on matchday itself but when the team boarded the flight at 10am and were ready for take-off, they were told there are "technical issues" that still needed to be sorted out.
 
 FC Goa waited for their moment at the airport itself but then their schedule was further disrupted after a MiG 29K combat aircraft of the   caught fire after it veered off the runway at the airport. The incident led to operations at the Goa airport being suspended for close to two hours, leading to more delays.
 
 When their chartered flight finally took off at 6.30pm, nobody really knew if they would make it for the match on time. An hour's delay was already made official by the league but FC Goa landed in Kolkata only at 9.05pm.   organisers first decided to start the match at 9.45pm as the club had not reached Kolkata by 9pm. ISL rules stipulate that matches can be delayed for a maximum of two hours, but Goa's plight meant ATK were considerate enough to agree to further delays. The game finally started at 10.45pm.
