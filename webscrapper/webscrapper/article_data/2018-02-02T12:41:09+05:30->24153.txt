NEW DELHI: The   today agreed to hear plea of   challenging Centre's decision to introduce electoral bond in elections.

 A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanvilkar and DY Chandrachud agreed to examine the plea of the political party challenging government's decision.
 
 Earlier, CPM had approached the Supreme Court challenging the Centre's decision to introduce electoral bonds arguing that the move "undermined democracy" and it would "lead to greater political corruption".
 
 Claiming that the scheme would clean up political funding, the   government had announced electoral bonds in the previous budget. It met with stiff resistance from opposition parties and initial reservations from the Election Commission.
 
 CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury argued that the government's decision to introduce electoral bonds is "bad for democracy" and said that CPM was left with no choice but to move the SC. 
 
 "We took up the matter in Parliament and sought amendments to the bill when the government moved the proposal. Using their majority in LS, the government overturned the RS's recommendations. The no disclosure clause in electoral bonds will create opacity in funding and is bad for democracy," he said.
