CHENNAI: The   faction led by former chief minister O   on Tuesday replied to Election Commission on the answers given by V K   on her appointment as party general secretary. This follows EC asking the   group to send its reply on or before March 14. 

 Panneerselvam will meet   Dr Nasim Zaidi in Delhi around noon on Wednesday and explain in person the issues under which Sasikala was appointed as the general secretary of the AIADMK.
 
 “We have presented our replies to the EC, in 61 pages. We have rebutted each and every answer given by Sasikala to the EC challenging a petition given by us. We have also enclosed proper supporting evidences for our answers. We have replied to the EC in the form of an affidavit, and we are not in a position to give all the information presented to the EC,” AIADMK Rajya Sabha member V Maithreyan told TOI over the phone from New Delhi.
 
 The EC asked the OPS group to give its reply after Sasikala, through two advocates, gave her reply to the EC on March 10. Earlier, the EC returned the reply given by party deputy general secretary TTV Dinakaran stating that the EC did not know him at all.
 
 Panneerselvam and others will leave for New Delhi on Tuesday evening. “Apart from Panneerselvam, the group will have former ministers K P Munuswamy, Natham Viswanathan, K Pandiarajanm; MLAs and MPs,” said a senior leader of the group.
