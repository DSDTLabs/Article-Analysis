MYSURU: Ahead of the arrival of Shaurya (in picture), an Asiatic lion from Gujarat,   authorities are bracing to breed   in captivity, probably for the first time. 

 Though the zoo has bred Afro-Asiatic and European lions sometime ago, it has not bred Asiatic lion in its 125-year history. The last time it bred lion, an Afro-Asiatic breed, was five years ago. But the cub was to be hand-reared after its mother abandoned it and died seven months later. The officials are now hoping to breed two-and-year-old Asiatic lion Shaurya.
 
 Zoo executive director K Kamala said that to breed pure Asiatic lion at Mysuru Zoo, they are exchanging animals with Rajkot Zoo for Shaurya. “We will pair Shaurya with Renitha, also procured from Sakkarbaug Zoo in Gujarat. Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has given its clearance for the exchange, and Shaurya is expected to arrive at Mysuru Zoo by February-end or early March. It will help the zoo authorities breed Asiatic lion in captivity,” she added.
 
 A former employee claimed that Mysuru Zoo has been displaying European and African lions for the past five decades, and also has bred these two breeds successfully. The cubs were given to other zoos, circus companies and Bannerghatta park. 
 
 “This apart, we are also getting a lion-tailed macaque (LTM) from Chennai Zoo for the breeding purpose. Recently, the zoo lost one breeding macaque.
 
 Anacondas, Himalayan bear
 
 Along with an LTM and a lion, CZA has given clearance to get six green anacondas from Sri Lankan Zoo. A few years ago, the zoo had brought four-five anacondas, but some of them died due to a change in temperature. Anacondas are expected to arrive at the facility early in March.
 
 Meanwhile, Shillong Zoo in Meghalaya is gifting a Himalayan bear to Mysuru Zoo, while Surat Zoo is ready to spare two male otters in exchange to black swans and an Indian guar. CZA approval is awaited for the exchange.
