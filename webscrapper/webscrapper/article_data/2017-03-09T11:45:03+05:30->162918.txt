MADURAI:  , a town panchayat in   district is all set to declare itself as   by the end of this month. A   in the area has now become a major attraction where animal figures have been made out of recycled vehicle tyres, which otherwise could become environmental hazards. 

 The executive officer of Chinnalapatti, P Ganeshan, said that, they had started implementing solid waste management in the 10,000 households, who segregated their waste at home before handing it over to the garbage collecting staff. 
 
 As the wet waste was segregated at the source, this town panchayat was able to produce 30 tonnes of manure and one tonne of vermicompost every month, in their composting yard.
 
 "We wanted to send the important message to people that if waste is segregated properly, it can be reused or recycled. As we did not want them to ignore our recycle yard, we have placed figures of animals such as peacocks, gorillas and eagles, as an attraction. A craftsman from Kancheepuram district helped us make the figures, predominantly made out of vehicle tyres.'' Ganeshan said.
 
 With the cooperation of the public and also the sanitary workers, who take utmost care in segregating waste, this town was able to strive towards a plastic-free environment.
 
 In order to tackle the problem meat stall wastes dumped on the side of roads and in drains, the town panchayat started collecting them from the shops and used it to feed fish at the town farm. The fish farm now brings the local body annual revenue to 25000 to 35000. 
 
 S Parvathy of   said that, they have been provided with two buckets, in which they deposit the dry and wet waste separately. 
 
 "Our town panchayat has become a much cleaner place now,'' she added.
