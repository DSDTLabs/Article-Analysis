RANCHI: Women in the city will now have a safe place to hangout where they can relax and have fun without any security threats. Youth Accomodation Centre cafe, the brainchild of  , a young entrepreneur, is the first all-girls café in the city which has been opened recently at   near Lalpur. 

 Kumar said, “Peace road is an area which has numerous girls’ hostels but the security here is a bit lax, leaving the girls no place to hang around. This was the major reason why I came up with the idea.”
 
 At present, only the food counter has been opened which has a platter of snacks ranging from vada pao, Maggie, chowmein, sandwiches to tea/coffee and others, all ranging from Rs 20 to Rs100.
 
 But there are also plans to start a common room for indoor games and a reading section within a month. “We will have games like carom, chess, scrabbles and a separate reading area for girls where they will be provided free novels and comics to read,” Kumar said.
 
 Talking about the security measures, Arpit said security guards will be appointed round-the-clock and there would also be two senior wardens to monitor the area.
 
 He said, “I have lived in a hostel myself, for more than 10 years and I know the kind of problems students face. While boys can still hang out with friends anywhere, girls usually have safety concerns. So I decided to come up with something exclusively meant for female students.”
 
 Kumar said that if the café becomes a hit among girls, he will also start personality development classes for girls very soon. “When students leave their home town and visit a metropolitan city for the first time, they are completely clueless. These classes would brace them for the challenges they might face there and also prepare them to cope with it,” he said.
