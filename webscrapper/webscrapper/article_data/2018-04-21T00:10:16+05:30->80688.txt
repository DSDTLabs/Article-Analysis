Chennai: The police have begun investigating a complaint that goods worth at least Rs 2.75 crore have been missing from a godown at the Vallur thermal   in Athipattu near Minjur in North Chennai.

 Mallikarjuna, the godown manager at the plant, had lodged a complaint in the matter with the Minjur police in February and a case was registered, but the investigation took a back seat as the officers concerned immersed themselves in more important cases, a source said.
 
 After Rajkumar took over as inspector at the Minjur police station recently, he reviewed pending cases and ordered a probe into the suspected theft at the Vallur plant, the source said. “It is surprising that such a huge quantity of material has suddenly disappeared from the thermal power plant that is monitored by a large team of Central Industrial Security Force personnel,” said a police officer. The police said they suspect the handiwork of an insider as the huge quantity of material could not have been transported out without inside help.
 
 The thermal plant, which produces 1,500MW, has large godown where large pieces of equipment including boilers, conveyor belts and fans are stored. Given the constant use of the machinery, a lot of it wears out fast and has tobe repalced frequently, said a source at the plant.
