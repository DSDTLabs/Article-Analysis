Temples — considered the birthplace of Hindu culture — are also places for various arts forms. These forms, which began in temples, entered the courts of emperors and kings, and later reached the general public. In 1947, however, the SITA act prevented women from performing in temples and courts of emperors and kings, which led to a diminishing interest in them. That resulted in men taking over the women’s roles while performing Andhra Natyam, which is counted among the country’s ancient art forms.
Brukumsa, a classical   which focuses on woman impersonation, was recently hosted in the city. The aim of the festival was to revive Andhra Natyam. Three artistes —  , Surya Rao and   — were the main performers of the   dance festival. When   asked them why they decided to take up this particular ballad, Surya, said, “During the British rule, there was the anti-nautch movement and women weren’t allowed to dance. So, male dancers had to dress up as women and had to enact in some of the traditional formats of Kuchipudi. This is not in practice these days, so we took it up as a challenge to revive this art form, and have tried to perform the way artistes did in its heyday.”
 Any type of traditional dance can become everlasting with the admiration and support of the general public. So, when it comes to gauging the audience’s reaction to the dance festival, Kalakrishna observes, “The audience reaction was good, since there were many art lovers in attendance; this included several artistes.” Those who attended the performance included dancers Satyanarayana Raju and Prathama Prasad, among others.
