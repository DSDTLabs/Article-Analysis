Coimbatore: The city lakes will finally get a makeover at an estimated cost of Rs 88cr under the smart city project. Three quick win projects that have been sanctioned are the Valankulam promenade, Valankulam under bridge makeover and a promenade at Ukkadam lake. The projects are the first to be taken up under the smart city. The state government has already given administrative sanction for them. “Once we get the technical sanction, we will call for tenders and begin the work within a month,” city corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan told TOI. The New Delhi-based consultant had envisaged development of parks, a multi-purpose space for skating, dance, aerobics, clay modelling and a skill development centre to improve employment opportunities for the urban poor at a space overlooking the lake under the flyover near Valankulam lake. For the promenade at Valankulam, the consultant plans to make it a pedestrian-safe street by introducing pedestrian crossings. The design also aims to create an entrance plaza and spaces for vendors, public conveniences and food kiosks to make it a place for people to enjoy. A visual element, which will be prominent and visible at night from top of the Valankulam Flyover will also be set up. At Ukkadam lake, the Perur Byepass Road, which is an important road, will be redesigned for pedestrian safety in such a way that the lake side is visible from the road. Green infrastructure elements will be set up and the promenade will be set up so that people can enjoy the lake-view. The roads leading to the lake will also be designed in such a way that they are connected to the promenade. Both the Valankulam and Ukkadam promenades will be non-motorised corridors. “We will use natural methods to treat sewage before water is allowed into the lakes. Also, other infrastructure will be set up to dispose garbage and sewage entering the lake so that the water remains clean,” Vijayakarthikeyan added.
