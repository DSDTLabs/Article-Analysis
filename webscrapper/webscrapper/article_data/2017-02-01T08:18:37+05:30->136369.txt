KOCHI: The high court, on Tuesday, declined to order the removal of sheds put up by protestors near the campus of   at Thiruvananthapuram. A plea filed by the academy's principal P   was considered by the court. The court pointed out that it had already ordered police to ensure that there is no obstruction to enter and exit the campus on a petition seeking police protection. In these circumstances, there was no need to issue another order, the court said. 

 During the hearing, a counsel representing students' union submitted that the agitation is being conducted peacefully and that entry of students to the college is not being obstructed by agitators. 
 
 The college was closed after the protests started, the unions contended. In its petition, the academy management had alleged that sheds have been put up by agitators on both sides of the road leading to the campus from Peroorkada Junction. There are seven sheds on the road and BJP leader   was fasting in one of them, it was alleged.
