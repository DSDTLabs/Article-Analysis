In the race to land humans on  ,   is blowing the cobwebs off a technology it shelved in the 1970s — nuclear-powered rockets.

 Last year, Nasa partnered with  . for an $18.8 million contract to design a reactor and develop fuel for use in a nuclear-thermal propulsion engine for deep-space travel. While that small start is a long way from the the heady days of the Space Race of the Cold War, it marks the US return to an idea that is also being pursued by Russia and China. Unlike conventional rockets that burn fuel to create thrust, the atomic system uses the reactor to heat a propellant like liquid hydrogen, which then expands through a nozzle to power the craft.
 
 That doubles the efficiency at which the rocket uses fuel, allowing for a “drastically smaller” craft and shorter transit time, said  , a professor at Purdue University’s School of Aeronautics and Astronautics. “This factor is absolutely huge, especially for very difficult missions that necessitate a lot of propellant such as a Mars flight.”
 
 While the system would be a niche market in the global nuclear industry, it could be highly lucrative for the company that cracks the technology, especially for nations like the US, where the atomic energy sector has been in the doldrums for decades.
 
 “The application of BWXT capabilities for manufacturing systems for space applications is a modest but extremely important area of technical development,” said  , vice president for advanced technology programs at BWXT.
 
 Nasa faces competition in the race to Mars from industrialists like  , who have also vowed to get people to the red planet. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is testing an engine that uses liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas.
