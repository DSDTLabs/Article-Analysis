PANAJI: In a bid to make fresh fruits and vegetables widely available, the   (GSHCL) recently expanded its franchise through 43 new   outlets, besides a cashless mini-supermarket at Ganeshpuri, Mapusa.

 The air-conditioned outlets located at the secretariat, Panaji market, and the Altinho mini-supermarket already use PoS machines. 
 
 Besides regular fruits and vegetables, the outlet at Mapusa will also sell broccoli, lettuce, arugula etc. Exotic fruits like dragon fruit and bull’s heart will also be available. “We are already selling these fruits and vegetables at the mini-supermarket in Altinho. Depending on the response from consumers in Mapusa, we will decide on bringing in more such produce,” horticulture managing director,  , said.
 
 Following this venture, GSCHL will soon launch mini-supermarkets in Margao, Vasco, Ponda and Sanvordem.
 
 Eliminating the paycheck system, the corporation recently introduced e-payment transactions to farmers for the supply of fresh fruits and vegetables. This system will be soon introduced to GSHCL outlets through an app. Vendors will be connected with the horticulture corporation through the app, which will also serve as a payment gateway.
