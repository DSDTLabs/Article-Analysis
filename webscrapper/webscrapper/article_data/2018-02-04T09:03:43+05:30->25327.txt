AHMEDABAD: At a time when the two communities are locked in a bitter legal battle over construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in   where the   once stood,  , a Muslim in Ahmedabad, has undertaken renovation of a 500-year-old Hanuman temple. Ahmedabad is arguably one of the most communally polarized cities in the country.

 For the past two weeks, Memon, a 43-year-old builder, has devoted almost all his time at the site of ‘Bhid Bhanjan Hanuman’ temple in   area of the walled city of Ahmedabad. He personally oversees workers fixing saffron Italian tiles on the temple's facade.
 
 Memon has taken it on himself to shoulder all the expenses of the renovation work to restore the Hanuman temple to its original glory. Memon has steadfastly refused to divulge the cost involved in the good deed. He has received the temple priest  's blessings for his work.
 
 
 
 
 I have grown up seeing the temple in its vibrant glory. I offer namaz five times a day but as I passed by the temple, its dilapidated condition pained me. I contactedthe priest, RajeshBhatt, and offeredto renovateit. Hehappily agreed,” saidMemon. Bhatt, who has offered his services at the Hanuman temple for the past 30 years, said Memon had especially ordered saffron tiles from Italy for the temple's facade. “The restoration work will be over in a week's time. It is a shining example of communal goodwill and brotherhoodfor theentire country,” Rajesh Bhatt, the priest of the temple said. Vrajesh Mehta, priest of the adjoining ‘Shri Ek Lingji Mahadev’ temple, says ‘Hanuman Dada’ must have inspired Memon to renovate the temple withoutworrying aboutthe money.
 
 Mehta said the temple stands on the ancestral land of the family of Vinod Gaur of Maninagar. “Vinodbhai, an aged man, comes regularly to the temple. About50devotees visitthetempledaily. Hanuman Dada will now take care of Memon’s worries,” said Mehta.
