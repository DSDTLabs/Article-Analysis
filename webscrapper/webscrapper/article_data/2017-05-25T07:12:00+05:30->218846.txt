BATHINDA: The   administration on Wednesday locked the   of village Pakka ahead of the summer vacations starting from May 25. It has also ordered that the school would be re opened after the vacations in the presence of teachers and school management. 

 The functioning of the school has been affected by a tussle between teachers and management over salaries, retrenching teachers and engaging children in menial jobs. The school was being run under public private partnership( ) mode after the state government in 2016 entered into a partnership with Sukhsagar Avenue Welfare Association. School management chairman Narinder Singh was arrested on March 18 on charges of misappropriating salaries of 4 teachers and sexual harassment. 
 
 The teachers had approached the high court and those 7 who were asked not to report to school on May 18, sought court intervention for justice. The matter is pending. The district administration officials on Wednesday along with cops locked the school. 
 
 Faridkot deputy commissioner Rajiv Parashar said “There is a conflict between school teachers and the management. The case is already pending in the court and to avoid further controversy we locked the school, though teachers claim it was sealed. It will be opened in the presence of both the parties whenever it will be opened after the summer vacations.”
