NEW DELHI: Dubbing BJP MLA K G   as tainted and strictured by the Supreme Court for his conduct as speaker of the   in the past, Congress questioned his appointment as pro tem speaker to conduct the crucial trust vote in the state assembly on Saturday. 

  Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said Bopaiah, as assembly speaker between 2009 and 2013, had allegedly violated constitutional norms to save the previous   government, which faced graft charges then. 
 
  Bopaiah had disqualified 11 disgruntled BJP and five independent MLAs ahead of a trust vote to help the Yeddyurappa government in 2011. The decision was upheld by the Karnataka HC but overturned by the SC, which said the speaker had acted in haste. Congress released a copy of the SC judgement with strictures against Bopaiah. 
 
  "He is the same Bopaiah who had disqualified those BJP MLAs who had exposed Yeddyurappa's corruption... The SC bench had said he did not believe in the Constitution, democracy. The SC had dismissed his orders (as speaker) with stinging strictures," Surjewala said, asking how he could be put in the high position for the crucial vote. Congress lawyer Abhishek Singhvi said the convention was that the senior-most MLA was appointed pro tem speaker, which would mean party member R V Deshpande should get the post. 
 
  Congress general secretary Ashok Gehlot said despite the SC ruling against the Karnataka governor, the constitutional authority's attitude remained biased. "We sent a protest letter on the appointment of pro tem speaker to the governor but Raj Bhavan is not even accepting our mail. It shows that Raj Bhavan is still under pressure from the top BJP leadership. They want to kill democracy," he said. 
 
  Meanwhile, Singhvi said the SC order directing a trust vote had jolted BJP, evident in the fact that all its pleas - more time for voting, secret ballot, allowing policy decisions by the CM - were turned down by the bench.
