KOLKATA: Known for her aggressive batting,   won many a match with sparkling knocks studded with cracking square cuts and towering sixes. Almost 25 years after quitting first-class cricket, the former India opener played just as aggressively to hit cancer for a six. 

 
 After battling with the dreaded disease for a year, the 56-year was declared cancer free by doctors at the Tata Medical Centre, Mumbai, on January 26. "I was diagnosed with Endometrial carcinoma (cancer in the lining of the uterus) in February 2017. A frozen biopsy was done and it was confirmed to be a grade 2 stage 1 cancer,"   recalled.
 
 
 
  
  
 Rather than letting the scary news weigh her down, the brave Keya took up the 'challenge' by drawing inspiration from   - the braveheart who made a comeback to the Indian team after conquering cancer. "I knew I would fight this out. We all read about how   had battled cancerâ€¦ that gave me a lot of strength. I decided to undergo the surgery despite knowing it was critical," Keya said.
 
 The surgery was a success, with the doctors removing five of her organs. But then post-operative depression hit Keya. "It was tough for me to face the changes in my body," said Keya, currently a Bengal selector and the first to score a century in the National Women's Cricket Championship (in Gorakhpur, 1977).
