AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has deplored the practice of accusing entire families in cases of domestic violence and quashed one such complaint, filed by a woman to wreak vengeance on her in-laws, including a 90-year-old person.

  lodged an   under section 498A of IPC with Panigate police station in Vadodara in 2010, against 10 members of her matrimonial home — her husband Manish, his parents, sisters, brothers and brothers-in-law. She accused them of torturing her mentally and prompting her husband to remarry. She also filed a complaint against all of them for demanding dowry. Before this, she had sued them under the Domestic Violence Act.
 
 Of these 10 people, six approached the high court — two of Manish’s two sisters, their husbands and his parents. The court noticed that the sisters don’t live in Vadodara, but were dragged into the complaint. The court also felt that the accusations against the old parents were baseless.
 
 Quashing the case against them, Justice N V Anjaria said, “The tendency to rope in all the family members in the FIR speaks for itself and in such circumstances, the requirements of alleging a specific role for each of the members becomes necessary, for which an indispensable aspect is that all should live together.”
 
 The court also took into consideration that Chandrika’s cousin, who is married to Manish’s brother, also filed an FIR against these 10 members. “The FIR and the allegations therein turned out to be abuse of process of law and could be said to be only for wreaking vengeance,” the court said.
