NOIDA: The robbery motive in the   of   deputy general manager Amit Pandey became all the more feeble on Sunday after police found that no transaction had been done using his debit and credit cards that are  .

 Sources said that Pandey, who was found dead on Thursday afternoon with a gunshot wound in a woody stretch in Sector 105, did not carry much cash with him. His backpack, which contained some official documents, wallet having the credit and debit cards, and his phone are, however, missing.
 
 The police had first doubted the robbery angle after an expensive wrist watch Pandey was wearing was found intact.
 
 “He was known to keep three or four debit and credit cards. So far, there has been no transaction using them,” SP (city) Arun Kumar said.
 
 Police sources said bank transactions were among the first indicators of a robbery motive in any murder case. The police are now trying to examine the ties Pandey shared with his relatives. The BHEL official had been separated from his wife around 10 years ago and stayed with his brother and his family in Saphire Tower II.
 
 On Sunday, the police questioned Pandey’s brother-in-law and other relatives about his nature and habits. The police have sought one of Pandey’s laptops, which is in the house, and other belongings such as a diary to proceed with the investigation.
 
 “Another laptop is in the BHEL office. That, too, would be studied,” Singh said.
 
 Pandey’s colleagues, many of whom have taken to Twitter seeking a speedy probe, said they would extend all possible help to the police.
 
 “Our senior friend Amit Pandey working in BHEL at Industry sector, New Delhi is no more with us. Shot dead by gun at Sector-105 Noida main road. We want culprits to be punished,” tweeted Ved Prakash Meena, an   of BHEL.
