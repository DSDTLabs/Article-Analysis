 “This is snatching away of our fundamental rights. We gave the best years of our lives to the service of the country and we are still made to go from pillar to post at advanced ages, to fight for our rights,” said Col (retd) A K Mohey, an officer of Emergency Commission (EC) who now lives in  .
 
 Mohey helped former colleagues fighting in the Supreme Court and the principal CAT, to oppose the recovery demands and managed to get stays in two cases. He asked how can the government seek to recover the pension, against all logic.
