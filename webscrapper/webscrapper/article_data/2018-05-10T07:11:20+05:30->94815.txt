PORVORIM: The department of revenue is looking at measures to simplify and quicken the process for applying for partition and plans to include the partition process in the   to Time-Bound Delivery of Public Services Act, 2013.

 “As we think of ease of doing business, we are now looking at partition process,”   said. “The plan is that within the next two months, partition also becomes a part of right to time bound and implication of processes. The partition process will also be resolved within 90 days unless it is a very complicated issue.”
 
 
  
 
 The state government has already moved the process to seek mutation of land online and citizens can get their applications approved or rejected within 90 days under the simplified process. The revenue department now wants to simplify the partition and sanad process.
 
 One of the measures being explored by the revenue department is to see if the partition or conversion sanads of small plots of 250 sqm, 500 sqm and 800 sqm need clearance from the forest department.
 
 “Forest department clearance takes a long time. That is why, for technical clearance for plots in settlement area, we will link the database of the   department and revenue department to quicken the process,” Khaunte said.
 
 He added that the final decision would be taken after a discussion with chief minister  .
 
 The revenue department also discussed the possibility of moving the sanad application process online. 
 
 Khaunte has asked the revenue department officials to ensure that backend systems and application forms should be in place. “There will be workshops for deputy and additional collectors in the next 8-10 days for partition, conversion and regularization of illegal structures,” he said.
