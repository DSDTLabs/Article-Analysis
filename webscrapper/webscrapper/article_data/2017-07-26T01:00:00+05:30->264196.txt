Come August 15 and one can easily spot kids at traffic signals selling small paper flags. But have you ever seen someone selling a miniature tank before Kargil  ? You might spot it at the next traffic junction today, as the  's battle tanks seem to be the hottest topic in the capital these days. Recently, the   said that the campus premises should have a tank so that it constantly reminded students of the sacrifice by the defence forces. Looks like the 'traffic market' has capitalised on the occasion, as we spotted many selling miniature tanks at several traffic stops across NCR yesterday.

 You might spot sellers with small white tanks with stickers of the national flag on them. The sellers at a traffic junction in Sector 38 in Noida tell us that these tank toys, which were introduced in the 'traffic market' just two days before Kargil Diwas, are the latest addition to the August 15 merchandise. 
 
  A seller says, "Naya aaya hai market mein, Rs250 ka hai, Rs200 mein mil jayega. These toy tanks are being sold across NCR and are quite in demand." 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 Another seller adds, "When we sell anything at traffic spots, people don't even bother to look at us and we keep knocking at the car window. Aaj ek baar bhi aisa nahin hua ki maine sheeshe ke saamne yeh tank dikhaya ho aur gaadi ka sheesha neeche nahin hua ho." 
 
  The sellers tell us that commuters even stopped to have a look at the tank and even asked them for a demo. "Yeh chabi wali tank hai, isko aage peechhe bhi kar sakte hain."
