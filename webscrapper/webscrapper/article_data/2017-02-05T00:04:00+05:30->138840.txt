Navi Mumbai: The second edition of the annual Alibaug   race will be held from 7am to 5pm on Sunday. 

 Participating teams will have to travel to specific locations to watch and identify unusual birds during the race. 
 
 Sagar Mhatre, the organizer, said, “We hope that people, not just bird lovers, participate in the bird race and enjoy what the environment offers. Participants will be given specific locations where they can sight as many birds as possible. It’s a team event and the team which has the most number of bird sightings at the end of the day wins. Individuals are requested to form teams of four to five participants and include at least one seasoned birder in the group.” —Indira Rodericks
