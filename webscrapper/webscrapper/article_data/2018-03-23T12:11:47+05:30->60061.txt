AURANGABAD: After the demand for designated halts to certain express trains at Mukundwadi railway station has continuously gone unheard, railway activists, led by advocacy group  , have threatened an agitation to highlight the demand.

 They have sought stops for Jalna-Dadar Janshatabdi, Nanded-Mumbai Tapovan and   express trains for the benefit of passengers.
 
 Advocacy group founder  , in a memorandum submitted before the South Central Railway (SCR), demanded halts to aforesaid express trains on a trial basis between May 1 and July 31.
 
 “If the SCR authorities do not pay heed to our demand this time, we will agitate from next month. The railway administration’s apathy has been defeating the purpose of setting up an axillary ‘Mukundwadi’ railway station for Aurangabad. Few key trains must have designated halts,” he said on Thursday.
 
 The ‘D’ category station, which was installed with the Passenger Reservation System (PRS) on April 10 last year, has reportedly seen high ticket sales every day. The increasing load has prompted these activists to raise their demand.
 
 “The daily ticket sale at Mukundwadi is now pegged between Rs 60,000 and Rs 80,000. The sales even cross Rs 1 lakh-mark during festive seasons and vacation periods among other peak days. Needless to say, providing halts to Express trains at Mukundwadi station and revenue generation are linked with each other,” Varma said.
 
 Thrown open to public on January 9, 2000, Mukundwadi railway station was envisaged as the rail facility that would serve northern and eastern parts of the city, including Cidco housing and urban development corporation, Harsul, Chikalthana, Mukundwadi, Pundalik Nagar, Jaybhavani Nagar, Kamgar Chowk, Garkheda and Thackeray Nagar along with nearby localities. Currently, only   and passenger trains make a stop at the Mukundwadi station.
