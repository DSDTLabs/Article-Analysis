The unusually high casualty figure, considering that no more than 48 Maoists were eliminated by the security forces until April 30 last year, includes 40 cadres killed in two encounters at Gadchiroli, Maharashtra, on April 22 and 23. 

 
 The home ministry, in a report listing its achievements over the past four years of   government, claimed that it had contained "the incipient threat" from   (IS) with the arrest of 113 sympathisers of the global outfit from across the country and banning of IS as a "terrorist" organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

The Modi government’s tenure has also seen the direct recruitment of 3,882 J&K youth in the Central forces, 7,302 in the Indian Army and 7,698 as special police officers (SPOs), besides raising of 5 Indian Reserve battalions comprising 4,690 personnel from J&K.

Also, 33 per cent of the non-gazetted posts in the Central forces have been reserved for women.
