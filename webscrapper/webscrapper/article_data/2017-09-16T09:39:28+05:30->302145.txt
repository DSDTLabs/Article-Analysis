CHENNAI: Thanks to the bountiful showers in August, the city’s four reservoirs have enough water to serve residents for nearly 15 more days. The reservoirs had run dry in July, forcing Metrowater to find alternate water sources. Chembaramabakkam, Poondi, Redhills and Cholavaram reservoirs, situated in the suburbs, are the city’s primary water sources.

 A Metrowater official said regular supply from the reservoirs will begin shortly. “Further   is expected this month. We will wait a while before we draw from all four reservoirs,” the official added. The state, in August, recorded the highest rainfall in 50 years. Cholavaram, Redhills and Poondi reservoirs are located in Tiruvallur district, which received 45cm rainfall, 24% above normal, since June. Kanchipuram district, where Chembaramabakkam   is located, recorded 14% excess rainfall.
 
 The combined level of the four reservoirs had fallen below 1% of the total capacity of 11,000 million cubic feet (TMC) in July. On Friday, the combined level was 0.4TMC, nearly 4% of the capacity. In comparison, last year, the reservoirs contained 2.1TMC, about 20% of capacity.
 
 The city may not Krishna water supply from   in the coming months. “For the Andhra government to supply Krishna water, the water level in the Kandaleru reservoir (which stores Krishna water) must be in excess of 13TMC.” The current level of the Kandaleru reservoir is only 3.6TMC. Andhra gets 66% of its annual rainfall between June and September and 24% between October and December. Water level in the city’s reservoirs, however, is likely to rise rapidly from October, when the northeast monsoon sets in.
