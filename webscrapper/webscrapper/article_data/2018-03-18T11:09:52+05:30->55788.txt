COIMBATORE: A newly-married woman, who drenched herself in kerosene in an attempt to stop her husband from visiting his parents, was burnt to death while trying to light a lamp at Perur Chettipalayam here.

 The deceased was identified as 32-year-old T   of   at Perur Chettipalayam, an MBA graduate. She had married her classmate   of   with the blessings of her parents on February 25. The groom’s parents were against the alliance as the couple belonged to different castes.
 
 Thenmozhi objected when Thanga Prabhu, who was working in a private finance firm in  , expressed his wish to visit his parents last Tuesday, police sources said. “She feared that his parents won’t send him back as they were against the intercaste marriage from the beginning. Thenmozhi poured kerosene over her body and threatened to set herself ablaze if he refuses to listen to her. 
 
 The man pacified her and told her to take a bath to wash off the flammable liquid. Meanwhile, power went off and Thenmozhi tried to light a kerosene lamp. But, fire spread on her body soaked in kerosene,” police said. tnn
