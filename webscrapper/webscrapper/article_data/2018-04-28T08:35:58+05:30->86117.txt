PATIALA: State jails minister   ordered a search of the   district jail on Friday morning after a post updated on a social media account in the name of gangster Ravi Deol caught his eye.

SSP M S Sidhu said the raid was kept under wraps and even team leaders were not told where they were heading. Police also questioned Ravi Deol, who denied having uploaded anything on social media. He said there were six accounts being operated in his name without his knowledge. Sidhu said the matter had been referred to the cyber cell to track down the IP address from where the posts had been uploaded. tnn
