JAIPUR: Residents of Barkat Nagar and   are on warpath following the violence at a private hospital in Imli Phatak which occurred three days ago after the death of a patient.

 While the doctors threatened to go on strike, the residents of Barkat Nagar have threatened to close the market in the area.
 
 The former want the police to arrest the accused who attacked   and the residents want Dr Bansal arrested for alleged medical negligence, which resulted in the death of the patient.
 
 The situation has become grave for minister Kalicharan Saraf as the incident happened in his constituency, Malviya Nagar, and that too when he holds the health portfolio. He is in a fix as he has to listen to the complaints of both residents and doctors.
 
 On Monday, Saraf expressed his solidarity with the family of Ratal Saini, who died in the private hospital. Saini’s family members had alleged carelessness and medical negligence on the part of doctors.
 
 “We have demanded the arrest of the doctor. He has assured us that the family of Ratal Saini will receive justice,” said Krishan Kumar, a resident of Barkat Nagar.
 
 He threatened to take to the streets in protest if the demands of residents of Barkat Nagar were not met.
 
 However, different associations of doctors, including the Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors (JARD), Rajasthan   and private medical practitioners, have come in support of Dr Bansal. 
 
 “We have received letters of different association of doctors demanding justice for Dr Bansal. We have given 24 hours to the state government to act on our demand. We have demanded the arrest of those who attacked the doctor. If our demands are not met, we will go on strike,” said Dr S S Joshi, secretary, Jaipur Medical Association.
 
 On Monday, JARD wrote a letter to Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Medical College principal and threatened to boycott work if the accused in the case were not arrested.
