TRICHY: The reputation of the   depends almost entirely on the   and they should develop additional skills to excel in their jobs, said city   commissioner A Amalraj here on Wednesday. He was delivering the special address at the passing-out parade of police constable recruits held at the Temporary Police Recruit School situated at the armed reserve ground at Subramaniapuram.

 Amalraj said that the contribution of constables to the police department was immense. “Out of a total of 1.25 lakh people working in the department, officers constitute less than 20,000. Hence the reputation of the police department lies mostly on the shoulders of the constables,” he said. A total of 298 police constables passed out successfully after completing a seven-month training on the occasion. 
 
 The commissioner emphasised on the point that the new recruits must focus more on developing additional skills. “If you’re good at public speaking or with computer operations, you should spend time developing those skills. You should not consider your job as a hindrance to it,” Amalraj told the police constables. Superintendent of police and principal of the temporary police recruit school, Ziaul Haque, delivered the welcome address. 
 
 A total of 10 medals were distributed for the top performing police constables during the training in three categories – law exam, parade and shooting. Under the law exam category, S Prabhu (gold), M Aravindhan (silver) and M Karthik and P Jayavel (bronze) were awarded medals. S Suriya Varma, M Karthik, and R Rajavel were awarded gold, silver and bronze medals respectively under parade category while P Jayavel, V Gauthaman and A Suriya bagged the top three medals in that order in shooting.
