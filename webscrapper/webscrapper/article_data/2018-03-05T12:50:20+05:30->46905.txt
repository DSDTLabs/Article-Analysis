HYDERABAD : The   ( ) is going soft on advertisers who erect billboards in the city but do not pay for it. With hoardings dotting every inch of the city, activists say, the civic body is losing out on crores in revenue.

 The   ( ), which has filed a case in the   in this regard, said it has found about 2,500 illegal billboards across the city. It has alleged that around ₹50 crore has to be credited to GHMC’s account per year, but strangely this sum is not being deposited.
 
 The civic body gets ₹25 crore per year as revenue from existing authorised billboards, but activists say if the illegal hoardings identified by them are considered, the civic body can generate an additional Rs 50 core as revenue. While the GHMC has identified 333 illegal hoardings, TVPC said its survey confirms 2,500 illegal hoardings in GHMC limits.
 
 “The scam pertaining to illegal hoardings is a result of nexus between advertising companies and government. If the taxes were collected by authorities for all the billboards, more than ₹50 crore would be collected every year. This money could have been used for the city’s development,” said Shyamsunder Goud, president of TVPC.
 
 The committee, which filed acase in the High Court in 2016, asked that if there was no scam involved related to the hoardings, why hadn’t the GHMC presented details about the hoardings in court for two years now.
 
 According to GHMC officials, the committee is yet to produce substantial proof and give a written representation. “We will answer them in court. We will take appropriate action if the people who are claiming that there are 2, 500 illegal billboards, meet us and present us with facts along with a written representation,” said a top GHMC official. Recently, the GHMC carried out a drive to remove 333 illegal billboards in its limits.
