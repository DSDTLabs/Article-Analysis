PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The  , run by the  , has received an approval letter from the state government allowing it to start a post graduate institute affiliated to the B J Medical College, Pune.

 Anil Roy, medical officer of health, PCMC, told TOI: “The letter was received last week. We will be receiving the essentiality certificate from the state government soon. This will be submitted to Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, Nashik, after which they will issue consent of affiliation for Medical Council of India. It will be then submitted to the Union ministry of health and family welfare for obtaining further sanctions.”
 
 “It is a lengthy, but time-bound and necessary process which needs to be completed for obtaining the final permission to start the institute. The process will take one year to complete. As a result, we won’t be able start the courses in the coming academic year,” said Roy.
 
 “The PCMC expects to start conducting three-year post-graduate medical courses at the institute from 2018-19. The initial intake capacity will be 44 seats,” said Roy. 
 
 We will have three-year courses in 10 faculties at the institute. The faculties include medicine, surgery, paediatrics, orthopaedics, psychology, ear nose and throat, pathology, ophthalmology and gynaecology. “The first batch of 44 doctors will work as resident doctors at the YCMH. The institute will provide a maximum of 132 doctors to the hospital after three years of its starting operations,” said Roy.
 
 Located in Pimpri, YCMH is the largest multi-specialty hospital run by the civic body in its limits. It has 650-bed capacity. The staff at the hospital is less when compared to the large number of patients visiting the hospital. The hospital has been facing shortage of doctors too. Former municipal commissioner Shrikar Pardeshi had in 2012 mooted the idea of starting a postgraduate institute at the hospital.
