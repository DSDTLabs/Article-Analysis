The soundtrack of the much-awaited   film, The Great Father is limited to a kids’ song and another lullaby-like track. 

 The music is strictly functional but it is coming from a music director - lyricist duo from whom we have had better compositions. That said, the jukebox might find some fans among kids.
 
 The first song Ko Ko Kozhi, sung by Nakshathra and Prarthana, is a complete kid fest in terms of its lyrics and rendition. A fast number, smartly packaged with imageries of Cinderella, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and more,it can get kids grooving in no time.
 
 Kaiveesi Enne by Vijay Yesudas is a track that has a right amount of pathos as well as happiness. With the right amount of tenderness, the song captures the ‘daddy-loves-his-little-girl’ emotion perfectly.
