ALAPPUZHA: With the campaign for   to end on Saturday, the constituency is witnessing high-voltage campaign by the three fronts.

 Speaking to reporters in Chengannur, opposition leader Ramesh   said   state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was now working as the PRO of the BJP in Chengannur. “The BJP has lost its confidence. But Kodiyeri Balakrishnan is trying to boost the confidence of the BJP by saying that the party is powerful in Chengannur,’’ said Chennithala.
 
 “Will chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan show the courage to say that the bypoll result would be an assessment of his government. LDF government is violating the model code of conduct by giving advertisements highlighting false achievements,” he said.
 
 Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who also campaigned in   on Friday, continued his scathing attack on   leader A K Antony. He said Antony and the Congress could not wash off their hands from their responsibility in the oil price rise, while speaking at an election rally.
 
 “The oil companies were given a free hand of pricing by the previous Congress government. Both Congress and Antony should not run away from the responsibility,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP state general secretary M T Ramesh said that both the LDF and the UDF were fighting in the name of the BJP due to their fear about the bypoll result. “It is very clear that both the fronts will taste failure in this bypoll and the NDA candidate P S   will enjoy a cake walk and will get a thumping majority in this bypoll. So they are fighting in the name of the BJP,” he said.
 
 The public campaign will end on Saturday evening. The voting will take place on May 28 and the counting will be held on May 31 and the result will be announced on the same day.
