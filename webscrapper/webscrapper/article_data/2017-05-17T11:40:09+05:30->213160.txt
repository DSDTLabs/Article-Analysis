BHOPAL/RAIPUR: The CRPF on Tuesday claimed to have gunned down 10-15 Maoists in a massive operation after “storming the core area“ of the rebels in Bastar's Dantewada on Sunday, in a bid to avenge the 
  on April 24.

 “Our forces, who went deep into the forests to carry out the operations, saw Maoists falling down after being hit by bullets. However, neither bodies nor weapons could be recovered during these operations," a senior officer of the Chhattisgarh police told TOI on Tuesday night.
 
 The operation was carried out in Bijapur's Basakura area by a joint team of CRPF, CoBRA, Special Task Force and District Reserve Group, according to a CRPF officer.
 
 The mission was coordinated by a joint command and control centre and closely monitored from Raipur, DIG Dantewada P Sunderraj is heard saying in a videographed interview to ANI. In the interview, Sunderraj calls the mission a "very successful operation." 
 
 There were reports a few days ago of CoBRA commandos being heli-dropped into the jungles of Bastar, and on Sunday, a wounded STF was flown to Raipur for treatment, indicating something was on in the forests. He died on Monday. 
 
 The first exchange of fire was on the morning of May 14 (Sunday), the DIG says in the interview. Two jawans were injured and evacuated. Sporadic gunfights continued all day, culminating in a major encounter in the evening, he says, adding that "10-15 Maoists were possibly killed in both exchanges and many injured."
 
 Asked why there aren't any bodies or captured weapons to show, the DIG says that when troopers were evacuating the casualties, the rebels took advantage and whisked away the bodies. "Searches are on."
