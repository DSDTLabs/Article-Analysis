CHENNAI : Under the guise of strengthening government-run District Institutes of Education and   (DIET), Tamil Nadu the government has reduced number of   for pre-service teacher training   by nearly 80%. 

 As many as 4,800 seats were available in 32   located across Tamil Nadu. This has been reduced to 1,050 now, according to orders issued by the state school education department on Wednesday. 
 
 Accordingly,   teacher training programs will be offered only in 10 out of the 32 DIETs from the forthcoming academic year and only in-service training for teachers will be provided in the remaining 22 DIETs. 
 
 The 22 centres include those in Trichy, Coimbatore, Madurai, Salem and Kanyakumari. Teacher training aspirants should travel to the neighbouring districts of Perambalur, Kotagiri (Nilgiris district), Virudhunagar, Krishnagiri and Tirunelveli respectively. 
 
 Aspirants from Chennai’s outskirts (Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur) should also travel to Chennai to enroll for pre-service training. 
 
 The government in its order has cited a study by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) on functioning of DIETs. This study revealed that some of the DIETs were not functioning to the optimal level as enrollment for pre-service training has come down over the years. 
 
 “Moreover, requirement of in-service training has gone up in the view of revision of curriculum and introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in schools,” the study further said. 
 
 Against this backdrop, the   (MHRD) had also in its guidelines sent to Tamil Nadu on February, asked the state to restructure DIETs. 
 
 Invariably, all DIETs will have one principal, one vice-principal, five senior lecturers, 14 lecturers and one librarian. The pay structure of faculty will see no change, the order said.
