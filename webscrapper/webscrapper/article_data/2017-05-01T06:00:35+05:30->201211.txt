The police recovered instruments such as a screw driver and other electricity instrument. The police official said that prima facie it appears that the deceased was attempting to steal transformer from the power house but died after he was electrocuted.
 
 “He was a resident of Kashipura village, some of the wires of the transformer were cut, which gave rise to the suspicion that he was attempting to uproot the entire transformer. However, we are probing the case to verify his cause of death,” a police official said.
 
 The victim’s father said in his report that his son was missing since Saturday night. “He was last spotted with four of his friends; it seems that after dumping Rakesh’s body alongside the road, the rest fled,” the officials said.
 
 The police said that half of the victim’s body was charred in the mishap, the body was sent for autopsy after which it was handed over to his family. The police said that Rakesh was involved in other criminal cases too.
 
 “We have been told that he was earlier involved in crimes such as stealing. However, nothing can be confirmed until we track down some of his other aides who were with him on Saturday night,” the police official said, adding that family members and friends are being quizzed to get details of the case.
