 This year, the entrance exams to PG courses are set to be conducted online in 18 cities. Delhi will be the centre for NCR. The applicants will be given the option of choosing a centre, though officials said the exam will be held at the centre only if there are enough number of applicants appearing there.
 
 However, officials warned that after making payments and completing the application online, no change in centre preferences will be allowed. The same goes for other details that are to be filled in the form. 
 
 However, the admission portal will be reopened after qualifying examination results have been declared to allow students to update their marks. They will be allowed to register using their registered email ID. The same registration process will also allow admissions under School of Open Learning and Non Collegiate Women’s Education Board.
 
 Unlike the UG registration process, officials said, the applicant for a PG programme will have to fill a separate form for each PG course they apply for. “The same login details shall be used for all registration forms. The applicant shall be required to pay a separate registration fee for applying to each course,” the information bulletin, which was released on Friday night, stated. 
 
 Officials said that students, irrespective of the mode of admission, have to register themselves online. The admit card for entrance tests will be available for download after June 7.
