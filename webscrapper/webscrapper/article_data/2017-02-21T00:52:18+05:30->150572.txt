NEW DELHI: The final word is out on the impact of   on Delhi’s   from  . While the total tax collections till January stand at Rs 17,708 crore in the current fiscal as against Rs 16,668 crore for the same period in 2015-16, the assessment for the period between December and January this year has revealed a dismal scenario.

 In December, the revenue collection for the first time witnessed a negative growth of almost minus 4% over the same period in 2015 while in January, there was only a marginal recovery with a dismal growth rate of 1.72% over January 2015. The average growth rate before demonetisation was announced in November was between 8% and 10%.
 
 The VAT department’s hopes now rest on the February collections which appear to be picking up.
 
 The revenue target for 2016-17 from VAT has been pitched at Rs 22,000 crore. The government has just eight days of February and the month of March left to make up for the decline in growth rate. Also, the global decline in the construction sector, iron and steel continues to hold sway and has adversely impacted VAT collections since last year.
 
 After a robust VAT collection of Rs 2,023 core in November 2016, which was 15.59% higher than the same period the previous year and more than the monthly average of 8% to 10% witnessed in 2016 over 2015, December recorded a negative growth in VAT for the first time in the current fiscal. In December, VAT collections were Rs 1,687 crore, 4% less than Rs 1,757 crore earned last year. This was clearly a setback for the state government.
 
 The increase in November had been attributed to more tax being paid between October 21 and November 21. Since Diwali was on October 30, pre-Diwali sales had also got reflected in the November tax cycle. Also, since most traders deposit VAT in the last days of the monthly cycle, tax was paid after demonetisation kicked in. The spike is also being attributed to the fact that traders paid tax after demonetisation by showing pre-dated sales.
 
 It was after this that the impact of demonetisation started showing as a reduced cash flow meant a massive decline in cash-based transactions on which tax is levied. Also the reduced cash flow impacted the manufacturing and trade sectors too as a lot of transactions there too were largely cash-based and declined. December reflected the adverse impact at its peak when a negative growth was recorded.
