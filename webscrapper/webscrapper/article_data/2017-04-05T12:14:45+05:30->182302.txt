AMRITSAR: Ten-year-old Hina may soon hope to get out of the jail where her mother Mumtaz, a Pakistani national, gave birth to her while serving a sentence in a drug peddling case. Coming to the aid of Mumtaz and another Pakistani woman prisoner, a Batala-based NGO has offered to pay their fine of Rs 4 lakh to ensure their immediate release from  .

 Fatima and Mumtaz were arrested on May 8, 2006, at Attari international border after they were found smuggling narcotics into India. Both of them were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and were jailed for 10-and-a-half years which got completed in November 2016. 
 
 “The court had also slapped a fine of Rs 2 lakh each and in case of non-payment of fine, both of them had to serve another two years in jail,” said advocate  , who is also the chairperson of Society for   and Green Causes.
 
 Chabba said she had spoken to the parents of Fatima and Mumtaz in Pakistan but they refused to extend any financial help and instead wanted them to undergo two more years of imprisonment. Fatima, who was pregnant at the time of her arrest, gave birth to a girl in the Amritsar central jail.
 
 “As soon as we came to know about the matter, we decided to deposit their fine of Rs 4 lakh to ensure their quick release from the jail,” said president of   Navtej Singh on Tuesday.
 
 “We are upset to even imagine that the young girl would spend another two years in jail for no fault of hers. Through our act, we want to send a message to Pakistan that people on both sides and the governments should shed differences and work for the uplift of the society and lessen miseries,” said Navtej.
