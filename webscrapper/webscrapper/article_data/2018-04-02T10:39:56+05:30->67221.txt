 -   starrer 'Aabhasam' grabbed headlines right when its title was released, as the name is an acronym of 'Aarsha Bharatha Samskaram' or the glorious Indian culture.

  As the trailer of the film comes out, we get a lot more insights into what the proceedings are going to be like. It starts off asking on which bus one wants a seat, quoting names like Godse, Gandhi, Jinnah, Marx and more. Suraj Venjaramoodu, Alencier, Rima Kallingal and others, the travellers and workers on them, seem to represent a variety of interesting ideas. Transgender activist   is also featured on the trailer, playing a prominent role.
 
 The movie has music by Oorali band, and also has Maammukkoya, Indrans and Nasser among the cast. It will be in theaters for Vishu.
