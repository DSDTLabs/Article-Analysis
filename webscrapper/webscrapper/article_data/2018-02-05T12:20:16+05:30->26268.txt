Even as politicians, industrialists and activists are demanding a special status for Andhra Pradesh, actor Nikhil Siddharth has also joined the chorus and has urged the government to release funds for the truncated state. Nikhil, who had travelled across the state, was shocked to see the situation. The actor feels that a lot more needs to be done to ensure development of the state, and insists that it can only happen if enough funds are allocated to it by the government. "Im just an Actor nd many will say "Neeku ivvi Enduku" but I hav shot across Ap recently nd realised how much work needs 2 be done 2 get an urban centre going in the State,which is only possible through huge funding frm the govt. As a Telugu nd an Indian    (sic)," Nikhil posted on Twitter.  On the work front, Nikhil awaits the release of 'Kirrak Party', in which he plays the role of a college student. Directed by Sharan Koppisetty, the film is slated to release later this month.
