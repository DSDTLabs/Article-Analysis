KOLKATA: A racket that had been duping people through fake matrimonial advertisements was busted on Thursday. Prime accused  , 48, was arrested from   and sent to four days' judicial custody by an Alipore court. Cops are looking for other members of the gang. Mukherjee allegedly duped   Pal, 69, a resident of   in Rajdanga, of Rs 1.7 lakh. 

 Pal had got in touch with Mukherjee after he spotted an insertion in the matrimonial columns of a daily where Mukherjee, who claimed to be a senior vigilance officer with the Railways, sought a match. 
 
 According to Pal's complaint, Mukherjee didn't look or behave like a senior railway official. On further inquiry, he came to know that Mukherjee was a private security guard at a city mall. Pal immediately stopped all communications with the fraud.
 
 "A few days later, Pal received a call from Mumbai from someone claiming to be  , chief vigilance officer with the Railways and Mukherjee's boss. He said Mukherjee had attempted suicide after being 'insulted' by Pal and   had begun a probe. He advised it would be better if Pal settled the matter and paid Rs 1.7 lakh. Pal deposited the money in two accounts. When more money was demanded, Pal lodged a complaint at Kasba police station," an officer said.
