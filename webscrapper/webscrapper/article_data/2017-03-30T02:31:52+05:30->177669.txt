MUMBAI: The   has allocated Rs 3,311.73 crore, around 13% of the overall budget, for  .   and diagnosis has got a major boost with BMC allocating Rs 90.61 crore for the programme. A provision of Rs 16.15 crore has also been made to strengthen primary health centres that will soon start offering free diagnostic services. 

  While experts have hailed the attention towards health, many are unhappy that the money for creating and strengthening of health infrastructure has been slashed by 38%.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner  , however, said funds have been allocated for crucial areas. “We plan to add 400 ventilators so that there is one with every ICU bed. A provision of 30 crore has been proposed,” she said. The budget has also touched upon another neglected area of burns care. This financial year, there are plans to improve the existing burns centres at Kasturba, KEM and Sion hospitals, while also setting up standalone ones.
 
 Security in corporation has finally found the required impetus. “We want to create an atmosphere where doctors can work fearlessly,” said BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta. Kundan said soon 400-plus armed security personnel will be added from   (MSSC). A divisional security officer will coordinate with MSCC and police where there is any untoward situation. Alarms too will be installed. 
 
 For TB control, 14 additional sites have been started to facilitate early diagnosis of drug resistant TB. There is a proposal to upgrade lab facilities at KEM and Sewri TB Hospital. Kundan added that dispensaries will be spruced up to carry out x-rays, TB culture and other blood tests. “A unique programme ‘aapli chikitsa’ will be launched through dispensaries, where people can access basic tests. The services will be outsourced to private agencies but it will essentially stop patients from flocking to major hospitals,” said Kundan. Mumbai has 183 dispensaries and the 2017-18 budget has proposed to add ten more in the years to come.
