Panaji: The state government will move the Supreme Court to vacate the high court of Bombay at Goa order staying reservation and delimitation of some wards for the June 11 panchayat elections. “We will file the petition challenging the high court order on Friday,” panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho told TOI on Thursday.  The high court on Wednesday had stayed the reservation and delimitation exercise in some wards after some aspirants approached the court with a plea that the rotation policy of reservation of wards was not followed and it was made without adhering to criteria.  The stay was also sought on the grounds that delimitation of wards was undertaken illegally. On Thursday, the state government rushed director of panchayats Sandhya Kamat to Delhi to consult with advocates and challenge the order in the Supreme Court. Sources said the government wants to file a petition in the Supreme Court on Thursday itself, but was unable to do it. The state election commission is planning to approach the high court to seek clarity on its order.
