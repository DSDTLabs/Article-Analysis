CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday allowed  , former driver of   (DSS) chief  , to record his statement afresh in relation to journalist Ramchander Chattarpati and Ranjit Singh murder cases.

 Justice Augustine George Masih has passed these orders after allowing Khatta Singh’s plea.   chief had strongly opposed the move.
 Khatta Singh had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court against the orders of special   court   that had dismissed his plea to depose against DSS chief in the ongoing murder case.
 
 In his appeal, Khatta Singh had submitted before the HC that his statement was very crucial for the cases and he had given several grounds to show his bonafide as to why he resiled from the earlier statements being under threat from Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and his henchman. 
 
 Khatta Singh, who is among those castrated inside dera, also stated that the only reasons given by the special CBI judge for not permitting him to recall his statement, was that the trial of the case was pending for more than 10-years and now the case is on the final stage of argument. 
 
 On September 25, special CBI judge, Jagdeep Singh had dismissed his application finding no merits in his plea. 
 
 Khatta Singh, who retracted his statement in 2012, had approached the special CBI court after dera chief’s conviction in rape cases, seeking permission to record his statements afresh regarding dera head’s role in murder cases.
 
 According to Singh, he had changed his testimony earlier due to threat from baba and his goons and not the CBI.
