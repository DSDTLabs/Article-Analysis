NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has ordered   to set up an   to investigate the   in   This was after a petition was filed by former ad hoc teachers of the college, alleging that appointments were made on forged papers.

 The petitioners had claimed that applicants had even made false claims about past experience and authorship of research papers. Many teachers say the investigation committee might open a pandora’s box. “There have been instances when forged documents were used by certain teachers who were recruited without any scrutiny of their credentials. The recent law faculty appointments may have also been the same,” said a teacher who wished to remain anonymous.
 
 Documents accessed by TOI revealed that one of the petitioners, who had appeared before the selection committee in 2015 for the post of assistant professor, had a better academic quality index than many of those who were appointed.
 
 “Most of the AQI scores of these selected candidates were manipulated and modulated. Many of them presented proof of their previous experience, which was found to be false. Also, several had claimed sole authorship of research papers, but it was found that either those papers did not exist or that there were multiple authors of the papers,” said copetitioner Pranav Chaudhary.
 
 Some of the teachers who were not selected had complained to the VC about “large scale irregularities” in April 2016. “But we received no response, forcing us to go to court,” a teacher said. But principal Gyantosh Jha dismissed the allegations and said the matter was under investigation.
