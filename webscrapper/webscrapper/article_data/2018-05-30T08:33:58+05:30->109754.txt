MAPUSA: Senior state BJP functionary and   MLA   D’Souza said on Tuesday that he has spoken to chief minister Manohar   and his treatment will be complete by month-end, after which he will return to Goa

 “He may stay there for another 15 days. He is taking solid food and gaining his weight. He is consuming home made food and there are absolutely no problems with him, only his treatment should get over,” D’Souza said in Mapusa.
 
 Before he left for the US on March 8, Parrikar had designated the cabinet advisory committee (CAC) comprising Francis D’Souza (BJP), Sudin Dhavalikar (MGP) and Vijai Sardesai (Goa Forward Party) to oversee the day-to-day administration in his absence.
 
 D’Souza had earlier said that the formation of the three-member CAC was better than having a single person assume leadership during Parrikar’s absence as all the major parties have representation in the CAC and decisions are taken collectively.
 
 “We (CAC) have sought the advice of the chief minister only on certain issues which have come before the CAC. We have asked him whether it should be done, fast tracked or not done at all. All the issues or subjects put before Parrikar have been passed by him so far,” D’Souza said.
