 Agra: Suspecting that his teenaged girlfriend was unfaithful to him, a 21-year-old man allegedly hacked her to death while she was alone in her house at Gadiya Bhojpur village, Aligarh on Friday morning. While she bled to death, he fled from the scene. A case has been registered under relevant sections of the IPC and police are looking for him.   Talking with TOI, SSP, Rajesh Pandey said the victim was slashed with a sharp-edged weapon seven times and sustained a six-inch-deep cut on her neck. Her body has been sent for a post-mortem. The accused reportedly fled the scene after removing his blood stained clothes.    According to station officer, Jawan, Amit Yadav, the accused, Binesh, went to the girlâ€™s house at about 9:30 am when she was alone. He said though both belonged to the same caste, their families had opposed to their marriage.    In fact six months ago, the village panchayat had to step in to resolve the matter. Police said the girl was subsequently sent to her older sister's house at Nagariya village and was staying there for the past five months.    There, she allegedly developed a relationship with another man, infuriating Binesh. He reportedly went there to meet her but he was beaten up by her new boyfriend.    Enraged, Binesh reached her house in the morning and hacked her to death. According to neighbours, she had come back home just five days ago.
