SURAT: The   (SMC) has set up a quick response team for Nipah virus in case there is any outbreak of this infection in the city. Health officials have set up the quick response team because of presence of fruit orchards, bats and pigs in huge numbers in   and   districts which aid in the spread of NiV. 

 
 SMC chief medical officer Dr Aashish Naik told TOI, “Four fully equipped mobile teams with doctors and eight paramedics have been assigned to the team. All hospitals have been instructed to report any suspicious cases of NiV. Dr   is the nodal officer.” 
 
  
 There is no medicine for NiV, which was first recognized in the large outbreak in 1998-99. This is why the fatality rate of NiV is quite high. 
 
 Fruit bats appear to be the natural reservoir of NiV. Domestic pigs work as amplifying host. Those working in orchards with bare hands can get infected with the virus. Scientists have also found evidence of NiV in domesticated cats, dogs, sheep and horses.
 
 “When a human being is infected with NiV, he has fever, suffers from headache, laziness, mental imbalance, fits and then goes into coma. These symptoms are seen in a person after 5 to 14 days of getting the infection. When someone gets infected through a pig, he or she has neurological and respiratory problems. There is 100% morbidity in such cases,” said a doctor.
