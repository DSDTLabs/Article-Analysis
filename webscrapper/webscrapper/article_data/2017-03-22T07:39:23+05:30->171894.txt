AHMEDABAD:   on Tuesday morning arrested Tasavvur Pathan, 55, from SG Road for holding two  , one genuine and one fake.   said Pathan also holds a   and   is trying to get its details.

 Senior ATS sources said Pathan’s fake passport bears details of his uncle Raja Pathan, but has Tasavvur’s photo.
 
 “His original passport was issued from RPO Ahmedabad. We have sought details of all the passports, and are checking from where he received help to obtain the fake passports,” an ATS official said.
 
 Pathan is a native of Bashti in Uttar Pradesh and came to Gujarat after his marriage, said ATS officials. His family lives in Ahmedabad. “In 1991, Pathan had gone to Saudi Arabia and had returned in 1999. He had stayed with his uncle, Raja Pathan, in Surat’s Lal Darwaja area,” said an ATS source.
 
 “He used to work in a car garage in Durban, and has also applied for permanent residence in South Africa. He had returned to Ahmedabad about eight months ago,” an ATS official said.
 
 ATS sources said they had arrested Pathan following a tip-off and are currently interrogating him. “Pathan also holds a South African passport,” said an ATS official, adding, “It is strange for a person to hold three passports, two in the same name and one in a fake name. We will be producing him in court on Wednesday to get remand,” said an ATS official.
 
 ATS officials said Pathan had obtained both passports including the one in his name and the one in his uncle’s name in 1999, after which he had gone to South Africa.
