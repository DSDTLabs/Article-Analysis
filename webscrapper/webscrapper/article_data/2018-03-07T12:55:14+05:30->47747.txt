MADURAI: Tension prevailed at the corporation zone I office on Tuesday as functionaries of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) along with residents, staged a protest against the government and civic body for effecting a steep hike in property tax.

 Later, a few of them were allowed by the police to go inside the zonal office and petition commissioner of  , Aneesh  , who had come there to receive petitions from the public during the special grievance meeting. The functionaries were led by urban secretary of CPM, Madurai, R  . They urged the commissioner to bring down the tax and also appealed to him to take up the issue with the state government.
 
 Vijayarajan said, “At a time when residents are suffering without jobs and failing agriculture, the civic body has increased the tax. Apart from the property tax the civic body is forcing the residents to cough up tax for garbage. It has also increased the tax for underground drainage and water connection.”
 
 A resident, who had been paying Rs 133 as property tax for every six months, has to pay Rs 1,246 now, according to the revised tax. Worse, the civic body is forcing people to pay it retrospectively from 2011.
 
  Most of the petitions received were related to property tax issue. Usually, there would be 40 petitions on an average during the grievance meeting, but on Tuesday as many as 174 petitions were received. Replying to the concerns, the commissioner said that only those who violated the building layouts are asked to pay the tax retrospectively. If the residents can prove that there was no violation they need not pay the tax retrospectively, he said.
