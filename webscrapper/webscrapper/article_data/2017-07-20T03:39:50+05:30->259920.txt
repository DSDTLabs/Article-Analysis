 Similarly, in the absence of the pilots to fly Cessna Citati-on business jet, the government was hiring them from private agencies. This was costly, so the panel has decided to hire two pilots on contract. “Three companies have come forward, we are scrutinising them,” said an official.
 
 The committee is also considering disposing of the Dauphin helicopter and the King Air aircraft, which hasn’t been used in eight years. According to a rough estimate, they will fetch the government Rs 1 crore each. “There is also a discussion whether to donate them to a flying club or use them for public displays. A final decision is yet to be taken,” said the official.
