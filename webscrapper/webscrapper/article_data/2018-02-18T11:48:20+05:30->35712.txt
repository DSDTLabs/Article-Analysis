CHANDIGARH: Around 2,000 residents out of 10,000 served   have paid the levy to the municipal corporation, making the civic body richer by Rs 80 lakh. 

 It is for the first time that the civic body had served notices in bulk to residents on a regular basis and adopted strict measures to collect the tax. 
 
 Since the authority has been compiling notices ward-wise, the tax branch is preparing more notices to be sent to residents.
 
 "Over 200 residents are visiting the   office daily to ask about the formalities to pay the tax, calculation method of the areas of houses and other related aspects. Besides 125 to 150 people have been taking applications forms to fill the tax amount. Not only this, we have been getting hundreds of inquiries over phone too on a daily basis," said a senior officer of the MC.
 
 Earlier, the focus was only on   of the city and notices were being sent to them only. 
 
 "Most of the times employees of the tax branch are also confused about the process and have to take assistance of seniors to know the exact  ," sources said.
