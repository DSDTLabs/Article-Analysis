CHENNAI: Tipplers can raise a toast. Trade unions of   employees in the southern suburbs have resolved not to overcharge consumers and stick to the MRP from Saturday. The development follows a scuffle between a bar owner and Tasmac workers at an outlet near Tambaram after the former allegedly demanded a cut in the overcharged revenue from the employees two days ago. 

  
  
 
 According to sources, the decision not to fleece the consumers was taken during a meeting between the joint action committee of   and Tasmac’s Kancheepuram north district manager on Friday. “The bar owners are threatening us with dire consequences if we do not share the overcharged revenue. But they cannot demand the same if we are marketing liquor as per the MRP,” a Tasmac source said. A total of 116 wine outlets are operating in Alandar, Adambakkam, Tambaram, parts of ECR, OMR and Sriperumpudur, falling under the jurisdiction of Kancheepuram north district of the state-owned marketing corporation. Of these, nearly 100 liquor outlets are attached to bars.
 
 Tasmac sources said the shops in Kancheepuram north district earn an average revenue of Rs 3 crore everyday. Sources said revenue generated by overcharging is estimated to be Rs 30 lakh. Customers are forced to shell out anywhere between Rs 10 and Rs 150 over and above the MRP depending on the brand, quantity and location of shops. 
 
 However, an employee said implementing the decision may be a challenge because a similar attempt in the neighbouring Tiruvallur had not been successful beyond a day. D Dhanasekaran, general secretary of   affiliated to AITUC, said “We need the support of Tasmac administration for the purpose as they should protect us from any threat from bar owners or pressure from any corner,” he said.
 
 A senior Tasmac official said action will be initiated against any employee found overcharging.
