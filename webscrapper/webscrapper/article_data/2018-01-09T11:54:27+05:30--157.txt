PUNE: The city’s rank in the ‘Swachh Bharat’ survey will not be determined by just the civic administrations’ claims. 

 Random field checks and, more importantly, citizens’ feedback, will heavily swing the result. The Centre has assigned 35% weight to citizen feedback in the survey, which started last week.
 
 Around 500 cities with a population of over 1 lakh will be ranked at a national level in the survey.
 
 Pune Municipal Corporation has set up a toll-free number (1969), on which citizens can give a “missed call” and answer a small questionnaire on the status of garbage in the city. 
 
 The questionnaire will comprise six questions, which can also be answered on the official website. 
 
 The survey aims to determine the cleanest city in the country. The ranking would be based on infrastructure development for improved sanitation services and their sustainability, outcomes, citizen connect and visible impact on the ground..
 
 The government has also introduced an app, ‘Swachhata’, wherein   pertaining to garbage. The municipal administration is expected to act on the complaint in a time-bound manner. After resolving the complaint, the user can rate the civic administration’s response. 
 
 Suresh Jagtap, head of PMC’s solid waste management department, said that efforts were underway to deal with all complaints registered through the app.
 
 However, civic activists remain sceptical about the efficacy of the survey. Activists said   should act on its own to resolve the problem, rather than wait for citizens’ feedback. 
 
 “I have been following up the issue at various levels in the government and sought to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to how the ( ) is not delivering,” said   of Nagrik Chetna Manch.
