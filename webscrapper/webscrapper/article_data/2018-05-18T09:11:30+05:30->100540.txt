MYSURU:   party workers gathered in large numbers at the party’s office in the city on Thursday asking the Mysuru city president of the Congress to initiate stringent action against those involved in   during the assembly election campaign.

 Scores of followers of  , who lost the   constituency to BJP’s L Nagendra, accused former Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) president   of indulging in anti-party activities. Vasu’s supporters alleged that Dhruvakumar too has been in contention for the Chamaraja ticket, and that, on being denied, had campaigned for Independent and JD(S) rebel K Harish Gowda. Vasu’s supporters pointed out that the former MLA had undertaken developmental projects to the tune of Rs 1,600 crore during his five-year tenure, and that his defeat had come as a shock.
 
 However, Vasu intervened later and convinced his followers to withdraw the protest. “I was defeated in the election because of various reasons including ‘hacking’ and anti-party activities. But, I am happy with what I have done during my tenure including the construction of a new building for the Maharani’s Commerce and Management College and Hostel, creating a trauma centre, setting up Jayadeva Hospital among other projects,” said Vasu.
 
 The party leaders, on the other hand, assured the protesters that those found to have been involved in anti-party activities would not be spared, and added that the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee would initiate strict action against them.
