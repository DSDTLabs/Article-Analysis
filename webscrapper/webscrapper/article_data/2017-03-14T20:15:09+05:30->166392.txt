TIRUVANNAMALAI:   leader Dr S   on Tuesday said his party would not contest in the April 12   in   constituency.

 After taking part in the party’s general body meeting in Tiruvannamalai, Ramadoss told reporters that the party would not extend support to any party.
 
 Calling the Election Commission of India (ECI) a puppet, he said that the by-poll would not be held in a democratic way. “It is against the beliefs of the party to contest in by-elections,” he added.
 
 The byelection was necessitated by the death of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa.
