CHANDIGARH: The   that promotes   and distributes dustbins has forgotten to install any trash can in the market of Sector 19. Shopkeepers say the civic authorities don’t pay heed to their demand. 

 The TOI team found no dustbin in this entire market near a police station. The shopkeepers and visitors are left with no option but to dispose of   in the open. People living nearby are tired of seeing their littered streets. They say that most of this waste is from small eateries and has drawn stray dogs .
 
 Residents want to know why when a big national programme of universal cleanliness is on that it is so difficult for the civic authorities to place a small dustbin at the market. Sector 19 active social welfare association president   said the shopkeepers had taken the matter to the area councillor as well. “Under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, free dustbins are being distributed all the over the city, but they can’t give a dustbin.” Area councillor   said nobody had ever complained to her about the issue but she will get it resolved.
