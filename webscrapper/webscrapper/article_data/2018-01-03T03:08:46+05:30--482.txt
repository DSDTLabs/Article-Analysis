NEW DELHI: The   department is soon going to start sending notices to autorickshaw and   owners who don’t have functional   in their vehicles. The owners would get a month to comply with the norms after getting the notice or pay up to Rs 4,500 fine.

 All passenger vehicles in the city are supposed to have functional GPS for real-time tracking, but in reality, most autorickshaws and taxis don’t have them. The transport   had recently set up a 24X7 control room, which would be the centre for tracking autorickshaws, taxis and public transport and also all enforcement action taken by the department.
 
 “We plan to track the vehicles in real time keeping in mind the safety of passengers, particularly women. The total vehicles that should have GPS are close to 2.5 lakh and we are trying to ensure they follow the norms,” said a transport department official. 
 
 The control room at the department’s headquarter, is divided into sub-sections. The first section focuses on tracking all para-transit vehicles, including autorickshaws, Gramin Sewa vehicles, RTVs, feeder services etc. Apart from tracking taxis, the department also plans to start monitoring cabs of app-based aggregators soon. “The City Taxi Scheme 2017 is in the final stages and once it comes into operation, app-based cabs will also be monitored,” the official said.
 
 Apart from autorickshaws and taxis, the department also plans to track DTC and Cluster scheme buses operated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS). Most DTC buses, however, don’t have functional GPS devices at present.
