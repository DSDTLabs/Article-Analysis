GURUGRAM: A 35-year-old woman lodged a complaint against unknown person(s), claiming they have created a   Facebook   of hers and uploaded her phone number.

 The old DLF colony resident had approached police with her complaint earlier in May this year.
 
 According to SHO Bharatendera of Sector 14 police station, where the FIR was registered on Friday, unknown person(s) created a fake profile of the woman on Facebook, uploaded her phone number, and posted vulgar insinuations and photos of her. Soon, she started getting phone   from unknown men. The woman told cops she continued to be harassed by the calls into the night.
 
 She shared some of the numbers from where she had got crank calls. The complaint has been forwarded to the cyber crime unit, which tracked down the location from where the account was created. “We sent a notice to Facebook, with the IP address of the device used to create the ID,” said the cop probing the case.
 
 An FIR was registered at Sector 14 police station on Friday, under sections 354 (sexual  ) of IPC and 66C (identity theft) and 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material) of the IT Act.
