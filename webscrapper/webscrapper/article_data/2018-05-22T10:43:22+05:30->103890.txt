NEW DELHI/KARWAR/BENGALURU: BJP pounced on Congress MLA  's claim that the audio clip released by his party two days ago to make allegations against BJP that it was trying to buy support of MLAs for BS   was fake.

 
 Accusing Congress of disseminating "doctored tapes”, Shah said BJP leaders accused in the fake tapes should take legal action against Congress. "The revelation made by the Congress MLA makes it clear as to how the misinformation campaign was carried out by Congress. Unfortunately, media ran them without verifying. The entire fake campaign was to put pressure on Supreme Court,” Shah said.
 
 Congress MLC V S Ugrappa had released the audio tape on Saturday hours before the scheduled trust vote, claiming it had the voices of Yedyurappa's son Vijayendra and Hebbar's wife Varalakshmi.
 
 In the audio tape, Rs 15 crore and a ministerial berth for Hebbar is being offered if the Congress MLA abstains from voting. However, Hebbar contradicted Ugrappa's claim in a Facebook post written in Kannada. He questioned the authenticity of the audio clip, saying: "The voice is not of my wife. She did not get a call.” He added: "Whoever released such tape has my dhikkar (condemnation). The audio tape is fake.” Congress claimed BJP leaders were trying to ‘poach' party MLAs by offering ‘blandishments'.
 
 In the audio conversation, the person who allegedly contacted Hebbar's wife asks her what her husband wants. The woman pleads for help to get her son out of criminal cases in which he is accused. The person on the other side assures help. Hebbar's son Vivek is an accused in the Belekeri iron ore case and also in mining related cases in Goa and Jharkhand where BJP is in office.
 
 Neither Shivaram Hebbar nor his family were available for comment. KPCC president G Parameshwara said: "Hebbar may have denied it for various reasons, but all the recordings we released to the media are authentic."
