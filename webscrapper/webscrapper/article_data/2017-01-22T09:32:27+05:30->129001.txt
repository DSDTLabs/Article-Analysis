HYDERABAD: It's raining love matches at the Pullela Gopichand   Academy (PGBA). Following in the footsteps of their coach who got married to former national champion Laxmi, several shuttlers are going to walk down the aisle with their practice partners in the coming months.

 Popular doubles players   are getting engaged on February 1. The shuttlers, who have won Grand Prix tournaments with their respective partners this season, are getting married in December. Sumeeth had partnered Manu Attri in the Rio Olympics and Sikki is now pairing up with former Commonwealth Games champion   in wo men's doubles. 
 
 Sikki's mixed doubles partner Pranaav Jerry Chopra tied the knot with Pradnya Gadre, who was a former partner of Sikki, last month. Pranaav and Pradnya are trainees of the  . Last January, Kerala's Arun Vishnu and Maharashtra'a Arundhati Pantawane, both from PGBA, got married. Shuttlers finding love on the badminton court is nothing new but what surprised many was the engagement between doubles specialist Akshay Dewalkar and Mridu Sharma. While Dewalkar is the doubles partner of Pranaav Chopra, Mridu is the psychologist appointed by Sports Authority of India (SAI) to work with the shuttlers at the academy.
 
 Asked if this leads to a conflict of interest, Mridu said: “I know people will ask me this question. But Akshay is not my client.” 
 
 “I only worked with Pranaav, so when the proposal came from Akshay I discussed it with my family and they are happy about it,” said Mridu, who works with several shuttlers, including the likes of Verma brothers Sameer and Sourabh.
