British actress   recently revealed that although she is a sexual assault survivor, still she will not let that label define her.

 
  
 
  The 25-year-old actress spoke out about being sexually assaulted when she was just 12 in a post on   last year while responding to the   movement sweeping across social media.
 
  She thanked the women who came before her for sharing their stories and give her the courage to do the same.
 
  The   star said, "I will be asked about it forever now. I hope it doesn't define me but it will always be under my name and I accept that - but I am proud I was brave enough to do it and I am grateful for the support I had from friends".
 
  Kaya took to Twitter on 16 October to tell her story.
 
  "It's taken me 13 years to say  . He is still protected by 'family members' in  . They've told lies to papers to try to silence me", she tweeted.
 
  "No more", she added, "I want to thank every single person who has spoken out about sexual assault/harassment recently.You've given me the courage. To finally speak out and not be afraid. To everyone still suffering silently, you never asked for it. NOBODY DOES."
 
  The actress further said that the 'Me Too' movement showed the women that sexual assault "could happen to any person, it can be a friend, sister or women serving you food in a restaurant".
 
  "So I thought if I can do that for one person then I owe it to my 12-year-old self", Kaya concluded.
