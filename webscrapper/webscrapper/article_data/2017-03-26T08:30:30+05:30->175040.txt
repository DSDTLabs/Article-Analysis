MADURAI: Padmanabapuram   has filed a public interest litigation before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court alleging that officials connived with some persons in obtaining leases for illegal stone quarries in Kalkulam taluk of Kanyakumari district. 

 Following it, the division bench headed by Justice A   sought replies from the central and state governments. 
 
 The   said in his petition that the district authorities gave stone quarry leases to one A B S Antow and his relative S   in Kalkulam taluk, by violating the legal norms. Kalkulam is an important place in the district. There are many households and places of worship. As per norms, there should not be any quarry within a distance of 300m from residential houses. 
 
 When Antow and Vaithiyanathan had applied for stone quarries in Kalkulam taluk, the officials, the additional director of geology and mining, revenue divisional officer and two former tahsildars of Kalkulam, suppressed the fact of many households within the prescribed distance and gave false inspection report to the authorities.
