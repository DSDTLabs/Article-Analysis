UDAIPUR: For Kapil Meena, a fifth grader hailing from a nondescript village in Udaipur's tribal block, this was recognition beyond his wildest dreams. 

 Not only was his   Bharat-themed painting selected as one among the top three works in the country, Prime Minister   has also tweeted a congratulatory message, with Meena now all set to be felicitated by the PM on October 2 at a function in New Delhi.
 
 Meena, who hails from Phalasia village in Kherwada block of Udaipur, participated in the all-India painting competition held under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan on the theme, 'Clean India of My Dreams', in early September.
 
 His painting came first in the district and later won at the state level. The entry was widely appreciated at the national level and chosen among the best three paintings in the country on the Swachh Bharat theme. In his recent tweet, PM Modi wrote: "Through this prize winning painting Kapil Meena from Udaipur showcases how public participation can result in a clean village". Since the announcement, congratulations and rewards have rained on Meena from authorities and organizations. Udaipur collector Bishnu Charan Mallick and zila parishad CEO Avichal Chaturvedi have already felicitated the boy in their chambers.
 
 "In my painting, I have depicted a child engaged in plantation work while a few villagers are cleaning the area. There are hills, green trees and a river flowing in between the village. There is a dustbin outside a house," Meena told TOI.
 
 "People are healthy and happy in the painting because there is cleanliness around. This is the India of my dreams," the boy said wearing a confident smile.
 
 Meena's teachers too said the boy was a bright and active student. "He is very particular on sanitation and takes keen interest in voluntary work organized by the school. He is always neat and tidy and, despite being only a kid, advices and inspires other children to remain clean," Sangita Goswami, his class teacher, said.
