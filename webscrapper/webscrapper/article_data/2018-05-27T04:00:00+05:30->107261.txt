Rajkot: At least half-a-dozen lions have made a farm adjoining Mitiyala Sanctuary their home since Saturday morning. They had come out of forest area after a massive fire broke out in the Mitiyala Sanctuary Thursday late evening. According to source in the forest department, the fire was brought under control by Friday evening. However, smoke continued to billow from the forest. “When fire breaks out it becomes difficult for the animals and birds to survive as the oxygen decreased drastically,” said a forest officer.  A local villager Kamlesh Patel said, “The fire broke out on the north side of the forest which is near Khmbha taluka. To escape from the fire about six lions came to western side of Mitiyala Sanctuary. They are campaigning in agriculture land since Saturday morning. Some villagers also came to see the lions sitting in farm land. They are still moving in the same area and have not gone back to forest.” Locals alleged that this is the third time fire broke out in two months time in the forest area.
