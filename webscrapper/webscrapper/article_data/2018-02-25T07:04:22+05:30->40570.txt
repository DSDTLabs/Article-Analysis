AHMEDABAD: How do you prepare for disasters on the scale of 9/11? You stick to the script and do your best, says Dr Dario  , associate medical director of the Fire Department of New York (FDNY), who was closely associated with emergency work following the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York, which changed how the world looks at man-made disasters.

 “Our first response was: ‘It’s not real, it’s not happening’. The biggest challenge was, what do you do when you lose your command structure and key people. On a single day, we lost 343 firefighters. From my experience, I can say that with adequate training, you can manage 80% of the situation, for the rest, you have to improvise on the spot,” he said.
 
 Gonzalez is in Ahmedabad to deliver a lecture as part of the National   Conference.
 
 “In the aftermath, coordination between agencies such as the police, fire department and emergency medical services (EMS) has improved as they understand how other departments function. The command structure for any large-scale disaster is always tricky across the globe. Answers to questions such as who will be in-charge, who will do what, how will they coordinate have to be clearly decided,” he said.
 
 Not alien to the state and city, Gonzalez said he has been saying for years that India has to devise its own model based on local road conditions, population, infrastructure and laws instead of adopting models from the US, the UK or Australia.
 
 “Bringing in equipment used in another country might not serve the purpose. On a previous visit, I learned that someone lost their life when they was 9km from the hospital. Bigger or faster vehicles may not be the solution, one could look at sleeker, smaller vehicles which can move quickly,” said Gonzalez.
 
 He also stressed on the use of technology, such as video conferencing with doctors inside ambulances and smaller but more efficient medical centres, where patients can be sent quickly.
