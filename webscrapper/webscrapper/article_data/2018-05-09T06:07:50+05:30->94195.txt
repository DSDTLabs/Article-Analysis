Dealing yet another blow to deposed Pakistan Prime Minister  , the country’s anti-graft watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau, on Tuesday ordered an inquiry against him for allegedly laundering $4.9 billion to India.

 
 A NAB statement said bureau chairman Justice   (Retd) has taken notice of a media report claiming that the incident was mentioned in World Bank’s Migration and Remittances Book 2016. The statement, however, has not mentioned details of the media report in question. The press release claimed, “The amount was laundered to the Indian finance ministry after which Indian foreign exchange reserves witnessed an increase while Pakistan had suffered as a result.”
 
  
 
 
 However, in a press release issued on September 21, 2016, the   (SBP) had rejected the estimates of $4.9 billion remittances from Pakistan to India and had termed it contrary to facts.
 
 SBP said the outflow of $4.9 billion was cited in the Migration and Remittances Fact Book 2016, prepared by the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development. “It must be noted that the Fact Book data suggests estimates (not actual flows), which are based on a number of assumptions,” it said.
 
 The SBP said the data of balance of payments showed that $116,000 worth of worker remittances flew from Pakistan to India in FY16 and inflows from India to Pakistan stood at $329,000.
 
 The NAB probe comes as a setback to Sharif, who had to quit as PM following the SC verdict in the   Papers case that had disqualified him from office in July 2017. Sharif is not only facing three corruption cases, but the NAB also initiated a probe against him for alleged illegal expansion of a road leading to his estate in  . Once formulated, it will be his fifth NAB case.
 
 The accountability court on Tuesday sought more time from the Pakistan SC to end the trial on references filed by the NAB against members of the Sharif family.
