Ludhiana: Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairman, Punjab State Farmer’s Commission (PSFC) visited Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Gadvasu) on Wednesday, and held a meeting with vice-chancellor Dr Amarjit Singh Nanda, deans, directors, and HoDs of the varsity. The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the development of a new agriculture policy for Punjab. The meeting focused mainly on how livestock, poultry, and fisheries can be included in the new agriculture policy.

 Speaking on the occasion, Jakhar said: “After developing a draft of this new policy, we would present it in the Punjab assembly for open deliberation and views. We will also invite opinions from different quarters, which may be beneficial for the policy. Even a small farmer may present his ideas. Policy is mainly connected with the livelihood of the masses, so the policy document will be in a simple and understandable language. After developing the policy, the state government will honour it in the right spirit and take care of all the relevant needs, including the budget aspect.”
 
 Meanwhile, Dr Nanda emphasized the importance of the agriculture policy, which would help farmers in making livestock sustainable and profitable. He said it would bring in livestock security, make it a viable option for the state’s unemployed youth, and attract them to the livestock sector. Dr Simrat Sagar Singh, dean, Post-graduate Studies; Dr JPS Gill, director of Research; Dr Harish Kumar Verma, director of Extension Education; and others were also present in the meeting.​
