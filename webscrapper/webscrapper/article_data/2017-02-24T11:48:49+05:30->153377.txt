Thapki asks Bani to wake up and go for her tuitions. Bani pretends to be ill and asks her if she can skip it today. She tells Thapki that she isn't feeling well and might have fever. Thapki tells Bani that even she won't go to work but Bani insists her to.
 
  As soon as Thapki leaves, Bani asks Bihaan and Tina to come out as they were hiding under the bed. Bani and Tina ask Bihaan to play with them.
  
  Preeti and Suman are talking about how Thapki didn't talk to them properly. Then they realise that it would have been Shraddha who must have done something fishy as usual.
  
  The two are talking about Shraddha when she enters the room and taunts them.
  
  Bani, Tina and Bihaan are playing when Thapki comes back from work. The door gets locked and Bihaan and Tina hide in the scarecrow.
  
  Shraddha comes and asks Thapki about Bihaan and Tina.
  
  In the night, Bihaan enters Thapki's room and watches her sleep. When he is about to leave, Thapki wakes up with the sound of the door and thinks it is a thief.
  
  As soon she she switches on the light, she sees Bihaan and Tina and gets shocked.
