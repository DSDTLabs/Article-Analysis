A homebuyer admitted that the ambulance was stuck in the jam. “Some homebuyers and police personnel later cleared the road and the ambulance passed. We do not know whether the patient died,” he said. 
 
 Satish Chandra, SHO, Expressway police station, said that a police team had reached the spot to clear the road. “We dispersed the protesters and cleared the stretch. But we did not know about the death. We received the information of the death through unconfirmed sources,” Chandra said.
