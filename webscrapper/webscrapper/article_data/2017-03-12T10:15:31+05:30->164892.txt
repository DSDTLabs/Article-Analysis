BATHINDA: Till a couple of months ago, he was fighting for jobs to unemployed linemen. On Saturday, he became the representative of close to two lakh people of Bhadaur assembly constituency in Barnala district. Representing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Pirmal Singh Khalsa the seat by defeating four-time SAD MLA Balbir Singh Ghunas with 20,784 votes.

 Before joining AAP in late 2016, Pirmal, 37, was the president of Punjab Unemployed Linemen Union and fighting a prolonged battle for jobs to 4,000 unemployed linemen in the state. He did a two-year course of an electrician from Industrial Training Institute, Dehradun, and then two-year apprenticeship for linemen from Mandi Gobindgarh in 2006. Soon after, he started his protest for job, which continued till he joined AAP.
 
 During these 10 years, he succeeded in getting a job along with 1,000 others. However, he continued to protest for 3,000 unemployed linemen and lost his job for taking part in the struggle. He caught the attention of AAP in 2016, when he sat on fast unto death in Patiala for 29 days.
 
 “I am not a politician but a struggler. It is AAP, which offered me party ticket from Bhadaur (reserve) assembly segment. I decided to raise voice of the unemployed from a bigger platform and joined the political bandwagon,” Pirmal told TOI after his victory. 
 
 “I will keep on fighting for the cause in the state assembly and will remind the Congress government about its promise of jobs in every household. I will do whatever I can to force the government to implement its promise made to youths,” he said.
