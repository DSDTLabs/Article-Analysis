PUNE: The   police has booked a skilled labourer employed by the   for allegedly molesting a nurse of the primary health centre (PHC) on the varsity premises. 

 Senior inspector   of the Chatushrungi police said the molestation had occurred in March last year, after which the 39-year-old nurse had submitted a complaint application to the police. She had requested the police not to register an offence because the university authorities had constituted an inquiry committee to probe the issue, Dhome said.
 
 As the varsity committee is yet to submit its report, the nurse thought she would not get justice. She then approached the police and requested to file a complaint against the skilled labourer, Dhome said. "We have booked the suspect," Dhome said.
 
 The nurse staying on the university campus is employed with the PHC for the past 10 years. On the day of the molestation, she was alone at the PHC.
 
  The suspect looked at her and made obscene gestures. He then used offensive language and molested her at the health centre.
