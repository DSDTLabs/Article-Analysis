After re-entering the show ' ' as the antagonist,   is now set to join ' ' ('DSDT'). We hear it will be a cameo, where he will be back to doing what he does best — romancing the heroine! He will be seen opposite  . 

 Interestingly, the character on the show has been named Iqbal, too. “After the narration, I asked the producers for the name of the character and they said it’s Iqbal,” he laughs, adding, “It’s a positive character, something like that of Salman Khan in 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' with Irrfan’s mannerisms in 'Hindi Medium'. It’s always interesting to romance on screen as it connects with the audience instantly. There has to be a dose of drama, but mushy moments lend a feel-good factor to a show.”
 
 So, will the reel Iqbal romance the girl like he does in real life? “That happens with every character after a while. You tend to recreate emotions, be it romance or happiness, from your real-life experiences. Everything can’t be written. Magical scenes happen in between those lines.”
 
 Interestingly, the actor was to step into Sidharth Shukla’s shoes to play the new Parth in 'DSDT' in December, last year. However he had to bow out of the project as the deal took long to materialise and he had taken up another offer by then.   was roped in as the new hero instead.
