Police chiefs of all districts have constituted   and in Lucknow, six police jeeps were deployed outside educational institutes to check harassment of females on Tuesday.

 “We will continue to check crowding outside educational institutes,” said additional director general (law and order) Daljeet Singh Chawdhary. In NCR, district police chiefs of Ghaziabad and Noida suspended scores of policemen for negligence, not working out pending cases and in some instances for harbouring criminals. “Complaints against tainted policemen are brought to the notice of senior officials but they swung into action soon after new government took charge,” said high court advocate Rohit Kant.
 
 Following up on   government’s directives to ensure complete communal harmony, instructions were given on Tuesday to all policemen to brace up for Chaitra Navratra well in advance. As processions are taken out during Navratra, the department is busy identifying trouble spots where tension was reported in past.
 
 Chawdhary insisted such steps had been taken earlier too. “Due to elections, action against erring policemen could not be initiated,” he said, explaining the disciplinary action in Noida and Ghaziabad.
