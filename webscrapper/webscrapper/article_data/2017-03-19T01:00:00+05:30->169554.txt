SAMASTIPUR: Teachers of affiliated colleges and schools and those working on contract in government schools did not allow evaluation of answer books of Intermediate examinations for the fourth consecutive day on Saturday. 

 The teachers staged dharna and shouted slogans at the three evaluation centres –  , R N A R College and R S B Inter School. 
 
 District president of Vittarahit Sanyukta Sangharsh Morcha Umesh Kumar said they expected a lot from CM Nitish Kumar, but he failed to deliver. “The government has pushed the teachers of affiliated colleges to the brink of starvation by denying them their wages,” he said.
 
 Several other teachers taking part in the protest vowed to fight to the last for justice. Officials in these colleges said they have informed higher authorities about the protest and would take necessary action once they receive guidance.
