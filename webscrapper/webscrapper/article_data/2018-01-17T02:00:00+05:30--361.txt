Nagpur: Mahindra finance company manager Mangesh Deshmukh, along with another accomplice Pitambar Ahirkar, has been slapped with charges of cheating and forgery following a complaint lodged by Aloke Shewale. The offence was registered at Ambazari police station on Monday. 

 Shewale had earlier shared his residential proof to his former friend-turned-foe Ahirkar after he had requested for the document to use it as a reference in the application of his vehicle loan in 2015. The residential proof was later used by Ahirkar to fraudulently present Shewale as a guarantor of the loan of Rs4.75 lakh which was sanctioned by the Mahindra Finance company too.
 
 Shewale has also claimed in the complaint that Ahirkar had also forged his signature to get the loan sanctioned with the so-called connivance of Deshmukh. The matter had come to fore before Shewale after he got a notice from the finance company related to the loan. Stunned by the reference of his name mentioned in the notice as a guarantor, Shewale had earlier approached the finance company but later filed a complaint with the Ambazari police station.
 
 As the cops were reluctant to register the offence and probe it, Shewale approached the court with the plea to get the offence registered. It was following the courtâ€™s intervention that an offence was registered against Ahirkar and Deshmukh.
