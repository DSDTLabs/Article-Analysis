LUCKNOW: The well-oiled election management machinery of the ruling   is giving a hard time to   in the   elections. 

 With Naresh Agarwal joining   with his MLA son Nitin Agarwal in tow, chances of BSP win have further dimmed.
 
 Already having 28 spare votes, BJP is pinning hopes on four Independent MLAs and the black sheep in opposition for winning another seat which would increase the treasury bench strength in Rajya Sabha where it still does not have a majority. 
 
 In contrast, BSP has very little to manoeuvre as it already has full support of Congress and SP.
 
 Hectic lobbying has been going on within the parties for RS elections in the state. Till three more BJP candidates filed their nomination on Monday, BSP was hoping of a smooth sailing for its candidate since it has 19 MLAs of its own, seven of Congress, 10 spare votes of SP and one from RLD.
 
 But since voting is inevitable now, BJP will leave no stone unturned to win a ninth seat. BJP has already set its eyes on four independent MLAs who can take its tally to 32. After adding Nitin Agarwal, the party needs just four more MLAs.
 
 BJP's election strategists are sending feelers to one Samajwadi MLA who is in jail, while talks are on with two others also from SP, one from   community and the other a Rajput.
 
 In contrast, BSP is at a disadvantage as party supremo   has still not formed any team for RS elections. "BJP machinery is well-oiled and being in power it is in a better position to pluck MLAs from rival parties as it did for legislative council seats last year," lamented a senior BSP functionary.
