PUNE: As many as 480 women, including 25 from foreign countries, have enrolled for uterus transplant procedures ever since doctors from Pune performed the country’s first such uterine transplants last year. 

 “These 480 women are at different stages of evaluation. About 30% are up for immediate surgery, provided their paperwork is complete,” transplant surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar, medical director of   in Pune, said.
 
 The doctors carried out three more uterus transplants within a year. “ The three transplants were on January 26, April 8 and April 9, 2018. All three women have recovered well and are scheduled for the next phase of treatment,” Puntambekar added.
 
 The women included a 32-year-old from Karnataka, a 30-year-old from Gujarat and a 24-year-old from Bihar.
 
 “All three have congenital absence of uterus. The donors in all three cases are their mothers. We have removed the uteri from the donors laparoscopically,” Puntambekar said.
 
 “We are in the process of standardising the procedure and have proved that India can do it. Our extensive experience in performing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and understanding the anatomy helped,” he added.
 
 The hospital’s gynaecologists Milind Telang and   said, “We have published the transplant techniques and the scientific papers on our uterine transplant in peer-reviewed medical journals. It has made it possible for other surgeons to duplicate the procedure. It is our greatest strength. We have also reduced the time of the transplant to six hours as compared to the West where doctors take 10 hours.”
