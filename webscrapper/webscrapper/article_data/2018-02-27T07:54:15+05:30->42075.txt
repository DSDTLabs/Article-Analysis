VADODARA: A woman working for a pharmaceutical company in   was allegedly cheated by a small-time builder at Wadi. The accused   sold an apartment to the complainant Kajal   which was owned by somebody else and when the accusedâ€™s lie was caught by Soni, he refused to return her Rs 1.5 lakh which she had given as token amount.

 In 2017, Soni was living in a rented house with her husband and two kids. She approached Godgaste, who lived near her house, since she wanted to buy a house of her own. Godgaste told Soni that he has an apartment near Wadi tower and was planning to sell it. After seeing the apartment, Soni showed readiness to buy it for Rs 7 lakh.
 
 She paid Rs 1.5 lakh to Godgaste as token amount following which he gave the house keys to her and a bill of sale. It was then decided that when Soni will pay the remaining amount, they will sign the sale deed.
 
 After some months Soni applied for home loan from a bank, but she learnt from the bank that the house was owned by one Bhavesh Bhusad and the apartment was already mortgaged for a loan taken by Bhusad. When Soni asked Godgaste about it, he said that he will sort it out which did not happen. Later when Soni asked the accused to return the money she gave him, Godgaste refused.
 
 Soni lodged complaint with Panigate police on the basis of which cops booked Godgaste for cheating and planning criminal conspiracy.
