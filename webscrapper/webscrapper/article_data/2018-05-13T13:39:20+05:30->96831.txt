INDORE: The local   is facing   of   vaccines (ARV injections) as it does not have funds to purchase them. Over 50 cases of dog bites are reported daily at government-run clinics.

 “At Hukumchand Polyclinic, there is a requirement of 200-250 ARV injections in a day as we record around 50-60 cases of dog bites daily. We need to maintain a stock of three days of these life-saving medicines. At present, we have stock of just one day,” polyclinic in-charge Dr Ashutosh Sharma told TOI.
 
 “We have informed civil surgeon and chief medical and health officer (CMHO) about the scarcity of this life saving medicine and have asked them to make adequate supply available at the earliest,” he said.
 
 Civil surgeon Dr MS Mandloi said, “A delay in issuing budget under head of purchasing medicines, (which was expected to come in April), has resulted in shortage of ARV. We have asked state government to sanction a separate budget of Rs 30 lakh to purchase ARV for the year.”
 
 He said that till the time government sanctions the budget, they had received collector’s sanction to purchase these injections from Rogi Kalyan Samiti (patient welfare committee).
 
 According to experts, in case a person is bitten by a rabid dog, he/she should be injected with ARV within seven days. If that is not done, chances are that the person may be develop rabies infection, which may even result in death.
 
 “We do not know if a patient is bitten by a rabid dog or not and as such, in every case of a dog bite, ARV should be administered,” Dr Sharma said.
 
 He said that Indore, which had stood at second spot after Kolkata in reporting number of dog bite cases (as per data of Anti-Rabies Clinic released in 2017), has now witnessed a considerable drop in such cases due to public awareness. The city however still ranks among top ten cities facing dog menace.
