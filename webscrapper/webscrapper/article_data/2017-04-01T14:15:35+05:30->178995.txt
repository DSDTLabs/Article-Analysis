NASHIK: The police department and the   (RTO) remain indifferent as autorickshaw drivers charge exorbitant fares and refuse to ply by the meter. 

 Almost all autorickshaws in the city come with a written statement on the back of their vehicle, which reads that the autorickshaw operates by the meter. None of them, however, practices this and a passengers end up paying anywhere between Rs150-200 for a 5-km distance.
 
 The situation gets worse from midnight to 5am, when drivers charge whatever they want knowing that the passenger is hard pressed and without any option.
 
 A few years ago, the Nashik RTO and the city police had started a prepaid booth at the   bus stand. But, this initiative didn’t take off with the booth remains shut most of the time. 
 
 Aniket Gumbade, a college student from  , said, “An autorickshaw driver at the Nashik Road railway station demands anything from Rs 250-275 to reach me home. The driver may finally settle at Rs 225 after some hard bargaining. A radio cab only charges around Rs 170. The only thing is that one is forced to walk hauling his luggage as the autorickshaw drivers refuse to allow the   near the railway premises.”
 
 Autorickshaw unions have stated that drivers want to ply by the meter, but passengers do not want this. 
 
 Archana Shinde, a homemaker, said the fares charged by autorickshaw drivers are reasonable. “Those who can’t afford wait for ST buses. My only complaint is that the authorities should make the autorickshaw drivers seat only three passengers per trip” she said. 
 
 Transport commissioner Pravin Gedam said, “I will soon be talking to the RTO officials at Nashik and ensure that they initiate stringent measures to see that autorickshaws start plying by meter.”
