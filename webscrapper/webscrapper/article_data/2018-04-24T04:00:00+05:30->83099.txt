Vadodara: Chances that the vegetable market inaugurated in Gorwa nearly a year back to be put to use look slim. 

 The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has once again decided to change the policy for the allocation of spaces in the market. VMC had constructed the market after razing the existing one. The civic body has been discussing various modes to give shops to the vegetable vendors but has not reached a conclusion yet.
 
 The civic body had initially passed a proposal to give priority to 116 vendors whose list had been submitted by the vendor themselves to the Gujarat high court in a petition. The remaining 50 spaces in the market were to be auctioned and the average rent obtained in the auction was to be charged from these 116 vendors.
 
 But recently it was decided that an open auction will be conducted and vegetable vendors of ward 10 where the market is located as well as those who were ousted would be able to participate in the auction. The issue was discussed recently in a coordination committee of the VMC that was also attended by elected representatives. The VMC was again asked to give priority to the 116 vendors and only then auction the remaining outlets.
 
 The civic body has now come up with a fresh advertisement that gives priority to the 116 vendors. Opposition Ranstriya Samaj Paksha corporator Rajesh Ayre, meanwhile, demanded that all outlets should be auctioned.
