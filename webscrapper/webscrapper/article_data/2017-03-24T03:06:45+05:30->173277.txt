GURUGRAM: Power   DHBVN has assured that it would reduce power outages this year as compared to the last, even as the city continues to reel under prolonged   with the onset of summer.

 DHBVN officials said they have   the   substantially in a bid to ensure that the power crises faced by the residents are not as bad as that of the last year. Outages as long as 5-6 hours were routine across   last year. 
 
 And this year too, residents continue to suffer from prolonged power cuts extending up to two hours or even more daily. South City and sectors 3, 5, 6 14 and 56 are among some parts of Gurgaon plagued with the menace. 
 
 “We are facing power outages in spring. I can’t imagine how the summer is going to pan out for us,” said Sudhir Bhardwaj, RWA president of Sector 56, adding that the situation was worse in the Huda plots.
 
 Discom’s junior engineer Harjinder Singh, however, denied enforcing long-duration outages. “Residents have been facing power cuts for short duration in lieu of   work being carried out,” he said. Aakanksha Singh from South City 1 said. “I have a five-year old autistic daughter, who is not used to the hot climate. Whenever the power goes off, she gets flustered. I end up checking into the nearby hotels, which costs me Rs 1,300 for every booking.”
 
 Meanwhile, superintendent engineer Naveen Verma told TOI that discom is currently carrying maintenance work for all the 11 kV feeders on the war-footing. “ This year, there will be fewer outages as our system is well maintained and we have enough supply to cater to the increased demand.”
