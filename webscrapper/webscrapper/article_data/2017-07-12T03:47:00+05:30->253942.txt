Panaji: Citizens travelling by   along the Panaji-Betim route have been inconvenienced as a lone vessel has been plying the course for the past week. Rain, coupled with traffic congestion on the Mandovi bridges due to the ongoing construction of the third bridge, has left several commuters with no option but to put up with the poor ferry services.

 “I usually end up waiting for more than 30 minutes for the ferry to arrive. Very often, it’s during heavy showers. Being a government-operated jetty, there should at least be some sort of shelter on the premises for those waiting,” said regular commuter, Robert Souza.
 
 Verem resident Rama Naik said many passengers are forced to wait for a subsequent trip during peak hours. “One ferry can accommodate only so many. Some take the bridge due to this, but even the occasional traffic jams there delay us,” he said.
 
 Even the staff managing the lone vessel, called Dudhsagar, expressed their displeasure and helplessness at having only one ferry at their disposal.
 
 “We can’t increase the ferry’s speed due to the manner in which the floating casinos are stationed in the river. Moreover, the movement of commuters is chaotic. There is an urgent need to deploy traffic police at jetties on either side of the river to manoeuvre vehicles and passengers,” a staff member said.
 
 While two ferries operate during the morning to meet rush hour demand, post 11am and all through the second half of the day, a single ferry is forced to manage the passage of people. 
 
 Sources close to the state river navigation department (RND) said routine repairs of the existing ferries have been keeping the regular ones off course.
 
 “There have been a few issues with ferries that require minor repairs. We take them off course in the second half of the day and put them back on track the next morning,” the source said.
