GANDHINAGAR: OBC leader  ,the founder of OBC, SC, ST Ekta Manch is keeping political parties guessing as to his final allegiance in the upcoming assembly polls. 

 He has announced that he will publicly announce his decision on October 9, but speculations are rife as his recent moves to make a deal with BJP seem to have lost force. So, his chances of joining   or backing another forum is not being ruled out.
 
 Sources in BJP leadership said the party was not comfortable with Thakor’s demands and was yet to take a call.
 
 “After meeting Amit Shah, Thakor had said he will formally join BJP, but has now changed his stand. He is demanding minimum 18 to 20 seats, as well as a key position for himself in the party,” a senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.
 
 The BJP leader added, “If Thakor joins BJP it will certainly give us a shot in the arm, but if he doesn’t, it will not make much difference as most voters in his community are traditionally inclined towards Congress.”
 
 He said, “We have a plan B ready to counter   in case he joins Congress or any other platform.”
 
 If key sources in Alpesh’s OSS Ekta Manch's core team are to be believed, Alpesh is keen to join BJP, but on his terms. “If BJP agrees to his demands, only then he will announce support on October 9,” a close aide of Thakor said. Alpesh Thakor was approached several times for his comments. However, he was not available.
