MUMBAI: Two hearing- and speech-impaired men were convicted on Friday of the murder of a 55-year-old woman in   during a robbery in 2013.

 
 The sentence against Saifraza  , 31, and  , 33, is likely to be pronounced on Monday by the sessions court after arguments on the quantum of sentence. The court has called for an interpreter to help communicate their likely plea for leniency.
 
 The body of Nalini   was found in a pool of blood by her husband in their 10th-floor flat at   building in Bandra (West) on June 11, 2013. The accused have been in jail since their prompt arrest on June 12, 2013.
 
 The police said Bhavnagari was friends with Chainani’s son and often visited the family.  , a trainer at a Bandra gym, knew the family through Bhavnagari. On June 11, the duo came to meet Chainani and she unsuspectingly invited them in. As she went to make juice, they attacked her with a razor and snatched the earrings, bangles and other ornaments she was wearing. They fled with the loot worth Rs 6 lakh, but left behind a phone.
 
 It gave them away and the cops arrested them the next day. The two accused had used the phone to SMS each other before committing the murder. Cops had to take the help of their families to communicate with them during investigation.
 
 The trial proved difficult because of their handicap, and finally last October, they deposed through sign language. With no interpreter turning up, Bhavnagar’s mother and Khan’s father played the role. The family members also helped the accused answer a questionnaire prepared by the court.
 
 On Monday, after the verdict was pronounced, Bhavnagari’s mother broke down even as the two looked shocked and remained stoic.
 
 In his son’s defence, Khan’s father had told the court: “My son can’t speak and hear from his birth. He is not educated. He cannot operate a mobile phone. I have not seen him using a mobile phone.”
