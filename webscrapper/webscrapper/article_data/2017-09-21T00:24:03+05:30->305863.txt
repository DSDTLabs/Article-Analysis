Coimbatore: The ongoing construction work to install a new canopy at the airport here will be completed within three months, airport director R Mahalingam said. “Once the work is over, passengers will be able to walk under its shade from where they get off from their cars till the airport entrance,” he told TOI on Wednesday.

 Five pre-fabricated pillars for the canopy have already been erected. “About 15 more steel pillars will be erected soon. They have arrived and are being pre-fabricated. But, the work is taking awhile because of constant passenger movement and forced pauses,” he said. The canopy fabric will be simultaneously fitted every time a pillar is erected, the official added.
 
 The work for erecting the canopy, measuring around 175m x 30m, had begun in April.
 
 Meanwhile, many passengers are a little concerned about the construction work at the busy place. They are made to alight from vehicles a little away from the entrance due to the ongoing work. Due to this, they have been complaining about having to walk through the din and dust before entering the facility. 
 
 “Also, new passengers find it a little difficult to find the way to the entrance, because different parts of the frontage are closed off. With heavy rain hitting the city, we are not only getting wet, but slightly messy too,” said KP Jayanth, a regular flyer from the city.
