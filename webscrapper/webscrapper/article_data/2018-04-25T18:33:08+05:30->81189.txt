 calls Bagga and tells him to meet them at 12 am. After the call,   asks the former how they will leave their house as they won’t be allowed to go by their parents. Tapu suggests an excuse that won’t be countered by them. They decide to tell their parents that they have to go for the night cricket tournament at the Gandhi maidan so they can learn the game better by observing it.

  brings an ice-cream for his father, Dr. Hathi. He thanks him but Komal intervenes and asks about the special occasion. Goli then tells them that he needs their permission to go to the night cricket tournament. After a little hesitation, they agree. Elsewhere, even Gogi talks to his parents and tells them the same. They do not agree initially but Gogi tells his mother that even Goli and Tapu would be with him, which makes them give their consent. When Sodhi tells him that he will also join them, Gogi asks him not to, as other kids would make fun of him.
 
  
  
 
 Gogi and Goli inform Tapu that they have sought permission from their parents. Tapu thinks it is his turn. He calls his father (Jethalal) and Dada Ji for dinner. While coming out of their room, Jetha and Dada Ji collide. They then seat themselves at the dinner table and Jetha is very happy that Tapu has set the table on his own. Tapu thinks his father is happy today so he should ask him to let him go at night. He then gives the same excuse to them, but Jethalal refuses to let him go. He tells Tapu he feels he is lying. But Dada Ji tells Jetha that he trusts Tapu more than anyone else. They both grant permission to him. 
 
 At night, Gogi, Goli and Tapu talk over the phone and leave their house. On the way, Popat spots them and asks them where they are going so late at night. They tell him they are going to the Gandhi maidan to watch the cricket tournament. Popat doubts them, which leaves the three nervous. But then they manage to convince him and leave.
