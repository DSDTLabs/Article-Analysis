Nagpur: In a first, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has successfully devised a unique technique to deal with disposal of plastic waste. The plastic waste generated in the Orange City will be used in the construction of asphalt roads. On Tuesday, the civic body has started a pilot project for constructing a patch of road using plastic waste in Bhandewadi dumping yard for the purpose of laying of roads.

 “We are testing the durability of using tar mixed with plastic granules for surface of roads and 50 meter stretch of road in Bhandewadi itself being used for the purpose,” confirmed municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar. “There is always the concern of reusing plastic. Through this project we are hoping to address dual issue i.e. to reuse plastic and undertake road laying work which should be lasting and economical,” said the civic chief.
 
 Nagpur generates between 1,000 and 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage every day, which include almost 50 tonnes of plastic wastes. Using of plastic wastes will reduce cost of road tarring by almost 10%, said Hardikar.
 
 The entire process is very simple. The plastic waste material, including plastic carry-bags, plastic cups, plastic packaging are shredded to a particular size using a shredding machine.
 
 It gets coated uniformly over the aggregate, giving an oily look. The plastic waste coated aggregate is mixed with hot bitumen and the resulting mix is used for road construction. The road laying temperature is between 110°c and 120°c, explained an official from hotmix department. Roads layer using plastic is stated to be having high resistance from damages as well as restrict water percolation a major factor for potholes. Presently work is going on in front of water hydrant in Bhandewadi.
