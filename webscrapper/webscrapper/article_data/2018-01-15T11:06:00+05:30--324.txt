LUDHIANA: At a time when several initiatives are being taken under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship cleanliness initiative Swachh Bharat Mission, the residents of Model Town extension have to bear the foul smell emanating from the heaps of garbage, which has been lying here for a long time. The residents complained that officials of MC Ludhiana haven’t done anything to get rid of the smell. 

 “I cross this path almost regularly. MC officials have done nothing to clear this mess. I have been seeing this pile of garbage for the last nine months now,” said  , resident of Dugri.
 
 Another resident Jasleen Kaur, who lives nearby, said, “Garbage from all the houses of Model Town extension is thrown here. Not only do the residents throw the garbage, but also the vegetable and fruit sellers throw their waste here.”
 
 Rupinder Kaur, a resident of Model Town extension, said they have made several complaints with the MC officials but no solution has been found. “This area has become a dump yard with people throwing all the household waste here,” said Kaur. 
 
 Preet Kaur, a resident of Civil Lines, said, “Look at this area? Can be become a smart city if we continue to throw garbage in this manner. The pile of waste spoils the beauty of the road. Also, the waste can bring about a lot of health-related issues. Animals, too, feed on the waste,” said Kaur.
 
 The residents complained that even though the MC officials have put up boards, which say ‘Clean city, Green city’, the civic body authorities have hardly done anything to keep the area clean.
 
 “I am seeing this garbage lying here since the last one year and no action has been taken. Ludhiana is such a popular city and this kind of mess is bringing shame to the city,” said  , a resident of Model Town.
