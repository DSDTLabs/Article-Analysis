MOHALI: Hold tight, it's a bumpy ride! Dotted with 3-inch-deep potholes, the city's new roads have become the dread of two-wheeler riders, who have taken many a tumble. 

 The newest surface-the 200-foot-wide road connecting the airport with Balongi near Kharar-has the maximum dents. Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) blew up crores of rupees on laying this road, which by its own admission, carries 25,000 vehicles a day.
 
 The drivers approaching the Radha Soami Satsang   from the Industrial Area can spot these humps before the SCL (Semi-Conductor Laboratory) roundabout, besides near the Sohana gurdwara and on the dividing road of Sectors 68 and 82 opposite the Indian School of Business (ISB). 
 
 The road opposite NIPER (National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research), and the sections at the White House crossing and Phase-11 traffic lights are riddled with dangerous potholes.   Gurdeep Singh survived a nightmare at the SCL roundabout last week, when on his way home with family, his car tyre burst upon hitting a pothole. "I had to spend Rs 10,000 to get a new tyre and a rim," he said. It's two-wheeler riders who are at maximum risk. Since many software companies are based in Industrial Area Phase 8-B, their employees are forced to take his road.
 
  One of them,  , recalls a nasty fall. "The impact of hitting a pothole on the Radha Soami Satsang traffic junction threw me off my motorcycle. I was lucky to have no other vehicle behind because of late night, or the accident could have been fatal." GMADA chief administrator   said he had directed the executive engineer to take stock of the potholes and get these repaired. "The superintending engineer will submit a report about the damaged roads," he said.
