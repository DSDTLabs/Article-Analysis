CHANDIGARH: Two days after the   (PU) syndicate gave its nod to 10%   for the ongoing classes and 5% for the fresh admissions,   ( ) on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to PU vice-chancellor demanding the rollback of the fee hike. 

 Condemning the action, the memorandum stated, "NSUI fully opposes the proposed fee hike. Punjab government has started providing an enhanced grant to our university. The income of the university has certainly increased significantly in this session." The memorandum concluded with a request to rollback the proposed fee hike and to "not put any financial burden on the student' fraternity."  , national social media coordinator, NSUI, said they hope the PU authorities will reconsider the move. "We want them to set fixed criteria for the annual fee increment," he said. He criticised the sporadic increase of fees on no logical grounds. "We are awaiting an immediate response else, we will start protesting Monday onwards," he said.
 
 The current student council of the university has three members from NSUI. Other student organisations have also opposed the hike. However, no other organization has launched any kind of protest so far. Last year, after the fee hike, violence had erupted on the campus on April 11. Now, the PU senate will take up the matter for final approval.
