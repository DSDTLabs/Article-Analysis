VISAKHAPATNAM/VIZIANAGARAM: Vizianagaram collector   said 50 summer sports camps would be held in various parts of the district for the first time. 

 Inaugurating the first summer tennis camp at the revamped Sir Vizzy Stadium, Yadav said sports camps would be conducted in 50 major panchayats and mandal headquarters and over 22 sports would be covered. Focus in rural areas would be on athletics, he said.
 
 The collector urged the 30 participants to make the most of the opportunity in the month-long camp. 
 
 “Vizianagaram used to host international ranking tournaments on dung courts at the Vizianagaram club. Today, Vizianagaram has its own synthetic courts and the youngsters participating in the camp must make the most of it. Hopefully, we will have our own champion players in the future,” Yadav said. 
 
 Tennis coach   said, “A lot of importance is now being given to promotion and development of sports infrastructure in Vizianagaram town and district. Unless and until the infrastructure is available, some sports will never see talent emerging from the working classes.” 
 
 The collector urged the coaching staff and organisers to organise regular talent hunts in the district to boost the player pool in the district. The collector toured the rest of the stadium where other sporting summer camps such as skating and athletics were being held. He said importance would be given to tribal and agency areas as well, where there is a lot of unexplored talent.
