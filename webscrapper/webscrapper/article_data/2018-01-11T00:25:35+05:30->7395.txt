Panaji: Understandably, Ferran   didn’t need any lessons in  .
 
  The Spanish forward who has set the   ( ) on fire with nine goals in eight matches and two successive hat-tricks is FC Goa’s trump card this season. So when a group of die-hard fans decided to come up with a song dedicated to the team, they couldn’t do it without the man who has made Goans dream again.
  
  They approached the team management to spare a few players for the shoot, primarily  , and the big-hearted Spanish forward was among the first to show up.
  
  “We were waiting for the players to start our shoot when Coro turned up. He was all alone and said he was ready. We were surprised and tried explaining what we wanted from him. He picked that up instantly, telling us he knew what tiki taka is all about,” said H  , co-producer, musician and founding member of FC Goa Fan Club.
  
  The video for ‘Tiki Taka Vamos Goa’ was released on Tuesday night in Siridao in the presence of   – who also features in the video – Ahmed Jahouh, Edu Bedia and Sergio Juste, most of whom drove to the venue straight from training. The man many missed was Coro but the sight of him breaking into a dance, repeatedly, was the highlight of the launch.
  
  Other players who feature in the song include Portuguese defender Bruno Pinheiro, captain Laxmikant Kattimani and local favourite Mandar Rao Desai.
  
  ‘Tiki Taka Vamos Goa’ was played during the last home game at Fatorda and should be the focus again on Thursday. It’s a catchy song, just like ‘Ole Ole Viva Forca Goa’ from Kollective Soul – of which Omkar is a part -- last season, but the video with players making their presence felt makes it even better.
  
  “This song is a call to everyone to join the football revolution in Goa. We’ve consciously modelled it on tiki taka, the famous short-passing and movement game which FC Goa is now adopting,” said Omkar, who co-produced the song with   from Sanguem.
