KOLKATA: The clash of exam dates for   &   and   WBJEE, both of which are slated for April 23, has led to a   who are keen on joining the Army but also want to keep an   as their second career option.

 In spite of the hue and cry, the WBJEE Board is determined not to change the exam dates. “Back in October last year, we informed almost 55 examination conducting bodies about the test date,” said chairman Malayendu Saha.
 
 Such a candidate caught in a bind is a Class XII student at Sainik School in Purulia, Sourav Ghosh. “I want to be an engineer and was keen to take the two engineering exams. But since I am motivated to pursue a career in defence as well, I will have to make a choice. I think I will skip WBJEE this year,” Ghosh said. His friend, Sayantan Chakraborty, also had plans to sit for both the National Defence Academy & Naval Academy Examination and WBJEE. “I’m disappointed. I had thought if I could take the engineering entrance tests, there would have been a greater chance to succeed in the NDA examination. It would have done wonders to my confidence as well. But now, I will skip the WBJEE,” Chakraborty said.
 
 Col Rahul Sharma, principal of Purulia Sainik School that sends out one of the highest numbers of students for the NDA exam, opposed the move. “I feel students should get a fair chance to appear in all the examinations. Moreover, the NDA exam has an age bar, allowing candidates to take the test only within a certain age. Other exams rarely have such an age limit. Also, only a few boys from Bengal go into Army. Those few should not be discouraged by being put in such a dilemma,” Col Sharma said.
 
 Educationist Amal Mukhopadhyay called it “extremely unfortunate” that students should have to choose between two exams. “It is important to know if the JEE Board did request the authorities conducting the NDA exam to shift the date, which they should have done,” Mukhopadhyay said.
