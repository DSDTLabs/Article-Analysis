PATNA: Deputy CM   on Sunday said he would press for the inclusion of three Bihar cities – Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya – under the National   ( ) of the Centre that covers 96 cities in the country. The three Bihar cities had been left out despite having poor air quality.

 
 Modi said he would raise the issue at the one-day conference of the environment and forest ministers of all states to be held at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi on Monday. The conference is part of the national conference to be held to mark the World Environment Day on Tuesday.
 
 Modi said Union environment and forest minister Dr Harshvardhan and UN programme officer on environment Arik Solhein would address the conference of the states’ environment and forest ministers on Monday, while PM   would address the participants at the national conference on Tuesday.
 
 “The World Health Organisation report on air quality had put Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya under the category of worst air quality. The air quality of these cities had deviated hugely on the PM10 air pollution levels. However, the NCAP announced by the Centre had excluded the three Bihar cities,” Modi said.
 
 He added the NCAP would be implemented with an investment of Rs 637 crore and cover 96 cities of the country. “The programme proposes to take measures to control air pollution, increase the number of centres to measure air quality, conduct studies on the impact of poor environment on health and find the causes responsible for air pollution in the cities concerned,” Modi said.
