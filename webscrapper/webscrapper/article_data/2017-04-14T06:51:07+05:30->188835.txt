KOLKATA: The countdown has started and the excitement is palpable. Even though the weather is harsh, it doesn’t seem to have any effect on the festive spirit. 

 Thousands of Kolkatans are braving the heat to have their fill of shopping for the   new year that begins on Saturday. Malls and markets have been spilling over as the ‘Chaitra Sale’ reaches its last, frenetic leg. Restaurants are ready to roll out their best Bengali platter. Shops, on the other hand, are switching to new ‘haal khatas’, flagging off a fresh accounting year.
 
 The pavements in Gariahat are teeming with shoppers. Last-minute buying has scarcely been interrupted by the sudden spurt in temperature, said Debraj Ghosh of the   – the apex body of street vendors in the area. Up north, business has been brisk at Hatibagan. Shopping malls, too, have seen a bigger turnout this week.
 
 For Raisa Ghosh, a Dum Dum student,   means family time. “It’s also about wearing new clothes and having proper Bengali food,” she said. 
 
 There will be a lot on offer for foodies this weekend. Bengali cuisine restaurant 6 Ballygunge Place will, in fact, observe a Nababarsha weekend from Friday. On April 15, the restaurant will be rolling out a buffet for New Year revelers comprising five non-vegetarian dishes and four vegetarian items, including chingri bata and kumro bharta. The lunch can be rounded up with four varieties of desserts at Rs 1,100 plus taxes.
 
 For those with a sweet tooth, there will be a lot to savour this festive weekend. Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is ready with several new varieties of sandesh. “We will have Queso di pina – a mix of pineapple and cottage cheese — apart from Ambrosia and Elixir. That apart, we will have a whole range of ‘Nababarsha’ sandesh across a wide price range,” said Sudip Mullick, owner.
