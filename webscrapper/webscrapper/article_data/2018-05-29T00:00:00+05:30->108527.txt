The 10K   was back in the city on Sunday. The   was not just about running, but was also a platform for Bengalureans to express their views on recent events and showcase the causes that they support. This was done under the ‘Maja Run’. A lot of known faces, including politicos, took part in Bengaluru’s international marathon that started at Sree Kanteerava Stadium.

 
 
 Former tennis ace Mary Pierce was in Bengaluru recently as an ambassador of the 10K marathon. Mary says that she fell in love with the city for many reasons. One of the things that she liked was the weather, which she made full use of even with a run in the scenic Cubbon Park. Mary also said that she wanted to indulge in some shopping before she left the country, as she found the clothes very colourful and stylish. She was seen cheering the participants and winners on at the marathon, too.
