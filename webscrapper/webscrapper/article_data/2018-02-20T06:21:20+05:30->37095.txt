KOLKATA: The city woke up to a foggy morning on Monday with visibility dropping to 500m. The air quality, too, dropped with the particulate matter count climbing sharply to more than three times the permissible limit.

 A high-pressure zone above   infused moisture into the city leading to the  , said the Met office. It could remain foggy on Tuesday morning as well, it was predicted. Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 19.7°C on Monday.
 
 “Around two weeks ago, we had a similar high-pressure belt that had led to a thick fog in the city. It was less thicker on Monday, though and occurred in pockets of the city,” said G K Das, director, regional meteorological centre ( ). Experts said the fog helped to trap particulate matter at the lower levels of the atmosphere and pushed the PM 2.5 count up.
 
  
  
 Even though it was not alarmingly high, with the count touching 187 in the afternoon, the reading remained consistently high from early morning till noon. The ambient air quality, as recorded by the US Consulate’s air quality monitoring station on Monday, showed the PM2.5 count stayed three times above the permissible limit for too long a period from midnight to afternoon.
 
 At midnight on Sunday, the PM 2.5 count crossed 180 µg/m3 and stayed there steadily till 12pm on Monday. This steady high level of pollution is bit unusual at this time of the year. Generally, the atmosphere remains much cleaner at this time of the year. “It seems the fog has contributed to this. It trapped the emitted particles and prevented it from escaping into the atmosphere,” said an environmentalist.
 
 A significant change in   and pollution levels is being ruled out on Tuesday. “It will be foggy again, but we expect a clearer weather on Wednesday,” said Das. The minimum temperature could rise by a degree over the next 48 hours. “The maximum temperature could touch 32°C in the course of the next 48 hours but there won’t be a sharp rise in mercury,” Das added.
