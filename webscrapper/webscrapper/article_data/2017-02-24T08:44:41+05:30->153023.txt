HYDERABAD: In an obvious showdown between the   and the   (ERC), the   the Thursday (February 23) deadline imposed by the latter for the former to submit the   for the coming fiscal. The ERC had warned that if the discoms do not adhere to the deadline, then it would be forced to act suo motu on the matter.

 Sources said the discoms could not submit the tariff hike proposals as the same were not approved by the government. Apart from approving the proposals, the state should also indicate its preparedness to bear the subsidy amount, give its assent to bear the burden of   as well as give a guarantee on financing future PPAs.
 
 Although power minister G Jagadish Reddy returned from his China visit on Thursday and instructed the power officials to secure clearance for the proposals from the CM, KCR chose not to give them time on Thursday, thus forcing the discoms to not meet the deadline imposed by the ERC.
