BENGALURU:  ,   have soared in Bengaluru city, notably in 2016 which saw a loss of property amounting to over Rs 110 crore by victims of various offences. The detection rate in these crimes had seen a dip, as cracking such cases is often taxing for police investigators who suspect that a sizable number of new criminals and thieving gangs are possibly visiting the city.

 Bengaluru City Police (BCP) has intensified night patrolling and will bring in a fresh fleet of vehicles for police stations to reduce crime in the city.
 
 Last October, Ratna James, 60, a retired English teacher of Bishop Cotton Girls’ School, got the disturbing phone call that her house was burgled when she was holidaying with her husband in South Africa. “We rushed back home in panic and were stunned to see the bottom panel of the main door completely removed and gold jewellery, pearls and precious stones missing from inside the house,” she said, outside her home at Versova Layout in C V Raman Nagar.
 
 Ratna lodged a complaint with Byappanahalli police station, who are still probing the burglary along with two more cases reported in the layout last year, where burglars had decamped with gold jewellery, cash and even alcohol bottles, a police source said.
 
 In 2016, BCP recorded 1,269 cases of house break thefts committed at night in various parts of the city, in which Bengalureans lost gold, silver, cash and other valuables worth crores to burglars. But the detection rate was only 16%. “There is a huge influx of people to Bengaluru, which includes a sizable number of criminals. Some don’t have any identity or their antecedents aren’t recorded by their employers, and when they indulge in crimes like burglary, robbery or   it is hard to trace them, unlike local offenders of whom we have a database based on prior crime patterns with intelligence inputs,” said an assistant commissioner attached to South Zone, asserting that a rise in crime is due to criminal gangs from outside foraying into Bengaluru.
 
 While stringent measures by police saw chain snatching in the city dip by 26% last year, figures of dacoity escalated alarmingly to 106% and robbery to 49%, in comparison with 2015. Cases of muggings after dark and even during the day, turned common with at least one in 10 denizens knowing someone who was robbed of his or her cellphone, cash or bicycle on Bengaluru’s streets.
 
 Last September, advertising professional Kamalendar was attacked with a knife and robbed inside a moving autorickshaw on Spencer Road in Fraser Town, before being muscled out of the vehicle. “It happened around 9.30pm after I hailed an autorickshaw on Coles Road, and a young man climbed in shortly after, claiming he was the driver’s friend. The driver started taking a detour through Spencer Road and the man suddenly snatched my cellphone and tried to grab my wallet. When I put up a fight, he cut me with the knife,” recalled Kamalendar, 36, who was pushed out of the autorickshaw before the duo calculatedly snatched his slippers, apart from his cellphone, so he wouldn’t chase the vehicle for long. He refrained from lodging a police complaint as his loss of laptop and cash to a cabbie in July 2016 failed to yield an FIR from the Pulikeshi Nagar police, or his lost articles.
 
 City police commissioner Praveen Sood, who took charge in January, said he was determined to bring down the crime rate in Bengaluru by cracking down on the culprits. “We have mobilized a total of 221 Hoysalas on day and night patrol, with additional checks at isolated locations and crime-prone areas. We are in the process of setting up 579 CCTV cameras at key locations to monitor criminal activity, especially to ensure the safety of women,” Sood added.
 
 The top cop is also phasing out old vehicles from city police stations and introducing 272 new vehicles to the fleet, primarily to curb crime in the city.
