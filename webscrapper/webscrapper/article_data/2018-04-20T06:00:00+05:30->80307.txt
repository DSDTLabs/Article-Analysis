Ranchi: The   government will file a   regarding the Supreme Courtâ€™s directives on   (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which led to protests across the country. Chief minister   on Thursday instructed the home department to file the petition with the apex court. 

 The state government in a communique has stated that Jharkhand has a sizeable populace of SC and ST people and very few instances of false implication of people under the Act can be found here. Several other states, including the BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have already taken a decision to file a review petition.
 
 The SC in judgment on March 20 put a ban on automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the Act. The court said public servants could not be prosecuted under the Act without the approval of appointing authority and private citizens should be arrested only after an inquiry under the law. The SC added that preliminary inquiry in case booked under the ST/SC Act would be conducted by a police officer of the rank of deputy superintendent of police to ensure the allegations are not frivolous.
