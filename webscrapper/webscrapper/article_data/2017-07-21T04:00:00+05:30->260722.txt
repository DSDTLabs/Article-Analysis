Vadodara: Moving scenes were witnessed due to the strike of private ambulance operators who stay put outside the SSG Hospital (SSGH). A family had to carry the dead body of a relative in an auto-rickshaw to the railway station due to the strike.

 With no vehicles available for taking the dead body of a resident of Uttar Pradesh to the station, the family called for a rickshaw. But the railway authorities denied permission to carry the body without a coffin in the train. Sources said that eventually the family contacted a local acquaintance and the body was cremated in the city.
 
 The ambulance operators had stayed away from work seeking space to park their vehicles inside the campus. 
 
 Operators claimed that 30 to 40 of them survive on work they get from the SSGH but they have to remain outside the campus. Protesting against this, the operators struck work and held demonstrations at the SSGH. According to sources, the 108 ambulances donâ€™t carry dead bodies and are meant to handle only emergencies. The fire brigade does have these, but the numbers are few and these mostly stay busy.
