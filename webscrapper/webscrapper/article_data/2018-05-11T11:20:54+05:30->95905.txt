 According to highly-placed officials, the officer was transferred to Bangalore circle on Wednesday. She joined duty in Amaravati circle after being on long leave just before giving that controversial circular to TTD, asking them to furnish information so that ASI can explore the possibilities of declaring TTD temples as "monuments of national importance". The circular was issued on May 5 and her transfer was executed within four days.
 
 Sources told TOI that though the ASI has named another official to join in her place at Amaravati, the officer is not very keen on taking up the post. 
 
 Officials say though there is nothing technically wrong in giving out the circular which is a regular procedure, the circular became controversial after the TDP regime accused the Centre of trying to curb the TTD's independence. 
 
 TTD officials warned that they would approach court if any such attempt is made by the ASI. "The circular seems to be the main reason behind her sudden transfer," a source told TOI.
