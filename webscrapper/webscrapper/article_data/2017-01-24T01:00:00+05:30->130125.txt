Actress  , who is currently seen in the serial   may have left Lucknow more than two decades ago, but the actress says she still misses the city. “My paternal grandparents are from Malihabad. Since at that time, schools were not good enough there, my parents decided to shift to Lucknow. We moved into my Nani’s house in Vikas Nagar. I did schooling from St. Agnes’ Loreto Day School, then 11th and 12th from Loreto Convent and completed my graduation from Avadh Girls’ Degree College. While doing graduation, I got married, but only after completing my education I shifted to Mumbai,” says Shalini, who was earlier seen in shows like Pavitra Rishta, Bhagyalakshmi, Balika Vadhu and also gained popularity for playing the role of Lal Bahadur Shastri’s mother in the film Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan. 

 
 
 
 
 “From the last 21 years, I have been staying in Mumbai, but Lucknow still holds a special place in my heart. It’s the city where I spent my childhood, and have so many memories associated with it. Every Lucknowite settled in any other city misses Lucknow’s food the most and I am no exception. I miss Motimahal ki chaat, Prakash ki kulfi and Kabab’s of Dastarkhwan a lot (laughs).”
