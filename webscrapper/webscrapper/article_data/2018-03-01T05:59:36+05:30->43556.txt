PALAKKAD: Varode Sirajudeen,   municipal councillor and father of deceased   worker   (23), on Wednesday, changed his earlier stand that ruled out political angle in his son's murder. He had first told the media that his son was murdered due to personal rivalry with neighbours. 

 But, at a second press conference a few hours later, he said that Safeer's was a political murder and some CPI supporters were involved in it because Safeer was an obstacle to CPI's growth at  . Earlier, he said that the accused were members of IUML. Later, they joined CPM and are now supporters of the CPI.
 
 Safeer had some issues with the accused during his school days and later with the mosque committee. The mosque committee had intervened to settle the matter. There was also threat to the life of his son from one of the accused earlier. 
 
 This stand of the father had put IUML and   in an embarrassing position as they were alleging it was a political murder. So, it was alleged that UDF had put pressure on the father to state that it was a political murder.
 
  president MM Hassan said here on Wednesday that it was a political murder and blamed some CPI activists. But, CPI district secretary Suresh Raj said that his party has nothing to do with the murder. He demanded stern action against culprits and said his party will not extend any support to the accused. Mannarkkad police had also said that it was not a political murder but the result of personal rivalries between neighbours. This police stand and father's belief initially put IUML in an embarrassing position as it had organized a hartal in Mannarkkad against the murder on Monday. Police had arrested five neighbours in connection with the murder.
