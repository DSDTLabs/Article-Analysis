NEW DELHI: Following the scare caused over European skies last week when one of its planes went incommunicado for a few minutes and led to rushing of fighter planes,   sent a stern reminder to all its pilots on Tuesday over  . 

 "Radio communication is a critical link in the pilot - ATC (air traffic control) communication system. However, it can be broken with surprising speed and disastrous results," the mail says.
 
 The airline then went on to list vital do's as "mandatory compliance". "When instructed by ATC to change frequencies, select the new frequency as soon as possible unless instructed to make the change at a specific time, fix, or altitude. Maintain the previous frequency on the standby frequency window until positively in two-way contact with the new frequency. Undue delay in making the change could result in an untimely receipt of important information," it says.
 
 The confusion last Thursday was caused when the pilots had to switch over frequency during "change over" from the ATC of a region in one country to the ATC of another region in other country. 
 
 Being a continent of mostly small countries, pilots flying over Europe have to change frequencies very frequently as they enter airspace of different countries in quick succession.
 
 "It is the responsibility of the pilot in command (PIC) to ensure that at least one crew member shall continuously maintain air-ground voice communication watch on the appropriate communication channel, and establish two-way communications as necessary with appropriate ATC unit."
