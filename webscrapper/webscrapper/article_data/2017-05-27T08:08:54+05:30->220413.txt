CHANDIGARH:   headquarters on Friday came to a standstill as cops of 1980s   recounted his experiments to   while trying to come to terms with the demise of the phenomenon called Gill. The first was  .

 During those days, about 100 journalists travelled at night with the police to see and show to the world that police are out and dominating the nights. Such was his popularity among the 1980s and 1990s era cops that his exploits became a banter and were being penned as part of condolence messages on cards.
 
 Rajinder Kumar, a 1980-batch IPS officer of Assam cadre, mentioned, “It was in July, on a muggy afternoon, when he called for a meeting at Harike, a far flung place and time for the meeting was 2 am. It was 2 am. Everyone thought it was 2 pm. But no one had courage to ask him directly.
 
  There was am amiable South Indian gentleman and he approached Gill to correct the time for the meeting but faced a wall of silence. When the meeting started on time and he asked his staff whether all had come, he surprised everyone while asking them to go back to their locations. That was the beginning of the operation domination and tables were turned. Needless to say, that was the most peaceful night. KPS Sir, rest in peace.”
 
 It was Gill who first brought the concept of bullet-proof tractors in Punjab, a rare strategy by a police to counter hiding terrorists in the sugarcane fields. The popularity of these BP tractors to counter terrorists saw their order being placed for the first time in Punjab in 30 years before they made a return in 2016. 
 
 There were officers who recollected how a Willys jeep was modified to adjust to Gill's tall, wiry frame of six feet and three inches. “When someone asked him, how tall are you, he replied, it depends on situation,” said one senior cop.
