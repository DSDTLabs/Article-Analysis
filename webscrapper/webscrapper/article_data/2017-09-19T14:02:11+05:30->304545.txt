PATNA: Amid widespread concern over safety standards in highrise buildings in the city, the Patna district administration has decided to audit the safety measures in  , hotels and  .

 Sources said the administration has convened a meeting of the theatre, mall and hotel owners on Thursday, where Patna DM   would brief them about the need to comply with the safety norms.
 
 Agarwal told this reporter on Monday the meeting would focus on the administration’s stress on making public places safe. “We will ask for adequate exit routes and exit signage, alternative evacuation mechanism in case of a power failure, efficacy of fire safety equipment, house-keeping department, CCTV cameras and first-aid facility, among other things,” the   said.
 
 The move comes close on the heels of fire incidents in a furniture factory in Vaishali district and a mall on Boring Road in Patna in recent past. “It is high time the owners of public places like cinema halls, malls and hotels took the responsibility and were made accountable for the safety of people visiting their establishments,” the DM said.
 
 Agarwal said functional CCTV cameras are a must in hotels. “A guest went missing from a Patna hotel recently. When police checked the hotel’s CCTV cameras, they were not functioning,” the DM recalled and added such callousness on the part of management of the hotels won’t be allowed.
 
 He also said that the malls, cinema halls and hotels should have adequate security personnel, trained to handle situations like earthquakes etc.
 
 According to the DM, the administration would form a security audit team to inspect the cinema halls, malls and hotels. Those found lacking will face action, including cancellation of licence, he said.
