AHMEDABAD: The brand-new zebra crossings on all four sides of Dada Saheb na   is getting a lot of attention. Instead of the traditional colours of zebra - white and black - these markings combine red and white.

 While the   ( ) authorities consider it as an exercise to make the roads safer for pedestrians with higher visibility, road safety experts believe it to be an effort in different direction.
 
 Amit  , a city-based road safety expert, said that the standards for road signs and markings are standardized by   (IRC). “Red is always associated with danger whereas pedestrian zone, commonly known as zebra crossing, signifies a safe passage for the commuter. Nowhere in the Code of Practice for Road Markings published by IRC one can find the use of red to demarcate the pedestrian zone,” he said, adding that combination of white and red in fact indicates road repairs.
 
 Khatri compared the different usage as a different language which is not understood by majority of speakers. “It is important for road users to understand the language of road markings and signs. White and yellow are used in road markings due to its high contrast during night time to increase visibility. Colour red doesn’t serve that purpose,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Mukesh Kumar, municipal commissioner, AMC, said that the markings doesn’t violate any rule. “The markings, to increase safety of the pedestrians, are applied after consultation with experts. It is primarily on experimental basis and we are documenting the reviews,” he said.
 
 Road safety experts also pointed out at other practices such as applying white stripes on speed breakers - signifying them as pedestrian zones.
