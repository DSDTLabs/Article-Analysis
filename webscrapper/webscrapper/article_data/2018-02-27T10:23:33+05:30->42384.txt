HYDERABAD: The   party's   bus yatra got off to an impressive start on Monday with almost all seniors and veterans setting aside the differences within the party and attending the event. Thousands of people thronged the yatra launch venue at Chevella and many more queued up on roadsides and other vantage points along the bus yatra route. 

 Stating that the yatra is being taken up against the injustices being meted out by the KCR-led TRS government to tribals, Dalits, BCs, minorities and other sections of the society, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy vowed to render justice to every community if Congress government comes to power.
 
 Uttam also said that Congress will revert to the old design of the Kaleshwaram project and supply water up to Chevella as per the old design of Pranahitha-Chevella project. The party also vowed to revive the ITIR project that would provide lakhs of jobs, a project not being pursued by the TRS government.
 
 Uttam and other party leaders began the day by offering prayers at the Dargah-e-Yousufain in Nampally, conducting a special puja at   in Langar Houz and seeking blessings at the Moinabad Church before proceeding to Chevella.
 
 Addressing the public meeting at Chevella, Uttam said Telangana was achieved due to the struggle of all sections of the society. Sonia Gandhi granted statehood anticipating the welfare of SC, ST, BC and minorities. "Even after four years, there is no change in anyone's life except for four members of CM K  's family. Now, a fifth member of the family is likely to get a Rajya Sabha ticket soon," Uttam said.
