Jalandhar:  , who was convicted in Canada for making an attempt on the life of visiting Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) minster of Punjab, Malkiat Singh Sidhu in 1986, has now been invited to be hosted by the Canadian high commissioner in India for visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Atwal belongs to Pharala village in district Nawanshahr. The Canadian high commission rescinded the invitation following a controversy. 

 Atwal was convicted with three others for attacking Sidhu, then minister of state for planning and cooperative departments in the Surjit Singh Barnala government. The attack took place on Vancouver Island in May, 1986.
 
 Atwal hails from Doaba region, the NRI hub of Punjab and most of the population of Pharala village comprises NRIs. Inquiries from his village revealed that no member of his immediate family lives in Pharala village, which he visited over a year back.
 
 A relative of his, who did not want to be named, told TOI that Atwal could not visit India for several years and got the Indian visa recently. He also confirmed that Atwal visited more than a year ago. 
 
 It is learnt that Atwalâ€™s father, Gurdev Singh migrated to Madhya Pradesh and cultivated land there. Jaspal went to Canada and rarely visited his native village. He joined the International Sikh Youth Federation, which was later banned.
 
 He and three others, Jasbir Singh Atwal, Sukhdial Singh Gill and Amarjit Sngh Dhindsa were sentenced to 20 years in jail each and a ban on having firearms or explosives for another 25 years. Atwal has been running the Vancouver-based Media Waves radio network. 
 
 This is not the first time his presence at an official function has caused a controversy. An invitation to him from British Columbia premier Christy Clark for the budget speech in February 2012 also created huge controversy. The Conservative Party issued a hard-hitting statement to corner Clark, whose office said they had not vetted names on the list.
