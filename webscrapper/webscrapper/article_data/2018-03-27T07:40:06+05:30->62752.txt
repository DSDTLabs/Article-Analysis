AHMEDABAD: A major fire engulfed over 100 shanties around   late on Sunday night. Firefighting started at 11.30pm on Sunday and continued till 7.30am on Monday. The   (AFES) used about 3 lakh litres of water to control flames. Over 1,000 persons were rendered homeless after the fire. Senior city administrators, including mayor Gautam Shah, visited the spot on Sunday and Monday. 

 While no person was reported dead in the fire, three persons sustained minor burns injuries and were given first aid by a team of paramedics. Some local residents said they have lost livestock. According to AFES officials, a call was received from residences near   at about 11.15pm. While the reason for the fire has not been ascertained, it is suspected that a short-circuit or an LPG cylinder blast started the blaze. An AFES team reached the spot with 18 vehicles including firefighters and tankers.
 
 Mithun Mistry, divisional fire officer, AFES, said that water lines were extended to over 110 feet as only two of the vehicles could venture inside close-knit shanties. "Accessibility issues lengthened the duration of operations. We asked local residents to leave their belongings and move to elevated places," he said. "Even after 7.30am, we had two vehicles at the spot to address any emergency."
 
 Residents refused to leave the spot despite several appeals. A resident told TOI that there were issues of 'territory.' The residents felt that if they left the spot, someone else would claim it. So they sat on mounds of ash with their belongings.
