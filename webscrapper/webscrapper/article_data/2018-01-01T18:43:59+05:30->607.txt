 The guests will have a whale of time as they are seen enjoying every moment on the show with so much fun and banter. Judging by the promos aired by the channel on its social networking page, the episode will feature the guests who will share updates about the film which has   in lead. 
 
 Later, actor Vishnu can be seen engaging in some banter as he says 99 percent of the people love to act in films and the rest one present lies that they dent like to act in films and Aji shares his anxiety and experience about his debut acting. To add the humour quotient on the show, a brigade of comedy artists join with fun-filled stints. 
 Actor Vishnu scores well on the show with his witty counters and also by cracking jokes on Aji and Alphonsa. Apart from conversation the actors later participate in dumb charades, taking some of the famous film titles from Malayalam cinema. 
 When it is the turn of Aji, he is made to do the dumb charades on the popular film in 90’s Golanthara Vartha. Vishnu turns the round into a rib tickling one by guessing out weird words from the actions shown by Aji. 
 The young actress Alphonsa utilises the show to flaunt her singing skills as she enchants the audience with a Christian devotional song. 
 Known for his mimicry skills, Vishnu imitates some of the popular actor’s voice also. 
 
 The show hosted by actor   and Aswathy will be aired on the channel on January 1, at 8.30 pm.
