GUWAHATI: Unfazed by Beijing’s repeated warnings to India to cancel the Dalai Lama’s upcoming visit to Arunachal Pradesh, the Tibetan spiritual leader brushed aside these talks and kicked off his 13-day trip to northeast here on Saturday.

 "All these things are normal," the Tibetan spiritual leader remarked with his trademark smile when told that Beijing is not happy with India for allowing this trip. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman on Friday warned for the second time in one month that Dalai Lama’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh will “have serious damage on bilateral relations.”
