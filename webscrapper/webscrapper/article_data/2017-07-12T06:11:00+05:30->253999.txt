NOIDA: Farmers have demanded that the land for the Jewar international airport project be acquired under the new acquisition norms, where the compensation is supposed to be four times the ongoing circle rate of the land.

 “We demand that the airport being a Union government matter, the land be acquired from the farmers directly by the   and not via YEIDA,”  , convenor,   (KSS), told TOI.
 
 “We also hope the Union government makes us a part of the development programme. Our youths should be gainfully employed in the project and it should generate enough jobs and opportunities for all those who are going to be displaced for this project,” he added.
