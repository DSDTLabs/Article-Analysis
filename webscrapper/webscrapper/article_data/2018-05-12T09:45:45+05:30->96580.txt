The average citizensâ€™ interest in elections is growing. In the run-up to Karnataka polls, citizens groups have sprung up to present their own manifestos and encourage fellow citizens to vote.

 Elsewhere in rural Karnataka, campaigning incumbent legislators have faced sharp posers by ordinary voters about their deeds and misdeeds. In some villages, legislators, who showed up for the first time after being elected in 2013 only to seek votes again, were told to retreat. None other than chief minister Siddaramaiah had to learn this in Chamundeshwari as he allegedly kept no contact with this constituency after his last election from there in 2006.
 
 The culture of passivity during elections seems to be slowly giving rise to a new electoral culture of questioning and demanding. But the underlying trends need a more nuanced understanding.
 
 In Indian democracy, the most empowering moment for ordinary citizens is when they queue up in a polling booth to cast their vote. And their most disempowering moment is when they happen to visit any government office or agency even for the simplest of services. The gap between these two situations has been growing, bringing elected representatives to centre stage.
 
 Legislators are no longer legislators. During non-election time, they are mediators between disempowered citizenry and an absurdly stiff and insensitive state machinery. They shape the local state by choosing officials of their choice, capture the local governments whose elected representatives are seen as their subordinates and function like the state unto themselves in cocking a snook at theories of democracy.
 
 People have now got adjusted to a legislator-centric governance especially in rural areas. In an issueless elections as this one, therefore, people have begun to take direct interest in candidates by encountering them with their frustrations and engaging them with their expectations.
