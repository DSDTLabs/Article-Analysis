HYDERABAD: The issue of the dysfunctional   (MRI) machine at   (OGH) came to the fore on Saturday after a city-based NGO rued how it was seriously inconveniencing patients. 

 Helping Hand, the NGO, wrote, “The MRI machine at Osmania General Hospital is not functioning for the past one month and also the viral screening kits for HIV/HCV/Hepatitis B are not in stock from the last few months hence resulting in undue hardship to the   at OGH.” (sic) 
 
 Alleging that a patient, diagnosed with Hemiplagia — paralysis of one side of the body — succumbed to his ailment at the facility on Saturday, the NGO claimed that the 50-year-old died while being prepared to be taken to a private diagnostic lab for an MRI scan. 
 
 “But by then, his condition further worsened as he complained of shivering and vomiting and was moved to AMCU ( ),” a release issued by the organisation said. 
 
 While   refused to confirm this particular case, they admitted that the MRI machine has been gathering dust for the past few weeks. “The vendor who supplied the machine to us has doubled the price. We have constituted a committee to bargain with the vendor and the issue is expected to be resolved by Monday. Until the deal is finalised, we cannot utilise the machine,” said Dr GVK Murthy, superintendent of OGH.
