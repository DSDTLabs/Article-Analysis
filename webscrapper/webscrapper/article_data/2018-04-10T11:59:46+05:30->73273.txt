A Roman-style chariot, gold Rolex watch, leather jock strap and a 128-year-old violin that all belonged to Australian actor   have been sold in an auction that reaped in more than $2.8 million dollars.
 
 The auction titled ‘The Art of Divorce’ was held in Sydney on Saturday and attracted dozens of buyers and spectators. About 200 movie costumes, props from some of his most popular films, including 'Gladiator', 'Master and Commander', 'LA Confidential' and 'The Insider', went under the hammer.
 
 The auction was held on what would have been his 15th wedding anniversary with former wife   and Crowe’s 54th birthday. Auction house reported many items sold for well above their estimated value, including a pair of metal cuffs the Oscar winner wore in 'Gladiator', which was valued at up to $1,535 but sold for $29,974. The replica chariot used in the 2000 film 'Gladiator' sold for $49,907.
 
 There were also some unusual items, including a fossil of a dinosaur-era reptile’s skull, which was previously owned by U.S. actor   which sold for $60,886. Crowe made an unexpected appearance during the auction, cheerfully welcoming would-be buyers.
