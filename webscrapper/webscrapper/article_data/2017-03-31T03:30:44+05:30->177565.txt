New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday refused to stay trial court proceedings in a criminal   complaint filed against chief minister   and his deputy  .

 However, Justice I S Mehta exempted them from personal appearance on April 6 when the case is listed before the trial court. The two AAP leaders, who had sought quashing of the complaint filed by advocate Surender Kumar Sharma, have also been asked to file an exemption application through their counsel before the trial court.
 
 Both have also sought a stay on the proceedings before the trial court, which is yet to start. They have argued that the order summoning them is “erroneous” as a patently false complaint has been filed against them.
 
 During Thursday’s hearing, HC also asked Sharma to file his response to a notice by July 28 and sought a status report from Delhi Police. Sharma has also named Yogendra Yadav, now part of Swaraj India. 
 
 Sharma has alleged that AAP volunteers asked him to contest the assembly elections in 2013, saying   was pleased with his social service. He filled up the application form after being told by Sisodia and Yadav that AAP’s political affairs committee had decided to give him a ticket. However, he didn’t get the ticket and the leaders had soon issued “defamatory, unlawful and derogatory words” against him, lowering his reputation in the Bar and the society, the complaint said.
 
 Both Kejriwal and Sisodia claimed that cancellation or allotment of an election ticket was the prerogative of the party. They said that while Sharma initially claimed that there was no case pending against him, it “was found that several cases were pending against him”. Their counsel said the party, not Kejriwal, issued the press release against Sharma. “So no defamation case is made out against the CM.” 
 
 The trial court had granted bail to Kejriwal, Sisodia and Yadav after they appeared before it.
