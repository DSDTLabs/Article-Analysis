PUNE: The   here are now targeting April 30 for the switch-over to   from conventional energy.

 Airpor officials on Monday saud the 300 Kwp (kilowattpeak) solar project was still being installed and that the “scheduled date” of completion was April 30. In February, the authorities had said the Rs 1.27 crore-project would be over by March 31.
 
 An official at the airport claimed that there was no delay in the work. “We want to ensure that the project is effective and without any glitches. Some more time has been sought for that,” the official said.
 
 “We will update all once the work is complete,” Pune airport director Ajar Kumar told TOI in a text message. 
 
 The solar power plant is being set up at the airport’s hangar. “Once the project is completed and operational, many facilities at the airport will run on solar power,” another official said.
 
 Around 2,600 LEDs were installed at the airport last week, leading to reduced electricity consumption. The plan is to lit up the entire facility with solar power, which will also be its source of operation. However, conventional power supply will be kept as an alternative and used in cases of snags. 
 
 Earlier, MP and   chairman Anil Shirole had said that the airport authorities were trying to tap solar energy following a detailed discussion with minister of state for civil aviation Jayant Sinha. 
 
 During his visit to Pune in June last year, Sinha had held discussions with the airport authorities on the use of solar power. He had then said the aim was to ensure that all airports in the country, including Pune, would run on solar power on the lines of the facility in Kochi.
