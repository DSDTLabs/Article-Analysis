NEW DELHI: Freddy Mirza has been facing taunts and abuses for years — the reason is the 19-year-old from Faridabad belongs to the LGBTQ community. However, on Friday, Freddy, and thousand others like him, saw a glimmer of hope when   started working in Delhi to make them “feel safe and happy”.

 Besides providing crisis management and counselling services,   Trust, one of India’s oldest male health and LGBTQ organisations, will also try to influence policy formulations and reformation of laws concerning the community.
 
 Ashok Row Kavi, one of the first people in the country to ‘come out’, started it in Mumbai in 1994. He believes that the Delhi centre will be a “hub of services committed to mental and physical health where psychiatrists and other professionals will provide integrated sessions”. 
 
 However, the organisation faces several challenges.   (21) said his parents “want me to go to a gym for a good body. They want me to get a daughter-in-law for them. We are also perceived as sex maniacs”. Now, the trust hopes to educate people about the realities. It will also run a drop-in centre where like-minded people can come together, said  , programme manager of the Delhi office.
 
 Nitish Anand, or Tish as he likes to be called, said the centre would boost confidence of those reeling under societal pressure. He said his father accepted his reality when he came out two years ago but many face hostility. “It is far more easier when our family accepts us,” said the 18-year-old.
