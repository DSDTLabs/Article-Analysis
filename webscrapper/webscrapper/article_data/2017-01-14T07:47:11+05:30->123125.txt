HYDERABAD: While   races towards completion of two stretches in the first leg, delays on road repairs and removal of debris continue to give commuters a tough time every day.

 Be it Sultan Bazaar to   stretch in   or  , tonnes of debris are yet to be cleared.The scenario is same on   stretch, where road widening is still underway.
 
 Another bottleneck area is Ameerpet road near  , where debris is lying on the roadside, extending travel time for motorists.
 
 Currently only Sultan Bazaar to Badichowdi stretch is undergoing road widening work, but the work is half completed due to pending acquisition. The delay in acquisitions has not only kept traders from shifting to the rehabilitation complex but has also delayed road repair work further. “This stretch of road at Badi Chowdi has been damaged for more than eight months now and authorities have told us they won't lay roads before the entire work is completed. When all shopke epers have voluntarily given their consent for dismantling, then why are authorities so slow ? We are forced to put up with the shabby condition of roads here,“ said Bismillah Khan, a trader.
