PATNA: The state police headquarters has kept anti-riot force on standby in all the districts for Durga Puja and Muharram, DGP P K Thakur told TOI after a high-level review meeting presided over by chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh here on Tuesday. He said 500 additional home guard jawans would also be deployed in Araria, Banka, Sheikhpura and Kaimur districts to keep a close watch on antisocial elements.

 The police headquarters has already deployed more than 9,000 constables and 2,500 home guards across the state as security arrangements made for Durga Puja and Muharram.
 
 The DGP said the main thrust of the meeting was to ensure peace and no clash of timing for the Durga idol immersion and Muharram procession anywhere in the state.
 
 “Deployment of force was discussed with emphasis on areas where violence had taken place in the past,” the DGP said.
 
 ADG (HQ) A K Singhal said, “Total 25 DSPs from the police headquarters have been deployed in seven districts, including 17 in Patna.” The Puja organizers would be requested to install CCTV cameras inside and around the pandals, he added.
 
 The ADG also said police officers had been ordered to visit the places under their respective jurisdictions and verify the field deployment of policemen. “Anti-riot force and fire tenders in each district have been kept ready. Information of every small development will have to be communicated to the home department and state police headquarters,” he said. 
 
 All senior officials of police and civil administration were present at the meeting. The DGP and CS also addressed the DMs, SSPs and SPs through videoconferencing.
 
 Tuesday’s meeting was the third high-level meeting within 10 days to review the security arrangements for the festivals.
