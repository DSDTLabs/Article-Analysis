Supermodel   and her singer boyfriend   like wearing each other's clothes. 

 In an interview, the 22-year-old model asked Zayn, "I shop in your closet all the time, don't I?" 
 
  
  
 To which he replied, "Yeah, but same." 
 
 The ' ' hitmaker, who has been dating the model for almost two years, recalled borrowing a designer T shirt. 
 
 Gigi said, "It's not about gender. It's about, like, shapes. And what feels good on you that day. And anyway, it's fun to experiment ..." 
 
 Zayn added that it is important to be confident with your own image. 
 
 "With social media, the world's gotten very small and it can seem like everyone's doing the same thing. Gender, whatever - you want to make your own statement. You know? You want to feel distinct," he said.
