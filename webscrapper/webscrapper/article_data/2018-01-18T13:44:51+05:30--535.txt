THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has decided to lift the treasury ban on local bodies, finance minister   said on Wednesday. However, they won't be given permission to transfer the funds from treasuries to other financial institutions. All departments will have permission to clear bills amounting up to Rs 5 crore each.

 With the Centre lifting the restrictions on the state government for taking loans, the financial position of the state is expected to improve. The government can mobilize Rs 2,000 crore loan from various means for the time being. 
 
 This was the reason why the government has decided to lift the restrictions imposed on the treasuries. 
 
 Isaac said that the government has released Rs 60 crore for the   to clear the pension arrears. The move is in line with the government's decision that only through a revival package that the crisis faced by the public transporter can be overcome. The KSRTC has defaulted on pension payment for the last five months. 
 
 "At present, the state government is bearing the cost of everything, including diesel. Things cannot go on like this for long. After the   government came to power Rs 1,565 crore has been given to KSRTC," said the finance minister.
 
 The minister blamed the Centre for not reducing fuel price despite the price of crude oil coming down in the international market. The Centre has been giving a free hand to the oil companies for increasing the prices and has been asking the state government to reduce tax. Let the Centre first do so, then the state government will react, said Isaac. 
 
 He admitted that there exists a wide gap between revenue and expenditure of the government. He said the government would introduce proposals in the budget to bring down the revenue deficit.
