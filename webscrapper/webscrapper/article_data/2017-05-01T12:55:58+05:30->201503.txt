BHOPAL: Controversial Ken-Betwa link project will be delayed further and take more time to commence, as some Supreme Court’s concerns are yet to be addressed. Water resources minister Uma Bharti said the issue is being looked into by a committee of the apex court.

 Schedule to be launched in December 2015, the project’s MoU was signed by MP, UP and ministry of water resources in 2005. In fact, the centre also wanted to have foundation stone ceremony of the project before UP elections, but the required permission could not be obtained. The Rs 18,000-crore project is all set to submerge about 100 square kilometres of the   ‘directly’, including around 50 square kilometres or about 10% of the critical tiger habitat. Out of a tiger reserve, the critical tiger habitat is considered central to the survival of the wild cat species in the region, said wildlife experts.
 
 Uma Bharti, who had last year threatened to proceed on strike, if the project was not cleared, said on Sunday that “all the clearances have been obtained and now the matter is pending with the Supreme Court”. During her Narmada Seva Yatra in Dindori, she said, “The project will take off as soon as the Supreme Court committee clears it.”
 
 The project will transfer surplus water from the Ken river to the Betwa basin through a 221-km canal. It will provide irrigation to an area of 6,35,661 hectares in Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh and Panna districts of MP and Mahoba, Banda and Jhansi districts of UP. In the construction of the first phase, a dam, 2-power houses, 2 tunnels and link canal are proposed. She said the project will be completed within 7 years.
