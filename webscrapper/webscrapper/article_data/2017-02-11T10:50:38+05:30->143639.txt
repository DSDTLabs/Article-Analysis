BHOPAL: The arrest of 11 suspects in an alleged ISI spy ring in Madhya Pradesh has triggered a Twitter war between Congress and BJP. 

 While senior BJP leader   on Friday praised the state police for busting the racket, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh sparked controversy by stating "none of the ISI suspects was a Muslim". "I congratulate chief minister   and Madhya Pradesh Police for this special achievement. Terrorism and its perpetrators in any form, must be crushed," tweeted Vijayavargiya.
 
 Digvijaya took a dig at Prime Minister Modi and his supporters by tweeting, "ISI agents arrested in Bhopal do not have a single Muslim. One of the suspects is a BJP member. Modi's supporters must think of it."
 
 Congress leaders then released some pictures, alleging that one of the suspects, named Dhruv Saxena, was district convener of the IT cell of   (BJYM). Some pictures showed Saxena at BJP programmes accompanying top BJP leaders, including the CM, Vijayavargiya and Bhopal BJYM president Anshul Tiwari.
 
 BJP countered that anybody can take a selfie with top leaders and can join party membership drive. State BJP chief   said, "I don't know Dhruv and neither is he a member of the party. I congratulate ATS for the arrests. Digvijaya Singh's tweet is aimed to vitiate communal harmony in the state."
 
 "A picture cannot corroborate connivance of any leader with a criminal or anti-social element. People take photos with top leaders and sometimes join public and party functions to take advantage. But this does not indicate any association," said Anshul Tiwari.
 
 Home minister Bhupendra Singh eulogised Shivraj Singh Chouhan for "his efficient leadership leading to breaking the network of ISI in the world".
 
 "The most powerful action against terrorism in India is being taken in Madhya Pradesh. First, police killed   after a jailbreak and now the law enforcing agency unearthed the ISI network," he told reporters in Sagar.
