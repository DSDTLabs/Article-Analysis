PORVORIM: Technocrat and former director of  , who is part of the  , on Thursday said that for Goa’s startup ecosystem to really kick off, information technology has to stop becoming a buzz word and must instead become the backbone for governance and service delivery.

 Speaking to reporters at the secretariat ahead of a meeting of the council, Pai said that for Goa to become one of Asia’s top 25 startup destinations, there were four critical elements that had to fall in place.
 
 “To become the hotspot in India, Goa must be a fully digital state. Every house should have an internet connection and every person, a smart device,” Pai said in the presence of minister for information and technology  .
 
 The second most important factor that drives innovation and growth of startups is research and development facilities, Pai said. “Set up high quality research labs in artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, 3D printing and other futuristic technologies. Also encourage chip design companies to come and set up here,” he said.
 
 He said that the absence of an ecosystem was prompting Goans to venture to other states and countries where they could apply their skills. “We want to create a situation in Goa where our brightest young engineers can become entrepreneurs. They will have access to funding,” Pai said.
 
 Pai, who helped draft and finalise the Goa Startup Policy and Goa IT Investment Policy also outlined the role the state government would have to play in creating a conducive ecosystem in Goa. “Get the startups to come here,” Pai said.
 
 He added that it was for the state government to lead the way by using IT-enabled services to engage with citizens. “Every service that the government provides should be through digital services,” he said.
