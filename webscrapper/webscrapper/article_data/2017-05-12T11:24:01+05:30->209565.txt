 Paldi resident Rakesh Shah and his friends booked a Goa tour for Rs 7,777 per person about a month ago. The package included a three-day, four- night package at five-star hotels and flight charges. Rakesh was to leave for Goa at 11 am on Thursday. When he did not receive the flight tickets even by morning, he went to the office and found 75 others in the same situation.

However, when police heard the entire tale, they hauled Parth to the police station for duping his clients.
 
 Soon, more of his victims arrived at the station and demanded that he return their money. Satyendra Shah, a resident of Naranpura, said, "My daughter and 15 others went on a trip to Goa through the travel firm. However, when the group reached there, they realised that Parth had not booked them into the hotel that was promised. It was some cheap place that did not cost as much. Also, Parth did not send them tickets to fly back from Goa.

Meanwhile, Parth Shah defended himself, claiming he had to cancel tours as rates of air tickets and hotels rose significantly. Navrangpura Inspector R V Desai said, "We have started an investigation into the fraud complaint registered against Parth. We have heard all the victims and are examining their documents."
