BIJNOR: Until a few years ago, the   of river Ganga in Bijnor had large expanses of reed, a tall grass-like plant, used for making furniture by the villagers of Dayalwada and  . However, over time the supply of reed dwindled and finished products made with it went out of fashion. Now, the central government has come forward to revive the craft at these villages by integrating them with its Kaushal Vikas Yojana and Mudra Yojana.
 
 A decade ago, almost 80% of residents of Dayalwada and Chauharwala areas were engaged in making reed furniture as it grew abundantly in the area till they were replaced by cane and other crops. Dayalwala village, which was completely dependent upon furniture craft, had an annual turnover close to Rs 1 crore. It has now reduced to Rs 25 lakh only. With the central government stepping in, they hope their fortune will turn.
  
 Giving details, Bijnor MP Bhartendra Singh said, “We have selected five villages, including Dayalwala, Chaharwala and Biruwala, with a total population of around 5,000. For a long time, artisans here have been lagging in the market as their methods of making reed furniture have become outdated. As a result, villagers have failed to increase their livelihood.”
  
 The MP said under Kaushal Vikas Yojana and Mudra Yojana, these artisans would be taught modern techniques of making furniture. “We have contacted Kamala agency, Delhi Hot and Fab India in this regard. They told us that they can purchase reed furniture if these products are made according to their design and specification. If everything goes well, each artisan can earn around Rs 200 a day.”
  
 Besides each artisan would have his own PAN card and bank account so that money could be transferred directly to them by the agencies. All villagers would be connected with  .
