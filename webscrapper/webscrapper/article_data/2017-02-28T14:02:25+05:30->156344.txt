Having made her   debut with ‘xXx: Return Of Xander Cage’ earlier this year, Deepika   has become a regular at the award parties in the West. The actress even attended the Oscars after-party where she looked like a glam goddess in a metallic   number. But did you know what she was up to before the most-awaited party of the year? 

 While most Hollywood stars were attending the awards ceremony, our darling   was up for some fun. Elizabeth Saltzman, Deepika’s stylist for her international commitments, gave us a glimpse of how the actress was goofing around during the fitting session, just hours before the Oscars after-party. “Before last night, before makeup and hair, in a fitting, that moment when a woman feels so good in a dream dress that you know it's hers,” she wrote as she shared the picture. Isn’t it absolutely endearing to see the actress chilling with complete abandon?
