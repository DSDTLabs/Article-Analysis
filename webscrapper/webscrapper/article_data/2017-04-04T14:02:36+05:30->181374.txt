PATNA/SASARAM: JD(U) on Monday suspended former   Surya Deo Singh from the party primary membership for allegedly killing 13-year-old girl Hazara Khatoon and injuring three other children besides his nephew Guddu Kumar (32) near his house at Tenduni Chowk in   under the same police station area in Rohtas on Sunday evening.
