GHAZIABAD: A fire broke out in a 3-storey building in Khoda’s   on Wednesday afternoon. Seven fire tenders managed to bring the blaze under control after nearly two hours. No causality has been reported so far.

 
 “At 4pm, we noticed black smoke rising out of a building that was used to store plastic and paper,” said  , a resident. “By the time we rushed to the spot, the three-storey building was up in flames. Since houses in the area are located close to each other, residents in the neighborhood were evacuated as a precautionary measure.”
 
 The building was used as a godown to store plastic and other inflammable material due to which fire spread quickly.
 
 Sunil Kumar, chief fire officer, said, “Initially we had rushed four fire tenders but sent three more to douse the fire. No casualties were reported as all residents in the neighbourhood were evacuated. Prima facie it looks like the fire may have started due to short circuit.”
 
 Since the bylanes of Khoda colony are narrow and encroached upon, it took longer for fire tenders to reach the spot. The godown was illegal and it belonged to one Vivek Prakash, who is a resident of Delhi, said sources.
