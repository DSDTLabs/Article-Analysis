Pune: The civic administration is faced with increasing expenses on its staff when the expenditure has gone up and income has fallen. 

 The civic body’s expenditure on the salaries for its staff has shot up by Rs 420 crore in the current year. In December 2016, the civic administration spent Rs 743 crore on staff salaries. In December 2017, this increased to Rs 1,163 crore. 
 
 The newly included staff of the education board to the PMC has added to the strength of employees. The school board was dissolved in June 2017 as its term ended. The civic body set up an education department to look after the functioning of the primary and secondary education divisions.
 
 The order, issued by the civic administration, then said there were 287 primary schools and 30 secondary schools run by the PMC, which were to function under the PMC’s education department.
 
 The new department is headed by additional municipal commissioner (general). The education officer is the branch head for secondary division, while the administrative officer (education) looks after the primary division. The staff working under the school board was shifted to other departments as per their ranks.
 
 The order said the civic body’s central stores depot will be responsible for purchase of stationery and other material for the department. The bank accounts of school board will be closed and the PMC’s finance and audit department will control the financial transactions of the education department.
 
 “There was a separate budget for the education board before it was dissolved. Now, its financial responsibilities have been added to the civic expenses. It has led to an increase in the civic body’s expense on staff,” Ulka Kalaskar, head of PMC’s accounts department, said.
