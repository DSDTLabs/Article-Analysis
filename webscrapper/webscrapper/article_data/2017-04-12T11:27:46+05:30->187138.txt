NEW DELHI: At least one-fourth of urban households in India don’t have a separate kitchen, according to recently released data based on the   ( ) carried out by the housing ministry.

 The survey indicates how nearly 1.7 crore urban households may be using their single room for cooking food as well.
 
 This fresh data gains importance considering that different studies have shown how air pollution in kitchens has become a major health concern and that too in urban areas where the ambient air is getting increasingly polluted due to vehicular emission and dust.
 
 A recent study published in Elsevier, a journal on environmental research, which assessed people’s personal exposure to pollution in Delhi, showed how kitchens can be more polluted than roads.
 
 The study mentioned how urban households, particularly kitchens, could be enveloping people in PM 2.5 pollutants as well.
 
 Other studies across the globe have also shown how kitchen appliances release colourless pollutants. Kitchens also get more polluted when they lack proper ventilation.
 
 In fact, the   (PMUY), launched by PM Narendra Mod, was a big step towards making kitchens smoke-free for women who are often the worst-affected by such pollution.
 
 According to SECC data, while Mizoram has the maximum percentage of such households, Bihar ranks second. In Daman and Diu and Kerala, over 90% households have exclusive kitchens.
 
 SECC data shows that in 2011, when the survey was conducted through a comprehensive door-to-door enumeration across the country, nearly 24.5% of urban households had a single room.
 
 Sources in the housing ministry said the SECC data collected in 2011 is being utilised in sanctioning houses for the urban poor with central aid under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. 
 
 SECC data, which conceals sensitive caste and poverty details in urban areas, gives details of how many families are “houseless” and how many live in rented accommodations in towns and cities.
