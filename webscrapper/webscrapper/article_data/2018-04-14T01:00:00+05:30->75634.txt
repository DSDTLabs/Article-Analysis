Trolling has become a global phenomenon and to curb cybercrime, MTV, one of India’s most popular youth channels, took an initiative to raise their voice against this alarming issue. They meticulously curated the reality show 'Troll Police' that deals with unmasking trolls. In a span of 13 weeks, the show has not only educated youngsters, but also created awareness about the fact that trolling is an offence, a crime and can land one behind bars.

 The premier edition of the show had prominent personalities like  , Mandira Bedi, Zareen Khan, Jwala Gutta and   not only confronting their trolls, but raising their voice against people who have abused their privileges in the name of ‘Freedom of Speech’.
 
 The finale episode will see ace director   confront his troll for the various disturbing allegations he has been subjected to, right from being labelled ‘ladkibaaz’ because of his relationships, to having strong views on politics and his movies, which he is passionate about. Talking about facing his biggest troll, Anurag said, “Most trolls are people who push you to your limits to see your dark side; they can be admirers and fans and sometimes, neither. Some trolls just don’t want you to have an opinion, they want to scare you to silence. I am curious to meet my troll on 'Troll Police' and see what sense I am able to instil in him.” The show has not only created awareness about cybercrime, but it has managed to help common people to stand up against wrongdoings and report their trolls through #TrollPoliceHelpline on Twitter.
 
 Tune in to see Anurag Kashyap confront his troll on   tonight at 7 pm on MTV.
