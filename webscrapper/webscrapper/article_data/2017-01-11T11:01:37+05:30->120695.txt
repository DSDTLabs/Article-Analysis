PATNA: All is   with the integrated   which has been declared a ‘premium call’. People who call this number are charged Rs 2 per minute, but it often feeds wrong information and gives evasive replies. Since the process is lengthy, one usually ends up paying anywhere between Rs 6 and Rs 10 per call. Each SMS, on the other hand, costs Rs 3.

 The railways has cancelled several pairs of premier trains due to foggy weather conditions in the last two months. However, there are several instances when the information provided on 139 caused problems to the commuters. The general refrain is that 139 is not reliable. 
 
 “139 provides vague information about movement of special trains. Even the inquiry counters at the stations are not aware of the arrival or departure of trains. The railways should update information about trains every minute so that passengers get correct information,” said city resident Prem Krishan on Tuesday.
 
 According to an East Central Railway official, railway inquiry number 139 has been outsourced to a Kolkata-based firm. 
 
 Special train: The railways started running a special train between Dibrugarh and   from Tuesday. While the train (05933) left Dibrugarh on January 10 and 11 at 9.35am, it will leave the Patna Junction on January 11 and 12 at 6.30pm to clear the rush of passengers. It has a load combination of 10 coaches, including one 2-AC, two 3-AC, 10 sleeper, four general coaches and two brake vans.
