  Raman tells Ishita that they should find a new accommodation for Roshni as her stay in Bhalla house can be a problem.
  
  Roshni finds Gagan outside the banquet hall. She tells him that she is really happy after marriage. When Gagan asks what is happening inside, Roshni tells him that Adi's family wants them to marry again. Gagan tells her that he knows the truth and she shouldn't lie.
  
  
 
  
  He scolds Roshni for helping Adi and his family. Roshni threatens him back for not spoiling Adi and his family's happiness else she will go to the police and disclose all his illegal business secrets and criminal offences.
  
  Gagan is shocked to see Roshni's changed personality. He says the city has spoiled her. Ishita comes in and sees them together. She then asks Gagan to come inside but he lies that he has some work and leaves. Roshni is relieved. Later, Ishita tells Roshni that she has asked Adi to send Roshni's marriage pictures so that they can find her husband. Roshni gets scared.
