When the film   was announced, it gained attention because it was being produced by Kaala director Pa Ranjith. The film, which is now finished, stars   and   in the lead roles, and is directed by Mari Selvaraj. “I was writing for a Tamil magazine and Ranjith seems to have followed my short stories. When he had come to know that I was planning to make a film, he called me and asked me to narrate my script. He liked it very much and said that he will produce it himself,” begins the debutant director on the origins of his film. Quiz him if the film will follow the Ranjith brand of cinema, and he says, “This film reflects the life of people in the   region. All I can say that though its treatment is mainstream, it will not be against the ideology and politics of Ranjith.”

 “Pariyerum Perumal is a local deity who is worshipped in southern Tamil Nadu. The hero of my film has this name. Kathir plays this role — of a youngster who enters law college with a lot of hope and wakes up to the realities. Anandhi plays his love interest, Jothi Mahalakshmi, and the main track of the film revolves around her character,” informs Mari Selvaraj. 
 
 He has also has the ubiquitous Yogi Babu, but the director says that rather than playing the comedian, the actor will be seen in a character role. “After Aandavan Kattalai,   will be seen playing a character that appears throughout the film,” he adds.
 
 The film’s technical team includes cinematographer Sridhar (who shot Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam) and composer Santhosh Narayanan. The latter, the director says, took up the project because the film had a backdrop that he hasn’t composed for. “He has given the film a sound that is a mix of folk (that is very much southern TN) and modern. We are launching the first single, Karuppi En Karuppi, today,” he says.
