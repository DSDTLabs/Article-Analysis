KOLKATA: The   ( ) and   (NKDA) have started identifying the spots in   that will be designated as bus stands for electric buses. The authorities have also started installing smart signs to intimate commuters about these stops.

 Hidco, along with  , recently procured three 32-seater electric buses to be used as public transport for the internal routes of New Town. Trials have been going on in full swing and the buses are now set for operations from next month. Officials said the buses have already got the safety certificates from the   in Pune and are going through the process of being registered with the PVD. Other factors like the range of travel, safety, speed and driver-helper shifts are being finalised before the buses are formally introduced for public transport.
 
 A committee comprising officials of Hidco, NKDA and a PVD representative will suggest routes and timings. “The electric buses will run on short routes along the internal roads of New Town to connect the three Action Areas. Since public buses do not ply on these roads, separate stops for the electric vehicles are needed,” said a Hidco official.
 
 “The stops for electric buses will be on the inner lanes of Action Area I and II, which join up with the main arterial road,” an official said.
 
 One of the bus stops will come up near Snehodiya, an apartment for senior citizens, and a sign has been put up.
 
 The air-conditioned electric buses have charging stations at the bus terminus in Action Area III, Pride Hotel Building bus terminus in Action Area 1 and near Eco Urban Village in Action Area II.
 
 Apart from electric buses, an app-based self-drive car rental company is also mulling the possibility of introducing self-driven electric vehicles on a public hiring scheme.
