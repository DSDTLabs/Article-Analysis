HYDERABAD: From being a millionaire at the age of 24 to facing bankruptcy and depression,  's life experiences have helped him script a book on how to motivate people to learn the power of gratitude. '  G - Gratitude for life fulfilment' was launched at the Hyderabad Literary Festival on Sunday.

 Outlining a path towards gratefulness in life, the entrepreneur-turned-author told TOI: "Gratitude helped me transform to live a more fulfilled life. After being on anti-depressants for three years, I decided to share my story with people so that it may help them too." 
 
 Jain conducted various experiments on gratitude, including conducting corporate sessions and teaching. The self-help book takes a reader through a decade of life experimentation and latest scientific research and knowledge, distilling thankfulness among people. 
 
 Through stories and exercises, the book covers all aspects of gratitude. "The 42 chapters in the book are essentially divided into six parts - attention, awareness, action, appreciation, acceptance and actualisation of gratitude," said Jain, adding that it can be read by anyone above 16 years of age. 
 
 Jain, along with his team, distributed 10,000 bands of gratitude at HLF. "The band stops you from complaining. When someone complaints, they must shift the band to the other hand. This exercise helps us gain an insight to the number of times people complaint," said Jain.
