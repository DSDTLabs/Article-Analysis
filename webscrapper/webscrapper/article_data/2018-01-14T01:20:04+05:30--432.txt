MUMBAI: An American national of Indian origin has pressed charges against her   after she was assaulted and thrown out of his suburban home along with her 11-year-old daughter on Saturday night. 

 The   police said the two had a dispute over property and finances. An FIR has been registered. 
 
 The woman had moved to the US over a decade ago where she got married and had a child. Her husband is an American. Two months ago, she came to Mumbai with her daughter. 
 
 She recently told a social activist from Khar that her father was to make investments on her behalf but he messed it up and hadnâ€™t returned her money. On December 26, she was allegedly assaulted by her father, a businessman. 
 
 On Saturday night, she and her daughter were thrown out of the house after the woman was pepper sprayed and beaten. Her clothes were torn in the melee. Her neighbours called up the activist who summoned the police. She told the activist that her father had brought in goons and a dozen women push her out of the house.
