Visakhapatnam: More than  ,000 invalid votes were cast in the MLC elections. As a result the administration was forced to go for second preferential vote to decide the winner. Counting of votes continued even after 36 hours due to this.

 The staff at the counting centre said the voters did not have any idea about how to exercise their franchise. Sources said most of the votes were invalid as the voters put a tick mark beside the candidate’s name they supported instead of enumerating their preferences.
 
 “The candidates should have created awareness among the voters,” election agent A Suresh said.
 
 The first MLC elections of graduate constituency had witnessed 2,849 invalid votes in 2007 after reintroduction of the Legislative Council, while the second elections had witnessed 5,282 invalid votes. After counting of the first preferential votes of eight rounds, TDP supported BJP candidate PVN Madhav (42,863 votes) was leading against his main opponent Avadhanula Aja Sarma (37,818 votes).
