BATHINDA: Three days after elections to the  , 35 of the 50 councillors of the  , cutting across party lines, started a campaign on Tuesday to  , the son of SAD’s MLA from Moga constituency Joginderpal Jain.

 Councillors, including those from SAD, gave a requisition notice to the municipal commissioner of the MC on Tuesday, asking him to convene a meeting where they could table a no-trust motion against Akshit. The move is said to have its roots in the rivalry between agriculture minister Tota Singh and Jain. Tota’s son Barjinder Singh was the Akali candidate from Moga this time. The faction owing allegiance to Tota is alleging that Jains did not work for the party in the February 4 elections.
 
 Tota has refuted the claims that the move was a fallout of the rivalry and said it was a decision of the councilors.
 
 Moga MC commissioner Harcharan Singh confirmed that 35 councillors had given him a notice. “As the code of conduct is still in place, I will approach higher authorities and the Election Commission for guidance on the issue,” he said.
 
 SAD councillors Bikkar Singh from Ward 20 and Parminder Singh from Ward 26 said Akshit had failed in executing development works in the town. “His working is not up to the mark, so we have decided to table a no-confidence motion against him,” they said.
 
 Akshit, however, described the move as political vendetta initiated by his family’s rivals in the party. “I was deputed in Jalalabad during elections. My father had gone to Canada. We worked for the party, still rivals are unnecessarily defaming us and want me to be unseated,” he said.
