CURCHOREM: Chief minister   came in for a lot of derision at a public meeting of the   (GSM) held at Curchorem on Sunday with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut and Goa prant rebel RSS chief Subhash Velingkar equating his behaviour to “monkey jumps” and MGP leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar calling him a “lump of jaggery”.

 “The U-turns by Parsekar are nothing but makad-uddea (monkey jumps). People are fed up with all these monkey jumps and BJP will be reduced to ashes in the upcoming elections,” Raut said in a fiery speech. 
 
 Sudin said, “The BJP placed a lump of jaggery as the chief minister. His sweetness only attracted unwanted elements and Goa was taken several years backwards.”
 
 Raut referred to Goa as the “land of gods” and urged people to bring in the GSM-MGP-SS government consisting of “god-like men”. 
 
 Velingkar promised to bring back the “golden land” of the erstwhile Dayanand Bandodkar era and restore Goa’s “ancient glory” if the alliance came to power. 
 
 Aditya Thackeray, son of Shiv Sena president Udhav Thackareay, put forth the idea of virtual classrooms, electric buses for public transport, and self-defence training for women, if the alliance came to power.
