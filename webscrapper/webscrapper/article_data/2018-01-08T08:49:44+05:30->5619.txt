UDAIUPUR/AMBASSA (Tripura): BJP national president   launched the saffron party's election campaign in Communist-ruled Tripura on Sunday with two rallies at tribal-dominated Ambassa and Udaipur with the battle cry of "chalo paltai (let us usher change)". 

 "What has the   government done in 25 years?" Shah asked the huge gathering at Udaipur, headquarters of the   district. Answering his own question, Shah trained guns on chief minister Manik Sarkar and said, "It would be unfair to say he hasn't done anything. He has robbed lakhs of people of crores through the Rose Valley scam." 
 
 The party supremo - accompanied by BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, Tripura election in-charge Himanta Biswa Sarma and state BJP president Biplab Kumar Deb - launched a four-pronged attack on the government's corruption record, failure to tackle crime, poor development and the absence of welfare programmes. 
 
 "Manik Sarkar has portrayed a falsely constructed image of the cleanest and poorest chief minister of the country, but after 20 years of his uninterrupted leadership, it has only been proven that he is the most corrupt and anti-development chief minister of the country," Shah said. 
 
 Implicating Sarkar for abetting the Rose Valley scam, Shah added, "  will not leave any of the accused who are involved in the chit fund scam of Tripura." He claimed Manik Sarkar did not allow the CBI to probe the scam in the state to save his cabinet colleagues and top leaders from CPM.
