CHENNAI: Ethical concerns push up costs : Would people be willing to pay 4 times the cost if it meant better treatment of animals? Well, customers of Happy Hens Farm, Vaer Organic, Omega 3, Ammapalayam are willing to pay as much as Rs 20 a egg of hens that are not caged.

 At the sylvan, green idyllic pastures of Darmona farms in Kotagiri,  , hens and roosters of the Aseel breed run free. The breed, originally from PunjabSindh area of Pakistan and India, typically lays brownish-black eggs. “Our dairy farm with freeranging cows is nearby so they go rooting in the dung for grub, insects, etc. 
 
 Apart from this we give them uncooked raw rice, small onions and pulses,“ says Dinesh Kumar, owner, Darmo na Estates. For Chennai customers like Bhavani S, the main reason for choosing freerange over cage-grown poultry is the ethical treatment. “In mass farms for broiler chickens, the poor things are cooped in tiny cages; barely able to stretch wings. 
 
 They are in filthy surrounding, pumped full of antibiotics and lead miserable lives. If I have to buy eggs, I'd rather buy from a farm that treats its animals well,“ she says.
