BENGALURU: What do elephants dream about? Do they think earth is their heaven or something else? What is the pain of a lone tusker stuck in a forest fire? You need to visit the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath (CKP) to know more about this.

 ‘Love for the Giants’, an art exhibition themed around human-elephant conflict in   and inaugurated on Sunday, showcases about 15 paintings and five potteries where every work puts across a strong message. Organized by Prank Abstracts and A  , a not-for-profit organization, the exhibition will be on till April 9.
 
 Artist  , whose paintings are on the display, said elephants always amazed him. “I knew my debut painting exhibition will be on this theme. I feel art as a medium is very strong when it comes to spreading awareness about a larger issue. All my paintings have drawn inspiration from real life incidents faced by elephants.” 
 
 Praveen, who is a director (Marketing) at city-based realty company, had been painting the canvas as a passion and when this passion got an inspiration, ‘Love for the Giants’ took shape.
 
 “The issue of human-elephant confict requires constant research and efforts. We still feel awareness amongst general public about the issue is limited and thus such exhibitions are very important,” said Prem Mitra, chairman, A Rocha India.
 
 The proceeds from the sale of art from the exhibition will be donated to A Rocha India for carrying out their research and efforts. The event was inaugurated by writer and film-maker  , actor  , and actress Jeevika.
