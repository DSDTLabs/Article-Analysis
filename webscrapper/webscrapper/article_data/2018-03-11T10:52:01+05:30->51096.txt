MYSUSRU: The inauguration of the new police commissioner office in   was postponed after chief minister  , who was on a whistle-stop tour of Mysuru inaugurating facilities and laying foundation stones to various developmental works, rushed back to Bengaluru late on Saturday. 

  Police commissioner A   confirmed to STOI that he was told by the CM's office at 8pm to postpone the inauguration as Siddaramaiah was busy. Sources said   was supposed to attend various programmes, but after inaugurating the Muslim cooperative building, he returned home. After the CM postponed the inauguration, rumours spread like wildfire that Siddaramaiah didn't go to the police comm issioner's office because the building has been built on a disputed site. However, Rao clarified that there was no legal issue concerning the property. 
 
 An activist fighting against the construction of the building had moved the high court, claiming that the office has been built on land that was earmarked for a park. The case will come up for hearing on March 21, sources added.
