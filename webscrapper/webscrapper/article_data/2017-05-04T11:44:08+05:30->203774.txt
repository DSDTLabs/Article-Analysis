NAGPUR: As many as 373 posts, 151   and 222 teaching, are   at   (NU). But, the   has not allowed the varsity to fill up even half of the posts. 

 The NU was allowed to advertise only 63 teaching and 23 posts of non-teaching posts. Lack of manpower has adversely the functioning of NU, especially its  , which directly affects the students.
 
 An RTI query filed by activist Abhay Kolarkar revealed the about number of vacancies. In its reply, NU stated that out 476 class-III posts, 325 are filled up and 151 are vacant. The situation of Class-IV is slightly better, out of 228 posts, 48 are vacant.
 
 Out of 465 posts of teaching staff, only 243 are filled. NUâ€™s that about 72 teaching posts were filled up in 2013 during the tenure of then vice chancellor Vilas Sapkal.
 
 After an inordinate delay of over two years, NU had invited application for 63 teaching posts which included professor, associate professor, assistant professor, and director for its various postgraduate departments and conducted colleges. 
 
 Fortunately, NU had issued the advertisement on February 28, just a day before the new Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 was implemented.
 
 NU officials said that advertising the posts on the last day of Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994 was strongly opposed and many had even complained to the government and the chancellor.
 
 They added that there was an urgent need to fill up both teaching and non-teaching posts because many employees had either retired or were about to retire. 
 
 The VC SP Kane and pro-VC Pramod Yeole had expressed concern over shortage of employees. With the new Act coming into force, many new positions have also been added.
 
 Officials said the non-teaching posts were not filled up for years owing to various problems and later due to roster scam, first exposed by TOI in 2009.
