LUCKNOW: As mercury continued to soar, Tuesday became the hottest day in the month of March in the past seven years. Temperatures are expected to rise further on Wednesday and Thursday, indicating an early arrival of summer this year. The maximum temperature on Tuesday rose to 38.7 degree Celsius, four degrees above normal. Night was also hot with minimum temperature 20.2 degree Celsius, three degrees above normal. Usually such high temperatures are seen during the third and last week of April. 

 The sky is expected to be mainly clear on Wednesday with maximum and minimum temperatures around 39 and 20 degree Celsius respectively. Earlier, it was in 2010 when the maximum temperature in March had crossed 40 degree Celsius mark.
 
 On Tuesday, people felt uncomfortable also because of the high humidity during the day. State Met director J P Gupta said temperatures are above normal for the past one week because of several western disturbances which hit the hill region one after another. They blocked the flow of northwesterly cold winds towards the plains. On Tuesday, moisture-laden easterly winds also entered the state, leading to rise in humidity. Temperatures will rise further in the next few days but will be stable thereafter.
