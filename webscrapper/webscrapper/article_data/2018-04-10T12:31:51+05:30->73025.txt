LUDHIANA: Traders in Ludhiana have come out in opposition to the state government’s plan to introduce e-way billing system for transactions within Punjab from June 1.

 The state government launched e-way bills for inter-state transactions above Rs 50,000 nearly a week ago. Since then, 2 lakh bills have already been generated in the state.
 
 The chairperson of Knitwear Club, Vinod Thapar, said no businessperson was against complying with taxes, but e-way billing was “very complicated”. “I don’t think e-way bills should be made mandatory for intra-state transactions; it is not possible for small traders to follow it, considering the fact that the person wanting to generate e-way needs to have access to computer and printer, along with having full knowledge about how to generate the bill,” Thapar said.
 
 The president of   (UCPMA), Inderjit Singh Navyug, said imposition of e-way bills on intra-state transactions would be a hindrance in local trade. “It will increase the number of formalities for businessmen. We appeal to the state government and Centre to scrap the Rs 50,000 exemption limit,” he said.
 
 Jagbir Singh Sokhi, the president of  , said inclusion of local transactions would add to the burden on e-way billing. “Though we are not facing much trouble right now, the situation could worsen with this move,” he said.
 
 Sokhi added that traffic on the   portal would increase with the move. “It will also lead to technical problems, like frequent server breakdowns and slow processing. Also, how can the government expect small traders to use this system 2-3 times daily without having any infrastructure required for it?” he said.
