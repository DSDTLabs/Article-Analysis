NAMAKKAL: South India LPG tanker truck owners on Saturday announced their plans to go on an indefinite strike from Sunday against the central government’s move to overhaul the existing tender system, saying it would cause a huge financial loss to them.

 President of Southern Region Bulk LPG Transport Operators Association M   said at least 4,500 LPG tanker trucks would remain off the roads from Sunday.
 
 
 Pointing out that oil companies such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and   so far used to float tenders zonewise, i.e., for South India, North India, Central India and Western India, he said, “Now, the central government and the oil companies are trying to float tenders statewise.”
 
 This would mean that   registered LPG tanker trucks can participate only in tenders floated in TN and not in other states. “As per the existing system, we can participate in tenders floated in Karnataka or  ,” he explained.
 
 According to a source, Namakkal-based owners have purchased 3,000 new tanker trucks expecting huge demand in view of the Prime Minister’s scheme to provide LPG connection to all houses. “The new trucks will be of no use if we accept the new tender system,” Ponnambalam said.
