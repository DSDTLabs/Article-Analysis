INDORE: The first exclusive emporium of bamboo items in the state, ‘Bansi Emporium’ was inaugurated at   on Friday, offering an eco-friendly replacement to all plastic and steel made household items like spoons, plates and trays. 

 The emporium has been set up under the State Bamboo Mission. The items, displayed in the emporium, have been designed by 35 bamboo craftsmen who have been trained in product designing from   in Ahmedabad. On the lines of Indore, similar showrooms will be opened in  , Rewa, Satna and Harda. 
 
 “There are two major objectives of beginning this showroom. Firstly, the products being sold here help in conservation of energy and secondly, they boost the financial strength of the poor strata of the society,” MP state bamboo mission director BB   said. 
 
 According to the concept shared in the bamboo mission, items made using plastic and metals need huge amounts of energy and in comparison, bamboo products can be made easily. 
 
 “The plastic and metal products are made by rich industrialists, and are purchased by poor people, resulting in flow of money from poor to the rich. Bamboo products are made by poor village people and are purchased by comparatively richer urban populace, thus reversing the flow of money from rich to the poor, helping economy get balanced,” Singh said. 
 
 The bamboo showroom in Indore exhibits many such products which can be used to replace existing metal and plastic items in households. The bamboo centre also introduces jewellery made using bamboo, along with show pieces and gift articles.
