HYDERABAD: Casual smoking seems to be on the rise among young working women in India's major cities, a new survey released on International Women's Day revealed. 

 Owing to job stress, peer pressure and the 'cool factor' working as the booster, the survey conducted by the Association Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India on 2,000 women in the age group of 22 to 30, revealed while the number of heavy smokers was only two percent, women with light and very light smoking habit were as high as 52%.
 
 The survey was conducted to analyse the smoking pattern among young working women in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Pune.
 
 "Growing number of young working women, mostly with high paying jobs and an active life, are indulging in social smoking but they must realise it is 'uncool' and that they are placing their heart-health at risk by occasionally indulging in cigarettes," secretary general of  , said. During the survey, some women claimed smoking to be a stress-buster while for some, smoking had a 'cool' factor, associated with feelings of attractiveness, independence and sophistication.

Talking about the effects of smoking, he said, "The effects of this will last with you whether you quit smoking or you don't, and if you don't, further damage will take place."
