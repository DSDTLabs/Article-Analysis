NEW DELHI: The   tried to turn tables on BJP on Wednesday as the culture ministry told the   that Sita’s birthplace in   in Bihar is a “matter of faith”.

 Responding to a question from BJP MP   on whether archaeological excavation had been undertaken near Sitamarhi, minister for culture Mahesh Sharma said in a written reply: “Sita’s birthplace is a matter of faith, which does not depend on any direct proof. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has not carried out any excavation in Sitamarhi district till now and hence it does not have any historical evidence of Sitamarhi being Sita’s birthplace.”
 
 The answer also stated that Valmiki Ramayana does mention the Mithila region as the birthplace of Sita.
 
 Sharma’s reply irked several opposition members. Congress member Digvijaya Singh demanded an apology from the minister for hurting his religious sentiments about Sita’s birthplace.
 
 “To say that the birthplace of Sita, wife of Lord Rama, is a matter of faith means even Lord Rama is a matter of faith for the government. Do they have any evidence of Rama marrying Sita?” Singh asked, mentioning that BJP has come to power by politically using issues such has Ram temple and Ram Setu.
 
 As Sharma came under attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had just come to the House, was seen asking finance minister Arun Jaitley to show him the ques-tion that was being discussed at the moment. Going a step further, JD(U) lawmaker Anil Kumar Sahani criticised Sharma saying the government’s reply that Sita’s birthplace is a matter of faith puts a question mark on Lord Ram as well. Sahni also alleged that ASI has a habit of “disrespecting women”.
 
 As Sahani said Sita’s name comes before Ram, CPM’s   quipped that “though he is a communist”, he was named Sitaram.
