COIMBATORE: In a veiled threat to the   government in the state, Sulur AIADMK MLA   threatened to quit his party for allegedly allowing   in his constituency. Soon after inspecting the quarry on Saturday night where two workers died after boulders fell on them,   demanded that the state government should immediately close the quarry. He said he would quit the party if it fails to do so. In a further ultimatum to the AIADMK high command, Kanagaraj said he would join hands with "those who serve the people." 

 The stone quarry, located at Pachapalayam near Periyakuyili, is run by DMK functionary   of Senjerimalai. Anandakumar had previous enmity with Kanagaraj. On March 17, two workers - Balan, 50, and Sakthivel, 40, both from Kanakkampatti near Palani in Dindigul district - suffered severe injuries after boulders fell on them at the stone quarry. The duo was taken to the   and Hospital (CMCH) where they died without responding to treatment. The family members of the duo were given Rs 3 lakh each. After participating in an inaugural ceremony of new buildings at Codissia here on Saturday, Kangaraj went to the stone quarry and conducted an inspection.
