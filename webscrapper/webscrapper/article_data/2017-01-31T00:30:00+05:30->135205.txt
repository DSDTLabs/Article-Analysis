Pune: Consumer durables financier,  , on Monday posted a 36% growth in its third quarter net   helped by higher demand for consumer durables loans during the festive season and the days following demonetisation.

 In the three month period ended December 31, 2016, the company posted a   profit of Rs 556 crore against Rs 408 crore in the same period the previous year.
 
 The company’s assets under management rose by a third to Rs 57,605 crore as on end December 2016 from Rs 43,452 crore in the same quarter a year ago.
 
 Bajaj Finance said it booked 2.88 million new loans in the third quarter against 2.13 million new loans during the same period in 2015. During the quarter, the company said it acquired 1.17 million new customers.
 
 The pace of customer acquisition or new loan acquisition was, however, slower for the company in the third quarter compared to the previous few quarters as demonetisation hit consumer sentiment in the second half of the quarter.
