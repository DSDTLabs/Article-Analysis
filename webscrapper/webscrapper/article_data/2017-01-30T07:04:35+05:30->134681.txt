HYDERABAD: The decision of the   to restrict the number of   ( ) attempts to three, has garnered a mixed response among medical aspirants and teachers from the city.

 While teachers maintain that the move will make candidates more focused, students say that they must be granted at least a couple of more chances to pursue their dreams.
 
 “Last year, the qualifying mark for NEET was 145 out of 720, which is just 20 per cent of the total marks. So, if a student doesn't even get those 20 per cent marks in three attempts, then he is not qualified to be a doctor,“ said Dr B Karunakar Reddy , Vice Chancellor, Kaloji Narayana Rao  .
 
 Seconding Rao, Dr N Yadaiah, convener of TS EAMCET 2017, said, “Personally, I feel that if a student doesn't get a seat even after three attempts, heshe should start looking for other career options."
 
 However, other educationalists opined that students from rural India and those studying in vernacular medium schools could be adversely impacted by this move as they might require more time to succeed in this `alien' test.“For students from rural India and those studying in Telugu medium, this move will serve as a jolt as they might need more time to prepare for this test. But for the rest who have access to quality education, the cap on attempts should not be a problem,“ said Dheeraj Kumar Misra, regional director (operations), South Zone for Aakash Educational Services Pvt Ltd.
 
 Ch Prasanna, who took a year off to prepare for NEET, said, “Last year, we were forced to appear for NEET without proper preparation and lost a chance to secure a rank.Now, it is scary to think that I will have only one more chance to prove myself if I fail this time.“
 
 Another student, N Swetha, pursuing her intermediate first year in   said: “Now, with a cap on attempts, I will start preparing for NEET from this year itself so that I can achieve my goal.“
 
 The decision to introduce acap on attempts to appear for the test and introduce an upper age limit was taken during a meeting conducted by UGC in Delhi on January 24, 2017.The maximum age limit to appear for NEET for unreserved candidates will be 25 years, while the minimum age will be 17 years.
