CHANDIGARH: Keeping an eye on the 2019 elections, Aam Aadmi Party ( ) convener and Delhi chief minister   on Saturday assured Rs 1 crore ex gratia for the kin of martyrs and asked the youths to aspire for dream careers, saying that the party would help them achieve their goals. Kejriwal stated this at various places during a roadshow put up by him, which started from Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district and ended at Siwani in Bhiwani district.

 Amid loud slogans, Kejriwal started his show with drum beats from the inter-state barrier of Bahadurgarh. Accompanied by senior office-bearers of AAP and its   incharge Naveen  , Kejriwal halted at over 24 places in Rohtak, Dadri and Bhiwani before reaching Siwani, his native town. “The AAP government is the only which has given Rs 1 crore to the kin of martyrs. So far, as the BJP and   governments are concerned, they have failed to perform their responsibilities. Prime Minister   advises the educated youth to sell pakoras while Congress has its own issues,” he said.
 
 He said they proved it in Delhi and now they would advise the youths of Haryana to dream big in careers and if voted to power, then the AAP government in the state would help them in achieving it. Kejriwal also complimented the AAP state machinery for the success of the Hisar rally. He asked the state party chief Jaihind and workers to start working for ‘Mission 2019’, aiming at both Lok Sabha and assembly elections in Haryana.
 
 After tasting defeat in the previous Lok Sabha polls from Haryana, AAP did not contest the October 2014 assembly elections in the state.
