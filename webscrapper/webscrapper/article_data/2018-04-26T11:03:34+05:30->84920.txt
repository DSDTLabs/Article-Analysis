CHANDIGARH: The city is coming under the grip of organised crime with   cartels trying to get a hold over the city, said a sub-committee of the administrator’s advisory council on Wednesday.

 Headed by former IPS officer  , the sub-committee on law and order that took part in the advisory council meeting with the UT administrator along with eight other committees said the number of drug addicts has increased. The remarks come at a time when Chandigarh has witnessed a spurt in cases of carjackings, robberies, kidnappings and shootings.
 
 
  
 
 The committee also questioned the large number of paying guest (PG) accommodations, saying these are being used by criminals.
 
 The committee also said the number of senior citizens is very large and they are a very vulnerable section of the society. “Some have become victims. They have been assaulted and robbed,” the subcommittee said. Moreover, colonies in the periphery of Chandigarh are used as safe havens for nefarious activities, said the sub-committee.
 
 Later, giving suggestions, the sub-committee suggested that many officials are aware of drug peddlers and the route they take to smuggle narcotics into Chandigarh. A meeting with para legal volunteers and SHOs should be organised soon so that they can interact in a professional manner. Policing at ground level needs improvement and there should be more police presence and visibility on ground zero, and there should be more interaction with police and public, the panel suggested.
