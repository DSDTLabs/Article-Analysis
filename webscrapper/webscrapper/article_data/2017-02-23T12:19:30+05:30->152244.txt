NAGPUR: An offence was registered against  , BJP candidate from ward no. 13   and their accomplices at   station on Tuesday following a complaint by   for assault, rioting and hurling abuses. Waghade claimed that he was assaulted while trying to rescue former BJP candidate Ghanshyam Choudhari from the wrath of Fuke and others.

 While Fuke has denied the charges, it has come to fore that Choudhari and Waghade were dragged out of a car and thrashed at Verma Layout when they were heading towards an apartment after receiving information regarding bogus voters on the polling day. It is reliably learnt that there is already a litigation pending between Chaudhari and Fuke. Ambazari police have issued summons to Fuke and others to record their statement.
