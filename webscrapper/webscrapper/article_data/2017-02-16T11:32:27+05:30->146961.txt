There’s nothing better than literally stepping into your father’s shoes.   had an opportunity to do that when he shot the street-style dance number, 'Ding Dang', for Sabbir Khan’s ' ' last week. The song pays tribute to   and his bindaas attitude and style. 
The film, produced by   and Viki Rajani, has been partially shot at Teen Batti Chawl in South Mumbai, where Jackie once lived. “We styled Tiger in a manner similar to his father back in the day. The dance moves have also been designed keeping Jaggu dada in mind,” says Sabbir, adding, “Tiger somewhat looks like his dad from Hero. He has even spoken in that lukkha lingo and does it well.”
 Ayesha Shroff, who has witnessed her husband and son’s careers, points out, “Tiger is as old as his father was when he acted in 'Hero'. Tiger started out much younger, though. And yes, he has begun to resemble his father a lot more now. They share personality traits and features, but when I saw the 'Munna Michael' song that he shot for last week, I was stunned. He has paid homage to Jackie and how! Tiger totally reminds me of Jackie from Hero, particularly the stubble, hairdo, his eyes and the clothes. It’s amazing how he’s pulled it off.”
