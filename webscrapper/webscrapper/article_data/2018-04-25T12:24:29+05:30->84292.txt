IMPHAL: Various human rights bodies of the state have demanded fitting punishment for   authorities after an Imphal-based daily quoted Naib Subedar   Sharma of 30 Battalion Assam Rifles (AR) who revealed how paramilitary officials procure illegal weapons and stage encounters to get promotion by unfair means. 

 "Assam Rifles officials are involved in fake encounters and staging surrender dramas. We appreciate Ramesh Chand for revealing the truth," Babloo Loitongbam, executive director of Human Rights Alert (HRA) told TOI. "He (Ramesh) is a whistle-blower who came out for justice. We demand exemplary punishment for all officers and others involved in procuring illegal arms for staging fake encounters and surrender programmes," Babloo added. 
 
 Ramesh has revealed that during his posting near   in February 2013, he received Rs three lakh from his commandant at Mantripukhri and under the command of his senior officers, he handed over the amount to a surrendered militant. Along with some other surrendered militants, Ramesh and his AR team then reportedly received two unmarked pistols and a Lathod gun from the Pallel AR post in Chandel district.
 
 Later, Ramesh handed over the unregistered weapons to his second-in-command and deposited the same at the post. He also disclosed that there were 23 unregistered weapons, including Chinese hand grenades at the post's armoury, for using them in fake encounters and surrender occasions. Ramesh told the daily that "he was not afraid to expose the truth as he stands firm in his belief that justice will be done."
 
 A top police officer said they cannot intervene into the matter based on a news report. "According to the news report, the incident concerns Assam Rifles personnel. But we will probe into it only if we receive a complaint," he said.
