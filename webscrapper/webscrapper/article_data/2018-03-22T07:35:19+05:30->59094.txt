PUNE: The   police on Tuesday booked a site contractor for neglecting safety measures at a construction site in Dhayari which resulted in the death of a woman home buyer on March 4. 

 Manasi   (28), a homemaker from Aundh, slipped and fell to her death from an open balcony on the sixth floor of the construction site. The police had registered a case of accidental death and were investigating.
 
 The police probe revealed that the underconstruction building had no safety measures. 
 
 
 
 
 There were no railings around the open balconies or any warning boards around such spots. There were also no proper safety measures for the workers at the site, police said.
 
 Assistant inspector Jyoti Gadkari of the Sinhagad Road police station told TOI, “On March 4, Dabhade visited the site to see an apartment and the construction work. She had booked a 1BHK apartment in one of the two underconstruction buildings at the site and had taken the builder’s permission to see the apartment. After seeing the apartment, she walked out of the building around 5.30pm,” she said.
 
 “Dabhade then entered the neighbouring 13-storied construction building. She went to the open balcony of an apartment on the sixth floor to check the view outside. Somehow she lost her balance and fell,” Gadkari said.
 
 “The site contractor had not taken precautions to put railings or safety nets,” Gadkari said.
 
 “The area from where Dabhade fell was kept open to facilitate the movement of the construction material elevator.”
 
 In January last year, a 50-yearold homemaker, who had gone to see a sample flat at an under-construction skyscraper at Paud Phata here, died after she fell from the ninth floor of the building.
 
 Police had registered a case under section 304(A) of the Indian Penal Code (causing death by negligence) against four employees of the builder.
