 His family back home in Godhra is completely shattered. “His leave was approved and he had been telling us over last one month that he would come soon. But the army man who was to replace him couldn’t reach the post due to bad weather. Who knew my son will return like this. He was very young and had joined army just five years ago. Sunil’s wife’s health deteriorated after she learnt about his death,” said Takhatsinh Patel, the grieving father. 
 
 Sunil got married in 2011 and soon after received the call to join the force. “I wanted him to join civil services, but Sunil wanted to be in army. May be it was due to family influence as many of our family members are in army. He wanted to serve the country,” Takhatsinh, a retired subedar of Indian Army, added. The deceased’s uncle, brother-in-law and some other relatives are in the Indian Army.
 
 “I had got a call on Thursday to inform us that Sunil was missing along with some other jawans and a search was on to find them. On Friday, we were told that his body has been recovered,” Takhatsinh told TOI. Survived by a three-year-old daughter and wife, Sunil’s body is expected to arrive in Godhra within next few days. In fact, the local authorities are busy preparing a road as Sunil’s village is 15 kilometre away from the main road and the 2-km stretch leading to Orvada isn’t motorable.
