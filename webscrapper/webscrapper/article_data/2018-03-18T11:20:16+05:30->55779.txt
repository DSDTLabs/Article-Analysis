COIMBATORE: The unregistered open-air gym functioning on corporation land at Race Course was vandalised on Friday by a group of people.

 Following the incident, gym regulars petitioned the city corporation authorities against the ‘hooliganism’, saying it had been functioning for more than 15 years and people from all walks of life were free to use it from 4am-9am and 4pm-9pm every day.
 
 The gym, they said, wasn’t registered and various equipment were bought with the money donated by several walkers and like-minded people in Race Course area.
 
 “More than 500 people work out here daily and no one has the rights to destroy it. By spreading rumours and destroying equipment at the gym, they cannot stop people from coming here,” said 46-year-old  .
 
 For 50-year-old A Sheik Dawood, the sight of damaged gym equipment was heart-wrenching. “Working out here had been my routine for several years. We put in our money and efforts to develop this facility,” he said.
 
 Shiva Kumar said a few people, who claimed to be members of the ruling  , used to collect money from the people for using the facility. “When we questioned it, they abused us. They then began to threaten the people coming to the gym. We never imagined that they would take the rivalry to this extent. This is a public space. Providing wrong information to authorities and destroying the facility cannot be accepted,” said C  , a fitness enthusiast.
