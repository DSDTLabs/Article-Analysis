Bathinda: Students of Central University, Punjab, (CUP) here organised a round of the National Youth Parliament on Monday. The university has reached the final round of the youth parliament featuring 15 teams from different universities and colleges from across the country. Former MP Rajdev Singh Khalsa and a representative of the Union parliamentary affairs ministry were present, along with   vice-chancellor R K Kohli, during the youth parliament session.

 Three days ago a similar round of the youth parliament was organised at Rajiv Gandhi National Law University in Patiala. “We are delighted to pose as elected members. We extensively studied the way the parliament functions and worked out minute details to work like that. With the youth parliament the students not only understand the democratic and parliamentary system but also it makes way for youths to choose politics as a career to serve the country. We are delighted that our university has reached the final round,” said a student, who was a part of the youth parliament.
 
 Khalsa appreciated the role played by students and asked them to seriously study the parliamentary system so that the elected representatives could be asked to work for the welfare of people.
