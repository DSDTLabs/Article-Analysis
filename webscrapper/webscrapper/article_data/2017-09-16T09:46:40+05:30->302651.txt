CHENNAI: A 50-year-old businessman jumped into the   river from the Kotturpuram bridge on Friday evening, allegedly upset over mounting debts. The rescue operation was delayed by close to an hour and the body was yet to be traced till last reports came in. A case is yet to be registered.

 Around 5pm, police said, Mohan Kumar of Lotus Colony in   was seen strolling up down the pavement adjoining the bridge for at least 15 minutes. He then climbed up the parapet wall and plunged down 15 feet.
 
 A friend who noticed him came over and asked why was walking up and down the pavement. Mohan Kumar simply handed over his cellphone and a card and jumped into the river, police said, based on the friend’s statement.
 
 The man, taken aback by Kumar’s sudden action, cried for help and several passersby gathered at the spot. Some in the crowd alerted the fire and rescue services personnel, but a team arrived at the scene only 45 minutes later.
 
 The rescue personnel went in a boat looking for Kumar but in vain. “The operation was stopped late in the evening due to lack of illumination,” said a police officer.
 
 Police sources said Kumar was upset after a few people who lent him money came home and asked him to return the sum. “He appeared depressed since then,” said a friend.
 
 The bridge is infamous as a suicide spot, with at least 30 people attempting suicide in the past five years. In December 2012 carnatic vocalist Nithyasree Mahadevan’s husband jumped to his death from atop the bridge. In 2015, the corporation proposed to build a 6-ft-high wall along the bridge but the proposal is still pending.
