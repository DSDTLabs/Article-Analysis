Erode: It was dream come true for Kamal Hassan’s hard core fan Kamalakkannan, who had been waiting for the actor to name his baby girl. Though the actor was surprised to hear that Kamalakkannan was yet to name his 10-month-old daughter, he happily accepted the latter’s request to name her.

  Kamal subsequently named the toddler Kamalaranjitham. The family said they were happy that the actor has accepted their request readily.
