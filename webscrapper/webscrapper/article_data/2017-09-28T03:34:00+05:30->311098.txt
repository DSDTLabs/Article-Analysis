Panaji: A full-fledged, 24-hour suicide prevention   that will be run by a separate cell of the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour (IPHB), Bambolim, is in the pipeline. The proposal has been put forth to the government and is awaiting approval. The institute is also in the process of being upgraded. It will comprise a 100-bed facility, which will include a separate ward for children, within the campus. Considering the lack of manpower when it comes to working in the field of mental health, the institute is looking at starting three courses: MPhil in clinical psychology, MPhil in psychiatric social work and a diploma in psychiatric nursing. The government has already created six faculty positions for this purpose, IPHB director and dean Dr Pradip Naik, said. tnn
