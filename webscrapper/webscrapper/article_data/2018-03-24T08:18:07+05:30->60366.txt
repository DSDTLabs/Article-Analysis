AHMEDABAD: As many as 11 companies have evinced interest in supplying   to Gujarat Urja   (GUVNL), which last month invited bids from solar power developers to supply 500MW to the state-run utility. The tender floated by GUVNL also had a greenshoe option of additional 500MW.

 “The last date for bid submission was March 22 and 11 companies have submitted their bids. The reverse auction will be conducted on March 28,” said a source close to the development.
 
 The bidders include Adani Green Energy, Azure Power, ReNew Power and Fortum among others. “Some public sector companies have also participated in the bidding process,” he added.
 
 With these companies offering three times the capacity being auctioned, GUVNL also expects that the greenshoe option of extra 500MW will also be fully subscribed and the state-owned electricity body will be able to tie-up 1,000MW of solar power capacity.
 
 GUVNL has also invited bids for procuring wind power of 1,000MW (including 500MW greenshoe option) through competitive bidding. The deadline for bid submission is April 17.
 
 Last year, GUVNL awarded contracts to private and public sector companies for supply of 500MW each from wind and solar power projects.
 
 In order to meet its renewable energy purchase target, which is set by the   (GERC), GUVNL has been aggressively tying up wind and solar power capacities through competitive bidding. The apex electricity company in the state plans to procure 7,000MW of renewable power by 2022, including 5,500MW from solar and 1,500 from wind power projects.
 
 At present, the total installed power generation capacity is 1,420MW in Gujarat, which was once the top solar power generating state. Since 2015, other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and   have been adding more capacity, Gujarat ranked fifth as on October 2017.
