IMPHAL: Taking other political parties by surprise,   candidates  , Erendro Leichombam and Najma Bibi on Thursday signed affidavits promising that they will maintain transparency in funds allocation if they are elected.

 Straight after releasing their 10-point poll manifesto at the   in  , the trio, along with their supporters and wellwishers, moved to the Cheirap court complex here and signed the affidavits before the oath commissioner.
 
 The affidavit reads, "That in the event of my election as a member of legislative assembly, I shall faithfully and sincerely discharge my duty as a member of such august house. This is true to my knowledge." They shall make the appropriation of MLA Local Area Development Fund (LADF) and other funds transparent and accountable to the people of this state at large, the affidavit added.
 
 "That in the event of my failure to make the appropriation of MLA Local Area Development Fund and other funds transparent and accountable, I shall resign from the membership of the Assembly and I may be prosecuted under relevant penal laws," the legal paper said. 
 
 Erendro, a Harvard University alumnus, dared other candidates to sign similar affidavits if they really want to serve the people and bring about true democracy. While Elendro is contesting from the Thangmeiband seat, Sharmila is taking on chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh from Thoubal. Women and child activist Najima Bibi is fighting from the Wabagai seat.
