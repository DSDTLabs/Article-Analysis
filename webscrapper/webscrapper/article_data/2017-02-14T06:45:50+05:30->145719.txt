ISLAMABAD: The   high court on Monday banned Valentine’s Day celebrations across the country after accepting a petition which argued that it was un-Islamic. Valentine’s Day has been a subject of verbal sparring between liberals and conservatives in the country. 

 But, backing the orthodox religionists, the court banned any celebration of the day in public spaces and government offices on February 14 with “immediate effect”, warning electronic and print media against giving coverage to any promotion of the day.
 
 Justice  , who was hearing the petition filed by a citizen,  , directed the information ministry, federal government, and   to submit their replies regarding the immediate execution of the court’s order.
 
 Last year, President Mamnoon Hussain had called on the Islamic republic to avoid any celebration of Valentine’s Day, arguing that its sentiment had no connection with Islamic culture. 
 
 For a President who does not often speak in public, this rare statement was aimed at appeasing conservatives known to take anti-Valentine’s Day protests to violent extremes.
