GUWAHATI: With the NSCN(IM)-Centre peace deal not making any headway,   on Tuesday asked the Nagas to seek an early and amicable settlement. Addressing a large gathering of   at Mokokchung on the occasion of the Ao festival Moatsu in the morning, Liezietsu said, "The Nagas have been suffering for too long and we want an early solution which is amicable and honourable." 

 He added, "Let's do our best to be in a position of a civilised state because fighting for supremacy in a family can never help to move ahead, it can never compete with other people of the country. Each one of us need to contribute our best to see that the Naga political issue is solved once and for all. Each one of us have a role. If there is no peace, there cannot be progress and development," he said, echoing his party's (Naga People's Front) slogan of 'development for peace, peace for development."
 
 Liezietsu recalled how 2000-odd Nagas, who were taken to European warfronts during World War I, returned with the realization that the Nagas were different from other people. The CM recently unveiled a monolith for   in Kohima. "After these Nagas came back, they officially formed the Naga Club in 1919 through which awareness was created for the Nagas to move towards togetherness and also the political consciousness to stay as one people. Through their trip to France, they've put their ideas of the sense of family into action," he said.
