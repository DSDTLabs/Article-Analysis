Vadodara: In the ongoing investigations of corruption rot in Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA), the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) is gathering evidences against officials of the body whose involvement is suspected.

 ACB sources said that they are gathering evidences against top three officials whose involvement in the ‘well-oiled’ corrupt practices have been admitted by suspended planning assistant engineer R C Shah. He had named chief executive officer (CEO) of VUDA Dr N K Meena, town planning officer A Krishna Rao and assistant town planner A C Vyas during the probe.
 
 Shah and his accomplice Chirag Patel had also told the investigating agency that at least five other officials in VUDA of planning assistant engineer rank have also been extracting money from builders and other applicants for clearing their files. Officials are questioning the duo to know the names of these officials and are also trying to identify their middlemen.
 
 The duo will be presented in the court on Wednesday as their custody period will end. ACB sources said that the agency is unlikely to request for further custody of the two accused.
