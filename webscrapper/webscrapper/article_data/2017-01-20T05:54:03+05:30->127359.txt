KOLKATA: On a day when a Trinamool delegation met President   at Raj Bhawan, alleging “political victimization by BJP”, the saffron patry’s state president   resonated the same allegation against Trinamool to his party president   in Delhi.

 A Barasat court sent BJP’s state vice-president Jayprakash Majumdar to two-day police custody, and three separate complaints were filed in Kharagpur against Ghosh. One of those was lodged by Trinamool-controlled Kharagpur Municipality chairperson Pradip Sarkar who feared a “threat to his life from Ghosh”.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP’s north Bengal MLA Manoj Tigga complained that he was roughed up and his vehicle ransacked by Trinamool supporters in Madarihat.
 
 Also, the   has again shot off its appear-in-person summon to Union minister and Asansol MP Babul Supriyo. The police want Babul to appear before it on Tuesday for questioning in the FIR lodged by Trinamool’s Mahua Moitra.
 
 “There is a pattern to it.   believes that by getting police to probe trumped up charges against our party leaders, she will slow down the pace of CBI — and ED — probe into the role of her party leaders in the Ponzi mess. This will never happen. BJP will fight these organizationally and legally,” said Sidharthnath Singh, the party national secretary. It isn’t curious therefore that Ghosh left for New Delhi this morning with a dossier on all criminal charges against him — and the state party leaders — after Trinamool MPs Tapas Paul and Sudip Bandyopadhyay were arrested. 
 
 The denial of police permission to Ghosh, and party national secretary Rahul Sinha, to hold public rallies has also been cited.
