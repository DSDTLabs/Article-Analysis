PUNE: Continuing their aggressive stance against the Bharatiya Janata Party, Shiv Sena leaders on Wednesday alleged that the   was trying to establish a ‘gundaraj’ in the city by giving tickets to goons and those having criminal background.

 The Sena also claimed that the BJP had a secret pact with the Nationalist   and that both the parties would come together after elections. “There was no question of joining hands with the BJP post elections,” Sena leaders said while speaking to reporters after the party released its manifesto for the city for the next five years. 
 
 The Sena has been finding fault with the BJP ever since party   announced that his party would go alone in the upcoming civic polls. The party’s city unit chief Vinayak Nimhan said partymen were happy with the split. “Sena has fielded more candidates than the BJP and the NCP in the city. The party will win a maximum number of seats as citizens are unhappy with the secret NCP-BJP tie-up, which has been stalling the city’s development for the last many years,” he said. 
 
 Nimhan, however, refused to reply when asked whether BJP would be the party’s main opponent in the elections. “There is no main or second number opponent for us. Those who are stalling city’s growth are our opponents. We are ready to take on anyone,” he said.
 
 Sena MLC   said the BJP has given entry to goons in its party by giving them tickets. This cannot go with the city’s culture. People will not accept BJP’s agenda. “The BJP-NCP tie-up will not benefit the city. Citizens should remain alert from such pacts,” she said.
 
  said there was huge unrest among BJP workers, resulting in protests and agitations, when candidatures were announced. This clearly reflects where the party is heading, he said.
