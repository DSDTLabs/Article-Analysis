New Delhi: A Delhi court on Monday dismissed AAP   Somnath Bharti’s plea seeking further investigation in a case of alleged molestation of African   during a raid in the city. 

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Samar Vishal dismissed the application, saying the points sought to be probed further were not relevant for the purpose of prosecution and that Bharti would get an opportunity to defend himself during the trial. “There is no need for prolonging this matter by directing further investigation on the points raised by the applicant (Bharti) as neither they are relevant for the purpose of prosecution nor are the facts that need police assistance to unearth them,” the court said.
 
 Bharti had alleged that the police had suppressed several facts that need to be probed. He also claimed that he was falsely implicated. In September 2014, Delhi Police had filed a chargesheet alleging that “nine   women were survivors of molestation and manhandling by a mob led by then law minister Somnath Bharti”. Bharti and 17 others were booked under various sections of IPC, including 354 (outraging women’s modesty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 147 (rioting).
