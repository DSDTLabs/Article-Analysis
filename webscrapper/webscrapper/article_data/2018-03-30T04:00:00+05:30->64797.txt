Coimbatore: Raising funds from equity markets touched an all-time high of about Rs 1.8 lakh crore during 2017-18. The amount raised was 3.5 times the money mobilised during 2016-17, and beat the previous high of Rs 86,710 crore achieved in 2009-10.

 Money raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) also hit a record Rs 84,357 crore during 2017-18. This is more than double the amount raised during the previous high achieved in 2007-08. The largest IPO was from General Insurance Corporation, which mobilised Rs 11,257 crore. The average deal size was a high Rs 1,825 crore. Of the total amount of Rs 1,77,116 crore, the amount raised through fresh capital was only Rs 91,205 crore (51%), the remaining Rs 85,911 crore being offers for sale (OFS).
 
 The overall response from the public to mainboard IPOs, according to PRIME Database, which compiles data on the primary capital market, was also very good. While 17 IPOs received a mega response of more than 10 times (Salasar Techno Engineering at 270 times, followed by Astron Paper & Board Mill at 241, Apollo Micro Systems at 176, Capacit’e Infraprojects at 130, CDSL at 119 and Amber Enterprises at 115), eight other IPOs were oversubscribed by more than three times. The balance 14 IPOs were oversubscribed 1-3 times.
 
 “The response to IPOs was further buoyed by strong listing performance,” said Pranav Haldea, MD, PRIME Database. Of the 38 IPOs that got listed, 17 gave a return of over 10% based on the closing price on listing date. Salasar Techno Engineering gave a 152% return followed by Astron Paper & Board (139%) and CDSL (76%).
 
 A notable feature of the year was that several companies that hit the market had a prior private equity/venture capital (PE/VC) investment. This was true for 17 out of the 45 IPOs. 
 
 OFS by such PE/VC investors at Rs 10,831 crore accounted for 13% of the total IPO amount. OFS by promoters at Rs 52,340 crore accounted for a further 64% of the IPO amount, data compiled by PRIME showed.
 
 Out of the 45 IPOs, 34 companies had anchor investors, which collectively subscribed to 19% of the total public issue amount. Domestic institutional investors played a significant role as anchor investors, with their subscription amounting to 9%, compared to 10% from FPIs.
 
 IPOs saw good response from retail investors. The highest number of applications was received by Cochin Shipyard at 19.4 lakhs followed by HUDCO (18.7 lakhs), CDSL (17.3 lakhs), Reliance Nippon Life AMC (15.6 lakhs) and Godrej Agrovet (14.5 lakhs).
 
 The year, again, witnessed significant activity in the SME platform. There were as many as 155 SME IPOs, again the highest ever, which collected a total of 2,247 crore. The current fiscal (2017-18) was the best year ever for divestments with 98,965 crore being raised by the government through share sales.
 
 According to Haldea, it is after 14 years, that the original divestment target of 72,500 crore has been achieved. While in previous years, divestment targets were always revised downwards, in 2017-18, the target was revised upwards for the first time from 72,500 crore to 1 lakh crore, which too is likely to be achieved, he said.
