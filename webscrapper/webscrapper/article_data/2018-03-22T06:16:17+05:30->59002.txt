Bur before that, SAD-BJP forced adjournment of the assembly over the demand for waiving loans of farmers and farm labourers. 

 The issue of sacrilege cases and political vendetta figured prominently in the House as   MLAs joined by AAP cornered   over the issues of drugs and lawlessness and cases of sacrilege reported during their rule. When the session resumed after SAD leaders trooped to the well of the House, its leaders, including party president   and  , were not present to take on the Congress and AAP.
 
 
  
 
 Dera Baba Nanak MLA Sukhjinder Randhawa lashed out at the Akalis for their misdeeds and said the incidents of religious sacrilege had deeply hurt the feelings of Punjabis all over the world. Randhawa accused the Akalis of engineering the sacrilege incidents just to divert attention from their growing failures at that time. Leader of Opposition   appreciated the decision of the Congress government to investigate various allegations against the erstwhile SAD-BJP government by appointing a commission. He said that it should be made a permanent feature so that any case of political vendetta during the present Congress government too could be looked into.
 
 Legislators of SAD and BJP came to the assembly wearing black robes with placards to protest against the Congress government's failure to fulfil its promise of a complete waiver. They demanded Rs 90,000 crore loan waiver for all farmers, including loans from nationalised and cooperative banks as well as private money lenders. Led by SAD president Sukhbir and Majithia, the SAD-BJP members trooped to the well of the House and shouted slogans against the state government. The House was adjourned for 30 minutes.
