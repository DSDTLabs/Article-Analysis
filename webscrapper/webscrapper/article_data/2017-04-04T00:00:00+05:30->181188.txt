When he saw the Marathi film  , filmmaker   was impressed with the content of the “pure” love story. Which is why he decided to remake it in   into   — made as a partnership between Rockline Production and  .

 “We are able to give several messages to young lovers, the parents and the system as well with this movie. And that really appealed to me. Today, the youth are capable of doing whatever they want. While falling in love and getting married are good things, young people should think about the consequences as well, such as how their parents will react and the other problems that they will have to face. They have to plan for that parallelly, and do it in such a way that it doesn’t affect their future or hurt their parents. This film will help people realize that,” says Venkatesh.
 
 While this has been a successful association between the production houses, Venkatesh says that future partnerships will depend on the script and content of the project. For the time being, they are concentrating on remaking the film in three other languages.
