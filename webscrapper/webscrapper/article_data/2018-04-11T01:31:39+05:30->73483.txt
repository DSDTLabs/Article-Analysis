GURUGRAM: The   (NHAI) has missed yet another deadline to complete construction of the   at  , which was scheduled to be opened to traffic on April 10. Almost 15% of the   roof at the underpass is yet to be laid. The new date for inauguration has not been finalised.

 According to officials, the dust storm which hit the city on April 6 damaged the canopy sheets meant for the underpass roof.  , project manager of contractor Valecha Eng Limited that is carrying out the work, said, “Last Friday’s storm severely damaged 85 sheets that were to be used as roof of the underpass.” He added all other work for the underpass is complete, from painting to fixing LED lights. 
 
 “Once the canopy roofs are placed, we’ll request a safety audit. The underpass will be opened once NHAI clears it. It will take us two days to complete the roof and hand over the underpass to NHAI once new canopy sheets arrive,” he added.
 
 The company which supplies canopy sheets said they had already completed their order by March 31. Ram Sharma, managing director of Coxwell, said, “My company had earlier sent the sheets by March 31.” But with 85 of these sheets rendered unusable after the storm, fresh ones are needed. TOI has learnt the supply can arrive earliest by Thursday. Ravinder Singh Yadav, team leader of   (ITL) and NHAI engineering consultant for the project, said, “The delay is because raw material for the canopy sheets is imported.”
 
 The Hero Honda Chowk underpass was conceptualised in 2007, but got delayed due to land acquisition litigations. “It’s not easy for us to give a date for completion of the underpass until the canopy sheets arrive,” added Yadav. Work was expedited after Gurujam on 2016.
