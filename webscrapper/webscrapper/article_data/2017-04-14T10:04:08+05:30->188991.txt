GUWAHATI: Stepping up the demand for a separate state of Bodoland, the All Bodo Students' Union (Absu) and other Bodo organizations observed 'Betrayal Day' on Thursday and threatened to launch a week-long economic blockade in the state if the Centre does not pay heed to their demand. 

 Absu president   said they have been "betrayed" time and again by the government at the Centre and Betrayal Day marks the  's "false promise". "The Centre has not paid heed to our demands and requests over the years. So, we are now forced to announce a week-long economic blockade from May 20. Before that, we have called for a 24-hour bandh on April 25," he added. The Peoples' Joint Action Committee for Bodoland Movement and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Progressive) have also joined hands in their demand for a separate Bodoland. 
 
 Other demands made by the Bodo organizations include assurance of political rights for Bodos living outside the proposed Bodoland and ST (Hills) status for Bodo people living in the Karbi Anglong and   districts.
 
 During the election, Boro said,   had promised both in its written manifesto and verbally that it would resolve the Bodo problem immediately if it came to power in New Delhi. "The Bodo leadership supported BJP in the parliamentary election. Five out of the seven seats that BJP won in Assam could be won solely due to support from the Bodo organizations. However, there has been no initiative to see the promise through," he added. 
 
 "The Bodo people have been seeking the creation of Bodoland state for the last 50 years to protect and preserve the ethnic identity, traditional customs and land rights of the indigenous people living on the northern banks of the Brahmaputra as well as the Bodo people living outside the proposed Bodoland," Boro said.
