Rajkot: The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) is also planning to clean up river Aji passing through the city and the 19 water drainages so that there is no waterlogging in the city. 

 The entire 10 km stretch of Aji will be divided into 12 blocks for clean-up and removal of garbage and plastic. 
 
 RMC will also clear all the encroachment such as handcarts and temporary constructions that obstruct the natural flow of water from the 19 drains into the river. 
 
 Cleaning up water drains is a process carried every year, but major areas like Raiya crossroads, Madhapar crossroads, Mahila College underbridge, Astron crossroads and Lakshminagar underbridge witness severe waterlogging every monsoon.
