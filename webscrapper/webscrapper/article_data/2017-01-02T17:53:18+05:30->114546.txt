MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday ordered the   district   to conduct an inquiry and take necessary action against Vetrivel Explosives Private Ltd in T Murungapatty village where nineteen people died in a blast on December 1.

 The order came after K Periyasamy of Thuraiyur taluk and two others filed a public interest litigation in the court seeking cancellation of the licence of Vetrivel Explosives. 
 
 When the PIL came up for hearing before a division bench headed by Justice A Selvam, the petitioner’s side said the explosives   had violated rules. The company manufactured electric, non-electric and plain detonators and other products which involved the use of chemicals. However, it did not treat the waste generated from the factory which are hazardous and harmful. 
 
 The waste is allowed to flow to a riverbed and unused borewells, situated near the factory. The ground water had been contaminated due to this. The villagers were suffering from various skin and other diseases, the petitioner’s side said.
 
 When the water samples were taken from the borewells and were tested in a government recognised lab, it came to know that the quantum of dissolved solids was higher than the permissible limit of 2000mg per litre. There was 7,240 mg per litre, the petitioner’s side said.
 
 The PIL said the issue had been taken to the notice of the Chief Controller of Explosives, Nagpur. When an inquiry was conducted in June last, it appeared that there were many violations.
 
 The factory’s licence was suspended after the after December 1 explosion, the petitioner’s side said, adding that it was as necessary to study the issue and cancel the company’s licence permanently.
 
 Following this, the court ordered the Trichy district collector to conduct an inquiry and pass orders in two months.
