 The cops slated for transfer are those who have been working in one police station for years together without being transferred. The   R$N Dhoke had sought a detailed report from deputy commissioner of police   in the matter. According to Dhoke, it was discovered that such cops developed a nexus and did not perform their duty efficiently .
 
 Dhoke said, â€œ A detailed report of the past five to ten years was sought from the DCP about the number of years all cops -including SIs, ASIs, and head constables -were posted in their current posting. In the report, we found that more than 80 cops were posted in same area for the past three to four years. Now, what is wrong with this is that these cops created their nexus and did not take any action against illegal activities in their jurisdiction.
