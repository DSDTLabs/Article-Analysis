HYDERABAD : The   on Tuesday sought to know from the State of   and authorities concerned their stand on a petition filed by two research scholars from  . The petition alleged that the   (ISCA) was misled with wrong facts and scared away from conducting the prestigious meet in Hyderabad.

 The bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice G Shyam Prasad also sought to know whether the association is a government body or a private one. It made it clear that it will not direct organisers about where the venue of the meet must be. However, it assured the petitioners that it will ascertain facts with regard to the allegation that authorities deliberately created a scare that the venue at Hyderabad in Osmania University was unsafe for conducting the meet.
  
  
 The petitioners charged the police with painting a picture of OU as being a terror hub and with doing injustice to the univeristy and Hyderabad in the process. The Bench posted the case to January 23 and directed authorities to respond to the allegation by that time.
 
 “Is ISCA an instrumentality of the Sate as described in Article 12 of the Constitution?” the bench asked.
 
 The petitioners’ counsel G L Narasimha Rao told the court that the decision of the Telangana authorities resulted in huge loss to the State, OU and to local researchers. Science   resolutions become a part of the Centre’s scientific efforts and losing such an opportunity is unwise, the petitioners said.
 
 Shifting the venue to Manipur from Hyderabad is unfortunate, they said, urging the court to direct authorities to bring the meet back to OU. The bench said it cannot give such directions and posted the case to January 23.
