INDORE: With the arrest of a domestic help, the city police on Sunday solved a series of thefts reported from a house over the last few years and recovered stolen goods worth Rs 15 lakh from the accused.

 Anshal Agrawal, a resident of South Tukoganj who owns a candle making factory, had employed Geetabai Mande of Pancham Ki Fel area as a domestic help at his house. 
 
 The complainant said the woman had been offering her services at the house for fifteen years and the family had trusted her.
 
 It was only after Anshul raised an alarm about someone stealing Rs 48,500 he had kept in an almirah that the family members informed him about Rs 3.5 lakh and other valuables, including diamond-studded and gold jewellery, going missing from the house over the last few years.
 
 Tukoganj police registered a case under section 380 of   on Saturday and interrogated Geetabai on suspicion of her involvement in the theft.
 
 Initially, the woman feigned ignorance about the whole incident, but when she was forced, Geetabai confessed to stealing cash and other valuables worth lakhs of rupees from her employer’s house on different occasions.
 
 The police then conducted a search at her house and recovered Rs 48,500 in cash, jewellery and other valuables worth Rs 15 lakh.
 
 A case was registered against the woman and further investigation was on.
 
 Referring to the incident,   (Kotwali) Prabha Chouhan stressed on the importance of completing police verifications before employing domestic help or giving out a particular property on rent.
 
 “Despite our advice to provide information about domestic help/tenants, people avoid it. In many cases, we find that a domestic help or tenant is usually involved in such crimes. One should approach the local police station with the domestic help/tenants’ identity and address proof for police verification,” she told TOI.
