HYDERABAD: To reduce the ever-increasing load on Gandhi and   in  , the Telangana government has started strengthening   so that they can cater to the medical needs of patients from rural areas.

 The state government has given nod to the commissioner of health and family welfare to hire specialist doctors such as obstetricians, gynaecologists, paediatricians, anaesthetists, cardiologists, urologists, nephrologists, staff nurses and lab technicians for such hospitals. These doctors would be paid anywhere between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh per month or on a case to case basis. District collectors have been empowered to fix the payment for specialist doctors. Depending upon the flow of patients and availabili ty of specialists, the timings of the doctors would be fixed.
 
 “Already , in a few districts, specialist doctors have agreed to visit hospitals daily . In some others, it could be twice or thrice in a week,“ said commissioner of health and family welfa re Karuna Vakati.
 
 Speaking to TOI, she said that the idea is to reduce the pressure on Gandhi, Osmania, Niloufer and other government hospitals in Greater Hyderabad. “ Although patients who require major treatments will continue to come to Hyderabad, we hope up-gradation of district hospitals will help in significantly reducing this number,“ she added.
