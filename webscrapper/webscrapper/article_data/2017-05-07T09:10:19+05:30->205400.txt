BHOPAL: A tiger was found dead under mysterious circumstances in   (STR) of   on Saturday. With this, the tiger toll in MP in the last 14 months has gone up to 42. Since January 2017 state has lost 12 tigers.

 Forest department sources said the tiger, 4 years in age, died of poisoning or electrocution. An autopsy would be conducted on the carcass, said a senior forest officer.
 
 Meanwhile, sources in the forest department have blamed the incident on the negligence of STR officials. 
 
 Earlier, a tiger was run over by a train between Budhni and Midghat area in Sehore district. Another tiger and a leopard were found dead under mysterious circumstances at the same spot on February 23. Sources said that a wrong chain-fencing around the Midghat railway track might be causing frequent deaths at this spot.
 
 Conservation expert   says tiger populations can have mortality rates as high as 20% annually (as per some studies). 
 
 "This means lot of tigers die every year but the population is replenished by newborns. This also means, with higher population, more tigers will die naturally," he said. 
 
 But in Madhya Pradesh, other than natural reasons, lot of tigers died of electrocution in 2016. Almost all the electrocution occurred due to the illegal electric fences that famers had put to protect their crops. In some cases, tigers were poisoned through water holes. Four tigers died in accidents on railway tracks and roads in 2016. 
 
 Poaching is a serious threat. However, in past few years there seems to a decline in poaching involving tigers directly. 
 
 In majority of accidental   in MP during 2016, the perpetrators did extract the body parts like claws, canines and hide. This was largely done for occult practices.
