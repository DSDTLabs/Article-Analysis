MUMBAI: The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education has cancelled the   of Mount Mary School,  , and recommended to the state education department to derecognise it for involvement of school staff in   paper leaks earlier this year.

 On March 11, Vashi police arrested the trustee, head clerk and headmaster of the school along with two others for circulating question papers before students started writing the exam. Five question papers were circulated on WhatsApp before the exam.
 
 “Police submitted their report and the staff were found to have done wrong. We wanted to set an example to deter others from indulging in such activities. We sent the school a show-cause notice and passed an order to cancel its board registration number. The school has 14 days to appeal against the order,” said Dattatray Jagtap, chairperson of the board’s Mumbai division. He added that the police report names 10 students who indulged in malpractices. “Results of these students have been announced but we will hold back their passing certificates and conduct an inquiry before initiating action,” said Jagtap.
 
 The board has also written to the school education department recommending that the school’s junior college section – classes XI and XII – be  . “The final call will be of the education department. But since our registration is cancelled we have written to the government to accommodate the current students in nearby institutes,” said Jagtap. There are approximately 100 students studying at the junior college.
 
 Deputy director of education B B Chavan said they had received a request from the board. “We will evaluate the case and ensure students are not at loss. They will be accommodated in schools around them. We have done that in previous cases too,” he said. 
 
 School authorities were unavailable for comment.
 
 Police were led to the school officials’ involvement due to the backward integration of WhatsApp messages, the WhatsApp image of the leaked question paper of Secretarial Practice, which had the code ‘T-70’ meant for Palghar district, and a pair of scissors with a unique design, again captured in the WhatsApp image of the question paper as it was used as a paper weight while clicking a photo of the paper.
