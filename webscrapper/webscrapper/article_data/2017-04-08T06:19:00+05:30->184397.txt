Kolkata: Three Bengalis from India will be among the seven persons to be honoured for their role in Bangladesh’s 1971 War of Independence by Sheikh   in New Delhi on Saturday. 

 While the brave feats of the four others — lance naik Albert Ekka (Param Vir Chakra), Maj Anup Singh Gahlaut (Maha Vir Chakra), subedar Malkiat Singh (Maha Vir Chakra) and sepoy Anusuya Prasad (Maha Vir Ch-akra) are well-known, not many are aware of the contributions of Lt Samir Das, squadron leader A B Samanta and lance naik Mohini Ranjan Chakraborty.
 
 “Lt Samir Das was in the first batch that undertook the Navy’s Clearance Diving Officers course in 1969. He was then sent to the UK for the Long Mine Clearance Diving Officers course. It was Lt Das who suggested the use of ‘limpet’ mines to the Navy. These mines came in very useful during the War of Liberation. Lt Das was killed in a road accident on September 26, 1971,” an officer said.
 
 Samanta was a Hunter pilot and was shot down over Tejgaon on December 4, 1971. “As he was killed, nothing is known of what he achieved during the sortie before being shot down. Lesser still is known of lance naik Mohini Ranjan Chakraborty of the Border Security Force, who was martyred during the war,” the officer added.
