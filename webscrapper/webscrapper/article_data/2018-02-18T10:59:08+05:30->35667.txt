WASHINGTON DC: United States President   has attacked the news media over the coverage of special counsel  's indictment of 13 Russians accused of meddling in the 2016 election.

 In a series of tweets on Saturday, President Trump said media didn't report how the Russian groups were active long before his announcement to run for the post of the US President.
 
 "Funny how the Fake News Media doesn't want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn't know!" President Trump tweeted.
 
 "The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the vice-president of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman!" he said in a second tweet.
 
 President Trump also highlighted a   column that called the indictment "a big win" for Trump and deputy attorney general  's statement that it did not include allegations that "any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity."
 
 On Friday, President Trump announced that the indictments in  's investigation show his campaign "did nothing wrong" and prove there was "no collusion" with Russia.
