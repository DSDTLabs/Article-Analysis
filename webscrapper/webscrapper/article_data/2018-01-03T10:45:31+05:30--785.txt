KOCHI: A teenager who tried to play a   on his friend ended up in police station on Tuesday as the entire script of his act went awry. 

 He was apprehended by residents in the friend's neighbourhood around 11.30am at   in   panchayat.
 
 Police said the boy and another person, who acted as his accomplice, had 'promised to arrange a girl' for their common friend. In order to do this, the boy sneaked out wearing his aunt's purdah and went to his friend's house to pull his leg. After alighting from the bike, he was walking alone to the doorstep when an elderly woman accosted him.
 
 Things took another turn as the elderly woman got suspicious and asked him his name. He was caught red handed as his voice gave him away. "As he had tonsured his head, a part of it was visible after the purdah had slipped. The elderly woman asked his name and his voice betrayed his gender. Hearing his voice, the woman called up residents and they detained him and informed us. We took him to the station. The boy is not that intelligent and we called his uncle. Later, we released him after giving a strict warning to his caretakers that they should keep an eye one him and that he shall not indulge in such pranks again," said  .
 
 But things did not end there as residents who detained him fabricated fake news by claiming that he was the member of a gang involved in kidnapping children. The fake news, along with a video and his photo went viral on WhatsApp.
 
 "I also received this fake news. It is very sad that people in the area turned reporters without verifying the veracity of the incident and background of the boy," said  , state coordinator of Child Protective Unit, an NGO.
