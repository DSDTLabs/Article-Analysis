RAJKOT: In run up to achieving smart city status, the   ( ) will be installing 45 new smart traffic signals with pedestrian crossing facility to ease the traffic chaos on city roads. The entire traffic signalling system will be connected with Eye-Way project.

 The traffic signals will be monitored and controlled from the Nana Mauva multi-activity centre jointly operated by RMC and city police commissioner’s office. The smart signalling system will work on the basis of traffic movement in different areas. RMC will be conducting a survey to check number of vehicles passing through a crossing everyday. RMC commissioner   said, “We plan to float the tender by the end of April and by May 15 this smart signalling system is expected to be functional.”
 
 As many as 100 new constables, who had joined the police force, have been deputed at traffic junctions. 
 
 “This signalling system will ease traffic on the road as one vehicle passing through a signal will not get red signal ahead,” said Rajkot traffic DCP J K Zala. As the signals will be integrated with Eye-Way project, traffic signal violators will be fined through e-memo, he added.
 
 Currently there are 11 traffic signals junctions in Rajkot city, but most of them are out of order and cops manage traffic manually. 
 
 Citizens feel that just by installing signals at junctions won’t ease the traffic problem.   activist Shailendrasinh Jadeja said, “The new signals will work for few days and then will be out of order. The civic body and traffic police need to tackle this issue in a smart way.”
 
 Currently Rajkot RTO has 20 lakh registered vehicles of which 1 lakh new vehicles are registered in the last one year. This include 75,000 two-wheelers and 25,000 four-wheelers. Out of 20 lakh registered vehicles nearly 14-15 lakh vehicles ply in Rajkot city itself.
