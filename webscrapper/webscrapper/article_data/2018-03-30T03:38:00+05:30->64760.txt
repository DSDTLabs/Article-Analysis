Panaji: The state government has sent a draft to noted lawyer Harish Salve to seek his opinion on mining issues including whether to file a review petition or to seek any other options. Cabinet advisory committee (CAC) member Vijai Sardesai said that Salve has agreed to give his opinion to the state government free-of-cost. In February, the Supreme Court quashed the renewal of 88 mining leases and stopped mining operations from March 16. CAC, on Thursday, discussed the points in the draft sent to Salve. “The draft has been sent to Salve for his opinion and then his opinion will be forwarded to the attorney general of India to decide on the course of action,” urban development minister Francis D’ Souza said. The draft, approved by the CAC, includes history of Goa’s mining industry, various court decisions and petitions filed in court with regards to mining, various options including filing of review petitions, details how economic activities will be affected, what can be done till iron ore mines are auctioned in the state, etc. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, CAC member and town and country planning minister Sardesai said, “We discussed points which we are putting up for legal advice to explore the possibility if the state can file a review petition in the Apex court.”
