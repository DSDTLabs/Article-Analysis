CHENNAI: More than 88% of cases pending before the   are civil cases, and this highlights the urgent need for the judiciary to create additional benches and divert much of its strength to clearing   that have piled up due to slow disposals and complex procedures.

 Of the 2,97,615 cases waiting to be disposed of as on December 31, 2016, a total of 2,62,585 are civil cases, constituting 88.23% of the total pending dockets. In contrast, criminal cases numbered only 35,030. The figures also reflect the dwindling tribe of lawyers practising on the civil side, and the shrinking pie for the big criminal Bar.
 
 While disposal of civil cases stood at 82%, in the case of criminal cases it was a whopping 98.8% That is, 60,471 new criminal cases were filed in 2016, and the court disposed of 59,767 cases. It has left only 35,030 criminal cases pending before both the principal bench of the court in Chennai and the Madurai bench together.
 
 In contrast, though 97,772 civil cases were filed before both benches of the court together, only 85,239 were disposed of. By 2016-end, a total of 2,62,585 civil cases were pending.
 
 Since the court’s pending civil cases are about seven times more than the criminal cases, the need to focus on civil case disposals is being felt stronger than ever. “Relatively low disposal of civil side cases has brought down the overall percentage of the court. Now that the court has more judges, with many more scheduled to join the bench soon, the high court administration must create extra benches for civil cases,” a senior lawyer told TOI.
 
 The bigger picture is, pendency of cases in the high court has crawled upward, and neared the 3 lakh mark by 2016-end, perhaps because the court had to function with about 50% unfilled judge vacancies for most part of the year. Other reasons for the rising numbers could be the slow disposal of civil cases as compared to criminal cases that stood at more than 98%, and Bar disruption to court works.
 
 The calendar year of 2016 began with an opening balance of 2,84,428 cases, and ended with with a pendency of 2,97,615 cases, an addition of more than 13,000 dockets. In overall percentage terms, 91% was disposed of, resulting in an increase of about 9% of cases when the court entered the new calendar year 2017.
 
 Though the court, as on date, has 57 judges as against the sanctioned strength of 75 judges, a record total of 24 new judges were sworn in between April and November 2016. In addition to unfilled vacancies, the court had to sail through Bar disturbances arising out of penal action initiated by the   (BCI) and its state unit against sections of lawyers for misconduct.
