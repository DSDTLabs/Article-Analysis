MEERUT: As   hovered close to 5 degree Celsius in   and adjoining regions, lakhs of students of   braved the morning chill to reach schools, even as the administration’s struggle to provide them with sweaters continued.
 
  Only 52% of the total 1.19 lakh students have got sweaters in Meerut district so far.
  
  “The sweaters have been distributed among 61,942 students in Meerut district, which accounts for 52% of the total 1,19,120 students in the government schools here. The process of sweater distribution is on and will complete before the deadline of February 3 set up by the state government authorities,” said  , basic shiksha adhikari ( ) of Meerut.
  
  After tenders floated by the state government to procure sweaters for 1.54 crore primary school students across state got lukewarm response, it passed the buck to its teachers, providing them just Rs 100 per sweaters. The rest Rs 100 per sweater will be released after what the UP government said “quality test” of the garments.
  
  However, teachers are now saying that the maroon-coloured sweaters are going out of stock in market.
  
  “We are getting complaints that it is getting difficult to procure such a huge number of sweaters from the market, because the maroon-colour sweater – which is prescribed in the uniform – is decreasing as a huge stock has been purchased from the market,” said a source in the education department.
