CHENNAI: Three metro stations are almost ready to help link various neighbourhoods in the north of the city with the underground transit hub at Central Metro.

 They now only await key systems to operate trains on the 5km of tracks connecting them to the metro station, which is just 600m from Chennai Central Railway Station. The stations will become part of the transit system by the end of the year — when   opens the line to the north together with line under Anna Salai between Central Metro and AGDMS.
 
 CMRL has laid the tracks to the three underground stations —  , Mannadi and high court, an official said. “We are now installing critical electrical and electronic systems to operate trains on the line ,” he said. “Work is underway on overhead equipment and signalling systems.”
 
 Commuters can expect full-fledged services by the new year. But CMRL will not open the stations unless four underground stations connecting May Day Park, Government Estate, LIC and Thousand Lights are ready.
 
 “Since the Washermenpet-Central Metro stretch and the Anna Salai line are part of the same corridor, we will not be able to operate trains unless all systems are installed as far as AG-DMS,” the official said.
 
 Once the underground line along Anna Salai is ready, it will connect Washermenpet with the airport via Anna Salai and GST Road. Commuters will also be able to get to the airport from Central on a direct train on the line under  .
 
 “Some of the features and systems in the upper track toward Poonamallee high road and the lower track toward Anna Salai are connected. We have to get both the track levels ready before we begin operations at Central,” the official said.
 
 Some of these stations on Anna Salai is being linked with the existing pedestrian subways for easy access for both pedestrians and commuters. Pedestrians will be able to use underground stations to cross the main junctions at Teynampet and Nandanam through a non-paid area.
