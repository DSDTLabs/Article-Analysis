PATNA: Former Union minister and BJP national spokesman   on Saturday rubbished speculation that JD (U) may join hands with NDA again. “As far as alliance with JD (U) is concerned, there is neither any discussion on it in BJP nor do I have any information in this regard,” Hussain said.

 Earlier in the day, while inaugurating Patna Book Fair at   here, Nitish had put colour in the design of lotus (BJP’s party symbol) sketched by Madhubani painter Bahua Devi, who had recently been conferred with the   award by the Union government. “He (Nitish) put colour in the lotus design and had also supported note ban. Likewise, we had supported total prohibition in the state. PM   believes in ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas.’ But there is no discussion about JD (U) joining hands with the NDA,” Shahnawaz said.
 
 He said there was no question of loss or gain for BJP due to refusal of Nitish to campaign for any party in Uttar Pradesh. Stating that the BJP did not need the support of any party, Shahnawaz said neither Nitish nor RJD president Lalu Prasad had any stake in the UP assembly elections. “Going by the trend, the BJP would win 300 seats in UP,” Shahnawaz said. He, however, added the assembly elections in UP should not be considered a referendum on note ban, as demonetisation and fight against black money was the ‘national work’ of the BJP-led government at the Centre.
