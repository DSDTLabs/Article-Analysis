 NHAI officials said though the contract for building underpass, flyover and widening of stretches between the   station and Parade Road crossing was awarded three months back, the work has not yet started as they need to get the approval. “Certain number trees have to be cut. Since this area falls under the ridge, it’s mandatory to take the permission from the SC panel,” an NHAI official said.
 
 The work was scheduled to start in October.
 
 Officials added that early completion of the project will have positive impact on the ambient air and environment since currently this stretch experiences gridlock like situation throughout the day. The defence ministry has already given permission for carrying out construction in land falling under its jurisdiction.
