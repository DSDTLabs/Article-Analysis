Director   has been known to rope in big stars for his movies, and for his latest venture – the Tamil remake of   – the filmmaker has now cast   in the role of the antagonist. The remake has Arvind Swami and   playing the lead roles essayed by Mammootty and Nayanthara respectively in the Malayalam film.
 
 Siddique tells us, “Aftab plays Amala’s husband and is the antagonist in the film. We wanted someone who would match Arvind Swami’s stature and also had the looks of a hero. After a long search, we finally zeroed in on Aftab for the role.”
  
 The movie would also mark the Bollywood actor’s debut in the South film industry. His role was played by Telugu actor JD Chakravarthy in the Malayalam film. Ask Siddique if the characters are tweaked for the remake and he says, “All the characters are essentially the same, we haven’t tinkered much with them. However, we have substantially changed the second half of the plot for the Tamil audience.”
  
 The movie, which will start its second schedule on May 9 in Kochi, will also have Nasser and Malayalam actor Siddique in pivotal roles. Incidentally, the filmmaker will also start work on its Hindi remake, which has Sanjay Dutt in the lead, later this year.
  
 “Right now, the Tamil film is set for an August release and the plan is to begin shooting the Bollywood movie by September. I attended a few meetings earlier this year; I am now waiting to complete the current project so that we can finalise the rest of the cast and crew for the Hindi movie,” concludes Siddique, who had earlier remade the Dileep-starrer Bodyguard in Tamil and Hindi with Vijay and Salman Khan, respectively.
