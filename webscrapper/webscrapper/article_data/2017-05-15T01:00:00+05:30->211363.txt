Irrfan, one of India’s most respected actors, is known to handpick his roles carefully, whether it’s in Hollywood or Bollywood. His upcoming slice-of-life comedy, 'Hindi Medium', questions the belief of those parents in our country who go to any length to get their child admitted to an English medium school. 

 Going to an English medium school is perceived to be like a certificate that indicates one belongs to the elite bracket of society. Several parents in India consider their child’s schooling as a status symbol within their social circle. As a parent himself,   understood the English-versus-Hindi medium divide and the societal pressures to secure an admission in the best school. Hindi Medium doles out a strong message, and director   has used humour — one of Irrfan’s strongest assets — to drive the point home.
 
 'Hindi Medium', produced by   Vijan and  , and presented by T-series and   Films, releases on May 19.
