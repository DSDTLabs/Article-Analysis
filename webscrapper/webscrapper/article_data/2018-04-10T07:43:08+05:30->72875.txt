PANAJI: A Class XI student must be eligible to   supplementary exams without adding sports and condonation marks, the   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has told schools in the revised assessement pattern for Class XI issued recently. 

 As per Goa Board norms, in Classes IX and XI, only students that fail in one or two subjects are eligible to answer the supplementary exams. 
 
 “Condonation marks and sports merit marks should not be considered to make student eligible to appear for supplementary examination,” the new circular states. 
 
 The supplementary exams are held in June each year, so that students who clear the   can be promoted to the next class without wasting a year.
 
 “A student declared ‘Needs Improvement’ and securing an overall ‘H’ or ‘I’ grade in one or two subjects will be eligible to appear for supplementary examination in one/two subjects only,” the board’s circular reads. This is unlike the situation in Classes X and XII, in which, from June 2017, students have been allowed to improve their score in any number of subjects in which they fail. 
 
 Earlier, the Class XI supplementary examination was of 80 marks and of a duration of two-and-a-half hours for non-practical subjects and 55 marks for the same duration for practical subjects.
