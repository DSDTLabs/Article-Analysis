Panaji: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has completed the inspection of 88 mining leases to check pre-monsoon preparedness. A report will be prepared based on the inspection and necessary directions issued to mining companies.  “Mining companies have to take safety precautions based on the directions to prevent any untoward incident due to collection of water in open pits,” said a GSPCB senior official.  The inspection of mines commenced on Monday and ended on Thursday. A senior GSPCB officer said that the board has requested mining companies to take safety measures as the leases do not belong to them. He said that the directorate of mines safety has already inspected the mines to see that companies have taken all measures to avoid any incident during the monsoon. He added that officials from the Indian Bureau of Mines are likely to conduct an inspection soon. The directorate general of mines safety (DGMS) had asked leaseholders to take appropriate safety measures before closing operations. The instructions were given in light of the Supreme Court order that mining operations in Goa should shut down by March 15. On February 7, the court quashed 88 leases granted by the state government in 2015and also directed that mining operations shut down by March 15. The directorate of mines and geology said that all mine owners, agents, and managers against whom the verdict is applicable are requested to take suitable safety measures as required under the Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961, and all other applicable statues as per the provisions of the Mines Act, 1952.
