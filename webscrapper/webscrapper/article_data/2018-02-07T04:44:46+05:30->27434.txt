MUMBAI: A   (CR) ticket-checker has been   after it was found that he had misappropriated Rs 43 lakh he had collected as fines from unauthorised travellers. B R Vaidya had been siphoning cash for several years,   officials said.

 CR divisional railway manager S K Jain said, “Vaidya has been suspended and a major penalty chargesheet was issued to him on December 15, 2017.”
 
 Source said that if found guilty he can be dismissed from service. Chief ticket inspector D S Pawar , S N Patil and head ticket examiner V S Kitake have also been issued major penalty chargesheets for slack supervision.
 
 Source said Vaidya was not the only one; there are many more who do not deposit the fine amount collected from ticketless commuters.
 
 Right to Information activist Samir Zaveri said, “The railways is trying to shield Vaidya. The authorities should have filed a first information report (FIR) as this is case of cheating and he liable to be punished under Prevention of Corruption Act too.”
 
 Another source said that till now, accounts up to 2012 are being checked; the amount is likely to increase as investigations are on for period till date.
 
 Another official said, “The railway system is archaic and the authorities must make use of technology so that the fine amount get reflected in the system as soon as a receipt is generated via a machine.   (CRIS) needs to work on the technology as use of paper receipts is prone to manipulation. Also, it is not possible to verify each and every paper receipt that has been submitted by a TTE for record and audit purposes.”
