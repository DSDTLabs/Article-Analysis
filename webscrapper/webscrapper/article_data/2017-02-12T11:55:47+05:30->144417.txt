JAIPUR: The menace of   continues to take toll on city roads.

 “The trolleys are attached at the back of the cabin room of the truck. They don’t have   installed on them. Therefore, it is very difficult to spot them in nights and   mornings,” added a traffic police official. 
 
 There have been numerous incidents where cars and bikes rammed into trolleys after failing to spot them. “The drivers of these trucks and tractors have been repeatedly told to put glow in the dark tapes and some lights, but they flout these rules and cause havoc on city streets,” the official added.
 
 The trolley also known as trailer is attached to the vehicle with an iron tool. “If the trailer is overloaded with weight, then driver cannot see any vehicles coming from behind. It is almost impossible in such cases to take a turn without hitting any vehicle,” the official said.
 
 The menace of these trailers is especially dreadful on highways and bypass where they are driven in high speed. “As per rules, the drivers should install rear glasses, and not pack their trailers beyond capacity. But once they leave the city limits, they start flouting norms,” the official said.
 
 In December last years, two people had died when their car rammed into the trailer near Shivdaspura on early morning hours. “The car driver couldn’t spot the trailer as there were no radium tapes nor any light. The car rammed into the trailer and the two people died whereas the driver of the tractor fled from the area,” the official said.
 
 The police said that they have started issuing challans to such erring drivers and yet they continue to flout the basic safety norms. “The drivers don’t want to spend even a single penny on road safety, this is the reason why we have so many accidents in the city,” added official.
