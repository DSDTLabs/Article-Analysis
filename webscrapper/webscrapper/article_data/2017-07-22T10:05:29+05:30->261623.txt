JODHPUR: Turning back to the basics of survival in deserts,   (BSF) is going to push hundreds of  ,  .

 The BSF has switched to this traditional solution for its companies in   after the   and other vehicles, all a part of modern logistics support for desert functioning, failed in simmering and arid weather conditions here, coupled with the atypical problem posed by shifting sand dunes.
 
 It is to be mentioned that the BSF had recently deployed two 'sand scooters' for smooth running on shifting sand dunes in course of vigil in Jaisalmer and Bikaner sectors along the international borders. But the intensely high day temperatures of above 50 degrees Celsius in The Great Indian Desert rendered both the sand scooters and other standard vehicles ineffective which get stuck after covering a distance of mere two-three kilometres on hot sand.
 
 IG BSF of Rajasthan Frontier, Anil Paliwal said that powered by a source abundant in number and tough enough, camel carts are the only logical solution to the typical hostile cli matic and terrain conditions here. Paliwal said that every company of BSF in these sectors shall put these cost effective camel carts to optimal use including that for mobile patrolling, transporting the manpower, carrying rations, cold water tanks and other logistic supplies.
 
 “Camel carts will be a fool proof, all weather solution for going deep into sandy dunes for kilometres while patrolling and providing requisite sustenance stuff to the troops at border pillars and posts on the vast terrain along the border here in Rajasthan desert,“ said Paliwal, adding that these camel cart are the only 'desert vehicles' that can go deep into the shifting sand dunes and ply easily on scorching sand which would otherwise jam any other vehicle.
