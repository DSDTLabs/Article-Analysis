GAYA: A joint team of the  ,   police and state environment and forest department destroyed poppy   spread over eight acres of government land in the   police station area of the district on Thursday.

 The illegal crop was believed to have been sown by Maoists for revenue generation purpose. Opium obtained from   in illegal markets.
 
 Police said the clandestine cultivation was done in virtually inaccessible areas of the Maoist-affected Barachatti police station area. No arrests could be made. For, identifying the croppers is difficult as the land is owned by the forests department, police said.
