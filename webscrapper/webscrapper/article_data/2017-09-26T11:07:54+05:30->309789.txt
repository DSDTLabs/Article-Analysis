 Eat clean and healthy and exercise regularly. Your body is a temple, start respecting it and you will lead a happy and healthy life.
  
 
 During my  , there were many times I wanted to leave everything. Especially in the middle of a workout. But the very reason for which I started this journey kept the fire burning in me. My mentor and my friend, Dev Kanojia, kept pushing me towards my goal.
  
 
 
 Think positive and never think that it canâ€™t be done. It takes time but it will eventually happen.
  
 
 
 The most difficult part of being overweight was my cardiac condition. I had high blood pressure and heart beat fluctuations.
  
 
 
 I reduced my body fat percentage from 36% to 9%. I plan to gain muscle now. I wish to have 10% body fat with lean muscle mass and this is my goal 10 years down the line.
 
 
 
 I have started eating healthy. I do not eat any junk food and cook food on my own.
  
 
 
 Losing weight requires a lot of effort and hard work. The struggle can get hard sometimes.
  
 
 My past does not equal my future. I also learnt that there are no shortcuts.
