Kolkata: This year’s state HS topper   wrote a complaint letter to Jadavpur University’s science faculty dean S Konar on Monday, as his name had been published on top of the admission   of the Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics departments, without even appearing in the entrance tests.

 Panigrahi wrote, “Someone fudged my details to fill in the undergraduate course forms of many science subjects, with an ill intention. I am informing you so that necessary steps can be taken.”
 
 When contacted, Konar however said he did not received any complaint. “Whenever the dean receives a complaint, it is placed before the   committee. Such problem cropped up as the committee did not check the authenticity of the candidates on the merit list, which used to be done earlier,” said a source.
 
 Candidates are required to fill in the online form and submit an application fee. The merit list shows that Panigrahi has filled in the form, but not paid the fee.
 
 A teacher, however, claimed that a physical verification of documents later would have solved the problem. “There is no reason to panic,” he said.
