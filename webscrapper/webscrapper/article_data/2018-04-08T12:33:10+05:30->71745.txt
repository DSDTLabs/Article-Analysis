HYDERABAD: Former Union minister S   dared chief minister   to respond to the Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) report pulling up the Telangana government for wrong accounting figures and claims in the 2016-17 budget. 

 "The government is facing a debt trap of Rs 2.2 lakh crore. CAG castigated the government for its irregular accounting procedures and poor maintenance of the state's finances. We are not against borrowings by the state but it should not exceed the fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM),"   said at a press conference here on Saturday.
 
 He said the FRBM system was introduced by the   government mainly to ensure fiscal responsibility and financial discipline in governments. "If the revenue deficit and borrowings cross a limit, it will cast a great impact on the future generations," he said. 
 
 Jaipal said the TRS government had borrowed money by giving wrong revenue projections by claiming that the state is revenue-surplus. The audit report said revenue surplus was overstated by Rs 6,778 crore on account of irregular accounting when in reality, the state faced a revenue deficit of Rs 5,392 crore. He said while MPs from neighbouring AP were protesting in   for implementation of provisions of AP Reorganization Act, the CM was maintaining close relations with the PM.
