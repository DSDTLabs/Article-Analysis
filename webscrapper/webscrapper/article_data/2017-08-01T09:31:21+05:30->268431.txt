PUNE: Blame the cold air entering the country from higher altitudes for subdued rainfall as well as break spells of   over India.

 A recent   ( ) study published in the Journal of Climate has linked subdued rainfall and break spells of monsoon in India to cold air invading the country from higher altitudes between the tropics and the Arctic polar regions.
 
 Researchers said cold air intrusion from these regions can cause changes in the  , hindering monsoon convection over the country.
 
 IITM’s Suvarna Fadnavis and  , the researchers involved in the study, said they used the monsoon break spell in June 2014 over India as an example to confirm their findings. They also extended the analysis to the monsoon break during 1979 and 2007. The study of the 28-year-period seemed to attribute subdued rainfall and break spells during those years to cold air intrusions.
 
 “Our analysis of the monsoon in 2014 showed that the cold, dry and ozone-rich air invasion into north India may have led to monsoon reduction for a longer period then. It may have additionally contributed to deficient rainfall in June 2014. The analysis, therefore, indicates that intrusion of such dry and ozone rich air from the higher altitudes into the Indian region may be one of the major factors influencing monsoon deficits in India,” Fadnavis said.
 
 The monsoon is known to have deep convective clouds. “Such deep cloud formation would indeed be hampered by the cold and dry air invasion into the monsoon trough region in north India. This region is known for its monsoon lows and depressions, giving a significant amount of rainfall,” Chattopadhyay said.
