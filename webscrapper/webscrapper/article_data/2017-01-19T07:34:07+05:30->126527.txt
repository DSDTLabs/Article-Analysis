PATNA: The   on Wednesday rejected independent Mokama MLA Anant Singh’s plea for revoking the Crime Control Act (CCA) under which he has been incarcerated for a year since September last year.

 Patna DM   invoked the CCA against Singh as several cases of murder, extortion and kidnapping are lodged against him in different police stations. The district administration initiated the move on the recommendation of Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj after Singh procured bail in all cases except one against him. 
 
 Singh’s movement outside the prison may create law and order problem, the SSP had feared.
 
 Sources said a division bench of Justice   and Justice Sanjay Priya rejected the MLA’s plea, citing his criminal antecedents. The court also did not find any illegality in the DM’s order.
