HYDERABAD: The forest department is seeking custody of the three accused currently in judicial remand in the March 19   case in Bhupalpally. The department expects to receive custody of Nallavelu Sathyanarayana, Khaleemulla Khan and Asrar Ahmed, who were arrested by the Bhupalpally police. “Once the prisoner on transit (PT) warrants are obtained, we will have an opportunity to question them,” a forest department official said.

 The police have so far named nine people as accused. While three are in custody, the others — Akbar Khan, a TRS leader from Mahadevpur, Faisal Ahmed Khan from Hyderabad, Jalal, Munna, Mobin and Gattaiah — are absconding.   appears to be well known in TRS circles and it was in his farm-cum-guest house in Mahadevpur that the hunting gang met. Gattaiah claims to be a mandal-level TRS leader as per posters put up during the 2015 Godavari Pushkaralu. Kaleshwaram in Bhupalpally district was one of the popular pilgrim sites during the 12-day festival.
 
 Police have also admitted that more than one vehicle was involved in the poaching, a fact that was denied in the first few days after the incident. In addition to the   car that was seized along with two carcasses of Chital or spotted deer, the Bhupalpally police said that while Faizal drove the Indica from Hyderabad, Munna drove a Maruti Gypsy and Mobin reached the location in his Volkswagen-Vento car. 
 
 On March 19 evening, the gang consumed alcohol and left to hunt in the Palimela forest area. With them they carried two ‘sporting rifles’, 30-06 gauge guns, one each belonging to Shikari Sathyam and Akbar Khan. The police also said that Akbar Khan, Faizal, Gattaiah, Munna, and Mobin stayed behind at the farm in Pankena while the others went into the forest to hunt. The police said that the gang left behind the Gypsy and the Vento and used the Tata Indica for the hunting trip.
