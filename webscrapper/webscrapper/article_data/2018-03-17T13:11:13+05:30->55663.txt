NEW DELHI:  's high commissioner to India, 
  to discuss  , won't be returning any time soon, a senior source in   told The Express Tribune.

 
 Both India and Pakistan have accused each other of 
  and making it difficult to work or even live peacefully.
 
 The Pakistan envoy,  , who was called back home on Thursday, was expected to return to India in a few days, but he won't "until Indian secret agencies stop harassing ...(Pakistani) diplomatic staff and their families", the Pakistan foreign ministry source said. 
  
 "Children have never been harassed even when two countries have had the worst of relationship," said the official, who added that under the circumstances it was not possible for Mahmood to operate out of New Delhi. 
 
  
  
 That means Mahmood will stay back in Pakistan indefinitely the source said, harking back to the situation in 2002 when the two countries recalled their respective high commissioners following the attack on India's Parliament in December 2001.
 
 Amid signs that the ongoing diplomatic standoff could worsen further, Pakistan on Friday also pulled out of the WTO ministerial meeting which will be held in India next week on March 19-20.
 
 While Indian officials continue to maintain that all "genuine" allegations made by the Pakistan high commission will be investigated, Islamabad has accused the Indian government of denying the "validity of its complaints".
 
 According to Pakistan, while aggressive tailing has happened in the past two days, the "nature, scale and intensity" of recent incidents of alleged harassment by Indian authorities has never been witnessed before. In its latest note verbale, Pakistan said that despite the matter being brought to the attention of foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale, such incidents had continued.
