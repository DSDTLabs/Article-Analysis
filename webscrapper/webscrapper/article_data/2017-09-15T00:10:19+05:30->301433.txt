 Members of various resident welfare association said despite many complaints given to the municipal corporation (MC) officials, nothing has been done by them till now.
 
 “We cannot call it a road anymore. They have now turned into a dirt track and we need dirt vehicles to drive through it. Normal cars and two-wheelers cannot be driven here.”
 
 Besides this, during rainy season, these roads turn into a dangerous site as water gets collected in the potholes. 
 
 Minor accidents are a daily affair now, said residents.

 Officials said, “Potholes are filled with stones and sand. As soon as they settle on the road, the work of recarpetting will be started.”
 
 Manish Kumar, a local shopkeeper and a resident of Shiva Enclave, said, “Whenever a car or a motorbike passes by, the sand blows and a fog of sand always remain on the road. So, just filling the craters with sand has not worked out.”
