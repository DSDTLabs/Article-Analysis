Several teenagers from Sanvordem, a village in the hinterlands of the Quepem taluka, have taken to the stage to display their acting prowess in Hortencio Pereira’s production, ‘Hanv Vetam’ (I am going). The tiatr narrates the tale of some children who are abandoned by the roadside. A goon eventually finds them and decides to raise them, going on to inculcate all his sordid traits in their impressionable minds.  “What I have sought to convey is that if these children were provided with love instead of being beaten up, they could have easily become better people,” Pereira said. Besides the 13-year-old Joyrus Mascarenhas being a part of the musical troupe that comprises Joaquim Fernandes on the saxophone, Melroy on the bass guitar, Magney on the drums and Benny on the keyboards, there are also the teenage twin brothers, Shane and Shawn Sequeira. The other youngsters performing in ‘Hanv Vetam’ are Reyan Vales, Reuben and Milburn who enact the comedy sequences along with comedian Milbon.  The rest of the cast comprise Parag Sabnis, Camilo Mascarenhas, John de Cacora, Cajetan de Cacora, Paulin Fernandes, Presley, Renath, Suzanne, Fleffy, Raiza, Lyanne and the director himself.  While Satish Dessai does the lighting effects, stage sets are managed by Urmila Gaonkar. Pereira, claims to have stepped onto the tiatr stage 25 years after having performed alongside stalwarts such as Remmie Colaco, Aristides Dias, Robin Vaz, Alfred Rose, C Alvares, Bab Peter, M Boyer, Prem Kumar, Anil Kumar, Chris Perry, John Claro, Jose Rod and Anthony San.
