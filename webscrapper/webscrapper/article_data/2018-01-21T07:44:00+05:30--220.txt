Patiala: Following efforts put in by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), major pharmaceutical companies having their manufacturing plants in and around Derabassi in Mohali district have decided to come up with a Rs 80-crore common effluent treatment plant (CETP).

 Showing environmental concerns, the pharmaceutical companies have formulated a formed special purpose vehicle (SPV) and finalized setting up of CETP with their own funds.
 
 According to PPCB chairperson KS Pannu, a large number of pharmaceutical companies have their manufacturing units in the Derabassi cluster. The effluents being released by these units find its way into the Ghaggar, affecting the water quality in this seasonal river of the state.
 
 Pannu said the board had also been receiving constant complaints of pollution caused by the effluent of these industries and to permanently solve the problem of effluent pollution and obviate the need for having individual effluent treatment plants, which were quite costly in installation and operation, the PPCB persuaded these units to set up of common effluent treatment facility in the area.
 
 The Derabassi municipal committee had already given a piece of land on lease for the setting up of a CETP. A Singapore-based company has been picked up for setting up the plant which would be constructed on build-operate-transfer basis.
 
 While appreciating the initiative taken by the industries, Pannu had also directed them to complete the project in a time-bound manner before June 2019. President of the SPV N R Munjal said in addition to the effluent from the units, the CETP would also treat sewage water of ponds of adjoining villages as a part of the corporate social responsibility. He added that water treated at the CETP would be reused by the industry and as such the plant would work on zero liquid discharge technology (ZLD).
