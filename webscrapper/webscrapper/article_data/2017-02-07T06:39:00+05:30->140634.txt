KOLKATA: The brother of the   student, who has been missing since Thursday after being accused of molestation by another student on a social networking site, lodged a complaint against five youngsters from the varsity on Monday. 

 The accused are all JU students, including the girl who brought the charge against Sushil Mandi, who is pursuing MPhil in linguistics after completing engineering. 
 
 Confirming the complaint he lodged at the Jadavpur police station, Sushil’s brother Haradhan claimed the five mentally tortured Sushil, a member of the students’ group, Radical. He supported the causes of Santhals and other tribal communities. Immediately after the   was registered and Haradhan held a press meet, members of Radical and rival group   clashed with each other.
 
 A source claimed trouble started a few days ago when Sushil was sharing a smoke with a girl from the film studies department. While taking the cigarette back, he allegedly touched her inappropriately, but the girl reportedly did not approach the grievance redressal committee or police. Instead, she wrote a post on a social networking site, charging Sushil of molestation. Ostensibly depressed over the allegation, Sushil left the university hostel, where he stayed, on Thursday morning.
 
 Haradhan on Monday claimed the girl could have raised the issue on the platforms but she, along with others, chose to mentally torture him. A Radical spokesperson also alleged it was “inappropriate of her to malign his image on a social networking site”.
 
 Alleging police inaction, PG II student and   member Triparna said, “The students’ group shouldn’t malign the girl, she is not found guilty yet.” 
 
 While vice-chancellor Suranjan Das could not be reached, registrar Pradeep Ghosh declined to speak.
