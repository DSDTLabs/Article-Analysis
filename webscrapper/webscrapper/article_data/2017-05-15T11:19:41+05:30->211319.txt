BHOPAL: A one-time waiver is being offered by the state government to regularise over a lakh illegal constructions in the state capital. The compounding fee over penalty is expected to be slashed to barely 2% to 5% of building permission fee. The decision, now effective is to benefit many across the city, who have constructed structures by exceeding building permission area limit.

 It paves the way for regularisation for millions of square feet excess built-up area in Bhopal. Instead of paying compounding penalisation calculated at collectorate rate, the new one-time waiver compounding would be calculated at building permission. Simply put, instead of paying regulation fee in lakhs, the amount would come down to thousands.
 
 “The policy is aimed at regularisation of illegal structures. It is a one-time waiver,” said   additional commissioner Malika Nigam. 
 
 Impact of the waiver from the state government is expected to result in a revenue loss of about Rs 80 crore for the   (BMC) alone. As per new estimates, BMC revenue from regularisation would dip to around Rs 12 crore. 
 
 There are an estimated more than one lakh constructions in Bhopal, which have exceeded construction beyond their deemed building permission. The construction exceeding building permission were earlier regularised at the rate of 10% to 40% of the collectorate rate of land. The new waiver would be 2% to 5% of the building permission fee.
 
 Experts indicate new waiver would mean a lesser penalisation for violation of building permission. For instance, a plot of 1,000 sq feet with built area for permission 800 sq feet has been extended to 900 sq feet. Under the old rules, the compounding for residential construction was calculated at 10 times the collectorate rate of the property in the area (for the extended construction). Under the new waiver, the penalisation would be 5 times of the BMC building permission rate.
