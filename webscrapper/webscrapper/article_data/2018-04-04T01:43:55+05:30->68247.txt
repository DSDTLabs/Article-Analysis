NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal ( ) has directed the Delhi government to act against unauthorised water extraction and directed it to   all illegal   in the capital within two  .

 A bench headed by Justice Jawad Rahim in its order has also asked the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to submit a list of all illegal borewells.
 
 The directions were made after the government informed the tribunal that it could not seal illegal borewells as it did not have complete information about them. 
 
 The counsel appearing for DJB, however, claimed that it had already furnished details about 4,872 borewells to the concerned officers.
 
 “We direct the DJB to once again furnish fresh set of statements to the counsel representing the Delhi government and department of revenue to avoid such controversy in the future. Upon furnishing of such information, the counsel shall take further steps and ensure that deputy commissioner concerned comply with the orders of this tribunal dated January 30, 2018 within two weeks,” the bench said.
 
 The green tribunal has posted the matter for further hearing on April 27.
