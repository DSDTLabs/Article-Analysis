HYDERABAD: A Class 1 student of Prashanthi Vidyanikethan, Vanasthalipuram, fell off the school bus and was crushed under its rear tyre on Saturday. Five-year-old   was standing near the door when she was tossed out of the vehicle after the driver swerved the bus near a speed breaker and slammed on the brakes, 500m from her home. The bus also didn't have helper to keep children seated or make them stay away from the open door. 

 Late on Saturday, Rachakonda police finally registered a case against school management and driver for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Earlier, Vanasthalipuram police were waiting for the parents to lodge a complaint.
 
 "Like every day, she boarded the bus for school and was mowed down by the same vehicle. The bus didn't have a door, only a rope tied to its exit," said Anjali's uncle, Ramu.
 
 "Instead of slowing down near the speed breaker, the driver tried to veer past and this jolted kids inside. Anjali, who was standing near the open exit lost balance and fell off the vehicle." Family members demanded the government take action against the school and driver.
 
 Child rights activists said negligence of the school management and rash driving caused death of the child. "While elder children were made to sit in the back, younger ones were made to sit near the entrance, which did not even have a proper door. This is sheer apathy on part of school management," said  ,  . 
 
  alleged the school is not recognized by the government and was also not following fire safety norms nor has a playground. After the tragedy, the school declared a holiday and officials went into hiding.
