HYDERABAD: Even after various   and many court orders directed   around the   (or Oora Cheruvu), it continues to shrink in size.

 According to residents of surrounding areas, even as existing encroachments have not been removed -keeping with the   of March 2016 -new structures continue to sprout up within the Full Tank Level (FTL) and buffer zone of the water body. “The tennis court, which was identified by the AP irrigation department as one of the largest encroachments on the water body, has not been demolished and has recently been expanded in direct contempt of the HC order,“ said Satish Kumar, one of the petitioners of the PIL, filed in July last year. The high court directive had ordered the builders: “to removedemolish the compound wall constructed between Pillar Nos 6and 7, tennis court between Pillar Nos 7 and 8 and badminton court between Pillar Nos 8 and 9.“ This order was issued post an inspection, conducted by the AP irrigation department.
 
 When TOI contacted Shekhar Reddy, superintending engi neer, lakes and water bodies, GHMC, he argued that all the encroachments, falling inside the buffer zone and the FTL of the lake, have been removed. However, residents refuted his claims.
 
 “The indoor badminton court, which was supposed to be removed was officially inaugurated on February 5. No demolitions have taken place, barring removal of only 3 feet of the 72 ft compound wall. Violations are occurring right under the nose of irrigation officials. It seems as if the state government is in support of land grabbing,“ said K Sastry, a resident of Keesara Mandal, who has been crusading to protect the lake.
