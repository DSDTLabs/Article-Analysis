MUMBAI: In a desperate attempt to get rid of the huge quantity of   lying in  , the government has decided to mill   into tur dal and sell it to its own departments at a lower cost of Rs 55 per kg from the previous rate of Rs 75-80 per kg. 

 A kg of  , including the purchase cost, is Rs 58.5 and if the selling price is Rs 55, there will be an additional subsidy of Rs 3.5 per kg. Additionally, there is a Rs 100-crore interest on a loan the government took to buy the legume from farmers in 2017 to stabilize falling prices. Also, a huge amount has been paid as rent for nearly a year to use godowns for stocking tur.
 
 The state government bought 25 lakh quintals of the legume for Rs 5,050 per quintal from over 30 lakh farmers. Officials say that from the total tur stock, nearly 17 lakh quintals of dal can be produced after milling, the remaining being a byproduct. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that Rs 59.5 crore will be the additional subsidy borne by the government owing to the Rs 3.5 difference in the buying and selling cost. The estimated cost to the government, including interest on loans and rent of 153 godowns (Rs 1.5 crore a month; tur has been stored in them for nearly a year now), comes to a total of Rs 300 crore, said officials.
 
 In a meeting headed by chief secretary   earlier last week, it was decided to sell tur dal to the school education department, which uses it in the midday meal scheme, and to the home department for use in jail canteens. Also, temple trusts like Shirdi and Shegaon will be asked and their requirements taken. In addition, the woman and child department will be supplied with dal for using in anganwadis.
