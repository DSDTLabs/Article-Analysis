LUDHIANA: Rail commuters are facing a tough time travelling through the city railway station, as the   authorities have demolished 15 food kiosks — many of whom were serving baby food to frequent travellers — in the past three months, as their contracts had expired.

 In the absence of authorized food kiosks at various platforms, unauthorized vendors are taking advantage of the situation, and serving food that does not meet proper food safety standards. Another major problem for passengers was that they could not find baby food items from other food kiosks, which are also on the verge of closing, as their contract terms come to an end in the last week of January.
 
 During a visit to Ludhiana railway station, it was found that 15 food and daily commodities stalls were demolished by authorities after their term was over, but that has created problems for women with babies and senior citizens, as they have to reach other platforms to get daily essential commodities like milk, juice, food, and snacks. Sources said with the demolition of food kiosks, Northern Railways authorities faced a loss of Rs50 to Rs60 lakh last year. Moreover, contractors whose stalls were shut down by the authorities are very angry, as the railways did not give them any notice before taking the harsh step of closure.
 
 “Earlier, railway authorities had given us some relaxations until new tenders were floated, but this time, they have taken the decision to shut down 15 food stalls serving baby food and other essential commodities to passengers day and night throughout the year,” stated  , the owner of a food stall at the station for the past eight years.
 
 Monu  , senior divisional commercial manager at  , articulated: “Some stalls were closed by the railway authorities after their contract period came to an end. Railways is also considering the plight of passengers, and will soon bring out a new baby food stall policy for private contractors waiting to run the closed food stalls.”
