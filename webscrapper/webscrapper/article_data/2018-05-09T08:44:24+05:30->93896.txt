CHENNAI: The absence of elected local body officials has left services in municipalities and panchayats outside the city limits in a shambles.   and   locals complain that basic issues like sweeping of roads, garbage collection and overseeing drainage are not taken care of as officials remain blind to the interest of residents.

 For A Roy Rozario, of   in  , calling the   has become a daily chore. The reason being while residents of nearby houses leave their trash along the street they live on, it is not being cleared by conservancy workers. Many have flooded the municipality office with petitions related to sewage, garbage and encroachments, but the issues prevail.
 
 “Sewage through illegal connections make way to the drains, and garbage has begun stagnating. Despite bringing this to the notice of officials, no action has been taken,” said Lenin Charles, another resident.
 
 Meanwhile, Kovilambakkam residents have been battling sewage that has been overflowing inside their compounds for several weeks. Despite repeated complaints, a solution remained evasive.
 
 When contacted, Avadi municipal commissioner C Mathivanan said that door-to-door segregation occurs everyday. “Garbage is to be collected from each street, besides cleaning of the streets. I will look into the issue and revert,” he told TOI.
 
 The scenario is not any better in panchayats where residents remain unaware as to whom to approach. On a visit to   regarding dumping of garbage along a canal, TOI found only a clerk present. The executive officer was said to be on rounds.
 
 In another incident, a resident of Iyyapanthangal submitted a petition to the   clerk at the Gram Sabha meeting that was held on May 1. Only an ex-president of the panchayat and a clerk were present during the meeting.
 
 “It is a political ball-game. Those who are not in power still are making money with their political connections,” said David Manohar of Arappor Iyyakam.
