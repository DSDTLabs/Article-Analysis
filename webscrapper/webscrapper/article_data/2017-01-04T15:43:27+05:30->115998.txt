INDORE: The trial against   Safdar Nagori and 10 other operatives through   is scheduled to begin at the   here from Wednesday. The trial will be held at another room, where the video conferencing set up is installed, on district court premises. 

 The order for holding trial through video conferencing was passed by special   Judge BK Paloda during the last hearing held in October, 2016. 
 
 Also, the trial was fixed for three days from January 4, 5 and 6. However, due to the declaration of leave on account of Prakash Parv, the trial can now be held only on January 4 and 6. 
 
 On the first day, prosecution witnesses Ajay Kaithwas, the then in-charge of Tirla police station will record the remaining part of his testimony along with independent witness Shyamlal. On January 6, statements of investigating officer in the case, BPS Parihar, will be recorded at the court. 
 
 The reason for conducting the trial by video conferencing was attributed to security issues involved in bringing the 11 accused from Ahmedabad's Sabarmati jail to Indore's central jail. The prosecution during last hearing had submitted an application seeking transfer of the accused to Indore, which was dismissed by the court on the grounds that many cases were pending against them before Gujarat's court. The Gujarat state government has also issued a restraining order against their transfer to any other state till the end of the trial. "This is a lot more convenient and helpful way of conducting trial. The accused attracted a lot of attention when they appeared for trial," Chandan Airen, defense advocate said.
