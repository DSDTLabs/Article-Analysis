BATHINDA: Two factions of   in Bathinda led by Punjab finance minister   and former MLA Harminder Singh Jassi held separate protests, including fasts, on Monday against the happenings of April 2 Bharat Bandh by Dalit organisations in favour of SCs/STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The call for protests by Congress president Rahul Gandhi failed to unify the factions.

 Congress workers owing allegiance to Manpreet held the protest at his office near the multipurpose sports stadium while the group headed by Jassi observed a fast at the district Congress committee office near the railway station here. In Manpreet Badal’s absence, his wife Vinu Badal and brother-in-law   sat on the protest, along with its district urban unit chief Mohan Lal Jhumba and Congress workers. They accused Prime Minister   of trying to divide the country on religious lines and also not working for the welfare of SC/STs.
 
 On the other hand, along with Jassi, Punjab Congress secretary  , district Congress unit general secretary Rupinder Bindra and many other local leaders sat on the protest.
 
 Sources said differences had cropped up between Manpreet and Jassi, who were once close to each other. Jassi is a close relative of rape convict Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim. He survived the bomb blast in Maur town of Bathinda on January 31, 2017, just four days ahead of the Punjab assembly elections in which seven persons were killed.
 
 Jassi said according to the directions given by Congress high command they held a protest at the district Congress committee office. “I do not know about other Congress workers sitting in the private office of the minister. Every member should have protested at the party office,” he said. Jhumba said that, “The call for protest was given by the AICC president. Every party leader should have held the fast on one platform. Holding separate programmes is not justified.”
