HUBBALLI: Residents of Hullikeri, Kadabagatti and surrounding villages in Dharwad heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday when forest department personnel managed to drive elephants, which had created panic in the area, back to the forest.

 Villagers were worried about their paddy and mango cultivations as they had spotted six elephants moving in their fields two days ago. “When I went to work in my field, I noticed four elephants standing in the middle of the mango grove. They might have strayed into our village from the Khanapur forest area,” said Gururaj, a villager.
 
 A team of forest department officials spent Tuesday night in the village to protect people from being attacked by the wild animals. They beat drums and burst crackers to drive the elephants back to the Nagaralli forest area.
 
 MD Lamani, deputy range officer, Benasi range, Dharwad, said they will compensate farmers if there is any crop loss after getting a report from the local authority.
