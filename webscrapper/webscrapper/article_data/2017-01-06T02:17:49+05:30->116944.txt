GURUGRAM: The death of a 21-year-old woman, who succumbed to her burn injuries on Monday after her husband and parents-in-law allegedly poured kerosene on her and set her on fire, is the first dowry-related death in the city this year. But last year, Gurgaon saw an almost 70% rise in   cases as compared to 2015.

 In 2015, the city witnessed some 12 cases where women were either   or committed suicide following demands of dowry from their husbands and parents-in-law, while the figure rose to 20 in 2016.
 
 In September last year, a 31-year-old woman killed herself in the family’s apartment in Sector 14 unable to meet her husband’s dowry demands. Her husband, Ramadhar Sharma, a scientist, has been absconding since the suicide. Similarly, a 24-year-old woman committed suicide in Kadarpur. Her parents alleged that her husband, Atul, and parents-in-law had been harassing her for dowry.
 
 In July, a woman drowned her one-year-old daughter and ended her own life allegedly on demands of dowry from her parents-in-law. The incident took place in Pataudi. Earlier in 2016, a Civil Hospital doctor killed herself in the family home in Sushant Lok, and her husband, also a doctor, Ajay Kumar, was booked for dowry death.
 
 In 2016, there was a rise in cases of dowry   too. An increase of almost 20% was witnessed in cases of dowry harassment in the city last year as compared to 2015 — the number of cases in 2015 stood at 268, while in 2016, it rose to 315.
 
 City-based activist Jyotsna Chatterjee, the founder-director of the  , said the rise in numbers in dowry-related deaths is alarming. “The notion of dowry is a deep-seated patriarchal idea, and it comes with a preference for a male child, which is prominent in Haryana. One of the reasons for this is that the man determines dowry in the family,” she said.
