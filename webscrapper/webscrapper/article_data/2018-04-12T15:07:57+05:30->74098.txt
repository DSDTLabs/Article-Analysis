KOLHAPUR: The civic adminsitration recently conducted a survey in which it found 145 shops located in the   area need to apply for licences.

 Last month, the Bombay high court upheld the  's (KMC) petition stating the area falls under its jurisdiction and not in the Uchgaon gram panchayat limits. Some shops have mushroomed on the reserved plots of  . Shop owners claim they had obtained permission from Uchgaon gram panchayat much before the jurisdiction issue was resolved. 
 
 A couple of days ago, KMC's licence department sealed a liquor shop owned by a Gandhinagar based trader for not obtaining a licence from KMC and deemed the shop illegal.
 
 Licence superintendent of KMC Sachin Jadhav said, “We are going to issue notices to 145 shops to obtain a licence from the KMC as now the area comes under our jurisdiction. Shop operators had applied for a licence from the gram panchayat, they had not approached KMC. Now that the high court has resolved the matter, they must apply for a licence from us as the license from the gram panchayat is no longer valid.”
 
 However, officials claim they have to wait for further directions from the state government which directed civic chief Abhijeet Chaudhari on Tuesday not to initiate action against the constructions in the Tawade Hotel area until further orders. 
 
 Jadhav said he does not know whether the directions apply to the shops as the meeting was arranged for resolving the issue surrounding the 19 constructions which were built when the status quo over KMC’s demolition drive was in place in 2014. “We will consult higher authorities in our regular meetings and accordingly take further steps,” said Jadhav.
