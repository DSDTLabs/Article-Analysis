PATNA: Chaotic scenes were witnessed at Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport on Thursday night and Friday morning as passengers of a Delhi-Patna-Delhi   flight demanded refund after the aircraft got delayed for more than 14 hours owing to bad weather in   last night.

 SpiceJet’s SG-8481, which was scheduled to take off from   at 9.35pm on Thursday, reportedly arrived at 11.30am on Friday. The delay was attributed to adverse weather conditions due to which the   from Delhi to Patna was diverted to Varanasi.
 
 An airport official confirmed that the flight carrying around 50 passengers to Delhi took off from Patna airport at 12 noon on Friday. The airport officials cited several reasons like adjustment of delayed flight with the scheduled ones and shift change of pilots who had been on duty beyond their schedule time.
 
 But the passengers claimed the airline did not provide the right information about the flight, which caused immense inconvenience to them. One of the passengers, who spent the night at Patna airport, said the airline first issued a revised timing of 10.30pm for the departure. “However, when I reached the airport, the airline officials said the flight had not taken off from Varanasi. Later, they claimed the flight will take off at 11.30pm and then changed it to 12.30am,” he said.
 
 “After further delay, the airline assured accommodation to the angry passengers in a nearby hotel, but didn’t provide even basic facilities like food or water. I asked them to refund my money, but the officials didn’t respond,” another passenger said.
