Vadodara: M S University (MSU) students will now have to seek prior permission from their faculty’s dean for protests or making any representations.

 A joint meeting of MSU vice-chancellor Parimal Vyas, registrar Neerja Jaiswal, assistant commissioner of police (A Division), deans of faculties and Sayajigunj police inspector H B Vora was held on Wednesday in the wake of ruckus witnessed at the head office on Tuesday.
 
 “The meeting was held to discuss granting permission to students’ groups to hold protest and make representations in a democratic way. The deans were asked to maintain a uniformity in giving permissions to the groups,” said Chavda.
 
 He added that deans were also told not to permit students to hold any protests when classes are on. “If students want to hold protests outside university campus, they would have to take our permission and if they plan to give memorandum to the dean, then they should take permission in advance,” said Chavda.
 
 “The issue on which the students are protesting have nothing to do with the university and large number of students may not be interested in it. If they want to protest, the students can go to other places like collector’s office because the collector can forward their representations to the government,” said Vyas.
 
 The deans of faculties have also been asked to hold meetings with student groups and sensitize them that the interests of common students should also be taken care of. During the meeting, it was also discussed that the CCTV network and surveillance in the university campus should also be improved.
