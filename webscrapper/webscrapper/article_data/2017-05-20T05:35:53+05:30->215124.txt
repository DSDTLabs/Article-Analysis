LUCKNOW: The   of   on the   shows that all is not right with our environment. According to scientists, a river trapped with water hyacinths indicates an  

 “A large part of the river has been taken over by water hyacinths. The stagnant water is leading to a choking smell,” said NBRI senior principal scientist SK Tewari. 
 
 In summer, when water evaporates from the Gomti, the river requires extra water to be released from Sharda Canal by the irrigation department. If that doesn’t happen, algae and water hyacinth are formed on the surface, Jal Sansthan said. 
 
  Irrigation department is supposed to release 100 cusecs of water from Sharda Canal to   in April and May every year. This has been mandated by a government order issued 15 years ago. “This year, though the water was released in April, it was stopped midway due to construction of a railway bridge over a canal in Bareilly. We will request irrigation department to soon release water in May too,” said Jal Sansthan secretary Neeraj Gaur. 
 
 According to Tewari, hyacinth either grows due to stagnation or eutrophication—excessive richness of nutrients in a water body after run-off from land. Since there is not much agricultural land near the Gomti, water stagnation is believed to be the reason for the growth, he added.
 
 Water hyacinths prevent sunlight from reaching aquatic plants and destroy them, he said. As oxygen level in the water body drops, plants and animals suffocate. Some fish species either die or migrate, said river scientist Venkatesh Dutta .
 
 “Hyacinth leads to changes in water chemistry. As there is a dip in oxygen, fish come to the surface for it. At the surface, water hyacinth obstructs oxygen, leading to death,” he added.
