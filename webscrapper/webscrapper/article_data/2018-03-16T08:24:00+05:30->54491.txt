RAJKOT: Even three days after a fire broke out at   gutting jute sacks worth Rs 18 crore, police is yet to ascertain the cause of fire — whether it was accidental or manmade. 

 Cops on Thursday released   footage of the incident in which one suspect is seen coming out from behind the market yard just few minutes before the fire broke out. Police is searching for the person. 
 
 The massive fire that broke out on Tuesday evening gutted 20 lakh jute bags worth Rs 18 crore. The bags were stocked for packaging groundnut procured at minimum support price (MSP) by the government agencies. 
 
 Rajkot city ACP (east) B B Rathod said, “There are 1,000 labourers working in the market yard and we have issued lookout for one person which takes time. Till we nab that person, we can’t say if the fire was an accident or manmade.” 
 
 A petrochemical solution was spread over the jute bags to compress the bags which would accommodate double numbers of bags in the same space. This petrochemical is inflammable and easily catches fire. Police is also waiting for a report by forensic science experts.tnn
