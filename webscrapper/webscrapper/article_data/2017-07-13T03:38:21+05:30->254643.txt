Mumbai: The   (EOW) of the city police has written to the   seeking its opinion on whether a case can be registered against the  , K S Chamankar, for allegedly duping a developer,  , of Rs 280 crore.

 Mehta submitted a complaint to the EOW last month. In his complaint, he stated that during his meetings with Chamankar, the latter offered him   projects or his share. 
 
 A police officer said that as per Mehta’s complaint, Chamankar gave a proposal to the state government asking for FSI to be used on RTO land in lieu of his work to construct the Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi, a state guest house at Malabar Hill, and an RTO office building. “Mehta has claimed to have invested Rs 280 crore in Chamankar’s projects between 2004 and 2009,” said the officer. Since the Maharashtra Sadan case got into legal complications and the ACB registered a case, Mehta neither got his money back nor the projects he was promised.
 
 “We are seeking legal opinion whether a fresh case should be registered or it could be clubbed with the previous ACB case,” added the officer.
 
 The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had, in Febraury 2016, filed a chargesheet against against 17 persons, including former PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer and other senior PWD officers in the case. The ACB alleged that Bhujbal had allotted projects to a developer despite objections from the finance department and other departments concerned.
 
 The PWD had in 2005 awarded development rights of a slum on Andheri RTO land to developer Chamankar without inviting tenders on the condition that he would construct the Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi, a Regional Transport Office in Andheri and a state guest house in Malabar Hill for the government.
 
 When contacted, Chamankar told TOI: “The matter is already in ED court. The Prime Builders (where Mehta is a partner) have already submitted their account in the court. Mehta statement is recorded by ED which is part of the chargesheet.”
