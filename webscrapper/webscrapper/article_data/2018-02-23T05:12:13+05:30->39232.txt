PHULBARI (MEGHALAYA): Prime Minister   on Thursday tried to woo voters in Christian-majority Meghalaya by saying those who are spreading the “poison of communalism” among the people should know that it was his government which had rescued many Indians, mostly Christians, from the captivity of terrorists. 

 
 This comes a day after Congress president   attacked Modi over burning of churches and attacks on Christians in  . “I want to tell the people of Meghalaya that my government mobilised all its resources to free 46 Kerala nurses, mostly Christians, from IS captivity in Iraq last year. When Father Alexis Prem Kumar was abducted by Taliban in 2015, we rescued and united him with his family members. At one point, his family had lost all hope but we didn’t. It was a great moment of joy when we brought him back alive,” said Modi, while addressing a rally at this dusty town in West Garo Hills district. 
 
 He also spoke about the release of Father Tom Uzhunalil, who was abducted by Yemeni terrorists last year. “Those who are trying to spread the poison of communal hatred should know that our mantra is inclusive development,” said Modi. Urging the voters to give BJP a chance, he said, “The Mukul Sangma-led Congress government feels that the people of Meghalaya will vote for the party even if it doesn’t work for them. But this is not going to happen this time. There is anger among people as they are yet to taste the fruits of development.”
 
 “We approved construction of 21,000 houses in Meghalaya and provided Rs 100 crore to the state. But they were unable to build the required number of houses,” he said, adding that the Centre had provided around Rs470 crore for laying 1,100km of roads in the state under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, but the government was unable to spend even 50% of the money. A huge crowd gathered to see PM Modi at Muslim-majority Phulbari.
