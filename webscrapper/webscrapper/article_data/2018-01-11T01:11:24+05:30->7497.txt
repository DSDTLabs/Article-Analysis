MUMBAI: Soon, many of the foot overbridges (FOBs) on   will get “double-discharge” escalators- cum-staircases. These structures will allow commuters entry and exit to and from a station via an FOB on the same end of a platform. 

 While escalators are hugely popular in suburban stations, there is no provision for descending on a platform from the same end. Currently, entry to a platform in the direction of an escalator is not possible as the staircase next to it has been done away with or narrowed considerably to provide space for electrical fittings. WR division railway manager   said, “We will provide a double-discharge type of arrangement at around 29 locations. The general arrangement drawing is being prepared for locations where this is technically feasible.” WR is working on two designs for the purpose. 
 
 One, a staircase alongside an escalator. Two, a staircase above an escalator, similar to the one that already exists at  . WR chief public relations officer   said, “The doubledischarge system will ensure faster evacuation of passengers in and out of platforms.” Some of the work on the 29 locations will be done by WR and other by Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation. Mira Road’s Shyam Pandya said, “Borivli got this facility in 2015 and the railways should have made it the norm since it was appreciated by commuters and experts. 
 
 They only woke up because of the Elphinstone Road tragedy.” Malad’s Sonal Mehta said, “There have been instances where people have had to turn because of an escalator. This leads to chaos.” Meanwhile, authorities have also planned to interconnect FOBs to allow people mobility on an elevated level and avoid congested platforms.
