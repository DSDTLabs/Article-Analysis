NEW DELHI: Swarna Bharat Trust, in which NDA’s vice-presidential candidate Venkaiah Naidu’s daughter   is a key trustee, has asked   to refrain from dragging its name into unnecessary controversies as no notice was served to it for   violations.

 Congress had earlier raised the issue of Swarna Bharat Trust being issued a notice under FCRA.
 
 “Swarna Bharat Trust applied for FCRA registration in 2012 and received registration under FCRA in February 2013. 
 
 However, the trust subsequently decided not to receive any foreign contributions and in fact has not received any such contribution till date and wanted to close the account,” a statement issued by the trust said.
 
 It added that under FCRA rules, the account for receiving such contributions has to be maintained in only one bank and the FCRA account of the trust was with the Nellore branch of ICICI Bank.
 
 “On July 14, 2017, the bank had stated in writing ‘this is to certify that Swarna Bharat Trust FCRA is maintaining a current account with us bearing A/c No. 63100501407 since 14.11.2012 and there are nil transactions in this account from the date of account opening till date (14-07-2017)’,” the statement said.
 
 The trust maintained that since no foreign contributions were received, returns were not filed. “Assumption that not filing returns would result in cancellation of registration is also a reason for not filing returns since the trust has decided to have the registration cancelled,” it said. 
 
 It said the trust was not a family concern and Naidu was not associated with day-to-day management of the trust’s affairs. “The trust is being run and managed by 10 trustees. The trust has been deeply involved since 2001 in empowering rural youth with necessary skills for self and wage employment and its contributions are widely acknowledged,” it said.
