KOLKATA:The   roads department has formed a dedicated team to repair some the stretches that have developed huge craters following continuous rain over the last few days. Major roads that have failed to bear the waterlogging brunt include Diamond Harbour Road, EM Bypass, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Chitpore Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road and NSC Bose Road, among others. “We have kept a roadrepair team ready, which will swing into action from Wednesday. We need to wind up the work by next two weeks,” said a KMC roads department official.

 Perhaps the biggest casualty of poor road conditions and inclement weather was the city’s traffic. As vehicles broke down at several places due to waterlogging and potholes, huge snarls were reported from EM Bypass, Maa flyover, Park Circus, Alipore Road, Belvedere Road and Diamond Harbour Road all through Tuesday morning. While two buses broke down on EM Bypass and Alipore Road, waterlogging was reported from Maa flyover. In fact, the situation turned so nightmarish by 10am that senior officers – including additional CP Vineet Goel and DC (traffic) Solomon V Nesakumar — had to rush to different locations to control the traffic mess. Taking cognizance of the situation, police convinced the KMC brass to carry out some patchwork on certain stretches – notably Behala Chowrasta – to ease traffic flow. KMC even arranged for a pump to flush out stagnant water near Behala Chowrashta. A political procession between   and Y Channel in the evening – along with the shutting down of Lenin Sarani and Indian Mirror Street after the house collapse — added to traffic woes.
