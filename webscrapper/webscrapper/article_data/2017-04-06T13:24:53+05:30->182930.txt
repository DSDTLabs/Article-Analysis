VISAKHAPATNAM: Getting your name into the   is never easy. In fact an  , which is famous for its  , is finding it more challenging to get his name into the world record books as compared to his efforts in making the world’s smallest chessboard measuring a mere  . 

 Unable to show the quality of his miniature art due to lack of access to high precision camera equipment, 39-year-old artisan S Chinnayachari has now made a 5 millimetre chessboard to make his art more visible and get a chance to make it to the record books.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Chinnayachari said, “I have used cactus thorns to make the pawns on the chessboard. Each pawn in the 1.1 mm chessboard is less than about 0.1 mm. I had to work for nearly 28 days to make the 1.1 mm chessboard while it took me 18 days to make the 5.5 mm board.” Noting that making miniature structures requires high levels of concentration, Chinnayachari said, “I spend around six hours a day making the miniature boards. When making these miniatures, we need to have good concentration.”
 
 Disappointed that his 1.1mm chessboard was rejected by the Guinness Book of World Records last year, he said, “The quality of the pictures are not good enough. It appears as a graphic for them because of which they perhaps rejected the application. But, I’m hoping that the 5.5 mm chessboard will be recorded as the smallest in the world soon. I’ve already applied for the record and am hoping it will be selected in the coming days.”
 
 Chinnayachari has made various miniature models including that of the   (which is fixed on top of a paper pin), parrots on a single strand of hair, a stork feeding its young ones on a hair or for that matter the musical instrument Veena on a grain of rice.
 
 Each of these models are as small as the tip of a pen or the head of a pin. Armed with sewing needles, a magnifying glass and cactus thorns, Chinnayachari usually takes between 15 days to a month depending on the model he is working on to complete.
