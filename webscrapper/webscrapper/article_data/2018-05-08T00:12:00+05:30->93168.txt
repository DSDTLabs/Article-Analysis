Jaipur: All is not well at Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC). The power tussle between city mayor Ashok Lahoti and   chief executive officer Ravi Jain (CEO) is getting intense as both are quashing orders of each other. 

 The fight for supremacy continued on Monday when Lahoti gave directions to the JMC officials to call a round table meeting before inviting tenders to carry out desilting work of drains as monsoon is approaching.
 
 However, JMC CEO refused to call any such meeting and also issued a circular on Monday. Sources at JMC said, “The CEO has mentioned in Rajasthan Transparency in Public Procurement (RTPP) Rules that there is no provision to call round table meeting for inviting tenders. In the round table meeting, the officials are pressurised to invite the tenders. Also, round table conference is a tedious process. In case, there is a delay in inviting tenders, the officials are hold responsible,” he said.
 
 This is not for the first time that mayor and CEO has come face to face. Earlier, dispute occurred after mayor expressed dissatisfaction over the functioning of Jaipur Smart City Limited officials and raised a question mark on their planning.
 
 In October 2017, mayor had asked detailed work of projects initiated under smart city projects after issuing a notesheet. “The mayor has sought details of JSCL undergoing projects. He also examined the tenders invited for various projects and detailed project report (DPR).”
 
 Sources said, the public representatives in the city had also expressed that majority of projects under smart city mission are information technology (IT) based and not proving useful information to common man. 
 
 Lahoti earlier alleged that Jaipur Smart City Limited (JSCL) is wasting money in hiring consultants. Moreover, there was no requirement of consultancy for projects such as Walled City’s underground cabling, solar energy and facade development as tenders are been invited on engineering, procurement.
