CHANDIGARH: Leader of   (CLP) in   Kiran Choudhry on Wednesday demanded   inquiry into   at Dadam stone quarry in Bhiwani district, which not only “constituted a grave violation of the Supreme Court orders banning mining in the Aravalis, but also damaged the ecology beyond repair in the area.”

 The former excise and taxation minister asked the BJP government led by chief minister   to explain how rampant mining was allowed to go on unchecked despite specific Supreme Court orders banning mining in the Aravalis.
 
 “What passes one’s comprehension and smacks of both political and bureaucratic complicity is that even though the local MP had pointed this out in a letter to the central and the state governments, precious little was done to stop it. Also, though 55 hectares (137.5 acres) of stone quarry was auctioned off, mining was undertaken in 224 acres, including 86 acres of the Aravali range,” Choudhry said.
 
 This has damaged ecology beyond repair and resulted in the seasonal ‘nullah’ spread over 1.5km in Dadam area being transformed into a pathway to facilitate movement of trucks to ferry out mined material. The pipeline that watered plants atop the hilltop was dismantled resulting in starved plants beginning to wither, she pointed out.
 
 “But for complicity of the powers that be it could not have been made possible. The chief minister should order a CBI inquiry into the matter to nail and punish those involved in this illegal activity,” Choudhry demanded.
