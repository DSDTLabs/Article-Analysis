CHHAPRA: Aggrieved Bachelor of Computer Application ( ) students of J P University, Chhapra, on Tuesday became violent over their poor results and attacked department co-coordinator Ravi Kant Shukla in the distance education block of the university alleging irregularities in evaluation of answer sheets. Only seven out of 127 students could pass in the 5th semester exam. 

 BCA course is available in about half a dozen JPU colleges through its distance education directorate. Shukla said, “About 10-12 agitated students approached me in my office and wanted to know the reasons behind the poor results. Before I could understand the problem, some of them threw ink over my shirt and some attacked me causing injury in my head.”
 
 The students alleged that the 3rd semester results had also been poor. Hearing the commotion, the security guards rushed to the distance education building and overpowered the agitating students. They were brought to the proctor’s office, but pleaded ignorance about the incident. When proctor Prof U S Yadav asked them to give in writing about their innocence, they refused. In the meantime, Chhapra Muffasil police also arrived and inquired about the incident. However, the proctor said action would be taken against the guilty students after going through the CCTV footage.
 
 Later, another group of BCA students and activists of the Research Students Organization met and requested pro-VC Prof A K Jha and controller of examinations (CE) Prof Anil Kumar Singh to review the results. They alleged large-scale irregularities in the evaluation of answer sheets and preparation of the results. Both the officials assured them to look into the matter and in case of no improvement, a supplementary examination would be arranged for them.
