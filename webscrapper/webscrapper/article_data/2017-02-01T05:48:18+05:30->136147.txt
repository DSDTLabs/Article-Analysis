KOLHAPUR:   corporator from Kasba Bawda ward   — a   — has been elected chairman of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s (KMC) on Tuesday. He defeated Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nominee Ashish Dhawale by 8 to 7 votes and will be the 40th person to hold the post.

 The post of standing committee chairman is considered important as major financial decisions are taken in it and the chairman presents the budget to the general body meeting after the municipal commissioner submits paper on the income and expenditure of the KMC.
 
 Rina Kamble of the Congress party had decided to vote for Dhawale. But she remained absent on the Election Day. Congress also received support from Shiv Sena and district collector Amit Saini declared Nejdar as the winner.
 
 The BJP and Tararani Aghadi leaders tried their best to ensure Sena remain absent during voting but that never happened. During the last standing committee chairman election, Sena had helped the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) nominee in winning the election.
 
 Recently former mayor Ashwini Ramane and corporator Nilesh Desai were disqualified for submitting false caste certificates. Nejdar’s caste documents are also under scrutiny with caste validation committee. If the caste documents are termed invalid then Nejdar will have to resign from the post.
 
 Meanwhile, NCP corporator from Buddh Garden ward Wahida Saoudagar was elected as chairman of KMC’s women and child welfare committee by defeating Tararani Aghadi's Archana Pagar 5 to 4 votes.
