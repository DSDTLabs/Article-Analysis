KOCHI: After a massive manhunt, late on Monday night police managed to nab one more accused in the alleged rape of a popular Malayalam actor. Police sources identified him as Manikandan. Two other suspects, including the main accused, continued to evade the police dragnet at the time of going to press, even as their la wyer filed a petition in the Kerala high court on Monday seeking anticipatory bail.

 The special investigation team probing the rape is now focussing on the possibility of 'Pulsar' Suni, the actor's former driver, having been hired to carry out the crime.
 
 According to an official with the SIT, the actor in her statement to the police said that 'Pulsar' Suni kept referring to `quotation' (meaning a criminal contract' in local underworld parlance). The actor was threatened with a drug-filled syringe before they sexually assaulted her. They told her that they were carrying out a quotation and if she didn't cooperate, she would be taken to a flat in   where a worse fate awaited her,“ an officer said.
 
 In the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, a police team came close to nabbing `Pulsar' Suni near Ambalappuzha. Though the cops managed to nab Anwar, Suni's aide, Suni himself managed to escape. The police had closed in on him using mobile tower loca tions. Suni has gone off the grid again, an SIT officer revealed.
 
 The Kerala women's commission on Monday registered a suo motu case in the alleged rape of the actor. Commission members Shiji Shivaji and Lisy Jose visited the actor and took her statement. The commission also sought a report from the DGP.
 
 Chief minister   and CPM state secretary   spoke to the actor on phone on Monday and offered her their unconditional support. “There will not be any shortcomings in the investigation and strict action will be taken against the accused,“ the CM reportedly told her.
