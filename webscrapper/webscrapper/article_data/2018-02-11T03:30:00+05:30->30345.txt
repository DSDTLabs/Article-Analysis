Guntur: In a bizarre incident, a man died of a cardiac arrest on Saturday after learning about the attempted suicide of his friend, whom he had lent a sum of Rs 5 lakh.

 The deceased was identified as Suryanarayana, a native of Sankurathripadu under Nadendla mandal. The debt-ridden farmer, Mamillapalli Nageswara Rao (48), was from the same village in Guntur district. Due to poor cotton yield, Nageswara Rao took loans from a number of financiers and took up cultivation in about 25 acres, though he owns only 2 acres of land.
 
 Reportedly, this was the third consecutive year Nageswara Rao lost money on commercial crops such as cotton, chilli and other crops. According to Nageswara Rao’s relatives, he may have debts anywhere between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 40 lakh.
 
 On Saturday morning, Nageswara Rao consumed pesticide at his home. His relatives rushed him to a private hospital in Narasaraopet. Hearing abput the news, Suryanarayana suffered a cardiac arrest. He died while he was being shifted to a hospital. He was a retired employee.
 
 Meanwhile, the cops said both the incidents were just coincidental and that Suryanarayana died because of existing health complications. Locals opined that the news of Nageswara Rao attempting suicide shocked Suryanarayana and aggravated his condition resulting in a cardiac arrest.
 
 Nadendla sub-inspector Kommalapati Chandra Sekhar said they have recorded a statement from Nageswara Rao’s son Srikanth on what happened. However, they are yet to book a case as Nageswara Rao was not in a position to give an official statement. His condition is said to be critical and he is presently being treated in Intensive Care Unit.
