CHANDIGARH: Former   chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday attacked incumbent Manohar Lal Khattar over latter’s claim of achievements while terming the 1,000 days of the BJP rules as ‘governance wasted’. Hooda said the Prakash Singh committee observations and 22 deaths in police action in Haryana during the Jat agitation had left the state in a poor light.

 Hooda said the per capita income (one of the parameters of a state’s growth and fiscal health) saw a decline over the past three years. Taking a dig over the issue of corruption, the former CM said online transfers of teachers had turned out to be major source of corruption now.
 
 “Let CM Khattar come out with a one such project that was started during his tenure and he inaugurated it on completion. Be it the metro in Gurugram and Faridabad, overbridge in Gurugram or any other project. All projects were started during the   regime. I am ready to debate over development projects on any platform,” he said, adding that the BJP government in Haryana had started taking false credit over the issue of Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. He said all cases and applications for early hearing and the Presidential reference were signed during the Congress regime.
 
 “The BJP government has just resorted to loot (robbery), jhoot (lie) and phoot (division) in the society. Initially, it was caste divide, then there was schism in the name of cows and so on. In reality, the CM’s staffer had dismantled a cowshed at his official residence where cows had been kept during our regime. For the government’s information, our people manage the biggest gaushala (cowshelter) in Rohtak. We never did politics over that.”
