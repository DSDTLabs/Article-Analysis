AHMEDABAD:   high court on Thursday refused to order a   probe into the Una dalit flogging incident on the grounds that it is not a ‘rarest of the rare’ incident and that the investigation by CID (crime) was satisfactory.

 A public interest litigation was last August, demanding CBI probe into the incident and widespread cow vigilantism, which is illegal. The petitioner, Kanti Chavda, demanded an inquiry by the central agency, to investigate if there was a common conspiracy among the Hindu fanatical organizations and the Una-based NGO Shri Sanathan Charitable Trust or other organizations working across India.
 
 The petitioner wanted the CBI to probe why such organizations are terrorizing particular castes and communities, and what the main agenda behind their illegal activities is. It was also to find out whether other police officials, apart from those arrested in one month’s time, were involved in the conspiracy.
 
 The bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice V M Pancholi dismissed the PIL because the Una dalit flogging incident of July 11, 2016 was not one of the “rarest of the rare” incidents that warrant a CBI probe. Such an investigation can be ordered only in rare and exceptional cases, where high officials are involved or those that police does not investigate in a proper manner.
 
 However, in this case, the   said that the state government formed a special investigation team which carried out the probe satisfactorily. Forty-three persons including police personnel were arrested and charged in this case. It is not proper to say that the investigation by Gujarat police was biased.
