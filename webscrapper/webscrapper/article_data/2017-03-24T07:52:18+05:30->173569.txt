KOLKATA: The   into the complaint by   -wife of deceased patient Sanjay Roy -has now established Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals had constituted a factfinding committee to ascertain if there was any negligence or excesses by its staffers. The committee had even recommended action against a billing department official.

 “The fact that such a committee came to a conclusion show there was an error on part of the officials. This is the reason we called all the three committee members and discussed their findings,“ said an IPS officer. The employee held responsible by the committee is likely to be questioned again in the presence of senior Apollo officials.
 
 Rubi had also alleged there was extortion by the hospital. The police claimed now that they have established the exact command structure at the hospital -Apollo V-P (HR) Karunakar T is helping the probe -they strongly believe even the hospital's highest command structure was kept in dark about developments in Kol kata where Roy's family was allegedly asked to furnish fixed deposits before seeking his transfer to SSKM Hospital.
 
 “We have now summoned three members of the highest body of Apollo dealing with bills in Kolkata -the tariff committee -who will explain to us the actual sequence of events. This is the committee that finally decides on discounts and rounding off the bills,“ explained an officer.
 
 This evidence is important for two specific purposes. One, the bills provided to Roy's family show a mismatch between official rates of certain tests and the ones charged.Two, discrepancy of Rs 1.24 lakh has been detected between the bills furnished by Apollo to the investigators and the actual amount Roy's family was charged. Sources said legal opinion is being sought if additional sections can be slapped with the main FIR.
