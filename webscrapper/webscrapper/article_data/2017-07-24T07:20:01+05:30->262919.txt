LUCKNOW: For this   from Lucknow, and for his varied mango varieties, admiration has come from none other than the Prime Minister himself. 

 SC Shukla, who has grown several mango varieties in his orchards, including desi, hybrid and popular mangoes, had visited the PMO on July 15 to gift 21 mango varieties to PM  .
 
 “Though I could not meet the PM, his office accepted my gift on his behalf,” he said. 
 
 Two days later, on July 17, Shukla received a letter from the PM to congratulate him for developing and   of mangoes. The letter also thanked him for the gift—a basket full of mangoes.
 
 The letter further said that his efforts would encourage others in the field to take up experiments. The letter signed by the PM wished him luck for his future efforts. 
 
 “I received a call from the secretary at PMO saying that the PM tasted each of the mangoes and said he could not tell which one was the tastiest, as all of them were equally good,” said Shukla.
 
 He added he had been called by the PMO again. “I have already decided which mangoes to take this time,” said Shukla.
