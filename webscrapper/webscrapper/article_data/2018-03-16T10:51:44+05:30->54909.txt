HYDERABAD: Disruptions in the services of the budget carrier   continued on Thursday, with at least 14 flights to and from Hyderabad being cancelled for the day. While some of them, sources said, were suspended owing to ‘operational’ issues, most of the other cancellations were a result of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s ( ) recent move to ground eight IndiGo A320neo planes. The aircraft fleet, the regulatory body had observed, had defective engines not fit for use.

 But even as the airline operator, since the  , has maintained that the percentage of cancellations is limitedto a small number, those in the know of things said that several routes have been adversely affected over the last few days.
 
 A quick scan of the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport’s (RGIA) arrival/departure listings for Thursday, showed that IndiGo had cancelled flights to and from destinations such as New Delhi, Kolkata, Varanasi, Goa, Bhubaneshwar, Raipur, Coimbatore and Nagpur. “The airline has been flying its A320neo on many of these routes. So, while a couple of the cancellations could have been for other reasons, majority of them occurred because of flights being grounded,” said a source ruing the lack of clarity over when the services will be regularised again.
 
 Apart from being inconvenienced by the sudden cancellations, passengers pre-booked withIndiGo, alsocomplainedof incessant rescheduling that the airline has been resorting to of late. “I am scheduled to travel to Kolkata on Friday. On Thursday, I received a call from the airline staffer who told me that the timing of my flight has been changed. This is the third time they have rescheduled the same flight in the last two days,” said a flier from the city.
 
 Apart from Indigo, the DGCA also grounded three aircraft belonging to GoAir.
