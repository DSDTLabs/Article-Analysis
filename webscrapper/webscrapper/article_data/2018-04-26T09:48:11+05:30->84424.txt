CHENNAI: Pedestrians near the busy Anand Theatre junction are in a fix as two subways along the busy   have been demolished which will be reconstructed only following the   work.

 A month ago, the Church Park subway near the US consulate was closed for undertaking the work.   users and pedestrians are the most-affected lot, as the subway near Thousand Lights, too, was demolished and now pedestrians have to walk all the way till the Anand Theatre signal to cross the road. “It is impossible to cross the road without walking a long distance, thanks to medians and heavy traffic. How are we supposed to reach the other side?” asks P Kamala, who walked down to the Anand Theatre bus stop as she did not know how to cross and reach Whites Road.
 
 Those unfamiliar with the traffic set-up at the Anand Theatre signal are not aware that beyond the signal it is one-way. Familiar users, however, cross at the signal near the theatre.
 
 According to Metro Rail officials, the work will take two more months before the subways are rebuilt like the Simpsons subway. A highways official says that only the one near Simpsons is maintained well and frequently used and that Metro Rail should ensure that the subway is built in a manner that it remains usable and well-lit through the day and night. What irks pedestrians even more is the lack of pedestrian path on the one-way road after Spencers. “There used to be a temporary path with railings for pedestrian movement. Now, that itself has been blocked by the workers,” says S Dharshini, a bus commuter, who walked from the Anna Salai post office to the regional passport office amid fear of being hit by oncoming vehicles.
