HYDERABAD: Hyderabad and Bengaluru, India’s leading tech hubs, grabbed the top two spots in a list of 30 global cities that have shown most rapid ‘short-term’ growth, published by a real estate consulting firm.

 The ‘CMI Short-Term Momentum rankings’ published by   ( ), identifies urban economies and real estate markets which are currently undergoing the most rapid growth.
 
 Pune and Kolkata stood fourth and fifth respectively while the country’s Tier 1cities Delhi (8th), Chennai (14th) and Mumbai (20th) also found aplace in the list—with the take-up volumes and investor demand driven by technology, finance and pharmaceutical companies.
 
 According to the report, while short-term growth of cities is led by economic progress, there are several challenges that cities such as Hyderabad face when it comes to sustaining growth.
 
 “While economic energy is propelling Indian cities forward, they also exemplify some challenges facing markets with strong momentum, including strains on infrastructure and local amenities; high levels of inequality and affordability issues; and environmental degradation, which can all be compounded by a lack of planning oversight and transparency. To maintain their growth, cities need to focus on future-proofing markets through improved liveability and affordability, regulatory transparency and physical and technological infrastructure,” says the report.
 
 According to JLL, the Asia Pacific region accounted for 25 out of the 30 global cities listed while Indian cities dominated the ‘short term momentum ranking’ in JLL’s latest annual global report ‘City Momentum Index’ (CMI) 2018.
