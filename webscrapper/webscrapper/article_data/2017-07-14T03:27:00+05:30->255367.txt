Mapusa: In its attempts to make areas within its jurisdiction open defecation free, the   Municipal Council (MMC) recently conducted a survey to identify places where residents still lack access to proper toilets. 

 The civic body plans to provide 100 bio-toilets to households without toilets and have decided to declare some wards open defecation free.
 
 MMC chairperson Rohan Kavlekar said the government, under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, had asked the civic body to make its jurisdiction open defecation free, following which all councillors were asked for their views on the issue. A survey was conducted in all the wards and a list prepared of open defecation-free areas. Households were also checked for access to toilet facilities. 
 
 “In some areas where migrants or tenants are staying, there are issues of open defecation. MMC is arranging for about 100 bio-toilets to be provided to the public to bring the problem under control,” Kavlekar said.
 
 The MMC, in its ordinary council meeting on June 2, had resolved to declare eight wards — 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 19 — of the 20 under its administration as open defecation free. The civic body had also asked the public to submit their feedback or objections on the decision, if any, to the office of the municipality in 15 days.
