JAIPUR: Former Union minister Bhanwar  , while referring to the controversial film ‘Padmaavat’ on Monday, said   never supported distortion of history in any manner. The Congress leader said that what has happened to the Rajputs may not remain limited to just one community.

 “No one, be it the Rajasthan government or the central government, has the right to distort our history and present it in a wrong manner. Today this has happened with the Kshatriya (Rajput) samaj but it is not limited just to the Kshatriya samaj. Every samaj has some ‘aadarsh’ (values) that it protects,” said Singh, while speaking to reporters at Shree Rajput Sabha Bhawan here.
 
 The leader, who belongs to erstwhile Alwar royal family, was here to thank the Rajput, Ravana Rajput and Charan Rajput organisations that announced support to Congress in the bypolls for Alwar and Ajmer   and Mandalgarh ( )   constituencies. 
 
 The Congress leader claimed that the support extended by three communities’ organisations has shifted BJP’s vote bank in all three constituencies going to bypolls on January 29. He said ‘injustices inflicted on Rajputs by BJP’ will be accounted for once Congress returned to power.
 
 Singh blamed the   and its governments at Centre and in states for the law and order getting disturbed due to prevailing controversy over the film ‘Padmaavat’. “For the current controversy and threats to law and order, the complete responsibility rests with the BJP and its governments,” said Singh.
 
 The former minister said the government should put in place a mechanism to check distortion of history through films. “I had demanded from the government that a policy be adopted that whenever such a film is made, its script should be put before historians and people concerned to ensure that our history is not tempered with,” said Singh.
