Guwahati: With three one-horned rhinos brought in on Friday, their total population at   (MNP) has now increased to 34. The female calves were transferred from the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC), a wildlife rescue, care and rehabilitation facility at Bokakhat, jointly run by   (WTI), the International Fund for Animal Welfare ( ) and the forest department. 

 These rhinos had been first rescued during floods at the Kaziranga National Park in 2016 and subsequently raised at the CWRC. Manas field director HK   said the rhinos will be formally released into the national park on Saturday and they will be initially kept in a pre-release facility so that they adapt to their new home. 
 
 Manas, a world heritage site, lost all its 100-odd rhinos in the 1990s during the height of insurgency movement in the present Bodoland Territorial Area District. Following large-scale poaching and destruction of park infrastructure during the insurgency movement,   listed Manas in their world heritage site in danger category in 1992. However, due to persistent conservation efforts and addition of more rhinos under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020, the park got back its world heritage site status in 2011.
 
 18 rhinos have been transferred to Manas from Kaziranga National Park and Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary since 2008, while 11 rescued rhinos have been rehabilitated from CWRC since 2006. Sarma said some of the rhinos have also given birth at Manas, with four new births recorded between September and December last year.
 
 However, the park also suffered due to poaching, losing at least 10 rhinos since 2011, prompting the park authorities to revitalize their anti-poaching drive. "Along with habitat improvements for rhinos, we are also strengthening our anti-poaching mechanism," Sarma added.
