  , the actress popular for playing Ratanjeet in the TV soap Ek Veer Ardaas...Veera, was very excited on Ki her recent visit to Lucknow and Kanpur. The actor, who was in the UP capital to promote her latest show Sher E Punjab ­  , told us, “Jis hisaab se humlog ko promotions ke liye yahan channel wale le ke aatey hain, we get to know that UP is the hub of television. Maximum TRP and visual rating comes from UP , so the only connect I have with the state is television.That's why I feel that UP mein agar logon ne television nahi dekha, toh kisi ne nahi dekha,“ said Sneha.
 
  
 
  
  A divorcee, Sneha takes it in her stride, that her personal life is more talked about than her professional life.“It doesn't matter. My past has never affected my career. I am not open to having a relationship now. One thing that I have learnt in my life is that a man doesn't complete your life. There are more important things in life than falling in love and wasting your emotions on a person,“ she said. Sneha, who pursued her film making course from London, says that she will start directing when she stops acting in television.The actor said, “I want to dedicate my heart and soul into this. In future, when I don't wish to act, then I would like to switch to direction.“
