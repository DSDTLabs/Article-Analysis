Trichy: Bharathidasan University has decided to implement provisions of the employees provident fund act for guest faculty recruited on temporary basis in its constituent and model colleges.

 Close to 400 temporary teaching faculty apart from several non-teaching staff who were so far only getting consolidated pay will benefit from the move. 
 
 While it is mandatory for any organisation with over 30 employees to have employee provident fund,.the BDU administration failed to do implement it all these years. 
 
 The move has been termed landmark by the guest faculty members as many among them have been working for over 12 years now. The move is also seen as recognition for temporary faculty seeking permanent employment later. Guest faculty members are recruited every year, for a period of one year, by the university to its constituent college based on the requirements and relieved during the summer vacation. This practice is to ensure that the guest faculty working in these colleges for over a decade do not approach the court seeking permanent employment. 
 
 “EPF deductions is proof of our work in the institution. Thus it would certainly help us seek permanent employment in the long run,” said another guest faculty member from Perambalur. Speaking to TOI over phone, vice-chancellor P Manisankar said that the university was only implementing the order by the employee provident fund office.
