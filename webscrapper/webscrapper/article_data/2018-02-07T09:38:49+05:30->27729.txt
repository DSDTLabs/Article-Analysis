JAIPUR:   (RUAA) has raised objection to the government's approval for appointment into 149 teaching posts which has no mention of hiring for self-finance courses. 

 Former IAS and head of alumni association Satya Narayan Singh said that RU runs self-finance courses, including CCT, BBA,  , five-year-integrated LLM along with M.Tech and MBA executive programme, which have either no permanent teachers or way less than required.
 
 RUAA's PIL is pending in the Rajasthan High Court on state government's rule of not granting permission to state varsities hiring teachers for  . In the PIL, the body has contended that involvement of university teachers from other departments' tantamount to violation of   rules.
 
 The approval of teachers with none for SFC came as a shocker for the alumni association. "Many of these courses have no trained faculty since inception of the course. The BCA and MCA courses are running for more than two decades, without any faculty member," said Singh.
 
 He also raised the point that in SFC courses, students pay the entire sum but they are getting nothing, which is not less than a harassment of these students. The enrollment of these courses is fast declining also.
 
 The alumni members include former and present IAS, IPS and academicians. They have been active since the university professors named came up in paper leak scandal. They are monitoring each and every development of the university claiming that they have a role to play in the university.
 
 Universities cannot recruitment teachers unless they get the permission from the state. State argues that SFC courses are seen as temporary courses and faculties hired for these courses would add the additional burden on them.
