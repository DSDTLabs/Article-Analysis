NEW DELHI: A businessman was waylaid by two men on a motorcycle and   in east   while he was returning home on Sunday. The family said the motive was robbery as he was supposed to be carrying a bag with Rs 3 lakh cash. Police, however, have found his mobile phone and some money in his pocket. 

 The victim, Vineet Kumar Jain (38), owned a shop selling threads and clothes. Around 10.30pm, he called his wife saying he was on his way home in Krishna Nagar. His family told the police that he usually took a shortcut through lane number 4 in Raghubarpura. The area usually remains dark.
 
 When Jain slowed down at a turn, two bikers signalled him to stop. After a minor argument one of them pulled out a pistol and shot Jain in the chest. 
 
 Eyewitnesses said the youths fled through a dark lane. Hearing gunshots, locals rushed Jain to a local hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.
 
 Jain owned the shop in partnership with his younger brothers, Ashok and Vivek.
 
 They are two CCTVs installed outside a house near the crime spot, but they were found defunct by the police. The possibility of murder due to an old rivalry has not been ruled out.
