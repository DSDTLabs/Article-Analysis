DABOLIM:   has informed   (AAI) of its intention to close Goa International Airport’s lone runway for maintenance every Saturday and Sunday morning. The move has alarmed   (TTAG), who, on Monday, urged Union aviation minister Suresh Prabhu to resolve the issue ahead of the next tourism season.

 “Most of the charter flights land on Saturday and Sunday. Now the Navy is thinking of closing the runway on Saturday and Sunday,” TTAG president Savio Messias said. AAI official and director of   Bhupesh Negi confirmed the development but asserted that no decision had been taken.
 
  Indian Navy officials stated that for safety reasons, the runway had to be closed for maintenance activity for a few hours every work.
 
 Messias had brought the issue up during a review meeting chaired by Union minister for civil aviation Suresh Prabhu. “We will try to find a solution after talking to the Navy. It will be taken up on priority,” Prabhu said.
