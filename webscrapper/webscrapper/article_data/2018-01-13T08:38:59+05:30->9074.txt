AHMEDABAD: Of the 31 satellites launched by Isro’s workhorse, the Polar   Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C40, on Friday, was a microsatellite developed by the Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad. The microsat will be a game changer for Isro, India’s space agency. It left the SAC campus on January 3 for launch and has a payload that can capture images in a far infrared spectrum — which means it can capture images in poor light conditions. “This is a new technology indigenously developed by Isro-SAC and other centres, where image is captured in the far infrared spectrum,” says a senior   official.

 The microsat is a technology demonstrator for Isro. “We are looking towards miniaturization of satellites so they take up less volume, require less power and work efficiently. Microsats work with high efficiency in remote sensing and can be useful in monitoring natural disasters as well,” a senior Isro official said.
 
 Earlier, minister of state for atomic energy and space,  , said that Isro is working on a design for a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV). The launch vehicle, he claimed, will be a compact launcher for small satellites.
