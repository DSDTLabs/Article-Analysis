CHIKKAMAGALURU:   of the district arrested a man for allegedly poisoning his brother and sister-in-law over a property dispute and trying to make it look a suicide.

 On Jaunary 12, Venkatesh, 45, and Rukmini, 40, both residents of Kanachuru village had consumed ragi ambali (millet beverage) and fallen violently ill. But information they shared just before their death helped cops confirm that Venkatesh’s brother Dinesh had mixed rat   in the beverage. They nabbed him and sent him to judicial custody. The couple has two minor children.
 
 Venkatesh and Rukmini were rushed to a private hospital in Chikkamagaluru where doctors had suspected foul play and alerted Gonibeedu police. As their condition deteriorated, their relatives rushed them to Manipal for treatment. While Venkatesh died on Saturday, his wife passed away on Sunday. In their dying statements, they told police they had consumed ragi ambali and informed them about a property dispute with Dinesh.
 
 Police found inconsistencies in Dinesh’s statements and investigation revealed that he had mixed rat poison in the beverage.
 
 Venkatesh and Dinesh had divided their ancestral property of around 10 acres four years ago. Dinesh had been quarrelling with his brother, seeking a bigger share. Dinesh had sent his wife and mother out of the house over a trivial issue and stayed alone.
 
 "The kitchen of Venkatesh’s house is located outside and doesn’t have a permanent wall but built of fronds. On January 12, Rukmini had prepared ragi ambali after lunch and kept it in the kitchen. They left the house for some work. Dinesh entered the kitchen and mixed rat poison in the beverage. The unsuspecting couple drank it and fell ill,” police said. 
 
 "Dinesh has confessed to the crime," police said.
