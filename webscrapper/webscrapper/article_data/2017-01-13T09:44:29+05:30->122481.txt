AMARAVATI: In what could be a big relief for thirsty Chennai, AP government in principle has agreed to   the Tamil Nadu capital. Chief minister N   has assured Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneer Selvam to take all possible measures to cooperate with the neighbouring state. 

 Although, Naidu is said to have agreed to release about 2.5 tmcft of water to Chenai, the detailed modalities for the release of water from AP dams will be worked out at officials' meet to be held at Tirupati next week.
 
 With AP government not responding to his SOS through mail, Panneer Selvam arrived here on Thursday to request immediate release of water. Armed with a battery of officials, including chief secretary Girija Vaidyanathan and adviser Sheela Balakrishnan, Selvam reached AP secretariat at Velagapudi around 3.30pm. 
 
 Initially, both the chief ministers held discussions about the possibility of releasing water. A little later, senior officials and ministers from both the sides joined the negotiations. 
 
 While Kandaleru reservoir has about 12 tmc of water, Somasila project has another 39 tmc. Taking both the reserves into account, TN wanted the AP to release at least four tmcs.
