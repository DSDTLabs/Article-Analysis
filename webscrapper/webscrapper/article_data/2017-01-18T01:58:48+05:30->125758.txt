MUMBAI: A day after a 22-year-old Dombivali woman got the Supreme Court’s nod to abort her 24-week-old foetus with a brain deformity, she was admitted to   Hospital in Parel on Tuesday. She is likely to undergo the medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) on Wednesday under a medical panel’s the observation .

 “We came to the   around 3pm. She was made to undergo certain tests. The doctors have told us that they will induce labour to deliver the foetus. We hope to go home in two-three days,” said Santosh Pal, the woman’s husband. He said they would have preferred to visit a private hospital closer to their Dombivali house but will respect the court’s order and complete the procedure in KEM. KEM Dean Dr Avinash Supe said that the procedure would be carried out on Wednesday.
