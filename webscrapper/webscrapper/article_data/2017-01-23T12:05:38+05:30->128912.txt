NAGPUR: Dr   (Wahane), the dean of   and Hospital (IGMCH) was finally suspended from her job on Saturday afternoon.

 She was served with the suspension notice personally at her residence by a hand courier sent to her by Dr A V Shrikhande, the acting dean of the college.
 
 Dr Shrikhande told TOI that she received the suspension order from the   (DMER) early in the morning. “I also spoke to Dr Gajbhiye on the phone,” Dr Shrikhande said.
 
 The suspension order was signed late Friday night by chief minister   and reached the DMER at around 10pm. DMER chief Dr Pravin Shingare told TOI that the suspension will be followed by a departmental enquiry soon. A high-level committee will be constituted by the state government which will enquire into the issue in depth.
 
 Breaking her silence on the issue, Dr Gajbhiye told TOI that she was completely innocent and was purposefully dragged in a controversy. She said she performed her duty with all sincerity and honesty. “The CCTV was not working from January 8. I did not tamper with it. I am being falsely dragged into this for nothing,” she said.
