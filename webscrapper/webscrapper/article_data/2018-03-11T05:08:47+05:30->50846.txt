MUMBAI: Controversial former CM   on Saturday accepted BJP president Amit Shah’s offer to contest the ensuing Rajya Sabha elections. “I am contesting the Rajya Sabha elections. I will file my nomination papers on Monday, but I am yet to decide on whether I will contest as a BJP nominee or independent candidate. A decision will be taken after consulting the CM,’’ Rane told TOI.

 Rane’s decision is being viewed as a major relief for CM Devendra Fadnavis. Ever since Rane expressed his desire to join the state cabinet, Fadnavis had expressed reservations to the BJP brass, saying he would not be comfortable with his presence.
 
 After the defeat of his son Neelesh in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, followed by his own defeat in the assembly elections as well as   by-election, Rane was planning to quit the Congress. In a pre-emptive move, state Congress chief   dissolved the Ranecontrolled Sindhudurg Congress Committee; as a result, he had no option but to quit the Congress.
 
 Then Rane had a series of meetings with  , Fadnavis and state BJP chief   on his induction in the state cabinet. At one stage, Shah accepted Rane’s proposal, but it was abandoned after Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray made it known that if Rane is inducted into the state cabinet, the Sena will withdraw from the government. So, Rane was asked to float his own party and extend support to the  . Accordingly, Rane set up the   and he was expecting a cabinet berth. However, the CM dropped the idea in view of strong opposition from Shiv Sena.
 
 A senior BJP cabinet member said that at this juncture, when both Lok Sabha and assembly polls are around, the BJP leadership will not take any decision that will destabilise both the central and state government. “`If the Sena withdraws support, we are not sure if our government will survive or otherwise. We do not want to take any risk,” he said.
