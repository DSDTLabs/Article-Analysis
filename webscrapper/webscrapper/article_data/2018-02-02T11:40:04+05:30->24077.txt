MADURAI:   has been completely ignored in the   by the Union finance minister  , the founder of the All India Muvendar Munnani Kazhagam Dr N Sethuraman has said.

 According to a press release, he has said that this budget was just a one with numerous announcements without any focus on development. It was expected that Tamil Nadu government, which was in a cash crunch situation, would be given relief from the central government. Instead the state government has been viewed in a step mother way and nothing has been done to help its financial crisis.
 
 The central governmentâ€™s budget has shown that the people of Tamil Nadu should explore ways to develop the state, without depending on the Centre. As the rural sector has been given importance it shows that the finance minister has taken into account the failing popularity of the Modi government among the rural folk. All announcements like housing for all by 2022, Rs 11 lakh crore for agriculture, Rs 10,000 crore for fisheries, Rs 4 crore for free electricity for the poor have all been made with an eye on the rural vote bank.
 
 Announcing that the agriculture sector given priority was just an eye wash, he said that no announcement have been made about linking of rivers, which was important to meet the water requirement of the agriculture sector throughout the country.
 
 Some of the welcoming features of the budget were the setting up of one lakh health centres, training for 50 lakh youths with incentives, increasing maternity leave period for women, additional allotment for the textile sector. But, the importance given to  , keeping in mind the ensuing elections, was not given to Tamil Nadu, he said.
