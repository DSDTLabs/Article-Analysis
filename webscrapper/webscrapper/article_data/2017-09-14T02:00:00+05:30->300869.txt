GAYA: Uncertain future haunts nearly 200 students of Central University of South Bihar ( ) of the integrated BEd course for sessions 2013-17 and 2014-18 as the written undertaking given by the registrar,  , to ensure retrospective (National Council For Teachers Education) NCTE approval for the course by the end of July 2017, has gone for a toss. 

 The university admitted students without the mandatory approval of the NCTE, the apex body for teachers’ education courses. The written undertaking was given by the registrar on April 22, 2017 to meet the condition set by fasting CUSB students to end the hunger strike.
 
 Disappointed by the university's failure to provide relief to the students who studied for four long years only to know at the last moment that they would not be getting degrees as the course they pursued did not have the mandatory NCTE approval, angry students, on Tuesday held university officials hostage . The officials were subsequently rescued by the police.
 
 The existing law does not permit retrospective approval and the Act governing the BEd colleges has to be amended either through Parliamentary legislation or ordinance to allow retrospective affiliation to CUSB to legitimise the BEd course for the session 2013-17 and 2014-18.
 
 CUSB has got NCTE approval for sessions 2015-19 onwards. Getting the Union cabinet nod to undo a wrong committed at the university level is said to be extremely difficult if not impossible, more so on account of the no nonsense approach of PM  .
 
 The registrar too refused to answer queries on the issue and said that a Press release would be issued later on.
 
 Prof  , department of education and CUSB proctor said, “The Union HRD ministry was working on the issuance of an ordinance to provide relief to the students and it is a time taking exercise.”
