NAGPUR: Around 20   (English) third semester students on Friday approached the   crying foul over evaluation of one of the papers. However, the students were unable to meet the   and hand over their complaint. Later, they were told to come on Saturday.

 In their complaint to the vice chancellor, the students claimed that most of them had failed in the subject ‘20th Century Amercian Literature’. “While our scores in other subjects have been well above average, the marks in this particular exam suggest serious negligence in evaluation,” they said.
 
 The results were declared on January 19. This year’s MA (English) third semester has abysmally dropped by 9%. The pass percentage is just 23% while it was 32% in 2016. Over 500 students from different colleges affiliated to NU had appeared for the exam.
 
 The aggrieved students have appealed to the NU to expedite the process to help them save a crucial academic year.
 
 “We have applied for revaluation according to procedure, but the process itself takes time, compelling us to appear for this paper in the next semester as well. This additional subject load in a crucial (final) semester in not conducive to our performance. It’s our sincere request to you to probe into this matter and make the answersheet copies available for scrutiny at the earliest,” they said.
 
 Earlier the university used to issue photocopies in such cases. After passing a new ordinance, the university has stopped issuing the same and students need to directly challenge the evaluation within 10 days of results.
 
 “As evident from earlier cases, the revaluation result won’t be declared anytime soon. We are planning to take the   route to get the photocopies of our answer books,” the students told TOI.
