 The arrested men have been identified as M Burhaan, 30, R Ameen, 34, and S Syed, 37, all hailing from Bengaluru. DRI sleuths apprehended the trio while smuggling tortoises in a car from Karnataka. According to those arrested,  , 57, a godown owner of Cauvery Nagar in Pudukkottai, had sourced tortoises from various places and asked them to take them to Rameswaram.
 
 A godown near Rengammal chatram along Trichy- Karikudi national highway was under DRI’s close watch for the past few days. On Thursday morning, the trio came on a Karnataka-registered car to the godown. However, by noon, a total of 40 sleuths of DRI in six cars entered the godown and took them into custody. Search is on for three more people, including the godown owner, near Pudukkottai bus stand.
 
 While a senior DRI official estimated the star tortoises’ worth to be over Rs 16 crore, Divisional Forest Officer Pudukkottai M Anand Kumar said that the value would vary from country to country.
 
 “The idea was to traffic these tortoises to Sri Lanka and from there to China and other South East Asian countries where there is a good demand for star tortoises,” said a DRI official.
 
 Star tortoise is mostly found in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh as well as Sri Lanka. The reptiles are protected under Schedule 4 of the Wildlife protection act 1972. Usually, they are used as pet animals in China and South East Asian countries for the unique colour pattern on its shell, he said.
 
 The DRI sleuths handed over the tortoises to the forest department. The DFO said that they would be letting these tortoises into the forest. However, the decision on the forest in which they will be released would be decided after consultation with higher officials, said the DFO.
