Panaji: Realising that the citizens are facing hardships at the sub-registrar’s office in Margao, with the old birth and death certificates shifted to the archives’ office at Altinho, Panaji, the state government on Wednesday directed the department of registration to maintain status quo until digitization of records is done

 Recently, the chief registrar of births and deaths issued an order to temporarily shift the birth and death records of pre-1970 period to the archives office at Altinho, Panaji. This was to facilitate the process of completing digitization of the old records as some corrections had to be made, an official source said. 
 
 In the last few days, citizens had been visiting the sub-registrar’s office in Margao only to be told that they have to travel to Panaji to obtain the old certificates. “Some people approached me saying that when they went to collect the certificate, they were told that the records are being shifted to Panaji. They were issued a receipt on payment and told to come after a month. Accordingly, they went to collect the certificates, but were in for a rude shock,” said convener of NGO Goa for Goans, Kennedy Afonso.
 
 Citizens complained to the sub-registrar and requested him to reconsider the decision. He told them that he was acting as per the decision of the government. Afonso said that the government should have followed a process and cleared the backlog first before going ahead with the decision. “Hold on to the decision till the backlog is cleared,” he suggested.
 
 For various purposes, including for application for Portuguese passport, several citizens have been approaching the office of sub-registrar for the certificates of their parents. On Wednesday, TCP minister Vijai Sardesai took up the issue with chief minister Manohar Parrikar. “The CM has agreed to the request”, Sardesai told TOI.
