Chairman,  , Prabhat Kumar also released a schedule for possession of 10,500 plots and another 5,100 flats allotted in 2009.

The first lot of 3,055 allottees have already been issued possession letters by the Authority in January and February. By the end of June, we will hand over possession to 416 allottees. Thereafter, by November 30, another 1,437 plots will be handed over and 8,156 plots in another month,” said Kumar. 
 
 “We have also given an offer to plot owners to return half of their land to YEIDA. There are 123 people who have been allotted 4,000 sq meters, 292 people who have been given 2,000 sqm of plot, 1,219 who have been allotted 1,000 sqm of land,” he said.
