 While passengers took to Twitter expressing their grievances, airlines also tweeted that the situation was out of their control. Apologising for the inconvenience,   said, “We would like to inform you that Delhi airport has been facing challenges with the baggage handling system post check-in. All airlines and hundreds of bags have been impacted and not being loaded onto flights.” The airlines have taken this up with Delhi airport officials, who are looking into the matter, it added. 
 
 Actress and BJP MP Hema Malini and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav were among the affected passengers.
 
 Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said the problem was primarily triggered by a high number of checked-in baggages with prohibited items such as power banks and lighters. 
 
 With the onset of the holiday weekend, “the incident rate (on Thursday) was 30% higher than an average day,” a DIAL spokesperson said. This requires “manual reconciliation of the suspect baggage with the passenger and removal of the prohibited item”. Passengers are being reminded not to pack any prohibited item in their checked-in luggage and the issue is now under control,” he added.
 
 On March 22, a Hyderabad-bound Vistara aircraft had to return to T3 after taxiing out after a passenger belatedly remembered that his checked-in luggage had a power bank. 
 
 Items like power banks, e-cigarettes and loose lithium batteries are prohibited in the checked-in luggage due to chances of them catching fire in the baggage hold.
