Hyderabad: A dance master was booked by the Raidurgam police on Saturday for allegedly outraging the modesty of a 14-year-old girl who was training under him for the past several months. 

 Raidurgam police said K Venkata Krishna Kishore, a dance master-cum-actor, would take classes at his residence at Chitrapuri colony. The victim, a class 7 student from his neighbourhood, was training under him for quite some time. 
 
 A few days ago, Kishore suddenly held the victim’s hand and asked her to marry him. He also misbehaved with her. On Friday night, he went to the victim’s residence and started pestering her to marry him. 
 
 “At one point of time, Kishore attempted to kidnap the victim from her house. But the girl’s mother raised an alarm. The victim’s father, who was just outside their house, thwarted Kishore’s bid to kidnap the girl,’’ Raidurgam inspector K Durga Prasad told TOI. 
 
 The culprit then picked up a rod lying nearby and attacked the victim’s father before fleeing. The girl then narrated the earlier episodes of harassment too, after which her parents approached Raidurgam police. 
 
 Police registered a case under sections 354 (Assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences ( ) Act. Police claimed Kishore is still at large and efforts are being made to arrest him.
