CHANDIGARH: The smart   lots of sectors 8,9,17,35 have been lying littered with dry leaves and   even though the commuters using the lots are charged Rs 10 for their maintenance.

 During a visit to the various parking lots in Sectors 8, 9, 17 and 35, dry leaves in the parking area of two- wheelers and four-wheelers welcomed us. Professor   who visited the Sector 17 plaza said that the pride of Chandigarh which is Sector 17 has a ‘brand new look:’ It is a pheriwalas’ den full of filthiest corners and stinking toilets. He said he visited the market in the afternoon and the garbage was lying in the   meant for four-wheelers in the area.
 
 But the question is: When the parking lot is opened at 11 am, why doesn’t the contractor get the parking lots cleaned before that? R L  , who visited the Sector 8 parking lot, said these days dry leaves are falling off and the corporation sweepers are allowing heaps to develop in the morning and later in the day the trolleys remove them.
