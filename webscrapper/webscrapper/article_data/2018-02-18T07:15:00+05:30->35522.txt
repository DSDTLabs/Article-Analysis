GREATER NOIDA: A member of the state working committee of BJP’s NGO cell has alleged that he has been receiving ransom calls on behalf of dreaded gangster  , who is currently lodged in a jail in Haryana. 

 Thakur Pushkar Singh, who stays in Informatics Society in Sector Pi I of Greater Noida has claimed that he has been receiving calls from an unknown number in which a person identifying himself as “Khan” is addressing himself as known to gangster Mukim Kala. “I first received a call last week when the person on the other side demanded Rs 50 lakh from me. 
 
 On that day, he did not mention Kala and I ignored the call. However, at 10.45 am on Friday, I received a call from 9896144630 when that person said that he was close to Mukim Kala and I should arrange for a sum of Rs 50 lakh and started abusing me issuing a death threat,” Singh had complained.He told TOI that at 9.39 am on Saturday, he again received a call from the same number and the person repeated the ransom demand and abuses. He has said that his family is in fear due to the calls. The police, is however, probing the angle of personal enmity in the case too. Singh holds a real estate business in Greater Noida with another partner.
 
 Kala who is currently lodged in a Haryana jail, has been known for unleashing a reign of terror in Shamli and nearby districts by demanding ransom and also killing people. Kasna SHO Brijesh Verma said that the police has lodged an FIR.
