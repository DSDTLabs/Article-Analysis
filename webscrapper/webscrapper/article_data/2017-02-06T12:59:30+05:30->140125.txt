 who last sung in 2013, for her acting debut, 'Mai', has now recorded the introductory song, ' ', for National Award winning Bengali director,  's   debut, ' '. The period drama, which unfolds soon after the Partition, revolves around a brothel and the LOC.  , who plays the madam of a brothel, sings the song in the film. Srijit told Mirror, "Composer Anu Malik and I were discussing how to capture the essence of a mujra. Vidya's 'Begum Jaan' is a tawaif from Lucknow and we wanted a voice that'd bring back the nostalgia of ' '. We wanted Ashaji but weren't sure if she'd agree as she hasn't sung in a long time."

  
  
 The deadline was looming large when the veteran singer dropped by to visit Anu, who was in the hospital at the time for a gall bladder issue.
 
 "When she left, I wanted to work with her again and spoke to Srijit who jumped at the idea. I started composing the tune right away in the ICU and pitched it to Ashaji who rehearsed with me for three hours at home before we recorded it. Once it was done, she told me the song would mark a comeback for Asha Bhosle to which I pointed out that Asha Bhosle had never gone anywhere," Anu smiles.
 
 After she left the studio, Srijit wanted one line re-dubbed and all hell broke loose because you can't call a singer of Ashaji's stature again after she'd given four hours for the recording besides the rehearsals. "But Srijit is a perfectionist so I had to call her," says Anu, remembering it was her son Nandu's birthday and she informed that it wouldn't be possible for her to return that day. "I requested her to come for 15 minutes at the next morning. She'd have to drive down from town to Andheri and initially refused. But then she suddenly agreed. It's just perfect," Anu signs off.
