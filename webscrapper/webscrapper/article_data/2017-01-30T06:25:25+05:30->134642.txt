HYDERABAD: A proposal for the construction of villas for top IAS officers at Panjagutta has been hit by the Centre's demonetisation move. While a plea made by the roads & buildings (R&B) department seeking financial clearance for the villas has been lying with the finance department for the past four months, sources say, demonetisation may further delay plans.

 Sixty-five residential quarters meant for IAS, IPS and other senior bureaucrats were pulled down three months ago for the construction of 13 villas for top brass including the chief secretary , director general of police, director general,  , Hyderabad police commissioner, chief minister's office  , chief minister's office secretaries, state intelligence chief, chief minister's security officer and other senior bureaucrats.
 
 A city-based firm,  , which built the Chief Minister new camp office-cum-residence in six months, was also allotted the task of designing proposed villas by the R&B department.“Designs have been prepared keeping the greenery in mind.The existing roads in   may not be changed. The estimate to construct these villas is `33 crore.The designs were also shwon to Chief Minister  , but are yet to finalised,“ sources in R&B depart ment told TOI.
 
 As per the schedule, CM had to lay foundation stone for the villas in December on the day his new camp office was inaugurated; but this was postponed due to various reasons.
 
 Unless the finance department gives administrative sanction, we cannot begin the tender process. Our aim is to complete the construction of villas by the end of 2017, but this will be delayed, said an official with knowledge of the matter.
 
 When TOI contacted engineer-in-chief, R&B department, I Ganapathi Reddy, he said, demonetisation move could be the reason for the delay. “I too pursued the matter with the secretary, finance department, and asked that administrative sanction be granted,“ he said.
