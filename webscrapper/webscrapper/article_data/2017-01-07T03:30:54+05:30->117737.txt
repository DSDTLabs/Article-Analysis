NEW DELHI: Recently, a Class VII student of a private school was not allowed to enter her classroom because her father,  , an EDMC fourth-grade employee, could not pay her monthly fee. His son is enrolled in Class V in the same school and he too was humiliated by the school administration for the same reason, claims Tyagi. “I received a notice from the school, asking me to pay the fees as soon as possible. What can I do,” he asked.

 Tyagi is one of the corporation employees, who has been hit hard due to non-payment of salary for the past three months. Many are finding it difficult to even borrow money from friends and relatives. “Nobody wants to lend us money because we seek loan every month without repaying the previous debt,” said  , an ad hoc sweeper with EDMC. Tyagi had to mortgage the jewellery of his wife to borrow Rs 40,000 to meet medical, food and educational expenses of his four-member family.
 
 The story of  , a fourth-grade employee, is no different. Salary problem has left him with no money and the family of four is living in utter penury. So much so that one of his children, who had a hole in his heart, died two months ago due to lack of proper medical care. “A private hospital asked me to deposit Rs 7 lakh. But I had no money and therefore, I shifted my child to a government hospital,” a teary-eyed Singh told TOI. 
 
 Most employees need to pay Rs 4,000-5,000 per month as house rent. The landlord of Nempal, a gardener, has threatened to evict him if he does not clear the arrears this month. “I have been spending a large amount of my income on my wife’s treatment. She has cough for the past 10 years. I have taken her to many doctors but without luck,” he said.
 
 Nempal has three daughters. The eldest one has dropped out of college as he could not bear the cost of her education.   earns Rs 30,000 a month, but now, his finances are in a mess due to the erratic payment of salary.
