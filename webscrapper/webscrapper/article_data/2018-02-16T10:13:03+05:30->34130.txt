BATHINDA/CHANDIGARH: The family of 28-year-old Puneet Kaur, who died after her hair got stuck in the chain of a go-kart in Pinjore on Wednesday, was to celebrate the second birthday of her son on February 17. 

 The family’s house in Rampura Phul in   district will be thronged by mourners and not birthday-wishers now. Her father-in-law Ajinder Singh was at a loss of words. He remembered the call his two-year-old grandson Ranbir made on Wednesday forenoon. “Ranbir had said, ‘Dadu we are near Chandigarh and will return by late evening’,” said a sobbing Ajinder Singh.
 
 Ranbir, his father   Singh and mother Puneet had left Rampura on Tuesday to attend a marriage near Chandigarh. After the wedding function, they went to Pinjore.
 
 Ganganagar-based Puneet had married Amardeep, a farmer and commission agent, on November 28, 2014. Though Ranbir turned two last month, the family could not celebrate his birthday due to personal problems and had booked a resort at Rampura to celebrate it on February 17.
 
 Amardeep’ uncle   said three of them were very happy to go to Pinjore and the family here was making preparations for the birthday. We are in shock.”
