AHMEDABAD: When did you last speak to your teenage son or daughter about sex? A recent study by a team of doctors from NHL Municipal College at Shardaben Hospital reveals that teens between 15 and 19 years of age are contracting nearly half as many   prevalent in adults twice their age. 

 Of the 381 teens studied, 200 boys and 181 girls, nearly 77% of boys and 51% of girls said they were sexually active with partners. This should concern teachers and parents.
 
 Anita Mehta, a councillor with a school in Satellite says, “The majority of teens are uncomfortable talking to their parents about sex. Such children are very unlikely to ask for help when unusual symptoms appear and they need to be tested or treated for a sexually transmitted infection.”
 
 Among teenage girls, nearly 69% (126) had vulvovaginal discharge — which may have resulted from a yeast infection, 9.4% had bacterial vaginosis and 8% had herpes progenitalis. Among the boys, nodular scabies infection was found in 62%, 10.5% had genital molluscum, while 9.5% had herpes progenitalis. 
 
 The study was conducted by Jigna Barot, Avanita Solanki, Neela Patel, Khushboo Modi, Miral Bodar of the department of dermatology, AMC-MET Medical College, and  . Their study claimed that sexual activity began as early as 10 years among street boys and in the mid and late teens among boys and girls from rural and urban areas. Mehta adds, “This fear of approaching an elder can be dangerous because an untreated infection can have consequences like a pelvic inflammation and can even lead to infertility. Parents should begin engaging with talk on such essential topics in the early teens.”
