GURUGRAM: The state government has sanctioned Huda’s Rs 453-crore plan to widen the Badshapur drain and construct stormwater drains and wells along Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and  , in an attempt to tackle   across the city where people still shudder at the thought of 2016 Gurujam.

 As per the plan, Rs 174 crore will be used for widening of Badshapur drain and increasing its carrying capacity. A senior   official said they had already started work on the drain and with the government clearing the budgetary allocation, the project would now gain steam, he added.
 
 Huda administrator   said they were working to remove the obstacles coming in the way of Badshapur drain widening. “We will clear the drain before monsoon. The engineering department has been directed to expedite the work,” he said.
 
 Currently, the carrying capacity of the drain reduces mainly after Hero  , causing waterlogging in the areas surrounding this busy junction on NH-8. “The plan is to increase the drain’s carrying capacity to 2,300 cusec near Ghata (where the drain starts) and subsequently raise it up to 4,000 cusec by the end (when it meets Najafgarh drain),” said the official.
 
 During monsoons, over 1,000 cusec of water flows into the drain near Khandsa, causing waterlogging at Hero Honda Chowk — the choke-point of the 20-hour-long Gurujam — service roads, Sectors 33-34 and nearby areas.
 
 The remaining Rs 279 crore will be used for construction of stormwater drains along SPR, Dwarka Expressway. “We will install master pipelines, having a capacity of 2,300-3,500 cusec, along these roads to flush out excess rainwater from the new sectors (58-115),” said another official.
 
 The work on these drains will start next year. These apart, Huda will make re-charge wells, 20 meter apart, along the drains to rejuvenate groundwater tables. These wells also slow down the flow of rainwater and avoid flash floods.
