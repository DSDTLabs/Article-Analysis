AHMEDABAD: A city-based practising advocate,  , will get his passport after the   issued directions. He was denied a passport by the authorities because a criminal case, pertaining to a trivial matter, was pending against him since the 2002 riots.

 Advocate Surti had to wait for seven years after applying for a passport due to a mistake by the concerned court, which lost the case papers, leaving Surti without a chance to put forth any argument before the passport authorities. They continued to deny him a passport on the pretext that criminal proceedings were pending against him.
 
 Finally, the high court stepped in and Justice J B Pardiwala directed the Regional Passport Officer (RPO) to act upon Surtiâ€™s application and issue him a passport with a validity of five years. The court asked the RPO to issue the document in two weeks and if possible even earlier because the advocate has to go to the US on account of a social issue, said his advocate Sikander Saiyed.
 
 According to case details, Surti was studying law in 2002. At exam time, he and his friends ventured out to the examination centre when curfew was imposed on the city. He was booked under section 188, for violation of the curfew notification and the case was pending against him since then.
 
 Surti applied for passport in 2010. He tried to pursue the matter before the magisterial court but to his surprise, his case papers were missing. The court registry could not trace the papers for seven years when Surti continued to demand them under  . As the court could not say anything, the passport authorities remained adamant and did not process his applicable in the absence of a no-objection certificate (NOC). Now, the HC has asked them to put in all efforts to deliver a passport to Surti as quickly as possible.
