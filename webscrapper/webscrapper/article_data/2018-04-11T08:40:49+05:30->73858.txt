BHOPAL:   shrouds the disappearance of a brother of  , daughter-in-law of minister Rampal Singh, whose suicide last month triggered a political storm in the state. 

 Preity’s family says her brother, Deepak, is missing from home for the past three days. They went to police on Monday night to file a complaint, but were stunned when the cops said that Deepak had gone on his free will and given them a statement a few hours earlier.
 
 His kin say that they haven’t seen him since April 7, when the family filed a case in an Udaipura court, seeking an FIR against minister Rampal Singh, his son Girjesh and others in the case. Deepak was with them during the court proceedings, but did not return home. On April 9, his family lodged a complaint with Udaipura police that Deepak is missing since April 7. 
 
 But Bareliy subdivisional officer of police, Rajaram Sahoo, told TOI that Deepak has contacted them twice. “Deepak gave his statement to me, which was recorded on camera, between 4pm and 5pm. Moreover, today he reached out to Udaipura police and said he has gone out on his own free will,” Sahoo said. 
 
 Udaipura police station in-charge, Manoj Dubey, said, “Deepak Raghuvanshi arrived at the police station around 7.30pm on Tuesday and said he had come to know that his family had filed a missing person’s report. he said he had gone on his own and visited several places like Piparia and Hoshangabad. He said he does not want to meet his family members now and will not be returning home.” 
 
 This adds a mysterious twist to an already controversial case. Preity, 28, daughter of Chandan Raghuvanshi, had committed suicide on March 16 in her house in Udaipura. She did not blame anyone in her suicide note, but her family accused Rampal Singh of driving her to suicide because they did not accept her marriage with Girijesh. They showed an Arya Samaj marriage certificate to say the two married in June 2017.
