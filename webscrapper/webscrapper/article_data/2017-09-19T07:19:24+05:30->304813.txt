LONDON: The bomb attack on London's   station, which left over 30 people injured on Friday, was allegedly facilitated by two refugees ­ from Syria and Iraq.

 Although police have not confirmed their identity, sources said one of the suspects was  , a 21-year-old from Damascus. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command arrested Farroukh on Saturday .
 
 Farroukh's Facebook page states he is from Damascus and was studying at West Thames College since 2013. According to reports, Farroukh was arrested on the basis of a CCTV footage, which showed him carrying a bag that resembled the one used to carry out the attack. A spokeswoman at West Thames College said, “We have been asked that all calls about this are directed to Metropolitan Police.“ Lecturers at all higher education colleges in the UK are obliged by law to follow Prevent strategy, which means they have to be trained to spot signs of radicalisation and they must act upon it and refer such cases when they come across them.
 
 The 18-year-old, held at Dover port, is believed to be an Iraqi refugee orphan who moved to the UK when he was 15. He was arrested on suspicion of commission and preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. 
 
 Both men are believed to have spent some time at the home of elderly British foster carers Ronald Jones, 88, and Penelope Jones, 71. The couple has fostered at least 268 children, including refugees from conflict zones, in the last four decades. The couple was named Members of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE), an honorary recognition awarded by UK, for their services to children and families in 2009. 
 
 Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, national lead for counter-terrorism policing, said, “There are now two searches continuing at addresses in Surrey and we are getting a greater understanding of the preparation of the device.“
 
 UK police have up to 14 days to question the suspects before they have to charge or release them from custody.
