NEW DELHI: High-rises in Lutyens Delhi were mostly built in compliance with the  . But with changes in the layouts, the designs have become outdated as far as present   measures are concerned. 

 The consecutive fires at   has left the fire officials worried. Officials said that most of the blazes in these high-rises are caused due to the exposed wirings in the building, which were built according to the norms of the time they were erected. While all of them had clearances from the fire department while being constructed, most were not renewed.
 
 Under the new rules, the fire safety certificate issued is valid for 5 years for residential   (other than hotels) and 3 years for non-residential buildings, including hotels from date of issue.
 
 Officials said that a fire clearance certificate is not a guarantee that the building will never meet with an accident, it just means that a reasonable fire safety measure has been taken. It also depends on the maintenance of the building, they said.
 
 “Under DFS rules 2010 of Delhi Fire Service Act 2007, the occupier of the building or premises, as the case may be, should maintain the fire prevention and safety measures provided in the building or premises at all times,” said chief fire officer Atul Garg.

 Almost all cinema halls, guest houses, big malls and high-rise buildings in the city have been issued an NOC by the department.
