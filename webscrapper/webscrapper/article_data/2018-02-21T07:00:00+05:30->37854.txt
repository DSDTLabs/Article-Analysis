Ludhiana: Two employees of a Delhi-based company have been booked for allegedly raping two of their colleagues at a hotel in Ludhiana.

 The four worked for an event management company and were sent to Ludhiana for an assignment.
 
 One of women, who were allegedly raped, lodged a complaint with the police, alleging that the men, belonging to different districts in Uttar Pradesh, gave them intoxicants in the form of medicine before committing the crime.
 
 It all happened on late Monday night when the four returned to their hotel, arranged by their company, after completing their assignment. They had taken different rooms for the men and women.
 
 But the women could not open the door to their room as it was jammed, she claimed. The use of a master key also proved futile. With no option left, the women decided to stay in the room of their colleagues, she added.
 
 She alleged that since she was feeling unwell, one of the men gave her some medicine after which she fell asleep. She alleged her friend was also given some sedative. The accused raped the women afterwards, she claimed.
 
 Sumit Sood, SHO, Sarabha Nagar police station, said the police have registered a case under sections 376 (rape) and 34 (act done by several people in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. The police are investigating the case.
