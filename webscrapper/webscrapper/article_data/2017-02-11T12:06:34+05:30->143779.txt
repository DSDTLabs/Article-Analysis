NAGPUR: The  , which is constituent of the NDA at the Centre and its top leader   enjoying post of minister in the Modi government, on Friday filed a complaint against the local BJP with the election officials.

 Addressed to the state election commissioner and the chief election officer of the city, the RPI (Athawale) group’s city president   in his complaint said despite clear assertion by the party chief that there is no pre-poll alliance between the RPI (A) and BJP anywhere except Mumbai, the BJP was using RPI flag and Athawale’s pictures in posters and election material of BJP candidates in Nagpur.
 
 Waghmare said talks with city BJP fizzled out as they refused to give 15 seats to RPI (A). The BJP was ready to spare only seven seats that too on condition of using the lotus symbol. “BJP is unethically using our party flag and Athawale’s photos to mislead the voters. This would affect our party candidates chances,” said Waghmare. The RPI has on its own fielded four candidates — two in prabhag 13 and one each in 4 and 38.
 
 If the election officials fail to act, the RPI has threatened legal action against the BJP.
