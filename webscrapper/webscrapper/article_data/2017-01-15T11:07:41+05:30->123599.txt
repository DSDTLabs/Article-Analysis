PANAJI:   (MGP) on Friday said that the hint given by Union minister   to bring back defence minister   as chief minister, has shown that BJP has no faith in its 37 candidates who will contest the February 4 assembly elections.

 Speaking to mediapersons, MGP’s Ponda MLA Lavoo Mamledar said that Gadkari is trying to misguide the people by making such statements. “When you have 37 candidates and are going to win 26 seats, despite that, getting a CM from outside is a misguiding statement by Gadkari,” he added.
 
 MGP also released its second list of five candidates for the February 4 assembly elections. Mahesh Satelkar will contest the Aldona constituency, while Rajesh Vishnu Sinai Amonkar will contest Porvorim and   will contest Cortalim. MGP also announced the candidature of Prakash Naik from   and Jayesh Naik from Margao. So far, MGP has announced the names of 23 candidates and its final list of candidates will be announced on Sunday.
