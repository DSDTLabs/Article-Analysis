INDORE:   will stay away from work on March 31 following a call for a   made by the   against the recommendations of the law commission of India. In its report, the committee seeks to set up an independent committee in every district to take disciplinary action against advocates.

 The Indore high court bar association and the   will both support the protest and all advocates will refrain from going to courts. Legal proceedings at the high court will remain affected for the next three days, as the protest will fall just before the weekend.
 
 “We are protesting against the law commission’s recommendation to set up an independent body at every district level to decide upon complaints made against   and take disciplinary action against advocates. As per the recommendations, the committee might also include people not related to the legal profession,” Manish Yadav, secretary of Indore high court bar association said.
 
 For any complaint against the conduct of advocates, the appellate authority was the state bar council, which comprised of senior advocates and members of the bar council. However, constitution of an independent body to regulate lawyers would end the current system.
 
 As many as 2,900 advocates are enrolled at the Indore high court bar association and around 6,000 members are enrolled at the district court bar association. The legal proceedings at the eight single benches and five division benches (constituted on Fridays) of high court in Indore will be affected. At the district court, legal work in 49 courts at Indore district court and 14 tehsil courts will be affected.
 
 The suggestion being objected to is that at every district headquarter, the district judge may constitute an advocates’ grievance redressal committee headed by a judicial officer which will deal with day to day routine matters, as a large number of issues and grievances arise in the smooth working of the advocates.
