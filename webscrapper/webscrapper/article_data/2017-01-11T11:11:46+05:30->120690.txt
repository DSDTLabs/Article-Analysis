PATNA: Health experts on Tuesday rued the lack of   in a number of hospitals across the state despite the growing number of lifestyle diseases in the country.

 Addressing a workshop titled ‘Consult dietitian, get fooducated’ which was organized by the Bihar   at the   (PMCH), retired dietitian Girindra Mohan Kumar said, “A dietitian busts several myths associated with food and nutrition. People believe that eating guava during cough and cold worsens it. However, the fruit is rich in vitamin C which builds immunity.”
 
 Kumar also highlighted the ill effects of consuming junk food which is unhealthy and leads to a number of lifestyle diseases.
 
 Another dietitian Sanjay Kumar Mishra, who works with a private city hospital, said there was only a 4% difference between the amount of carbohydrates found in rice and chapati. “Both food items have similar carbohydrate levels, but different nutritional value. It is the quantity one consumes that affects one’s health,” he added.
 
 A dietitian assesses the nutritional status of a patient in a clinical setting and develops diet plans accordingly. Dietetic association secretary Sudhakar Mishra said, “At a time when diseases like obesity and diabetes have become so common, more dietitians need to be appointed across the state. Other than some government hospitals in Bihar, most health institutions have not realized how important the role of a dietitian is.”
 
 Over 100 PMCH nurses and dietitians from different hospital of the city participated in the workshop.
