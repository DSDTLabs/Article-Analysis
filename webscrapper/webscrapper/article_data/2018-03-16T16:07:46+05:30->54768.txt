As he was not responding to her calls, the victim’s sister rushed home from her workplace and discovered his body hanging from the ceiling. Later, she informed police around 10.30am. Police suspect Sagar might have committed suicide an hour earlier. The body was shifted to   for an autopsy. Police have registered a case under Section 174 of the CrPC.
