Ariyalur: Often referred to as one of the most underdeveloped districts in the state, Ariyalur and its people have something to cheer about now, as it has secured the coveted open defecation free (ODF) district tag. The announcement came from the Union ministry of drinking water and sanitation on Monday as the district managed to construct 64,000 individual toilets in just a period of nine months to keep open defecation at bay.

 With as many as 201 village panchayats, two town panchayats and two municipalities, the initiative to establish individual toilets across the district was actively taken up by the district rural development agency (DRDA) from April 1, 2017. Through the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) funds, DRDA officials said that around 64,000 individual toilets were built before December 2017 across the district particularly in the belts where open defecation was rampant.tnn
