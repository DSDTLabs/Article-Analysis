ROURKELA: The   recovered   of   from a one-bed room quarters of   under   district on Monday. 

 Police said residents of the colony of Kulda coal mines, a unit of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd, had informed Hemgiri police station on Monday morning that the closed quarters of the colony was stinking. 
 
 A team of police visiting the spot had suspected death of some persons inside the house. Since it was locked from inside, the police officials had informed the higher authorities.
 
 Senior police officials, including Sundargarh SP Pinak Mishra, reached the spot and the house was broken open in presence of Hemgiri tehsildar Latika Patel as the magistrate. Police recovered five bodies from that house. The deceased have been identified as Ramayan Prasad Sharma, 50, his wife Milli Sharma, 43, their son Rabindra, 19, elder daughter Sanju, 16, and younger daughter Anju, 11.
 
 Police sources said Ramayan Prasad was a native of Uttar Pradesh and was staying in the official quarters for last few years. He was reportedly working as a labour contractor in the mines. According to neighbours they have not seen the family members coming out since Friday. 
 
 The incident has sent shock waves in the district. It has not been ascertained whether Sharma was allotted that house by MCL or was staying there on rent. 
 
 Since, all doors of the house were locked from inside, the possibility of a murder is very remote in this case, said Mishra. "During preliminary investigation, we located a generator and the five might have been asphyxiated due to its smoke," Mishra said. 
 
 A team of doctors would conduct the postmortem in this case, Mishra added.
 
 Police also did not rule out the possibility of a mass suicide. Mass suicide can be ascertained after postmortem and further investigation, Mishra said.
