Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) is keen to re-start helicopter rides from Ela Goa helipad which is owned by the government. The helipad which is not in use will be redeveloped and tender for the same will be floated shortly, GTDC chairman Nilesh Cabral told TOI.

 Cabral said GTDC wants to restart helicopter rides for this tourist season. 
 
 “I have spoken to power minister Pandurang Madkaikar as Ela falls in his constituency,” said Cabral.
 
 While GTDC has finalized helipad at Ela, it is also looking at other options. A helipad at Vagator in North Goa is also being considered.
 
 Cabral said he has inspected the place which he thinks would be ideal in terms of attracting tourists.
 
 “I have written to chief minister Manohar Parrikar to allow GTDC to use helipad at Vagator,” Cabral said. The GTDC also plans to write to local panchayat about its plans to use the helipad.
 
 A year and a half ago, the corporation had to stop rides from the helipad at Fort Aguada, following protests by fishermen, supported by local politicians.
 
 They claimed sound pollution, dust pollution and disturbance to local guest houses and the heritage site of Aguada fort. 
 
 The GTDC then shifted helicopter rides to South Goa and used a helipad of a starred hotel for the rest of the season. It could not resume the service for 2016-17 tourism season.
 
 The South Goa helicopter rides proved to be uneconomical as tourists had to be ferried to South Goa which has lesser concentration of domestic tourists.
