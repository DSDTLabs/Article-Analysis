Hyderabad: Coming down heavily on the TRS government and the police for alleged third degree torture of Dalits and BCs in Jillella village of Rajanna-Siricilla district, the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) on Thursday demanded an inquiry by a sitting judge of the high court.

 Two days ago, TPCC working president Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and other senior leaders had visited the government hospital in Karimnagar where the injured villagers are undergoing treatment. The victims displayed the injuries they suffered during interrogation in police custody.
 
 “This is nothing but terrorizing those who raised their voice against   that is killing people. More than 42 people, including 12 in Rajanna-Sircilla district, have died in road accidents and other incidents involving the sand mafia. The TRS government should take action against the police officials who are shielding the sand mafia,” said Vikramarka.
 
 It all started when a villager, Bhumaiah, 60, was mowed down by a speeding sand-laden lorry near Ramchandrapuram village. Angry villagers tried to set fire to some trucks carrying sand, claiming they were responsible for a series of deaths in and around their village. 
 
 Police intervened when the protest turned violent. They arrested eight villagers and reportedly suffured injuries during the altercation.
 
 “They (villagers) were beaten black and blue. When some of them became unconscious, the worried police shifted them to the district hospital,” the Congress leaders said.
 
 Speaking to the media on Thursday, Congress legislature party leader K Jana Reddy and opposition leader in the Legislative Council Shabbir Ali demanded the immediate removal of the police officials responsible.
 
 A BJP delegation also visited the hospital and demanded a case under IPC 307 and SC, ST Atrocities Act.
