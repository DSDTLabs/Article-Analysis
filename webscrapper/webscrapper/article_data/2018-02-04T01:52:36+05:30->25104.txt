NEW DELHI:   might have survived had the onlookers rushed him to hospital instead of clicking his photos and videos. 

 Ankit’s father said on Friday that people were busy taking his photos instead of helping him. The victim’s mother, Kamlesh, who was with him during the incident, also said at least 20-30 people had gathered around her clicking videos while she was calling for help, holding Ankit’s head on her lap, but nobody helped them. 
 
  blame this   on the advent of social media and the lack of a law to protect a Good Samaritan in such a case.
 
 Mental health expert Rajat Mitra said, “People usually tend to help others. However, most of them also fear the law. They feel that clicking a video or a photo and putting it up on social media would secure justice for the victim later without bringing him or her in the direct line of the law.” 
 
 Experts said that besides providing a legal shield, the police force needs to be sensitised as well. “Studies have found that the police invariably start questioning a person who reports a crime for clues. This often leads to harassment. There should be a law that protects the Good Samaritan without hampering the probe,” said Mitra.
 
 A study by behavioural science expert Daniel Goldman has found that in every society, empathy is usually bypassed when a person trying to help a victim is stopped by the fear of harassment. 
 
 Psychologist Jayanti Dutta attributed the behaviour to the changing society. “People fear retribution from the accused. They feel that if the accused manages to evade the law, they will be targted. With cases of violence on the rise, this is a natural behaviour.”
