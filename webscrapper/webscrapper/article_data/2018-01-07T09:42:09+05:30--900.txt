INDORE:   ( ) on Saturday carried out a survey in   area to take stock of hurdles removed by the locals. A massive   drive to remove the encroachments to pave way for   project in the area is likely to begin in next couple of days.

 He said that the corporation had marked 123 structures including some commercial establishments on one side of the road, while 86 structures on another side for complete/partial demolition on the 600-metre stretch under the road widening project.
 
 “As many as 65 structures, erected illegally upon the river’s catchment area have been marked for the removal,” said Sharma.
 
 IMC also made public announcement urging the affected people to remove their structures posing as hurdles in the road widening project else IMC will rope in earth movers to remove them and then it will not be responsible for any damage.
 
 “As the affected people are removing the marked structures, we have decided to give them more time. Besides, we are also coordinating with local police and administration to provide us the required support to launch the demolition drive,” Sharma said.
 
 The civil body has thus far identified around 150 structures, which will reduced to less than 10-15 square feet area after the demolition drive and thus, the occupants will be provided flats in different schemes of IMC.
 
 There are some religious structures also on the proposed 80-foot wide road, which will connect Sarwate to   bus stand.
