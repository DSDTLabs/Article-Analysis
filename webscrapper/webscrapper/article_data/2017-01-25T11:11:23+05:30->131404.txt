KARACHI: Pakistan's top performer   has hinted that he didn't speak about his problems during  's tenure as coach because he was insecure about being dropped from the team.

 When asked about an incident where he had gone to the chief selector and requested him not to rest him for a tour of Zimbabwe, Sarfraz admitted this was true.
 
 "I was a bit insecure because I had been dropped from the last T20 matches before the Zimbabwe tour after performing and I was concerned if my replacement performed what would happen," he told Geo Super channel.
 
 Reminded that he was the top wicketkeeper-batsman of the team who had been performing consistently well than why was he insecure, Sarfraz remained elusive in his reply.
 
 But when asked about the events of the World Cup 2015 in New Zealand and Australia, when Waqar didn't play him in the first four matches despite public pressure, Sarfraz tried to play the issue down.
 
 "I feel scared to say too much. It could lead to me being dropped. I fear being dropped from the team because I have seen what happened to some other players."
