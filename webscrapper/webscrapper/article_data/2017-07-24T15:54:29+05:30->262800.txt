AHMEDABAD: The project for producing   (SOP) in Gujarat with indigenous technology got another boost earlier this month with production of SOP-based fertilizer at technology validation plant in Mithapur. Experts, however, feel that there is a long way to go for the technology which was developed a decade ago by scientists at Bhavnagar-based Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute ( ).

 The project, partially funded by Gujarat Council on Science and Technology (GUJCOST), also included use of produced fertilizer at Junagadh and Anand-based agricultural universities to ascertain its application and effectiveness. GUJCOST officials said that the results received in June have been encouraging.  , advisor, GUJCOST, said that SOP is a non-chloride potash fertilizer and is used globally for high-value crops. “Our attempt is to provide impetus to Make in India movement by promoting indigenous research and applications. We are hopeful that the encouraging results will pave way for the compound’s commercial production and bringing down dependence on its import,” he said. 
 
 CSMCRI has international patented technology for integrated process to recover sulphate of potash and refractory grade magnesia from sea bittern found in abundance in Gujarat . Center’s department of science and technology (DST) has also supported the project, said GUJCOST officials. India imports about 4 million tonnes potash annually.
