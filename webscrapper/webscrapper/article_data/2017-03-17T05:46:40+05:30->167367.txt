LUCKNOW: The   officials’ claims to curb use of unfair means fell flat on the first day as most of the   cameras at the examination centres were either found to be defunct or inadequate. 

 UP Board had announced to crack down on rampant   in this year’s board examinations with the help of ‘UP Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad’ attendance app and CCTV cameras. But during a reality check done by TOI, CCTV   at Kunwar Asif Ali Montessori Inter College were found defunct, while at Itaunja’s Mateshwari Vidya Mandir the display of the cameras was not working. “We have issued strict instructions to centre superintendents to equip their centres with CCTV cameras. Action will be taken against errant colleges,’’ said district inspector of schools, Lucknow, Umesh Tripathi when apprised about the condition of CCTV cameras.
 
 At Khun Khunji Girls’ Inter College in Lucknow, only two CCTV cameras were installed, too less for a centre with over 800 students. Likewise, at Bishan Narayan Inter College in Lucknow, only two cameras were installed and that too had a blurred display. When asked about the non-functional cameras, the school’s principal Satyendra Dwivedi said, “The government only issues notification for the installation of cameras but provides no funds for their installation.”
 
 On the other hand, most invigilators were clueless about the ‘UPMSP’ attendance app, which was launched to curb instances of cheating in board examinations. “We have got no notification about any app from the Board authorities. Last year, we were provided with a SIM card which did not function due to connectivity issues,’’ said Khun Khunji Girls’ Inter College principal Shobha Singh.
 
 “We have been asked to record attendance of the students manually, and a student appearing for the examination has to sign against his/her name on the attendance sheet,’’ said the centre superintendent of a government college.
