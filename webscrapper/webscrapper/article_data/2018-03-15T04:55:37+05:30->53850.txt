THANE: The first lottery round under the   (RTE) process was announced on Tuesday. Out of 42,678   applications in Thane district this year, 15,202 applications were considered for the first round of the lottery system. From this, 5,702 made it in the first round.

 ‘‘Last year, there were over 11,000 applications who were selected in the first round. This year, the number dropped because we wanted to ensure that students get selected in schools that are close to their home. So, we considered only the applications of students living in less than 1-km radius from the school in round 1. Through this system, less parents will have to worry about their child’s transport and safety,’’ said an official from the  .
 
 “However, this system will only be followed for the first round, after which everyone will be included in the lottery system for their choices of schools,” the official said.
 
 Once the selection lists were released on Tuesday, parents of the selected applicants were sent an SMS informing them about it. They immediately made a bee line for their preferred schools to complete the   process on Wednesday. “We have taken many steps to ensure that parents are in the loop of the entire process and have submitted their documents properly. We have also set up a number of help centres to guide them in each block in the district. Besides, parents are informed whether their child has been selected or not through a text message,” said an official at the Thane ZP.
 
 The selected students will have to visit their school and complete the admission procedure by March 24, after which the dates of the next lottery round will be announced.
