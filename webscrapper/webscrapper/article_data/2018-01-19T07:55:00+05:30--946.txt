JALANDHAR: To tackle the issue of illegal sand mining that has again taken centre stage following Rana Gurjit Singh’s resignation, Chabbewal Congress   Dr   has announced cash reward from his salary to anyone giving credible information on illegal sand mining in his constituency.

 He has asked the people of his constituency to tip him off on his mobile phone about illegal mining and he would give Rs 1,000 from his own pocket while ensuring that the informer’s identity is not disclosed.
 
 “I always opposed illegal sand mining during the SAD-BJP rule and after the   took reins, I asked the local official to remain strict against sand mining. Chabbewal being a large constituency with a lot of villages in   area is more prone to illegal mining and chances of miners escaping the eye of officers concerned are also there. The general public also needs to be more aware and help us to get hold of people involved in such activity. If they come across any case of illegal mining, they can inform immediately on my mobile no. and I would immediately ask the officials to crackdown,” the MLA said on Thursday.
 
 He also said that any administrative or government official found indulging in promoting illegal mining would also not be spared.
