PANAJI: The flags are up, the wind is in its sails, and INS Mhadei, the Indian Navy’s ocean-sailing sloop, is racing towards Rio as part of the Cape Town-to-Rio de Janeiro race. No small feat by any standards, what makes the race even more significant for the Indian Navy is that two naval women officers, with ocean-conquering ambitions, are part of the crew.

 The Cape Town-to-Rio race is the longest continent-to-continent yacht race in the southern hemisphere with a total race length of 6,500km across the South Atlantic Ocean. The race, which takes place once in every three years, is known as one of the toughest yacht races in the world.
 
 INSV Mhadei, which is based at  , unfurled her sails on January 1 from Cape Town with Captain  , an Asian Games silver medalist at its helm. The race would be undertaken by a mixed crew of men and women and has Captain Sinha at the helm.
 
 The two women officers to make India proud are Lieutenants Swathi Patharlapaali and Payal Gupta. The duo is part of an all-women crew being trained to circumnavigate the globe later this year, the Indian Navy said in a statement. 
 
 Sources said that the other four female officers would join the vessel on the return leg from Rio to Goa.
 
 “Mhadei is off to a great start and we have some exciting racing moments ahead of us,” said Gupta, one of the two female officers aboard the sailing yacht.
 
 The Bermudian sloop has been the crucible of India Navy’s ocean sailing aspirations. In 2010, Commander   became the first Indian to solo circumnavigate the globe followed by Lieutenant Commander Abhilash Tomy, the first Indian to sail across the globe alone, and without a stop, in 2013. The Indian Navy aspires to complete a circumnavigation of the globe with the first Indian all-women crew in 2017, and has handpicked six lady officers’ for the historic challenge. The six female officers are being trained at the newly-set up ocean sailing node in Goa.
