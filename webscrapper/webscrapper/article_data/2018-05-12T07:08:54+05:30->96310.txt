 The incident occurred recently at around 9.45pm near   when   was walking home. “I was holding the mobile set in my hand after ending a call with a friend, and was unaware about the boys who were waiting on a red-coloured two-wheeler,” Vandagekar told TOI.

 He later lodged a complaint at   police station, stating that two youth snatched his handset costing Rs 16,900 and rode away towards Ponda municipal market.
 
 Another incident was also reported near the same spot just over a week ago.
 
 But police said that they have not received any complaint regarding the second theft case.
