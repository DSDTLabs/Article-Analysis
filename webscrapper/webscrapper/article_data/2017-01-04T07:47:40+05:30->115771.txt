BENGALURU: T S Ganesh, an 80 year-old amateur astronomer, spent Monday night on the roof of his   residence, attempting to catch a glimpse of a comet that was first spotted in October 2016, headed towards the sun, safely bypassing earth.

 The comet,  , will be closest to earth on January 14, and is at its brightest till that date. However, those harbouring hopes of seeing it with the naked eye or with a pair of binoculars might be disappointed.
 
 “At any time, there are several comets orbiting the earth on course towards the sun. It is just that they are not visible to the naked eye. It is only when they are visible that people get excited about it, like  . The C2016 U1NEOWISE is not bright enough to be seen, especially not from a city with as much light pollution as Bengaluru,“ said Ganesh.
 
 Pramod Galgali, joint director of  , said the closer a comet moved towards the sun, the lower the chances of it being seen on earth due to refraction.
 
 “We measure the magnitude of stellar objects being visible to the naked eye with the lowest number representing least amount of brightness. Objects with a magni tude of 6 are the least bright objects visible to the naked eye, and C2016 U1NEOWISE with a magnitude of 8.5 is almost unobservable,“ he explained. At present, only space missions were able to observe such objects due to their sophisticated equipment and vantage point, he said. “Thus, faint objects cannot be seen at all by amateur enthusiasts with telescopes and binoculars due to light pollution,“ he said.
 
 Ganesh said he will try to spot the greenish blue object with binoculars. However, residing in cities and unpredictable brightness of common comets means enthusiasts are likely to be disappointed.
