JODHPUR: A major fire broke out at a Senna plant processing unit here in   early on Tuesday. Fire fighters had to demolish three walls of the godown, where the senna plants and leaves were stocked, as they were intensifying the fire. 

 About two dozen fire tenders took almost 8 hours to control the fire.
 
 Cause of fire is yet to be ascertained but prima facie, the fire broke out due to some short circuit. The total loss is being assessed by the owners.
 
 SHO (Boranada)   said that the unit belongs to one Hariom Industries in the   under Boranada Industrial Area.
 
  The unit processed Senna plants by separating its leaves and seeds. It also has a godown containing a huge stock of sacks containing Senna plants and leaves.
 
 “Early on Tuesday morning, a fire broke out in the unit and spread quickly due to the combustible nature of dried leaves,” said Singh.
 
 People spotted flames emerging out of the unit and immediately informed the fire brigade station, police and the owner of the factory, who rushed to spot.
 
 However, by the time they reached, the fire had engulfed the entire godown, where hundreds of sacks were stored. 
 
 Fire tenders from the Boranada station reached the spot but were unable to control the fire. The fire kept on intensifying which threatened to engulf the nearby industrial units. 
 
 Thus, fire tenders from other stations were also called. 
 
 Since the fire had engulfed the entire godown, fire fighters had to raze the walls with the help of   machine.
 
  It took about two dozen fire tenders to douse the fire in about 8 hours.
