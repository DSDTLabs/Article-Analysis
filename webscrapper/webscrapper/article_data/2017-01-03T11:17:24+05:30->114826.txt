Panaji: Goa   (GPP) president   on Monday urged RSS rebel Goa Prant’s   (GSM) to weigh the pros and cons before finalizing its alliance with   (MGP) to contest 2017 assembly elections.

 Speaking to TOI, Raut said that MGP was part of the Congress-led coalition government when the decision to extend the grant-in-aid to English-medium schools was taken. The MGP was also a part of the BJP government which continues grant-in-aid to English medium schools.
 
 “I will request RSS Goa prant chief Subhash Velingkar not to have ties with MGP, as they were part of the decision taken by both Congress and BJP,” he said.
 
 “I hope Velingkar will keep his word given to me that I will be allowed to contest as a GSM-GPP alliance candidate. Even if GSM-MGP form an alliance and MGP is allowed to field a candidate in Bicholim, I will contest the Bicholim seat,” Raut said, when asked whether he will still contest from Bicholim if the GSM gives the Bicholim seat to MGP.
 
 Raut said his party formed an alliance with GSM first and it was followed by Shiv Sena and MGP. He also said that MGP “has been trying to get all seats including Bicholim”, where his name was announced as an alliance candidate.
 
 GSM and MGP recently formed an alliance. But, even as Raut’s name was announced as alliance candidate, no decision was taken about the Bicholim seat. MGP wants to field independent MLA   in Bicholim. Sawal has also announced his intention to join the MGP and contest the assembly elections on its ticket.
