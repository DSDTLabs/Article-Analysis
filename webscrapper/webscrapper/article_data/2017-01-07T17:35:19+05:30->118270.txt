CHANDIGARH: Charging additional amount for   without prior information cost Fun Cinemas,   Jagat in Sector 17D, Chandigarh dear. In a recent judgment, the   held   ‘deficient in rendering proper services’ to the Sector 49 based complainant and also held them guilty of indulging in ‘unfair trade practice’ for the act. The court directed them to refund additional money charged for 3D glasses and pay Rs 15,000 as compensation- cum-cost of litigation. The cinema hall charged around Rs 33 for each 3D glass.

 In his complaint, Karan Singla, a resident of Nirvana Society, Sector 49-B, Chandigarh stated that he along with his family went to the multiplex to watch a 3D film. The complainant bought three tickets and the bill amounted to Rs 611.25.
 
 Singla alleged that the breakup of the total price of Rs 203.75 was not fully explained in the tickets, as tickets only explained the breakup of Rs 170.
 
 “In this way, the Cinema charged Rs 33.75 per ticket,” said Singla. He pointed this out to an executive of the cinema hall with a request to refund the excess amount of Rs 101.25P, but to no avail.
 
 Citing deficiency in service and unfair trade practice on the part of cinema authorities, he filed the complaint.
 
 In their reply, cinema authorities said “Rs 170 was for the movie and the balance Rs 33.75P per ticket was on account of 3D glasses to be provided at the time of watching the movie, since it was a 3D movie.”
 
 After hearing both sides, the Forum said, “We find enough merit in the allegations of the complainant, in as much as the breakup mentioned on the ticket is “NETT: 130.70, E.TAX: 39.30= Total: 203.75”; whereas, the total should have been Rs 170. In this way, there is no denying the fact that cinema authorities charged Rs 33.75 per ticket from the complainant.”
