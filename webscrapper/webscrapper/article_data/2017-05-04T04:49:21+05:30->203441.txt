HALDIA: A 21-year-old youth was killed on Monday after being   while keeping his   away after shutting it down at his friend’s house at Solat in Haldia’s Bhabanipur. 

 A third-year Bengali Honours student of Haldia Government College, Subhro Pradhan had just finished watching the recently released ‘Bahubali II’ with four of his friends.
 
 The group had gone to a local multiplex earlier in the morning, but returned after failing to get tickets. Pradhan, however, was eager to watch the film on the same day, so he called his friends after lunch. 
 
 After watching the film, Pradhan’s friends Rajib, Azad, Sujay and his brother came out of the room, while he was wrapping up the laptop plugged into an extension cord. 
 
 When Pradhan didn’t come out even after 10 minutes, the four went back in and found him lying motionless on the bed with wires strewn around him. 
 
 “I called him. When he didn’t respond, I nudged his hand and felt a jolt. We immediately switched off the mains and called for help. Pradhan’s relatives and neighbours rushed over and we took him to a hospital where doctors declared him dead,” said Rajib.
 
 Pradhan wanted to apply for masters at Jadavpur University and had passed his Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations with meritorious scores.
 
 Pradhan’s father Gauranga said, “My son’s death has shattered our lives. I last saw him at lunch.” 
 
 East Midnapore SP Alok Rajoria said, “A case of unnatural death has been registered and we have begun a probe into the youth’s death. Our preliminary investigation shows it was an electrical   which affected the laptop.”
