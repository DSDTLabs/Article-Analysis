 In a series of tweets, he further wrote, “We considered your enemy as our own-...we filled the  , we served you with such an enthusiasm that you left our country with load shedding and gas shortage. We tried to please you on the cost of our economy ... For the past decades, we have been clearing the debris. We are feeling sorry as you are not happy but we will not compromise on our prestige any more.”
