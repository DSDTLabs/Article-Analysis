JAIPUR: An 18-month-old female   was stoned to death on Sunday by residents of   on NH-8 in Jaipur after it attacked and critically injured a villager earlier in the day. 

 The animal had strayed into the village looking for food when it attacked   (35) around 6.30am, while he was fetching water from a tank outside his house. The leopard caught him by the neck and dragged him for 20m.   was rescued and rushed to a hospital by villagers who pelted stones at the animal and hit it with sticks.
 
 Eyewitnesses claimed the animal died after being beaten to death. “As the leopard was on loose on the village streets, panic-stricken residents climbed atop a terrace. One of the villagers dropped a heavy iron rim on the animal’s head while it was climbing up the stairs to attack them. It lost consciousness and was stoned to death. The villagers acted in self-defence,” said an eyewitness.
 
 By the time police and forest department officials reached the spot, the villagers had already killed the animal. “The postmortem revealed that the leopard was in search of food for the last five to six days and died of injuries due to stone pelting. A case has been registered against unidentified men under the Wildlife Conservation Act,” said Jaipur north deputy forest conservator Yogendra Singh Kalvi.
 
 The lack of prey in forests has been forcing leopards to venture into human habitation and prey on livestock to satiate their hunger, said a forest official. Livestock management without proper measures to prevent attacks by wild animals also aggravates the problem.
