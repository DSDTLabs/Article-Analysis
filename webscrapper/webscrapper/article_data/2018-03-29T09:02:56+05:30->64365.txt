KOTTAYAM: A three-time  , who is recovering from a nasty knee injury, is facing an uphill task of returning to the tracks. It is triple jumper   Maheswary who is on a six-week rest at his home near here after undergoing a surgery at a Delhi hospital. Renjith, national record holder, had hurt himself seriously during the Federation Cup senior national athletics championships held in   earlier this month. He slipped and landed awkwardly on the hard synthetic turf hurting his left knee and ankle. He also dislocated his index finger. 

 Renjith was shifted to   in New Delhi where he underwent a knee surgery. He was also advised a six-week rest before starting rehabilitation programme. Renjith, who is at his residence here, is keen to return to the track and hope to start participating in competitions towards the end of this year. However, he is looking forward to getting support from the SAI or the state government to go through the rehabilitation programme. 
 
 The 32-year-old realises that it won't be possible for taking part in the Asian Games but has set his eyes on the World Championships in Qatar next year. "After six weeks of rest, I have to start the rehabilitation programme. I have consulted with physios in Chennai who are experts in the field. They have charted out a three-month programme," said Renjith.
 
 After the three month programme which includes physiotherapy, training at the gym, swimming, etc. Renjith can resume his training. Meanwhile, CPM district secretary   has demanded providing the best treatment and rehabilitation for Renjith in a memorandum given to sports minister A C Moideen. "The athlete needs the best treatment available. The government should do the necessary financial support and provide circumstances for this," said Vasavan.
