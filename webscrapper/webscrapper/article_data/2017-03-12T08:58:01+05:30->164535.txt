BHOPAL: In wake of Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance suffering a stunning defeat in the Uttar Pradesh state polls, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh alleged that the BJP had polarised the votes in the state.

 Talking to TOI after announcement of Assembly election results in five states, the senior Congress leader said that Prime Minister   and BJP president Amit Shah had aggressively divided people on communal lines.
 
 “Their politics starts with Hindu-Muslim and ends there,” he said. “For example, there was no need of raising the issues of ‘kabristan’ and ‘shamshaan’ in course of campaigning. It was never an issue in the elections in UP,” he said.
 
 To recall, Modi, during a poll rally in Fatehpur, had accused the Akhilesh Yadav-led government of indulging in discrimination on the basis of religion. Modi had said, “Gaon me kabristan banta hai to shamshaan bhi banna chahiye. Ramzan me bijli aati hai to Diwali me bhi aani chahiye. Bhedbhav nahi hona chahiye (If land is given for burial ground, it should be given for cremation ground also. If electricity is supplied during Ramzan, it should be supplied during Diwali also. There should not be discrimination.”
 
 On the issue of leadership, Digvijaya said that the Congress needs regional leaders. 
 
 “I have said this earlier also that we need to have new leadership in the states. We have to take decisive action for building the party in places where we face a dearth of strong satraps,” he said.
 
 When asked about the leadership of party vice-president Rahul Gandhi following the debacle in Uttar Pradesh, Digvijaya said that there is no question of Rahul stepping down. “The Nehru-Gandhi family is the greatest binding factor for the Congress whose leadership has to come to Rahul,” he said.
