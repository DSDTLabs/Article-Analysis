 Their forthcoming single, Miss Kardiyan — a groovy Punjabi number also sung by   — will be the first release on the channel. The trio has previously delivered popular numbers like Baby Doll and Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan. About the song, Manmeet Singh says, “This track has a Punjabi folk touch and a unique tune.

  They are also planning a series of musical love stories, which will be aired on the channel. The debut track of this series, Main Jaandiya by Neha Bhasin, will be out in April.
 
  From now on, Meet Bros will be releasing their singles and those of other artistes on the channel. Their aim, they say, is to offer pure melodies, soulful numbers and party tracks to music aficionados. “The channel is all about encouraging creativity and supporting untapped talent,”   sums up.
