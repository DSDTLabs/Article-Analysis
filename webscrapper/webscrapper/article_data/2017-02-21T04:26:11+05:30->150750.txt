SURAT: About 60-odd textile dyeing and printing mills at   are on the verge of closure following acute shortage of water for the last two months. Forget about running the mills, thousands of workers employed in the mills are not even getting water to drink. 

 A delegation of textile processors from Sachin GIDC on Monday submitted a memorandum to the notified area officer (NAO) of Sachin GIDC for resuming water supply at the earliest, or else the mills will have to down their shutters. 
 
 Industry sources said the water supply was severed two months ago following repair work of   canal which was undertaken by the irrigation department. Textile mills have been spending lakhs of rupees to purchase water from private tankers and are operating units at 50% capacity. Each of the textile mill has incurred losses to the tune of Rs30 lakh in the last two months taking total losses to the tune of over Rs20 crore, industry sources said. 
 
 Sachin Textile Process Industries Welfare Association ( ) president Vinod   told TOI, “For the last 10 days, the units are getting water supply for one hour in a day. The lake from where the water is supplied to the units is not getting enough water. Thus, we have asked the notified area authority to restore water supply or else the industry will have to shut down.”
 
 Agarwal added, “The units require around 60 million litre per day (MLD) of water, against which around 50% is managed through private tankers. This is a huge additional cost for unit owners, which is getting unbearable now.” 
 
 He said a project for the supply of tertiary treated water has been submitted to the   (SMC) and the unit owners are eagerly waiting for its final nod. 
 
 “If we get 35 MLD tertiary treated water from the SMC, rest of the water requirement will be met from the notified area authority’s pipeline network,” Agarwal added.
