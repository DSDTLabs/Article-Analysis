VISAKHAPATNAM: Despite all the hype and hoopla, the   in   is yet to take off. 

 Till now, only Grandhi Mallikarjuna Rao, founder of   and an alumnus of Andhra University, has pledged and donated Rs 1 crore, while the others, including Union minister M   are yet to contribute. 
 
 According to P  , a former student of AU residing in the USA now, “When AU came into existence, one of the greatest donors was the Rajah of Jeypore, Vikram Deo Varma, who donated more than Rs 17 lakh between 1930s and 1940s. Other great men pledged their properties and handed them over to the university as a gift. Let us not forget the munificence of the Vizianagaram royal family who gave away their entire Vizag estate and also donated millions for the nuclear physics department.”
 
 However, now such contributions are rare. A source in the university said, “Almost all old universities face the same fate, especially state-controlled varsities in the country. The problem lies in the fact that universities have now become centres to promote populist polices and not many of the alumni are willing to part with their savings on this account.”
 
 Meanwhile, the AU authorities are confident that people would come forward and donate to their Alma Mater. PS Rao, a former student of AU, from the department of civil engineering, said, “I want to give back to the university. However, I’m not sure that the funds would be properly disposed.”
