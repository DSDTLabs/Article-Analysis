Vadodara: The fate of independent MLA from Morva Hadaf in Panchmahal district Bhupendra Khant hangs in balance with a scrutiny committee invalidating his caste certificate negating his claim to be belonging to a tribal community. The constituency was reserved for tribal candidates.

 Khant had contested as an independent after the Congress gave the Morva Hadaf seat to Bharatiya Tribal Party in a seat sharing arrangement. He won the polls and declared support to the Congress.
 
 Tribal development commissioner R J Makadia said, “A vigilance committee to verify the schedule tribe certificate of Khant had been appointed. After the detailed record verification and first hand report committee recommended that the certificate is invalid. We have submitted the report. Now the court and concerned authorities will take decision.” The BJP said it would move the high court.
