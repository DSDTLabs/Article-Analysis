CHANDIGARH:   on Thursday decided to constitute two committees to meet the new chief minister of Punjab Captain   and also the officials of the   (MHRD) to take up the issue of financial crisis of   and seek their help. This was decided in a special senate meeting convened here on Thursday to discuss the financial crisis of the university. PU vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover has asked all senators to send their names voluntarily for these two committees.

 Moreover,   Senate has passed the resolution proposed by ambassador IS   here on Thursday that proposes that Panjab University is the statutory obligation of the Centre. The resolution states that the statutory obligation of the central government to take the responsibility of PU arises out of the Punjab Government Act VII of 1947, read with Para 5.2(c)(i) of the regulations relating to finance, which lists the government as one of the sources of income and Section 72(4) of the Punjab Re-organization Act, 1996, which casts the responsibility of the central government to determine the pattern of funding of Panjab University.
 
 The Senate members also discussed the â€˜allegations' levelled by UGC against the university. While a few senators suggested that when the UGC was finding so many flaws and wanted the university to generate more income, it should give a blueprint to the university to work on it. Grover also pointed out in the meeting that the varsity had not yet received any reports of the two fact-finding committees formed by the UGC after allegations of financial bunglings going on in PU were made. Moreover, ambiguity still prevails on the one-time emergency grant of Rs140 crore, since the varsity has received no communication regarding the grant.
