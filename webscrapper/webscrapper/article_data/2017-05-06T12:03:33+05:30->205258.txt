INDORE: In a gut-wrenching accident that played out in front of dozens of people on Friday, a man got trapped between a wall and an elevator in a shop in Siyaganj and kept pleading for help for two hours. By the time electric cutters broke through to free him, he was dead.

 “The man clung to life for around two hours and was pleading to get him out of there,” said  , an eyewitness. “It was heart breaking.”
 
 The victim,  , had hopped on the open cargo lift to move to the first floor of   godown at   area to fetch some goods for a customer. No one could tell police how he got stuck in that awkward position, but investigators believe that Bhatia was peeping down when the elevator went up, thus causing the back of his head to catch the roof of the ground floor. As the lift went up, he was dragged down the space between the lift and the wall and crushed upside down.
 
 His cries for help alerted shoppers and traders. Within minutes, the alarm went out and the entire area was a flutter. Dozens flocked to see if they could help. The fire brigade was called and they used electric cutters to try to reach Bhatia as his pleading for help grew weaker and weaker. An eyewitness said there was nothing anyone could do with bare hands to free him.
 
 By the time firemen cut through to him, he was dead. “The shop owner,  , has been arrested and booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Our investigations are on,” said Anil Yadav, MG Road police station in-charge. Preliminary probe has revealed that the godown operator installed the makeshift lift with iron grilles to carry heavy material from the ground floor to the first floor, say sources. The staff was not expected to use the lift to move from floor to floor.
