Panaji: A day after a handful of Congress MLAs voted for the BJP candidate in the presidential elections, the Congress managed to keep its flock together for the Rajya Sabha elections. Even though Congress candidate Shantaram Naik failed to win, the fact that Naik received all 16 votes was hailed as an achievement by the party. “This proves that all 16 MLAs are united. Not a single Congress MLA will split,” said Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Chandrakant Kavlekar. To try and avoid a repeat of the Thursday fiasco, which saw at least three Congress MLAs voting for BJP presidential candidate Ramnath Kovind, the CLP held a meeting to discuss on the cross voting. The party is still examining the matter to try and identify the Congress MLAs who voted against Congress candidate Meira Kumar who garnered the support of just 11 of the 16 party’s MLAs. “The Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Shantaram Naik was present for the meeting and all MLAs agreed to unanimously vote for the Congress candidate. Several MLAs expressed their views and now it is for the CLP leader to meet the MLAs on a one-on-one basis. Some introspection is required,” said Goa desk in-charge Amit Deshmukh. “It is a serious issue and will be reported to the high command. However, at the end of the day, it is a secret ballot and no action can be taken. The MLAs have to be accountable to their conscience,” a senior Congress leader said. The failure of Congress MLAs to stand by the party’s candidate clearly indicated that a rift remained. Sources say Manohar Parrikar remains in close touch with at least two Congress MLAs.
