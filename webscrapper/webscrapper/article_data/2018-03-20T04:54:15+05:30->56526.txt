MUMBAI: Should transplants be removed from the list of surgeries that poor patients can go for free of cost at charitable hospitals under the   (IPF) scheme? The issue is under the scanner in the Bombay  , which is hearing petitions filed by the Association of Hospitals in Pune. 

 The AHP submitted a note before a division bench of Justice Naresh Patil and Justice Girish Kulkarni containing its suggestions. One of the primary recommendations is to exclude   surgeries from the purview of the IPF scheme.
 
 The bench asked the state government to look into the issues raised by the petitioners but emphasised that the primary aim is to ensure that poor patients get treatment. 
 
 “We want the benefits of the scheme to reach the real needy patients,” said Justice Patil. “Today medical costs are very high. Streamline the scheme so it operates smoothly for both (patients and hospitals).”
 
 The court asked the state to seek reports from the charity commissioner’s offices in various regions to look at the IPF functioning. The bench asked government pleader Abhinandan Vagyani to compile a report for the court so that the scheme is implemented effectively.
 
 Under the scheme, charitable hospitals are required to keep 10% of their beds for treatment of patients from the indigent section of society and an additional 10% for patients from weaker sections. The treatment expenses for such patients have to be met from the fund created by the hospitals by earmarking 2% of their total gross billing in a separate account. 
 
 In its note, the association sought “exclusion as far as transplant of organs is concerned, because the limit prescribed by the scheme will be exhausted. A large class which is genuinely in need of benefits of the scheme will be deprived of it”.
