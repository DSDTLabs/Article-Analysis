HYDERABAD: Senior   leader and former Union minister   on Sunday dubbed the demonetisation of old   as 'remonetisation' as the Centre failed to dig out the black money.

 Addressing the   (TPCC) here, Chidambaram said every Rupee of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore worth currency demonetised on November 8 last year had come back to the   (RBI). The Centre failed to achieve the very purpose of withdrawing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. He said what the Centre has been doing is not 'notebandi` but 'notebadli'.
 
 The withdrawn money is now being remonetised through new currency . He said the Modi government must have consulted “some RSS pracharak“ before withdrawing the old notes as it did not consult those who should have been consulted. He said many former governors of the apex bank have found fault with the Centre's move. “We had Raghuram Rajan as RBI governor for three years. He did not think demonetisation was the answer. But new RBI governor Urjit Patel had agreed to demonetisation just 64 days after assuming the office,“ Chidambaram said.
