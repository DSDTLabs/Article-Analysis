VIJAYAWAD: Scores of colourful, cultural paintings have given a virtually makeover to   railway station.

 These artworks adorn walls at nondescript locations which earlier lacked colour. In fact, these pieces are now serving as an excellent background for taking selfies. In total, 42 paintings were commissioned, of which 36 were completed. The excruciatingly extensive works were undertaken by four young freelance artists from the city at a reasonable fee.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Vijayawada station director Chimata   said, “We selected the paintings based on some designs they showed us. We picked the ones which exemplified the region’s distinctive character.” These art pieces can be found near the East Booking Office -1 and 2. All of them have come up in the last two months.
 
 From sankranti celebrations to Kuchipudi dance poses, the paintings go big on Andhra Pradesh’s cultural heritage. A tribute to the famous Kondapalli toys are also part of the assemblage. Famous persons like Sattiraju Lakshmi Narayana alias Bapu’s have also inspired some of the works. While one may spot paintings on the walls, the ceiling too holds some impressive, eye-catching works.
 
 Officials hope this initiative will discourage the public from spitting on the walls as they believe ‘no one would have the heart to do so’.
 
 “There are another six paintings that need to be finished. We expect them to be completed soon,” Suresh added. The entire idea of putting up thematic paintings has a Swacch Bharat angle to it as they will help beautify the premises one of India’s oldest rail stations.
