CHANDIGARH: The Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) has pointed out poor implementation of the central government’s flagship scheme Swachh Bharat Mission in   by the SAD-BJP government between 2014 and 2017.

 In its recent report tabled in the Punjab assembly last week, the CAG has highlighted, “State’s Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) was not set up as per guidelines.” The auditors pointed out that the SAD-BJP government lacked formal mechanism for coordination between different departments. Against the available funds of Rs 37.33 crore with respect to SBM (urban), only Rs 18.24 crore (49%) were released by the Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company (PMIDC) to 163 urban local bodies till March 2017.
  
  
 It has also come to fore that neither a dedicated person was neither appointed at the state level nor at the district level to identify corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects to construct toilets as required under the guidelines.
 
 The report says Punjab had taken up   under which urban areas would have been made open defecation free by October 2, 2019, and rural areas by December 31, 2017. But the auditors found as on March 2017, that individual household latrines for 94,353 (83%) households and 1,146 community toilets or public toilets (100%) under SBM (urban) and similar latrines for 2,14,647 households in rural areas of Punjab were yet to be constructed despite availability of funds.
 
 “Thus, the target of making the state open defecation free by October 2, 2019, and December 31, 2017 in rural and urban areas, respectively, appear to be hard to achieve,” says the report. The CAG has referred all the shortcomings to the state government in May 2017, but till November 2017, the state government failed to file its reply to the CAG. Scrutiny of the records also revealed that though the scheme was launched in October 2014 and 1,85,204 latrines had been constructed in rural areas, however, no evaluation study had been conducted in the state to review the implementation of the scheme and initiate course of corrections in areas which required improvement.
 
 The audit report also points out that records of the PMIDC showed that in May 2017 18,671 of the 20,375 beneficiaries across the state who had completed the construction of these latrines till May 2017 were denied the benefit of second instalment amounting to Rs 3,333 each, which comes to a total of Rs 6.22 crore. Auditors have also highlighted that the PMIDC also issued incorrect utilization certificates of funds to the central government for the amount released as it was not as per the actual expenditure incurred by the urban local bodies.
 
 The CAG’s study was based on the audit conducted to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of the mission in urban areas from December 2016 to May 2017 by checking records maintained by the PMIDC and 11 of the 164 urban local bodies were selected. These were Amritsar, Bathinda, Chauke, Fatehgarh Churian, Mandi Gobindgarh, Kharar, Lohiankhas, Moonak, Nihal Singh Wala, Rayya and Zirakpur. In rural areas, an audit was conducted by checking records for the period 2014-17 of Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Patiala, Mohali and Muktsar districts.
