PATNA: An irate mob blocked Laxmi Chowk locality under Bramhapura police station area in   for several hours on Sunday after a murder convict Sher Singh Rana was allegedly felicitated in a programme organised to observe the 160th anniversary of Veer Kunwar Singh’s victory against the British army, on Sunday. 

 Rana was the only accused who was convicted for life in Phoolan Devi murder case in August 2014 and is currently on bail granted by the Delhi high court in December 2016. Phoolan was assassinated outside her official residence in New Delhi in July 2001.
 
 Bramhapura police station SHO Rajeshwar Prasad said the programme was held on the premises of police lines under Ahiyapur police station area. He said the ground was hired by the organisers of the programme.
 
 “The agitators from several groups blocked the roundabout for at least two hours disrputing traffic movement,” said the SHO.
 
 Sources said supporters of Bhim Sena, Nishad Manch and RJD were involved in the agitation. Muzaffarpur DM Dharmendra Kumar said prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC were already promulgated by the district administration to stop Rana from attending the programme. “The organisers had sought prior permission from the district administration to organise the programme. However, on getting information about Rana’s presence in the programme, the organisers were asked to stop him,” said the DM.He said that a DSP rank officer was sent to the spot, who removed the person from the stage whom people identified as Rana. “He had hardly attended the programme for five minutes,” he said.
 
 The DM also said that an FIR will be lodged in this connection with the Ahiyapur police station and the matter is being probed.
