Chandigarh: In a step to check the environmental pollution because of the crop residue burning, the Congress government in its second budget on Saturday allocated Rs 100 crore for the straw management programme. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said the state had designed a practical and achievable action plan for crop residue management and an outlay of Rs 100 crore has been earmarked for 2018-19.

 Punjab produces around 20 million tonne of paddy residue every year but hardly around four million tonne of this is utilised through alternative methods like for fuel in brick kilns, biogas plants and boiler furnaces. In its last year budget, the Punjab government had allocated Rs 5 crore for a paddy straw management challenge fund for innovation and to identify new technologies. To encourage and reward village panchayats to stop burning of paddy straw, the state government in its last year budget had allocated Rs 20 crore.
 
 The finance minister said on Saturday in the budget speech that the state government has made it mandatory to attach Super Straw Management System (SMS) with self-propelled combine harvester. He added that the government has also taken an initiative to provide the requisite machinery to tackle the problem of stubble burning through its primary agriculture cooperative societies. This machinery is available to the farmers on custom hiring basis at reasonable rates.
 
 He told the state assembly on Saturday that due to consistent efforts of the state government and farmersâ€™ support, the burning of paddy straw has come down to 62% of the paddy sown area during Kharif-2017 as compared to 85% during the same period in 2016.
