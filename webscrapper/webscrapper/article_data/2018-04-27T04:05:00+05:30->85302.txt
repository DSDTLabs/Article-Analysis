Vadodara: There is no respite for Bhayli residents from vehicle thefts. 

 After stealing 16 two-wheelers within a fortnight from the parking of high-end apartments in Bhayli and little action by Vadodara rural police, the gang involved in all these incidents have gone a step further by stealing six more motorcycles including bikes like a Royal Enfield, Yamaha FZS and a Pulsar RS200 in a single night.
 
 Rajendra Punjabi, a bank executive living in Ashoka Flats, approached Vadodara taluka police station along with five other residents of the residential complex with his complaint on Wednesday. Punjabi said that on April 23 morning when he was going out, he could not find his bike in the parking of all towers of the complex. After few hours, five other residents – Amit Singh, Shailesh Jethwa, Pavan Bindacharya, Bipin Dhaduk and Sandeep Singh – also learnt that their bikes were also missing.
 
 Later, the residents saw that their bikes were also stolen in a similar way like others in the previous incidents had gone missing. They found that fence on one of the compound walls was cut and the thieves had stolen the bikes by lifting them and passing it across the wall.
 
 The bike thefts of April 23, takes the total number of bikes stolen to 22 from Bhayli alone. After a dozen bikes had gone missing, the residents had themselves taken to patrolling in the night as they complained that the vigil by rural police is not enough. The residents also blame absence of streetlights in their area which is giving a free hand to this gang. 
 
 After a meeting of residents on April 15, the sarpanch of Bhayli village had promised to install streetlights, which is actually the responsibility of Vadodara Urban Development Authority. (VUDA).
