BIHARSHARIF: Three minor children of an auto driver died allegedly after consuming contaminated food at Golapur village under Deepnagar police station area in Nalanda district on Tuesday.

 The auto driver, Chotila Yadav, in his police complaint had stated that his children Nisha Kumari (6), Shankar Kumar (4) and Raushan Kumar (7) had ‘chapati’ and ‘sabzi’ in breakfast around 9 am. Soon after finishing breakfast, they complained of stomach ache and within half-an-hour they fainted, following which they were immediately rushed to Biharsharif sadar hospital.
 
 While Nisha and Shankar died soon after being admitted to hospital, their third sibling Raushan died near Harnaut, when he was being taken to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).
 
 Angry relatives and other villagers blocked Biharsharif-Ekangarsarai NH-81 for over two hours and agreed to lift it only after the officials assured them of adequate compensation.
 
 Deepnagar PS SHO Rahul Kumar said an FIR was lodged in this connection and added that the exact cause of death would be known only after postmortem reports. The police officer also said that action will be initiated on the basis of findings of the autopsy report expected to come in two days. TNN
