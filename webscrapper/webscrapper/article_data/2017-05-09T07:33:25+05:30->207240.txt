LUDHIANA: A 22-year-old labourer was found dead at his rented accommodation in Thareeke village early on Monday morning. 

 Even as the police suspected it to be a case of suicide, with  ' body hanging from a ceiling grill, his family alleged that he was murdered. Seeking arrest of his employer, milk vendor Baljinder Singh, the family, along with about 70 labourers, staged a protest outside the office of police commissioner R N Dhoke. 
 
 Das, a resident of   village, Ludhiana district, had been living in the house of Singh at   in Thareeke village from the past two years. "On Monday morning, when I went to Das' room to wake him up, I found him hanging from the ceiling grill. I immediately called up the police and Das' parents," said Singh. 
 
 Das' mother,  , however, said, "Singh came to our house and asked us to accompany him, saying Das is unwell. When we reached his house, we found Das dead. Police, too, were present there." 
 
 Crying murder, she added, "Singh has killed my son. Das used to deposit his salary with Singh as he planed to buy land. Some days ago, he had sought the money he had been saving with him for the past two years. But Singh killed him and hanged his body from the grill to make it look like a suicide. He should be charged with murder." . 
 
  Sadar police station SHO   said, "When the police reached the spot, the youth was hanging from the grill. Prima facie, it appears to be a suicide case. The post-mortem examination report will clear the picture." 
 
 The protesters lifted the blockade after two hours when police recorded the statements of Das' family. His family has threatened to hit the roads again if police failed to act against the accused.
