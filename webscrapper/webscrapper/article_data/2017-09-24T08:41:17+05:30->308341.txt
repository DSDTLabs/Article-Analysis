LUCKNOW:   national president   said on Saturday he had the blessings of his father   and that he would do whatever it takes to make the party face the challenges at hand. He assured party workers that Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) was with the party. 

 This was the first time that   and his younger brother Shivpal were not present at the party’s state convention, as they were not invited.
 
 In political circles, Akhilesh’s comment was seen as clear indication that he was in no mood to allow Mulayam to take over the reins of the party again. There are speculations that Mulayam will announce a new party in the near future if he remains sidelined and is not allowed a place of authority in SP. 
 
 During a recent meeting of the Lohia Trust, headed by Mulayam and his younger brother Shivpal as president and secretary, respectively, Mulayam said he would address a press conference on September 25 to announce his strategy.
 
 Some senior SP leader described Akhilesh’s comment as an attempt to counter the narrative that the family feud was a major reason for SP’s humiliating defeat in the 2017 assembly polls. 
 
 “Netaji had floated SP and it is now our responsibility to take it ahead,”   said, adding, “I can tell you that Netaji’s blessings are with us and will always be,” said Akhilesh. 
 
 Akhilesh lambasted the BJP government for misguiding people in the name of demonetisation and said the manner in which GST had been introduced had led to loss of jobs and inconvenience to traders. Senior SP leader Naresh Agarwal went on to promise the trader community that the SP, when it forms government in UP, will abolish GST.
