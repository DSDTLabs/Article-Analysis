NEW  : Though over one   truck   have been booked till date this year, it seems to hardly act as a deterrent for heavy vehicles turning into killer monsters on the city roads after a customary check at the border posts.

 A traffic police survey shows that trucks account for over 70% of deaths on the roads past midnight. The most vulnerable stretches are Ring Road, Outer Ring Road and Mathura Road. It was found that 57.1% of all deaths by heavy vehicles were pedestrians. Also, 59.2% of heavy vehicles were registered in Haryana.
 
 Only 2% of the vehicles entering the city can be stopped and checked thoroughly for fitness , that too at selected places due to the shortage of staffers at night.
 
 K K Kapila from   said that lack of an integrated checking policy has resulted in untrained drivers being at the wheels of these vehicles.
 
 Traffic experts said the only solution to this mess is alternative roads to divert heavy vehicles away from city. “There is no accountability of the drivers, unless the owners or people who hire them are held accountable for their illegal acts,” said SP Singh, fellow of Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training.
