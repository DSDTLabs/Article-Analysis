AHMEDABAD:Gujarat’s Commissionerate of Food and   Administration (FDCA) has now begun taking samples of ayurvedic medicines, mainly involving bhasmas (powder) from various ayurvedic pharmacies in the state. The samples will be tested for heavy metal content. 

 Instructions were passed to various regional offices of the FDCA last week for collection of samples. 
 
 Food and drugs commissioner   confirmed the move.
 
 The FDCA will test these samples at   which are equipped with atomic absorption spectrometers.
 
 Last week the FDCA had tested six samples of   provided by TOI. The authority found lead levels which were 2,660 times higher than   given in Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) standards. The arsenic content in another set of medicines was found to be 1,286 times higher than the permissible limit. 
 
 Four of the six samples collected had failed the heavy metal tests according to FDCA. 
 
 “We have already started collecting samples of ayurvedic medicines that involve bhasmas (powder). If the Rasa Shastras or the traditional method of preparing the bhasmas is followed by the letter, then there are no chances of heavy metal traces in ayurvedic medicines,” Koshia said. “It is when pharmacies violate the methods that heavy metal compounds are found in the ayurvedic medicines,” Koshia added.
