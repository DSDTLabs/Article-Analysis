RANCHI: A   at   on Wednesday, demanding justice for  ,   and  . 

 Priya (name changed), who belongs to Sisai village, was duped by a neighbour who took her to Delhi where he tried to rape her.
 
 Narrating her story, Priya said, “I was planning to go to picnic with my sister on January 1 but our mother stopped us from going. I got angry and walked out of the house and reached Gumla town.”
 
 On reaching the town she came across a neighbour, Azhar, who told her that her mother had called him up and asked him to take her home.
 
 “We do not speak to him in the village so I doubted his intentions but he promised to take me to my mother. However, he said he needs to get some work done first and I should accompany him,” Priya said.
 
 Once Priya was convinced, Azhar took her to Chandwa block in Latehar district and from there to Tori station.
 
 “On reaching the station, I sensed something was amiss and started protesting. He gave me water to drink after which I blacked out,” she said. Priya gained consciousness only when the train had left Tori station.
 
 “I wanted to protest but then he showed me a vulgar video of mine that he had made while I was unconscious and threatened that if I created a ruckus, he would make the video viral and send it to my family members,” Priya said.
 
 On reaching Delhi, Azhar took Priya to a house and tried to rape her but Priya managed to escape and came across one Mukesh who gave her shelter and called up her parents who went to Delhi and got her home. 
 
 She said, “He had been threatening me over the phone since then that if I say anything to anyone, he would make my video viral. I am not scared, I want justice.”
