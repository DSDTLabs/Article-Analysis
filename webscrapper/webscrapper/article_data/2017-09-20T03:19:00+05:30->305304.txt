Saligao: Rural development agency (RDA) minister and Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar, on Tuesday, visited an anganwadi in Saligao to get a first-hand experience of its functioning. He was accompanied by members of the Saligao panchayat.  TOI observed that the anganwadi was in a dilapidated condition with no proper seating arrangements for students. It was also noticed that basic facilities such as electricity, water supply and a kitchen were also missing. Speaking to reporters, Salgaonkar said, “Balwadis require basic facilities such as electricity, water, and a kitchen. But, these are missing at most balwadis in Saligao. I promise to provide all the basic needs for the children studying at these balwadis to ensure their smooth functioning.” He promised to undertake painting and provide a kitchen. “I also plan to develop an open hall by providing a library, where senior citizens can read newspapers and magazines. We are also deciding to provide breakfast for students under the UMID scheme and to provide sports facilities such as table tennis, badminton and carrom where children can spend their recreational time,” Salgaonkar said.
