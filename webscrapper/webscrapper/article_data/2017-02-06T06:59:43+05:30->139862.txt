 This month's event featured only women artists. 
 
 "We usually have a mixed group of artists for the show, but during one of the committee meetings, someone suggested we have a woman-only event," explained Bhavani G S, artist and organizer of this month's event.
 
 The artists are given sheets to draw/paint on. Visitors could then buy these paintings for a fixed rate of Rs 1,000. Proceeds from the sale of the first painting go to the  . After that, 10% of all sales proceeds go towards the foundation, with the artists retaining the rest. Artists can also sell their other works at the event. Nearly 20 paintings were sold on Sunday, raising about Rs 60,000.
 
 "People don't usually go to art galleries, and even if they do, they don't end up meeting the artists. Through the Artpark, we encourage people to acquire art and also interact with the artists," said S G Vasudev, veteran artist and initiater of Artpark.
 
 "This is a really great initiative. I didn't think it was possible for artworks to be this affordable," said Priya R, a visitor at the event.
