MUMBAI/PUNE: A day after a bandh called by Dalit outfits crippled parts of  , an all-India student summit to be addressed by   politician   and student activist   had to be called off in Mumbai on Thursday with police detaining the organisers, students and guests, including MLC Kapil Patil. 

 Mevani, a new MLA, and JNU student leader   were also booked by Pune cops for making inflammatory and provocative statements during the Elgar Parishad at Shaniwarwada on December 31, a day before violence broke out at Koregaon Bhima. The action came on a police complaint lodged on Wednesday by a 22-year-old student. 
 
 Khalid, who had been charged with sedition along with other JNU students, including Kanhaiya Kumar, in 2016, was to speak at noon in the 35th edition of the annual all-India summit organised by Chhatra Bharati Vidyarthi at Bhaidas hall in Vile Parle (W) on Thursday, and Mevani at the concluding ceremony. Patil was scheduled to felicitate him. But it all ended in chaos with cops detaining up to 112 people. They were all released later in the evening.
 
 The organisers of the all-India student summit at Juhu had sent a letter to police on December 29, saying Dalit politician Jignesh Mevani and student activist Umar Khalid would be participating. But police sent a notice refusing permission on Wednesday, citing the statewide bandh. Around 10am on Thursday, a police force arrived with barricades at the hall and asked everybody to leave. 
 
 Those who refused to do so were taken to police stations. In Pune, additional commissioner of police (south region) Ravindra Sengaonkar explained the late action saying police were busy on New Year’s Eve and the next three days to avert any untoward incident over the Koregaon Bhima incident. The police and civic body had given permissions for the ‘Elgar Parishad’.
