BENGALURU: With water levels in   (KRS) and   plummeting to a new low, the government is thinking of utilizing water from the dead storage level in the event of a   in Bangalore and Mysuru during peak summer. 

 Water resources minister M B   on Tuesday said it would become inevitable to draw water from dead storage of up to 5 tmcft to tackle the possible crisis in both cities. He ruled out water rationing as of now.
 
  Patil said storage in KRS and Kabini reservoirs was 18-20 tmcft; while live storage was around 10 tmcft, the remaining was dead storage (8.2tmcft).The storage level drastically reduced in KRS following deficit rainfall and release of water to Tamil Nadu. 
 
  While the dam's maximum capacity is 124.8 ft, storage has reduced to 80 ft. With summer expected to be severe this year because of less rainfall over the last two months, officials said water level is expected to dip further, with a deficit of 2-3 tmcft during summer. They said 1.5 tmcft of water is r equired every month to ensure adequate supply to Bangalore and 0.5 tmcft for Mysuru. 
 
  In the event of a crisis, the minister said machines would be used to lift water from the dead storage level in the two reservoirs without harming aquatic life. At the same time, he allayed fears of severe water scarcity. 
 
  "There is sufficient water to meet drinking requirements for summer. There is no need to panic,'' Patil added. 
 
 He urged people to judiciously use water supplied to their homes and ensure there is no crisis.
