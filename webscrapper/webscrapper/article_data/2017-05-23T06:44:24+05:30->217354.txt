 Ansari, who was arrested by a team of cyber cell of crime branch from Jharkhand, had told the investigators that he had called up around 17,000 people across the country, with Gujarat topping the list with 4,458 calls.
 
 “Ansari has learnt the tricks of the trade from one Tiku Mandal of Panchsimi village located in the same district. Mandal gave tips to 14 more cheats like Ansari,” said assistant commissioner of police, crime branch, Rajdeepsinh Zala.
 
 “Just imagine if Ansari alone had called up 17,000 people, how many calls these 14 cheats have made and the amount they have siphoned off from bank accounts of people who fell in their traps. Mandal took Rs 70,000 from each member of gang for giving them training, opening bank accounts and arranging dummy sim cards. Mandal used to get the money transferred to his bank accounts from e-wallets of his gang members and in return would give cash after deducting his commission,” Zala added.

 “We are working in co-ordination with Jharkhand police to nab Mandal. We are also in the process of contacting those who have been contacted by the   to get their complaints registered,” said Zala.
 
 Ansari used to call people posing as a bank official and fraudulently collect their card and CVV numbers. He then used to siphon off money or do online transactions.
