PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Even as   collection resumed after four days in   on Monday, heaps of waste scattered on roads and open spaces continued to be an eyesore.

 The garbage crisis in the area began after the neighbouring   village stopped the previous contractor from dumping garbage in its limits last Thursday. Around 10-12 tonnes of garbage is generated in the village daily, which excludes that from hotels. Nearly 50,000 residents were affected by it.
 
 DD Bhojane, village development officer, Hinjewadi gram panchayat told TOI, “We held a meeting of the gram panchayat on Monday and directed the previous contractor (of 2015-16) to deploy additional strength to clear the piling garbage. He has deployed two additional tractors and more manpower to transport the same.”
 
 He added, “As a result, door-to-door garbage collection was dedicated three extra hours. Around 50-60% of the garbage piled along the roads and in open spaces has been cleared. We hope to clear the remaining heaps tomorrow (Tuesday).”
 
 Digvijay Hulawale, a local resident said, “If the garbage is not cleared soon, it may decompose due to the rains and pose health issues for local residents. The contractor’s men informed us that the piles will be cleared in two days.”
