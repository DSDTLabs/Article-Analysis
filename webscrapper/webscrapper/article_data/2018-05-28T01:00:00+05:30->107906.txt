 When we asked Rohitash about it, he said, “Apart from being presented as Tarzan, I will also have a tribal look. It’s the first time in the show that we have taken such a look. This was probably the most fun sequence for the entire cast. There are a lot of twists and turns in this story and the viewers are truly going to enjoy this episode.”
 Aasif added, “It’s a real fun sequence. Our out-of-the-box avatars and the story revolving around the characters will have the viewers rolling with laughter. It’s the first time that you will see us all in this tribal look and every bit of the shooting has been fun. We have some exciting episodes coming out post IPL final and this will surely keep the viewers hooked.”
