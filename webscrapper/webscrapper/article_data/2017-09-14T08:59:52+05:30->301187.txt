AMRITSAR: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Kirpal Singh Badungar has condemned the   government’s decision to ban kirpan, one of the five articles of the Sikh faith, stating that it was violation of Article 25 of the Constitution that gives everyone freedom to practice one’s religion.

 “It’s highly condemnable decision of the Karnataka government. Kirpan is an integral part of the Sikh religion and Sikhs have the freedom to wear it across the nation,” he said adding that the ban should be revoked immediately.
 
 Badungar also appealed to the Centre and the   government to seriously consider the Karnataka government’s step which had alienated the Sikhs in their own country. “Soon a delegation of the SGPC will meet the Karnataka government and will also write to Prime Minister   to intervene in the issue,” he said.
 
 Stating that Sikhs had laid maximum lives for the freedom of India, Badungar said issuing such directions was a blot on Indian democracy and asked the Karnataka government to immediately rescind the kirpan ban directions.
 
 On August 28, the Karnataka government issued an order imposing a ban on carrying kirpans, khukris, machetes, swords without licence, as specified in category V of the Schedule I of the Arms Rules of 2016, in public places under the Bengaluru jurisdiction.
 
 Additional chief secretary (home)   had said that Sikhs would not be affected as they were protected under other state laws.
