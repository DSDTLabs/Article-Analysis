PATNA: The   ( ) will conduct the half-yearly examinations for Class I to VIII from September 11 to 16 in government and government-aided schools across the state.

 The students will write examinations of all subjects carrying 50 marks each. The council is of the view that half-yearly examination will inculcate a sense of competitiveness and end examination fear in students studying under the state board.
 
 State project director   said the question paper and answer sheet for Class II to VIII would be given to the district education officers (DEOs) before the exams. “Class I students will only appear for the oral exam while others will give written exams. No student will be detained because the assessment is to judge their performance. Weak students sorted out through the half-yearly exam would be given special classes,” he said. The answer sheets will be evaluated at the cluster resource centre and block resource centre. Students will get grading A, B, C and D — A being the best. 
 
 To discuss the performance of the students, the schools will also conduct parents-teachers meeting. “If the parents are not satisfied with the performance of their wards, they could choose to detain the children in the same class after the annual exam,” said Singh. 
 
 This initiative of monthly, half-yearly and annual examinations was taken by the education board in March 2016 after the international organizations report indicated that only 42% of the students in Class V could read the education material of Class II level. It also pointed out that subject-wise, students’ performance in mathematics was dipping over the period of time in Bihar. However, the state education department had conducted only annual exam last year but now it has decided to take half- yearly exam as well.
