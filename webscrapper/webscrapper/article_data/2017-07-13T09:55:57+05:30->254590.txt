CHANDIGARH: A big relief from the heat but it’s difficult to say if   is welcome. The arriving of the long-awaited rains slowed down all traffic and created logjams.

 Water collected near various drains in Sectors 8, 26, 18, 15, and 16, besides the Industrial Area and the southern Sectors of 44, 45, 46 and 47. Since it rained in the morning hours, people were stuck on their way to the office. “As the roads got flooded, traffic slowed down everywhere. It took me an hour to reach office, and I got late,” said Raman of Mohali, who travels to workin  .
 
 Mohan Sharma of Sector 15 said: “An hour’s rain is enough to flood the Chandigarh roads. Every monsoon, we face the same problem in many parts of the city. The municipal corporation should find a solution.” Mayor Asha Jaswal said: “We’ll make a plan to avoid water accumulation during monsoon but I advise all hoteliers and dhaba owners not to dump their kitchen waste into in storm-water drains. Clear drains will give an easy passage to rainwater.”
