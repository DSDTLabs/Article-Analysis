Kanpur has been getting its share of rains, but to further heighten the excitement, a club in the city recently organised a   party for its members.   and his wife Rachana played perfect hosts and welcomed the guests at the do. "Like every year, this time too our rain dance party is to entertain all our friends. I am happy that all our members are having a good time," said Atul. 
Monika came with her friends and family to enjoy the do. Nidhi and Manya were the first ones to step onto the dance floor.   played tracks like 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani', 'Baarish Ka Bahana Hai', 'Chhai Chappa Chhai' and 'Barso Re Megha Megha' to set the mood of the guests. Brig BM Sharma, Suman, Ashish, Randeep, Sanjay and Sunaina were spotted having a great time dancing. Meanwhile, Veena, Nitin, Ankita and Raman chose to socialize with friends.
