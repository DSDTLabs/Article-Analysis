CHENNAI: The AIADMK government defended the arrest of   vice-chancellor A Ganapathi on corruption charges. The VC was arrested in Coimbatore on Saturday after he was found allegedly receiving money.

 Deputy chief minister O   said there was no second opinion on taking action against officials found to be corrupt.
 
 “It has been the policy of AIADMK founder   as well as former chief minister   that the corrupt should not go scot-free. The same policy is being followed by the present government,” Panneerselvam told reporters.
 
 He said the AIADMK is following the ideals of former chief minister and DMK founder C N Annadurai and refuted DK leader K Veeramani’s charges that Anna lives only in AIADMK flag. “Veeramani is a respectable person, but all his views cannot be accepted. AIADMK is following the path shown by Anna to serve the poor and the downtrodden,” said Panneerselvam.
 
 The deputy chief minister, who is also coordinator of AIADMK’s steering committee, refuted charges that his supporters were not invited to the district secretaries’ meeting held in the city on Friday. “Only party office-bearers connected to the meeting were invited and there is no truth in the charge that a few of them were not invited,” said Panneerselvam.
