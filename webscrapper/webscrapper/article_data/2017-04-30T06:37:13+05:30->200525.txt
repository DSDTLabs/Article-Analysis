NEW DELHI: Former   T P   moved the Supreme Court on Saturday seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against state chief secretary Nalini Netto for not issuing official orders reappointing him as DGP as directed by the apex court. 

 The Supreme Court had on April 24 held that the Kerala government’s decision to sack Senkumar from his post was illegal and directed the state government to reinstate him. The court had said there was no justifiable reason on part of the state government to remove him from the post. 
 
 As official letter for his reinstatement has not been issued so far, Senkumar filed a contempt petition in SC accusing the chief secretary of not complying with the SC’s order. He termed Netto’s alleged reluctance to issue orders to reinstate him as “wilful and deliberate disobedience” of the court. 
 
 In his petition, filed through advocate Haris Beeran, Senkumar said he had written to the chief secretary the very next day after the SC verdict and followed it up shortly with a second letter with a certified copy of the court’s order. He said no step had been taken so far for his reinstatement. 
 
 "The contemnor is conscious of the fact that once this court closes for summer recess on 9th May 2017, it reopens only on 3rd July, 2017 which will make the petitioner remedyless and thus frustrate the judgement of this court,” Senkumar said in his petition. He said his retirement is due in over a month’s time and the state government was intentionally delaying his reinstatement.
