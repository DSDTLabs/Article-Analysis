LUCKNOW: Several clerics from across the country on Wednesday condemned UP   chairperson Waseem Rizvi’s letter to the PM urging him to shut down madrassas while accusing the institutes of preparing terrorists.

 Both Shia and Sunni clerics demanded that the state government, to whom Rizvi has also sent the letter, take action against Rizvi for inciting hatred. The clerics also warned of a protest from Lucknow to Delhi if the government failed to act.
 
 General secretary of the national level body of clerics, Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind (MUH), Maulana Kalbe Jawad demanded Rizvi’s arrest. He said such blatant allegations against madrassas could lead to communal flare up in UP. “Not just clerics, but the entire Shia community condemns Waseem Rizvi’s baseless allegations against madrassas where he has said that the institutes radicalise Indian Muslims. The man is corrupt and many of his cases have been proved, yet the state government is not taking any action against him. Why is the UP government letting him go?” Jawad said.
 
 Jawad said, “If he says madrassas produce terrorists, then for the past five years terrorists were being produced under former UP minorities minister  . Rizvi being silent in those five years means he was involved in the crime of terror making.”
 
 Imam of the Aishbagh Eidgah and president of the Islamic India Centre, Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali said, “All his allegations are baseless and have been made by him to evade probes. Madrassas are places where Quran, Hadith and religious teachings are taught, and by calling them hubs of terrorism, There should be legal action against him immediately.”
 
 Shia cleric and president of Shia Markazi Chand Committee, Maulana Saif Abbas, said madrassas teach love and it was wrong for anyone to point fingers against them. He said, “The education imparted in madrassas is that of nation building, of binding the communities together and not of dividing them.”
