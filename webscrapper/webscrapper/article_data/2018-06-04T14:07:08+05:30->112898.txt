TRICHY: Tamil people should thank Prime Minister   for resolving the   issue, as he found a solution to the century-old problem, said union minister   Radhakrishnan at Mannargudi on Sunday. Speaking to reporters after congratulating the general secretary of Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association Mannargudi   at his house, he recalled the continuous efforts taken by the farmers’ leader in his lifetime for constituting the Cauvery Management Authority.

 While lauding Mannargudi Ranganathan for his tireless efforts for the cause of farming community in delta districts, Radhakrishnan added that Ranganathan has been working for the community for the past 35 years. He was the first to file a petition on the Cauvery issue.
 
 Earlier, the minister felicitated Ranganathan with garland and a shawl and held discussions with him. Elaborating on the discussion he had with the minister, Ranganathan expressed his gratitude to the Centre for finding a solution for the long-pending Cauvery water issue. 
 
 However, without the series of protests and agitations staged by the entire farming community, this success could not have been attained, he opined. “I discussed various issues with the minister including mobilising the farming community for getting things done from both the state and central governments which would benefit farmers,” he added.
 
 Party functionaries including state general secretary Karuppu Muruganantham, Tiruvarur district BJP president Pettai Siva were also present during the meeting.
