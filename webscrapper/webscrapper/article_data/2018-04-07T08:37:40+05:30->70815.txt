CHANDIGARH:  , 18, who won a bronze in the 69kg category, comes from a family of farmers in Haryana. He is a native of Shadipur village where his father Bijender Lather is a farmer and has an acre of land where he grows wheat, mustard and fodder for the three cows he owns.

 
 “Deepak was strong even as a child. He ploughed our fields for long hours and used to lift sacks of fodder. Those were very heavy sacks and I thought he should become a wrestler,” Bijender recalled. 
 
 Since Shadipur didn’t have a gym, Deepak could neither pursue wrestling or weightlifting.
 
 
 
 In 2008, he impressed during a series of trials conducted across Haryana by the Army Sports Institute (ASI) and was admitted to ASI, Pune. Interestingly, initially, he was trained as a diver. As it turned out, Deepak was disinterested in diving and found his calling when he was re-assigned to be a lifter. 
 
 “The coaches told him diving is not for rigid bodies of Haryana. They are meant for tough stuff like wrestling, weightlifting,” he said, “Our yields only ensured that my family could survive. It was very demanding to support his (Deepak) sporting career. But once the Army Sports Institute came in, we didn’t have to worry.”
