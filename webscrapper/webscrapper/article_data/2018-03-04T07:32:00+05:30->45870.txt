CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   on Saturday countered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that   didn’t give him “respect”, saying it was part of the BJP’s “pointless attempts to create a wedge between him and the party leadership”.

 Earlier on Saturday, Modi had said, “In Punjab, Congress does not even consider the CM as its own. He marches on, like an independent solider.” Modi was speaking at the BJP headquarters in Delhi following the party’s resounding victory in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland elections. 
 
 Countering Modi, Amarinder said, “I don’t remember complaining to him against the Congress high command. Did the high command go and complain to him against me?” The chief minister further added, “One really fails to understand what prompted Modi’s ill-conceived and unfounded remark.” He further asserted neither he nor the Congress high command needed Modi’s advice on how to manage their internal relations. 
 
 The Punjab chief minister further added that the Congress high command had full faith in his leadership and had given him a free hand to bring Punjab out of the mess into which the BJP, in alliance with SAD, had plunged it in. “I know my business and I know how to run my state and manage my relationship with my party high command, which is more than one can say about the BJP leaders,” said Amarinder.
 
 The chief minister added, “I am personally set to take this battle to the finish, Mr. Modi.” He went on to claim that Modi’s ‘jumlebaazi’ would not have any impact either on the Congress leadership and workers, or people of the country. He said the Congress was not a fly-by-night party which he could simply wish away contrary to what the Prime Minister would like to believe. Amarinder declared Congress was completely ready under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi to take on the BJP in the 2019 parliamentary elections.
