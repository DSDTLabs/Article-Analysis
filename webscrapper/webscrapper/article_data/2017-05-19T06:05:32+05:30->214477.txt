INDORE:  's will doesn't even cover a third of his official note pad. Dated July 23, 2012, the typed note in Hindi, with patches of his handwriting, asks that no memorial, statue, award or competition be held in his memory. 

 The note reflects both his simple lifestyle and the   he was known for. His wishes are simple: that he be cremated according to Vedic rites on the banks of Narmada River at   in Hoshangabad district of  .
 
 Dave, who was ailing for some time, said he did not want any lavish ceremony - just the Vedic rituals. "If anyone wants to do something in my memory, if they carry out the great work of planting trees and maintaining them, I will be pleased. In the same manner, maximum efforts can be made, as per individual potential, towards conservation of rivers and water reservoirs," he wrote in his will, adding, "While doing so, desist from using my name."
 
 The title of the note 'My wish and will' is written in English, and the rest is in Hindi. Dave, who wrote nine books in Hindi and two in English, left behind a footnote, seeking forgiveness for "deficiency in language and writing".
