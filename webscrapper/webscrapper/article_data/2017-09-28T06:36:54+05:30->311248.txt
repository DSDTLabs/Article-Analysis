SHIVAMOGGA: State BJP president B S Yeddyurappa, who had said he would contest the   from a constituency in north Karnataka, did a turnaround on Wednesday . He said he would request the party's   to give him a ticket from his  ,   in Shivamogga district.

 Yeddyurappa said the central leadership had asked him to contest from Terdal in Belagavi district, “but as Terdal is a new constituency for me, I will persuade the high command to allow me to contest from Shikaripur because even my voters don't want me to shift.“
 
 Yeddyurappa's statement surprised many in BJP circles, with some wondering if seeking a shift would not amount to going against the party diktat.Sources said speculation of RSS activist B L Santhosh, who is taking an active role in Kar nataka politics, being sounded to contest from K R Nagar constituency in Mysuru district could have prompted Yeddyu rappa's turnaround.
 
 It is well known in political circles that Yeddyurappa and Santhosh don't see eye to eye, though the former CM has tried to play down the differences between them. Santhosh, known for his organizational skills, reportedly nurses political ambitions and contributed to BJP's victory in the 2008 assembly elections.
