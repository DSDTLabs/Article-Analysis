NOIDA: Noida based builder   on Thursday said that it would deliver more than 1,000 apartments per month and 15,000 apartments by the end of 2017.

 The Supertech CMD, R K Arora, and MD   said at a press conference that they would keep their commitments on the delivery of flats on a war footing. The builder has 80,589 units to deliver and so far has handed over 30,000 units. The builder has so far either constructed — or is constructing — 17,126 apartments in Noida and 23,781 in Greater Noida.
 
 Struggling to deliver its luxury and mid-range projects, and caught in a legal web for allegedly flouting FAR norms, the Supertech top brass said on Thursday that they would “redirect their focus” towards affordable housing. They would tweak their existing projects now on the lines of Pradhan Mantra Awas Yojna or affordable housing for all by 2022.
 
 The next thrust will be in the affordable sector, and 40,000 homes in the category will be launched by the company on the lines, CMD R K Arora said. “Builders may have to push for a high-density plan in Noida and Greater Noida to accommodate more affordable housing. The permissible density in the city at present will not permit the feasibility of affordable housing, so we may push for a change.”
 
 “Instead of building two- or three-room apartments, we will now build more of single-room, basic apartments, so that first-time homebuyers can buy houses,” MD Mohit Arora said.
 
 “With a combination of pre-cast technology and the subsidies offered by for affordable housing, we can create viable housing solutions,” Mohit Arora said.
