Chandigarh: Three days into the new year, 60 people challaned for drunken driving reached the district courts complex in Sector 43 here for paying the fine. Of these, 35 violators’ licences were suspended by court. 

 In all, defaulters paid Rs 1.24 lakh in fines. The people whose licences have been suspended are either repeat offender or found to have more 350ml alcohol content in their blood when challaned. Most of these violators were challaned during the period from Christmas Eve to New Year’s Eve.
 
 Also, two traffic violators, Sabar Masih of Gurdaspur and Sunil Kumar of Mohali, were made to stand till the rising of court, as punishment along with imposition of fine. The traffic police had laid several nakas during the period from Christmas to New Year to keep a check on drunken driving. Many persons were challaned for traffic violations, which included drunken driving. It was also found that many traffic violators were from outside Chandigarh .
 
 According to Motor Vehicles (MV) Act, a person found driving drunk can be sentenced to six months in jail or fined ₹2,000 fine or both for the first offence. While there is a provision for two years in jail or ₹3,000 in fine or both for second or subsequent offence within three years of the previous offence, courts don’t usually invoke such a strict punishment. In India, the permissible blood alcohol content (BAC) is set at 0.03% per 100ml blood. That works out to be 30ml of alcohol per 100ml of blood.
