NAVI MUMBAI: The over 500 kilometres of storm water drains still have around 30% cleaning to be done while the 400-odd km of nullahs have 75% work left. Deputy municipal commissioner, (solid waste management ),   said that the deadline for cleaning the drains is May 15 and the nullah clean-up by May 25.

  The annual cleaning of the drains and nullahs is crucial to avoid flooding during the monsoon which is scheduled to arrive next month. 
 
 The rain water flows from the Parsik hills into the nullahs and drains. They are released in the holding ponds that act as a collection point to be discharged into the   creek during low tides. 
 
 Ahead of monsoons,   J D Sutar will be taking stock of the corporation’s preparedness to tackle flood like situations. The mayor has chalked out two day itinerary for inspecting the cleaning work done of the storm water drainage channels. He will visit different parts of the city on Monday and Tuesday. 
 
 The civic administration had contracted cleaning of the channels in April itself and 94 contractors were given the task to remove all trash as well as undertake de-silting of the channels. May 30 is the deadline for completing the cleaning process. 
 
 “On Monday the mayor will inspect the cleaning work undertaken in the channels that are passing through Digha and Airoli areas. On Tuesdays his visits are scheduled in Koparkhairane and Ghansoli area,” said an official.
