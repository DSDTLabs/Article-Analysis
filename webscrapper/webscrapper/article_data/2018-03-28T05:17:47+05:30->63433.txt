MUMBAI: Cracking a whip on errant stall owners in south Mumbai's popular   area, the   has served notices to 185 hawkers for violating licence conditions. 

 On March 26, the A ward office served notices to 185 stalls and is likely to propose suspension of their licences. Civic officials said this move came after repeated complaints from citizens about stall owners blocking the access to   and encroaching on footpaths. 
 
 Fashion Street is a cluster of 396 stalls on MG Road, opposite Bombay Gymkhana. Civic officials said there are multiple reasons for which a notice is usually served, including the person on whose name the licence has been issued is not present at the stall or erecting iron pipes and bamboos around the stall to display items, thus taking on excess space than permitted. 
 
 Assistant municipal commissioner   said, "We found that the hawkers had encroached on excess space. We identified the repeat offenders and served them notices." BMC found that of the 396 licences, only 30 were for stalls; the rest were pitch licences.
