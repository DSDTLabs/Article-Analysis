LUDHIANA: Giving a stark reaction to the plan of bringing in multi-crore projects by Congress leaders, the local leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Bhartiya Janta Party(BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) have declared it an agenda just to lure the voters in the upcoming MC elections. The leaders claimed, the Congress was only trying to create a wave in their favour so that they could at least visit the public seeking votes for its candidates.

 The district SAD (urban) president   said, Congress has failed to fulfil the promises which they had made at the time of assembly elections and now they are again going to make more promises. Dang said, the projects which they have proposed were announced in the SAD-BJP regime. The SAD-BJP were working on them as well. But, now the Congress leaders will try to derive credit from those projects. 
 
 Meanwhile the district BJP president   said, the major reason behind local bodies minister Navjot Sidhu delaying the elections is that the voters were turning against the congress leaders for its anti-development decisions. He said, these were the similar leaders who applied brakes on the ongoing development works under Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB). So, public can well imagine what type of development will take place in the coming years, he added.
 
 However, the state general secretary of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)   said, “It is nothing else but a ploy being played by the Congress just ahead of MC elections. The leaders will seek votes on this well-planned agenda. Once people vote in their favour, they would once again betray them like they did post-assembly elections.” While on one hand, the Congress is raising hue and cry over paucity of funds, on the other hand, they are talking of bringing projects worth crores, he commented.
