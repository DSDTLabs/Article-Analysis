LUDHIANA: Four armed goons barged into the office of an oil trader and robbed him of Rs 15 lakh in   on Thursday night. The   cameras installed near the spot have captured the robbery that was executed in 30 seconds. 

 Chandar  , a resident of  , said in his police complaint, “I have a shop in   and an office in Sabun Bazaar, about 500 metres away, where I collect cash before taking it home. Around 9.30pm on Thursday, my accountant and I were counting cash when four masked men barged in. Two were armed with guns and the other two with knives. They threatened me against raising the alarm and asked me to hand over the cash to them.”
 
 Before fleeing, the goons downed Gupta’s office shutters so that he could not chase them. Gupta then called up the police. 
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (special branch)   said, “The robbers came on two bikes. While the number plate of one of the vehicles was covered with mud, the other was without it. CCTV cameras installed in the market and the city are being scanned to trace their movement. The cyber and safe city project teams are helping solve the case.” 
 
 The police are looking into two angles. “Either the robbers did a recce before striking or it was the handiwork of someone known to Gupta who was aware that the trader collected cash at his Sabun Bazaar office.” 
 
 A case has been registered.
