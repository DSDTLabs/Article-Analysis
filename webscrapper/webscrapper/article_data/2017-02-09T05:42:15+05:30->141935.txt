AHMEDABAD: A high-level committee formed by the   met on Wednesday to discuss the implementation of   in state board-run schools. The 19-member committee recommended that   syllabus be introduced for maths, science and English subjects right from class I. The committee said the pilot project to introduce the NCERT syllabus at 57 state board-run English medium schools in the state has yielded a good response.

 So far, no decision has been taken in the matter however, all the members of the committee put forth their suggestions regarding the implementation. Members believe that this will benefit students in the long run as they will have an edge over others in competitive exams. “Before implementing the project with effect from the next academic year, a pilot project must be initiated for students of Gujarati medium. One of the major barriers for these students will be language and that needs to be addressed,” suggested one of the members. “If the implementation needs to be done as soon as the next academic year, the state textbook board must start translating books from now on. Moreover, a panel of subject experts must also be appointed to oversee this to ensure there are no mistakes or typos in the translated versions of the books,” said the member. tnn
