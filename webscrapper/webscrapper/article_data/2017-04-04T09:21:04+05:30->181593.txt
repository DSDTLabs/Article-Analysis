NAGPUR: The much awaited   round of admission   under Right to Education ( ) quota is being planned for   6, according to an official in the Nagpur education department. This round should technically have been held around March 22 itself but the local education department decided to extend the deadline for admissions because of the poor response from parents in completing   formalities. 

 RTE admission process in Nagpur district had an ironic twist starting with the admissions getting oversubscribed by over 300%. However, this statistical euphoria died down soon when the time for admissions came and only 37% of the selected parents showed up at the schools to complete admission formalities.
 
 An official told TOI a lot of parents were now coming forward to complete admission formalities. “Many parents said they had not recieved any message on mobiles about getting selected in the first round of lottery. So we had to consider their applications that ultimately led to the deadline being extended,” the official said. The deadline for completing admission formalities is now April 5. 
 
 The second round of RTE lottery, unlike the first round, will not be an elaborate affair. Back then, random numbers were chosen at a public event and were then entered into a number grid that started the lottery process. “Now the lottery will simply be generated by the software at the Pune office. Numbers chosen back then will be used as the trigger for special algorithm to start selecting students,” an official said. The entire RTE admission process is now online ensuring speedier implementation.
