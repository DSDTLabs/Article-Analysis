KOCHI: Cochin University of Science and Technology ( ) is in the process of identifying 20 research groups that will work together for five years to solve research problems. The group will be inter-disciplinary in nature.

 “This will ensure a bonding between team members and the senior person heading the group will promote the research culture,” said Cusat vice-chancellor J  . This is as part of the university’s initiative to set up an Rs 140crore international laboratory project in the campus with support from the   Fund Board. Sources said that though the university has encouraged each department to submit a list of the equipment that they require, the VC has decided to call for a meeting to discuss the various research projects.
 
 Already each department has appointed a nodal officer as part of the laboratory project.
 
 The officers should verify the list of equipment and the inter-disciplinary research groups and submit their reports on the proposed project and the equipment they require before the deadline.
 
 “Research is a continuous process and therefore we will encourage purchase of only those equipment that can be used by inter-disciplinary groups for research,” Letha added.
