NEW DELHI: Latching on to Yashwant Sinha’s criticism on the slump in economy,   slammed the Centre on Wednesday, saying it will be a miracle if the “clueless” Centre manages to turn it around before 2019. Congress neta   taunted the government, tweeting: “Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your copilot and FM speaking. Please fasten your seat belts and take brace position. The wings have fallen off our plane”.

 “As I travel around the country, what I hear is ‘achche din to aaye nahi, ye bure din kab jaayenge ’,” said former finance minister   at a press conference.
 
 He said, “Congress has assiduously exposed the many weaknesses in the economy and the terrible mismanagement. We are happy that   has echoed our criticism”.
 
 “The Congress will continue to speak loudly and boldly on the disastrous path on which the country is being taken by the BJP.” He appealed to all to speak and write “without fear”. “Darr ko chhod do (forget fear),” he said, referring to the fear that Sinha’s article claimed has gripped even top   netas who are afraid to criticise the government over economy.
 
 “The government is completely clueless about what is causing the economic decline... how long will it hide behind the rhetoric of the PM?” he asked. He said formation of a PM’s economic advisory council is like “putting band aid on several broken limbs”.
 
 “Sinha speaks truth to power. Will power now admit the truth that economy is sinking?” he tweeted. Quoting Sinha, he said the truth is that the growth rate of 5.7% is actually 3.7% or less.
