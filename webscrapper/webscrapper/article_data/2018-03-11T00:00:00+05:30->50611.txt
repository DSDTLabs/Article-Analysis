In what looks like an early   and bachelorette party in the run-up to their   this year, Sandalwood’s recently-engaged couple   and   went on fun trips with their respective buddies to Kophangnan and Singapore, albeit separately. While Chiru’s gang of seven boys including Pannaga Bharana and Prajwal Devraj, indulged in all things macho, including partying till the wee hours and enjoying laser tag, Meghana’s band of five girls including Prajwal’s wife Ragini, lived it up in Singapore. “For a week, we girls had the best time of our lives. We went shopping, stuffed our faces with food, partied till we dropped and slept like there’s no tomorrow,” says Meghana. The actor adds that she even bought one of the most expensive dresses in her wardrobe in Dingapte. “We searched for three hours for that outfit and finally when I wore it, we went to a fast food joint for dinner. My friends were irritated with me for doing that! Of course, we went clubbing after that, but this will give people an idea of what an utterly crazy trip this was. It was unforgettable,” sums up Meghana. Chiru and his boys won’t differ on that statement either!
