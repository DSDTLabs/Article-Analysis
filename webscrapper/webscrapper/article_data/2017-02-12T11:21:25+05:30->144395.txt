Delhi high court on February 8, ordered status quo in respect of some of the assets of late Abhey   which include properties at Delhi namely residential house situated at 3, Tilak Marg and a property at New Friends colony. The court has also ordered status quo on the bank accounts in Abhey's personal names and shares held by him.

  the estranged son of business tycoon late Abhey Oswal had earlier filed a petition in Delhi high court on February 4, against his mother  , younger brother Shaelender Oswal (bollywood singer Shael) and sister   (wife of  ), staking a claim for one fourth share in the property of his father, claiming to be a class-1 legal heir. Through his petition which was filed by senior advocates P. Chidambram, Rajiv Nayar and Rajeev Mehra, Pankaj claimed that there was an apprehension that the other legal heirs were in the process of disposing off the properties and also that since Abhey Oswal died on March 29, 2016 without leaving a will, he was entitled to his share in the assets owned and controlled by his late father as per Hindu succession act. Pankaj had also claimed that him being made to wear the traditional pagdi (turban) of the family in the Pagdi rasm held on April 3, 2016 after the death of his father was a sign that the Oswal family recognized him as the main heir to head the business empire. 
 
 Petition says that after the Pagdi rasm was over, a board meeting of OAML and OGL was secretly convened in Pankaj's absence. The petition said a resolution was passed in the said meeting of Board of Directors of OAML and OGL appointing his mother Aruna Oswal as the additional director and chairperson of both the companies.
