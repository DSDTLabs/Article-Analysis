 “Last year too we had removed silt from the dam. At present, the water level in the dam has dropped due to usage over the past eight months.

As a result, we are making a temporary road to reach the areas from where silt has to be removed,” said Manohar Khade, a state irrigation official.
 
 The irrigation department has also appealed to farmers to take away the silt and use it to enrich the soil in their farms. 
 
 Silt has been accumulating in the dam for around 50 years, and was not removed till last year. This led to a decrease in the water storage capacity of the dam, which normally would store around 9.67 TMC. Desilting was carried out in the dam for the first time last year. A total of 39,200 cubic metres of silt was removed from the dam due to which the storage capacity increased by 3.92 lakh litre.
 
 The Pavana dam, located around 40km from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits, is the lifeline of Pimpri Chinchwad. The dam was built around 1970 on Pavana river to provide irrigation water to the villages downstream of the river. It supplies water to around the 20 lakh population of the city. Water released from the dam is also used by Talegaon and Dehu Road towns as well as other downstream villages. At the moment, there is 2.66 TMC of water in the dam.
