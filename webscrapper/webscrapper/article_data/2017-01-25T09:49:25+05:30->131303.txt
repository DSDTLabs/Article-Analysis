LUCKNOW: Is mafia-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari planning to join BSP? Speculations were rife in   late on Tuesday evening barely three days after former SP minister Ambika Chaudhary joined the Mayawati camp. While no senior BSP leader wished to comment, sources said that Ansari did approach the party leadership after SP didn’t give tickets to him and his brother despite their outfit’s merger with the ruling party.

  Ansari, a sitting MLA of   from  , has been a bone of contention in the SP camp after QED merged with SP last year. UP CM   had shown his displeasure over the merger given Ansari’s criminal antecedents and it was formalised due to his uncle’s Shivpal’s initiative.
 
 However, after Akhilesh won the intra-family battle to take over as the national president and forged a tie-up with the Congress, QED’s two sitting MLAs were denied tickets. While Altaf Ansari was given SP’s ticket from Mau, the constituency of Mukhtar, Baijnath Paswan is SP’s nominee in his brother Sibgatullah Ansari’s seat Mohammadabad Gohna.
 
 Ansari won his first assembly election as a BSP candidate in 1996, and the next two as an independent. In 2007, he rejoined BSP and unsuccessfully contested the 2009   election in Varanasi against BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi. After BSP expelled him in 2010 for criminal activities, he formed his own QED with his brother Afzal. He won from Mau in 2012.
