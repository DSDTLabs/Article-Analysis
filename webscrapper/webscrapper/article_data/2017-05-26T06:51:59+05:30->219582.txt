KOCHI: More disquieting details continued to emerge as police began investigating the day-care centre whose owner was arrested for beating up a toddler on Tuesday. The maids working at the day-care centre, which is at the centre of controversy, told investigators that the centre's owner,   used to habitually beat the kids. The woman used to get annoyed and hit the kids when they urinated in the room or soiled their nappies, they told the police. “Two maids gave their statements on Thursday. They have seen Mathew beating and pinching the toddlers. If any of the kids urinated in their pants or the room, she used to get mad,“ said a police officer at   station.

 A magistrate court in   has rejected Mathew's bail application. She has been lodged in the women's cell of the district jail in Kakkanad.
 
 Mathew was arrested after a video clip of her beating a toddler surfaced on the social media. Police said the centre used to collect Rs 3,300 per month from the parents for looking after their kids.
 
 There were 17 toddlers at the centre. Mathew started the daycare centre,   in Palarivattom, one-and-a-half years ago after completing a teacher's training course.
