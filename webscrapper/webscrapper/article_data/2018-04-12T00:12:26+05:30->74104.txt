Panaji: Quepem recorded 2 mm of rainfall and Sanguem 1.5 mm during the past 24 hours ending 8.30am on Wednesday morning, as meteorologists said that a localized phenomenon triggered the isolated showers. Major parts of the country are experiencing rainfall due to various phenomenon, but in Goa, the rise in temperature coupled with moisture incursion brought some light rainfall in a few places and relief from the heat. “The rainfall occurred due to heating at the local level,” M L Sahu, director, India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji said. All other 11 centres, barring Quepem and Sanguem, did not record any rainfall, but other places beyond rain gauge centres such as Balli and Colvale recorded some quantum of rainfall. Extreme heating at the local level is likely to yield some rain if there is substantial moisture incursion. But if the moisture is not strong enough, it will dissipate, Sahu said. A low pressure area over Comorin in south India extending towards Maharashtra had yielded light rainfall during the last few days.  Goa had experienced light to moderate showers in many areas last month. Panaji had recorded the highest rainfall of 26.8mm and Canacona 24.6mm due to a depression in southeast Arabian Sea in mid-March.  IMD Panaji has forecast dry weather for the next four days, but localized heating can yield light rainfall. “We will inform the public through nowcasting in case of such developments,” Sahu said. The weather is likely to be dry during the next four days. The minimum and maximum temperatures have been largely within the normal range.
