HYDERABAD: The remarks made by senior   (TDP) leader Mothkupally Narsimhulu suggesting the party chief Chandrababu Naidu to merge   TDP with   (TRS) created ripples in political circles across the two Telugu states on Thursday. He said the party has lost its sheen post bifurcation and survival of the party in Telangana has become a major concern for the leaders like him. 

 The former TDP MLA made these remarks while addressing the media after paying floral tributes to NT   on his death anniversary at NTR Ghat. He said it is painful for him to listen to comments that the party lost its glory in state and there is no future for the party. 
 
 "Though I wanted to strengthen the party, there is nobody to support me. In the current situation, it would better to honour the feelings of party workers on merger," Narsimhulu said.
 
 "TRS chief KCR himself was a TDP leader and some ministers in the state cabinet were in TDP till a couple of years ago. Many leaders quit the party and joined TRS. My feeling is instead of facing embarrassing situation in the state, it would be better to merge the party with TRS," he said. The TDP leader said if Chandrababu Naidu is against such merger, he has to tour Telangana to strengthen the party.
 
 However, according to sources in TDP, Narsimhulu made these remarks as he had been trying to join TRS and even held discussions with some TRS leaders. He was reportedly seeking   membership from the state after joining TRS.
 
 Meanwhile, Telangana TDP president L   told TOI that Narsimhulu only expressed his personal view on it and dismissed any such move by the party. "The party will continue to fight in Telangana against the policies of ruling TRS government. In the coming 70 days, the party leaders will tour in the state," Ramana said.
