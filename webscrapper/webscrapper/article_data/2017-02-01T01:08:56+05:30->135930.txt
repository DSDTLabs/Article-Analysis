MUMBAI: From the next academic year, students appearing for the   will have to study the complete syllabus and score 33% in both   and   to pass. The CBSE, on Tuesday, issued the remodeled assessment structure for the board exams.

 In December last year, the CBSE announced its decision to make board exams mandatory, taking away the option of school-based exams. “Consequent upon the decision...the dual scheme of examination for class X shall stand discontinued for students from the academic year 2017-18,” said a circular issued by the board.
 
 According to the new structure, the board exams will carry 80 marks and internal assessment 20 marks. In the current format, the weightage is 60:40. Students will be tested for the complete syllabus in the theory papers. “Even college students appear for exams in the semester format, so why not give the choice to schools? Students were used to studying for half the syllabus and this will be additional burden now,” said a principal. Students are now required to score 23% marks in the board exams.
 
 For internal assessment, schools will have to conduct   in each subject, instead of the four formative assessments, and the average of the best two tests would be taken for final marks submission. 
 
 In addition to the tests, five marks each will be designated to notebook submission and subject enrichment activities that could include tests like reading and listening, lab activities and practical work, and projects. “Students are used to the no-detention and tend to take exams lightly. The new format could change that and students will prepare better for the board exams ,” said Kalpana Dwivedi, principal,  ,  .
 
 The board has included discipline as a grade subject and students will also be marked on attendance, sincerity, behaviour and values along with other co-scholastic subjects like work education, art and health and physical education. The structured will have to be replicated for classes VI to IX.
