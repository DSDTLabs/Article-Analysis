MOHALI: Prevention of crime against women and children should begin at home and at schools, said   Governor Dr Kiran Bedi here on Saturday.

 Speaking on the second day of   Leadership Summit here, the former IPS officer went on to give an example of rape-convict and   chief   when it came to crime against women. “He used to tease girls since schooldays. That is the time you should correct boys,” she said, when talking about the importance of conditioning a child. “Parents, home and schools play a bigger role. There is something called prevention, treatment and detection. If prevention fails, treatment should not fail. So, the first step is prevention. It’s important to identity a violator in school or at home. When homes and schools are failing, how many of these violators will police get hold of and how many will the judge punish? The key is to prevent 95% and let the system deal with the remaining 5%,” said Bedi.
 
 Bedi shared a five-point formula to inculcate good leadership qualities. “One should challenge the status quo, ride the waves, and be agile and action-oriented to become a good leader,” she said.
 
 Bedi said Indian society needed to be less complacent. The first woman IPS officer also talked of how corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives can make a difference in society. “There is a need to do analysis on   programmes. There are few companies which are performing CRS activities as formalities, but there are also some that are doing real service through CSR activities,” said Bedi.
 
 She narrated the students the story how she received the Ramon Magsaysay award and transformed a jail in Delhi into an ashram. She also talked about her book ‘It’s always possible’. When an ISB student asked her that the Bhagavad Gita, Quran and other holy books should be taught at schools, Dr Bedi said that she would have done so if she managed a school.
