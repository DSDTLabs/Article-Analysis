SHIMLA: On the completion of three years by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre, Congress leader   alleged that lynch mobs and   has become the rule under the   (BJP) government.

  He said the lynching of seven persons under the eye of the police and administration in BJP-ruled Jharkhand had shattered any sense of rule of law or rule by law. He said under the BJP watch, state justice was the way to the settlement of disputes.
 
 Addressing mediapersons in Shimla, Tiwari said the voice and freedom of the young stood abrogated. He said BJP and its organizations had the sole monopoly over every citizen’s right to wear clothes, eat food, speak, or even move around. He said centres of excellence and education were riddled with campus violence, and protesting students were persecuted, hounded, and often denied even the principal right to education.
 
 Further, he said the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data revealed that atrocities against Dalits and Scheduled Tribes had increased by 38% under the BJP government from the year 2013 to 2015. He said BJP had merely survived on UPA (United Progressive Alliance) schemes, and the ‘Make in India’ lion had failed to roar. 
 
 He said the BJP and Prime Minister Modi came to power, promising two crore new jobs every year. “By simple calculation, the BJP government should have created six crore new jobs in these three years. However, the labour ministry figures, reflect that only 1.35 lakh jobs were created in 2015 — that is the lowest in seven years. Unemployment is at a five-year high, and under-employment is at a staggering 35% of the workforce. By 2028, India needs to create 34 to 35 crore jobs, that is three to four crore jobs a year. How will that happen?”, he questioned.
 
 He said borders had been completely unsafe in the three years of the BJP government, and there were a series of flip-flops on foreign policy too.
