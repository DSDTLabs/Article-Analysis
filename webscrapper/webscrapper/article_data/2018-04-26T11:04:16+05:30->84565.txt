PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday asked the directorate of women and child development to submit details of children in homes registered under the Juvenile Justice Act to find out which children need to be repatriated to their families on an immediate basis.

 Advocate   told the court that there are more than 2,500 children in 67 homes in Goa, and that they hadn’t been produced before child welfare committees. Many of the children belong to other states, and, according to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, institutional care should be the last resort and children should be brought up with their own family, Pinho told the court.
 
 The court said it would require data on children in these homes as well as details of how many were from other states to ascertain how many need to be repatriated. Pinho stated that according to the Juvenile Justice Act, children should be restored to their families at the earliest. 
 
 Pinho also told the high court that there is one probation officer for North and South Goa, who is overburdened. He added that the government has been unable to fill up the second post that is lying vacant.
