PATNA: If not a one-off, Mahendra Singh’s is certainly a rare case. The proprietor of  , a confectionery shop near Boring Road roundabout, died on April 4, leaving behind a will which entitles his shop workers to 30% of the profits besides their salaries.

 Family members say the nonagenarian had premonition of his death. “A day before he was to be hospitalised for a surgery on April 1, he announced his will,” daughter Kamaljeet Kaur (61) said, adding he died during treatment at the hospital on April 4. 
 
 According to the will, 30% of the shop’s net profits have to be distributed among staff. While 20% has to be spent on business development, 10% on the maintenance of shop and workshop and 10% on welfare purposes, family members will get only 30% of the profits.
 
 According to shop accountant Raghunandan Prasad Sinha, the wages given to employees averages Rs 12,500 to Rs 15,000, and the net profit per month is around Rs 1 lakh. “There are around 50 workers,” he said.
 
 Kamaljeet, fourth of seven siblings, told TOI on Saturday her father cared for his staff. Shop worker Raghendra Rai nodded.
 
 “He would repeatedly tell us to eat less and spend on children’s education. Because of him, both my daughters Renu Kumari and Mamata are graduates from Patna Women’s College. Mamata did BEd, and is a teacher in a government school. My son is also a graduate from Patna College and is running a small restaurant,” septuagenarian Rai said.
 
 The Singhs migrated from Gujranwala to Patna after the partition in 1947. “Our family was given a space near Patna Junction where we started Prabhat Hotel... We later opened the Boring Road shop some 50 years ago,” said Kamaljeet. 
 
 Rajeev Jha, who as a 10-year-old started working at Quality Corner, recalled the shop would initially sell tea and toast. “I never thought of changing my job,” said Jha, now 52.
