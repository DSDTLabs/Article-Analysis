Surat: After renovation of Indoor Stadium at the cost of Rs 20 crore, now Surat   (SMC) plans to revamp the   built in 1980. Under the Rs 4 crore renovation plan, the Bhavan will undergo structural repairs, interior repairs, finishing work along with revamping of internal lightings. All the 800 chairs will be replaced along with the air conditioning system. 

 “We had no option but to keep this facility open as city didn’t have any other facility for cultural activities, especially for plays that come from Mumbai and Ahmedabad. So, we did repairs and keep the hall open. However, now people have option of Sanjeev Kumar auditorium in Pal and Sardar Smruti Bhavan in  , so we can afford to keep this hall closed for 10 month period and get major repairs done,” said  , zonal chief of Central zone, SMC.
 
 The civic body has initiated process for selection of consultant. Once a consultant is appointed, according to his suggestion, total restructuring of the hall will be undertaken from August or September this year. 
 
 During minor repairing in 2010, flooring of the facility was changed and new carpets were laid. Also, the stage lights were replaced with new ones and a wall painting was replaced. 
 
 Today, after 37 years of it being dedicated to the people, Gandhi Smruti Bhavan is in dilapidated condition.
 
 From the time it was dedicated to the people of the city, this facility has been a favourite for stage performers. In last 37 years, 10 plays have been performed on monthly basis, including large number of hit   commercial plays from Mumbai.
