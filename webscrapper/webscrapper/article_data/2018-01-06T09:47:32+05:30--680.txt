 After addressing the rally at Tikrikilla, Shah will fly in to Shillong to inaugurate the newly constructed BJP office in the city and also hold interactions with party workers here. Shah had postponed his visit to the state on at least two occasions last year as he was preoccupied with the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh elections, party sources said.
