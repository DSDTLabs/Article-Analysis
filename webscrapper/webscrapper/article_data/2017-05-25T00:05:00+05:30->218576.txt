If the ‘Theatre of the Absurd’ is something that tugs at your heart,
  is a play for you. Deeply inspired by the existentialism in celebrated Irish playwright-novelist Samuel Beckett’s dramatic pieces, this new Hindi play is set at a railway station and weaves with it a slew of intriguing characters — that ranges from a man and a woman to a family of pigeons, a crow, two circus clowns and a tea stall.

  An adaptation of actor-theatre director Manav Kaul’s play by the same name, this piece of drama is crafted by city-based performing arts collective,  , and comprises a total of 15 characters, enacted by a group of professional and amateur actors.
 
  “
  is essentially a love story that unfolds at a railway station. A sense of unpredictability and incompleteness runs through the entire play, as the different personalities tangle up and so do their emotions, thoughts and actions. The play has seven original scores that include thematic songs as well as poetic renditions. For instance, there are songs from a pigeon’s perspective, while the elements of fear and waiting are also translated into music as part of its narrative technique,” says  , director of the play, which will premiere over the next weekend at a venue in the city.
