 The man, identified as Ram, was a resident of Jamalpur village who was a mason by profession and was working on repairing a roundabout in Tulsi Niketan.
 
 The farmhouse shares its boundary wall with ID Memorial School, a private institute belonging to Omvir Singh, who is also the principal of the school. The farmhouse, constructed a few years ago, is also Singh’s property. The building has six rooms, out of which one was occupied by Ram who used to live there alone, and another room houses a family of construction labourers.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Omvir Singh said, “I had rented this farmhouse to one Babloo some months ago. I knew the guy who died because I used to see him leaving his room sometimes. I do not know if it is a murder, that is for the police to decide.”
 
 Seconding Omvir’s views, Babloo said, “I was present there last night and I saw him drinking with three other youths. I am quite sure that excessive consumption of alcohol is what claimed his life. He used to drink every day. I used to watch him doing it. I had never seen those youths before and they would have left after drinking with him late at night.”
 
 Ram was said to have been an alcoholic, and excessive alcohol intake on Sunday night is being considered the reason behind his death. “He was a compulsive drinker. He was found dead on his bed, covered with a quilt and we believe he died in his sleep,” said Dhirendra Singh Yadav, SHO, Sahibabad police station.
 
 The police said there were no external injury marks, suggestive of assault, on his body. However, they are not ruling out any other cause of death.
 
 Meanwhile, the body has been sent for autopsy and the report is awaited.
 
 An FIR in the mater will be registered on the basis of the postmortem report.
