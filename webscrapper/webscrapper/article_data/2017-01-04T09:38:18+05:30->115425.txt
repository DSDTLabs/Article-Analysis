MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday directed the state's chief secretary and the health secretary to file a report on action taken to eradicate mosquitoes in the state and adjourned the case to January 9. 

 Madurai-based KK Ramesh had filed the   stating that the government failed to obey the court order directing it to take action to check mosquito menace. The petition came up for hearing before the division bench headed by justice A Selvam. 
 
 The petitioner said that he had filed a petition before the   bench seeking direction to the government to eradicate mosquitoes and accordingly, the court had delivered an order in 2014. "But, no action was taken. The government has failed to clean drainage channels and sewers. Hundreds of people, including children, died of diseases like dengue and chikungunya in Ramanathapuram, Paramakudi, Madurai' Peraiyur and Vaniyambadi. There are no separate wards in government hospitals to treat such patients. Hence, to ensure their safety, every family should be provided with mosquito nets and separate wards should be set up in government hospitals," the petitioner said. 
 
 However, the government consul insisted that it had taken steps to eradicate mosquitoes. 
 
 Following it, the bench told the government consul that as mosquito menace is severe even in the HC bench campus, which is in the city limit, situation in villages could be very bad. "The court has already passed an order to that effect in 2014. What steps have you taken?" the court added.
