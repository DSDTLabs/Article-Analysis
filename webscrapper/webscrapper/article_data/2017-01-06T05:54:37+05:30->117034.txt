NEW DELHI: Dubbing the opposition demand for postponing the   in view of assembly elections as another “tantrum“ after the “failure“ of its campaign against demonetisation,   suggested on Thursday that no announcements specific to the five states going to polls will be made in the   to be presented on February 1.

 “The opposition's demand is another political gimmick as the Centre has already clarified that the allocations will not be specific about states where polls are to be held,“ said BJP spokesman Shrikant  .
 
 Calling the attempt to thwart Budget presentation as “anti-poor, anti-farmer“, he said the exercise for the welfare of people cannot be put on hold for state polls. “There was an interim Bud get even before the 2014   polls despite the fact that the poll schedule was known to all,“ Sharma said.
 
 The BJP member said presentation of the Budget is as per traditions and the   was informed even before the dates were an nounced. “Recent surveys have indicated that BJP is sweeping the polls in five states...The opposition's objections to the Budget presentation is only a bid to distract from the core issues, which is corruption of parties like Congress and TMC,“ Sharma said.
 
 He took a dig at the opposition saying that on the one hand, they have termed demonetisation a “big scam“ and a “failure“ and on the other, they are against the session starting from January 31. “These parties have had a history of negative politics and by opposing presentation of the Budget, they have again shown that they are anti-poor and anti-farmer,“ Sharma said.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP's two-day national executive meeting will begin in New Delhi on Friday and the party is expected to showcase its resolve to weed out corruption, with demonetisation as the central theme.
