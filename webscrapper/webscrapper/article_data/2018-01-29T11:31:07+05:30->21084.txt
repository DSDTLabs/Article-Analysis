NEW DELHI:   Infocomm has disrupted the telecom market once again. The Rs 49 low-cost data plan of Jio is likely to force other leading telecom operators such as Bharti  ,   India, and   Cellular - to shift to more cost-efficient VoLTE-based 4G networks to rescue their rapidly falling average revenue per user (ARPU).

 Under Rs 49 plan, the Jio is offering a free voice for life and a GB of data at 4G speeds over a 28-day validity period. This Jio plan is likely to draw many low-end 2G voice customers across India away from Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea and move towards VoLTE 4G services. 
 
 This will increase the financial woes of already struggling telecom service providers. 
 
 As per US-based Brokerage firm JP Morgan, the 2G feature phone user segment constitutes a whopping 70 per cent of country's billion-plus mobile user base garnering as much as 50 per cent of sector revenues.
 
 According to telecom regulator data, the ARPU of prepaid users is Rs 70, of which the voice ARPU of feature phone users is in the Rs 50-60 range.
 
 Apart from Jio, most of the telecom companies have shown poor numbers in last quarter results. Jio's move to target millions of 2G feature phone users of other service providers would further damage the latter's already weak financials, forcing them to shut their 2G, 3G services and launch VoLTE-based 4G networks.
