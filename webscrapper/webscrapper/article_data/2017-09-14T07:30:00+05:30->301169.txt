Chandigarh: Teachers who report to work late and sneak out early are warned. The 11 government and aided colleges of the city have introduced the   system to know who comes in and leaves, and when. 

 Biometric devices use fingerprints, facial images, iris/retina prints and voice recognition for security identification, authentication, and marking presence. There is not much monitoring of teachers coming in and leaving from the colleges. 
 
 UT higher education state liaison officer Bikram Rana said, “The Chandigarh higher education department has installed the biometric machines in all colleges. Biometric attendance is mandatory under RUSA (Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan). Later, the system will be linked with the Aadhaar number.”
 
 Sources said that the decision to monitor the working hours of college teachers was taken to fulfil the conditions that University Grants Commission (UGC) has laid down. 
 
 It conditions stated by UGC require each member of the faculty to log in at least six teaching hours a day. The colleges have a manual system of employee attendance, and it does not mention the hours.
 
 The higher education department has been working on the proposal for a mobile-phone application for the faculty and staff attendance, besides the counting of lectures and payment. 
 
 The department will install an internal messaging module for communicating with the employees through e-mail and SMS (short messaging service). 
 
 The step aims at achieving the reform admission target of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).
