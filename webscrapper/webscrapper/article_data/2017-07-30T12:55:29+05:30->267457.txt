CHANDRAPUR: The trouble tigress of Armori range in Gadchiroli attacked yet another person in the forest near Ravi village on Saturday. Earlier, the tigress had killed two persons from different villages in the same forest.

 Accoridng to reports, the   Shivdas Choukhe, who is a resident of Ravi village, was out in the forest collecting firewood when the lurking tigress attacked him. 
 
 He, however, was rescued by the forest guards patrolling nearby. He was rushed to Armori rural hospital for emergency treatment.
 
 Forest officials have confirmed the incident and said that Choukhe is out of danger and is undergoing treatment. 
 
 People in Ravi (Arsoda) and surrounding village under Armori range are terrified following repeated   attacks. The feline had killed one Lavhaji Meshram from Kondhala on April 5 and Waman Marappa from Ravi on May 13 in same area.
 
 Sources in the forest department said a migratory tiger and tigress are moving in Brahmapuri forest after crossing Vainganga river. They have settled in the area since the last few months due to good prey base and availability of water.
 
 Being young, the tigress might have been attacking people by venturing deep into the jungle, officials suspect. 
 
 The forest department has already taken up preventive measures and have installed camera traps to identify the problem feline. They have also warned people against venturing alone in the forest.
