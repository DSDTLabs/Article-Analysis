NASHIK: Senior Nationalist   leader   met  , the farmer from Yeola who had set a fire his ready-to-harvest crop at his   farm on Wednesday. 

 Dongre set his ready-to-harvest crop spread over his three acres on fire on Monday as onion prices crashed. He was apprehensive that his crop would not fetch him good rates. The farmer had a total of five acres under onion plantation, of which, two acres were damaged due to karpa disease. He could not take preventive measures due to lack of cash after demonetisation. 
 
 Now, he had three acres of ready-to harvest onion but set it on fire as he was to recover even the labour cost. “Wholesale onion prices are in the range of Rs 150 to Rs 200 per quintal, while the cost of growing onions was Rs 60,000 per acre. It was also difficult to manage labour cost from the harvest. What is the use of harvest if I cannot recover transport costs? I had no option but to set my farm on fire,” Dongre told TOI.
 
 Sule collected around 10 kg burnt onions in a gunny bag and said she would show it to chief minister   and the authorities in New Delhi. “Sule visited my farm. She collected around 10kg burnt onions and said she will pursue the issue with the Union government,” Dongre said.
