PUNE: The Pune regional transport office ( ) has made it mandatory for   in the city to undergo a   during the summer vacation.

 Regional transport officer   told TOI that the inspection will focus on whether vehicles are good enough to ferry students to schools and if they’re following all norms.
 
 “There is no record of the number of unregistered and illegal vehicles ferrying school students. As an estimate, for every 1,500 vehicles, less than five per cent would be illegal. The RTO has compiled a list of vans and buses that are registered to ferry schoolchildren,” Ajri said.
 
 At present, there are a total of 3,695 vehicles, including buses and vans that ferry students, registered with the RTO. 
 
 “The RTO needs to check these vehicles to ensure the safety of children. There might be arguments from school transport organisations that holding tests during vacations is difficult since the drivers go to their native places. The manner in which the inspection will be conducted and other details will be decided soon,” the official pointed out.
 
 Sources in the RTO said that missing the fitness test could result in stringent action, including cancellation of vehicle registration, fine, or both. Apart from checking the vehicles, the authority will also check if the vehicles follow stipulated guidelines. Drivers and conductors of the buses will also be checked.
 
 The RTO is planning to start a demonstration-cum-training programme aimed at ensuring safety of schoolchildren in case the vehicle meets with an accident, catches fire, or in any emergency situation. “The programme will be planned out soon. The RTO is concerned about the safety of school-going children,” Ajri stated.
