Distance does make the heart grow fonder. TV actor   had to break up with his girlfriend   to finally realise that she is the one. And now, the two are all set to get engaged on August 16. 

 Kunal and Puja fell in love nine years ago, during the course of their show, ' '. Kunal says, “This is an impromptu decision. We were initially planning to have the roka in November. However, when Puja handed me over a list of around 250 guests, I decided to turn it into an engagement ceremony. My sister also insisted that we don’t delay it any further.”
 
 Opening up about his recent break-up, Kunal says, “There comes a time when you need to settle down with your soulmate. After that brief split, I fell in love with Puja all over again. Nobody can love me the way she does. I’ve had my share of relationships, but I have never cared about any girl so much. Puja has made me a better person. We fight a lot, but she has never left my side. I called it quits because I wanted my space. However, it made me realise that break-up is not a solution. I was extremely immature.” The couple plans to tie the knot next year.
