MUMBAI: Noted Marathi   Arun Date whose iconic songs Shukratara, Hya janmavar hya jaganyavar, Bhatukalicha khelamadhale, Asen mi nasen mi and Yeshil yeshil remain popular 60 years after they were recorded, passed away at his home in   on Sunday.

 Date was a tall, bespectacled gentleman who wore the hint of a smile on his round face. He had turned 84 on May 4, and though he had been ailing for some years, fans were shocked to learn of his demise just two days after his birthday.
 
 He entered the field of music slightly late, after having taken a degree in textile engineering and working with the Birla group. He learnt music from Kumar Gandharva and K Mahavir, and began singing with   in 1955. But 'Shukratara', a duet with   that released in 1962, became his signature song. It grew into a successful concert series spanning 2,500 shows. Malhotra told TOI, “He sang so skilfully. He was a new entrant and I had been singing playback for years by then. Shukratara became so popular that we did many live shows. Date had a soft tone, somewhat like Talat Mahmood.” Yet, he seemed to ascend the heavens when he hit the high notes in his full-throated style like Mahendra Kapoor.
 
 Radio and TV channels celebrated his life all of Sunday by playing Dilya ghetlya vachananchi, Dole kashasathi and his duet with Lata Mangeshkar, Sandhikali hya asha. Mangeshkar tweeted, “I am deeply pained by his death. I became acquainted with him later, but before that, I was acquainted with his father at the home of Kumar Gandharva.”
