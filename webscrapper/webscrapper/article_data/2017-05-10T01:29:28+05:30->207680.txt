JODHPUR: Union home minister   believes   has not been given his due place in history. On Tuesday, Singh urged historians to re-evaluate the contribution of the Rajput warrior king, reiterating a concern he has raised earlier as well.

 Addressing a gathering in Pali district during the unveiling of a statue of the ruler of Mewar, Singh said, “It was Maharana Pratap who fought with great valour for freedom and self-respect, sacrificing everything, and never gave into Akbar, but I am surprised — how come our historians rated   as great and not Pratap?” “What shortcoming did they notice in Pratap that he was not referred to as ‘the great’,” Singh said. He added it was time this “blunder” was corrected and Pratap accorded the respect he deserved.
 
 Singh said it was inspiration drawn from Pratap that triggered the urge for freedom in many and India achieved Independence in 1947.
