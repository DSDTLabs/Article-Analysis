PANAJI: Farmers in parts of Goa have lost a significant chunk of their crop, especially mango, owing to unseasonal rain and the thunderstorm that prevailed in the wee hours of Thursday. 

 The chilli crop at Dharbandora has reportedly been flattened by strong winds. Unharvested paddy in some blocks of Sanguem, an area that was cultivated late, is also likely be affected because harvest there continues till the third week of May, agriculture officials said.
 
 “We are in the process of verification of loss. There have been no concrete reports so far. Scattered reports of uprooted fruit trees and substantial banana crop damage in some pockets have come to us,” agriculture director Nelson Figueiredo, said.
 
 “Around 100 of my cashew trees have been uprooted. I’ve lost mangoes worth around Rs 10,000, bananas worth Rs 7,000 and coconuts worth Rs 25,000,” Sanjeev Barve, a farmer from Nagargao, Sattari, said.
 
 Even as he tries to salvage whatever has survived the storm, he has little hope for the future. “In the past, too, we have faced losses due to natural calamities, but the collectorate has only made a report of crop damage and left it at that. We have received no monetary incentives from the government so far,” he said.
 
 Under the Shetkari Aadhar Nidhi scheme, farmers can inform the department through the zonal agriculture officer (ZAO) concerned within seven days of   and their claims will be compensated up to a certain amount. “This will be done as per the norms of the scheme, which is Rs 25,000 per hectare for field crops in case of total loss.” Figueiredo said.
