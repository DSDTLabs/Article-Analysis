CHANDIGARH: The   excise and taxation department has served notices to liquor vends operating on agricultural land. 

 There are several liquor vends being run on agricultural land in Sarangpur, Kishangarh, Khuda Alisher, Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd. The department has directed the owners of these vends to shift their shops, failing which, action will be initiated against them.
 
  and Haryana high court in January had passed an order declaring vends operating on agricultural land illegal and had directed the Chandigarh administration to ensure that no vends are setup on agricultural land and take stringent action against the ones already being run in such surroundings.
 
 The department will soon hold an auction of the remaining liquor vends.
 
 After four auctions, the department has failed to sell four liquor vends. The last auction was held on April 25. The department did not receive any bids for liquor vends in Sector 17, 9, Mauli Jagran and Village Maloya. Despite the department's failure in selling the vends, their reserve prices have not been reduced.
 
 The liquor traders in the city are demanding that the department should bring down the reserve price else there will be no takers for the remaining vends.
 
 Till now, of the 93 units, the department has allotted as many as 89 vends. The auctions have raked in Rs 309.37 crore in bid amount/license fee, against the total reserve price of Rs 240.09 crore - a 27% rise on the reserved price.
 
 In the previous two auctions, the liquor vend at Dhanas village emerged as the most expensive buy as it fetched a price of Rs7.27 crore. In the auction held on April 4, the vend was purchased by Panjak Sangari against the reserve price of Rs5 crore.
