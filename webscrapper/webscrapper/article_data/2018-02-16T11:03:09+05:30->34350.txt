CHENNAI: Residents in   are annoyed over a move to open a   shop-cum-bar by the foot over bridge opposite the railway station.

 The shop is earmarked to be set up on a narrow piece of land next to the FOB that connects the bus stop with the railway station and is frequented by hordes of commuters.
 
 “The proposal was kept under wraps from the public and we were never consulted. The tahsildar has authority to give approval for opening the shop. Several students use the path and it will not be right to have a   in such a place,” said civic activist David Manoharan.
 
 “It is proposed that the bar will be functional on the first floor while the shop will be running out of the ground floor. Scores of commuters, including girl students from neighboring colleges, use the FOB and the path next to the complex daily. Having a wine shop in such a location will only aggrieve the public and cause an inconvenience to the public transport users that frequent this part,” said a resident of Chromepet, V Santhanam.
 
 Santhanam added that resident associations are coming together to distribute pamphlets to the public, informing them of the perils of allowing a Tasmac shop open in such a space. “We want to address the issue before it is started else it will be too late,” said Santhanam.
 
 When TOI contacted the tahsildar of  , he denied knowing anything about the Tasmac shop. “We have not given permission for a Tasmac   to come up or heard anything about any wine shop coming up near the bus stand in Chromepet,” he said.
