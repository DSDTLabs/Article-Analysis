VASCO: Following the ammonia tanker incident in  , the   (MMC) has decided not to allow transportation of toxic gas in Vasco as it is posing threat to lives.

 Civic body chief   said, “If the incident had to happen during the day time and that too in the city, the situation would have been worse. It is high time we take some steps to check this. We are sitting on a ticking bomb, which may explode if goes unchecked. The council will send a letter to the Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) seeking details of hazardous products being transported,’’ he said.
 
 An official of   (ZACL)   informed that at least six to seven tankers of ammonia are brought to the company via road every day.
 
 “Ammonia gas is imported and has to be transported through road network. Most companies follow this procedure as it is very difficult to supply it through a pipeline network,’’ he said, adding, the transportation takes place as per the requirement of the company.
