PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (MMRCL) will be checking the   of the Nashik Phata-Moshi and Moshi-Chakan routes, as these   can be developed to provide quick connectivity to the industrial areas in and around  .

 Shashikant Limaye, the senior technical adviser for MMRCL, spoke to TOI on sidelines of   at Rotary Club Pimpri on Tuesday. “The industrial area in and around Chakan is developing rapidly. Thousands of people from Pune and   work in this area. Metro can be a good public transport option for these people. But these are new routes, so we need to check if they are financially viable.”
 
 “Chakan lies in the Pune metropolitan region governed by the   (PMRDA). A PMRDA development plan (DP) is being prepared to make it easy to reserve land for a metro route to Chakan. As the area around Chakan is rapidly developing, reserving land now makes sense, as later, it might become difficult to acquire land,” said Limaye when asked about the reason for conducting a feasibility study. “We have appointed a consultant to prepare the detailed project report of Nashik Phata-Moshi and Moshi-Chakan routes. The actual work will start in one-two weeks. The report will be prepared in six months,” said Limaye. “Traffic survey of the routes, a comprehensive mobility plan and traffic forecast of the area will be prepared. An estimated cost of the project will also be readied,” he said.
