 The multi-modal logistics parks ( ) is expected to come up on an area of 106 acres facing the port connectivity road on the land owned by VPT. 
 
 The proposed MMLP is expected to handle container cargo of around 57,474 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalents) and break bulk of 1.25 million tonnes, once the project is completed.
 
 VPT chairman   said, “We have identified 106 acres for a multipurpose warehousing zone. VPT is planning to sign a memorandum of understanding with the National Highways for the project. The NHAI will be investing funds for the project, whereas VPT will be providing the land as equity. We are hoping that this project will be coming up soon.”
 
 VPT sources said the project is the first-of-its-kind being taken up by the NHAI following directions by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH). 
 
 “The idea came up during a meeting of MoRTH in which it was decided that NHAI will go into development of multi-modal logistics parks across the country. The VPT is the first to have sent a proposal to NHAI elaborating on the potential involved in development of a MMLP or multipurpose warehousing zone in Vizag,” another VPT official confirmed. 
 
 “The idea is to concentrate on clean cargo – especially cold storage for food processing or other types of baggage cargo,” the official said adding that the warehousing infrastructure would be developed by NHAI. “NHAI venturing into warehousing is a recent policy decision and we are positive that it will benefit both VPT as well as NHAI,” he added.
