GHAZIBAD: Two days after the alleged   of two minor girls by their own father came to light, the Ghaziabad district magistrate Ministhy S has announced a relief of Rs 1 lakh each to the girls under the state government’s Rani Lakshmi Bai Mahila Evam Bal Samman Kosh scheme on Monday.

 The DM specified that the amount would be provided to the girls after copies of their FIRs and medical reports are procured by the administration and reviewed.
 
 Ministhy also said Rs 2 lakh each would be transferred to the bank accounts of both the sisters after the police file a chargesheet in the matter. 
 
 “The process to transfer monetary relief for the two   has begun, and we are waiting for police action to begin so that we can go ahead with the procedure. We will make sure that all necessary help is provided to the girls as soon as possible,” she said.
 
 However, none of the doctors who performed medical examination of the girls have confirmed rape, citing ethical responsibility to their patients and confidential information. “I cannot disclose these details because this is a grievous matter,” said Dr Sangeeta Goel, Zila Mahila Chikitsalya, Ghaziabad.
