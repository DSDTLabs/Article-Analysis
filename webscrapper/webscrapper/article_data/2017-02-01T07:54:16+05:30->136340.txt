PALAKKAD: The Tamil Nadu government has once again failed to honour the inter-state Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) agreement by not filling the   reservoir to its full reservoir level (FRL) of 2,663 feet. 

 The water level in the reservoir on Tuesday was only 2,644.2 feet, 18.8 feet below the FRL.
 
 As per PAP agreement, Tamil Nadu has to fill Kerala Sholayar to its FRL of 2,663 on every February 1 and September 1.
 
 The FRL condition on February 1 and September 1 was of prime importance to Kerala, as it ensured a full reservoir with 5.42 tmcft of water for the lean months of February to May to provide water to Chalakudy river basin to ensure drinking water to   district, said  , joint director of joint water regulatory board of PAP.
 
 In February last year also the agreement was not honoured. But the water level then was better at 2,651.51 feet.In 2015 the reservoir was brought to the FRL only in February and in 2014, only in September.
 
 In 2013-14 and 2012-13 and on a number of times earlier also, Tamil Nadu had violated the pact, Padikkal said.
 
 The inter-state PAP agreement was signed between Kerala and Tamil Nadu on sharing of waters of the river basins of Bharathapuzha, Chalakudypuzha and Periyar. The pact was signed and executed on May 29, 1970, with retrospective effect from November 9, 1958.
 
 According to the data available with the Joint Water Regulatory Board (JWRB) of the PAP, Tamil Nadu had honoured the condition only nine times on September 1 and only once on February 1 between 1970 and 2004. This condition of FRL twice a year was incorporated into the PAP agreement to compensate for the inter-basin diversion of Parambikulam, Peruvaripallom, Thunakadavu and Sholayar tributaries to Tamil Nadu.
