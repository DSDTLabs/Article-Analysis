Thapki tears the letter and gives the recording chip to Shraddha. Shraddha destroys the chip but Thapki shows one more chip and threatens her that she can blackmail her anytime.
 
  Dhruv comes into the room and Thapki tells him to come with her and check the recording.
  
  Thapki is shocked as the recording has been changed. It has Thapki threatening Shraddha that she will not let her marry Bihaan. Thapki is shocked.
  
  Sankara recalls recording Thapki and Shraddha's conversation and changing the memory card.
  
  Dhruv is shocked and doesn't believe Thapki. Sankara comes in between and pretends to cry and gains sympathy.
  
  Later in the day, Sankara and Thapki are doing puja. Bihaan is about to apply tikka but his hand gets burnt and the sindoor falls on Thapki's forehead.
