AMRITSAR:   jathedar   has called a meeting of Sikh high priests on January 8 to table the report of an SGPC panel that was formed to look into the December 26 incident in which a Sikh prayer was “distorted“ at an event organized by Punjab minister  .

 The jathedar told The Times of India on Sunday that he had received the three-member panel's report. He said the Akal Takht would, during the meeting, also take up the matter of Neeldhari sect head   allegedly making objectionable remarks about the history of Sikh Gurus.
 
 The jathedar had formed the committee after a video of a priest changing the prayer had gone viral. The prayer was recited at the inauguration of the election office of SAD leader Maluka in Rampura Phul, Bathinda district. The decision comes a day after Sikh leaders appointed as jathedars during a self-styled   on November 10, 2015, had summoned Maluka and Satnam Singh on January 9.
