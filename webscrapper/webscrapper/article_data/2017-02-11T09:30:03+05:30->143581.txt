LUCKNOW: Union home minister   on Friday defended PM  's `raincoat' comment on   as a statement made in praise of the former Prime Minister.
Rajnath said the PM only meant to say that despite charges of corruption during the UPA rule, Singh faced no charges. “We respect former Prime Mininster Dr Manmohan Singh. In fact, we respect all the former Prime Ministers the country has seen.“
 
 The home minister also said that   was creating a fuss out of nothing and questioned why Singh's “organised crime“ remark on PM Modi's demonetization decision had not evoked any objections.
 
 “Who is involved in organised crime? A criminal.Does that mean the country's PM is a criminal?“ Rajnath said.
 
 He said the decision on demonetisation was not taken keeping polls in mind but keeping national interest in mind. “It is a visionary step to ensure safety and security of the future generations,“ Rajnath said.
 
 He added that every possible dossier on India's “most wanted fugitive“   had been handed over to Pakistan.Even international community support is being taken on the issue, Rajnath said and added that his government wants Dawood to be brought to the country and tried in an Indian court of law.
