Kapurthala: A surprise inspection of a hotel on the Jalandhar-Phagwara national highway by the health department team revealed it was not adhering to food safety parameters. 

 Assistant commissioner (food) Dr Harjot Pal Singh said the checking was carried out on the directions of higher authorities that Hotel Cabbana was compromising with hygienic conditions. Phagwara senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Devinder Singh and food safety officer Satnam Singh also accompanied the inspection team, which collected six samples of the food being prepared and sent them for laboratory tests.
 
 The assistant commissioner said the violations included open dustbins kept in the immediate vicinity of food items, bug-infested Bengal gram and rotten vegetables — cabbage and okra — among other things.
 
 He also said further legal action would be taken against the offenders based on the report of analysis of the state food laboratory, Kharar under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006 and Rules & Regulations 2011.
