 actor-singer   is in Bengaluru. He has just begun shooting for  , which stars   in the lead role. The actor, who has previously done Tamil films, is elated about his Kannada debut. “There are a few things that had me instantly say yes to this film. First, this is my first South Indian film outside Tamil, so I wanted to branch out. Second, the team of this film is amazing. Third, this is a role that is unlike any of the others I have essayed thus far. The character will linger on in one’s mind long after one has seen the film and I couldn’t say no to a character like that after the narration,” says Sudhanshu.
The actor further says that the role is unlike the usual villainous ones seen onscreen. “The character I play is not someone who is loud or crazy. Instead, he is smart and uses his brain over brawn, which makes him a very unlikely suspect. I am not at liberty to reveal anything more,” signs off Sudhanshu, who is awaiting the release of Shankar’s  , the Tamil film that has   in the lead.
