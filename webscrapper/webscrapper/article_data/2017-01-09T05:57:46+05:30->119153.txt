LUCKNOW: Many makeshift winter ‘raen baseras’ (night shelter) in the city have been set up precariously close to busy roads, making them prone to a Dalibagh-like accident. Set up mostly by NGOs, individuals and government departments, the shelters have come up without the permission of the   (LMC). 

 The one outside   is located next to a busy road leading to Kaiserbagh. Similarly, those at   and Hanuman Setu have been set up on the side of the main roads. 
 
  near Polytechnic crossing has been set up on the road under the flyover. The ones at Husadia crossing and Charbagh too were found on the roadside where an accident can happen any time. As the news of accident split in the city, people living in these shelters started fleeing out of fear. Some camps were lying vacant on Sunday night with shelterless people preferring to move to other places. 
 
 When asked, municipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh said all 23 shelter homes run by the LMC are permanent concrete structures constructed at safe places. “The makeshift raen baseras are set up by NGOs, individuals and other government departments without our approval,” he said. 
 
 When asked why LMC allowed them to be set up at dangerous locations, he said any action against them would create uproar and LMC would be dubbed anti-poor. 
 
 LMC, however, will now act. Additional municipal commissioner P K Srivastava said all zonal officer will be asked to take action against unauthorised night shelters in the wake of the accident.
