BENGALURU: Shortly after the Indian hockey team for the Commonwealth Games was announced on Tuesday at the SAI campus here, many players who didn’t make the cut had warm wishes for the ‘lucky’ ones. One player though, a seasoned pro at that, stayed conspicuously elusive.

 
 Sardar Singh, 31, perhaps harboured hopes of going out in a blaze of glory, or least on his terms, but the truth is the former skipper has been a liability - his speed and consistency have dropped considerably - for some time now. So much so that when the midfielder’s name did not figure in the list of 18, some critics would have said “about time”.
 
 Still, his absence would be missed if only for his wealth of experience. This is the first time since 2006 when Sardar made his senior team debut, the national team will travel to a major event without the once go to man of Indian hockey. This could well signal the end of his career.
 
 Also failing to make the cut were defenders Birendra Lakra, Surender Kumar, midfielder SK Uthappa and striker Ramandeep Singh. Barring Lakra, all the others were a part of the team which finished fifth at the Sultan Azlan Shah tournament last week. Sardar captained that team with Ramandeep serving as his deputy.
 
 Speaking about Sardar’s exclusion, chief coach Sjoerd Marijne said, “He's not in the 18 (for the  ), so he didn't convince us enough. It's not only in the Azlan Shah but also in the Asia Cup. It's not just the tournaments; we also saw every training session.”
