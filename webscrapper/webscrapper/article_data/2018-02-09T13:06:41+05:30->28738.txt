KANYAKUMARI: M  , 55, headmistress of the  , and Tamil teacher J  , 49, who brought the sexual abuse of the nine minor boys to the notice of the district collector, said they were left speechless on hearing the boy narrate the torture they were subjected to. 

 “This seventh standard student and eight other boys did not know what ‘paliyal vankodumai’ (sexual abuse) meant till they saw news on television channels and papers about their hostel. I came to know about the abuse when I asked the boy for his homework note as I had earlier bought it for him,” said Vijayakumari. “I have heard stray incidents happening to children elsewhere. This was the first time I came across such violence against my children,” she told TOI.
 
 The school has 54 boys and girls studying till class eight, including 13 boys from the hostel situated half-a-kilometre from the school. Devaprabha, a teacher for three decades, has been the headmistress of the school for more than nine years while Vijayakumari has been a teacher for 27 years and has been at the school for nine years. “Our only concern is that the abuser may harm the boys if he comes out,” said Devaprabha.
 
 The teachers went to the hostel the next day and warned the cook of dire consequences if he continued abusing the boys. But he assaulted the student. Agitated over the turn of events, Vijayakumari and Devaprabha took it to the notice of Assistant Education Officer (AEO) S  . “These boys are the future of the country. If they suffered such violence and suppression at an early age they would turn out to be goons and antisocial elements,” Devaprabha added.
