KARWAR:   MP Anant Kumar Hegde assaulted two doctors and a private hospital worker in   on Tuesday. He was angry that they didn't attend to his mother on priority .

 Sources said that the MP's mother   suffered a leg fracture after a fall in her house on Monday. She was rushed to TSS Hospital in Sirsi. Since the doctor on duty was busy in the operation theatre, Hegde had to wait for some time before getting medical attention.
 
 However, patience ran out for Kumar, who stormed into the hospital at dawn and asked the doctors to attend to his mother. The doctors allegedly gave an impolite reply. The MP then dragged Dr GV Madhukeshwar out of the ward and thrashed and kicked him. When Dr Balachandra Bhat and employee Rahul Musharkar tried to save Madhukeshwar, the MP assaulted them as well. They suffered injuries and deep cuts on the throat, head and face.
 
 CCTV cameras also showed a woman doctor, who tried to save Madhukeshwar, was rudely pushed aside by the MP's associates.The Totagarara Seva Samiti, which runs the hospital, is chaired by Shantaram Hegde, the district Congress president. When the doctors tried to file a police complaint, the MP allegedly threatened them with a counter-complaint. Later, the hospital administration and the MP arrived at a compromise.   refused to comment saying “the issue is closed“.
