JAIPUR: Among those who are soon to take the   in the state to seek admission in the   (BEd) course, there is now much confusion about the ‘Other Backward Castes’ (OBC) certificate. The admission process for the BEd programme is now open. Students hoping for admission find that they might be turned down because they do not have an OBC certificate that is valid.
 
 There are at least 68 communities listed as OBC in the state. While certificates for the   and   are issued once in a lifetime and valid for life, the OBC certificates have to be renewed in three years. Under state norms, candidates must also give an undertaking that they are not part of the ‘creamy layer’ -- the wealthy in the community. Criteria for ‘creamy layer’ are listed in a schedule of the Government of India of 1993.
  
 A teacher at a BEd College, unwilling to be named, told TOI, “I have turned down some candidates because they did not have a valid OBC certificate. In some cases, the certificate was valid at the time the application was made. However, so many months later, as the admission process prolongs, some of these certificates had become invalid. We cannot admit students and then face the music later. There is also no clarity in the norms – must we consider the OBC certificate at the time of the student’s eventual admission or when he or she has first sent an application?”
  
 Neither minister of higher education Kiran Maheshwari nor additional chief secretary Rajhans Upadhyay answered the phone as this reporter called to seek clarification.
