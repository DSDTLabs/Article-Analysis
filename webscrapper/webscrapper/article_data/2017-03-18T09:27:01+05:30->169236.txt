LUCKNOW: With UP's new chief minister set to be sworn in on Sunday, the bureaucracy is all set to fall in line too. In signs that the new government wants to hit the ground running, and wants the administration similarly prepared, chief secretary   on Friday issued instructions directing all bureaucrats and administrative staff to report to work and remain available to discharge their duties effective March 20, the new CM's first day in office.

 In a tersely worded office order, Bhatnagar said the key policies and priorities of the government have to be imple mented in a time-bound manner. To ensure that happens, he has directed all departmental heads to direct their subordinate officers and staff to remain present for work.
 
 The order, which appears to be stating the obvious, comes at a time when work had slipped into the hanging-in-balance mode after the Akhilesh Yadavled SP government was thrown out of power last week.
 
 Bhatnagar has also slipped in a word of caution: those who fail to report as per the office orders may be subjected to adverse entries, indicating that the zero-tolerance policy for dereliction of duty will be in place even before the CM occupies office. Bhatnagar has also slipped in a word of caution: those who fail to report as per the office orders may be subjected to adverse entries.Typically , officers and their staff bide time to familiarise themselves with the new government's priorities and take time to reorient themselves to the new working style.
 
 This time, though, Bhatnagar has acted swiftly; in backto-back-meetings earlier this week, he directed bureaucrats to acquire copies of the Lok Kalyan  , the BJP manifesto for 2017 UP polls, familiarise themselves with what the government proposes to do after it is sworn in, and keep implementation plans ready in advance.
