 Agra: The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Friday suspended a MDS (periodontics) student, Dr Shadab Khan, who has been accused of raping a fellow student. Dr Khan has also been barred from entering the campus.   According to police, a first year student of Bachelor of Fine Arts had filed a complaint against Dr Khan on June 20 alleging that he had developed a sexual relationship with her after promising her marriage. The woman claimed that the accused was already married and that he purposefully did not disclose his marital status to her. She said that she got involved with him while undergoing dental treatment at AMU hospital. Police had lodged an FIR under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC against the accused who is current absconding.    In the wake of the seriousness of charges against Dr Khan, AMU VC Tariq Mansoor had earlier constituted a committee to inquire into the matter. On the basis of the recommendation of the committee, the university issued a show-cause notice to the accused student on July 10 and asked him to submit his reply. However, he hasn’t responded to the notice till date.    In the notice, AMU proctor Mohsin Khan stated that “it is prima facie established that the student has committed an act of indiscipline and misconduct as provided under AMU Students Conduct & Discipline Rules”.    According to the university authorities, the woman had visited AMU’s Dr ZA Dental College about a year ago for treatment and had met Dr Khan there.    Police said that the complainant decided to approach the cops after getting to know about Dr Khan’s marital status.
