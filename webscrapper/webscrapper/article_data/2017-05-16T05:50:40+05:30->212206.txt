 The district wakf board office, adjacent to the mosque near the KPTCL office, was demolished for road widening. 
 
 The wakf board could not find an alternative as the PWD did not agree to pay high rent for the new office. 
 
 Meanwhile, the state wakf board directed the district wakf board to shift the office to Sirsi. The decision is being opposed by members of the Muslim community in Karwar.
