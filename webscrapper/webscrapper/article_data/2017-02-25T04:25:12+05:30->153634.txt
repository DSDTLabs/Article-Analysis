AHMEDABAD: Bias against the girl child is more apparent in urban areas of Gujarat which have 62 fewer girls for every 1,000 boys born, as compared to rural areas. This urban-rural divide is higher than the national average. There are 18 fewer girls for every 1,000 boys born in urban India as compared to rural India.

 Census 2011 data for Gujarat released in the socio-economic of 2016-17 indicates that the overall child sex ratio (0-6 years) in the state was 890 girls for 1,000 boys while this was 914 girls per 1000 boys in rural areas. For urban areas, the figure is 852 girls for every 1,000 boys. This is around 62 girls less in urban areas.
 
  Senior officials, however, said there was improvement in the child sex ratio as compared to 2001. In 2001, there were 906 girls against 1,000 boys in rural areas while, in urban areas, it was 837 girls for every 1,000 boys. This is around 69 girls less in urban areas as against 2011 when there were 62 girls less for every 1,000 boys.
 
  The socio-economic data reveals that in Gujarat, Surat’s urban areas had the worst sex ration with 121 girls against 1000 boys in 0-6 age group, as compared to the villages. The phenomenon is equally prevalent in Navsari in   and Vadodara in central Gujarat.
 
 The officials pointed out that 2011 census revealed that in the 10 districts barring  , all the districts of South Gujarat including Surat, Navsari, Valsad, Surat, Tapi and Bharuch had fewer girls than boys born in urban areas as compared to their rural areas. The official said that apart from districts of South Gujarat, Banaskantha, Mehsana and Sabarkantha are also among the top districts with a skewed sex ratio .
 
 Officials said that the 2011 census reveals that 20% of 18,618 villages in Gujarat have a child sex ratio of less than 800. With a child sex ratio of just 886 for every 1,000 boys, the problem has gone from being an urban malaise to a rural one as well. But some village elders are trying to fight back. According to officials, the Civil Registration System (CRS) reveals that in 2011, there were 890 infant girls born against 1,000 boys. According to the CRS data for 2014 released recently, this is now 876 infant girls for every 1000 boys born.
 
 Sociologist Gaurang   said that the problems has many aspects. 
 
 “In big cities like Surat, Rajkot and even in Ahmedabad, the number of Patidars is increasing and the problem of child sex ratio is directly associated with this community,” Jani said. “Moreover, in urban areas the one-child norm is also adversely affecting the child sex ratio.” 
 
 The sociologist further said that if a family has a boy as its first child, the family usually does not have a second child. “However, a second child is accepted in the family only if the first child is a girl,” Jani said. “I also feel that in order to develop awareness for the girl child, one should have some topics in the curriculum of schools.” 
 
 He further said that skewed sex ratio is mainly due to the availability of advanced equipment for sex determination.
