PANAJI: Goa will get its first bachelor in performance arts programme from June 2018. It will be offered by Kala Academy with an intake of 30 students. 

 The four-year degree course will be affiliated to   (GU) and will have a syllabus focused on  , art and culture minister Govind Gaude said on Tuesday. The current three-year diploma in   arts at Kala Academy will be gradually phased out as the new programme is introduced.
 
 Any student, who has cleared the Class XII exam in any stream, can seek admission to the course, Gaude said. There will be no age bar on seeking admission to this degree programme. The prospectus will be made available at Kala Academy from June 4.
 
 “Preference will be given to students with experience in performing arts. In case of an overwhelming response, since the number of seats are limited, we may conduct a test,” the minister said.
 
 The programme will be run from Kala Academy premises and a principal will be appointed for the course soon, Gaude said. “To begin with, five faculty members will be appointed. The fees will be subsidised,” he added.
 
 Gaude said that as the existing programme is a diploma course, a bridge course will also be introduced from the next academic year for the benefit of students of the earlier course.
 
 “We have also got permission to start a masters programme. Students of the existing diploma programme can complete the bridge course and then join the masters course. Similarly, a graduate from any stream will be able to join the masters programme after completing the one-year bridge course. The masters programme will be introduced subsequently because currently there are no graduates in performing arts from the state,” Gaude said.
 
 The minister said that it is big step for Kala Academy to have received the nod from GU and the directorate of higher education for the graduate, masters and bridge courses. “We had been working towards it for a long time now,” he said.
