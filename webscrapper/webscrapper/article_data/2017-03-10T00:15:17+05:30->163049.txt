Gandhinagar: Congress MLAs walked out of the assembly when Dehgam MLA Kaminiba Rathod was prevented from raising the issue of atrocities on Congresswomen on International Women’s Day. During question hour, Kaminiba was to ask question on the wages for Asha workers. However, after moving the question, Rathod said that the BJP had double standards. She said that she was happy after the BJP gave them Rs 1 crore for their constituency as a Women’s Day gift. Accusing the police of high-handedness, she slammed the BJP government for “ill-treatment” of women on the International Women’s Day. The PM was in the city yesterday to address the Swachh Shakti 2017 programme at Mahatma Mandir on the occasion of International Women’s Day. “Gandhinagar police detained women Congress workers by forcibly entering a private property. They even detained a rape victim, who had come to make a representation. Is this the way to treat women on International Women's Day?” Rathod asked. This led to chaotic scenes. Rathod and another woman Congress MLA Chandrika Bariya rushed to the well of the house. Rathod was taken out of the house by women sergeants. Her eviction sparked an uproar, as Congress members started shouting anti-BJP slogans, while BJP MLAs also engaged in verbal spats with the Opposition. As the noise continued, speaker Ramanlal Vora adjourned the house for thirty minutes. Kaminiba later said that when she was obstructed she rushed into the well of the house to register her protest, but the ruling BJP used forced and dragged her out of the house.
