VASCO/MAPUSA: Cortalim MLA   Saldanha on Monday refuted all allegations that she and her family had asked for land conversions of ancestral properties in Regional Plan 2021.

 Saldanha asked voluntary organisation Goencho Avaaz for an apology for trying to malign her name at the public meet at Lohia Maidan in   last week. “Goencho Avaaz must tell me the name of the proponent of this hotel project that they are alleging in our ancestral property in the village of Cansaulim,” she said. Saldanha has demanded an apology within 48 hours or else she said that she will be forced to take legal action.
 
 Saldanha said that neither did her late husband Matanhy nor any of the heirs of the ancestral property have asked for any conversion of land. 
 
 The Aldona BJP Mandal on Monday threatened to file a defamation suit against Goencho Avaaz for making “false and baseless allegations” against Aldona MLA Glen Ticlo . The voluntary organisation had alleged the involvement of the MLA in illegal conversion of land under Regional Plan 2021.
 
 Addressing reporters at the north   headquarters, president of the Aldona BJP mandal, Franky Carvalho, said that the mandal supports MLA Glen Ticlo and “takes pride to have a representative with a clean image who is fully involved in developing Aldona into a model constituency”.
