KANPUR: When the bodyguard of a   MLA checked his account balance at a State Bank of India ATM here today, he made a startling discovery: his account had mysteriously been credited with over Rs 99 crore. 

 The guard, Ghulam Jilani Siddiqui, shouldn't have had more than Rs 73,000 in his account by his own admission, but there was no mistaking the exact amount on the mini-statement: Rs 99,99,02,724.
  
 A worried Siddiqui informed his boss, MLA  , who in turn brought the matter to the attention of the city magistrate. 
 
 It isn't clear for now whether the drastic increase in the bank balance was the simply the result of a software error, or whether there was something else behind it. 
 
 Siddiqui and Solanki plan to inform the   about the incident tomorrow.
