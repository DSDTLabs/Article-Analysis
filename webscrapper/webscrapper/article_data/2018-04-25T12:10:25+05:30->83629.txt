INDORE: The 65   including, women and children, who were caught on Monday from a city-based hotel, were granted   by district   on Tuesday.

 The women were arrested under Section 76 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, for engaging children in begging. They belong to Pali and Jodhpur districts of Rajasthan. The court granted them bail since they showed unawareness about the law and its implications and also agreed to the condition of not repeating the act in future. They were later produced before Child Welfare Committee.
 
 “The women, who had allegedly forced the children in begging and were using the infants for alms, have furnished an affidavit regarding not repeating the act in future. We are also writing to our counterparts in Pali and Jodhpur district to ensure that the children go to school and not do begging in future,” CWC chairperson Maya Pandey said.
 
 The committee will also request police to purchase tickets for journey of the women and the children to their respective places in Rajasthan and also send two constables, including a female cop with them.
 
  “A change in the society is needed to stop begging. Those, who give alms to help the needy, should donate it to government and help in proper rehabilitation of such people,” district collector Nishant Warwade told media-persons.
 
 Acting on a tip-off, a joint team of police, Childline, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and department concerned had caught 65 beggars, including 48 children, from Vijayshree Hotel near Sarwate bus stand on Monday. They were kept at Bhikshuk Griha in Pardeshipura area.
