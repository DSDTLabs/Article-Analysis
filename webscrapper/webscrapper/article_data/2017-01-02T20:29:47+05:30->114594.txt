CHENNAI: Children’s Park in Guindy, which had remained shut after   hit Chennai on December 12, was reopened on Friday. 

 “Around 7,000 people, including children, visited the park per day after it was reopened,” a senior wildlife official told the TOI on Monday.
 
 The officer said Vardah had brought down more than 250 trees in the park and damaged the periphery wall in some places. 
 
 The cyclone also damaged a few enclosures. It took close to 18 days to clear the fallen trees from the park premises. The tree waste had been dumped in the park itself, said the officer. 
 
 Some of the stumps have been converted into benches. 
 
 However, repair of the periphery wall, relaying roads and repairing and renovating damaged enclosures will take some more time. “At least we need two more months to complete these works,” the officer said.
 
 The officer said they plan to reopen  , which lost more than 10,000 trees, before Pongal festival (mid-January). “The zoo lost its total green cover in the cyclone. It may take at least another decade for getting back such a beautiful green cover on the zoo premises,” the officer said.
 
 The fallen eucalyptus trees were taken away by the Tamil Nadu Paper and Boards Limited. Other trees were being removed, he added. 
 
 No animals in the Children’s Park and the zoo had suffered injuries during the cyclone, he said.
