PATNA: Mohd   runs a famous mutton shop at Sabzibagh in Patna. He sells 400kg of mutton every day; on   morning alone, he sold 2,500kg of mutton.

 Indeed, the festival of colours, for which non-vegetarian dishes are a must on the menu in most households, saw the chicken and mutton sellers laugh all the way to the bank.
 
 “That Holi was celebrated on Friday also proved advantageous for us. Had it fallen on a Tuesday or Thursday or Saturday, the sales would have not been this much as many avoid non-veg items on these days,” Qureshi explained to TOI and added the mutton, normally priced at Rs 500/kg, sold for Rs 600-700/kg on Holi eve and Holi day.
 
 Anticipating heavy rush,   opened his shop at 4am, instead of usual 8am, and sold around 700kg mutton by Friday noon. 
 
 Chicken too was in demand. Broiler chicken, which is normally sold for Rs130-135, sold for Rs 140-210 on Friday. Imteyaz Qureshi’s chicken shop at Sabzibagh alone sold 20 quintal of chicken on Friday. On normal days, the sales do not exceed four quintal.
 
 However,  , who has his chicken shop at Hanuman Nagar, was not overwhelmed even after selling 400kg of chicken at the rate of Rs 140/kg. “Chicken sales have declined after prohibition,” he rued and recalled he used to sell at least 700kg of chicken on Holi before prohibition.
 
 Nala Road homemaker   was happy it was a Friday. “Non-veg items are a no-no for my family on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. This Holi, however, we had mutton curry and butter chicken among the dishes prepared for the day,” she said.
