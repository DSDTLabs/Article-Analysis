 They were found when police and the victims’ families found their footwear nearby around 10pm. “It is suspected that the victims were fetching water from a   close to the trench. One of them may have gone to help the other who fell, but both drowned. No one could have noticed them as it was dark,” said the police.

The fire brigade, which was called to the spot, found the bodies. We are awaiting tender papers given to the private contractor to carry out work. Also, a probe is on to know the safety measures and whether barricades had been used. Based on a BMC report, further action in filing an FIR and arrests will be decided,” he said.
