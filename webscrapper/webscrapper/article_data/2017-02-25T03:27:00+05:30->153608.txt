Margao: The newly formed Goa Highway Affected Vendors Association (GHAVA), an umbrella association representing wholesale and retail   vendors, as well as owners of hotel, restaurant, bars and taverns affected by the recent Supreme Court (SC) order banning them from operating within 500m from national and state highways, has exhorted the government to join hands with other affected states and file a review petition challenging the constitutional validity of the SC decision before a larger bench. 

 During a meeting organized by the Salcete Liquor Traders, Taverna and Bar Owners Association at the Grace church hall, Margao, on Friday afternoon, GHAVA’s legal counsel, advocate Amit Palekar, requested the state government to “take the matter seriously and adopt a more proactive approach, similar to the mining crisis in Goa”. Palekar stated that there are over three lakh individuals whose livelihood is directly or indirectly dependent upon the liquor trade.
 
 Pointing out that the government ought to seek a relaxation of the SC order, Palekar said, “After the assembly election results are declared on March 11, the new government can either amend the Goa Excise Act or bring in an ordinance so that the SC decision is not applicable to the state of Goa, like Assam has done. ”
 
 Stating that excise commissioner Menino D’Souza’s action of issuing show cause notices to bars seeking renewal of their licences was “hasty, resulting in a panic situation, specifically in view that the SC decision is to be implemented only from April 1 onwards”, Palekar urged the bar owners to challenge the notices issued to them in the Bombay high court at Goa. 
 
 GHAVA president Dattaprasad Naik and Bardez Bar Association president Michael Carrasco were among those present.
