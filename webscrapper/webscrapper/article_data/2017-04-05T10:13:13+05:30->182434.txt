DEHRADUN: The Dehradun district magistrate has directed chief medical officer of Dehradun,  , to shut down   in the city.
 
  Two dozen labs in the city which have been flouting norms are under the scanner. DM Ravinath Raman issued orders to this effect after members of the   alleged that three dozen illicit labs were running in the city and urged him to take action.
  
  Talking to TOI, Thapliyal said, “We have a list of 24 pathology laboratories which are not operating according to the guidelines of the health ministry. We will be taking legal action against them. The list has been provided to us by the district administration hence it will be a collaborative exercise which will include police as well as sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) of the respective areas.”
  
  Thapliyal said, “The labs are flouting various norms. They either do not have a   to run the lab or use substandard quality reagents to conduct tests which leads to false reports. Some labs do not have a hygienic environment. The degrees and qualifications of the staff operating such labs do not meet the criteria of the health ministry in many cases.”
  
  In 2016, the CMO had raided illicit pathology laboratories after local residents alleged that pathology lab owners had been charging exorbitant prices for ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) testing. The residents had demanded regulation of prices across all private laboratories.
  
  A team from the CMO office had raided the laboratories and found that some were being run by unauthorised and underqualified technicians. In some cases, MBBS doctors instead of qualified pathologists were running the labs. Some of the facilities were using expired drugs for tests. Six labs had been issued notices asking them to submit required documents within three days.
