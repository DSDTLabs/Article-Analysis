Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Monday asked the state to stop the salary of the Block Development Officer (BDO) of Khanakul in Hoghly district if he failed to disburse the one-time   amount of Rs 25,000 to Rupali Dutta within seven days. Dutta, a first-year student coming from an economically backward family, had to drop her studies because the district administration disregarded her claim for the money.

 The order came after the state lawyer, following the court’s order on February 6, submitted that Dutta’s claim was genuine and it was only disregarded because of dilly-dallying by the district administration. The complainant had to marry even because she didn’t get the money so that she could continue her studies. A fuming Justice Debangshu Basak asked: “Is it possible?” He then directed the state to stop the BDO’s salary if Rs 25,000 is not given to her.
 
 Dutta’s case dates back to 2014 when she was a first-year student of Raja Rammohan College at Radhanagar in Hooghly and had applied for the one-time Kanyashree amount of Rs 25,000, which CM Mamata Banerjee had announced for all girl students who wanted to pursue higher education.
 
 “Though my client applied for the money in 2014, but it came up for verification with the BDO and SDO in 2016 and they sat on it for another year. In 2017, Rupali was informed that the system has been closed. Rupali had leave her dream for higher education midway. Her family members arranged for her marriage and now she is a resident of Jagacha in Howrah district,” Rupali’s lawyer Suvanil Chakraborty said.
