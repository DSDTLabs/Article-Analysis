 Businessman Navneet, who is travelling with his family to Pune from Mathura, said, "The wait has been endless with the Jhelum Express being delayed for more than nine hours. The facilities in the train are not up to the mark and we are now hoping to reach Pune only by 9pm on Friday," he said over the phone.
 
 Kundan Singh, who had booked a ticket on the Duronto Express, said, "The train was supposed to arrive from Nizamuddin at 6:15am, but it arrived at 11am. Then, it left Pune station after 12pm. The fog is in the north, but why was the train delayed in Pune? Singh asked.
