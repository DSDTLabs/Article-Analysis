Director Adarsh H Eshwarappa’s  , which deals with the issues that women face in the society today and women empowerment, has been enjoying a good run at the box office, despite it having to go head-on with other big-budget releases. The movie is going strong in its fourth week, with theatres adding additional shows.

  “We survived the storm. Two big films released after Shuddhi and we are the only ones who have survived. The response has been really good; in fact, people are complaining that there aren’t enough screens to watch the movie in. We have been getting repeat audiences — people who are watching the film 2-3 times. And surprisingly, a lot of mothers and daughters are also watching the film. We are seeing family audiences and they look thrilled when they walk out of the theatres. We didn’t expect that,” says Adarsh, who still visits theatres to personally see the audience reaction to his film and get feedback from them.
 
  Shuddhi will soon release overseas as well — it is slated to release in the US next week, where it will be screened in 40 locations. There are plans to release the film in Europe,  ,   and the   as well.
