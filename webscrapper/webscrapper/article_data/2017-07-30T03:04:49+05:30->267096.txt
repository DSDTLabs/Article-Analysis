MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee on Saturday asked Governor   to quit on moral grounds for collapse of administration in the once prestigious Mumbai University.

 Congress spokesperson   said as Chancellor of Mumbai University, the governor has failed to ensure smooth administration so he should accept responsibility and quit. Sawant alleged Sanjay Deshmukh was selected as vice-chancellor owing to his allegiance to the RSS and proBJP organisations. Sawant said while education minister   and minister of state for education Ravindra Waikar should quit, Deshmukh should be sacked immediately.
 
 Meanwhile,   called on the governor at   to brief him on the delay in declaration of results. “I briefed the governor on the debate in both houses of the state legislature as well as the meeting convened by legislative council chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar.
