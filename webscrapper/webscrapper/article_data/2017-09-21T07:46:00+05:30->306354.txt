Ghaziabad:   from over 16 villages in  , whose lands have been acquired for the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, met district magistrate   on Wednesday. 

 The farmers have long been demanding a service lane on both sides of the 24.5-km stretch of the expressway falling in Ghaziabad, which the NHAI has turned down. 
 
 “Wednesday’s meeting with farmers was held in the presence of NHAI officials to deliberate on their demands of service lanes on both sides of the expressway. I have written a letter to the NHAI to look into the matter,” Maheshwari said. 
 
 Salek Bhaiya, a farmer, said: “Our demand is not unreasonable. Without a service lane, we will face a lot of difficulties in transporting our farm produce.”
