PANCHKULA: Home guards from across   continued their protest at  , Panchkula, on Tuesday, demanding that they be hired as permanent employees by the state police. 

 The protesters also demanded that the state government must increase their salaries. The home guards said they had been taking these two demands up with the state government for long, but no steps had been taken to date.
 
 The president of  , Vikas  , said the duties of a home guard were just like that of police constables and they were made to serve the same amount of hours, but there was disparity in pay and they had also not been given permanent employment. 
 
 "There is a shortage of personnel in Haryana Police. If the state hires us, the force's shorthandedness will be taken care of too," Ranga told TOI. "The department will also save money spent on training newly hired constables, as we have been working for   for a long time now."
 
 Ranga added that home guards found it tough to get by because they were underpaid. "Often, our bills go unpaid," he said. Even as the home guards protested, traffic on Housing Board Chowk was affected because of the agitation. Diversions caused by the protest gave a tough time to protesters. The role of the home guards is to serve as an auxiliary force to the police and assist in maintaining internal security, but protesters said there was no difference between the job roles of a home guard and a constable.
