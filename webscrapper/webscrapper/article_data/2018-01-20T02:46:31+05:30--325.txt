NEW DELHI:   has announced that the   for   and   will now be conducted through   at various centres. The circular released on January 17 reiterates an order passed by the varsity on December 22, 2017. About 300 students get PhD and 500 get MPhil degrees from JNU every year.

 However, JNU Teacher’s Association (JNUTA) has called it a “ludicrous proposal” and claimed that the university lacks infrastructure to conduct this procedure. The teachers also claimed that viva voce conducted through the digital medium will adversely affect the process, adding that the administration’s move is anathematic to “meaningful research”.
 
 The notice issued by the university said that the procedures will be conducted in halls and rooms “equipped with proper infrastructure” and that members of the research advisory committee of the student concerned should be present along with the external examiner.
 
 JNUTA members claimed that most centres of the university do not have any such rooms. The CIS has one hall equipped with such infrastructure and “3-4 viva voce examinations will have to be held there every day making the process a mere formality. It will be neither instructive nor rewarding for the students or examiners.”
 
 The teachers’ association also pointed to the circular that said that no reimbursements will be made to external examiners and because of that “the class of examiners will be restricted to just the metro cities and institutions that have internet connectivity.”
