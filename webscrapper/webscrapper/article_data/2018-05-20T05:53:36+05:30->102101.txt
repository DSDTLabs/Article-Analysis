PANAJI: Goa police on Friday arrested two British   for allegedly creating a   at Goa Medical College ( ) and hospital over the issuance of death certificates. 

 Agasaim police inspector Uday Gaude told STOI that they arrested Sultan Autvan, 31, and Anil Sandhu, 28, both residents of London. They were subsequently produced before a magistrate and secured bail. 
 
 Police said that one of the accused’s father expired at GMC’s intensive care unit (ICU) on Friday, and that the family decided to conduct his last rites on Saturday. The deceased, police said, was treated at a private hospital before he was shifted to GMC. 
 
 When the family demanded the death certificate of the deceased person, GMC staff said that it would take 15 days as per procedure. 
 
 
 
 
 Police said that the accused persons thought that the death certificate would be issued instantly or within a few hours. 
 
 When the GMC refused the instant issuance of the death certificate, Autvan and Sandhu brought some food items, kept them on the table of the head clerk at the medical superintendent’s office, and started eating and using foul language. GMC staff tried to explain the procedure, but it was all in vain. The two accuseds began screaming and shouting at GMC staff, and this scene went on for at least an hour, investigating officer Anil Polekar told TOI. 
 
 Then, the police were called, and the two were taken to Agacaim police station. On Saturday, police visited GMC, recorded the statements of staff, and conducted a panchanama. Polekar is investigating.
