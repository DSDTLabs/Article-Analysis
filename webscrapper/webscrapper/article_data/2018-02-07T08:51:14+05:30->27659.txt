JAIPUR: The   (SHRC) has asked the state government of the reasons of the public being left to the mercy of the illegal 'agents' and 'consultants' at the   and no provision has been made for help desk or enquiry at the transport department for the convenience of the public thronging the offices. 

 The commission has asked additional chief secretary ( ) and commissioner, transport, to reply to the queries by April 9.
 
 The commission in a suo motu cognizance of a news report of public being looted by the agents to get works done at the transport department in connivance with the officials asked the department whether these so called agents and consultants have any legal sanctity. The transport department though denied any legal sanctity to these agents; the commission noted that the public at large is being left with no option but to approach these agents as there is no other way left by the department to get their work done in RTOs as there is a nexus between the agents and the officials.
 
 The commission noted almost five years has passed after the commission sought a report after taking cognizance of the news reports and despite the knowledge of the officials at the highest level of this illegal practice, no corrective action has taken or suggested so far by the department showing its insensitivity and callous approach.
 
 The commission expressed surprise that despite vast section of the people are being inconvenienced and looted by unscrupulous elements working in tandem with the   in the department, nobody seems to be bothered.
 
 The Transport department has failed to reply why it is not considering setting up of   and consultation centres at the RTO offices and also registered agents and consultants for the convenience of the public.
 
 The commission noted that the reply by the transport department shows that it was unconcerned and insensitive about this problem.
 
 "It seems the state government considers human rights commission as a consultant to reform some departments by suggesting guidelines as no official wants to accept responsibility for their decisions."
