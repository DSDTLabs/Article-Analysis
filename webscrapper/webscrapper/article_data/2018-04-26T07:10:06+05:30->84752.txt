PANAJI: The fate of the   master plan, a 25-year vision document for development of  , hangs in the balance with repeated delays in finalizing the plan. Proposed to be completed in nine months in 2015, it is far from complete. Though three modules of the plan are ready and the fourth, a tourism policy, awaits approval of the government, there has not been much progress after that. 

 The committee that oversees formulation of the master plan has not met for the last two months and the scheduled meetings had been cancelled a couple of times at the eleventh hour, a source said.
 
 "We don't know why everything is on hold and things are not moving, while there has been already so much delay in finalizing the plan," a tourism stakeholder said.
 
 Another stakeholder, who was instrumental in pushing for a tourism master plan to be prepared for Goa, said he is "disappointed" that it has taken over two years to get the plan ready.
 
 "After so much delay, we are not sure if the government will effectively implement it once it is ready. I have my doubts," he said.
 
 President, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), Savio Messias said he was not aware about what was happening about the tourism master plan. "We have not met for the last two months," he said. The modules submitted has recommended strengthening of laws, guidelines for tourism projects, quality labelling and support schemes to expand the tourism market.
