MYSURU: Traffic signals at more than a dozen intersections across Mysuru are out of order, causing hardship to thousands of  . 

 If people blame the apathy of traffic police for the situation, the men in white attribute the delay in supplying smart signal lights. Police claim exiting pre-timed signal lights are being replaced with  , a Malaysian technology, and this is causing the problem. Signal lights at two intersections near Muda, one each near SDM-IMD College, Shanthala theatre, Dhanvanthri Road-Dewanâ€™s Road junction, Kantharaja Urs-Krishnaraja Boulevard junction have been defunct for four months.
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) K N Madaiah told TOI that at 20 junctions, the signal lights have been removed and are being replaced with smart signals lights so that monitoring vehicles become easy for police. All pre-timed signal lights will be changed and perhaps Mysuru will be the first in Karnataka to have these automatic signal lights, he said. Hyderabad has such smart signal lights. 
 
 Currently, signal lights are pre-timed and even though there are no vehicles on the particular stretch, vehicle users at the other end have to wait till the signal turns green. The automatic signal system would reduce the delay by adapting to fluctuation in traffic flows as signal switches on and off automatically based on density of vehicles. Here, every signal light is fitted with cameras which records density of traffic and changes signal accordingly. 
 
 Under the M-track scheme, city police are upgrading signal lights at a cost of Rs 4 crore. All 52 signal lights will be changed with automatic signal lights and 30 lights from   have been received.
 
 Metro Net Communications, Bengaluru, will install the lights and a meeting has been scheduled with city police chief AS Rao on May 2 to discuss the progress of the  . Disclosing that smart signal lights have arrived in Mysuru, Madaiah said traffic signals across Mysuru will be soon set right.
