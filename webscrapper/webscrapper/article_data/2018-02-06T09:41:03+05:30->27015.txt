SURAT:   (SMC) has claimed that it will become self-sufficient in terms of compost or manure required to maintain its 172-odd gardens by the end of 2018. 

 Moreover, it plans to generate revenue by sale of excess compost to the citizens.
 
 The civic body further claimed that by using   to produce compost, the amount of solid waste dumped at landfill sites could reduce by 15% over the next couple of years.
 
 SMC collects nearly 600 metric tonne (MT) of organic waste, including dry leaves, mowed lawn, pruned branches, dead floral waste, and others from its 172   annually. All these waste from the garden is brought to compost facility set up near 22 large gardens across the city. 
 
 The waste collected is spread out in layers with cow dung, soil and water. It takes nearly 90 day for one batch of green waste to decompose into rich manure.
 
 “The manure obtained from SMC’s facility is used for nourishment of plants and gardens across the city. Nearly 50% of our total requirement of manure is fulfilled from these facilities,” garden superintendent, SMC, Dr S J Gautam said. 
 
 “By the end of this year, the amount of compost generated will double, so we won’t need to buy organic manure from the market,” he added.
 
 SMC commenced the   from October last year and in three months they have been able to produce 50% of the total requirement of the city.
 
 “We will be able to produce about 600 tonne of compost in a year for which we will be spending Rs 5 lakh. Whereas if we purchase it from the market, it will cost about Rs 30 lakh. Besides good quality compost, we will save on solid waste disposal as this material gets reused on the spot where it is generated,” said Gautam adding that they plan to sell the additional manure to citizens at a reasonable rate.
