CUTTACK:   (OHRC) has sought a report from superintendent of police of Mayurbhanj district over the mercilessly thrashing of a minor boy, who was nabbed for stealing by locals in Udala area in Mayurbhanj district on May 2.

 The commission has directed the SP recently to inquire into the matter and submit his report within four weeks. The commission has fixed the next hearing of the case on June 19.
 
 A human rights campaigner Akhand has moved OHRC seeking stringent action against the persons who took law in their hands and beat and tortured the minor boy for his mistake. The petitioner has alleged that a minor boy was caught while allegedly stealing a bag containing money Rs 15000 from a person near High School Chhak in Udala on May 2. Locals caught him and thrashed him brutally. The mob rained punches and slaps on the minor boy, due to which the boy sustained severe injuries also.
 
 The petitioner has alleged that police failed to do its duty properly and protect the minor as it reached the spot late. Even after reaching the spot, the policemen made no serious efforts to rescue the boy from the mob. Akhand alleged that people dragged the minor boy on road and tortured him while police stood as mute spectators. “This inhuman act of some people is a not only a shame for civilized nation and but is also a serious offence. Action should be taken against the people who took law in their hands and tortured the minor and also against erring policemen for their inaction,” said Akhand.
