GODHRA/VADODARA: Nothing seems to come in the way of friendship and bond that   and   share.And they mean serious business when they say that they are going to stick together.

 Patel and Pathan used to work for the same automobile company as salespersons. Working together, they realized that often customers took advantage of them and negotiated with both to get a good deal with the other person not knowing about it.
 
 “We decided that it would make much more sense if we came together and started our own business. We started our own venture selling automobiles letting go of our jobs as salesmen,“ said Patel. The firm established in 2000 started dealing in commercial vehicles as well as tractors.
 
 But the partnership was put to test in 2002 when a mob targeted the dealership after   carnage. “The yard located behind the office was packed with vehicles. All vehicles were badly gutted,“ said Patel, 41.
 
 The loss ran into over Rs 2 crore and the duo was in serious financial crisis. It took the business a couple of years to get out of the red, said Patel. But the thought of parting ways or winding up never crossed the mind of either of the two.
 
 “We are only looking ahead. Together, we have started two more businesses of quarrying.We are more like real brothers. The family bonding is also such that we can walk into each other's homes without intimation,“ said Pathan, 39.
 
 Pathan pointed out that communities in   depend on each other for businesses. “For example, a bulk of the transporting business is with the minority community while trading is with other communities. This is true even in the agriculture sector where most greens and other items are transported by members of the minority community,“ he said.
