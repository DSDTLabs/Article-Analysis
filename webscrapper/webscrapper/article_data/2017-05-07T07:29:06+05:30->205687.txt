HYDERABAD: An   at the Government  ,  , on Saturday allegedly due to  . The baby allegedly developed complications soon after birth. 

  NGOs on Saturday claimed that two infants died due to negligence. However, officials confirmed just one death. The death of the infant led to mild tension in the hospital.
 
 Superintendent of the government maternity hospital, Sultan Bazar,   could not be contacted despite several attempts. The director of medical education Dr   said that the mortality cases in the maternity hospitals mostly occur because children are brought to government hospitals in critical condition. 
 
 "If a child is born with some congenital problems and brought to a government hospital in the last stage, the baby is likely to succumb to the severe health problems within the first 24 hours. The problem that we face here is that in most maternal cases, the women turn up at the last moment. There is case history maintained whatsoever. Many a times, they would have been kept at private hospitals till the last moment and when the case gets complicated, they are admitted to government hospitals," she said.
 
 Apart from the fact that the most complicated cases are referred to at the government hospitals and patients often come at the last moment, lack of infrastructure in government hospitals also contributes to the mortality rate. Doctors and other health staff point out that they are overburdened. "For a 170-bed capacity hospital, the number of patients dealt with daily is around 1,000, adding to the chaotic conditions," said an insider.
