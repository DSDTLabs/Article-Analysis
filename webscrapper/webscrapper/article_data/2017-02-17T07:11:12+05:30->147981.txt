KOZHIKODE: Veteran CPM leader   has demanded the immediate arrest of   of Educational and Charitable Trust chairman P Krishnadas and others who were named as accused in connection with the  . The first-year BTech student of Nehru College was found hanging at the Nehru College of Engineering’s hostel in Pambady last month.

 The administrative reforms commission chairman addressed the media at Jishnu’s house at Valayam near Nadapuram here on Thursday. Achuthanandan’s visit came amid the criticism raised by Jishnu’s parents. They were upset that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan did not even visit their home to condole the death of their son.
 
 “We cannot have a situation in which heads of self-financing colleges, who evade arrest and move around freely even after an FIR is filed against them by the police, are presented with a chance to take anticipatory bail from court,” Achuthanandan said in a statement issued after his visit.
 
 He added that all those involved in the death of Jishnu can be brought before the law if the accused in the case are arrested and questioned immediately. “The information received from students of Nehru College and their parents makes one think that the college is actually a concentration camp. The parents of Jishnu explained what’s happening there. Jishnu was the latest victim of the harassment by college management that banned political activity on campus. The management illegally levied fines and harassed students mentally and physically,” he said.
 
 He also asked the government to take steps to recover the forest land allegedly encroached by   and Research Centre and demolish illegal constructions there.
 
 On Monday SIT – probing the death of Jishnu – had filed a report in Wadakkanchery court arraigning Krishnadas and four others as accused in the case. They have been charged with abetment of suicide, criminal conspiracy and forgery. All the accused are absconding.
