MADURAI: For all practical purposes, the May 23 order of the central government imposing restrictions on   and regulating live stocks market has become operational since Friday, as   refused to extend stay on is operation any further.

 When a PIL against the notification came up for further hearing before a division bench of Justice K K Sasidharan and Justice G R Swaminathan on Friday, first the bench refused to extend the stay order, and then a different bench would hear the matter next, since Justice Swaminathan had argued the case as assistant solicitor-general, representing the Centre, during the admission stage of the case.
 
 It all started when a PIL was filed by S Selvagomathy and Asik Elahi Baba from Madurai challenging the constitutional validity of Rules (22) b(ii) and 22(e) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulations of Live Stocks Markets) Rule of 2017. A bench of Justice MV Muralidharan and Justice CV Karthikeyan had granted interim stay of the operation of the notification for a period of four weeks, on May 30. 
 
 On June 28, the case was heard by another division bench comprising Justice A Selvam and Justice N Authinathan, which adjourned the matter till July 7, after the central government sought time to file counter-affidavit.
 
 Now the matter is before a third division bench which refused to extend the stay on the operation of the central notification regulating the sale and purchase of cattle for slaughter in animal markets.
