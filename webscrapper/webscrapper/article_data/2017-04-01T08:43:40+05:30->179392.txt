IDUKKI: Even as   fill headlines, it is alleged that the   is dragging its feet in taking action against  . 

  In January, Devikulam sub-collector Sreeram Venkitaraman had submitted a detailed report on encroachments at Pallivasal and sought urgent action. But the government, until now, has not taken any steps to reclaim the land.
 
  The report pointed that large-scale land encroachments had happened at Pallivasal in the last 30 years. Of about 190 acres of land owned by the   near Pallivasal power house, over 40 acres were encroached by outsiders and sold to private parties for construction activates.
 
  It said former revenue and KSEB officials were involved in the encroachment as they had submitted fake documents to the revenue office and collected title deeds for the land. The KSEB officials have not submitted any relevant records for the encroached land it is suspected that the original records have been destroyed.
 
  A detailed inquiry is needed to know about the title deeds and the status of the land, the report added.
 
  Many resorts were constructed on the encroached land. Now, there are over 30 resorts, with most of them having eight to 13 storeys which is not acceptable in an economically fragile area like Pallivasal, the report said.
 
  Pallivasal is considered to be an area with high chances ,of land slide. On March 13, a rock fell near a resort at Pallivasal, severely damaging three parked vehicles.
 
  "I have submitted a detailed report and now the ball is in the government's court,"   told TOI.
