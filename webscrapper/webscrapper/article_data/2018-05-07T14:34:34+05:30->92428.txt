 “Salman had been granted bail on April 7 by the sessions court and an appeal against the sentence had been moved by us in the same court, allowing which, the court had directed Salman to remain present on the day of hearing in the court”, said his counsel Nishant Bora. Salman had been sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment by the trial court on April 5, convicting him in a case of poaching of two blackbucks in Kankani on October 1-2, 1998.
 
 All the co-accused including Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Tabu, Neelam and one Dushyant Singh, however, had been acquitted by the court providing them benefit of doubt. Salman’s counsel had moved an application in the sessions court for suspension of his sentence and bail, which had been allowed by the then judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi just the day of his transfer was announced.
 
 Following the development, Salman was released from the jail on the condition that he will appear in the court on May 7 and will not leave country without any permission from the court”, said the prosecution counsel Pokar Ram Bishnoi.
 
 “Now the decision of the court in the light of the arguments will decide whether his application will be rejected or not. If rejected, Salman will have to go back to jail and the only way out will be to appeal in the high court,” Bishnoi said.
 
 In a similar case of poaching of a blackbuck in Mathania’s Ghoda Farm, Salman had been sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment by the trial court and appeal against the same had been rejected by the sessions court, after which, he again had to go to the jail and relief had been granted to him only after he had moved the high court.
