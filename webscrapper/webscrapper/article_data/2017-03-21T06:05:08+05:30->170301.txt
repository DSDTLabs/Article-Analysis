LUCKNOW: Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences has listed out five   for   to save them from  . 

 Included in the newborn screening programme, the tests are performed at a very nominal cost in nine centers of UP. But doctors at   feel that till the programme becomes universal, parents may ask their doctors to take up these tests. 
 
 The list of tests includes congenital hypothyroidism, the commonest cause of mental retardation. It affects 1/1000   in India. 
 
 “If not detected within two weeks of birth, it can lead to mental retardation which has a huge socio-economic burden on the parents but if diagnosed timely, the problem is 100% manageable and the child will grow into a normal adult,” said Dr Vijaylakshmi Bhatia, paediatric endocrinologist. 
 
 She said a number of private hospitals have started offering these tests and parents should not miss the opportunity. The newborn screening programme is available in Lucknow at SGPGI, KGMU, Ram Manohar Lohia, Veerangana Avanti Bai, Veerangana Jhalkari Bai and Rani Laxmi Bai hospitals. 
 
 “Universalisation is essential to save kids from disability and disease and many developed countries have included 30-35 tests for the baby while in India five tests, including for congenital hypothyroidism are essential,” said Dr Bhatia. 
 
 The other conditions included in the programme begins with G6PD deficiency, in which the body doesn't have enough glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or G6PD enzyme needed for normal functioning of red blood cells.
