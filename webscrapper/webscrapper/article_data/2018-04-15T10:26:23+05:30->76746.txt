MAPUSA: After his maiden visit to the Mopa airport site, civil aviation minister  , who is also the Union minister of commerce and industry, said the Centre is framing a policy to expand air cargo handling in the country that would create more employment and revenue.

 The airport at Mopa is going to be the cargo hub of India and would be operational in 2.5 years, Prabhu said, adding that cargo movement will be easy in Goa as it has good road connectivity and navigational facilities. 
 
 “Cargo is one of the great revenue earners and also contributes to the growth of trade and economy. We will make sure that cargo movement will be another thrust area for development. In India, there are not many passenger flights at night and hence, airspace is available which can be used by cargo planes,” Prabhu said.
 
 Prabhu, who has been asked by PM   to look into logistics as a subject earmarked for the commerce ministry, said the speed and cost of movement of air cargo are key in global and domestic trade.
 
 “Air cargo will play a key role, particularly for perishable products. We are also trying to tie up with some countries for export of fruits and vegetables,” Prabhu said, adding, “India produces 380 million tonnes of agricultural produce and 400 tonnes of horticulture produce and despite being the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables, India loses 30% of it before it reaches the market. Part of that which is being lost can be exported and this will lead to a significant rise in farmers’ income.” 
 
 The Union minister said the airport at Mopa will be a hub for southern India because the entire west coast of India can be serviced from here. Prabhu said the Centre is also considering Goa as a startup hub and he has already discussed the matter with state IT minister Rohan Khaunte.
 
 He said that with the rise in urban population, the government is mulling the idea of introducing chopper services to reduce congestion.
