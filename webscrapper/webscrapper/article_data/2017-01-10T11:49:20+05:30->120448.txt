Sonakshi and Dev are in their resort room and arguing. She tells Dev that he doesn't understand how she feels about not becoming a mother ever. Dev tries to explain her things and hugs her. She moves away. He kisses her. The two consummate.
 
  In the morning, Sona asks Dev to go back home. Radha on the other hand, is as usual brainwashing Ishwari against Sonakshi. Dev calls Ishwari to tell her that they are on their way back.
  
  The two enjoy the drive while coming back.
  
  
 
  
  Ishwari waits for Dev and Sona. Bejoy and Asha also reach their home. Radha suddenly starts yelling at them and calls Sona's parents selfish. She says their son Saurav planned it all to take money from Dev. Asha asks Bejoy to keep calm and not say anything.
  
  Radha continues to insult Bejoy. Bejoy asks Ishwari why is she silent? Ishwari says she agrees with Radha and blames Saurav for plotting it all.
  
  Dev and Sona get back home and see everyone yelling. Bejoy asks Dev if Saurav forced him to give money. Dev clears it all by saying that Saurav did not ask for money and he has invested in his business instead.
  
  Bejoy continues shouting at Ishwari. Dev loses his cool and slaps him. Everyone is shocked to see this.
