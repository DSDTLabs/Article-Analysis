NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a PIL seeking an independent probe into the death of   trial judge B M Loya, which the petition alleged to have happened under suspicious circumstances. The court will hear the matter on Friday.

 Loya died on December 1, 2014 in Nagpur where he had gone to attend a wedding. He was the CBI judge hearing the   fake encounter case, which was transferred by the Supreme Court from Gujarat to Mumbai in September 2013. The next trial judge acquitted Amit Shah and others in the fake encounter case on December 30, 2014.
 
 The PIL was mentioned for urgent hearing by advocate Anitha Shenoy before a bench headed by CJI Dipak Misra, who agreed to post it for hearing on Friday. Interestingly, a PIL filed by Bombay Lawyers’ Association seeking an inquiry commission headed by a retired SC judge to look into Loya’s death is pending before Bombay high court.
 
 After a news magazine recently published a report claiming suspicious circumstances around Loya’s death, his son Anuj Loya and Bombay HC judge Justice Bhushan Gavai had said there were no unusual circumstances to the death of the CBI judge. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave had said Loya’s death had occurred in “extremely suspicious circumstances”.
