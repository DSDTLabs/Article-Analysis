HYDERABAD: Indian shuttlers need to punch above their weight to make a mark at the   mixed team championship which gets underway in Gold Coast, Australia on Sunday.

 Ranked ninth, the team led by   is clubbed with Indonesia and Denmark in Group1D. Just one victory in the group stage is enough for them to advance to quarterfinals.
 
 The championship has been a tough proposition for India as they have made the knockout stage only once in 2011. Though the Indian team is buoyant about their chances it is difficult to seem them beyond group stage.
 
 "We are confident of doing well this time. We have a very good chance of getting past the group stage," said Sindhu, who is expected to win her singles matches with ease.
 
 The five-match rubber comprises men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles and mixed doubles ties and a team has to win three of these five ties.
 
 India face formidable Denmark on Monday and Indonesia on Tuesday. While it is difficult to beat Denmark, India are fancying their chances against Indonesia. But for Sindhu's women's singles match, the rest four may be tougher for India.
 
 Depending on the conditions, India's highest ranking singles shuttler   or   will play the men's singles.
 
 There are high hopes on women's doubles team - Ashwini Ponnappa and   - to pull off one point for India.
