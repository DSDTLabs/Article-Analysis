MADURAI: More than a month after around 20 trekkers died in a forest fire in Theni district of  , the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday granted advance bail to   who is alleged to be the organiser of trekking. However, the court granted bail on condition that he should not leave the country till the investigation is over.

 The trekkers were caught in wildfire in   forests on March 11. The fire claimed 23 lives. Apprehending arrest, Peter Van   filed an advance bail petition in the court.
 
 When the petition came up for hearing, Geit’s counsel submitted that the petitioner had not committed any offence as alleged by police. However, the petitioner was being sought to be fixed and framed as a scapegoat just because he is a foreigner with no roots in the country.
 
 The petitioner was not the organiser of trekking and sightseeing for teams from Chennai and Erode. The team led by informant   from Erode and Gelt were Facebook friends. The Chennai team was organised as a women’s day special trek by Divya Muthukumar and Nisha Tamiloli who invited participants from Chennai Trekking Club through e-mail.
 
 The petitioner is in India on an yearly employment visa since 1998. Geit, who is a marathon runner and trekking activist is one of the trustees of the Chennai Trekking Club (CTC). Because of his active and selfless involvement in various social activities he is known as a key person in the CTC.
 
 He participated in three-day marathon event from Chennai to Puducherry that started on March 9. He was in no way connected to the trekking event, the court was told.
 
 The counsel said based on misinformation, police have come to a conclusion that the petitioner was solely responsible for the loss of lives. There was a chance for him to be treated badly in the event of his arrest. Hence, he might be given anticipatory bail, he said.
