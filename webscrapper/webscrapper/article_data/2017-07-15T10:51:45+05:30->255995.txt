PUNE: Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( )-appointed   that note down   readings of consumers will face criminal cases if their staff was found to be   and makes mistakes, thereby causing hardships to consumers.

 Sanjay Taksande, regional director of the distribution company, set forward the instructions during a meeting with directors of meter   agencies. Pune zone chief engineer M G Shinde also attended the meeting.
 
 A statement issued by the distribution company mentioned that after the agencies jot down readings, staff of the distribution company visit at least five per cent consumers on the same day to cross check if the notings are accurate.
 
 Taksande said that as compared to the earlier process, it has become much easier to take accurate meter reading because of the facility provided in the power company’s mobile application. However, it was found that many agencies deliberately noted inaccurate readings despite the fact that the power company’s employees were cross checking their work by personally visiting the location and checking the readings.
 
 The senior official added that the incorrect meter readings cause financial loss to the company. Moreover, consumers have to visit the distribution company’s offices to get the bills corrected, thus causing them inconvenience.
 
 He said that agencies not doing the job efficiently are ordered to pay a fine and are also blacklisted. In fact, now onwards, criminal cases will also be filed against guilty agencies. He stated that, if found to be negligent, even the power company’s employees and officials won’t be spared. 
 
 Taksande pointed out that it was the duty of the distribution company to provide accurate bills. “When we are using the most modern technology to note meter readings, our task has been made very easy. Inefficiency will not be tolerated. All agencies concerned have been told to improve their performance or face the music,” he said.
