ALLAHABAD:   Nitin   on Tuesday suspended trainee sub-inspector S K Nigam on the complaint of   (BJP)   from Chail (Kaushambi) Sanjay Gupta that he had intentionally seized his SUV after towing it from his residence located in Civil Lines. 

 The SSP has also directed the SP (High Court) to conduct a probe into the charge levelled by the MLA. 
 
 The MLA claimed that his vehicle had collided with a bike reportedly belonging to a review officer (RO) posted at high court on Monday evening when his driver along with nephew were taking it back from the parking. Following the incident, both the parties had heated arguments.
 
 The RO reportedly made a call on Dial 100 and a PCR van reached the spot and pacified both the groups. In the meantime, the review officer reached the Civil Lines police station and lodged a verbal complaint.
 
 When the MLA, who was in the state capital, came to know that a trainee sub-inspector had towed the car from his house without even caring to lodge a proper complaint, intimated the Chief Minister about the incident. The CM subsequently summoned the DGP and asked to take necessary action in this regard, the MLA told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 The MLA on Tuesday also met ADG (Allahabad zone) SN Sabat and SSP Tiwari and demanded action against the trainee sub-inspector.
