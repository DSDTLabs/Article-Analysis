Jalalabad: Tension prevailed in   town of Fazilka district ahead of a ‘bandh call’ given for Sunday to protest against the Supreme Court’s “dilution” of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

 A group from the Dalit community has given the call. Some members of upper-caste communities met at a temple here on Saturday and decided to extend support to Dalit groups, but said no establishments and the markets would be shut down. Fazilka SP (detective) Mukhtiar Singh also convened a meeting with leaders of both sides to ensure peace during the bandh. Later, some activists from the SC community reportedly dumped heaps of garbage in front of the gate of the house of a leader from the general category, which led to tension in the town. Fazilka DC Isha Kalia said situation was tense but under control in Jalalabad. “No one will be allowed to disturb peace in the area,” she said. tnn
