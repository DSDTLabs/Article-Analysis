DALTONGANJ: In an   launched by  ,   (PDS) dealers will now gift each other a  ,in case they forget to   on time. 

 Ranjan said, "December 31 was the last day for the registration of the license renewal process, which is undertaken every year. Nearly two dozen dealers did not submit the forms this time, so I asked them to gift one dustbin to one another, instead of paying the fine."
 
 On non-payment of fine, which leads to loss of revenue to the state exchequer, Ranjan said, "The fine amount is very nominal and if it is replaced by a dustbin, it will only encourage participation in the Swachhata Abhiyan."
 
 He added that four of the nearly two dozen errant dealers are reluctant to gift dustbins and officials are trying to motivate them.
 
 The dustbins will continue to be the property of the dealers concerned and they will be free to position it at places of their choice.
 
 Ranjan also said that the disposal of the garbage in the dustbin will be looked after by the dealers.
