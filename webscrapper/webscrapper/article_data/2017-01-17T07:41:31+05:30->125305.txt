ITANAGAR:   on Sunday suspended the  , whose workers had   the state party president's office on Saturday. 

 The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the state core group, disciplinary committee members and state office-bearers, a party release said on Monday.
 
 The meeting condemned the ransacking of the state party president's office "in the strongest terms" and unanimously resolved to suspend the party workers for "gross violation of party discipline", BJP media in charge   said. The mandal president and the rest of the mandal office-bearers have been barred from attending official meetings and programmes during the period of suspension of the mandal.
 
 The disciplinary committee will also look into the involvement of any other party office-bearers in the incident and take a call on the future course of disciplinary proceedings.
 
 Hours after the induction of three new ministers in the Pema Khandu-led cabinet on Saturday, a group of angry youths and supporters of   MLA Tage Taki had allegedly vandalized Tapir Gao's office. Besides Gao's office, no other portion of the BJP head office was damaged and no persons were harmed during the incident.
 
 "The disappointment and frustration among dedicated party cadres after the cabinet expansion on Saturday is understandable. However, we have to remember that the choice of members in the cabinet is at the sole discretion of the chief minister. We all have to place our faith in him. With faith, comes the humble acceptance of his decision," Taki said.
