LUCKNOW: Bangarmau BJP MLA  , who was booked by the UP police on Thursday following nationwide furore over rape 
  in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Unnao, was taken into custody by the   (CBI) from his Lucknow residence in the wee hours of Friday.

 
 The CBI's early morning move came a day after the Allahabad High Court came down heavily on 
  over Unno case, asking it whether it proposes to arrest accused MLA as promptly as it does in other cases.
 
 A CBI team along with UP cops picked him up from an Indiranagar residence of his kin at around 4:30am. 
 
 Sengar was taken to the CBI headquarters in Hazratganj in Lucknow
 
 His family said he had planned to leave for Varanasi for a visit to temple last night but was asked by the CBI to join the probe.
  
 The CBI officials confirmed that he has not been arrested so far.
 
 CBI sources, however, said the agency has registered three separate cases, equivalent to three FIRs of rape, assault on Unnao girl's father and counter assault on the MLA's aides.
 
 The UP government's move to hand the three cases of alleged rape of the woman, custodial death of her father, was taken after the   constituted under Additional Director General of Police (Lucknow zone) Rajeev Krishna, to look into the matter submitted its report to the government on Wendesday evening.
 
 While the MLA told TOI that the girl had been tutored to build a rape case against him following her abduction last year and family dispute over village supremacy, the survivor and her kin pressed for his arrest for fear of destruction of evidence.
 
 Several audio and video evidences involving the girl, her uncle and rape survivor have surfaced over the past few days.
