 The standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation ( ) has approved a proposal to pay the compensation. “We have to give the compensation in cash to many of these affected people. Now the approval has come and the disbursement of funds will start this week,” said Anil Mule, the head of PMC’s land and estate department.
