AHMEDABAD: As many as 80 schools of the 238, for which the Fee Regulation Committee ( ) of   has approved fee structures, have registered their objections to the approved fees as they find it too little to meet with their requirements.

 It is not the school managements alone who are unhappy with the provisional fee structures. The parents, on the other hand, have found the provisional fees too high. Of these 80 schools which have objected to the fixation of fees, parentsâ€™ association in 10 schools have approached FRC and demanded a revision in the fee structure claiming the FRC has been too liberal in approval of fees.
 
 FRC has till date declared fee structures for 238 schools in 10 districts falling in Ahmedabad Zone. It has approved less fees than the proposed ones for 116 schools.
 
 Since the school managements and the parents have sought a revision in fee structures, the FRC will hear them once again and a revised fee structure will be declared again, sources said. This fee structure will remain provisional and is liable to be challenged before the appellate authority.
