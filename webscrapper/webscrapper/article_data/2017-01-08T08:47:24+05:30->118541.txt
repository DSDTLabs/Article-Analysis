HYDERABAD: A Hyderabadi man, whose South African wife is facing trouble to get an Indian visa, tweeted external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on Friday, for help.

 Swaraj responded at 10.56pm on Friday, saying, “I will check up tomorrow and find out why our High Commission in South Africa is not letting the Bahu in?“ Since Saturday morning, the minister has been working to reunite the couple, forced to live in separate continents due to visa issues.
 
 The applicant,  , a tech entrepreneur, married Monica Lisa Bradshaw in Johannesburg in March 2016. Monica applied for an Indian visa then but was denied the same. Santosh gra duated from IIT-BHU.
 
 “We approached the Indian High Commission in Johannesburg in June 2016. Even after months of follow-ups and waiting, we didn't receive any significant updates and were told that updates from the home ministry in Delhi were awaited,“ Santosh said.
 
 Pleading that the issue be sorted, Monica wrote an email to the Consulate General of India, Johannesburg, saying, “I am eager to get to India as soon as possible. My husband has just returned to India because his   expired.“
 
 Ever since Santosh returned to India in November last year, he has been struggling to solve the issue. “We're living in uncertainty , as we can't decide where to reside. We're suffering emotionally and financially,“ he said.
 
 Santosh had earlier tweeted Swaraj in October 2016, but got a response only after his second attempt on Friday. Relieved by Swaraj's response, he is hopeful that her intervention would solve the problem.
