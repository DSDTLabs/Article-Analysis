NOIDA: The father of  , the Class IX girl who allegedly committed suicide at her home in Noida, said on Monday that he would approach the Supreme Court seeking a   inquiry into the death of his daughter.

 Flanked by the father of the eight-year-old boy who was allegedly killed by a senior student in a Gurgaon school,   said he would start a nation-wide movement to “save the daughters of India.” 
 
 “Nearly 30,000 people from Bihar will come to Delhi for a protest,” he said. “If required, we will go to the PMO or India Gate,” he added.
 
 On being asked why he was not approaching a local court, he said it was a national case. “My daughter has left the world and she has been sexually harassed and you are saying it was not a national case,” he said.
 
 While police have sought evidence from the family to support allegations of sexual harassment, he refused to share any with police. “We will provide evidence in the court and not to police. If I have to give evidence, should I give to police or in court,” he asked.
 
 Claiming that Ekisha had complained about the alleged molestation by the social studies teacher in November and December, he said he initially told her daughter that the teacher might be trying to “encourage her.”
 
 “She said that he would not look at her but would try to come near her on finding her alone. She would say that he would repeat “you are a failure” and that “you are dumb”,” he told mediapersons during a press conference at his home in Sector 52.
 
 He alleged that once when she was having periods, she was denied a sanitary napkin by the school and was slapped at least eight-ten times by a teacher for coming late to the class from the washroom.
 
 “She went to the bathroom and took almost 15-20 minutes to return. But the teacher got angry and Ekisha was made to stand on a bench for half-an-hour by that teacher in front of her classmates. She came back crying. There is no humanity in the school,” he alleged.
