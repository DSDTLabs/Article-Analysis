THANE: Underworld henchman   (51), who was arrested in a 20-year-old murder case last week, is said to be close to some politicians, police said. Parveen, a close aide of global terrorist   Ibrahim, was picked up in connection with the murders of two cable operators. 

 Cops are planning to investigate his links with politicians. "Parveen is close to politicians not just from the state but also from Uttar Pradesh. He has posted several pictures of himself with an MLA from Mumbai. There are also pictures of him with other politicians at social events," said a source. 
 
 On Tuesday, the holiday court remanded him in judicial custody. Some Mumbra residents told TOI that Parveen was active during the   elections and was seen meeting several local politicians. Parveen was deported from Dubai in 2004 and arrested for his role in illegal construction of Sara-Sahara shopping complex in Crawford Market, constructed allegedly at the behest of Dawood by his brother Iqbal Kaskar. 
 
 In the 1998 killings of two cable operators-Mohammad Bangdiwala (38) and Parvez Ansari (41)-all the accused except Parveen were arrested and tried in the case. The six accused-Shaukat Khilji, Gaffar Kalia, Mehmood Arab, Mohammad Hajihasan, Makbul Hamid and one Firoz-were acquitted by the sessions court. 
 
 On August 31, 1998, around 9.45am, apart from Bangdiwala and Ansari, a 13-year-old girl Roshan Ara Khan was also injured. 
 
  Ansari's brother Sajid Ansari had successfully contested a Thane civic body by-election in 2015 on NCP ticket.
