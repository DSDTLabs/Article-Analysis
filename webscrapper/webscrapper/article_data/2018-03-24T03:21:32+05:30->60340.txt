NEW DELHI: Pandit  , the kathak maestro, will protest for justice to the 14-year-old Noida girl who had committed suicide allegedly after being harassed by teachers at Ahlcon Public School, Mayur Vihar. 

 After Ekisha Sah’s father, a disciple of the Padma Vibhushan awardee, approached his guru to appeal for a   inquiry,   Maharaj assured the family that he would speak to the Prime Minister about transferring the case to the central agency.
 
 On Friday evening, Ekisha’s family members went to the classical dancer’s house on Shahjahan Road. “The child was gifted and did not have any reason to take this step. I have taught her father and sometimes guided her as well. It is unlikely that she will commit suicide without provocation. There should be a probe into this incident,” said Birju Maharaj. 
 
 “I do not know whether having a CBI probe gets justice for the family in such a situation, but I will definitely do everything to stand by them,” he added.
 
 Ekisha’s family members said that so far they hadn’t heard from the school or the police regarding the role of the accused teachers. “Apart from invoking POCSO sections, there was no other communication. This is not something one expects when your child dies because of someone’s behaviour. We want the teachers to be arrested immediately,” said the victim’s mother. 
 
 Birju Maharaj has also promised to accompany the girl’s family to hold a peaceful protest at a location of their choice. 
 
 “It hasn’t sunk in yet that the child is no more. Her family members are like my own family, I will provide them with all the support they need,” said Birju Maharaj.
 
 Saswati Sen, another student of Birju Maharaj who has been supporting the family, thanked everybody who had joined them during the protests in Mayur Vihar on Thursday.
