LUCKNOW: The executive committee of Lucknow municipal corporation (LMC) on Monday decided to waive the interest component of all pending   bills if the owner has a valid reason for not being able to pay house tax till date and carries proofs to validate the same. The new rule will be applicable to all first-time tax payers who didn’t pay tax because of disagreement with LMC’s tax inspectors over tax assessment of their properties. However, they would have to pay the arrears along with current tax.

 Since past many years, LMC has been facing finance crunch due to poor tax collection. From a total of around five lakh properties in municipal jurisdiction, it collects tax only from about 50% properties regularly. The latest assessment reveals that more than one lakh properties are still left out of tax ambit. Officials said that most cases are pending because of disagreement over tax assessment while few are disputed.
 
 In case of bills pending for long, the interest part has become too large because of the compounding of interest every year and as a result the owner is reluctant to pay hefty amount. LMC has decided to settle such cases finally. It will verify the claim of owner, cross-check with documents, letters written to LMC to verify his intention to pay tax regularly and then waive interest component of pending bills if his complaint is found genuine.
 
 But, LMC still doesn’t plan to crackdown on those who were evading house tax for years on the pretext of differences over tax assessment. Additional municipal commissioner PK Srivastava said, “Tax collection status has been so weak this year that we needed to come up with a liberal policy to encourage people to pay taxes. We cannot be strict with everyone in the first place. We have to create awareness among people to become conscious enough to pay tax every year. Crackdown is not a solution.”
