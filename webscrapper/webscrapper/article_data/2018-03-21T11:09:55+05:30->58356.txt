CHANDIGARH: Hitesh Puri, who owns a shop near the mobile market in Sector 22, hesitates to use the subway near the ISBT to commute to Sector 17. Puri finds the subway, connecting the sectors 17 and 22, quite shabby and unsafe, even during the day time. 

 He said he shifted to the market in 1996. The subway was constructed afterwards. But it was never fit for regular use, he said. He hardly uses it as the area is not cleaned up by the MC staff properly.
 
 Puri, who is also the vice-chairman of Federation of Sectorsâ€™ Welfare Association of Chandigarh (FOSWAC), said few years ago the association also raised this issue with the authorities, but to no avail as no action has been taken to improve the condition.
 
 During a visit to the area, the commuters said they hesitate to use the subway, which is located in the heart of the city near the ISBT.Chandigarh administration had constructed it more than 20 years ago for the convenience of the public. Residents and shopkeepers of the Sector 22 complained the civic body does not maintain it properly and security is deployed only during night hours.
 
 President of resident welfare association   said the authorities are neither maintaining it properly, nor are there any measure to ensure safety and security of the commuters who use this facility. According to him, the underpass, being located in the heart of the city, should be promoted by the authorities.
 
 There are in total 14 booths built inside the underpass built in 1997, a number of which remain shut all throughout the day. Vice-president of RWA, Sector 22, Narinder   said booths should be given out on lease, so that the subway has visitors. A considerable amount of footfall due to commercial dealings can also make the area safe for the commuters, he said.
