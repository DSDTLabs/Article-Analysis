A little later, Saphan and his relative   rode away on the latter's scooter with the body.

 Following reports in the media about the incident, the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children visited Anekal General Hospital and found the administrative medical officer had not been discharging his duty properly. The chairperson recommended Dr Muralikrishna's suspension.
 
 Health commissioner   said Dr Muralikrishna failed in carrying out his duty. “This has brought a bad name to the hospital. As there's a possibility of Dr Muralikrishna destroying evidence if he remains in the post, the government has suspended him pending inquiry,“ he said.
