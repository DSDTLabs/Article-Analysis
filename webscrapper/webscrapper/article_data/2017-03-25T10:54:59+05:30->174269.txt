HYDERABAD: For someone who played rugby for India for 11 years on the  , actor-director   knows what tenacity is. Challenges are what he loves. And more importantly, he is always scouting to find something that will keep his adrenaline pumping.  , was that someone who made him stop and say: This is it. 

 Poorna, he decided, did not deserve just a documentary. She was Bollywood box-office material.  , Saina Nehwal, Sindhu, Pullela Gopichand - all from Hyderabad, could well have spurred him to make a movie on them. However, the concoction that Poorna's story provided was irresistible for the director in him. He has acted in many films and directed one. When he heard of Poorna's story, he decided he would direct the movie himself. A tribal girl coming from a remote village scaling the Everest was a subject he would not let go of.
 
 "We shot the film in tough conditions. At high temperatures in Poorna's village Pakala in Nizamabad and also at the Bhongir fort. And then we had to shoot at freezing temperatures at Darjeeling and Sikkim," he recalled. Not that Bose had a problem. He was simply very passionate. For the film crew, it was tough catching up with him. At 15,000 feet he would wait for the crew to arrive. They had to wade through three-feet high snow.
 
 "For me, it was not taxing physically but it was emotionally. I was directing a girl who had no past but a future ahead of her. So it was my onus to get the best out of her," he said about   who plays the reel life Poorna in the film. 
 
 Rahul also plays a role in the film. He plays IPS officer, R S Praveen Kumar, who mentored Poorna to help her achieve what she did. "If one police officer could do so much to make a girl scale the Everest, imagine if we had more such officers," the 49-year-old actor-director-producer said. He said the film would challenge people to aim higher and achieve the impossible.
