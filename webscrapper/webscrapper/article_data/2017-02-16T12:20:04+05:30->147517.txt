Bhubaneswar: Prime Minister   on Wednesday thanked the people of   for their support to the BJP after the party witnessed an unprecedented surge in the number of seats following the first phase of panchayat election. 

 While addressing an election rally at Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh,   mentioned the party's success in Odisha as an example of growing support for the BJP.
 
 "The BJP was never strong in Odisha. But the results of the local level polls show the support for BJP is increasing across the state," Modi said while addressing an election rally.
 
 The Prime Minister further said that the results from areas, that had gone to polls after demonetisation, proves the poorest of the poor in the country has associated with the BJP. 
 
 Senior party leaders believe Modi's appreciation would provide a lot of encouragement to the cadres and motivate them to work with more vigour in the days to come. 
 
 Even though the   won the maximum number of zilla parishad zones that went to polls in the first phase, the BJP stunned everyone with its unexpected performance and pushing   to third place.
 
 Of the 188 zilla parishad (ZP) seats that went to polls on February 13, the BJP won over 60 seats as against the 36 it had got (out of a total 854 zones) in 2012.
 
 What has raised eyebrows is that the BJP has made inroads in traditional BJD strongholds like Kalahanadi, Balangir, Bargarh, Mayurbhanj and Cuttack districts. 
 
 Though the state election commission is yet to come up with the official results, initial trends show an erosion in the popularity of the BJD president and chief minister  , even though the party is well ahead of others, having won in nearly 112 zilla parishad zones. In 2012, the party had secured 154 zones in the first-phase and 651 in total.
 
 The Congress has emerged as the worst performer, with reports suggesting it having won in only 10 zilla parishad zones.
