NEW DELHI:   has requested the SC-appointed monitoring committee to stop the   drive for four months. Delhi BJP chief Manoj  , along with senior party members, met committee members on Friday to discuss the matter. The party is planning to meet Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri. 

 Blaming the AAP government and its predecessor,  , for the mess, Tiwari said, “The multiplicity of authority and successive governments since 1998 are responsible for unauthorised construction and misuse of properties, not the traders.” 
 
 The ruling AAP, he alleged, has failed to regularise unauthorised colonies. “The previous government has also done nothing. We will force the Delhi government and other agencies to complete the regularisation process,” said Tiwari.
 
 Demanding amendment of the policy on local shopping centres,  , West Delhi MP, said, “While commercial units on notified streets get 300 FAR, authorised shopping centres have an FAR of 180. This anomaly has to be rectified.” The party, he added, has also requested the committee not to carry out sealing in unauthorised colonies and villages.
 
 With the AAP government calling a three-day special session of the assembly to discuss the drive, opposition leader   has written to speaker   to discuss failure of the government in dealing with basic issues like water supply and pollution. 
 
 “The Delhi government is trying to avoid main problems of Delhiites by taking up civic issues such as sealing, which are totally beyond its jurisdiction. The corporations are already doing their best to find a legally tenable solution for the affected traders,” said Gupta.
