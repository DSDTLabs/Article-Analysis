PATNA: National Institute of Fashion and Technology-Patna’s fashion and lifestyle accessories student Preetika Singh has excelled in the World Sneaker Championship organised by Pensole Footwear Design Academy, New York. 

 Preetika was among the top 64 candidates selected for this championship following an online competition, the results of which were declared recently. 
 
 Thousands of students from across the world participated in the competition, which seeks to discover and groom the next generation of sneaker designers. “It is a big thing for me,” Preetika said and added she was waiting for the next round.
 
 Business Studies paper: Class XII students of CBSE appeared for the Business Studies paper on Thursday, which was a bit lengthy. 
 
 According to the examinees, the question paper was good, but three hours were not enough to attempt all the answers properly. 
 
 Gyan Niketan vice-principal Shailendra Mohan Jha, who teaches commerce to his school’s students, also said the paper was not difficult, but a bit lengthy. “However, all the questions were asked from NCERT books. Students who properly studied will certainly score well,” he added.
 
 Diet tips: Adequate intake of vitamins and minerals is important for physical and mental development of infants, said Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH)’s former paediatrics department head Dr Nigam Prakash Narain at a function at PMCH on Thursday. The audience comprised of medical students.
 
 Nigam also quoted experts to caution that that the effect on health in early years of life due to micronutrient deficiency might lead to serious health consequences later. 
 
 Colleges reopen: Many institutions under Patna University and Magadh University reopened on Thursday after Holi vacation. However, the attendance of students was thin and most campuses wore a deserted look.
