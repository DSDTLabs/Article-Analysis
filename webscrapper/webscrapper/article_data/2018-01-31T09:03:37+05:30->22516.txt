ROORKEE:: Overturning a CBI court order, the Uttarakhand high court has acquitted two persons who were sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with the murder of the son of a former UP cabinet minister 28 years ago. Interestingly, the deceased and one of the accused in the case were both sons of UP ministers.
 
  
  Virendra Singh Saini, the son of former UP minister Ram Singh Saini, and his associate   were awarded life imprisonment by a special CBI court in January, 2015. They were accused of shooting dead Afzal Khan, the son of another former minister during the 1989 UP assembly elections at Roorkee. The CBI court order had come 25 years after the commencement of trial in the case.
  
  However, the convicts got bail, and had challenged the CBI court order in the high court.
  
  The high court bench in Nainital, comprising justice VK Bist and justice UC Dhyani, acquitted Virendra and Rakam giving them “benefit of doubt”.
  
  Criticizing the role of CBI in the investigation, the high court said in the judgment: “By considering the entire material available on record we are of the view that discrepancies are sufficient to reach the conclusion that prosecution failed to prove its case.”
  
  On November 24, 1989, when the assembly elections in UP were on, Afzal, the son of Uttar Pradesh’s former forest minister   Khan, was shot dead after a scuffle near a polling booth at Baldi village in Roorkee.
  
  The complaint in the case was filed by  , who was contesting the election against Ram Singh Saini, the former minister of state (home affairs) in UP, from Roorkee. Afzal and his family were supporting   during that election.
  
  After the HC verdict, Rakam Singh, a former principal of a local inter college, said that he was framed by the probe agency. “Thank god we are acquitted. We will lead a stigma-free life now,” he said.
  
  The case was handed over to CBI on December 16, 1989.
