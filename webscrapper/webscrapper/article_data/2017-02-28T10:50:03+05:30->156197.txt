CHARMINAR: Garbage strewn across streets and the bad condition of roads are making life miserable for residents of   and   in the Old City.

 Garbage behind Kamatipura police station lane causes much inconvenience to motorists and passers-by. Locals say that the matter was brought to the notice of authorities concerned to remove the garbage, but no help has come from any quarters.
 
 “There is no transit dustbin along the lane and the garbage is always seen scattered on the road. The authorities should take note of the unhygienic condition in the lane,“ a regular commuter from Doodhbowli, Mohd Jaffer told TOI.
 
 Residents complained of a foul stink emanating from the garbage is causing breathing problems for children and the elderly. Many a times miscreants set fire to the garbage and black smoke engulfs the area leading to air pollution.
 
 Though civic body officials claim that the garbage is cleared every day, inhabitants urge that placing dustbins in each street or at prime locations would be a permanent solution.
