Visakhapatnam: As counselling continued for for those ranked between 41,000-80,000, technical   continued to mar the Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test ( )-2018 counselling session on its second day here on Tuesday. The problem was faced by some students at the counselling centre in Andhra University and many of them tried to avail the services of the helpline centre.

 Even on day 2, problems with the payment gateway persisted. Other problems that cropped up were server collapse and power outage, which continued for more than one and half hours in the morning. 
 
 M Narsimham, whose son was came for the counselling on the second day observed, “The morning session was chaotic, to add to the gateway glitches, the server was down and even the power went off. Things began to settle down only in the afternoon.” The officials, too, observed that the technical glitches did create a lot of confusion and trouble in the morning session.
 
 However, the coordinator for the local helpline centre, Prof K Nageswara Rao, pointed out that the technical issue is being addressed, with the help of the APCHE. He further alleged, “The problem with the gateway is partly because of the candidates and cannot be simply declared a technical problem. More important, we are helping them constantly and making sure that nobody misses out.”
 
 Regarding the new counselling centres in north coastal AP, the Prof said, “ The problem with the Visakhapatnam centre is mainly because it is always burdened. Even candidates from Vizianagaram and Srikakulam, are not going to the centres there.” However, sources disclosed that over thousand candidates from the Visakhapatnam region could have missed out on counselling due to the Gateway issues.
