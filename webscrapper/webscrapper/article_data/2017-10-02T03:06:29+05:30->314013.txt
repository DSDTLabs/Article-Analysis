Mumbai: The municipal corporation is hopeful of 200-tonne reduction in garbage load on dumping grounds on the first day of its wet waste segregation and processing initiative on Monday. Civic officials said they will know if their month-long campaign has been a success only on Tuesday.

 The   has made it mandatory for bulk garbage generators, including housing societies and restaurants, to start processing wet waste on their premises by October 1. The move aims to reduce burden on dumping grounds from the daily 7,800 tonne to 6,000 by the year end. 
 
 Civic officials have assured that they will not immediately act tough against those who are not following the waste segregation and processing rule, but will pull up those who are deliberately avoiding the task. Officials said they will continue to collect waste from housing societies and institutions, but will keep a close tab on them to find out why they are not following the new rule. The BMC will decided whether to take action against them after looking into details. 
 
  On Tuesday, senior ward officials will visit bulk garbage generators in their respective jurisdiction to monitor waste processing.
 
 Officials said they will send notices to those who neither sought a deadline extension not started processing wet waste. The BMC chief   said, “We are giving extension to those who have genuine reasons on case-to-case basis. Wet waste segregation and processing is everyone’s concern...It’s the beginning of a big movement.”
