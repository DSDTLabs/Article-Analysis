SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh cabinet has decided to fill up 200 vacant posts of   (MBBS) on local-specific contracts through walk-in-interviews. The decision comes in the wake of acute shortage of doctors and aims at providing health care to people at their door steps, particularly in rural and far flung areas.

 In a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister   at Shimla on Saturday, a decision was taken to amend the Post Graduate (PG) policy on tendering bond money for MBBS doctors pursuing higher courses like Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Diploma of National Board, Maternal and Child Health and others within and outside the state. This comes as a major relief for MBBS doctors undergoing PG courses facing hardship to get bank guarantees. 
 
 It approved appointment of two medical physicists and four radiotherapist technicians on outsource basis at the Government Medical College, Tanda to operationalise the equipment for cancer treatment. The cabinet also gave its nod to upgrade the Community Health Centre, Bagsaid to a 50-bed   in Mandi district. Twenty nine posts of various categories will also be created in the hospital.

 The cabinet also decided to procure four pulses- Dal Channa, Urd Sabut, Moong Sabut and   from the National Co-operative Consumerâ€™s Federation of India Limited (NCCF) under the state subsidized scheme by revising the existing policy, provisions and method of procurement of pulses.
