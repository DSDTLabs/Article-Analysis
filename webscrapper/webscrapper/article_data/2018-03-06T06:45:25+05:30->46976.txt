CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh girl  , 20, almost made it to the podium finishing fourth at the International   Sport Federation (ISSF) Shooting   being in Guadalajara, Mexico on Monday. Yashaswini, competing in the women’s 10m air pistol event, was in scintillating form on her way to the finals. She ended up with a score of 196.1 in the finals. 

 In the elimination round, there were four shooters out of which two were Indians — Manu Bhaker, who was a solitary point clear atop with 179, while Yashaswini was third with 177.6 points. The odds were not in favour of Yashaswini and she was eventually eliminated in the final round. Both the Indian qualifiers were rookies vis-a-vis the more experienced lot. 
 
 Yashaswini was off to a flying start hitting the bull’s-eye twice and achieving 49.1 and 49.7 in the first two rounds. However, she could not hold on to the momentum in the subsequent rounds taking 18.9, 20.3, 19.5, 19, 19.2 points.
 
 Yashwasini strategically maintained her scores in the year gone by to qualify for the World Cup. “The best five scores from the national-level tournaments are chosen and an average determines whether one qualifies or not. “To be successful in the World Cup, I had trained hard under my coach T S Dhillon,” she said. Yashaswini was hooked to shooting after the 2010 Commonwealth Games in the national capital. She idolises Greek shooter Anna Korakaki.
 
 “Besides winning an Olympic medal for her country after 120 years, she is known for her grit in the international arena. She lacked facilities, but still managed to achieve the historic feat. I want to achieve something like that for India in the Olympics,” expressed Yashaswini.
