Nagpur: The city will host the two-day 3rd national ‘Bhujal Manthan’, a brainstorming of all stakeholders on sustainable management of groundwater, on February 16 and 17. Around 2,000 delegates from across the country involved with water management are expected to attend the event to be held at Suresh Bhat auditorium. This was announced by union minister of state for water resources Arjun Singh Meghwal, who was here to see the preparations for the major event. The Central Ground Water Board has been organizing ‘Bhujal Manthan’ with an emphasis on collective interaction among stakeholders engaged in groundwater resource development in a manner which is in harmony with ecology. The theme of this national meet is ‘Participatory groundwater management and low cost artificial recharge measures for groundwater augmentation.’ “Over-exploration of the groundwater that made the green revolution possible has now led to serious issues of recharging in several parts. There is urgent need to make this limited resource sustainable and accessible to future generations”, said Meghwal. He also visited Tamasawada in Selu of Wardha district where a 3.5km long artificial water body has been created successfully tapping rainwater. Success stories of water conservation, groundwater augmentation with community participation would be shared by the practitioners. “One of the main reasons for steep decline in per capita water availability from 5157 meter cube in 1951 to 1545 meter cube in 2011 is the lack of water budgeting in planning resulting in demand exceeding supply. Participation of people and stakeholders can only address this issue”, said Meghwal interacting with the media persons.
