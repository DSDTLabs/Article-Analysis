AHMEDABAD: Hours after tweeting how his idea of Hinduism differs from that concept of ‘Hindutva’ which justifies killings in the name of religion, Patidar quota agitation leader   planned a trip to offer prayers at   at Ajmer Sharif in Rajasthan. Hardik is currently in Chittorgarh in Rajasthan to take part in an event hosted by a youth forum there. He will also be visiting the Brahma temple in Pushkar. When contacted, Hardik, who is convener of the  , told TOI, “As I am in Chittorgarh, some of my friends suggested I visit the famous Brahma temple of Pushkar and some of them also asked me to visit Ajmer Sharif, and I have agreed to both.” Hardik had publicly backed former VHP leader Pravin Togadia after he was removed from the right-wing group last month.

 Sources in   said that Hardik will visit Ajmer Sharif with the PAAS convener of Surendranagar, Hasu Patel. “As Hardik has been emerging as a youth leader, he wants to create a secular image so that he can project himself as a leader of all communities,” said a PAAS leader close to Hardik.
 
 When asked Hardik said, “Many leaders had visited Ajmer Sharif to fulfil their political wishes, and even after their wishes were fulfilled. I do not understand religion-based politics and it is not my cup of tea.” He added, “I am a Hindu, but I certainly do not believe in such a Hindutva which allows people to kill others in the name of religion,”
