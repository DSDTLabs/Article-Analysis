MUMBAI: Tata Trusts, with   support, on Monday launched a Karenge Toh Hoga campaign in the Tunga village slum in   (E) to teach better waste management practices to locals and enable waste disposal in an eco-friendly manner. 

  It is an extension of   (dignity), a project started by  , targeting improvement of working conditions for Mumbai's sanitation workers. About 16,000 households in the slum are expected to participate. Speakers at the opening ceremony said that without residents' collaboration and commitment, change was next to impossible.
 
  Mission Garima programme officer Honey Bajaj told TOI, "We are joining forces with the government and community health workers (generally selected by community themselves) who locals understand and accept. They will visit households and encourage a better waste management system."
 
  A civic sweeper said locals were not swayed by short and temporary efforts from organizations they do not know, but rather by consistent reminders and education from those they trust. Community health worker, Shashikala Pawar, was more optimistic: "Awareness campaigns such as this are good for this village community. Locals leave as more informed citizens, and are more open to implementing new waste disposal habits."
