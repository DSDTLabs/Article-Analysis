MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has directed the V K   police in   not to disturb a man for holding prayer meeting in his house. 

 Justice P   gave this direction after he heard a petition from S Soundarapandian from   in V K Pudur.
 
 During hearing of the petition, the petitionerâ€™s counsel told the court that the petitioner used to conduct prayer in his house. But, the VK Pudur police was preventing him from conducting prayers. Besides, as per an earlier order of the court in another case, there was no need to get prior permission from any authority for assembly and conducting prayers in a dwelling house. Likewise, police could not interfere with the civil rights of the petitioner and harass him. 
 
 The government advocate said that based on a complaint lodged by one Paulraj, the police registered a case against three people including one Sakthivel   alias Samuvel Raj. But, no complaint was received against the petitioner who was not subjected to any harassment.
