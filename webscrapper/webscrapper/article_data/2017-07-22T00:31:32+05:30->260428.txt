Trichy: The Amma mandapam on the Cauvery River bank will be flooded with people right from the early hours of Sunday.

 People come with their family members to observe first Amavasya of the Tamil month of Aadi to pay their respects to the departed souls from their family.
 
 However, the bone-dry Cauvery will remain motionless as there is not much scope for water to be released from Mettur dam unlike last year. Authorities have decided to revive a couple of bore wells and make alternate arrangements for the event which attract people from across various places.
 
 The city corporation has raised barricades along the river bank ensuring safe enclosure for the devotees to take holy dip in the river. Special arrangements have also been made for devotees to take bath at the Amma Mandapam. 
 
 Volunteers have been assigned to collect plastic bags widely used to bring flowers to the river bank for the pooja, said a senior official. 
 
 While the Amma Mandapam at Srirangam would be the centre of attraction, places including Garudamandapam, Geethapuram padithurai, Odathurai and Mukkombu too receive considerable devotees for the pooja.
