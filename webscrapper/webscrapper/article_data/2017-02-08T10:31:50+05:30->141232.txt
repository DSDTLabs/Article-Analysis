KOLKATA: The   on Tuesday empowered the   to go ahead with the implementation of   (UAA) method for determination of property tax. The resolution was passed at a meeting held the   headquarters.

 The meeting also cleared the KMC assessment department’s decision to adopt a ‘capping system’ on the calculation of properties under the UAA method. Under no circumstances, the property tax of an existing assesse will rise more than 20%. Similarly, the civic body has made sure that its revenue doesn’t take a hit by choosing not to lower the tax rate more than 20%. “We are waiting for the state’s approval. Once we get it, we will make a publication of the UAA scheme, which will pave the way for its introduction from April 1,” said a KMC official.
 
 “Regular tax bills would be sent to assessees till they calculate their own tax and start paying it. “After calculation of property tax under the UAA, if we find an assessee has paid extra, we will adjust the amount. If an assessee pays less, we will raise an arrear demand,” mayor Sovan Chatterjee said.
 
 The state assembly in December last year passed the   (Amendment) Act, 2016, paving the way for the new tax regime. Keeping in view that the new assessment procedure may result in tax alteration, the amended act has incorporated section 171A that empowers KMC to introduce regulations to fix percentages on the valuation of different groups of properties.
