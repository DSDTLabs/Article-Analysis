BHAGALPUR: Alarmed by the attack on CM Nitish Kumar’s cavalcade at Nandan village in Buxar district on January 12, the Bhagalpur district administration has made elaborate security arrangements for the fifth leg of the CM’s ‘Vikas Sameeksha Yatra’ at Udhadih-Bhirkhurd village under Sultanganj block on Wednesday.

 Apart from Bhagalpur, high alert has also been sounded in neighbouring Naugachhia police district as well as Banka, Munger and Katihar districts.
 
 The entire public meeting venue, where the CM will address the gathering, has been divided into 14 sectors for intensive monitoring of the antisocial elements and mischief mongers by the police and intelligence officials. Altogether 160 police officers, executive magistrates and other security personnel will monitor security arrangements at the meeting venue and the routes through which the CM’s cavalcade will pass.
 
 Quick response teams have also been formed to meet any eventuality. Instructions have been issued to keep a track on those staying in Sultanganj hotels, lodges and dharmashalas. The administration has also started intensive checking of vehicles, including two-wheelers. Netas and party workers wishing to offer bouquets to the CM will have to go through frisking, sources said. 
 
 Bhagalpur DIG Vikas Vaibhav, DM Adesh Titarmere, SSP Manoj Kumar, DDC Anand Sharma, SDM Suharsh Bhagat and other officials have visited Udhadih-Bhirkhurd village several times ahead of the CM’s visit to oversee security arrangements.
 
 The DM said elaborate security arrangements have been made for the CM’s visit. “Security has been tightened at the meeting venue, helipad, cavalcade routes and places where the CM will visit,” the DM added.
