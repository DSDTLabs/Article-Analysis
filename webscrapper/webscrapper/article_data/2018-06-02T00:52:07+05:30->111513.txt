Trichy: When children from across the state received their new textbooks on Friday after the reopening of schools, students of Nehru government aided school in Amayapuram village in Manapparai were at home.

 Citing poor infrastructure, parents refused to send their children to school. They demanded that the government take over the school and the proposal for the same was under consideration. As a meeting with the parents and officials from the revenue and school education department failed on Friday to convince them to send the children to the existing school, parents did not send their wards.
 
 Nehru government aided school in Amayapuram village with more than 185 students is being run by a family for over 70 years. While the school gets aid from the state government only for five teachers and its maintenance, the school run in a single tile-roofed building is in dire need for renovation. While the present management gave up on the school, parents have been urging the state government to take over the school and by converting it into a government school. Vincent Soundararajan, the manager-cum-correspondent of the school said that he has given up his right on the school in writing to the school education department citing his inability to run the school. P Annavi, a village head said that they have demanded to operate a government school in the village with the authorities before the vacation begun, but no steps were taken nor did the authorities give an alternative place, he said.
 
 Arulanandam, additional assistant elementary education officer from Karambakudi said that they have sought a weekâ€™s time from the parents for making alternative arrangements till a order is passed.
