HYDERABAD: It sure would have been lonely at the top for Poorna who climbed the  , but in the crowded Tollywood, there seems to be not much place for her. The film is being released by PVR cinemas only in multiplexes but not in any single screen theatres. 

 "All single screens in Hyderabad and Telangana are completely booked," said M  , former president of  .
 
 While Pawan Kalyan's ' ', released on March 24, is being screened by many theatres, this coming Friday, there are two more big releases like 'Rogue' and 'Guru'. Poorna's village - Pakala in Nizamabad district - would love to watch her on the big screen, but as it appears, they will not be able to do so. Hyderabad where the film is being released is too far away for them to make a trip to watch the film. 
 
 The Telangana state government gave 100% tax exemption for 'Poorna' as it is an 'educational and entertainment film' for children. This tax exemption does not seem to be of any benefit because the film itself is not releasing in single screens anywhere in Telangana for schools to organise screening for their students. According to  , the film will be released in seven multiplexes in the city.
