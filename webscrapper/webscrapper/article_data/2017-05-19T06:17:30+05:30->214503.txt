DEHRADUN: The   (CPU) of the   “paid a staggering price of Rs 5.34 lakh to buy 60 pairs of shoes” in 2014, the year when the patrol unit came into being under former director general of police (DGP)  .
 
  The information was divulged by the police department in reply to an RTI query filed by activist  , a city resident, in 2015.
  
  According to RTI reply, the department paid nearly Rs 10,000 each for 60 shoe pairs for CPU personnel. Kumar said the shoe deal required to be probed.
  
  Senior police officers, who were part of CPU at the initial stage, are reluctant to comment on the shoe deal, saying the purchase was discretion of seniors at that time. “For the purchase, all procedures were followed. Who decided the shoe or price or the quantity was not our concern; we got shoes, and gave those shoes to CPU,” said an IPS-rank police officer on condition of anonymity.
  
  Interestingly, the Uttarakhand police are now paying Rs 2,000 each for CPU personnel’s shoes.
  
  CPU’s main focus was traffic and illegal parking in the city. “It was shocking that Uttarakhand police decided to buy 60 pair of shoes at a price of Rs 5.34 lakh, and no one raised any question at that time. This needs to be probed and the police department must look into the matter since the CPU is coming up in other cities as well,” said Kumar.
  
  The RTI activist claimed that the price of shoes were unusually high even by Army’s standards. “Even the Army patrolling in tough terrain doesn’t buy such expensive shoes. In India CPUs would be the only policemen wearing Rs 10,000 shoe,” said Kumar.
  
  Police personnel posted at police stations and on other duties wear normal shoes, and the CPU personnel, who normally ride bikes to penalise traffic violators, have been given all-weather tactical shoes.
