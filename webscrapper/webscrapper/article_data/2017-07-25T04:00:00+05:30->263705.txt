Vadodara: Twenty-five trucks used in sand mining activities were seized by assistant regional transport office (ARTO) of Chhota Udepur since July 22. The trucks have been lined up in an open plot outside ARTO in Chhota Udepur town.

 Sources said that the trucks were detained for overloading and for not having proper documents and papers. According to ARTO officials, the truck drivers were also fined for violating the laws.
 
 Vehicles involved in sand mining activity are often detained by different government agencies in the tribal dominated district. The vehicles are detained for illegal sand mining from Orsang River which passes from the district. However, the mines and minerals department which is directly responsible for monitoring the sand mining activity has hardly acted or detained vehicles.
 
 In the past too, the local police have often detained tractors and mining machines from the banks of river but these were later released since no complaints were given by mines and minerals department. ARTO officials said that they are going to continue watch on trucks transporting sand and take action against those violating laws.
