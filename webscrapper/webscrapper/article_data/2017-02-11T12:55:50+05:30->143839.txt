NAGPUR: First-time BJP MLA from Katol,  , on Friday dropped a   by asserting that he fully supported the Shiv Sena’s demand for a total loan waiver to farmers in Maharashtra.

 With the BJP and Sena falling out, and deciding to go separate ways in elections for 10 city corporations, including Mumbai and Nagpur, and 25 Zilla Parishads in the state, the Sena had even threatened to pull out of the BJP-led Devendra Fadnavis government. While none of the Sena ministers in the Fadnavis government have submitted their resignation, four of them met the chief minister and put forth their party’s demand that farmers in Maharashtra be provided relief by way of waiver of unpaid crop loans. 
 
 The Sena has been part of the state government for over two years, but raised this demand now since the BJP’s election manifesto in   has promised waiver of farmers’ old dues along with provision of interest-free loan for next crop.
 
 “This is a welcome decision taken by the party in UP. I support it wholeheartedly and urge the Fadnavis regime to follow suit in this state,” said Deshmukh. He said this was not his personal feeling but that of all farmers in rural Maharashtra, who have suffered huge losses in last four years because of bad weather or poor crop rates. “Moreover, the loan waiver and zero-interest loan were promised by the BJP during 2014 elections in state,” said Deshmukh.
 
 During the recent Nagar Parishad elections, the BJP fared rather poorly in Katol-Narkhed region that Deshmukh represents. His statement may embarrass Fadnavis but could get public support, observers believe.
