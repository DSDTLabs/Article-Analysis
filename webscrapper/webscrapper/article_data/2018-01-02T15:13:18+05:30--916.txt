AHMEDABAD: A   fined more than 200 traders Rs 1 lakh each for keeping and selling  , in food adulteration cases that were more than a decade old.

 The court punished shopkeepers, restaurant owners etc., holding them guilty of violating the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, even though they were absent during court proceedings.
 
 The court was angry at the accused persons’ absence and observed, “Law and courts in any country must not feel so helpless at accused persons remaining untraceable for years together and spending a lifetime without attending court proceedings. Courts should not remain quiet in waiting for their presence. Nowhere in the world is the situation such that the courts are so feeble that they are at the mercy of the accused persons to conduct trials.”
 
 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate S M Kanabar, who presides over the cases of food adulteration lodged by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s food inspectors, observed so when the accused persons did not appear before the court for trial after repeated summons in cases that were pending for over a decade. The accused had been released on bail, but did not turn for the trial.
 
 The court decided to hear the case in the absence of these accused persons, saying, “Nobody knows these accused. They may even escape from court after appearing before it. For years, they are hiding from the court. In such circumstances, does the court have no other option but to abate these cases after the deaths of the complainants?”
 
 After conducting the trials on the merit of evidence in the absence of accused, the court held the accused persons guilty and fined each of them Rs 1 lakh. In case of default, the court has ordered punishment of a six-month jail term. The court has ordered that the penalty be recovered by attaching the accused persons’ assets and depositing the sum with the court.
