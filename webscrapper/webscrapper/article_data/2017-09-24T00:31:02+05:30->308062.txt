Trichy: Expressing serious concern over the work pressure on police personnel, commissioner of police, Trichy, A Arun said that efforts to implement the three shift system in the police department is yet to bear fruit due to the vacancies. 

 “Police job involves a lot of work pressure and several adversities on duty. Even though there are about 12,000 new recruits to the department, vacancies prevent us from implementing the eight-hour duty system. Due to the work pressure, police personnel are unable to even participate in family functions and spend time with their families during the festival time,” said Arun at the central zone   redressal meeting chaired by director general of police (DGP), Tamil Nadu T K Rajendran at the AR Grounds here on Saturday. 
 
 A total of 677 police officers and ministerial staff from eight districts of central zone, Trichy, railway police, Tamil Nadu Special Police I battalion and other special units took part. 
 
 “Transfers are a norm for police officers. With no association to take up our issues, we put forth our problems to our higher officials and get them rectified. It is happy to note that the DGP meets police personnel in all zones,” said Arun. 
 
 Speaking to reporters, Rajendran said the newly-recruited police personnel would join duty in a couple of months. “The medical fitness process for the 13,300 newly-recruited police gets under way. It will be completed in two months time. We will inform about the next recruitment,” DGP told reporters. 
 
 Rajendran also said that the grievance meeting will be conducted in all zones subsequently. “Around 1,500 petitions were received in the meeting in south zone. We are attending to their grievances. The meeting will be held in north, west, Chennai and special units,” he said. 
 
 Refusing to answer several queries by media persons on the Anitha suicide case, the DGP said that Tamil Nadu police will file a reply to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.
