MELBOURNE: In his first-round encounter against  , a former   finalist,   had more than his opponent to contend with. The popular Cypriot's noisy fans, who converged on the outside court at  , cheered the Indian's every error, but went all quiet when he rifled winners. Bhambri had 33 to Baghdatis' count of 24. Then when he came out to serve the Indian was met with chants of 'break, break, break.' 

 The Delhi-based pro, who came through the rain-interrupted qualifiers on Sunday, and was back on court on Monday, fell 6-7 (4-7), 4-6, 3-6 in a little over two hours. The 25-year-old, who was serving for the first set in the 10th game, and was within two points of closing out, had 54 unforced errors which in the end cost him the match played in an atmosphere that resembled an away   tie.
 
 "I think that was a little bit expected, he's well-known here, a finalist, always popular with the crowds. Besides I have played enough Davis Cup ties not to be bothered by that," the Indian said. "The crowd had no effect on the match for me. I had chances, loads of them. I was up a break in the first set, almost throughout. Then I lost a close tiebreak. There are only a few points that decide matches like this. I worked very hard for this opportunity, I'm definitely not going back home happy."
 
 Bhambri, ranked 119, to his opponent's 123, said he struggled with the wind, especially when serving against it.
