NEW DELHI: A major drug cartel   in the city was busted with the arrest of   and 22kg of the drug   was seized from them. The arrested men are Lalmuankima alias Jimmi (29) from Mizoram and Ashok Kumar (45) from Delhi. The Maruti Esteem and mobile phones used in drug trafficking have also been seized.

 “The arrested duo said that they used to prepare ecstasy using ephedrine and supplied it at rave parties in Delhi, Chandigarh, northeast states and parts of Punjab. The ephedrine tablets are also mixed with drinks and consumed at discotheques,” DCP (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said.
 
 Probe over the last two months revealed that Kumar and his aide were procuring ephedrine from Zirakpur, Punjab. On May 15, a team led by ACP Akhilesh Yadav got a tip-off that a consignment would exchange hands near Dwarka. Kumar was arrested while handing over the drugs to the receiver.
 
 Kumar told the cops that he worked in a pharmaceutical company in Delhi and travelled to several states for work. He then realised that huge profits could be earned by supplying party drugs. In April, he finally found an ephedrine supplier in Jirakpur.
 
 Lalmuankima said that he had to deliver the ephedrine consignment to a foreign national living in Dwarka. The ecstasy tablets were smuggled to Myanmar via Mizoram. He used to get Rs 25,000 per trip.
