PATNA: State   workers led by the BPCC acting president Kaukab Quadri and party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra burned an effigy of PM   near Gosai Tola Mor in the state capital on Wednesday to lodge their protest over perpetual rise in the prices of diesel and petrol across the country.

 The party workers shouted slogans against the   government and demanded that diesel and petrol be brought under the ambit of the goods and services tax (GST). Workers of the   Pradesh Mahila Congress also participated in the protest. 
 
 Reacting over the hike of petrol and diesel prices, Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in Bihar assembly Sadanand Singh said, “People of this country have now understood ‘the game behind fuel prices’. Modi government might get engulfed in the fire of fuel.”
 
 Singh also demanded reduction in excise duty on petroleum products imposed by the Centre. He said during the   government, the excise duty on diesel and petrol were Rs3.56 per litre and Rs9.48 per litre, respectively. But today, the excise duty on diesel and petrol has been increased to Rs15.33 per litre and Rs19.48 per litre, leading to rise in the prices of both petroleum products, he said.
