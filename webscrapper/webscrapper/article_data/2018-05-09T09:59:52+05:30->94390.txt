BENGALURU: The  , which for the first time tried bringing out a constituency-wise manifesto, on Tuesday released Namma Bengalurige Namma Vachana (Our Promise For Our Bengaluru), offering a slew of programmes, including 50% reservation for resident welfare associations (RWAs) in each of the ward committees.

 
 The saffron party, which is hoping to win more seats in the city compared to 2013, has promised a separate legislation for ‘New Bengaluru’— Bangalore Metropolitan Regional Governance Act (BMRGA) — while promising citizens to give control of their neighbourhoods by strictly implementing zonal regulations.
 
 Union minister and Bengaluru South MP Ananth Kumar said that opportunistic politics has ruined the city built by Kempegowda and Bengaluru is plagued by a ‘3G’ problem. “The 3Gs: gundi (pothole), gunda (goondas/rowdies) and garbage are the main problems faced by the city. The development that the JD(S) and Congress combine prevented from happening will be implemented by the BJP,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 Under the BMRGA, the BJP has promised setting up of a new Metropolitan Planning Committee (MPC), integrating all agencies, including intermodality of all transport agencies and accountability of government agencies.
 
 From an annual Bengaluru “report card” to mandatory disclosure of contracts and use of public assets, the manifesto reiterated the party’s stand on corruption. Kumar said the BJP would also break the nexus between land mafia and politicians.
 
 Former deputy chief minister R Ashoka said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during an interaction with party workers, felt that Bengaluru’s infrastructure should match that of the national capital and that the party’s manifesto is also focussed on the same.
 
 This apart, the party has also promised a host of women and child safety measures.
