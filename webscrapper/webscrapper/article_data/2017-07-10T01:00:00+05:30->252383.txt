Joining movies has done little to dampen Saiyami Kher’s passion for sports. The ' ' actress, who has played badminton and cricket at state level, doesn’t miss out on watching any major leagues. She is currently in London to catch a few matches in an on-going top tennis championship, from today to July 16. Last evening, she also watched a cricket match between South Africa and England at Lords. “Roger Federer has been my inspiration and idol forever. Every year, I would plan to watch him play, but something or the other would foil it. This year, I ensured that I go. I will be watching the fourth round and the semi-final matches, for sure. And if all goes well, I might also watch Roger hit the winning shot at the finals,” she says.
