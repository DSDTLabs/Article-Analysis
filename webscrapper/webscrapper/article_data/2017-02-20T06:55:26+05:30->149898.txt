LUCKNOW: Enthusiasm across all sections of the society, supported by pleasant weather conditions, helped state capital improve its polling percentage on Sunday with around 58.50% of electorate - nearly 20 lakh out of total 34.50 lakh - exercising their franchise in nine assembly constituencies in comparison to 56.68% in 2012. However, the turnout was lower in comparison to other districts, barring Kanpur, which went to poll in the third phase. 

 As people came to vote, dressed in their best, to celebrate the festival of democracy, the motivation of elderly and physically challenged was exemplary. Many families left all their work to come together to vote in large number despite cases of voter list anomalies and inconvenience, sheding Lucknow's `laidback' tag, leaving political parties and candidates guessing as to which way the results would sway.
 
 Impressive rise in voting percentage was witnessed in six assembly constituencies, including five urban seats, in comprison to 2012. Three rural constituencies, however, saw a marginal decline. The Lucknow North constituency topped the chart registering an increase in poll percentage from 50.25% in 2012 to 56.91%, almost a jump of seven percentage point. So was the case with Lucknow west, where polling percentage spiralled up from 49.08 in 2012 to 55.98% this time. The Lucknow Central constituency where both SP and Congress have fielded a candidate despite the alliance too saw a increase from 50.91% in 2012 to 52.98% this year.
 
 Lucknow Cantt assembly constituency -- where SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadavâ€™s younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav is a candidate -- recorded only 50.98% polling. This was lowest among the nine constituencies of the districts, but here, too, the polling percentage increased as compared to 2012.
 
 The three assembly constituencies where polling percentage dipped, albeit slightly were Bakshi Ka Talab, Sarojini Nagar and the Mohanlalganj reserved constituency. In BKT, the polling percentage dropped to 66.93% as compared to 67.09% in 2012. Sarojininagar saw a dip from 59.17% to 58.98%, while in Mohanlalganj the poll percentage dropped to 63.96% from 64.72% last time.
 
 Though there was no official announcement so far, officials of the district administration said that turnout could be among highest reported in assembly elections at Lucknow after Independence. The turnout figure communicated to media in the evening was based on the reports received from polling booths till 5pm. It may increase further when final tabulation would be done because polling at some places continued till late as those who were standing in the queue were allowed to vote, they said.
