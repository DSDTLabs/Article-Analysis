 Apart from addressing the rural populace’s issues, the government also plans to include safe practices, quality of service provided by distributors and availability of refill cylinders, as part of the panchayat.
 
 Speaking on the existing issues, Sanjay Malhotra, general manager – LPG operations, Hindustan Petroleum said, “People living in rural areas are still reluctant to adopt LPG, as they are having various misconceptions.”
 
 Within 16 months of the launch of PMUY by PM Narendra Modi, the oil industry has facilitated LPG connections to some three crore beneficiaries. This includes some 11.39 lakh in Gujarat. A significant chunk of the targeted Rs 8,000 crore fund for PMUY comes from cooking gas users who gave up their LPG subsidies. According to government officials, some 1.13 crore users let go off their subsidies through the ‘Give it up’ initiative.
