PUNE: A team of   at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital removed a staggering 206   of a 28-year-old woman on Friday morning.

 The woman had been   for the past one year. After conducting tests and ultrasound, the doctors found that she was suffering from a severe case of gallstones. But they did not expect to find such a huge number of stones.
 
 Gallstones are balls made of cholesterol and salts that form in the gallbladder — a little pear-shaped organ underneath the liver that stores bile.
 
 “The stones removed were between 2mm and 8mm in size. It took us one-and-a-half hours to remove them. This is the first time that we removed   in such a large number at Sassoon hospital. The woman’s condition is good and she will be discharged in the next two-three days,” said general surgeon Vandana Dube.
 
 Dube removed the gallstone and the gall bladder through a laparoscopic surgery where surgeon access the inside of the abdomen and pelvis through a ‘keyhole’ cut, without having to make large incisions in the skin.
 
 “The diseased gall bladder was removed laparoscopically and was found to be having 206 stones. Incidence of such a large number of gallstones is less than 0.1%. Only a few cases of removing such a large number of stones laparoscopically have been reported,” said senior spine surgeon Ajay Chandanwale, the dean of B J Medical College, attached to Sassoon General Hospital.
 
 Laparoscopy surgeries are performed in very few government-run hospitals. Such a surgery can cost up to Rs 1 lakh in private hospitals.
 
 Laparoscopy surgery has advantages of having minimal complication, less blood loss, early recovery and minimal post-operative pain. The patients can be discharged immediately after surgery.
