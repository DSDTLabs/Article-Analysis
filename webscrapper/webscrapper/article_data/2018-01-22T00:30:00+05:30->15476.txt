Bengaluru: Yediyur ward in south Bengaluru on Saturday became the first among 198 wards in the city to have its own waste-to-energy plant.

 With this, the BBMP will be able to save Rs 6.5 lakh of its monthly expenditure that includes Rs 4 lakh electricity bill and Rs 2.5 lakh being spent for transportation of garbage to the processing unit in the outskirts of the city. 
 
 Located near South End Circle, the facility processes 4.5 tonnes of wet waste at the bio-methanization plant and the biogas is then converted into electricity. At present, 4.5 tonnes of waste is processed at the plant, which has the capacity to process 5 tonnes, and 250kW of power is being generated. It produced electricity to power the nearby clock tower, a badminton academy, five parks and one km-stretch of a pedestrian walkway. 
 
 Union minister Ananth Kumar, who inaugurated the plant, said: “A booklet on this model will be prepared and submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We’ll also ask urban local bodies across the country to follow suit.” 
 
  “We’ll set aside Rs 500 crore to revamp 13 defunct biogas units across the city, ” Mayor R Sampath Raj said.
