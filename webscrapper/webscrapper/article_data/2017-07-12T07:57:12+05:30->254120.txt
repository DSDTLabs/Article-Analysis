JALANDHAR: Economic offences wing (EOW) of the   is set to call a kin of a Hoshiarpur-based   leader for questioning in connection with the land acquisition scam following a revelation that part of the compensation received by one of the accused was passed on to a company, which he co-owned with the politician’s family member.

 Recently, Hoshiarpur-based industrialist Parteek Gupta was arrested from IGI airport Delhi when he was trying to fly abroad as a lookout circular was issued against him by the Punjab VB. He was brought to   by the EOW, questioned and sent to jail.
 
 Gupta had received over Rs 15.5 crore for the acquisition of his land and out of that Rs 2.5 crore were paid to a company, which was owned by a BJP leader. “We have confirmed that transaction did take place and now we need to know the related issues and the purpose,” said an official.
 
 When contacted, vigilance bureau superintendent of police (SP) Sareen Kumar said they were investigating the case further and everybody related to the distribution of money would be questioned but refused to reveal further details.
 
 Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the VB officials also questioned Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Paramjit Singh Sachdeva, who contested from Hoshiarpur assembly constituency in the recent state elections. He is not an accused in the case.
 
 Earlier, an inquiry by the VB had discovered that Rs 58 crore was paid to the owners of a piece of land as a way of compensation by the NHAI following the acquisition for widening of the national highway between Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur because a fraudulent claim was made regarding the category of land being commercial rather than agricultural.
 
  Names of three Hoshiarpur-based   (SAD) leaders also figure among 13 accused in the case, along with the then sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Anand Sagar Sharma, who has also been booked by the Enforcement Directorate, a tehsildar and a naib tehsildar.
