BHOPAL: If you can’t walk, swim, is this  . And swimming against the tide, the   is hurling himself into the   challenge.

 This 29-year-old from Gwalior has 75% disability and cannot go anywhere without his wheelchair — cannot go anywhere on terra firma, that is. Satendra represented the country in the Paralympics at Rio, Brazil, last year and has brought the state laurels at several national meets. In 2014, he was presented the Vikram Award by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. 
 
 But when Satendra contacted higher authorities in the state government, he was told that there was no policy for financial support to physically challenged athletes. “Such rejection is always my motivation. If some people in Madhya Pradesh do not feel I am worth it, then let the world know what I can do. I want to prove that disability is not a weakness but an inspiration for me and I am worth any other ‘normal’ athlete,” Satendra told TOI on phone from Mumbai. 
 
 On May 4, he will swim 36km off the Mumbai coast in the Arabian Sea as a prelude to his dream of conquering English Channel in the first week of June. His attempt has been recognized by Maharashtra State Amateur Aquatic Association.
 
 If he succeeds, he will be the first person with 75% disability to have achieved the feat. The English Channel is an unforgiving strip of water. Temperatures can drop to 6 degrees Celsius and the water is choppy. The currents may sweep you off course — one   ended up being pushed 65km. Satendra will attempt the crossing in Dover Strait — the narrowest part of the English Channel but still 33.3km across.
