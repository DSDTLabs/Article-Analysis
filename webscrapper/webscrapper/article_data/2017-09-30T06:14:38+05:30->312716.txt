NEW DELHI: As the festival season is on, Delhi   has seen more ridership. Crowd control is very important in such situations.

  officials say orders have been issued to open additional gates if needed, especially at interchange stations like   and Kashmere Gate. Rajiv Chowk station has gates upstairs that could be opened in an emergency. "We did that once during a snag. In such a situation, announcements are used to guide commuters," said CISF DG (metro) Raghubir Lal.
 
 More CISF personnel have been deployed and there's greater CCTV surveillance as well. Over 35 quick reaction team members have been told to keep an eye on passenger flow at Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate and   stations. Bunch deployment may also be used to control crowd. Stations already have anti-riot equipment and ropes to cordon off parts.
