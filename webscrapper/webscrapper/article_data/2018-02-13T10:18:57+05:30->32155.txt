AJMER: A Dalit man was forced to perform the cremation of his live-in partner alone at   village in Rajasthan’s   because of a panchayat diktat against the couple.

 Meera, 48, began living with   Bhilai, 52, almost five years ago after she lost her husband. Narayan had lost his wife almost a decade ago. When   and Narayan decided to live together, they faced immense backlash. “The villagers immediately objected to their decision and the matter went to panchayat of the village as Narayan was a Dalit and Meera a jat,” a villager said, adding that the panchayat called Meera and warned her to cut all ties with Narayan. When Meera did not comply, the panchayat issued a diktat for the couple’s social exclusion.
 
 Last Saturday, when Narayan was away, Meera fell sick and died suddenly. The village was aware of the death but no one dared to break into the house to take the body out. On Sunday when Narayan returned, the body was taken for cremation, 15 hours after Meera died.
