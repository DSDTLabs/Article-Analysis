Manali Manisha Dey is playing a housewife (Paromita) in the serial Jamai Raja. “Presently Jamai Raja is showing stories which span for a week, so I agreed to do it. The story is about dowry and my character Paromita is very upright and strong. It is a kind of guest appearance,” said Manali who is busy doing look test for the film Kuasha Jokhon today. “Serials will always be special to me as I started my career with small screen. But at present I am trying to concentrate more on films. Other than Kuasha Jokhon I am also doing a film titled Amar Bhoy with Rituparna Sengupta,” said the actress.
