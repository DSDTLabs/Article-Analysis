SURAT: Police are yet to make a headway in death of the couple whose bodies were found lying on railway tracks near   railway station on Thursday. The infant daughter of the deceased couple Deepu Prajapati (30) and   (28) is also missing since then. 

 Raliway police officials said only it is confirmed that the couple was hit by a moving train going to Ahmedabad at around 2 am Thursday. The train driver had confirmed hitting some objects in his statement to the police. 
 
 In-charge police inspector of Surat railway police station M R Malek said, “The parents of the deceased labourer hails from Madhya Pradesh and lives in Unn Patiya area of the city. Only their local contact, a man named Rakesh, was called and his statement was recorded.” 
 
 Deepu was a witness in his landlord’s wife Shantidevi’s murder case that took place on January 30. He was summoned by the police repeatedly for questioning. 
 
 The couple was living on the first floor flat of the building owned by Shantidevi’s husband  , who lived on third floor. Some time back Deepu had set up tiles at his house. 
 
 Police believe that the couple was going out of Surat when they were hit by a train. However, the reason for their sudden plan to go out of Surat was still a mystery and so is the whereabouts of their four-month-old daughter.
