DELHI: Sikh marriages in Delhi will now be registered under the Anand Marriage Act, instead of the Hindu Marriage Act as Lt Governor   on Friday gave his approval to notify the rules in the national capital, an official said. 

 The official said that after the Anand Marriage Act rules are notified in a day or two, Sikhs would not be required to get their weddings registered under the Hindu Marriage Act.
 
 "The Lt Governor has approved the file of Delhi government with regard to the implementation of Anand Marriage Act. The Delhi revenue department will now notify it," said the official of the   office, who did not wish to be named.
 
 BJP MLA   said Anand Marriage Act is being implemented in Delhi almost 110 years after it was first demanded by the Sikh community. "I am thankful to Lt Governor Anil Baijal for implementing this Act in Delhi as this was a long-standing demand of the Sikh community," Sirsa, who represents the   legislative constituency in the assembly, said.
