 Heated argument broke out between members of the two warring families, resulting in a violent face off. Gopal Lal, Kanha Ram and their aides attacked the other faction with knives and stones due to which Katta, policemen and other family members of Gupta sustained severe injuries and were rushed to the hospital. Katta succumbed to his injuries. The attackers even looted the watches, gold chain and cash from victims. They also smashed the mirrors of their cars.
