NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday adopted a  ,   by  , and reiterated its demand for an apology by CM Arvind Kejriwal.

 The resolution expressed “gratefulness” to LG for “fully understanding and sympathising with their fears” and criticised Sisodia’s comments on officers during an education seminar as “highly regressive, gender insensitive and reprehensible”.
 
 Hundreds of government employees, top bureaucrats and other officers marched for “dignity” from the secretariat to Rajghat. They were led by chief secretary Anshu Prakash. Carrying candles — real and LED — and sporting black bands, the officers shouted anti-government slogans.
 
 Once the chief secretary joined that march, the gathering remained mostly silent displaying the placards which had messages like “the dignity of employees should be protected, CM Saheb should apologise, we demand justice not attacks and total breakdown of governance”
 
 Prakash and other officers sat on the ground in front of the “samadhi sthal” and chanted “Raghupati Ragahv Raja Ram, Sabko Sanmati De Bhagwan”.
 
 A member of the IAS association said: “We are praying to god to give ‘sadbuddhi’ to our chief minister and the government. We reiterate that we will continue to work for the public and even put in more hours than required, but no meeting will be held with ministers unless a written apology comes from the CM. We are demanding a safe environment for us to work with dignity without any insecurity.”
 
 The officers refused to respond to allegations made by AAP leaders earlier in the day, saying they did not want to engage in politics. Prakash, too, refused to comment on the matter and remained silent through the march.
 
 In solidarity with Prakash, all IAS and DANICS officers have been boycotting meetings with the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues and only maintaining written communication with them.
