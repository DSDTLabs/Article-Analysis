AMRITSAR: Punjabi folk singer   is all set to help check human trafficking as the   Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has roped him in for its project ‘Blue Heart Campaign’. The move will help scores of Indians, especially Punjabis, who become victims of illegal trade and eventually land in jails or spend lives as slaves on foreign shores.

 In the recent past, more than 30 artists from around the world have joined hands against human trafficking and released an album ‘Music to Inspire’ that was launched recently at the UN office in New York by president of UN general assembly Peter Thompson.
 
 Sammy  , who owns Rukus Avenue that launched the album, said on Thursday that the proceeds of the album would go to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund to help victims of human trafficking. 
 
 Stating that human trafficking was one of the most shameful practices in the present day and was also the genesis of child labour and sexual slavery, Chand said, “As many as 168 million children works as labourers across the globe and out of which 73 million are under the age of 10. The horrifying figure itself explains the seriousness of the situation.” He also called for an urgent action to eradicate human trafficking from the face of the world.
 
 About ‘Blue Heart Campaign’, Sartaaj said it represented the plight of those who were trafficked while reminding of the cold-heartedness of those who buy and sell fellow human beings. “There are 30 million slaves and of these 80% are women,” he added.
