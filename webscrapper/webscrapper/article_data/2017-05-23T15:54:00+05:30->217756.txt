MANALI: More demand than availability has encouraged   in Manali to charge extravagant fares which could soar as high as Rs 15,000 for a round trip to Marhi which is the  , just 34km from here.

 While the actual fare to visit Marhi, depending on type of taxi, is between Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000, the cabbies are charging anywhere from Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000 just to travel mere distance of 70km in a day. A few taxi drivers are reportedly deceiving the  , who are keen to see snow-capped Himalayan peaks, and charging fares in excess -Rs 15,000. Some SUVs and passenger vehicles are taking up to eight passengers and charging Rs 1,500 per passenger.
 
 The tempo travellers having seating capacity of 11 to 14 are also charging Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per passenger. While some tourists cringe to pay this hefty amount, most tourists are happily paying without any complaint.
 
 “Tourists are themselves offering us to pay any amount and they're only responsible for hike in the fare. Demand of taxis is twice than the availability,“ a taxi driver said.
 
 Taxi drivers coming from other areas have also started to follow suit. Whoever gets the permit, charges capricious fare from the tourists. However, there are a few drivers who are not charging above approved rates. Only 1,200 vehicles can obtain permits online, except for every Tuesday when no vehicle is allowed on this road for maintenance purposes. Once a driver obtains a permit, tourists start bidding for their taxi.
 
 A permit is available after online payment of Rs 550 towards permit and congestion charges.
 
 Such is the state of affairs that according to sources, many drivers are buying the permits from agents for Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 who book the permit and the drivers are willing to go to any extent to obtain this important permit.
