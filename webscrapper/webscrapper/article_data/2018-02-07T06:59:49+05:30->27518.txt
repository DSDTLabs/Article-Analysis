 Mahesh Singh Inter College in Mall too did not have a boundary wall, hence school authorities covered windows with chart paper so that cheating material could not be passed through.
 
 Kunwar Asif Ali Inter College in Malihabad had barred parents near school premises. In other schools, people were not allowed to stand in groups or park vehicles near schools. Students coming late were denied entry at SP Inter college in Mall.
