 'Blackmail', releasing as scheduled on April 6 on Irrfan's insistence despite his announcement that he has been diagnosed with a "rare disease", drew the audience interest from its teaser.
 
 The film is poised to be a madcap comedy starring an ensemble cast of Irrfan, Kirti Kulhari, Divya Dutta, Arunoday Singh, Omi Vaidya, Anuja Sathe, Pradhuman Singh Mall and   among others. 
 
 It is produced by T-Series'   and Deo's RDP Motion Pictures.
