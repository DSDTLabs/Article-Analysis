MUMBAI:  , who has scored seven goals in the   this season, could have almost doubled his tally for Mumbai City against   at the   on Thursday.

 But the striker seemed to have left his scoring touch on the practice ground which ultimately proved costly as The Islanders suffered the ignominy of
 
 their third consecutive loss at home. Jamshedpur held on for a 2-1win which took the visitors to fourth spot with 22 points while Mumbai remained in sixth position with 17 points from 13 games, their semifinal hopes all but extinguished.
 
 Jamshedpur scored in the 37th minute when   moved from the left to the centre, nutmegged defender Gerson and shot at goal. The ball took a deflection of Mumbai City defender Marcio Rozario's heel before  's valiant attempt to clear it resulted in an own goal. It was a half where Mumbai City had virtually no chances. Jamshedput sat in front of the Mumbai defence and thanks to the skills of Choudhary, Azuka Izu, troubled the home team's backline. But things changed in the second half when Mumbai City started looking dangerous as they pushed forward with purpose.
 
 For a period of 18 minutes, Mumbai City created a string of chances that, had they all been converted into goals, would have seen Alexandre Guimaraes' side triumph by a comfortable margin. Instead Balwant put on a show of how to miss goals from open chances. He headed wide, headed straight to the goalkeeper, shot straight at   as the frustrations of the home support rose.
 
 Mumbai City did find an equaliser in the 79th minute through   who headed in from a corner kick. But five minutes later, Bikas Jairu scored from a rebound after Kervens Belfort's effort was blocked by Mumbai City goalkeeper Amrinder Singh.
