VISAKHAPATNAM: The combined trade potential of India,   countries, Australia and New Zealand could potentially involve 40% of the world’s population, 33% of the global GDP and over 40% of the world’s trade volume, said experts at the India-AseanPartnership Meet at   on Saturday.

 Alok Dwivedi, deputy director general of Directorate General of Foreign Trade, said a presence in Aseanregion would ensure a larger reach into other parts of Asia. “Asean is the gateway to Philippines, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia. This would help India realise its aim of becoming a manufacturing and trading powerhouse,” Dwivedi said. He further added said India is strong in the area of services, while the   is rich in manufacturing and resources. Dwivedi said the trade would be mutually beneficial and added that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) policy would provide India the much-needed impetus to push its brief in the region. Dwivedi also said a mutually accommodative and beneficial tourist circuit could be built in the region, which would help tap into the tourist potential along India’s east coast and the north-eastern region of the country.
