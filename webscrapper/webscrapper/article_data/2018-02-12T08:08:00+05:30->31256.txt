INDORE: High-tech grid   will stop   and tripping related issues in  , state   Paras Jain said at the inaugural function of the state’s first gas insulated sub-station in Indore on Sunday. 

 “The project has been done three months before its completion period of two years,” said the energy minister adding that another such sub-station will be installed in Ujjain district soon.
 
 “We have encouraged participation of public representatives so that we can come to know about the basic problems of power consumers,” he said reiterating that the government is working on to ensure 24x7 power supply across the state.
 
 Detailing about the working of the high tech sub-station, Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd managing director Akash Tripathi said the sub-station uses sulphur hexafluoride gas as primary insulator and it maintains atomic and molecular properties even at high voltage. “It requires less space than the normal air insulated sub-station,” he said. 
 
 Tripathi also urged private colonisers to adopt this technology. “Though it is a bit costly, it occupies only one third of the space compared to traditional air insulated sub-station. Moreover, it is enabled to give more efficiency in term of load management, he added. 
 
 Lack of adequate space for installation of a sub-station in Malwa Mill area forced the discom to introduce this modern indoor sub-station. “As the area is very densely populated, it was not possible for us to acquire a huge space for installation of a traditional sub-station. After this we decided to install this new high-tech sub-station as an experiment. It requires around 5000-6000 sq ft area to set up a traditional air insulated sub-station while this new sub-station will hardly take 2,000 sq ft area,” he said.
