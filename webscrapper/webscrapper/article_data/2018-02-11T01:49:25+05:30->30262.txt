GURUGRAM:   JP   on Saturday ordered a probe into the reported medical negligence at  , where a 25-year-old woman delivered a baby in the open in front of the emergency ward on Friday.

 Taking cognisance of the lackadaisical attitude of doctors and medical personnel at the hospital, Nadda said the incident was highly unfortunate. “I have asked the officials concerned to submit a report on this matter to me. They have also been asked to ensure that no such incident happens in the city ever again,” said the Union minister.
 
 On Friday, the woman, Munni, delivered a baby girl in a cycle stand on the hospital premises, after she was sent off by a doctor to get an ultrasound done before admission and the test was denied in the absence of an Aadhaar card. Later, chief medical officer BK Rajoura suspended on-duty medical officer Dr Mohini and staff nurse Manita for denying an immediate admission to the pregnant woman and sending her for a test that was not crucial at that moment.
