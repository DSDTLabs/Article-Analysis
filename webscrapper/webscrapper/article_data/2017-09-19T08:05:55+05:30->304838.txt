LUCKNOW: A  , released by UP chief minister   on Monday on the eve of the completion of six months in office, has blamed the Samajwadi Party government under   of ignoring minorities, saying that it left a major portion of financial allotment for them unspent. 

 While releasing the 24-page White Paper on the functioning of   and BSP regimes,   said his government will probe the wrongdoings of the previous governments.
 
 The CM said his government will also release its progress report on Tuesday to highlight its development and welfare schemes.
 
 While the White Paper lambasted both SP and BSP, it was more critical of the Akhilesh government. Under Akhilesh Yadav, Rs 4,830 crore out of the total budget of Rs 13,804 crore remained unused, which could have been used for the welfare of minorities, the White Paper stated.
 
 Presenting data, the CM said that UP’s debt rose 2.5 times in the last 10 years — from Rs 1.34 lakh crore in March 2007 to Rs 3.74 lakh crore in March 2017. On an average, debt per person increased from Rs 7,795 to Rs 17,097 in the same period.
 
 Presenting statistics to point towards the ‘dismal state’ of public sector units (PSUs), Yogi said that 65 such entities suffered losses worth Rs 6,489.58 crore in 2011-12. These losses rose to Rs 17,789.91 crore in 2015-17, while the collective losses of PSUs in 2011-12 stood at Rs 29,000 crore which rose to Rs 91,000 crore in 2015-16.
 
 The White Paper also accused SP government of arbitrary distribution of Yash Bharti awards. It stated that the SP government bestowed the honour on some non-deserving personalities, citing the instance of an anchor whose name was cleared without following the due selection process.
 
 Further, the White Paper alleged that illegal mining under SP regime caused a loss of over Rs 477 crore to the state. The paper mentioned that the cost of under-construction Jai Prakash Narain International Centre in Lucknow jumped from Rs 265 crore to Rs 864 crore, adding that many items were imported from abroad even when they were available in the country at lower prices.
 
 Similarly, the White Paper stated that the SP government’s budget for Janeshwar Misra Park in Lucknow rose from initial Rs 168 crore to Rs 367 crore during construction. Quoting the paper, CM claimed that state incurred losses of around Rs 3,000 crore in 2015-16 and around Rs 5,000 crore in 2016-17 due to faulty excise policy.
 
 The White Paper said no significant progress was made in the energy sector during the regimes of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati.
 
 It flayed the Mayawati government for escalated expenditure on the construction of Dalit memorials and parks. Against the approved budget of over Rs 943 crore, the BSP government spent over Rs 4,500 crore on these memorials, the White Paper stated.
 
 Analysts said this was the first time in at least 30 years that a government in UP has issued a White Paper on the ‘misrule’ of the previous regimes.
