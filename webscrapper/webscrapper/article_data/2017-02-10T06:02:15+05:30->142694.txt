SURAT:   (SMC) plans to run a 24-hour   for the people of the city.  , which runs 114 buses on 14 routes including those deployed on   (BRTS), proposes to increase the fleet strength to 400 in another 45 days. 

 “Bus services on new routes would be announced by February 15. All the 275 new buses should start plying on city roads by March 15. Our idea is improve the mass transportation system. This would help reduce the number of private vehicles on the roads. We would start new bus routes looking to the demand from the people,” said M Nagrajan, special deputy commissioner, SMC.
 
 The city bus service starts at 6 am and continues until 10 pm. Many passengers travelling to Ahmedabad in Gujarat Queen that departs from Surat station at 5.30 am and Flying Ranee at 5.20 am for Mumbai are forced to pay exorbitant charges for auto-rickshaws. People returning to Surat in Flying Ranee from Mumbai at 10.30 pm and Gujarat Queen by 11 pm similarly are fleeced in the absence of a dependable bus service. 
 
 “We are planning to run early morning and late night services. Direct buses from Dumas to railway station via all main roads would be introduced soon,” Nagrajan added. 
 
 SMC plans to introduce single ticket by March-end. “People would be able to travel on one ticket from any place and on any service, including BRTS,” he added.
