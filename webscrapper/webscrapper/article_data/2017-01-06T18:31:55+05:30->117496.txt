 Davis also reflected on her difficult upbringing, saying, "The only picture I have of myself as a kid in kindergarten is with a little... Expression that's not really a smile, not really a frown, just something. But every time I look at the little girl, I always thought, 'Oh, that's a cute outfit.'
