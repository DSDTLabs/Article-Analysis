CHANDIGARH: An Army sepoy, 25, killed his wife, 23, with a wire and hid her body in a steel trunk at his girlfriend's house in Bhiwani, Haryana, when she found out about his illicit affair.

 The accused, Sukesh Kumar, and his friend Aarti, 35, have been booked in a case of murder at Jhajjar police station.
 
 Kumar, who is from the Jat regiment, had only recently been posted to Jammu & Kashmir and was in Jhajjar on a month's leave. In the face of his wife's opposition of his affair, he decided to get her out of the way and planned her cold-blooded murder. The duo also decided to mislead the police by filing a missing report of the victim. Looking for Kumar's wife, cops stumbled upon her from an iron trunk in a room of Aarti's house in Bhiwani town.
 
 Investigations revealed that Sukesh was married to Pooja two years ago and the couple had a one-year-old son. The family lived in Dhakla village of Jhajjar.
 
 After Sukesh had filed a complaint over his wife going missing on Wednesday , police revisited his house for investigations, but he fled from the rear door.
 
 This aroused the cops' suspicions about Kumar. â€œWhen we came to know about his illicit relations with Aarti, we conducted a raid and found his wife's body in a trunk on Thursday,'' said Inspector Surender Singh, the SHO of Jhajjar Sadar police station.
