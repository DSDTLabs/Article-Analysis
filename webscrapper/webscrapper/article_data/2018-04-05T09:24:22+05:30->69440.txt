 A bench of   and Makarand Karnik was hearing MCA member Nadim Memon’s petition against MCA and its committee members for not implementing the Justice R M Lodha committee recommendations.
 
 The names were among those suggested by MCA counsel Rafiq Dada, as well as BCCI counsel Virag Tulzapurkar and Mihir Desai counsel for Memon. All three accepted the names of the administrators who may be assisted by non-disqualified members of MCA as suggested by Dada.
 
 The administrators for the association, will also decide whether to stick to the date for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM), at present scheduled for April 16.
 
 The EGM is to approve amendments to the association’s memorandum and constitution to bring it in tune with the Justice R M Lodha committee recommendations on cricket administration reforms.
 
 The HC allowed MCA to proceed with making deals related to IPL which Dada said is scheduled to start on Saturday. The IPL season XI starts at Wankhede on April 7 and ends on May 27. The MCA also asked the court to consider issues regarding renewal of lease of Wankhede stadium pending before the state, payments of electricity and water bills, issues like allotment of grounds and suggested that five members not disqualified, including Ashish Shelar, Unmesh Khanvilkar, Navin Shetty, Shahalam Shetty and Ganesh Iyer may be allowed to assist the administrators. 
 
 The HC said “it will depend on whether the administrators want assistance or not.’’ Tulzapurkar said that the administrators ought to have control over allocation and sale of tickets too and must be given a draft of the amendment to MCA constitution to see that it complies with Justice Lodha Panel recommendations.
