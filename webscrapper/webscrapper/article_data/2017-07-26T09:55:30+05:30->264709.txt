BENGALURU: A   who had made   (BBP) her home since November, 2015 when she was brought from a zoological park in Israel, died after falling into a pit. Park authorities said they had observed initial pregnancy in the animal.

 According to park authorities, the incident took place on the midnight of July 24 when the   accidentally fell into a pit dug up to erect a wooden pole inside the Zebra enclosure. Having landed on the back, the animal was not able to recover and died due to pain, they said.
 
 BBP's executive director Santosh Kumar said the zebra was aged about three. "We regret to announce her death. Four zebras, including the one who died, were brought from   in Israel, to increase the number of exotic species at the park. Ramat Gan has the largest wildlife under human care in west Asia," he added.
 
 Santosh said: "Muscular haemorrhage or trauma, colic pain and shock due to the fall caused the death. Visceral samples have been sent to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals in Hebbal for final diagnosis."
