PATNA: Barely an hour after   announced that he had resigned as Bihar CM, RJD chief   mocked him for his claim on “zero tolerance on corruption” and said the JD(U) chief was named as an accused in a murder case lodged with Pandarak police station in Patna district 26 years ago. 

 Lalu added that a Barh court has already taken cognizance against Nitish.
 
 “When Nitish himself faced murder charges, how was he continuing as the CM? Committing atrocities against a person is bigger issue than corruption. Where was his zero tolerance?” Lalu told reporters.
 
 Waving before the media a copy of the court order related to the murder case, Lalu said the case (FIR no. 199/1991) was pending before the Patna high court. He said Nitish has also mentioned it in his affidavit before the Election Commission.
 
 Lalu said Nitish telephoned him and greeted him before going to the   to submit his resignation.
 
 “I tried to convince him not to quit. I told him that people of Bihar have given the mandate to the Grand Alliance for five years,” Lalu said.
 
 He said if Nitish has not made any pact with PM, he should convene a meeting of RJD, JD(U) and   legislators and elect a new leader of the alliance minus Tejashwi and himself to facilitate a new government. “Everything was set with BJP. That is why PM lost no time in congratulating Nitish on his resignation.”
