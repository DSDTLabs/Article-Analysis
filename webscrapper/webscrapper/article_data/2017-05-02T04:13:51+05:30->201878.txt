However, the market was slow throughout the month overall. Moreover, the higher imports were also a reflection of final accounts at the end of the fourth quarter, in March.”
 
 “There were also more wedding muhurats in March than in April, which led to lower sales last month. The need for cashless transactions also contributed to lower sales volumes. Akha Trij was the only day when jewellers in the city saw higher sales,” said Jigar Soni, another city-based jeweller.
