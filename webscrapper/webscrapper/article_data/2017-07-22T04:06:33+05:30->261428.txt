KOLKATA: A 23-year-old employee of an IT firm in   was allegedly molested when she was inside a parked car with her friend on Friday afternoon. One person has been arrested in connection to the case. This incident has once again brought spotlight on moral policing by locals in the   area. 

 Sources said, the woman, a resident of   area was sitting in the car with her friend behind Hometown hyperstore and the car was parked near a tea stall . Some of the locals approached them and knocked on the car window. Once the man rolled down the glass, the locals asked them to move away. One of them was drunk and allegedly passed lewd remarks at the woman.
 
 When the couple refused to drive away, an altercation broke out. The goons tried to pull the duo out of the car by dragging them. While the scuffle was on, it was noticed by a police team. Soon, the team reached the spot and two of the miscreants fled but one failed to escape. Based on the woman's complaint,   Police arrested one person. 
 
 The issue of moral policing by locals in the Rajarhat-New Town area is nothing new and several couples in past have been victims of such situation. 
 
 "The trouble of moral policing is more in areas like action area II and III. Initially, they stopped people from doing indecent activities in public places. Gradually, they started demanding money from them. Since some couples are not local, they pay them and try to leave the spot. But since most cases do not have police complaints, these cases go unnoticed," said a local. 
 
 Cops had earlier arrested a miscreant for being allegedly involved in robbing couples sitting in parks. Police suspect that the man, who was arrested after molesting the couple on Friday, might be a part of the same gang.
