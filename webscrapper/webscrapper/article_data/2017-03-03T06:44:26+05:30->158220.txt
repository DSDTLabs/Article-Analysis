JAIPUR: Despite countless   and numerous   awareness programmes, the drivers in the city continue to use blindingly intense   lights in the night on city roads. 

 According to city police, the use of high beam lights is prohibited in city limits and drivers can switch on high beam mode when they are travelling on highways.
 
 While the traffic law specifies a fine of up to Rs 200 on the offenders, the lack of nigh time checking on important city lanes have allowed the problem to mushroom.
 
 “These lights have blinding effect on other motorists. The rear view mirror is completely lit up with high beam lights of vehicle coming from the behind. Similarly, the high beam lights can also take toll on drivers coming from opposite direction,” the police official said.
 
 Vikram Singh, a city-based motor driving instructor, believes that high beam head lights shins straight into the eyes which increases the risk of accidents.
 
 “Many elderly people in Jaipur don't drive in nights because they are so afraid of high beam lights. The only plausible way to deal with such cases is to keep the focus of your eyes on road and not on lights,” Singh said, adding that reckless drivers in the city have caused many casualties.
 
 The city’s traffic police officials believe that many people are not even aware of the proper use of high beam lights. “The driving becomes particularly very risky where there are no median on roads and the oncoming car blinds you,” the police official said, adding that drivers can easily lose focus and crash into another vehicles.
 
 While the law prohibits the use of high beam lights in city limits as it leads to accidents, the city motorists have no qualms flouting rules.
 
 “Until police take a widespread awareness drive, the problem would not be solved. Many people don't even know the difference between the normal light and high beam mode,” said Arjun Kumawat, a lawyer.
