NEW DELHI: Employee morale at soon-to-be-privatised Air India may be low these days but   winning the presidential polls on Thursday sent joy waves coursing through the airline.

 The President-elect's daughter, Swati, is an air hostess in AI and Kovind's brother-in-law, C Shekhar, retired from the airline as in-flight supervisor. Shekhar was the senior vice-president of AI Cabin Crew Association (AICCA). Airline sources say Swati - who does not use her surname - is an airhostess on AI's wide body Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft, which fly long-haul routes to places like Australia, Europe and US. 
 
 “Swati is one of the finest cabin crew members we have. Despite belonging to a political family, she has never ever thrown her weight around or tried to flaunt her connections,“ said a senior official. “A few days back when Swati applied for privilege leave, she did not give the reason that she is doing so as her father is contesting the presidential polls. In fact, she does not even use her surname. Her official records even has her mother's first name Savita and father's name is mentioned as only RN Kovind,“ said the source.
 
 Swati's down-to-earth nature became clear as very few in the airline knew that the soon-to-be-President's daughter is their colleague. Senior pilots of B-777 and 787 aircraft also -who have flown with Swati several times -came to know this fact only on Thursday. It remains to be seen if Swati will resume her flying duties as she will now have security considerations being the President's daughter.
 
 “She is a very fine cabin crew member and we are all very proud of her,“ said a cabin crew member.
 
 Some AI employees are now planning to put in a request to call on President-elect   and make a last-ditch attempt to prevent privatisation. “Kovindji was a great help for AICCA in settling two settlements when he was a Rajya Sabha member and he is very familiar with AI,“ said the member.
