MUMBAI:   on Thursday arrested Sudeep Srivastava, a   of  , in an alleged   and   case involving Rs 1 crore. 

 Police are looking for two other directors of the firm—Sandeep and his father Shyamkumar Srivastava—and   from Thane  .
 
 Sudeep was produced before a metropolitan magistrate’s court which remanded him to police custody till January 6, said Manoj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (zone I).
 
 Police said they registered the first information report against the Srivastavas and Phatak on directions of the 8th metropolitan magistrate’s court that was hearing a private complaint filed by   Pvt Ltd under CRPC 156 (3). 
 
 According to police, Bluestar Infrahousing and New India Mining Corporation had signed a deal in 2012 wherein the former would pay the mining company Rs 2.5 crore to carry out mining on an 81 acre plot in Sindhudurg in Sawantwadi and retrieve iron ore. Police alleged Phatak was a former director of Bluestar Infrahousing who later joined another mining company. 
 
 “Prem Sarogi of Bluestar Infrahousing paid Rs 1 crore to the Srivastavas as advance but soon realised that they had given the same contract to another mining company in which Phatak was a director, thus cheating Sarogi,” said a police officer. Police claimed New India Mining Corporation neither cancelled the agreement with Bluestar Infrahousing nor informed them about giving the contract to another firm and returned the advance amount.
 
 But Phatak told TOI, “Police have recorded my statement. There was no intention to cheat Bluestar Infrahousing as the Srivastavas’ company had decided to return Sarogi’s money when he lodged the complaint. The matter will be amicably settled soon.”
 
 Police are collecting evidence against the accused and will soon submit the chargesheet as per the court directions, said an officer from Marine Drive police station, on condition of anonymity.
