Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has started widening a small bridge on NIBM Road to clear bottlenecks during peak hours.

 The bridge connects traffic to NIBM annexe road, Salunke Vihar Road, Mohammadwadi, Undri and other fringe areas. The civic body had provisioned Rs 60 lakh for widening the bridge in 2016, following complaints of traffic jams.
 
 Local corporator Nanda Lonkar said, “The NIBM Road, that goes over the bridge, has been concreted and widened, but the size of the bridge has remained the same. Motorists were facing trouble crossing the bridge from both sides. We initiated a proposal and made budgetary provisions for widening the bridge. The work has commenced. The project will be completed as soon as possible.” 
 
 Junior engineer Shramik Shewate said, “The bridge is in good condition, we initiated the project after checking its stability. We have paused construction work as we are expecting the soil test report in two days.”
 
 Banker Jaya Shetty from NIBM Road said, “The pressure on the traffic passing via the bridge has increased with rapid urbanisation and increase in population on NIBM Annexe Road, Mohammadwadi and fringe areas. School students travelling in school buses and other vehicles pass the bridge. The narrow stretch is causing minor accidents. The bridge needs to be widened to resolve issues due to rise in the number of vehicles.”
 
 Mohammadwadi Road resident Sanjay Kadam said, “The NIBM Road till the bridge is straight, but while passing over the bridge one has to take a steep turn . The situation increases accident probability if one is travelling at speed.”
