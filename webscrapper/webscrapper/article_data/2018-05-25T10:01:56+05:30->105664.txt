The   may be swarming with men and women in khaki and commandos in black two days after police firing on anti-Sterlite protesters claimed 13 lives, but   -- one of the worst-affected areas in the agitation where two women were killed in firing -- does not have a single policeman standing guard. 

 Residents of the area have blocked all roads leading to the fishing town as a ‘warning’. The neighbourhood is a few hundred feet from the Tuticorin collector and SP’s camp offices, and is also close to the   beach, one of Tuticorin’s major recreation spots.
 
 The dozen streets in Therespuram have been blocked with logs, burned wood and shrubs. One of the main roads connecting the official residences of the collector and SP has been cordoned off by a huge fibre boat almost 20-foot-long.
 
 When the TOI team visited Therespuram, it was confronted by several residents. A man threatened the TOI lensman with ‘dire consequences’ if he attempted to photograph the area. Almost all the streets were deserted except for some women sitting outside their homes and talking in hushed tones. A few men had gathered in front of the lone shop that was open. They too preferred to stay away from the media. Young men were seen patrolling the area with mobile phones in their hands. They were wary of any stranger coming to the town.
 
 The adjoining Muthu Nagar beach, which gets more than 1,500 visitors during the holiday season every day, was also deserted.
