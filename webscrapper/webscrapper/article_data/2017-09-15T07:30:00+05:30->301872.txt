Chandigarh: The   for the higher education institutions released in New Delhi on Thursday added more beauty to the City Beautiful as a city college (GCG-11) and Panjab University figured in the top seven.

 PU has been given seventh position in the rankings released by HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. “You cannot be a part of the City Beautiful and not be counted amongst the good institutions when it comes to cleanliness. If a city institution does not figure in the national list, then you are not worthy of being a part of Chandigarh. Our colleges have also done well,” said PU vice-chancellor prof Arun Kumar Grover.
 
 However, he said still a lot more needs to be done. “At the moment, we are allocating money to the hostels so that all the toilets and washrooms are upgraded. We are also giving hostels space to create AC reading rooms. However, we have still not succeeded in the segregation of green and blue garbage bins. It will be implemented soon,” added Grover.
 
 The higher educational institutions were ranked on the parameters of student-toilet ratio, kitchen hygiene, availability of running water, modernity of toilets and kitchen equipment, campus green cover, garbage disposal in hostels and academic buildings, disposal techniques, water supply systems, and weightage was also given to whether the institutions have adopted any neighbouring locality or village to spread awareness and activities in Swachhta.
