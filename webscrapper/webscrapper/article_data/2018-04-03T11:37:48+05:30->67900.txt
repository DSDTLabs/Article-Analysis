CHANDIGARH: The increase in the paid   charges did not go down well with the UT residents and traders. The members of the   (CBM), an apex body of the traders of the city, staged a protest in Sector 22 on Monday against the hike in paid parking rates. Later, the protesters marched towards the mayor office of the UT MC, Sector 17, and handed over a memorandum to him on various parking-related issues. They also asked him to   the enhanced paid parking charges.

 The traders gathered in the parking area of Sector 22 market, situated outside hotel Jullundhur at 11am. Carrying the placards, traders were seen criticising the MC’s move to double the charges within a period of just three months.
 
 The representatives of the traders’ body addressed a gathering there and demanded a roll back of the hiked rates. They also said that they should be provided other parking-related facilities including additional parking spaces in the markets and commercial areas of the city.
 
 Besides, other issues, traders said that the hiked rates should be deferred immediately and in the meantime, efforts should be made to organise the parking lots so that they can become really ‘smart’. “We request the MC to allow 10 minutes free entry in the parking lot for pick and drop facility for the benefit of the residents,”, the traders mentioned in the memorandum.
 
 The traders also said that most of the paid parking lots in the city are congested. Therefore, people end up parking their vehicles along the roadside. They said there is a dire need to expand the parking lots in the city. According to the traders, there is a need to start community parking in the markets or built construct a multi-level parking space in the busy markets of the city. The traders also mentioned in the memorandum that free parking lots should not be converted into paid parking lots, as people come to the markets a number of times all through the day to buy essential commodities.
