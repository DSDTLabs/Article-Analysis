NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation will now charge   on mobile   erected in its jurisdiction. Supreme Court recently ruled that property tax could be levied on mobile towers and telecom companies would have to pay the charges to the civic body as these come under the ambit of land and building.

 Assessor and collector of   Randhir Sahay said the civic body is preparing a policy. “After the apex court’s ruling, we can bring this new policy and levy tax on towers. It will increase revenue and will help regulate the towers being run illegally,” he said.
 
 “A survey is being conducted to identify all mobile towers under our jurisdiction. It will give a tax boost of about Rs 17 crore,” added Sahay. There are 3,670 mobile towers under the south corporation’s jurisdiction and 2,537 of them have been erected without approval.
 
 Senior officials claim that the new policy would also help ensure that mobile towers are installed only at the buildings that have structural safety clearance. “Right now, telecom companies directly consult the builder and install the tower,” said a senior official.
 
 The one-time installation charge was hiked from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh by the erstwhile MCD in 2010, which urged telecom companies to move court. The case has been pending since then. Several proposals have been brought after that to regulate the one-time installation charge.
