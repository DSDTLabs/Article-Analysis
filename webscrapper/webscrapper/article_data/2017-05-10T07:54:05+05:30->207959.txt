OTTAYAM: The   (TDB) has come up with a claim it had the right to take up the   duties of the  , which is located on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. At present, temple administration is performed by the Kannaki trusts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 

 TDB president   said that the re-installation of the idol at the temple in 1987 was performed by chief priest Ganapathi who was the then chief priest of Sabarimala temple. This, he claimed, was proof enough to say that the temple came under the ambit of TDB. Gopalakrishnan added that he was not interested in beginning a conflict over this issue, he wanted both state governments to hold discussions and come up with an amicable solution where TDB would be allowed to carry out administration duties.
 
 “The state archaeological department had sanctioned Rs 40 lakhs for the revival of the temple. However, there is restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court for construction activities as the temple comes in Periyar Tiger Reserve area,” he said, adding that TDB will move court to lift this restriction to carry out works without disturbing the ecosystem.
 
 The annual Chitra Pournami festival of the temple will be held on Wednesday. Devotees are allowed to travel to the historic temple located in the deep forests – 7km away from Pazhiyankudi in Theni and 15km away from Thekkady in Idukki – on this day only.
 
 “A proper road should be constructed to the temple and the maintenance of the temple has to be done without disturbing the forest ecosystem. The archaeological department is ready to take up the task and the forest department will have to provide help on the road issue and ensuring amenities for devotees,” he said, adding that the aim was to develop it into an international pilgrimage centre. 
 
 He said that TDB would not disturb the customs and traditions followed at the temple by devotees from Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
