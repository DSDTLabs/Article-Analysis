VADODARA: The city police may have switched to technology for the   to pay the fine, but there are glaring errors in issuing the e-challans by the cops.

 While some have complained that they have been sent the e-challan of the same spot more than once, in some cases the e-challans were issued to citizens even when they had sold their vehicles or their vehicles were stolen couple of years back.
 
 A resident of Baranpura, Parmeshwar Sonawne’s bike was stolen from near his house in October 2015 for which he had registered a police complaint. In June last year, he received the e-challan for the bike which was stolen. “I wrote to commissioner of police and even filed an RTI application to know the status of my bike theft case, but I did not get any response, yet I paid the fine of Rs 100,” he said.
 
  again got an e-challan last week for the same stolen bike. Sonawne’s is not the only one who has become victim of such errors. 
 
 A citizen of Panigate area, on Tuesday, received an e-challan for the bike which he had sold off two months back. The man went to police chowki at Parivar crossroads under the jurisdiction of Panigate police station. 
 
 He told the cops there that the man to whom he had sold the bike had not changed the ownership details at the regional transport office (RTO). But he was driven away by the cops since the e-challans are not issued by them.
 
 Falguni Patel, assistant commissioner of police and nodal officer of the project said, “Earlier we used to update the vehicle ownership details with the RTO every week but now they have centralized their data under the National Informatics Centre (NIC) of central government.”
 
 “We have talked with NIC and once their system gets updated we will be able to update the ownership details every day,” she said, adding, “Citizens will face the problem for few days but once things get streamlined there will not be any errors.”
