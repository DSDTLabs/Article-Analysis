KERI: A Great   chick was reunited with the mother bird by wildlife rescuers in   area of Sattari, after treating it for almost two days for injuries it sustained during a fall from the nest. 

 Wildlife enthusiasts found the injured bird under a ‘ghoting’ (Terminilia bellerica) tree, on which the mother bird had built her nest in a hollow crevice of the trunk. The bird was brought to the   managed by wild life rescuer Amrut Singh. He then referred it to wild lifer Ramesh  , who treated it for almost two days. 
 
 “When the chick regained its health, we decided to reunite it with the mother bird, but it was a daunting task as the nest was situated at a height of almost 45 metres from ground level,” Zarmekar said. Wildlife rescuers sought the help of adventure activist Vijay Gawade, who used a rope to ascend the tree and placed the chick in the crevice. Inside the natural habitat, both parents welcomed the bird. Rescuers Ashish Shah, Pradeep Goundalkar and local youth took part in the reunion.
 
 Zarmekar said the bird being predominantly frugivorous, it had to be fed with berries and wild fruits for two days. “We were elated as our hard work made the reunion possible,’’ he said.
