PUNE: Homeopath Babasaheb Khidrapure used abortion drug prostaglandin to terminate pregnancies at his hospital in Mhaisal in Sangvi district, police confirmed on Tuesday while medical practitioners apprehended the involvement of larger nexus in the case.

 The revelation comes a day after the TOI talked about the possibly of misuse of abortion drugs in the case. 
 
 Superintendent of Sangli police   told TOI, “Khidrapure has confessed of using the drug ‘Misoprost’ to carry out illegal abortions. He told police that he used the drug vaginally on his patients.”
 
 Experts said prostaglandin (brand name is Misoprost) has more potency in inducing abortion when used vaginally, but may lead to complications if administered improperly or by an unqualified person.
 
 “The drug can be used in the first and second trimester of pregnancy. When used vaginally, the drug is more effective. If administered improperly, it may lead to complications like excessive bleeding, uterine rupture and even death,” gynaecologist   said.
