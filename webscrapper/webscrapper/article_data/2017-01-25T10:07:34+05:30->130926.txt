PATNA: At a time when   (RSS) is talking about review of   for SC/ST and OBC, former Bihar deputy CM and senior BJP functionary   has called for a national consensus to increase total reservation from 50% to 60% to ensure benefit to new castes accommodated in list of SC/ST and OBC over the years.

 Addressing a function organised on the occasion of 93rd birth anniversary of former CM Karpoori Thakur here on Tuesday, Modi said over the years many castes have been included in the list of SC/ST and OBC, but the total reservation has remained at 50%. 
 
 “Almost all political party talks of protecting the weaker sections of the society and if they are really worried, there should be consensus and the existing limit of 50% reservation should be increased to 60%. It will serve the interest of weaker sections of the society,” Modi said. 
 
 “Instead of just limiting to words, all political parties should deliberate on this important issue and give their dues to the people, who are not getting the benefits due to inclusion of new castes and sub-castes in the list and also due to increasing population,” he added. 
 
 On the reservation offered to weaker sections in panchayats in Bihar, he said there is only 37% reservation. “There is still scope to increase reservation in panchayats by 13%. I request the state government to increase reservation and pass on the benefit to the people from extremely backward castes,” Modi said, adding, “If the present government does not pass on the benefit, it will be done by the BJP whenever it comes to power in the state.”
