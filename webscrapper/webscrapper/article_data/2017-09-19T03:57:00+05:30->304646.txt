Nagpur: The decision on registering a new charitable society by the name ‘Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)’ is likely to be taken on September 22 by the deputy registrar of societies in the office of charity commissioner. Ex-corporator Janardhan Moon had applied to the office for permission to float his own ‘RSS’ claiming that officially no such registered organization was in existence. Subsequently, two separate applications were received raising objections.  Rajendra Gundalwar submitted an objection in which he claimed that RSS was already registered as a national-level religious body in Delhi.  The second objection was filed jointly by two individuals — Deepak Barad and Prashant Bopardikar through their counsel S D Abhyankar. This application mainly pointed to Section 3A of Registration of Societies Act, 1860, which specifically bars use of word ‘National’ (Rashtriya) in the name of any society. The third hearing in the matter was scheduled on Monday, during which deputy registrar Karuna Patre heard arguments of the disputing parties involved. Barad and Bopardikar sought documents like minutes of the meeting of Moon’s RSS meetings, how it was formed and who proposed and seconded the name RSS and the intentions behind it. Meanwhile, Gundalkar, against whom Moon has registered a police case, has sought action by the charity commissioner office against Moon and his proposed organization since they were misleading the society. He has also threatened to file a defamation case against Moon who in his police complaint had named Gundalwar as being associated with those who could have conspired to kill social activists like Gauri Lankesh, Narendra Dabholkar and Kalburgi and Com. Pansare.
