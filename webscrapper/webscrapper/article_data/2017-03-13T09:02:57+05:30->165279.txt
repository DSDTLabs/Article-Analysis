PANAJI: From a fringe political party that espoused the cause of the common coconut, to becoming kingmakers,   has come a long way.

 Probably for the first time since Goa got its statehood, the recently-formed regional party has come to play an important role in Goa’s political landscape.
 
 The Vijai Sardesai-led party will now feature prominently in the next BJP-led government with all three MLAs expected to be given cabinet minister posts.   contested four seats and did surprisingly well with just one candidate, Anthony Rodrigues, losing out in Velim against Congress. 
 
 Siolim MLA-elect Vinod Palyekar, Vijai Sardesai ( ) and Jayesh Salgaonkar ( ) will now have the benefit of being part of the ruling dispensation, thanks to the BJP’s desperate need for numbers.
 
 Interestingly, Goa Forward, especially Sardesai, was a vocal critic, both in the assembly and outside, of the BJP’s policies.
 
 The impetus for the formation of the party, and the party’s symbol, was the protection of the coconut tree. 
 
 The party shot to the forefront when it protested against the Laxmikant Parsekar government’s decision to amend rules to simplify the process to cut a coconut tree.
 
 With apparent premonition of things to come, Sardesai who is also known for his political acumen, was guarded in making statements on who GFP would support in government formation. While he was always a bitter critic of  , his tone and tenor was different two days before counting, saying that anyone who fulfils GFP’s promise of ‘Goenkarponn’ would receive their support. 
 
 Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, while coming out of the counting hall on Saturday, let the cat out of the bag by saying he has had three rounds of meetings with Sardesai, referring to pre-counting talks.
