NEW DELHI: After   was the only silver lining on the opening day of the  ,   Kumar and   brought home two more medals on Thursday. They both bagged bronze medals in their respective categories to keep the interest level alive in the competition. In a closely fought contest, Anil beat   of   7-6 in the men's Greco-Roman 85kg category while Jyoti finished on the podium in women's 75kg event.

 Earlier, India looked on track when the clash between Anil and Shamsiddinov started off well. Anil was clearly the stronger of the two although Uzbek was technically the better wrestler. Eventually, the Indian looked to be on the attack for most of the contest and caused problems for the Uzbek with his height advantage and superior strength.
 
 Shamsiddinov however, fought well on the counter thanks to his better technique and almost pulled off a win over his stronger opponent. The Uzbek in fact, came closing to pinning Anil on several occasions but the India used his raw power to wriggle out of danger every time.
 
 Anil took a 1-0 lead in the opening round when a passivity point was awarded against the Uzbek. But the Uzbek made a strong comeback with a takedown to take the lead at 2-1. He then held on to the lead and went into the break with a one point advantage.
