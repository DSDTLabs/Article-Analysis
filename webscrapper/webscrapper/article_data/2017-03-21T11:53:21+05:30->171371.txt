KOCHI: The   has asked   to inform its stance about taking over the probe into the death of actor  .

 The court issued the directive after CBI's counsel submitted that no special instructions have been received from the central government regarding the demand for taking over the investigation. A petition filed by Mani's brother  , seeking a directive to hand over the investigation to CBI, is being considered by the court. Approaching the court on the first anniversary of his brother's death, Ramakrishnan had alleged that police have not been able to bring the culprits before law despite probing the case for a year. As per his petition, certain associates of the actor, who are very scheming, cautiously administered methyl alcohol to him on March 5 last year knowing that he is suffering from chronic liver cirrhosis so as to cause his death.
 
 However, police had ruled out murder in a report filed to the high court in response to the petition.
