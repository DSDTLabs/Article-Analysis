Guntur: District collector Kona Sasidhar conducted   (grievance day) in   on Monday. This was the first time the programme was organised outside the district headquarter. Taking into account many travel to the district headquarters with much difficulty to file their grievances, the collector decided on the move. All senior officials and departmental heads participated in the   Day session.

 While, Bapatla witnessed its first Grievance Day session, the occasion was held in Guntur as usual. The second senior most officer of respective departments participated the Grievance Day in Guntur.
 
 “We will conduct Meekosam in constituency headquarters so that it helps locals reach senior officials easily who can solve their grievances,” said the collector. He further revealed that plans are afoot to conduct at least two Meekosam sessions in a month outside Guntur city.
 
 He said, while the presence of district officials would facilitate resolution of long-standing grievances on the spot, small grievances can resolved without delay. He directed tehsildars and departmental officers to ensure that people do not have to sweat it out to get their problems redressed. “Take positive decisions whenever it is possible. Why should commoners have to revisit district headquarters seeking intervention of officers when the issue can be settled by field officer,” he asked.
 
 Sasidhar, however clarified, district officers would intervene only in complicated issues, and not in minor grievances.
