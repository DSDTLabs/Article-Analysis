GANDHINAGAR:The Centre has proposed a Rs 10,000 crore project to develop a 590km long inland waterway connecting Gujarat and Rajasthan through the Jawai River, Luni River and Kori Creek in the Rann of Kutch. 

 
 “This project will create an alternative transport route to the railways. Industrial corridors are also coming up in these areas, so we have decided to do detailed assessment of feasibility, environmental concern, return on investment etc,” said Arjun Ram Meghwal, Union minister of state, water resources, after having a meeting with Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani on Wednesday.
 
 Meghwal said, “On May 23, Union water resources minister   gave in-principle approval to developing 111 inland waterways in the country with inland waterway No. 48 meant to connect Kori Creek area on the Arabian Sea in Kutch to Rajasthan.” The minister said that the estimated project cost is Rs 10,000 crore. “We are also studying this project with a South Korean company,” he added.
 
 He said that  , the central PSU previously known as Water and   (India) Limited, has already prepared a pre-feasibility report and a detailed project report is being made. The project will include water desalination.
 
 “The consent of both states is required, and I met CM Vijay Rupani and the Gujarat chief secretary for this,” Meghwal said. “We discussed the issue of the proximity of the waterway to the Pakistan border, the new notification from the ministry of home affairs, several environmental issues, and the importance of the national waterways.”
 
 Meghwal said there will soon be a second meeting with the chief minister and other state functionaries about the project.
