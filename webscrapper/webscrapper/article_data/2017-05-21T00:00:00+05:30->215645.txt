...like serious grown-ups who remember to get bread, pay the maid on time and do laundry! Daily! Time to get your life together... or at least pretend to be sorted.

 
 You will be reminded about your 30 and beyond status every given opportunity, and you won’t be given time to take it all in. You have a lot of forms to fill – banks, investments, rent, tax!
 
 
 
 Remember when you told yourself that it’ll get better when you are all grown up? Well, you are all grown up, and nothing is better and this, right here, is life. Deal with it.
 
 
 
 By the time you are 30, you are an important person in the office. Dress the part. You cannot go to the team party and pretend to have no money for drinks. Sometimes, you will also have to *gasp* pay for the other 21-year-old in your workplace, because ADULT!
 
 
 You can no longer escape the shame that comes after 25 missed calls last night to the ex with a silly “I was drunk”. Hello, responsibility!
 
 
 
 You can be secretly clueless; but you are supposed to have gained wisdom in the three decades. It’s time to pass it on to the next 18-year-old. Accept it. Your 20s are OVER! Period.
