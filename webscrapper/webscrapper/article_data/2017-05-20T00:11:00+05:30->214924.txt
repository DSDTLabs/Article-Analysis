 The SC, while disposing off her petition on Thursday, had granted her liberty to approach a committee of two judges to be nominated by the chief justice for redressal of grievances.
 
 In her letter to the protonotary and senior master, Bombay HC, Verma has sought urgent directions from the chief justice for nominating the committee. “The petitioner’s grievance involves proposed tree-cutting for Mumbai Metro Line III. The SC has directed the petitioner to approach the committee for redressal of the grievances. As the Metro III is a project of significant public importance, the petitioner would not like to cause any delays in approaching the committee, hence there is an urgency in the matter,” reads the letter.
 
 The letter also requests the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd to hold its hands till the committee, as envisaged in the May 18 SC order, is formed and given a chance to hear the petitioner’s grievances.
 
 “Any attempt to cut any trees before the committee has had an opportunity to redress the petitioner’s grievance would be an attempt to frustrate the SC orders. You are requested to honour the SC’s order in letter and in spirit,” states the letter.
 
 An MMRCL spokesperson said, “The SC on May 18 upheld the Bombay HC order on vacating the stay of cutting of trees dated May 5, 2017. Accordingly, MMRC will proceed with all activities that are essential for implementation of Metro III and be compliant with the court’s decisions.”
