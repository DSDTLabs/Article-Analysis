BHOPAL: Two policemen of Chhattisgarh have landed in a soup following a selfie with  , the psychopath accused of killing his girlfriend and parents.

 The picture went viral on Sunday while attracting strong reactions from social media users, with many of them asking police if Udyan was a ‘celebrity’ for the department, said sources. The accused too is smiling and posing for the selfie clicked inside a police vehicle.
 
 Senior police officers, however, are on the defensive. “No, it was not a selfie at all, just a picture,” said additional SP of Raipur Vijay Agrawal who is investigating the double murder of Udyan’s parents. While the police official has refused any inquiry into the issue, sources in the department said that senior officials have termed the picture “very concerning”. 
 
 “The two cops will face disciplinary action if it is found that they have violated any rule or regulation,” said an officer but not willing to be named.
 
 Udyan was brought to Raipur on Sunday on a transit remand regarding the double murder of his parents. After the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Arun Kumar Nandi remanded him in 10 days’ police custody while granting the plea of Raipur police that his presence was necessary as he is accused in the case, the two policemen took the selfie while taking him to the police station.
 
 However, the arrogant and suave Udyan whom police and media had seen for the past many days, has changed. He had told cops of Bankura Sadar police station that he “knows the gallows are waiting for him”. He even enquired about the possible time frame for his conviction.
 
 Udyan said he wanted to set up a trust in the name of his girlfriend Akansha. He said the little fortune that he still has — the house in Bhopal, some gold ornaments of his mother and his father’s fixed deposit — could be used to create a corpus for this trust,” said a senior police officer.
