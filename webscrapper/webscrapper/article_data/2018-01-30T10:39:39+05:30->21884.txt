THRISSUR: The tenth edition of   of   (ITFoK) concluded here on Monday with a call for serious introspection to consolidate the gains and eliminate organizational pitfalls.

 Participants and viewers of the ten-day-long festival, which showcased 33 performances from India and abroad, urged that introspection was required in the selection process of plays as well as on the impact of the event on the theatre landscape of the country, particularly in Kerala.
 
 Agriculture minister  , who had inaugurated the festival on January 21, also mooted an objective analysis of strength and weakness of the event while delivering the concluding address.
 
 Writer  , who was the secretary of   when it launched ITFoK in 2008, said it was important to begin play selection process earlier. He noted that selection of plays after watching videos would be far from satisfactory. "We cannot judge a play by watching the videos, instead one or two competent curators should travel abroad to watch live performances, even if it would be expensive,'' he said.
 
 There were also demands for giving due importance to the plays from Kerala, and to take steps for giving proper exposure to local productions in international theatre circuits. Another suggestion was to include best plays from state amateur theatre competitions at ITFoK. Some of the activists felt that there should be certain number of free tickets so that the festival would become more accessible to all.
 
 Most of the theatre groups who had presented the plays at ITFoK, particularly those from other states and abroad, were excited about the audience response. They said that the large turnout and viewers discerning responses augur well for the future of the festival.
