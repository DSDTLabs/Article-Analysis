GURGAON: Under the   initiative of the government, those who flout traffic rules will get printed   slips. Sources said that traffic cops would be given swiping machines, through which they would generate a printed challan on the spot, thereby making a real-time entry into the system. 

 At present, manually marked challans are issued by cops, And violators can only pay fines after at least a day. 
 
 The orders for the devices were placed on December 19, 2017, and the delivery has begun in batches. So far, 26 zonal traffic officers in Gurgaon have been issued e-challaning machines, while the remaining 74 will be issued by mid-January, sources said.
 
 Following training, cops will be able to open the challan booklet on the swipe machine’s touch screen, they will mark the offences on the page, and will give its printout to the violators. By January 20, all traffic inspectors on road will get an e-challaning device.
 
 The benefit of new process is that the challan will be simultaneously uploaded on the   server. As a result, commuters will be able to pay their fines on the spot, or at the challan branch the same day. Earlier, they had to make multiple trips to the challan branches to pay the fine because the entry was made manually into the data server. The entries took at least a day, and sometimes longer, depending on the backlog, to make the entries which wasted the commuters’ time. Notably, around 7.5 lakh challans were issued in Gurgaon in 2017. 
 
 “We will have all   cops on road duties to issue e-challans only. The machines will start coming in by mid of January, and traffic inspectors will start using the same by the January 20,” said Deepak Gahlawat, DCP (traffic), Gurgaon.
