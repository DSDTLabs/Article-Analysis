PATNA:   president   on Tuesday relieved   from the post of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief with immediate effect.

 With Choudhary’s removal all existing committees of the BPCC stand dissolved. BPCC vice-president Qaukab Kadri has been made working president till a full-fledged state president is appointed, sources in the Congress said. Kadri is close to former union minister Akhilesh Prasad Singh who recently emerged as one of the front runners for the post of state Congress chief. 
 
 Choudhary’s removal came days after he accused “a few AICC leaders” of fuelling rebellion against him with false propaganda that he was making attempts to split the Congress legislature party in Bihar. Congress has 27 MLAs in 243-member Bihar assembly. It was widely believed in the Congress circles that a majority of the party MLAs had formed an informal group and were trying to cross over to the ruling JD(U).
 
 Qadri thanked the party’s central leadership for giving him responsibility of the state Congress. AICC general secretary and party in charge for Bihar affairs CP Joshi on Tuesday said, “There must be some reason behind removal of Choudhary.” Joshi also said the ongoing organisational polls in state Congress would be competed as per the schedule released by the AICC.
 
 As per election schedule, elections of district Congress Committee and delegates for AICC and BPCC have to be completed by October 16.
 
 Choudhary, who is considered close to Congress vice-president  , was appointed BPCC chief on March 31, 2013, almost two-and-a-half years after his predecessor Mehboob Ali Qaiser resigned from the post following the drubbing in the 2010 assembly elections.
