GURGAON: A 30-year-old man, who   a   at a busy   on March 27 evening, was arrested at   in Delhi on Monday. 

 Pawan Kumar alias Matru told police he was in a relationship with Gunjan (18), and killed her after he came to know of her suspected affair with someone else.
 
 During interrogation, Pawan, a resident of Kot village in Jhajjar district of Haryana, also said he never stalked her, and flashed Gunjan’s name tattooed on his chest.“I am not a jilted lover, stalker or eve-teaser. I was in a serious relationship with her for the past four years. I sold my land and home to fulfil her wishes, and had even approached her family with a marriage proposal. Though her father had given his consent, her mother was against it. Still, we continued being together,” he said in his statement to the police. 
 
 “Then, I got to know that she had started seeing somebody else at her workplace. Lately, she started ignoring me. It was then that I decided “if not mine, she will not be of anybody else”. I bought a gun from Aligarh for Rs 12,000 last month, and shot her with it,” he added.
 
 On March 27, Gunjan, who was originally from Uttar Pradesh but lived with her parents in Gurgaon’s Shankar Vihar colony, was shot dead soon after she walked out the Patanjali store in Sector 21. Gunjan, who had been pursuing graduation from Delhi University’s School of Open Learning, used to work as a part-time sales executive at the Patanjali store.
 
 Her father Chandram Dutt had lodged a murder complaint against Pawan and alleged he used to stalker his daughter.
 
 “Palam Vihar crime unit in-charge, inspector  , picked him up in Bharthal village (Delhi) this afternoon. He said he wanted to marry her. When she refused, he decided to kill her. We are questioning him to find out if anybody else was also involved,” said Sumit Kuhar, DCP (crime), Gurgaon. 
 
 Pawan will be produced in a city court on Tuesday.
