UJJAIN: Ujjain district   has directed Indian railways to pay Rs 1.41 lakh to a passenger for failing to ensure safety from a thief, who made away with a bag containing ornaments and other valuables, during journey.

  The forum chairman Gajendra Singh and member Purshottam Tiwari asked the divisional railway manager of western railways to pay Rs 1.41 lakh to   Arvind Singh Chandel in next two months. In case of delay, the railways will have to pay interest of 7 per cent on the amount from August 25, 2013.
 
 Chandel had claimed in the petition that he was travelling in   (train no. 19019) on February 16, 2013, when a thief entered the S1 compartment and made away with a bag kept under the pillow by his wife Rekha Chandel.
 
 Chandel was on way to attend a marriage. The bag contained ornaments worth Rs 1.27 lakh, a mobile phone worth Rs 1,450 and cash to the tune of Rs 10,000. 
 
 The victim gave a chase to catch the accused, but the thief jumped out of the moving train and escaped. He had later lodged a complaint with the railway police at Nizamuddin railway station.
 
 Petitioner’s counsel Pratap Singh Rawat contended that the railways had failed to provide security to the travellers in the compartment. The emergency chain pulling mechanism did not work in the coach and railway staff was not present to intervene in the matter. He alleged that there was lapse of service on part of railways.
 
 The western railways claimed that it had no control over the government railway police (GRP) and under Section 100 of The Railways Act, the railways was only responsible for the booked luggage.
 
 The consumer forum rejected the railway’s contention and passed the verdict in favour of the petitioner. The court also asked the railways to pay Rs 2000 to the petitioner to cover legal costs.
