CHENNAI: The director general of police on Wednesday informed the Madras high court that instructions have already been issued to all the superintendents and commissioners of police across the state to take appropriate action on the representation of mobile operator   seeking protection to its offices.

 Justice M S   said, “In view of the submission made by the DGP, no other specific direction is warranted at this stage. The DGP shall take cognizance of the situation and take necessary precaution to avoid any untoward incidents,” and posted to the plea to March 21 for reporting compliance.
 
 Claiming that despite repeated complaints, police protection was not provided to its offices, Aircel insisted on a direction to provide such protection in view the hearing of its insolvency petition before the companies tribunal scheduled on Thursday.
 
 “As information about the company’s financial difficulties and possible insolvency became public, vendors, creditors and customers took the law in their hands and, over the past 20 days, have been vandalising the office premises and showrooms of the company, threatening the lives of several of its employees and key management people,” the petitioner said.
 
 Submitting that police protection was particularly required in six of its premises in Chennai, Coimbatore, Trichy, Madurai and   as these premises contain the main switching centres which operate and connects the signal towers of the company throughout the state, the petitioner said, “If these centres were damaged, the whole telecommunication system of the petitioner would be damaged and the petitioner and members of the public would be put to serious hardship since there would be no cellular connectivity to any of the customers across the state.”
