Ludhiana: Continuing his winning streak, 13-year-old  , a city-based shuttler, has made the city proud by winning the bronze medal in the 63rd National School Games. The game was recently held in Proddatur, Andhra Pradesh in the last week of January.

 Jain, a student of Class VIII in the Sat Pal Mittal school, represented Punjab and defeated P V Sanjeevi of Telengana in two matches by 21-12, 21-19 in the under-14 single individual event.
 
 Besides this, last year Jain bagged the silver medal in the Glasgow International Youth Badminton championship 2017, which was concluded in Scotland. He participated in the under-13 single category.
 
 Jain said this time it wasn’t an easy task as more than 25 state players had competed in the national-level game. “I continued to work hard and therefore have managed to clinch the bronze medal,” he said.
 
 He further said, “I did commit some marginal errors and therefore, I could not grab the silver medal. However, my coach said I should always learn from my mistakes. Next time, I will ensure gold in the national-level school games.”
 
 The badminton player said he wakes up at 5am every day for his training sessions. “I aim is to participate in the Olympics and bag a medal for my country,” he said.
 
 Jain’s coach, Mangat Rai Sharma, said, “Arnam has performed exceptionally well in the national games. It’s difficult to secure a medal in the individual event at such an early age but Arnam gas done this quite well. His win will motivate other players to do the same,” he said.
