THANE: With barely a week left for the   elections, the election department has released the final list of around 12 lakh   as per the polling booths on Tuesday. 

 The final voter’s list is ideally readied weeks before the elections following which political parties refer to the same to understand the profile of their respective voter base. Also, the slips generated are sent to the residents who also get an idea of the polling station where they are supposed to caste their votes. Officials blamed the delay to a deferred decision by the election commission about inclusion of photos of the voters in the list and renumbering of voters in the lists. 
 
 The delay has caused immense inconvenience to voters who say they are still unaware about the status of their polling booth and where to vote. “I am still ignorant of where to go and cast my vote as the neither the political party nor the administration has issued the slip yet. The smart initiatives of the administration seems to have failed completely,” complained a civic activist.
 
 The problem was due to renumbering of the list for each of the 1,704 booths in the city that have been assigned maximum of 800 voters this time. The EC had mandated that the numbering of voters for all the list should be done between 1 and 800 for each of the booths as against the regular process of continuing with the numbering for other booths. So for example, if booth one has voters 1 to 800 marked, the subsequent voters in the booth 2 would be again numbered between 1 and 800 instead of continuing from 801 and so on. 
 
 Further, the department had also initially asked corporations to not use photos in the voter list. The   election department finally went ahead with releasing the list with voters and their photos as there was no decision received from the EC, said a senior official.
