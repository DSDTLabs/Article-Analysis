Surat: The anti-cattle squad of   (SMC) had to face the ire of residents at   in   when about eight stray cattle caught from the area were locked up in the parking of one of the houses. 

 Sources said the incident took place on Tuesday morning when the anti-cattle squad members locked up the stray cattle caught from the society in the parking slot of a private house. 
 
 The residents took the squad members to task for not seeking permission to keep the cattle in the parking and demanded that the animals be removed. 
 
 Praveen  , a resident of Shreeji Society, said, “The staff officer of the squad gave lame excuses that since they do not have proper place to keep the stray cattle, they thought of locking them up in the parking and that the animals could be transported to panjrapole later. The cattle were there for more than four hours and the parking space had turned into a real mess.” 
 
 It was only after protest by the residents that the squad members brought a vehicle to transport the stray cattle from the parking and a fire tender was called in to clean up the space. 
 
 Baldaniya added, “The same herd of stray cattle was caught earlier by the squad members. They impound the cattle and release them on the main road when the owners pay bribe. This is going on for past many years.” 
 
 The squad officer said, “We had no space to keep the stray cattle. So, we thought of locking them up in the parking until our vehicle arrived.”
