Young tiger Jr NTR’s new movie under the direction of   Srinivas has been creating a lot of buzz in   ever since it went on floors. Titled ‘Aravinda Sametha’ the film is touted to be an action entertainer. The makers released the title and first look of the film on the eve of Tarak’s birthday. In the poster NTR is seen showing off his six-pack abs, giving aggressive looks with a knife in hand and blood on his trouser. 

  Later as another birthday treat for Jr NTR's fans the makers unveiled a motion poster of the flick today morning on May 20, on the occasion of Tarak’s birthday. Producer S   released the motion poster on social media and wrote, “Here's a special birthday treat for our Young Tiger #NTR @tarak9999 .. #AravindhaSamethaMotionPoster .. A Trivikram Celluloid. Enjoy! #AravindhaSamethaFirstLook @MusicThaman @hegdepooja #HappyBirthdayNTR (sic)” The motion poster gives us a glimpse of the actor and actress  . The most striking portion of the motion poster is Thaman’s breezy and instantly impressive background score. Seems like Thaman has determined to give a hit album, though he is teaming up with Trivikram for the first time.
