PUNE: A man raped an 80-year-old   after finding her alone at her shanty in the   area on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.

 The woman was sleeping in the hut when the suspect, believed to be a burglar, entered it through the gap in the tin roof. “When the suspect could not find anything valuable to decamp with, he raped the woman,” an officer from the   police said, adding that the woman suffers from poor eyesight.
 
 The woman’s son, who works in a private company, was away at work at the time of the incident. “When her son returned to the hut on Saturday morning, the woman narrated the entire incident to him,” police said.
 
 The woman lodged a complaint with the Dehu Road police on Saturday evening. “Soon after receiving the complaint, the woman was sent for a medical examination, which revealed that she was tortured and raped,” an officer from the Dehu Road police said.
 
 Further investigation is on, police said.
