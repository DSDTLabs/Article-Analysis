BENGALURU: It is hard to imagine what the city would look like without flex banners, and citizens of   and   zones have urged the   to end this eyesore. At  's Bengaluru Forward event on Saturday, citizens told officials: "Do not let ugly banners spoil the city's beauty."

 The message was especially reinforced, given the approaching assembly polls. "The city is dotted with banners and hoardings with the images of ministers and politicians," said  , a resident of   in RR Nagar, adding: "This violates BBMP's rules which ban flex banners. Why can't the   implement its own rules?"
 
 The Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1981, states it is illegal to install flex banners without the BBMP's permission. The BBMP has to collect a security deposit of Rs 1,000 and advertisement tax before permitting flex banners. If the banners are not removed in 24 hours, then the deposit is forfeited and the BBMP removes the flexes.
 
 Officials urged residents to call the BBMP's control room with the location of the illegal banners, and said they would remove them immediately. 'Bengaluru Forward', a campaign organized by TOI, brings citizens and key government stakeholders together to find solutions to civic challenges. KPMG is the knowledge partner for the campaign.
