LUCKNOW: Irrespective of what would be their fate in the forthcoming assembly polls, BSP workers are in party mood, preparing to cut cake at a number of places on the occasion of their president   on Sunday. But this time, they have decided not to give a call for donation in the wake of demonetisation and also to scale down the pomp and show associated with the celebration.The party has been taking donation on Mayawati’s birthday in a tradition started by party founder Kanshiram of celebrating it as ‘Arthik Sahyog Diwas’ (financial support day)with the slogan ‘Ek vote, ek note’ (One vote, one currency note). 

 Model code of conduct in the poll bound state, is another factor that will tone down the celebrations and party workers have decided only to cut the birthday cake in all 403   as Mayawati turns 61. “Celebrations will be the party’s internal affair but we cannot stop supporters from attending the function,” said a  .
 
 “The party has opposed demonetisation strongly and it will drive home the message better by not accepting donation from supporters,’’ said a political expert.
 
 A senior BSP functionary said the party workers have also been directed not to celebrate the day as ‘Jankalyankari Diwas’ (people welfare day) and distribute sweets, fruits and quilt to the poor. “There is a strict direction from the party top brass not to violate model code of conduct,” said a party leader.
 
 Sources, however, said the party might attempt a show of strength by organising functions in all assembly constituencies. In fact, sources said, many events were put on hold to ensure the birthday celebrations are visible to the electorate.
 
 The BSP boss, known for her fondness for wearing diamond ear-rings and a pink suit on her birthday is also expected to release the 12th volume of her blue book titled, ‘A travelogue of my struggle-ridden life and BSP movement’.
