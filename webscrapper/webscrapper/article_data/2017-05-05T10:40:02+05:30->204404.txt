VADODARA: As many as 53 persons were cheated by two fraudsters who promised them jobs of clerks and peons in   (BoB) and took nearly Rs 32 lakh from them. The accused Lalji Patel and Ranjitsinh   were arrested and sent to police custody for a day.

 The cheating came to light after one of the victims Purushottam   lodged complaint with Makarpura police station. Vankar told the police that a year ago he had met Patel at a religious function and the latter told him that his friend   could help get jobs in BoB. Vankar was looking for jobs for his two sons.
 
 Vankar then met Rathod who told him that he would have to pay Rs 1.20 lakh (Rs 60,000 each for two sons) for the jobs. In March, Vankar gave them the entire amount. Rathod said that he would have to give this money to some senior officials of the bank. Rathod also told Vankar that if any of his relatives or friends want jobs, they could contact him. 
 
 On Wednesday, Patel and Rathod called up Vankar and asked his sons to come for interview at a community hall in Navapura. When Vankar and his sons reached the place, they saw many other persons who had given money to the duo were already present there. However, Patel and Rathod were not there and did not turn up for a long time. Later, Vankar and others contacted the Sayajigunj branch of Bank of Baroda and informed about the payment of cash to the duo for jobs. 
 
 The bank officials told them that they have not authorized anyone for such recruitment nor do they take money from anyone for jobs.
 
 Vankar then contacted Patel and Rathod for receipts for the cash that he gave them. However, when they refused, Vankar got to know that he was cheated and approached Makarpura police station. A police official said that in all, the accused have taken Rs 31.95 lakh from all the job aspirants. Lalji Patel runs an ayurvedic medicines store in the city.
