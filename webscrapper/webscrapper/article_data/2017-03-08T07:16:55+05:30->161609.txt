PUNE: The   claimed to have busted a fake imported   in the city recently with the arrest of two persons and seizure of 72 bottles of spurious liquor worth over Rs3.68 lakh.

 The arrested duo sold the   as well-known imported brands. Their clients were over 300 college students and IT professionals in the city. They used to purchase the spurious scotch for parties and other get-togethers through online portals and word-of mouth.
 
 Mohan Varde, the superintendent of state excise department (Pune), told TOI on Tuesday, “The fake scotch was bottled in one-litre ‘imported-look-alike’ bottles, authentic versions of which are sold only abroad. But the accused managed to get bogus bottles, fake seal caps and labels as well as fake carry bags of duty free shops from suppliers in Mumbai and China. These fake scotch bottles resembled the authentic bottles sold in duty free shops of the biggest brands in the world.”
 
 Preliminary investigations revealed the customers of the arrested duo bought the fake scotch assuming they were getting a good deal at a cheaper price.
 
 Varde said, “Investigations indicated that youth studying in colleges in various parts of the city, including Deccan, Sinhagad Road, Vimannagar and Khadki, as well as IT professionals had been buying the fake scotch for birthday and campus selection parties because of cheap rates. The culprits said during interrogation that buying branded scotch for parties was a status symbol among youth.”
 
 He said the young customers of the culprits were exposing themselves to the dangers of consumption of spurious liquor. “Methyl alcohol used in spurious liquor is very dangerous for health. Its health impacts include permanent physical damage, damage to the central nervous system, kidney failure, blindness and even death,” he said.
 
 “The investigation into the case assumes significance considering several people died recently in Ahmednagar consuming spurious liquor,” said Varde.
