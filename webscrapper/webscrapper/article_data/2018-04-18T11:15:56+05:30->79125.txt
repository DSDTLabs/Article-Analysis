RAIPUR: Congress led by   poses no challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said chief minister Raman Singh, adding that the party will find it difficult to win even 40 or 50 seats in the 2019 parliamentary polls. Modi has his 'magic' and the people of the country stand by him, Singh said, stressing that the   would do even better in the next general elections than it did in 2014 because of the   government's policies. 

 Congress ccupies fourth position in  , and is behind three or four parties in Bihar and is not a frontrunner in West Bengal, Singh said. "It will hardly hardly manage to get 40-50 MPs in the Lok Sabha polls," he said. Asked to comment on the BJP's defeat in the Phulpur and   by-elections last month, Singh said "immediate reactions" often had an impact on by-polls and they might go against a ruling dispensation.
 
 But civic and Assembly polls were fought on different issues and could not be compared with general elections, he said. On Chhattisgarh's assembly elections, slated to be held later this year, the chief minister said the BJP's direct competition was with the Congress. Referring to Ajit  's Chhattisgarh Janata Congress, Singh said whether the former chief minister fought from the Congress or separately, the BJP would benefit.
 
 "Jogi will exist (in state politics) but whether the former chief minister and his party separately fight the election or with the Congress, the BJP will benefit," he said.
