MANGALURU: The BJP has condemned utterances of participants at the   human chain formation across the state on January 30 that targeted Prime Minister   and RSS leaders, in an event the organizers touted as an "apolitical" event. The party also described as unfortunate the move to drag Gandhian H S Doreswamy into this act of criticizing the Prime Minister and saffron organizations at an event organized to commemorate the birthday of slain journalist  . 

 State BJP spokesperson Sulochana G K Bhat told reporters on Thursday that media advisor to chief minister Siddaramaiah, Dinesh Amin Mattu, had used the event to indulge in bashing of political opponents, and that the party condemned it. "The language used by Mattu at an event held to promote communal amity does not augur well for the idea of amity," she said. She also criticized the language used by Mattu against senior Congress leader   and RSS leader K  .
 
 "Using a 'secular' comme nt for narrow casteist and political gains is unfortunate," Sulochana said. She said discerning voters will see through the political game behind the human chain formation. "Dinesh Amin Mattu is not the custodian of Sri Kshetra Kudroli or events that transpire there," she said, referring to Mattu's criticism of the presence of Prabhakar Bhat, at the launch of Poojary's autobiography.
