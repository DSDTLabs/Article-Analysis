PANAJI: Goa Tourism Development Corporation ( ) chairman   on Friday said that he has informed chief minister   that the corporation is willing to develop a mobile application for launching its own taxi services in the state. He also said that only taxis registered prior to December 31, 2017 will be integrated into this service.

 Speaking to mediapersons after the   legislative wing meeting at the assembly complex, Cabral said that he was never against taxi operators. He also said that he will take up the challenge to resolve the taxi operators’ problems. 
 
 “All taxis registered prior to December 31, 2017 will be included in this app,” the GTDC chairman said, adding that he is opposed to the entry of private app-based taxi services in the state.
 
 Cabral said that if taxi operators percieve a threat from cab aggregator app services, then GTDC will launch its own mobile app. “I assure the taxi operators that they will earn Rs 700 per day, that is a minimum of Rs 21,000 per month, throughout the year, on the condition that they have to work under GTDC,” he added. 
 
 Last year, the GTDC chairman had declared his intent of launching a taxi service following an online petition that urged the chief minister to introduce app-based taxi services.
