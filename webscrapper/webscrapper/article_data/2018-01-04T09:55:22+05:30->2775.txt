PANAJI: With the Goa electricity department looking to mop up a revenue gap of approximately Rs 80 crore for the 2018-19 fiscal, consumers are likely to face a 5% hike in power charges across the board.

 In a public notice of its petition filed before the   (JERC) as part of the due process for finalisation of tariff, the department has stated that the revenue gap for the year 2018-19 is Rs 473 crore.
 
 The deficit will largely be met through the government’s budgetary support of Rs 394 crore and the balance through a hike in retail tariff.
 
 The petition has been put in the public domain through the department’s website for objections and suggestions from the consumers and public. The last date for submissions is January 20, 2018.
 
 “The JERC, after perusing written objections received in response to this notice, may invite objections as it considers appropriate for a hearing on the specified dates to be notified by the   in due course,” the notice states.
 
 The consumers in the state have raised several issues at past hearings about the department’s functioning with regard to its financial management and other issues.
 
 “The department has to come up with a plan to tackle wastage and pilferage of power in all sectors, domestic, commercial and industrial,” said   of Goa civic and consumer action network (GOACAN). “This will in turn reduce the trust deficit that exists between the consumers and the department.” 
 
 Further, it can also initiate an intensive drive on energy conservation and better financial management through timely recovery of dues and settling of related disputes. “A tariff hike should be seen as the last resort to bridge the revenue gap after exhausting all other avenues,”   said.
