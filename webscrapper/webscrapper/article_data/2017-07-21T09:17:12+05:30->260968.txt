NEW DELHI: Seems there is no stopping social media gaffes when it comes to Indian women cricket team. While a journalist irked Indian woman captain Mithali Raj during a press conference asking her to name her favourite male cricketer,   found himself in an embarrassing situation when he congratulated Mithali on becoming the leading run-getter in women’s ODI with a photo of Punam Raut. 

 Continuing with the unfortunate trend, it was IPL Chairman   who, in a bid to put out a congratulatory tweet for the Women’s team after they had beaten Australia by 36 runs in the second semi-final of the ICC Women’s World Cup to enter the final, got the name of the competition wrong. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Shukla tweeted congratulating the team for making it to the final of the ‘Champions Trophy’. It was roughly a month back that Indian men’s cricket team made it to the final of the ICC   which they eventually lost to Pakistan. The ensuing saga of skipper Kohli not being happy with the then coach Anil Kumble that led to Kumble’s resignation helped Champions Trophy remain a key trend for the coming weeks, and probably the reason why Shukla found himself still stuck in the Champions Trophy fervour giving Women’s World Cup a miss. 
 
 Shukla was quick to delete the tweet and send out couple of updated tweets. But eagle-eyed users had captured the screenshots of the tweet before it was deleted. 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 As for the match itself, India stunned defending champions Australia by 36 runs to secure a spot in final after an undefeated 171 by Harmanpreet Kaur provided the platform for victory. With their first win over six-time champions Australia in World Cup knockout cricket, India will now play tournament hosts England in the sold-out Lord's final on Sunday.
