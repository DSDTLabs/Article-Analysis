PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Not satisfied with its performance, the   mayor has demanded complete transformation of the civic sports department.

 After a review meeting on Tuesday, mayor Nitin Kalje said the annual budgetary provision for this department has been Rs 19 crore, of which Rs 7 crore has been allotted for administrative expenses while the rest is for the purchase of equipment and other activities. “However, the performance of this department is poor considering its budget allocation,” the mayor said.
 
 The department’s office is located at Annasaheb Magar Stadium, so senior officials cannot monitor the work of the officials and employees there, he said. As a result, efforts will be made to shift the department’s office to the PCMC main office building for better monitoring, Kalje added.
 
 “There are 79 gymnasiums of the department, of which 38 are run by the civic body while 41 are run by voluntary organisations. I have directed that a survey of all gymnasiums be conducted. The equipment in the civic-run gymnasiums are old, prompting people to go to the private gymnasiums. Efforts need to be made to provide latest equipment to civic gymnasiums too,” the mayor said.
 
 Kalje has given directions to take immediate action for teaching mallakhamb, yoga and gymnastics in all civic schools. Sports competitions of a minimum of 20 sports be held in all these schools, winners of which will be given cash prizes with momentos. Mayor’s trophy competition for wrestling, kabaddi, kho kho and other games will also be held.
 
 Former mayor   said, “Dieticians and physicians should also be appointed for sportspersons.”
