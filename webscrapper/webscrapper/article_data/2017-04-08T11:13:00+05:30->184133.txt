INDORE: Nineteen per cent of school and 16 per cent college students who were asked questions in the study accepted they have more than one account on  . Many of them said they have also created fake accounts.

 Having more than one account could probably mean the extra account is used for the wrong reasons. If this account is in a wrong or fictitious name then it adds to the suspicion.
 
 It is also wrong for the creator of the fake account to sign into Facebook by providing correct information and doing this amounts to impersonation.
 
 Though a largest chunk of school (32%) and college students (47%) say their privacy settings on Facebook are turned on to ‘friends only’, there is always the danger of ‘friending’ people they do not know in the real world. 
 
 “If you make a stranger a ‘friend’ just based on a friend request, then it is as good as keeping your privacy settings on ‘public’. Giving everyone access to one’s Facebook profile is indeed a dangerous proposition because it opens up the user to all kinds of social engineering attacks as well as the nefarious designs of online predators,” said Varun Kapoor, ADG.
