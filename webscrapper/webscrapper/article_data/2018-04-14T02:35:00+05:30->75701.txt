So while he used to work at the petrol station during the day time, he used to return to the jail premises after his duty hours were over. On Friday morning, while working at the petrol bunk, Rao complained of chest pain and collapsed. He was immediately rushed to the hospital in the premises of the jail, and later shifted to the government general hospital where he passed away.
