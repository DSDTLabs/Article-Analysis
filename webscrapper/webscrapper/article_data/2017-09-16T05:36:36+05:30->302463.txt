Fans of the couple were not the only ones, as  's mother   was equally shocked over her daughter and actor  's split after eight years of marriage.

  Fergie's mother expressed that she didn't know that the couple had separated until she was notified by a news website.
 
  When the website asked about the ' ' singer and Josh's separation after 13 years together, Jackson said,
 
  "What? This is the first I'm hearing of this. I don't get it."
 
  Terri just went at the fourth birthday of couple's son,  , last week, and didn't see any telltale signs that they had parted ways.
 
  She said, "I was there. They seemed happy, and added that she assumed Fergie didn't tell her the news 'because she didn't want to break my heart."
 
 According to a report, Terri told, Fergie's hectic schedules could be the reason of the split, saying, "I know they work a lot. I knew they were never together because they are both travelling a lot."
 
  The 42-year-old singer is promoting her upcoming new album 'Double Dutchess', which is set for release next week.
 
  Former ' ' singer and ' ' actor Josh released a statement recently about their divorce, where they announced, "With absolute love and respect, we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year."
 
  The couple got married in 2009 in Malibu and share a son Axl.
