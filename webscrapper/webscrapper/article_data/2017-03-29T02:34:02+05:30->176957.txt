MUMBAI: A BEST bus driver left, who left a   seriously injured due to his rash driving and over speeding, has cost the undertaking Rs 5 lakh. The Motor Accidents Claims   ordered the amount to be paid as compensation to the now 30-year-old biker, Kaushik Katariya, who had suffered severe leg injuries in the accident in 2010. The court refuted the driverâ€™s defence that the biker had rammed into the   in a bid to avoid an open manhole. 

 Katariya filed the application seeking compensation on June 17, 2010. He told the tribunal that the accident took place on April 5, 2010 around 9:45pm. He said that when he was riding his motorcycle at the Andheri-Ghatkopar link road near Sakinaka, the bus suddenly rammed into him. He was admitted in hospital from April 6 to May 5, 2010 he underwent a surgery. He also said that due to the injuries he had to make special arrangements for his travel to and from the hospital for further treatment.
 
 The BEST contended that the motorcyclist, while trying to save himself from an open manhole, suddenly applied the brakes, lost control, skidded and dashed against the front wheel of the bus. It said that under such circumstances the application should be dismissed.
 
 Denying the allegations, Katariya told the tribunal that he was on the right side of the bus when he was hit and he did not see it coming from behind. He also clarified that he had slowed down when he came close to the manhole and had applied the brakes. Katariya denied having lost his balance and falling off the bike. 
 
 During the cross examination the bus driver admitted that on that night the bus was late and he had to get it to Kurla by 11.30 pm. The tribunal said it was proved that the accident was caused due to the rashness and negligence of the bus driver.
