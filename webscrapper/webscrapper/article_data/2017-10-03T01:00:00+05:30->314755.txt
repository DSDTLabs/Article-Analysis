Child prodigy Akshat  , who has been part of international talk shows like The Ellen Degeneres Show and Little Big Shots, will soon be seen with actor-choreographer-filmmaker   in a Tamil film. 
The 12-year-old, who rose to fame on a dance reality show, says, “I have met   sir once, on a TV show in the South. It will be a great learning experience to dance with a legend like him. I love grooving to the song, Tera Hi Jalwa from Wanted (directed by Prabhudheva), which features my favourite hero,  .”
 With a packed schedule, how tough does he find it to manage studies? “I top my exams, too. So, it’s not as if I am ignoring my education. I have got good opportunities thanks to my passion for dance and I feel that I am truly blessed,” he replies.
