PUDUCHERRY: Coming down heavily on   national secretary H   for his adverse remarks apparently on DMK leader M Karunanidhi’s daughter and Rajya Sabha MP  , Puducherry chief minister V   on Thursday asked the Tamil Nadu government to initiate action against the BJP leader.

 Narayanasamy called Raja’s tactics of making adverse remarks on leaders of opposition parties a cheap publicity stunt to gain the attention of one and all. He said Raja’s remark was also an attempt to dilute and divert the attention of people from several burning issues facing the country.
 
 He held the poor economic policies of the BJP-led Union government responsible for the ATMs running dry. He said demonetisation and the introduction of goods and services tax had spelt doom and led to the cash crunch witnessed now.
