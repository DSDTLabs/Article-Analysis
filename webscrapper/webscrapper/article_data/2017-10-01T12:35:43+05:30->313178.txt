MADURAI: Eight phases of excavation works have been carried out at   since 1986. The eighth one – the biggest of all which cost Rs 55 lakhs – could be termed as one of the parting gifts of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa to the archaeology treasure of   as she announced the project through a government order dated September 1, 2016.

 The seven phases carried out between 1986 and 1998 were smaller ones with a minimum funding not exceeding a few lakh rupees. 
 
 The eighth phase carried out nearly on one acre of land at Kottaimedu was very rewarding, according to archaeologists. 
 
 “With the amount of evidence we have collected in this phase, it could be deduced that at least 10 years of elaborate research and exploration are required to cover the entire Alagankulam”, stated Dr J Baskar, Director of the excavation works. 
 
 When Archaeological Survey of India, Bangalore circle took out a survey in 2013 to find possible excavation sites along the Vaigai, both the originating point of the river in Varusanadu Hills and end point at Alagankulam in Ramanathapuram were included. 
 
 Between these sites, nearly 100 potential sites were identified with the assumption that Alagankulam was a port city of the ancient Tamil   in the region and Keezhadi was shortlisted for the major excavation. Alagankulam as port city could have possible links to Keezhadi, a trade centre on Vaigai banks. 
 
 State archaeology minister K Pandiarajan was said to be instrumental in facilitating the excavation works at Alagankulam and he could extend his support to carry out more studies in the region, opined V Rajaguru of Ramanathapuram Archaeological Foundation. 
 
 “The entire Ramanathapuram district is like a treasure trove of archaeology waiting to be explored. If the state government prolongs the study at Alagankulam and takes out pilot studies in other potential areas, it will yield much”, he added.
