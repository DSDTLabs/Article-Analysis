CHANDIGARH: Members of the Chandigarh Tree Lovers group will organize a   at the Sukhna forest area on Sunday.

 Group members said bird experts from the Chandigarh forest and wildlife department would guide the group of environment enthusiasts in the forest area.
 
 Bird-watching is part of a series of events the CTL has planned to engender awareness about the city's green heritage among residents. They will be apprised about the various species of trees in the Sukhna forest area.
 
 Since the formation of CTL last year, the group has organized events like tree walks in forests and gardens, lectures and seminars on the trees of Chandigarh.
 
 According to  , founding member of the group and former principal,   of Architecture, all these events are aimed at generating love and awareness among residents for their green heritage.
 
 "The city is blessed to have such a large variety of trees, whose plantation was part of the original master plan of Chandigarh. Different varieties of trees were planted on roadsides in a planned manner to ensure ample sunlight in the winter and dense shade in the summer. Also, the city's green cover is one of the highest in the country. No other city can boast of such a unique green splendor. It is our responsibility to save and preserve it from decay and harm," said Wattas.
 
 In the past, the group held events at Sukhna Lake, Leisure Valley, Kansal forest area, Sukhna forest and Sukhna lake, among others. CTL is a TOI initiative.
