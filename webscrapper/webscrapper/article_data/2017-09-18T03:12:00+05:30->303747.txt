Nagpur: The renewed popularity of Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the region has been confirmed with vacancies coming down from a high of 60% to just 6% this academic year.

 After all rounds of centralized admission process (CAP), that ended on August 28, just 246 out of the total 4,164 seats remained vacant. In 2013, just 1,770 had taken admission against 5,100 seats available in the region. 
 
 On August 30, TOI was the first to report the turnaround in MBA admissions with most colleges having no vacancies after the third round of CAP.
 
 Across the 46 institutes in the region, 3,918 students were finally admitted for the post graduate management course. The final round of CAP was held on July 27 when 540 seats were left. It was believed these too would be taken up by August end. Experts and DTE officials feel admission cancellations may have left 246 seats vacant.
 
 In the academic year 2016-17, the unfilled seats are more than three times higher at 807. At 48 institutes, 4,404 seats were available but only 3,597 were taken. Another year before that, total vacancies were 1,640. In 2015-16, the number of institutes too was more at 56 having 5,500 sanctioned intake. In 2014-15, 1,898 seats were left vacant in 56 institutes having total intake of 5548 while in 2013-14 a whopping 3,330 seats had remained vacant out of 5,100 in 56 colleges.
 
 The turnaround has been attributed to aggressive promotion on social media by institutes, high employability of MBA graduates, and improvement in teaching in local colleges.
 
 Vinayak Deshpande, professor and dean of Commerce and Management faculty, said it was cyclical. “In one phase, you will see there are more admissions while next year it may be less. Demand for MBA also depends on what kind of jobs the course helps students get,” he said. He added that migration of students to Pune and Mumbai colleges too had declined.
 
 Another factor making the difference is a new trend among engineering graduates who account for most of MBA aspirants. “Parents are no more pressuring kids to work soon after engineering. They are ready to give their children another two years to complete studies. This is a new trend,” Deshpande said, adding the combination of management and engineering was considered ideal.
 
 A plain engineering graduate or MBA without engineering was getting low paying jobs which is why students had started looking for other options after their graduation, he said.
