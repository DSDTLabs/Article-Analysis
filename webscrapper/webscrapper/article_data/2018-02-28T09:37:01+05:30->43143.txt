CHENNAI: After his decision to conduct review meetings with officials of district administrations drew opposition ire,   governor   seems to have turned his attention on the industrialists and industry houses in the state and overtly reaching out to them.

 
 Notably, his recent statements that   was open to industry representatives to discuss their problems and that the Centre was keen on developing and promoting investments in Tamil Nadu have not gone down well with the opposition,   and others. They have accused the governor for continuing to make a mockery of the constitution, while the state government was busy bidding farewell to investments in the state.
 
 “Together, the governorgovernment combination is watching as we hurtle down into the dark abyss of a dysfunctional democracy. It has been the DMK’s long-held position that the governor is a superfluous authority. Had the   foreseen the present situation in Tamil Nadu, they would have endorsed this stand,” DMK spokesperson   said, pointing to governor’s direct call to entrepreneurs to approach him in Raj Bhavan and that he would get the work done immediately by speaking to the chief minister. The party has been holding black flag protests against governor’s visit to districts and review meet with official machinery.
 
 Some industry representatives were cautious in their reaction. “Whenever we have an issue, we go to the industries secretary to sort out the problems. Recently, we even met the chief minister as a delegation and had a lengthy discussion with him. I have not heard about the governor reaching out to the industry,” an office bearer with   said.
