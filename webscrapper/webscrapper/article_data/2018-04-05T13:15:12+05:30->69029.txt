GAYA:   Jitendra Srivastava has warned the district   against harassing the students seeking scholarship or incentive money under the state government’s scheme. He asked the welfare officer to immediate pay the scholarship/incentive money to the applicants or face action. The commissioner on Tuesday sought the compliance report in this regard next week.

 One Sonam Kumari approached the commissioner on Tuesday as per the provisions of the Public Grievance Redressal Act with her complaint that the district welfare officer did not pay her the scholarship money despite the fact that she passed Class XII examination in first division and was entitled to the benefit announced by the state government. Taking Sonam’s complaint seriously, the commissioner directed the welfare officer to ensure early payment of the scholarship money to her and all other aggrieved students failing which he would be penalised monetarily.
 
 Complaints of harassment of students seeking stipend/scholarship have been common in the district. “Students who do not grease the palms of the officials concerned are subjected to unnecessary harassment,” activist SB Bhaskar said. TNN
