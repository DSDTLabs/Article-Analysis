PUNE: Empty space under flyovers often become an eyesore littered with  ,  . To avoid such a scenario at the  , the   plans to develop a traffic island, parking lots, a garden and a care centre for senior citizens. 

 The initiative by   (PCMC) will benefit around 6,000 local residents. This will also reduce the traffic congestion on the Pune-Mumbai highway as vehicles parked on the highway will now have a spot to park under the flyover.
 
 The municipal body is constructing a 1.9km-long flyover on the Kalewadi phata-Dehu Alandi Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) route in Chinchwad. The 27 metre-wide flyover will be the longest in the municipal limits. About 500 metres of the flyover passes through the Empire Estate housing society, that has 1,600 flats, 200 shops, 22 row-houses and 15 bungalows.
 
 The residents have been complaining for over five years that people coming to shop in the nearby commercial complexes park their vehicles in a haphazard manner below the flyover and on the road. This makes moving their vehicles difficult. The situation becomes worse on weekends. 
 
 About a year ago, a one-way system was introduced to tackle this problem.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Vijay Bhojane, spokesperson for the BRTS cell at the civic body said, “The road is 45 metres wide, of which a seven-meter strip on both sides is used as one-way for vehicular movement by local residents. This leaves 31 metres left unused under the flyover which we will be using to provide amenities to local citizens.” The work is expected to be completed in six months,” he added.
