THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Contrasting with the popular notion that accidents occur at late midnight or when it rains, the statistical wing of the state crime records bureau has found that the highest number of accidents happened at the hours between 3pm and 9pm during clear weather conditions. 

  
  
 
 As per the report of the state crime records bureau for road accidents in the state for 2017, accessed by TOI, while 38,470 accidents happened last year, 1,605 persons were killed in the time between the hours of 3pm and 9pm.
 
 The highest number of people died-808-in accidents that occurred between the hours of 6pm and 9pm. "As many as 12,610 persons sustained grievous injuries while 5,680 persons sustained minor injuries between the hours of 6pm and 9pm," the report states. Out of the total 3,915 fatal accidents reported in the state in 2017, 3,131 occurred during clear weather conditions killing 3,323 persons. Motor vehicles department officials find several reasons for these findings. "During rainy seasons, people tend to be cautious while driving on slippery roads. The tendency to over-speed would be lesser, unlike in bright sunny weather conditions. Regarding the hours between 3pm and 9pm, more cases of drunken driving have been observed between these hours, which could be a major contributing factor to the accidents," transport commissioner   said.
 
 The month of May recorded the highest number of accidents (3,480 cases) when compared to other months, and which include 393 fatal   cases, 2,384 grievous injury cases and 580 minor injury cases. The total number of people killed in May last year was 412. The highest number of accidents in 2017 was reported from   district, where 407 persons were killed.
 
 The accident statistics also makes it clear that newer vehicles were the highest contributors to the road accidents. Of the total 4,131 persons killed, 3,226 died in accidents involving vehicles below 10 years of age. Another observation made in the report contradicting the popular notion is that over-loaded vehicles were least involved in accidents when compared to normally loaded or empty vehicles.
 
 While 3,625 persons were killed in accidents involving normally-loaded vehicles, 290 persons were killed in accidents involving empty vehicles. Only 216 lives were lost in accidents involving overloaded vehicles. The report concludes the prime reason behind the accidents in the state was over-speeding. Of the 4,131 accident deaths, 3,679 were killed due to over-speeding. In addition, of the 29,733 persons who sustained grievous injuries, 26,891 were involved in over-speeding.
