While Roshini Prakash and Suman Ranganathan were the two female names announced this far, Hemanth has now revealed that RJ Siri and model Samanvita Shetty will be coming on-board for the project.
Speaking about the casting, Hemanth says, “Siri has been a part of quite a few art films under famous directors, and her quality of work reflects that. Samanvita, on the other hand, is relatively new, having only worked in ad films prior to this. But at the auditions, she impressed us the most with her performance and suited the role perfectly. Both of them were chosen keeping in mind that they need to play characters that are set in the 70s.”
 Hemanth elaborates more on their roles, saying, “Siri is cast opposite Ananth Nag sir for a segment of the story that’s set in the past. Her character is that of a wife of a police officer in a typical middle-class household and it is seen from her husband Ananth sir’s point of view. As for Samanvita’s character, she’s a rich, fashionable woman from around the same timeline — donning sleeveless blouses, pearl necklace and the like — who inadvertently gets entangled in a robbery.”
 Hemanth, who won rave reviews for his first film,  , is directing Kavaludaari on a bigger scale, getting the backing of   and big production houses.
