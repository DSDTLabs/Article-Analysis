BIHARSHARIF: Chief minister   inaugurated the month-long   on the Bramhkund premises in   on Wednesday morning.

 Nitish, who had reached Rajgir on Tuesday night, participated in prayers in the morning that followed the hoisting of religious flags by the sadhus and devotees who later took out a ‘dharamrath yatra’.
 
 The CM also reviewed the arrangements of the Mela with the state and district officials and directed them to ensure smooth stay for the visitors coming to the Mela.
 
 Nalanda district magistrate Thiyagarajan S M said extensive preparations have been made to ensure safety, security and comfortable stay of the visitors including sadhus, who come from across the country.
 
 The DM said that as many as 549 magistrates, 353 police officers and a large contingent of police force had been deployed to ensure proper security of the visitors. Apart from setting up a special Mela police station, 84 CCTV cameras had also been installed around the entire premises to keep a constant vigil. Proper drinking water and sanitation arrangements had also been put in place, added the DM.
 
 "According to Hindu mythology, malmas, also known as adhimas, is regarded very sacred and offering prayers to Lord Shiva and Vishnu here in this month is considered to be highly beneficial. In fact, taking bath in the hot springs and worshipping the gods and goddess give salvation and peace. The hot springs at Rajgir is the added attraction for the visitors. Eralier there were 22 kunds and 52 flows of hot springs many of them have now dried up. The first mela of the new millennium began on September 18 2001,” said   and added, “No religious functions including marriages are organized during this month for as the legend goes that all deities reside here".
 
 The Malmas Mela, which has recently been included in the list of state festivals by the cabinet, will conclude on June 13.
