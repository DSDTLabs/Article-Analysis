Margao: The NGO Goans For Dabolim Only ( ), on Thursday, submitted a memorandum to minister of town and country planning (TCP), Vijai Sardesai, reiterating their demand to scrap the proposed Mopa airport project.

 The GFDO delegation led by its convenor Fr Eremito Rebelo pointed out that ‘the TCP minister will be presiding over a draft regional plan that has been prepared with the proposed Mopa airport as its basis. ... In light of your recent endeavour as TCP minister to preserve and protect traditional homes, you will surely consider the fact that this project will demand the destruction of traditional homes, heritage structures, agricultural lands and ecological hotspots to make way for the new infrastructure that is a pre-condition for the second airport.’
