Indore: Going from the frying pan into the fire, a person died in an accident after he tried to flee with a two-wheeler he stole in Lasudia area on Wednesday.

 The man was found lying on the road in front of Omaxe City in MR 11 area while the two-wheeler lying beside him. Locals and beat officials approached him and rushed him to hospital but he was declared dead on arrival by authorities there.
 
 The investigating officer at Lasudia police station said that sources claimed the man died after he got trapped under a heavy vehicle involved in the accident. “Prima facie it appeared as if the man was speeding and hit a boulder on the dimly lit road. The two-wheeler’s handle hit him in the chest, grievously injuring him,” the officer said.
 
 While trying to ascertain the identity of the accused, police traced the vehicle’s registration plate and found it belonged to K Patel, a resident of Kumharpipliya.
 
 During interrogations, he revealed that someone had stolen his vehicle while it was parked outside his house and he too was also on the lookout for the accused.
 
 Police claimed they were still in the process of trying to ascertain the accused’s identity.
 
 The vehicle was returned to the owner after proper documentation work was done.
