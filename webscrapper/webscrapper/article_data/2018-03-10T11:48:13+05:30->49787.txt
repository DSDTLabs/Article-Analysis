In a landmark decision made by the Supreme Court today,   got a go ahead. In its decision, the apex court allowed the suffering individuals to state in a record that they do not wish to get treated further and all medical attention is withdrawn from them. 

 Euthanasia refers to the painless killing of a patient, who is either in a vegetative state or going through a non-reversible disease. There are two types of Euthanasias which are broadly used in medical terms, active and passive. 
 
 
 
 While many sources say that there is hardly any difference between active and passive Euthanasia and that both ultimately lead to the untimely and unnatural death of a person. However, as per research, Active Euthanasia means that the medical professional deliberately does something that leads to the death of the patient. Passive Euthanasia, on the other hand, refers to the complete deprivation of any further medical treatment such as slowly getting rid of useful medicines and discontinuation of basics such as food and water so that the patient dies under strained circumstances. It can be said that active euthanasia is killing while passive euthanasia is letting die.
 
 The debate over passive Euthanasia is simple. Many believe that it is acceptable to withhold medical treatment and allowing the patient to die as it means that their suffering will stop once and for all. 
 
 Passive Euthanasia can mean giving the patient painkillers that can eventually lead to death. Active Euthanasia can include the decision of the patient himself or herself or their family members to let the patient die. 
 
 The subject of Euthanasia was also covered in the movie   starring   and  .
