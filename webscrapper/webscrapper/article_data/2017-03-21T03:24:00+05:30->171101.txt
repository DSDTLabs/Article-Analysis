Patna: A Bihar police team led by Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj nabbed  , one of the main accused in the case of leakage of questions of Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC)’s competitive examination, from New Delhi on Monday.

 A Delhi resident, Brar was the evaluator of the answer books of BSSC’s examinations. 
 
 BSSC’s suspended chairman Sudhir Kumar and suspended secretary Parmeshwar Ram are among the 34 accused arrested so far in connection with the scam that rocked the state in February. The scam pertains to leaking questions to help favourite candidates clear the examination for recruitment as clerk in state government departments.
 
 Maharaaj told TOI over the phone on Monday evening the SIT got information about Brar’s whereabouts a few days ago. “We left for Delhi on Sunday... Brar was arrested near AIIMS,” he said.
 
 Sources said Brar would manipulate the OMR sheets of the applicants, who paid for the leaks. Sudhir is an IAS official of 1987 batch. Contrary to earlier reports, police now say they are not on the lookout for another IAS official, C K Anil, who is the OSD in the BSSC. 
 
 It was earlier reported that he did not appear before police for questioning despite a summon, and has not been attending his office for several days now.
 
 “The SIT does not have any evidence suggesting Anil’s involvement in the scam,” a senior officer at state police HQ said on Monday.
