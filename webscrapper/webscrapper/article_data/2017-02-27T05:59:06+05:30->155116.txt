MUMBAI: The   are a big test for the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and   as the bookkeeping and accounts   got leaked in the last two years. Board officials want to ensure there isn't a repeat.

 “The papers were circulated on WhatsApp, so we are asking supervisors and cent re heads not to use mobile phones,“ said  , secretary of the Mumbai division. Last year, students had images of question paper almost half an hour before the exam.
 
 The board has also reduced the number of sub-centres. “This year, we have subcentres only if a centre cannot accommodate the students assigned to them. This will ensure papers don't travel through too many hands,“ said Chandekar.
