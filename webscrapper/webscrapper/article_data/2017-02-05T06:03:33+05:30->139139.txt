KOCHI: The number of vehicles with fake number plates on highways is rising, sounding alarm bells in the   (MVD). The MVD, while analysing registrations of vehicles caught on   cameras across the state for over speeding in the last two years, found that almost 500 vehicle registrations were “fake”. The registration numbers were captured by around 200 cameras placed by MVD both on national and state highways.

  An MVD official said that when they tried to verify certain registration numbers in their official records, they would find that a number of an over-speeding car would belong to that of a bike, an auto or another vehicle. “We receive several complaints from people who are issued notices that they have never travelled on a particular route on a particular date. They also furnish evidence to show that the vehicle captured on camera is not theirs,” said M Suresh, Enforcement RTO in Ernakulam.
 
  RTO officials revealed that if a vehicle with “fake registration” is involved in an accident there are other ramifications as well. “It is difficult to trace such vehicles and we have to drop hit-and-run cases midway leaving victims in the lurch. Victims are also deprived of the benefit of availing third party insurance”, Suresh said.
 
  The transport department, that is preparing the Safe Kerala project to improve road transportation in the state, has agreed to chip in. “We suspect that people may be using fake registration numbers to indulge in illegal activities. We will be working on how to deal with the problem while preparing the Safe Kerala project,” said P B Sunil Babu, traffic safety expert, Road Safety Authority.
