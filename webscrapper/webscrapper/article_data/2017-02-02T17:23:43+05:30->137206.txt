PUNE: The   in   would be reviewed and unnecessary part would be deleted,   state education secretary Nand Kumar said on Thursday. The Sociology textbook by the Maharashtra state board of secondary and higher secondary education for standard XII carried offensive content while it described ‘ugly’ in one of the chapters.

 In chapter 3 titled 'Major social problems in India', ugliness was defined in a derogatory manner, said educationists. It said: "If a girl is ugly and handicapped, then it becomes a very difficult for her to get married. To marry such girls, bridegroom and his family demand more dowry. Parents of such girls become helpless and pay dowry as per the demands of the bridegroom as family. It leads to rise in the practice of dowry system."
 
 When this was brought to the notice of the state education secretary Kumar, who was touring Amravati, he told TOI that, "We will issue notices to the concerned person on such remarks in the textbooks. We will be speaking to the textbook authorities in the Maharashtra state board and get the paragraph revised and delete unnecessary part."
 
 Kumar also said that, the textbook undergoes at least two to three levels of scrutiny before it is published and it is surprising how none of the experts on the textbook committee found it offensive.
 
 Activist   said that, "The paragraph is definitely offensive on the part of handicapped and ugly individuals on the whole and this is not for the first time that the education department has got into such major goof ups when it comes to creation of content. Stricter measures to scrutinise the textbooks is required."
