BHOPAL: A day after life imprisonment was awarded to Asaram for raping a minor girl, the residents of   in   have demanded to change the name of their colony. Residents feel that the name of the colony has ashamed them. 

 Sant Asaram Nagar is situated near Bagsewaniya police station. Around 250 families are living in the colony.
 
 Residents came out on road and erased the colony name wherever it was written on the campus. Even women joined the bandwagon and tore apart the name plates written dedicated to the convicted godman.
 
 Residents said it is shameful for them that their colony name is Sant Asaram Nagar. "We are living here for past 12 years. We had never imagined that one day the name of the colony will become a bane for us," said Sant Asaram Nagar welfare society member NP Agarwal.
 
 Around four years ago, the resident welfare society of colony had dropped using Sant from the name of the colony. "A rapist can't be a sant. We residents unanimously dropped the word sant from the name," said SN Gupta, resident of Asaram Nagar.
 
 Residents said their colony had been disgraced by the name. "We feel awkward when we share our address with anyone. Why would we continue with the name of a personality, who has been awarded life imprisonment by the court? Even our children do not want to continue with this name," said another resident  .
 
 Residents have also decided to meet collector in this regard. "At present, all kinds of correspondence is being done to change the name of Sant Asaram Nagar. We will formally meet the collector to present our memorandum in this regard," said another resident of the colony. On Wednesday, Mayor   had removed a board mentioning as Sant Asaram bus stop.
