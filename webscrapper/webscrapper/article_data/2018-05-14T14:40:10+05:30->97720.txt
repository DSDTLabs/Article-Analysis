NAGPUR: Consumers in India fancy affordable, durable and attractive products without checking their quality and safety. In the process, gullible consumers get fleeced by companies which attract them with promises that turn out to be false, said  , a professional in the field, on Saturday.

 Delivering a lecture on ‘Indian industrialists and mentality of consumers’, organized by Dr   at   of Dharampeth Mulanchi Shala, Jogwar said heavy discounts and offers are the perfect way to convince people to buy a product. They are not smart enough to scoop out details and spend money without much realization. 
 
 He spoke about consumer behaviour in India and presented a comparative analysis with eastern and western countries of the world. 
 
 Jogwar said, “Days after consumers bring the item home from malls, they realize that it is not worth it. They do not pay heed to the genuineness of the commodity and keep on wasting their hard earned money. In contrast, they will become an ‘aware’ consumer to use their excellent bargaining skills with vegetable vendors who already have very less profit margin.”
 
 Indian consumers are easily influenced by mouth to mouth publicity, advertisements and aesthetics. Status symbol is another factor. Jogwar said, “People have a tendency to buy high rated products with a brand value only to prove that they are capable to own it. On the other hand, consumers in the western countries believe in smart shopping which is a good practice.”
