Meerut: The Meerut Cantonment Board (MCB) has decided to come down hard on what it calls “illegal encroachments” on its land in busy city areas. The MCB has identified 140 such encroachments in Sadar, Lal Kurti and Cantonment hospital areas, which will now face demolition in mid June.   The MCB will take the support of district administration and police during the eviction process. Several shops and residential units have come up illegally in the Cantonment area.    However, many are cynical over the MCB’s identification process.    “How do they identify this? Every land in Cantonment area belongs to Cantonment board. They cannot ask everyone to vacate. They just get up one day and tell people that they don’t have a valid lease agreement. There should be a proper process in place by which these encroachments are identified,” said a resident of the Cantonment area.    The MCB claims that it has come up with a survey that will eliminate any chance mistake.    “We will be conducting a survey, and will not demolish the properties which are legal. Only those living illegally will face the brunt. These properties can be identified from our records and we are in the process of doing that. We will also conduct a door-to-door survey. A strict process will be followed,” said MA Zafar, media officer, MCB.    The civic body is hopeful that the demolitions will be over before middle of next month.    “We are hoping to do this soon, because, during the monsoon, things will get difficult. Now, we want to complete this by mid-June. Our teams are working overtime on this and most probably it will be done on time,” Zafar added.
