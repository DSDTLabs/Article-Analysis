LUCKNOW:   will be the first in the country to provide   to commuters at all 21 metro stations of the  . The stations will have a kiosk providing purified,   to commuters free.   Rail Corporation (LMRC) is also going to provide free toilet facility at each of its stations. 

 No other metro project in country has offered the facilities free so far. An official said, “We are building three   each for men and women and one seat for physically challenged persons at all 21 metro stations. These will be available only for commuters who pay using token or the Go-Smart card.”
 
 The drinking water kiosk and toilet facilities will be available at the concourse level (above ground floor) which is accessible only after buying tokens to enter the paid area of the metro stations. An official told TOI, “Other metro stations earn revenue from these facilities but we will give these services to public free.” The idea drew appreciation from ‘Metro Man’ E Sreedharan who came to inspect Lucknow Metro, recently. 
 
 To prevent littering on the stations’ premises, LMRC will not keep disposable glasses or bottles near the kiosk and commuters will have to bring own bottles for refill. Officials said, “It will be an environment-conscious project, so we will discourage use of plastic at our stations.” 
 
 Lucknow Metro is expecting commissioner of metro railway safety (CMRS) to inspect the depot and Lucknow Metro corridor around month-end and accordingly aims to begin commercial run of trains on priority section of 8.5km by mid-August.
