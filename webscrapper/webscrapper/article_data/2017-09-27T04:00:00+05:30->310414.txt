Surat: With rains abating, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has taken up the work to strengthen a 185 metre patch of the runway at Surat airport from Tuesday. 

 Surtis hope more private airlines will connect the Diamond City with domestic destinations in the country once the full length runway of 2,905 m is commissioned by the second week of October. 
 
 The airport authorities could not achieve the target of commissioning the full length runway of 2,905 m due to delay in the work to strengthen 185 m patch of the runway. The expansion of 2,905 m runway and the 185 m strengthening work were supposed to be completed by end of 2016. However, the work got delayed by almost six months due to manpower shortage and lackadaisical attitude of the authorities. The work to strengthen the 185 metre runway patch had to be stopped due to heavy rains in August. 
 
 For limited international operations, the airport needs 2,905 m runway, which has been reduced to close to 1,900 m due to ongoing work to strengthen the patch.
 
 Sources said the 185 m runway is located in the middle of the existing runway. Due to recarpeting and strengthening work, the entire 1,000 m runway was not in use. At present, the usable length of the runway at the airport is just 1,905 m, which is not enough for landing of wide-bodied aircraft. 
 
 “We hope to complete the work to strengthen 185 m patch on the runway in the next 15 days, provided the city does not receive rainfall. Since, many things are involved in the strengthening work of the runway patch, we do not want to take any chances,” airport director Dilip Sajnani said. 
 
 Earlier, Air India Express, which plans to start its international operations between Dubai and Surat, had expressed concern over the slow pace of work at the runway and delay in granting approval for customs status for Surat airport. Without full-length runway of 2,905 m and customs status, Air India Express is unable to operate international flights.
