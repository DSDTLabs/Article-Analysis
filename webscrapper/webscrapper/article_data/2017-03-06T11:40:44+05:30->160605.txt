 Commando 2 The Black Money Trail

 There are only three original songs in this album of seven — 'Commando 2: The Black Money Trail'. While its prequel, 'Commando: A One Man Army', had a desi-folksy vibe with raga-based songs, 
 this one has a completely urban feel. 
 
 Pritam’s ' ' ('Bhool Bhoolaiya', 2007) recreated by   is the first song in the album. Despite Armaan Malik and Ritika doing a decent job, and a catchy rap by Raftaar, this track fails to match up to the super-peppy original.
 
 The next three tracks are composed by   with lyrics by Kumaar and Aatish Kapadia. 'Tere Dil Mein Kya Hai', a soft, rock-pop, romantic number, crooned by Armaan, is a soothing composition with a live 16-piece orchestra doing the string section. However, its 'Club Mix' version is just a pointless addition to the album.
 
 ' ', an intense rock-based desi melody with some interesting major-minor scale transitions, does have a repeat value. Amit Mishra’s ('Bulleya' singer) rendition of the track is noteworthy. But, the talented   does not do enough justice to the reprise version.
 
 Both the Hindi and English versions of the title track Commando can only qualify as a background score with its weak lyrics. However, Aditi Singh Sharma’s powerful, energetic singing and subtle nuances in both are commendable. Though the music is good, this album is definitely not a potential chartbuster.
