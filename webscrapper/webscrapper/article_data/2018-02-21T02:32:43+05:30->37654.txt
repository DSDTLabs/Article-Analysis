GHAZIABAD: Some environmentalists have lodged complaints with the Uttar Pradesh government’s grievance cell and the local police alleging that huge amount of plastic and   materials are being dumped along the   riverbank in Raj Nagar Extension.

 The complainants said at least 50 truckloads of garbage had been dumped at the site over the past few days. The complaint assumes all the more significance as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had threatened to impose environmental compensation on senior officials of the district administration, Ghaziabad Development Authority and the municipal corporation if garbage was dumped along the Hindon river. It had even authorised the officials to impose a fine of Rs 20,000 on defaulters.
 
 The order by the tribunal followed a similar complaint by the environmentalists.
 
 One of the complainants, Vikrant Sharma of Hindon Jal Biradari, an NGO, said: “A large number of scrap dealers have set shop near the river and are dumping plastic and other waste materials on the riverbank. A large portion of the garbage dump is also being burnt on a daily basis. They have even built an illegal path from their shops to the riverbank for this purpose.”
 
 “Three years back, we had raised the same concern and one of the NGO members had even filed a petition in the NGT. The tribunal had pulled up the district authorities and ordered them to make proper arrangements for garbage  ,” Sharma added.
 
 Akash Vashishtha, who heads another NGO, Society for Protection of Environment and Biodiversity, said: “Besides filing a complaint with the authorities, I have also written to chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath, apprising him of the alarming situation. But the authorities have turned a blind eye even after the strong observation of the tribunal.”
 
 District magistrate Ritu Maheshwari said she was not aware of the matter, but would get it checked. “Action will be taken against the defaulters if such a thing is happening,” she added.
