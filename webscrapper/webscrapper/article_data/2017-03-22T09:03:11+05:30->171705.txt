BENGALURU: The state government on Tuesday said it will acquire land for creating burial grounds in every village across the state.

 The government’s promise of creating a 20-gunta burial ground for every village came under scrutiny in the legislative council after a debate ensued over whether the extent of land is available or not in the hinterlands of the state. Questions were raised over the provision of the government buying land from private persons if there’s no government land available, considering that many may not part land for burial grounds.
 
 Revenue minister   said the government will ensure that land, if required, will be more than 20 guntas. “If people do not part with their land, then we will acquire it,” he added.
 
 There was demand for a law to ensure common burial ground for all Hindu communities as there are not enough burial grounds in villages. 
 
 An amount of Rs 9.99 crore has been allocated to 11 districts in 2014-15 and another 5 crore for 30 districts in 2015-16. The government has directed the deputy commissioners to identify kushki land (dry land) for the purpose. Basic facilities will also be provided, the minister said.
