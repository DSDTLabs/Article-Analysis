Smita Patil was confused about a certain shot in Akaler Sandhane. She was not confident how to react to a particular emotion.   asked her to come out of the method acting mould and react naturally. Smita Patil obeyed her director and delivered an expression that could not be matched. Cinematographer KK Mahajan canned the shot in one take.
There are countless examples of Mrinal Sen’s handling of actors with rare expertise. If   was objective to the core, Mrinal Sen improvised on many occasions. He never compromised. Rajen Tarafdar was initially reluctant to act in Akaler Sandhane. After ceaseless persuasion by Mrinal Sen, Rajen Tarafdar’s wife literally compelled him to accept the role. The result was that Tarafdar delivered a lifetime cameo in the film.
 Mrinal Sen always kept away from so-called stars. He worked very well with professionals and amateur actors. He was never the type to impose his views on any actor. Ashok Kumar was keen to perform the male protagonist in Bhuvan Shome. Mrinal Sen knew well that Ashok Kumar was more versatile than Utpal Dutt. Yet, he opted for   as his body language was more suited for the character. Opting for a difficult movement balancing his feet and toes, Utpal Dutt was peerless in Bhuvan Shome.
 The mentor of   and   worked wonders with his discovery of Ranjit Mullick in Interview. The actor won an international award for his performance. Similarly Shabana Azmi’s eyes were used to the hilt in the close-ups in Khandahar. Mrinal Sen’s use of Kali Banerjee as a Chinese, emoting, “Sister, Sister” in Neel Akasher Niche remains a lesson in acting. It was expected that the Mrinal Sen-Dimple Kapadia combination would work magic on screen in Antareen. Dimple Kapadia was too keen to work with the legend. Since Mrinal Sen got Anushua Majumdar to dub Dimple’s voice, the latter was offended. Yet she personally told this writer, her silent moments in Antareen are amongst her best histrionic efforts.
