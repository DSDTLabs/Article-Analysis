 In Gurgaon, 37 cases of swine flu were reported in 2015. Not a single case was reported in 2016. The health   has instructed all government and private hospitals to enhance surveillance on the H1N1 infection. Medical staff has been asked to keep an eye on acute respiratory illnesses. The health department too will form a district-level Rapid Response Team, which will ensure there are isolation wards, ICU beds and ventilators available in hospitals. In fact, government hospitals can also tie up with private organisations to arrange for ventilators. 
 
 Dr B K Rajora, chief medical officer, said awareness drives will be conducted in which people will be informed about coughing etiquettes, maintaining physical distance from suspected or infected patients, and reporting if there are any influenza-like symptoms.
