NAGPUR: Union ministry of urban development has come up with a   (TOD) policy for making Metros viable. 

    influence zone is up to a radius of 500 metre to 800m of the station. Where the distance between the   is less than 1km and there is overlap in the influence area, it can be identified as a delineated zone (around 500m) on either side of the transit corridor within 10 to 12 minutes walking distance. 
 
 The national TOD policy further recommends that it was not necessary to keep the density and   norms consistent for the influence zone across the city. It can vary depending on the infrastructure available, land use zoning, transit capacity etc. 
 
 Mixed land use should be allowed for development or redevelopment in the TOD zone as it would reduce the need for travel by providing most of the activities such as shopping, entertainment and public amenities such as schools, parks, playgrounds and hospitals within walking distance of the residents.
 
 The policy further states that TOD benefits could not be realized with the kind of developments that encourage the use of personalized vehicles. The cities should fix a minimum percentage (30% or higher) of allowed FSI for affordable housing in all development or redevelopment in the influence zones. 
 
 The upper limit to the area of individual dwelling unit should be fixed in the influence zones to ensure housing for low and middle income groups.
