HYDERABAD: Telangana   leaders staged a protest in front of the Ranga Reddy district collectorate in the city and other collectorates in the state on Friday in protest against TRS government's failure to come to the rescue of farmers. 

 Congress leaders-led by   chief   will also meet Governor ESL Narasimhan on Saturday to urge him to use his good offices to ensure farmers are given fresh loans by banks, and also take up the issue with the state and central governments.
 
 Former home minister   who led the dharna in front of the RR district collectorate said both the central and state governments have become anti-farmer. "The TRS government is claiming to have waived of loans of farmers. Actually, this has not been done. The government stll needs to pay money to banks to total waiver of loans. Because of this pending payment, banks are not giving back the passbooks of farmers and not issuing fresh loans," she said.
 
 Senior Congress leader and kisan cell leader of the party Kodanda Reddy said despite tall claims by CM KCR, spurious seeds have hit the market.
