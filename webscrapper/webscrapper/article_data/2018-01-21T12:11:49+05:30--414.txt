KOLHAPUR: KIT’s   of Engineering will host the first ever TEDx talk on January 28 at its campus. According to officials, as many as seven speakers from distinct fields will be part of the event.

 A college official said Chetan Sashital, Prajakta Baste, Yahya Bootwala, Ambika Hiranandani, Gauranga Das, Dinesh Ghodake, and   will be sharing ideas relating to their respective expertise.
 
  Hammannavar, an organising committee member said that all the tickets have already been booked. The lectures will also be live-recorded and made available online within two weeks of the event.
 
 He added that the college has invited people from different backgrounds to ensure that the presentations are based on diverse ideas. Around 100 delegates are expected to attend the event.
 
 He added that the TED talk, which began in the 90’s as an annual conference of Californian technology, is now an idea-exchange forum with a global appeal.
 
 “In 2009, a new version of the independently-organized TED events called TEDx was introduced. Dozens of cities across the world started hosting their own TEDx forums,” Sujay said. 
 
 He further added the main appeal of the event lies in the format it borrows from TED — speeches are kept short, presentations are to-the-point, and the focus is not on theories but on ideas that can be successfully put to practice.
