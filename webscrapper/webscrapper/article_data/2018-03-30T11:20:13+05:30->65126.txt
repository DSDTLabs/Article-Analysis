BHUBANESWAR: Three senior   leaders, former Union minister Chandrasekhar Sahu,   president   and  , resigned on Thursday. They are likely to join BJD on April 4. 

 Sahu said he has sent his resignation to the party high command in New Delhi. The leaders said growing indiscipline within Congress forced them to severe links with the party.
