CHENNAI: Leander   has pretty much achieved it all in tennis. He has participated in a record seven Olympics, won 18 Grand Slam titles and been a role model for youngsters all the way through. He has had to overcome a fair share of obstacles in doing so, more so in 2016, but he never gave up. Now, here to play in the 2017 Chennai Open at 43, he finally seemed to be giving signs of calling it a day in the near future when he told reporters, "I have got a few people new on my team that are going to help me in the last few months of my playing career and my post-tennis career."

 When pressed further, Paes added: "I play for fun now. I play because I love the game. There will come a point when the curtains come down. Before that curtain comes down, I would just like to say thanks to all of you. It's been a fun journey and you guys have been with me for the last 20 years."
 
 The indications were clear to start working on his farewell piece, but Paes told TOI later that he still has a few boxes to tick before retiring from the game. "Retiring? Not true. There are still a few things I want to do. I would love to now help players win their first Grand Slam and blood youngsters more than participating in my eighth Olympics or winning another Major. They are just numbers now," he told TOI.
 
 The Indian   set-up has been in the eye of the storm lately, following   replacing   as the non-playing captain.
 
 When asked whether playing under Bhupathi would be difficult, Paes said that nothing would come in the way of the interests of the country. "When it comes to playing for the flag, that is the primary focus. Yes, there is a lot of media frenzy around both of us. But our aim is to achieve the best for the country."
