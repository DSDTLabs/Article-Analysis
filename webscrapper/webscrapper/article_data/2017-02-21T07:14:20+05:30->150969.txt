HYDERABAD: A horse, with a 17-year-old youth in the saddle,  , knocked down a motorist and hit him with its hooves, killing him on the spot at Vattepally on Sunday night. Another person, who was a pillion rider on the two-wheeler, suffered a fracture on his leg. 

 Around 7.30pm, Hameed   and his friend Khazam were proceeding towards Nawabsakunta from Mailardevpally on a bike. A youth riding the horse came from the opposite direction near Indian Function hall and hit Hameed Sha, 42, police said. 
 
 The two bike-borne men and the animal fell on the road. The animal tried to get back on its feet and kicked repeatedly. Hamed, who by then had suffered grievous injury on his head, took the blow of the horse's hooves on his head and chest. He died on the spot. 
 
 The youth riding the horse fled the spot, though locals chased him. Based on inputs by locals, police found the horse was owned by the youth's family. According to police, they had bought the brown horse three months ago and were renting it out for marriage processions. It was fed barley, oats, grass, jowar and other cereal. 
 
 "The boy could not control the horse and it crashed into the victim's bike. The horse hit Hameed and its blows proved fatal," Mailardevpally sub-inspector   said.
 
 "The youth, an intermediate 2nd year student, had been practising riding, on the road and open spaces, for three months. The horse was at a temporary stable," police said. After the accident, the family shifted the second horse too. 
 
 Around 11pm, nearly 100 locals reached Mailardevpally police station. They feared the rider would be let off. The locals alleged many families in the area were bringing horses on to the road and causing inconvenience. The youth was booked under section 304-A (causing death by rash and negligent act) of the IPC.
