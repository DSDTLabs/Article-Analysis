GHAZIABAD: You could bypass the heavy   traffic and reach   bridge from UP Gate in a few minutes as early as June if the   manages to keep its promise of opening the first section of the Hindon   by then.

 The 4km section of the elevated road between UP Gate and Kanawani bridge is likely to be opened by the end of May, a senior   official told TOI on Monday. 
 
 Work on the stretch has been progressing fast and all 116 pillars required to support the span have been built. Currently, exit ramps from the elevated road to the   are under construction.
 
 In effect, though, the stretch will cater to only one-way traffic — from UP Gate, towards Ghaziabad — till the rest of the 10.3km elevated road up to Raj Nagar Extension is completed. Vehicles from Indirapuram coming towards UP Gate may also not be able to use this stretch till the exit plan on to NH-24 is worked out.
 
 “There is a plan to partially open the section to vehicles on a trial basis after completion of the ramps,” the senior GDA officer said. “Only one-way movement of vehicles on a single carriageway will be permitted. During peak traffic hours in the morning, vehicles can ascend from the ramp on the Vasundhara side to travel towards Delhi. Similarly, vehicles can be allowed to travel in the reverse direction during the evening. The plan is, however, subject to approval following consultations between GDA and the traffic department.”
 
 The median verge of the elevated road will have gaps at a distance of 2 km, which will be closed with the help of concrete barriers. These barriers can be removed in case of an emergency to facilitate movement of vehicles in the reverse direction.
