Coimbatore: PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Sunday called for a through probe into all appointments to the Bharathiar University in the past 15 years.  Talking to reporters here on Sunday on the sidelines of a party function in Sulur, Ramadoss said, “The vice-chancellor has been arrested now. But irregularities had been happening for years.”  “Vice-chancellor aspirants bribe their way to the post and then commit irregularities to recover the bribe money they had paid. Bribery at the top seeps down to the bottom. Ministers in the state government too have a role in corruption in universities. So, a CBI inquiry should be ordered and all appointments made in the past 15 years should be probed,” he added.
