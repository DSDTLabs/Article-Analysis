PUNE: In a bid to boost research in engineering and postdoctoral research, the College of   ( ) is all set to get an additional   located in Nigdi Pradhikaran.

 With the proposal in the last stages of finalisation by the government, the college will have an extension in Pradhikaran with grant of additional 40-acre government land. Once the proposal is cleared, the campus will be ready in ten years.
 
 The divisional commissioner’s office has confirmed that the proposal has been put before the commissioner. Government grazing land in   (PCNTDA) will be allotted for the purpose. 
 
 “Three meetings were held under the chairmanship of the divisional commissioner to clear the proposal and forward the same to the government. The proposal is up for some clearances from the government after which the land will be handed over to COEP,” stated an official from the divisional commissioner’s office. As the land is being handed over to a government college, the rate quoted is negligible, the official added. 
 
 CoEP director BB Ahuja confirmed the proposal for an extended campus and said that once the land is granted, detailed planning regarding academic structure would be done. Ahuja said, “Once the college is granted university status there would be a bigger need to expand. Moreover, most of our buildings are heritage structures so there is very little scope to expand in the present campus.” 
 
 Ahuja added that the proposal was submitted a long time ago and the management was waiting for government approval to undertake further planning. “We might think of introducing several specialised and allied courses in the extended campus,” he said.
 
 While the cost of land would be nominal, institute officials have also readied a budget of Rs 10 crore to develop the land. The budget has also been shared with several alumni based in India and abroad in an effort to seek donation.
