LUDHIANA: An 82-year-old debt-ridden farmer ended his life at a village in Payal on Wednesday evening. This is the second suicide by a farmer in Payal in less than 10 days.

 The deceased was identified as   Singh of Chankiyaan Khurd. Police officials said his son had died in 2014 and he had two grandsons. Joginder had taken a loan of Rs 5 lakh from two banks and due to losses in farming, he sold three of his 10 acres. His family members said he remained upset because of the debt.
 
 The family told the police that Joginder went to meet his daughter in a Doraha village and after returning from there, he told his grandson that he has consumed poison. Parminder Singh, his grandson, said they rushed him to a private hospital in Doraha and when his condition worsened, doctors referred him to a Ludhiana hospital, but he died on the way.
 
 Payal DSP Rashpal Singh Dhindsa said Joginder’s family told that he was upset because of debt.
 
 The police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC.
 
 Leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira visited the family on Thursday.
 
 Khaira said, “I condemn chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s approach towards farmers’ debt waiver. There has been a spurt in farmer suicides. Since the   government came to power in Punjab, 365 farmers have committed suicide so far, as per media reports.”
 
 Holding the CM at fault, he added, “Amarinder Singh had vowed to waive their debts. But after taking over the state reins, he is running away from his promise because of which farmers have lost all hope. He is responsible for their taking the extreme step.”
 
 Another debt death
 
 On February 28, 42-year-old Jaspal Singh, a farmer who was under a debt of Rs 20 lakh, had ended his life by consuming poison at his house in Ramgarh Sardaran, Payal. The police had booked financier Devinder Singh of   village for abetment to suicide. In a suicide note, Jaspal had alleged that Devinder was harassing him for money.
