PANAJI: Goa may have to wait a little longer for its new state   president, as AICC president   is currently travelling through Karnataka to drum up support and votes for his party in the upcoming Karnataka assembly elections. Party sources told TOI that the all India Congress Committee’s (AICC) central committee is yet to formally discuss the names shortlisted for the post of Goa Congress president. 

 Interestingly, party members, including senior leaders, state that the selection of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) president could have an impact on the current BJP-led coalition government over the next two months. “This is an unstable government,” said outgoing president Shantaram Naik. “In such a situation, the next PCC president has to see what can be done for the structure of the government, which is already shaky.” 
 
 The Karnataka assembly elections will be held on May 12. The Gandhi scion is expected to meet with Goa desk in-charge A Chella Kumar and other close advisors after the political rallies in Karnataka wind up.
 
 Six names have been recommended for the post of GPCC president, but party insiders say that AICC secretary and Panaji by-election candidate Girish Chodankar and   MLA Digambar Kamat are the frontrunners. The party is also deliberating whether to appoint a veteran Congress leader or a younger face, in sync with Gandhi’s vision.
 
 Congress workers, especially the MLAs, have rallied behind Kamat, who has better acceptability within the party and across party lines. Chella Kumar is said to be in favour of Chodankar, but Congress MLAs appear to be staunchly opposed to such a move. “I am ready to work and assist any person who is elected as president,” Chodankar said on Wednesday. “It is not so much that a young leader has to be elected, but someone whose thought process is progressive and who is young at heart,” he said.
