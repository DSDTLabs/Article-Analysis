Pune: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) wants Air Deccan, set to start operations from Solapur, to change its Mumbai flight schedule to daytime. 

 This comes ahead of the second round of bidding for the unserved and under-served airports and airstrips as part of the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) in August. 
 
 “The Air Deccan from Solapur to Mumbai is scheduled ar 5:30pm. The 70-seater flight will reach Solapur at 4:35pm from the first week of September. Many people, particularly from the business community, in Solapur have been seeking a change in the timing. They say the timing will not be beneficial for their businesses. The AAI has got several letters. We will hold a discussion with Air Deccan in August and request them to change the schedule,” Solapur airport director Santosh Kaulke told TOI.
 
 The official said they have so far not held any across-the-table meeting with Air Deccan on the flight operations. All attempts made to contact Air Deccan proved futile with a senior official not responding to phone calls or text messages. The Solapur airport is managed by AAI. 
 
 On the other hand, TruJet, which started its flights to Hyderabad from Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji Airport in Nanded on April 27, said their Mumbai operation was expected to start by August 20 but was stuck for nearly four months because of “operational problems”.
 
 Senthil Raja, head (commercial) of the airlines, said, “We have taken care of the problems and we expect the flight from Nanded to Mumbai will start by August. The flight will leave Nanded at 10:30am.”
 
 The official said the aircraft for Mumbai was going through a maintenance check. At present, TruJet has four aircraft.
