BHUBANESWAR: The police on Friday registered cases against 52 people for punishing and humiliating a man in   in   because his wife, a ward member, had voted against the village committee choice's of naib sarpanch in February. 

 The village panel had on Wednesday slapped a fine on Dushmanta Sahu for his wife, Mallika's, 'mistake'. After he expressed his inability to pay, the panel on Thursday forced him to make rounds of the village by beating a gong and apologizing.
 
 The dispute had begun soon after the panchayat polls in February. Police said the village committee had decided to support a particular candidate as naib sarpanch and had requested Mallika to vote for him. But she chose to vote for a different candidate who eventually won, prompting the irate villagers to ostracize the family.
 
 Unwilling to let go, the committee members met again on Wednesday and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the family. "When I expressed my inability to pay up, they said I have to go around the village, beat a gong and seek mercy from villagers. This is sheer humiliation but I had to follow the order," Dushmanta said.
 
 "We have taken suo motu cognizance of the incident and booked 52 persons of Ragudiapada, including village committee members Hemant Garnaik and Jyotiranjan Acharya. Dushmanta also lodged a complaint against 14 people of his village. Investigation is on," said Angul SP Brijesh Kumar Rai.
 
 Angul collector Anil Kumar Samal has ordered an administrative probe into the matter. 
 
 The BJP, meanwhile, staged a dharna in front of the collector's office on Friday and sought action against the people involved. The party also filed a petition before the Odisha Human Rights Commission. Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan expressed concern over the incident. "It is unfortunate and unacceptable," he tweeted.
