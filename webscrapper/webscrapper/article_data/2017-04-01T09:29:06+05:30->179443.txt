HYDERABAD: The AP   (APERC) on Friday approved an overall 3-6 per cent hike in   the 2017-18 fiscal. The hike will come into effect from Saturday. 

 Consumers will now have to pay an extra 800 crore. A close scrutiny of the ERC tariff order bares another shocker: An additional 887 crore "pending true-up" burden will also have to be borne by the consumers. Power sector experts see a higher burden as the tariff is calculated in telescopic structure now. All those who have an average monthly consumption of over 200 units (category C) will have to shell out more. 
 
 For example, those who consume more than 225 units a month will have to pay a much higher tariff now. "The burden is estimated at around 800 crore. We have effected no hike on low-consuming categories thereby giving relief to a large number of consumers. We have not accepted the proposal to levy fixed charges on domestic consumers," said Justice  , chairman of APERC. Around 15.47 lakh agriculture farmers will continue to get free power for seven hours a day. The government, on the other hand, agreed to pay 3,700 crore towards subsidy to power discoms, which is 400 more than the previous year. With a whopping deficit of 8,065 crore, the discoms will still struggle as the estimated revenue through the latest tariff hike will only be to the tune of 800 crore. 
 
 Aqua culture, animal husbandry, poultry hatcheries, poultry feed mixing plants, sugarcane crushing, mushroom, rabbit farms, floriculture in green houses and religious places will have to pay 3 to 3.6 per cent higher for power consumption.
