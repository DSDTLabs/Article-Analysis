It is a known fact that Ganesh’s wife   and   are close friends, and Shilpa was the one who helped Amulya find her husband-to-be — Jagadish. It is no surprise, then, that Shilpa is hosting Amulya’s mehendi bash at her place. “We will have a mehendi bash where some of our close friends will be invited. This will be held on May 10. Following this, on May 11, we leave to Adichunchungiri; May 12 is my wedding ceremony, which will be held in the midst of a close gathering,” says Amulya. 
Over the past couple of weeks, Amulya and her family have been personally inviting all industry colleagues personally. “We plan on hosting a small party on May 14, when we are back after the ceremony, while we will host a reception on May 16 for the entire film industry, friends and family,” adds the actress.
