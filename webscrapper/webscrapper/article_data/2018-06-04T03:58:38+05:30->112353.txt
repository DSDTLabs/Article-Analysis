NEW DELHI: Former   chief minister   on Sunday announced he was embarking on a six to eight months yatra (travel) across all assembly constituencies in the state to highlight the shortcomings of the present Manohar Lal   government. Hooda said he won’t rest until the “anti-people government is voted out”.

 
 “ The arrogance of the   government is even more than Ravana. They had made 154 promises to the people but four years later, this government has not fulfilled even one promise,” the former CM said.
 
 The   leader’s outreach plan comes at a time when he is facing corruption charges. The yatra has been planned to regain support to challenge the ruling BJP in next year’s assembly polls. “My slogan is ‘Janta ko jagaana aur sarkar ko bhagaana’ (make people aware to vote out the government),” Hooda told TOI.
