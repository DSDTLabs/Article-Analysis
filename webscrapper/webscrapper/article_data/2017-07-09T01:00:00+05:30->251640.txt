Patna:   (PU) has directed the heads of postgraduate (PG) departments and the principals of colleges to make their respective campuses clean before the beginning of the new academic session.

 In a circular issued on Friday, PU pro-VC Dolly Sinha pointed out that posters and banners of political parties and coaching institutes are displayed prominently on the main gates and walls of colleges. This spreads the wrong message among the new students. “Such posters should be replaced with new ones highlighting issues related to the menace of ragging, conservation of environment, digital India, health and sanitation, prohibition, GST and consumer protection. The campus should be declared tobacco and plastic-free zones,” the circular says.
 
 Colleges have also been asked to set up admission help desks where shortlisted candidates are properly guided and helped in selecting the right combination of subjects. Appropriate arrangements should be made to sort out any problem faced by the newcomers and induction meets conducted before their classes begin so that they are aware of various rules and regulations. Student-teacher-parent meets should also be organized within one month of the commencement of classes.
 
 Colleges and departments will also set up soft-skill development centres as well as anti-ragging, counselling and placement cells for career development. They will also ensure availability of safe drinking water and clean toilets for students on the campus. The heads of institutions have been directed to submit action taken report within two months of the commencement of classes.
