 The iconic eighteenth-century story by Robert Louis Stevenson about a young Jim Hawkins and his seafaring adventures has been adapted for stage. Directed for the stage by Vikash Khurana, this is a play for kids that uses a mix of music and humour to tell the story of the innkeeper’s son Jim and his exploits on the high seas.
 
 The play starts off with an interaction that establishes the setting and introduces some of the major characters, including Jim Hawkins, the wise physician Dr Livesey and Billy Bones, who kick-starts the narrative by unearthing the map to the secret treasure. Given that there are multiple characters and a complex story, Vikash has adapted it for stage quite efficiently. You get to see all the juicy scenes that are essential to the story including the mutiny, the final search for the treasure and the interaction between the crazy Ben Gunn and Jim Hawkins. Onkar Ghare as Ben gives a fun performance that makes sure the kids are in splits. Another interesting thing is the way the actors make use of the aisle area in the theatre and use it extensively in the scenes. This exercise, in a way, involves the audience in the play and keeps them hooked on to the action.
 
 Amol Wakhare does a credible job as Jim and keeps you engrossed as he transforms, from a curious boy to a steadfast young man. However, it is the humour that really does the trick for this play. While the production and set-up is minimal, this tale of action, deceit and adventure will easily keep your young one’s interest piqued until its entire run-time.
