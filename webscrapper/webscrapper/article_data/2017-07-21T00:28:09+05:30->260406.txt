Chandigarh: Panjab University has decided to follow the   guidelines for admissions as defined by the ministry of human resource and development (MHRD). This was decided in the first meeting of the fee committee of the PU and its affiliated colleges held here on Thursday. 

 Sources said that it was decided that the decision for the implementation of new NRI guidelines would be looked into. They said that the new admission guidelines for NRI students, which were ratified by the PU governing bodies, would be done away with and the NRI norms as per the MHRD guidelines would be followed. It was discussed in the meeting that the university would lose a major chunk of income if the admissions happen following the new NRI guidelines for admissions. 
 
 According to the NRI guidelines ratified by the PU syndicate on January 21, children of persons of Indian origin (who may or may not be citizen of countries other than India) or of overseas citizens of India can fall under the NRI category, provided they have resided in a country other than India for a minimum period of three years immediately preceding the year of admission. 
 
 The guidelines also stated that those candidates who are citizens of countries other than India and hold the passport of that country and overseas citizens of India are also entitled to get admission under the NRI category. Besides, students whose parents or father is not alive at the time of admission can be treated as wards of their grandparents, who are of Indian origin (who may or may not be citizens of countries other than India) or overseas citizens of India, provided the grandchildren have resided in a country other than India for a minimum period of three years immediately preceding the year of admission.
 
 Meanwhile, as many as 42 NRI students of the total 225 foreign students were enrolled in the University for Different Courses for the 2016-17 academic session.
