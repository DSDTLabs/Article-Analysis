MUMBAI:  , the   president, who now ceases to be one following the  's order on Monday, sarcastically said: “(Supreme Court feels) the BCCI can do better under retired judges. I wish them all the best.”

 This came soon after the country's highest court announced that Thakur, along with BCCI secretary  , would not be able to transact any business on behalf of the BCCI.
 
 Thakur and Shirke had been at the forefront of BCCI's struggle to defy the SC orders that mandated implementation of the Lodha Committee recommendations. The defiance had led to a long-standing impasse between the board and the committee. The committee blamed Thakur and Shirke for the resistance.
 
 “For me, it was not a personal battle. It was a battle for the autonomy of the sports body. I respect Supreme Court as any citizen should. My commitment to Indian cricket and autonomy of sports will always remain,” Thakur said.
 
 Both Thakur and Shirke maintain that BCCI is not everything in life for them. Thakur has national and Himachal Pradesh state politics to look into while Shirke has flourishing family and individual businesses in India and overseas to take care of.
 
 “This does not affect me at all. I will go back to run my business,” Shirke said while Thakur came up with a statement: “I had the honour of serving Indian cricket. Over the years, Indian cricket saw its very best in terms of administration and development of the game. BCCI is the best-managed sports organisation in the country, with defined procedures. India has the best cricket infrastructure, built and maintained by the state associations with the help of BCCI. India has more quality players than anywhere in the world.”
