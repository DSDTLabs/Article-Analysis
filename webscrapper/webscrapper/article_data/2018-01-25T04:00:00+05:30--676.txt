Surat: There is some bad news for the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat from the US. 

 In its latest report, US-based Jewellers Board of Trade (JBT) has reported that jewellery industry in the US continues to downsize with some 1,022 jewellery companies shutting down businesses in 2017. JBT listed a total of 27,286 North American jewellery businesses in its database,  ,563 retailers,  ,988 wholesalers and 2,735 manufacturers. The number of listing fell 4 per cent from the previous year’s 28,309 jewellery businesses. In 2014, around 770 jewellery businesses shut down followed by 929 in 2015 and 1,564 in 2016 as per JBT.
 
 According to JBT, there are a number of factors contributing to this continuing trend of jewellery businesses shutting down in the US, but the main one is succession. Many business owners are reaching retirement age and don’t have children who are interested in continuing the family business. 
 
 US is the world’s largest diamond jewellery consumer market with over $32 billion in annual sales out of the total $80 billion in the world. 
 
 In the first 11 months of 2017, US’s polished diamond trade slowed imports down 6 per cent at $20.14 billion. By volume, polished imports dropped 5 percent to 11.125 million carats, while the average price of the imports rose 1 per cent to $2,076 per carat, according to provisional US government data. 
 
 As per the official figures from the GJEPC, India’s 45 per cent of the polished diamond exports is bound to the US. The annual export of diamonds to the US is pegged at over $8 billion. 
 
 “Most of the exporters in Surat and Mumbai have been targeting US in 2017. Out of the $80 billion worth of world’s diamond jewellery market, US commands over $35 billion. The yearly imports of polished diamond is between $20 billion and $25 billion in the US. India is looking for a bigger share this year, but the closure of jewellery businesses has subdued the business sentiments in India,” regional chairman, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), Dinesh Navadiya said.
 
 Navdaiya added, “The low-cost jewellery is trending in the US from the past many years. Surat is processing low-cost diamonds, including Melee and Star qualities, to suit the consumer demand in the US.”
 
 A diamond exporter Kirti Shah said, “Every year, around 700 to 800 jewellery businesses in the US is shutting shops. It is either due to the financial troubles, the jewellery businesses in the US are downsizing every year. This is quite worrying for diamantaires in Surat as US is the largest market for cut and polished diamonds.”
