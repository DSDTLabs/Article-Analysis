Surat: Devotees from the areas located near the airport performed garba outside the terminal building when they were not allowed to perform puja at a small temple (mata ki deri) situated in the corner of the runway here on Friday. 

 Sources said people from Magdalla and Bhimpore villages have been following the tradition of performing puja at ‘mata ki deri’ inside the airport terminal for many decades during the eighth day of Navratri. The villagers had gone for the puja at the ‘deri’ on Thursday, but were not allowed to enter the terminal building by the airport staff. 
 
 The villagers then again went to the airport on Friday to perform religious rites at the temple. They were not allowed inside the airport premises and made to sit outside for more than two hours. After that, they were allowed entry into the airport premises, but prevented from entering the terminal building. 
 
 The angry villagers started garba outside the terminal building as a mark of protest against the airport authorities. 
 
 Airport director Dilip Sajnani said, “We value the religious feelings of the villagers. For years, the villagers have been performing puja at ‘mata ki deri’ near the runway. They were allowed for all these years because there was a single flight in operation. Now, we have 18 flights and the entry to the runway has been totally restricted. We are maintaining the temple well since it is there since many decades. But allowing the devotees on the runway is prohibited.”
