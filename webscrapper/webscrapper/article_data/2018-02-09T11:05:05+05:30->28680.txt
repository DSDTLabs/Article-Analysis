PUNE: The city police on Thursday decided to seal a lodge near Mandai, off  , for operating a prostitution racket.

 It will be the first lodge to be sealed for running a sex racket. City police commissioner   has issued an order to this effect.
 
 Senior inspector   of the Social Security Cell (SSC) said, “The police prepared a proposal to seal the lodge because repeated cases of flesh trade under the provisions of the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act were registered with the Vishrambaug police since 2015. This will be the first action against any lodge in the city.”
 
 In 2017, the Pune police conducted raids on lodges at Satara Road, Lohegaon, Wagholi, Mundhwa, Koregaon Park,   and three five-star hotels in the city. “In all, we have filed nine cases against the lodge or hotel operators,” he said.
 
 “The police came to know that the lodge operator of Mandai was operating as a flesh trade agent. Thus, it was decided to take stern action against the lodge owner,” Patil said.
 
 “Generally, women on their own visit the lodges or their customers book the rooms,” Patil said, adding that the lodge owners or managers never came in the picture directly.
 
 In 2017, the city SSC sealed 29 brothels in the Budhwar Peth’s red light area. “On Tuesday night, the SSC officials raided a lodge at Rasta Peth. The lodge owner,   (29), and his manager   (26), both residents of Rasta Peth, had kept two women in a room of the lodge. The suspects used to solicit the lodge customers to see these women,” Patil said.
 
 The police rescued a woman (22) from Kolkata and another from Odisha from their clutches. “This turned out to be the second case, where the lodge owner was directly involved in the flesh trade racket,” Patil said.
