RAJKOT: A lesser known right-wing outfit in Jamnagar has issued a brazen threat to murder lawyers and their families who defend the two arrested ISIS suspects in the court. 

 On Tuesday, Pratik Bhatt, who calls himself the Gujarat president of Hindu Sena, issued an open threat to lawyer Imtiyaz Koreja in Jamnagar. 
 
 "All advocates have refused to defend the ISIS terrorists. But a lawyer named Imtiyaz has shown his willingness to fight their case. But Hindu Sena openly threatens to eliminate Imtiyaz and his entire family (if he goes ahead to be become the defence counsel). Imtiyaz would be alone responsible for his life. We urge lawyers to refrain from defending the accused otherwise Hindu Sena will counter them," Bhatt said in Jamnagar.
 
 Earlier on Monday, the Rajkot Bar Association had adopted a resolution that none of its members would defend two terror suspects Waseem Ramodiya and his brother Naeem and declared their support to state police. Jamnagar Bar Association followed suit on Tuesday.
 
 Bhatt even threatened to set Imtiyaz's house ablaze. Bhatt even issued a press note regarding the threat. Despite such a brazen threat, the Jamnagar's B-division police only detained Bhatt and released him after sometime. Sources said that the outfit has barely any local standing too and Bhatt, an advocate himself, is close to Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal. Imtiyaz could not be contacted despite several attempts.
