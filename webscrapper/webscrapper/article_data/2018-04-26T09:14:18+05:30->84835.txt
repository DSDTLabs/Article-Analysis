We want to tell people that the waste generated by them every day can be converted into good quality manure and the burden on the civic body to process the waste can be reduced to a large extent. During the first year, we collected more than 22 tonnes of plastic waste and submitted it for recycling. The decentralisation of the waste processing can help reduce concerns of garbage menace to a large extent."
