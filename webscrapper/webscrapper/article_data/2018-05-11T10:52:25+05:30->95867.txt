Mollywood's latest campus movie   is packed with actors. It has  , Tony Luke, Shabareesh Varma, Aditi Ravi and Gayathri Suresh to name a few. 

 Beautifully shot and brightly lit, Naam is an engaging campus drama. Till the intermission, the film focuses on establishing the characters who are all part of a first year gang and their varied personas. 
 
 As of now, there is no compelling plotline that makes you wonder what's next, but credit to the director for making it an easy watch that isn't too boring. On the flip side, the first year boys and girls, except a few, don't look like teenagers at all. However, that has not hampered the fun quotient much.
 
 Tony Luke plays a mysterious youth named Aju while Noby appears as the funny Kunchacko in the movie. Renji Panicker plays Fr James and Saiju Kurup, a campus resident named Mastan.  ' guest role holds the storyline together.
