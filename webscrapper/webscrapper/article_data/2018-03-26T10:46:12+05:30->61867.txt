 General secretary of HRF K Sudha said that even after 50 years of Kanchickacherla Kotesu incident, nothing has changed in the state. 
 
 Atrocities and violence against dalits continue unabated even today, for which Garagaparru and Pedagottipadu incidents stand as vindication to this phenomenon.
 
 She took objection to the recent judgment by the  , which has stated that the SC/ST Atrocities Prevention Act is being misused and the accused will be arrested only after conducting preliminary enquiry and establishing prima facie. This judgement is a gross injustice by the top court in the country, she asserted.

He lashed out at TDP government for isolating Pedagottipadu village after dalits were attacked by the people belonging to upper castes. J Jaya Bhagyamma from Pedagottipadu said Dalits in the village continue to suffer even after three months of the incident.
