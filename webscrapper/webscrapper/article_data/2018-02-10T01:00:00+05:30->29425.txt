 Vanita Malhotra, who attended the car rally, said, "Seeing such beautiful cars maintained so well, is really a delight. I took a round of the ground on Umama's Austin 1930 and it was so much fun." Members of the club, Tariq Ibrahim, Vivek Nigam, Dr Nita Jain, Yasser, Wasia, Leena and TS Johar, were busy sharing details of their prized possessions with people who attended the show. After a long time, Dr AS Prasad was also seen at the show. 
 We also spotted Zaara riding an old paratrooper scooter during the show. "This scooter is really very small. The owner of this scooter told me that this scooter was used by paratroopers. They used to jump from planes with these scooters and used to use these small scooters for travelling in enemy territory."
