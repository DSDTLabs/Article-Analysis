CHANDIGARH : To ensure supply of good quality of fruits and vegetables, the   state cooperative apex bank has launched two schemes to provide loans to cooperative societies of vegetables and fruit growers, and women cooperative societies. 

 Minister of state for cooperation   said the upper limit of the loan would be Rs 5 lakh or 10 times the share capital of the societies. The societies would not have to deposit security for loans up to Rs 5 lakh. The minister added that loans, which would also ensure economic growth of women, could be taken against guarantee of two responsible persons of the village or town. 
 
 The district central cooperative banks would disburse the loan amount of Rs 5 lakh, while the state government would contribute a subsidy of Rs 1 lakh or 20% of the loan, considering the lesser value. 
 
 Grover said the scheme for provision of loans to the societies has been devised such that the farmers in the state could avail various incentives offered by the government and other related agencies from time-to-time in the form of subsidies and grants. He added that both schemes have been prepared as per the announcement made by chief minister   and would be implemented through all district central cooperative banks across the state.
