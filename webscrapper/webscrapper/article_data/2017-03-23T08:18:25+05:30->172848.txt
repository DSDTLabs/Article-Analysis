CHENNAI: With Neduvasal villagers remaining firm against hydrocarbon exploration and extraction project,   working president M K Stalin on Wednesday demanded that the   government pass a resolution in the legislative assembly, urging the Union government to give up its plan. 

 Intervening in the debate, the DMK leader sought to convey that the   government at the Centre had not spelt out its final decision on the issue. "There is no firm announcement from the Centre still. The members of the struggle committee continue to meet me, and demand a special resolution be moved in the assembly," Stalin said. 
 
 Given that just two more days are left for the ongoing session, he said the government should consider adopting a resolution against the Centre's move, similar to the jallikattu resolution passed in the assembly in January.
 
 Earlier, DMK MLA (Alangudi) Siva V Meyanathan moved a calling attention motion, stating that the hard work of farmers turned barren land of   region into gold mine after several decades. 
 
 The free supply of power also helped the peasantry, and several crops like paddy and plantain were raised in huge acreage. "But, the   has left 50,000 farmers in the lurch. There is fear that the project will lead to severe drinking water crisis," he said, demanding that the state offer Rs 10 lakh as financial aid to the family of Ponnammal, the villager, who died during the agitation.
