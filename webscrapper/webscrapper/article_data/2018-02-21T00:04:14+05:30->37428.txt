MUMBAI:   line commuters may able to take trains up to   as the commissioner of railway safety (CRS) has approved   at a speed not exceeding 100kmph.

 After years of delay, the corridor’s extension up to Goregaon was scheduled to open for commuters by December 2017. The date was revised to January but minor work led to a delay. There are 91 services between CST-Andheri.   plans to extend all Andheri services to Goregaon.
 
 Sources said, “Commissioner of railway safety Suresh Chandra inspected the line. WR authorities ran the train with a speed restriction of 100kmph. The trials passed smoothly and CRS signed the approval letter, which is on its way to WR.”
 
 A senior WR official said, “The route can be opened any time once the letter lands on our desk. We can start by running token services in a few days after permission, but it may take time if all Andheri services are to be extended to Goregaon.”
 
 Officials said they can run full-fledged services not before March 1 as they need to train crew about spotting signals and speed restriction spots along the route. The crew link preparation will also take time, he added. There are 65 services operating between Churchgate and Andheri. Since the path is available beyond Andheri, it is better to run even WR main line trains up to Goregaon, he added. It also plans to shift almost 50% of the Churchgate-Andheri services up to Goregaon.
