PUNE: The Hinjewadi police on Monday arrested two men and booked another two for allegedly blackmailing and repeatedly raping a 25-year-old woman working with a private housekeeping company.

 Senior inspector Arun Waykar of the Hinjewadi police said Jiten alias   (20) of Assam and   (35) of Kushinagar in   have been arrested.
 
 According to the FIR, the woman was in need of money, for which she contacted Turiya. “Promising to help her out, he took the woman to a room in Bavdhan and raped her. Next day, he took her to an apartment in Katraj and raped her again before giving her the money,” the FIR stated.
 
 Turiya, however, clicked some pictures of the woman in a compromising position and used them to blackmail her. “Later, Turiya he and his associates started blackmailing the woman and raped her repeatedly in the forest areas of Katraj, Bavdhan and Marunji,” police said.
 
 Frustrated with the harassment, the woman told her husband, who asked her to approach the police. “The woman as well as the suspects are school drop outs,” police said.
