Actor   says his daughter does not watch popular sitcom "Friends" because he is in it.
 
  The 49-year-old actor shot to fame playing Joey Tribbiani in the sitcom, and though his 12-year-old daughter Marina's friends have been watching reruns of the series, she has no interest in it as she does not want to "overdose" on seeing her dad.
  
  
 
  
  "I don't think she thinks I'm too cool. I think her friends at school are watching 'Friends' now, that's about the age they get into it, but she, she can't be bothered. She just couldn't care less. She's seen it, but it's her dad.
  
  "She sees me enough...She's like, 'Overdose on my dad, I don't want that," LeBlanc said on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show".
