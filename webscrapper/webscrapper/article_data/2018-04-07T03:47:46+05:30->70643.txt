This infuriated me and I thrashed him twice and pushed him to the corner of the auto so that he couldn't escape," Jangra told TOI . 
 
 Although the constable struggled to escape, Jangra, with the help of the autorickshaw driver, managed to drag him to the nearest women's police station.

 The promising sportsperson and her father were taken aback when the SHO tried to mediate instead of filing their complaint, telling them that the constable's career and married life would be marred if an FIR was registered.
