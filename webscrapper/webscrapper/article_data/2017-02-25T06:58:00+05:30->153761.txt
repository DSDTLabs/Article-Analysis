NOIDA: The latest advisory from the   that makes school managements and heads of the schools accountable for any lapse on the part of the   in following the Supreme Court’s guidelines has evoked a guarded reaction from the principals of Noida schools.

 While most principals have welcomed the advisory, issued on Thursday, which makes the guidelines an “integral part” of school affiliation bylaws, they said that making principals accountable for any lapse would be “unfair”. Some said that it was the transporters who should be held accountable for any lapse or in case of an untoward incident.
 
 However, parents have welcomed the step, saying that holding the school management accountable will ensure better compliance.
 
 Niti Shrivastava, president of the GB Nagar Parents’ Association, told TOI that making the school management accountable for flouting of any guidelines by the school buses was a good move as it would ensure that the schools did not take children’s safety lightly.
 
 Principals said that schools would now be talking to transporters for making changes in the speed limit of speed governors, etc.
 
 However, some principals called it “unfair”, saying that their fraternity should have been taken into confidence before formulating any such directive.
 
 “We welcome the advisory but I don’t think the school management should be held responsible for anything wrong done by the driver/conductor on road,” said Jasweer Singh, vice-principal, Kothari International School, Sector 50.
 
 Along with mandatory installation of CCTV cameras and GPS device inside the school buses, the guidelines said that speed governors be restricted at a speed of 40kmph.
 
 Some principals expressed reservations against this saying that it might not be a practical proposition for the buses plying the   and those covering longer routes within Greater Noida or from Greater Noida to Noida.
