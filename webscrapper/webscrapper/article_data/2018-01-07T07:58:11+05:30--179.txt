CHANDIGARH: As the sitting mayor of Chandigarh Asha   filed her nomination paper as an independent candidate for the mayor’s seat against BJP’s official candidate   and then, openly denied to withdraw the same, TOI correspondent   spoke to   national vice president and incharge of Chandigarh and   affairs   about the party’s fate in the city, issues that led to the rebellion within the party and other related aspects.

 
 
 A |  , definitely whatever has happened has dented the party largely. For the ruling party, any such thing is really painful and should not happen, because people have huge amount of faith on you.
 
 
 
 
 A | I strongly feel that there are two things in the politics, one is self-decision and another is organisation’s decision. There is huge a difference between the both. One should always understand that the organisation’s decision is more vital than self-decisions in politics.
 
 
 
 
 A | If there is any infighting, it should remain within the party and should not come out in the open ever. When you are a ruling party, public look towards you with huge aspirations, faith and the same should not be broken at any cost.
 
 
 
 
 A | It is completely my failure. Nobody else is responsible for it. I feel that I might have some weaknesses in me due to which I failed to keep everybody together, despite my best efforts. I will ponder over it and do self-assessment.
 
 
 
 
 A | I strongly feel that everything will be resolved and we will contest the mayoral polls together. Everybody is wise and by contesting the polls together, party will move towards the preparation of 2019 parliamentary elections.
 
 
 
 A | I personally look forward to 2019, which is crucial for us and therefore, people’s faith should not be broken at any cost. Public chooses us on the basis of faith and it should be maintained.
