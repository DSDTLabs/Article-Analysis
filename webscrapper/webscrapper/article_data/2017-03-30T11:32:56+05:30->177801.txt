NAGPUR: Taking note of TOI report, the NMC’s   on Wednesday initiated a drive to catch   on Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT) campus and trapped three female dogs. These strays would be operated under ABC programme and vaccinated before being released. 

 NMC veterinary officer   said around 15 pups were trapped but they couldn’t take them to animal shelter as they were only five months old and can’t be put under the knife. “We need to wait for another month to conduct ABC operation on them. It is an open area so the squad had difficulty in catching stray dogs. The drive will continue for another 5 or 6 days,” he said. 
 
 Mahalle said the decision was taken on Monday but the exercise couldn’t be carried out on Tuesday because of holiday. 
 
 On March 27, TOI had reported about the stray menace and that around 10 morning walkers were bitten by the canines in the last 15 days.
 
 The   had started bringing sticks to protect themselves during their morning excursions. The fear among morning walkers had also resulted in killing of one dog.
