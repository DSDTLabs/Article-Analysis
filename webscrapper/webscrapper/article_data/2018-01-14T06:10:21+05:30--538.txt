KOLKATA: The civic body’s ambitious water supply augmentation scheme may fall flat in near future as it is struggling to find a solution to the sedimentation problem at two of its major plants —   and Garden Reach.

 The Palta water treatment plant, which has a capacity to produce 240 million gallons every day, has failed to reach its optimum level due to lack of dredging of its water beds. The one at Garden Reach is aslo suffering from siltation woes.
 
 If   fails to tackle the problem before summer sets in, areas like Bidhan Sarani, College Street, Narkeldanga, Beliaghata, Park Circus, Picnic Garden, Garden Reach, Behala, Jadavpur and   will be the worst-affected.
 
 At Palta waterworks, there is a large water tank that serves as the reservoir for raw water that is drawn from the Hooghly through the intake jetty. The water is then passed on to two waterbeds to go through a slow sand filtration process. Both the tanks and a couple of waterbeds used as filter beds, are lying heavily silted.
 
  
  
 The principal tank needs immediate dredging as the water bearing capacity of the tank is getting gradually reduced with the deposition of 12,00,000 cubic metre of silt over past two decades.
 
 The KMC water supply department needs to lift 45,000 cubic metre of earth — or silt — every three years from these filter beds.
 
 Till five years ago, the task of desilting was not a problem with the brickfield owners buying the earth as raw material. “Earlier, there were many brickfields in   area. Now, with the decline of the industry, we are desperately looking for buyers. This has made the situation complex at Palta. The same can be said for Garden Reach water treatment plant,” a KMC water supply department official said. “The matter has been conveyed to mayor   for a quick solution,” he added.
