NEW DELHI: This match is the stuff of legend and the outcome could not have come on a better day than March 15, the 124th anniversary of the first ever official Test match. India down 0-1 in 2000-01 three-match Test series, bowled out for 171 in reply to Australia's 445 in the second Test, forced to follow on ... and then it all turned very, very special. The hero for India was  , whose 83-ball 59 from No. 6 inspired the move to send him in at No. 3 when India batted a second time on the third day. 

 Laxman finished the day not out on 109 and with   (180) batted the entire fourth day while adding 335; the eventual stand of 376 broke a series of records and took India to 589 for 4. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Laxman batted his way to a marathon 281, the highest Test score by an Indian and one that changed the tone of the match. Sourav Ganguly's declaration with a lead of 383 set Australia 75 overs to bat out a draw;   Ã± whose first-innings 7 for 123 on day one included the first hat-trick by an Indian in Tests had other ideas and took six wickets to bowl India to an epic win. 16 years on, the victory is still afresh in minds of those who witnessed the Eden miracle and cricket lovers across the globe. 
 
 Today also marks the 140th anniversary of the first ever official Test match that was played between England and Australia at the MCG in 1877. Google dedicated a Doodle to celebrate anniversary. The first official cricket Test match in history began on this day in 1877 between an established English team and a newly-formed Australian squad at the Melbourne Cricket ground. It finished in a 45-run win for Australia. 
 
  
  
 
 "Today's Doodle hits the deck with a light-hearted rendering that captures the spirit of sportsmanship and the inaugural Test match," Google said.
 
 "Mustachioed and muscle-bound, the batsmen, bowlers and opposition fielders spring into action, never losing sight of the red ball," it said.
