GURUGRAM: State finance minister   on Saturday asked   developers to clear outstanding external development charges (EDCs) and play a proactive role in mitigating problems facing the sector.

 The minister, who was in   in the day to attend convention Invest Haryana, said EDCs to the tune of Rs 17,000 crore was pending across Haryana. Almost 90% of which is outstanding in Gurgaon and Faridabad region alone, and if cleared, the amount could be used for infrastructure development in this part of the state.
 
 “Gurgaon is struggling with bad infrastructure, like potholed roads, etc, due to fund crunch. If these dues are paid, it will boost the state exchequer. I promise that the government will spend the amount on infrastructure development in Gurgaon and Faridabad itself,” said Singh. 
 
 Singh made the comments while responding to a couple of developers who spoke about their expectations from the Haryana government. Around 300 delegates from the real estate sector were present at the convention.
 
 Allaying fears regarding the Real Estate Regulation (Rera) Act, the minister said the government would safeguard the interests of buyers. The town and country planning department of Haryana has already circulated the draft   rules, inviting suggestions from all stakeholders. The government has let off most ongoing housing projects, which have been delayed and remain a worry for many home buyers, in the draft rules. 
 
 “We have to come up with an Act that helps the industry but, at the same time, does not go against the consumer interests. The government is focused to come up with a balanced Act,” he said.
