Actor   and filmmaker Major Ravi’s partnership have been such that they had gone on to make films such as Keerthi Chakra, Kurukshetra and Kandahar, fostering a nationalistic fervour among the audience. The actor will be seen reprising the role of Major Mahadevan in their latest venture  , which is all set to release in April 7. 

 The official trailer was out recently, and it looks like they are at it again, as the characters are clothed in sheer patriotism. It is a peep into Major Mahadevan’s endeavours on the war front, and how he and his team manage to encounter rivals with utmost dedication. 
 
 The film also has Hindi actor Arunodhay Singh, Asha Sharath, Allu Sirish, Renji Panicker and Sudheer Karamana, among many others.
