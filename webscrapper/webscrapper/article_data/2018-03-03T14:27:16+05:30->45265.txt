In his teal double-button kurta sherwani and patola scarf, Umang Hutheesing, master craftsman and scion of Ahmedabad’s   family, looked very elegant as he sat down for the chat. “Kurtas are informal and sherwanis are too formal. So I made this for myself,” he said. As   began the conversation in Ek Mulakat — an initiative by  , in association with Shree Cement, Tollygunge Club and   — the audience discovered a new meaning of fashion. 
“I don’t call myself a fashion designer. I did not invent sari or bandhgala. I realised, it is far more important to preserve living heritage,” said Umang, who is among the very few Indian designers to have created clothes for Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II, Bill Clinton and many other statesmen all over the world. “But you have never marketed your creation well. Why?,” asked Moon Moon to which he replied, “I am always bad at calculation. And if I calculate, when shall 
 I create?”
  
  
 The members of the audience were in awe of his philosophy of life.  , the man behind the initiative, said, “Umang is a friend and for a long time I wanted him to come to Kolkata and talk to people here. I wanted him to let them know about his work, exposure and above all, his thought process.” Tolly Club CEO and managing member, Anil Mukerji, said, “For me tonight’s talk was a journey into the sartorial heritage of India.”
