BENGALURU:  , the Corporation Bank staffer who was attacked by a man at an ATM kiosk in November 2013, is hoping her assailant, arrested three years later, won't escape from jail. "Prison officials must make sure he doesn't give them a slip and escape again," said Jyothi on Friday. Undergoing treatment for months, she is yet to get over the trauma. Every since that fateful day, Jyothi hasn't visited an ATM alone. 

 The suspect, Madhukar Reddy, had been convicted of murder and escaped from an   jail. He was on the lam when he attacked Jyothi at the kiosk. Jyothi and her husband Uday Kumar didn't believe their ears when they first heard about AP police detaining her suspected attacker. "We called media colleagues to confirm the news. Somehow, we had a strange feeling that he was the one who was behind the attack," they said. 
 
  Asked whether Jyothi is ready for the identification parade, she said: "Yes. I want to make sure he is behind bars and is punished."
