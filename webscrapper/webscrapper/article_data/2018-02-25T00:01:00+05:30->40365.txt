 who has enthralled the audience as the sensuous   in 
  will now be replaced by   who will be known as Jhuma boudi. “I have no clue that I am replacing Swastika as I heard that this is a new season of Dupur Thakurpo which will have a new face and that’s me. Every actor has its own place and no one replaces anyone. I don’t know what has happened between Swastika and the production house. I was approached as it is a new season where I will add on to the character in my own way and I am sure the audience will get to see something new. And needless to say I have high regards for Swastika as an actress,” said Sreelekha.

  
 Swastika Mukherjee on her part said, “I can’t come to mutually agreeable terms with TV Mediawala , producer of the show, so I am opting out.”
