BELAGAVI: Besides ensuring the maintenance of law and order at the stations,   in the district appear to be saddled with yet another responsibility –   of unidentified bodies. While railway police in Belagavi handled the cremation of as many as 30 bodies in 2016, the number was higher in ’15 – 38. They have also presided over the cremation of three   in 2017.

 For the cops, one of the increasing worries is the number of suicide cases on the   in the past few years. Sources said that of the 80 incidents of death recorded on railway tracks and platforms in 2016, suicide accounted for 36 of them. As many as 24 suicide cases have been reported in 2017, as on July 12, besides 13 accident cases.
 
 Shankar, a constable at the Belagavi railway police station, said, “A police team always visits the accident spot, and the first thing we do is send the body to postmortem. If we find any evidence about the identity of the deceased, we immediately inform his or her relatives, and the body is handed over to them. It’s when we get no information about the identity, that we face a problem. We place advertisements in the paper, and inform all police stations. But, if there’s no response within two days, we take the body for cremation.”
 
 Railway police officials, accompanied by personnel from the Belagavi City Corporation, take these unidentified bodies to the Rukmini Nagar Crematorium and the Anagol Crematorium, where the final rites are performed, sources added.
 
 BT Walikar, inspector at the railway police station, said that they always tried to ascertain the identity of the deceased, and contact their kin. “Sometimes, it’s hard to identify the deceased if they have been left very badly injured by the train. Since the body starts to decay after three days, we take it for cremation. It’s become a duty for us,” added Walikar.
