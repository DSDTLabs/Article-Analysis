Purulia: The Bharat Bandh called as part of nationwide protests against the Supreme Court’s verdict diluting provisions of the SC-ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act saw its fallout in Dalit-dominated Purulia with protesters blocking three points on two national highways — the Dhanbad-Jamshedpur NH-32 and NH-60A. 

 In Kolkata, too, around 650 Dalits marched from Park Circus to Science City, snarling traffic for nearly two hours.
 
 Men and women marched along the highways with portraits of B R Ambedkar and blocked the Dulmi, Gosala and Raghavpur crossings. The blockade began after the higher secondary exam for the day got under way. The traffic came to a standtill for about an hour and 45 minutes, affecting movement between Bengal and Jharkhand as well as other states.
 
 Ananda Bauri, who led the Bauri Samaj-organised protest, said: “Though we joined the Bharat Bandh, we curtailed the duration of blockades to avoid harassing higher secondary examinees.”
