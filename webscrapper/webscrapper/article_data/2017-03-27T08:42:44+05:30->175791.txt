You’ve probably seen this a dozen times in movies. A girl and boy (strangers, mind you) make conversation at a table for two, until a buzzer sounds and they move to new tables, where other participants (again, strangers) await their company. Whether they meet again or not, is entirely up to them. But by the end of the evening, they will be somewhat acquainted with at least five others from the opposite sex, having just participated in what is a very popular way for singles the world over to meet new people - speed dating. In India, the concept surfaced (not necessarily thrived, as a quick online search will reveal) more than 10 years ago and was quickly forgotten when young Indians discovered the joys of meeting new people at the swipe of a thumb. So imagine our surprise when Pune girl Sukanya Raman and her friend told us they recently attended a   session in the city and are looking forward to the next.
 
 
 
  “We accidentally discovered the event online. Having heard about the concept from our friends in other countries, we decided to give it a try. I prefer this to   any day, because when you’re with someone face to face, you can make better judgements,” says Sukanya, 25, who finds online dating uninteresting. Among the many participants of the event, organised by a Bengaluru-based group who are reintroducing the concept across Indian cities, was Sakshi Sharma*, the MD of a city-based educational institute. Though she left a tad disappointed (her dates were either too young or too boring), Sakshi, 32, would consider speed dating again, if the organisers could promise better company (sorry Sakshi, we’re certain they can’t).
  Investment banker Randeep Sarkar*, who was also there out of curiosity, says that most of the people he met at the event shared a common disinterest in online dating. Though he did not find someone to go on a second date with, by the end of the session, Randeep, 40, says he made some new friends. “So this is not just about finding a partner. Besides, speed dating can also be a reality check to see what kind of impression you can make in a few minutes,” he adds. But of course, to each his own and dermatologist Abhigyan Mukherjee, also a participant, felt that a few minutes was just not enough time to get to know the other person. “Yes, there were instances where five minutes was more than enough time with a person, but otherwise, eight minutes is not enough time to get to know your date,” insists 26-year-old Abhigyan.
 
  
 
 
  As expected, the ‘eight minutes per date’ time frame was not the only aspect of the event that drew divided opinions. The price tag of Rs.4,000 per participant was also a topic of debate. “I thought the pricing was ok. But some people might be disappointed if they pay Rs.4,000 and don’t meet anyone interesting,” feels Abhigyan, while Sakshi says that even taking the venue (  in Yerwada) and the complimentary welcome drink into consideration, she would pay no more than Rs.1,500. Price tags and precious minutes aside, our burning question, is why after three (considerably successful) events in the city and a fourth coming up on March 31, the organisers are yet to plan something for the homosexual community. “We are definitely open to organising sessions for same-sex singles as well. But we have not been approached by anyone as yet. When we find enough participants showing interest, we’ll take it forward,” assures Vijay, one of the five members behind Bengaluru-based  , that has organised 32 speed dating sessions in five cities, since last September.
  
  
 
  With its face-to-face advantage and nearly 20 new people signing up for each session, there’s no questioning that the concept of speed dating is finding plenty of takers in the city. But does that imply that it has an edge over its online counterparts? Before you answer that question, we suggest taking into consideration what   regulars have to say. Media student Indrani Bose* for instance, agrees that meeting face-to-face is organic and has a certain appeal. But it is in no way safer or better than meeting online. “I wouldn’t speed date because it seems frivolous and is not the best way to get to know somebody. It’s a game and validates a cliché that a first impression is the last impression. Some people take time to open up. And I’ve met very interesting people on   who are now good friends,” shares the 23-year-old who has been using dating apps for over a year and a half. And addressing the opinion that meeting face-to-face is safer,   another city-based student in her twenties, asks, “So what if the organisers of speed dating sessions are vetting participants? The second date after they introduce us is not in their control and can go horribly wrong. So I’m practically taking the same risks that I would be taking online.” 
  Now, we’re not trying to be suggestive, but here’s a parting thought for your penny. Speed dating, that was started by a Jewish Rabbi to introduce single Jews to each other, now also comes in an online version, where participants are introduced in video chat rooms.
  
  
 
  
 
 
  * You sign up online and provide the organisers with details about yourself (including a proof of identity), which will be kept anonymous
  * Participate in the session and let the organisers know which of your ‘dates’ you would like to meet again
  * If the other person has also expressed interest in you, the two of you will receive each other’s contact details via email
  * If you don’t have a single match at the end of the session, better luck next time
