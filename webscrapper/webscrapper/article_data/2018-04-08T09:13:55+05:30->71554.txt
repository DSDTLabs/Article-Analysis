CHENNAI:The Chennai   along with   Catering and Tourism Corporation ( ), set up a counter at the Chennai Central station to sell rail coach models, toys, coffee mugs, key-chains and coffee table books on Friday.

 The store is located at the entrance of railway station, so that people do not need a platform ticket to access it. The models are priced between Rs 700 and Rs 5,000 per model, said a senior railway official.
 
 Southern Railway general manager R K Kulshrestha on Friday visited the stall, which will also function as a tourism information centre for passengers, where staffers will provide information about tourist spots across Tamil Nadu. 
 
 Sources said the counter was created after a visit to the Central station by Ashwani Lohani, chairman of Railway Board, who insisted on the initiative. 
 
 Railway models are already being sold at the Chennai Rail Museum, which is run by the   (ICF) on New Avadi Road, but this counter will be accessed by a larger number of people, said a source. 
 
 Around 10 to 15 models were sold on the inaugural day. It has been a hit with children, said an official. 
 
 Sources say models of railway engines, especially vintage steam ones, might also be sold at the centre, as they are in demand at the railway museum in New Delhi.
 
 Special train tours have been designed for leave travel concession (LTC) clients to destinations this summer to beat the heat, an official said. 
 
 The packages can be booked online on the IRCTC website (www.irctctourism.com).
