NEW DELHI:   of Maharishi Valmiki Hospital were killed early on Friday after their two-wheeler rammed into a truck parked on the   of the road at Bengali Chowk in outer Delhi’s Bawana. However, police have not ruled out the possibility of a third vehicle’s involvement — it might have hit the victim’s two-wheeler causing it to crash into the truck.

 Police are in a tizzy because they have not located any CCTV footage in the vicinity of the accident spot. A regular commuter on the route where the accident took place told the cops that while returning home late on Thursday night, he had come across a crowd near his house and found two men lying in a pool of blood there. He said the accident had apparently happened some minutes before he reached the place.
 
 The person phoned the police control room, and the police took the two men, identified as chief medical officer Rajesh Rajput (32) and junior resident Gurfan (27), doctors of Maharishi Valmiki Hospital, for medical treatment, but they were dead by then.
 
 Police said the duo lived in the hospital quarters and were on their way home from work. “The two were riding a Scooty when they collided with a truck that was parked on the wrong side of the road,” a senior police officer said. “There was no one inside the truck when the police team reached the spot. We have started investigations to identify the driver and owner of the truck.”
 
 According to police, the sequence of the collision is still to be established. They said it was possible that the two riders did not anticipate the truck because it was wrongly parked on the road. It could also be that the truck suddenly braked, resulting in the accident. A third possibility was that the Scooty was hit by another vehicle, causing it to careen into the truck.
 
 Rajput had married a year ago, while Gurfan was a bachelor. Their colleagues remembered them as jolly and kindly men. They said that the two had planned to visit a colleague on his birthday on Saturday.
