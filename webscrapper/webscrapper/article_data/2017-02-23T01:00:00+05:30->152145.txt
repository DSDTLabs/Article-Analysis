Growing veggies, spices and herbs on terraces is a trend fast picking up in Noida. The idea is quite a rage with not just senior citizens and housewives, but working professionals too. Noidawallahas had a great time showing off their huge variety of flowers and plants, including anti-smog plants, medicinal herbs and seasonal flowers, at a terrace garden competition organised recently by the Floriculture Society of Noida. These gardens were judged on the basis of the selection of plants, choice of colours, ambience, layout and utility of the garden. We visit some of these terrace gardens in the city:
