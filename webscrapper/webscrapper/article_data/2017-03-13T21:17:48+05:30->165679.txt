 has the potential to become new treatment of choice for an estimated 1.5 million women worldwide who undergo IVF or infertility treatment each year.
 
 A new study, published in   medical journal, involved over 1,000 women across 38 international sites and found that oral dydrogesterone had similar efficacy and tolerability to micronized vaginal progesterone (MVP), which is commonly used across the globe to prepare the uterus lining for pregnancy. 
  
 IVF is one of several methods of assisted reproduction technology in which a fertilized embryo is transferred to the woman’s uterus. Progesterone or a related hormone, such as dydrogesterone, is used in IVF to prepare the lining of the uterus (luteal phase support) to allow a fertilized egg to implant.
  
 It is estimated that 10% of the married couples in India suffer from some form of infertility but around 1% of them seek treatment such as IVF. "MVP is the most commonly used method of administering progesterone in IVF centers globally, but is associated with side-effects, such as irritation and discharge, as well as poor patient acceptance,'' said a press release sent by Abbott, which conducted the Lotus I study published in Human Reproduction. 
  
 In effect, Lotus I found that oral dydrogesterone is similarly well-tolerated and efficacious compared to MVP.
  
 "The findings from this study have the potential to have important implications for women undergoing IVF," said Herman Tournaye, director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Universitair Ziekenhuis, Brussel, and lead clinical researcher for the Lotus I study. "We found oral dydrogesterone to be effective, well tolerated and easy to administer – all of which point to it becoming the new preferred treatment option."
