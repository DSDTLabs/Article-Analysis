NEW DELHI: Most people do not think that bag   is a major crime or a dangerous one. However, while it may not by itself present a threat to life like, say a physical assault or an armed robbery, resisting a snatching can have horrible repercussions. Take Sharmila Rai. For nine months now, she has not been able to speak a single word or get off her bed.

 Rai’s life fell apart when some bikers snatched her bag on Moolchand flyover on December 30 last year. She held on, but was jerked out the autorickshaw she was travelling on and suffered severe head injuries. Her husband, Rakesh, told TOI that he had to then ask Sharmila’s parents to move in since someone had to take constant care of the bedridden woman.
 
 “She has been undertaking speech therapy, but nothing has worked till date,” said Rakesh. “It is so difficult to see my wife in this condition. We don’t even know if the bag snatchers were caught and punished.”
 
 It has been a similar ordeal for 21-year-old Mahak Bakshi. She had to leave her job to nurse her mother, Jyoti, back to health. Jyoti, like Sharmila, was injured when resisting the bag snatchers from inside an autorickshaw near Red Fort on August 28. A few days after the incident, the cops nabbed two youths at Kashmere Gate area and recovered the 55-year-old woman’s bag. “The violent modus operandi adopted by these snatchers calls for very harsh punishment. The   suffers for the rest of her life, but the criminals don’t get punishment they deserve,” said Mahak.
 
 Simi too has been left traumatised for life after snatchers targeted her near AIIMS in July. She now calls a cab even if she has only a short distance to travel. “I did not suffer much since I somehow managed to control my fall and the auto driver had slowed down,” said Simi. “These men need to be punished because they ignore the fact that while snatching a phone or a purse, they can also ruin lives.”
