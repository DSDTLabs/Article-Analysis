Coimbatore: The city police on Monday arrested two men on charges of murdering a 60-year-old man for refusing to transfer his 1.75 cents of land to their names on January 25. The duo was remanded in judicial custody. 

 The arrested were identified as A Krishnamurthy, 31, of Saravana Nagar at Sundarapuram, and S Ganeshan, 24, of Kuniyamuthur. Krishnamurthy was engaged with secondhand motorcycle sales and Ganeshan was engaged with scrap business.
 
 On January 25, 60-year-old ragpicker R Chinnasamy of MGR Nagar Extension at Sundarapuram was found dead. His body was found tied to a chair. He was strangled to death. 
 
 Police investigation revealed that Chinnasamy was residing in his own house constructed on 1.75 cents of land. Krishnamurthy and Ganeshan were residing in rental houses and decided to grab the house from Chinnasamy. So, the duo had gone to Chinnasamyâ€™s house and consumed liquor along with him. Later, they demanded him to transfer the 1.75 cents of land to their names but he refused.
 
 Subsequently, they tied him to a chair and bet him. Chinnasamy still refused to transfer the land to them. Finally, the duo strangled Chinnasamy to death and abandoned the body in the house. 
 
 A few days later, bad smell emanated from the house and the locals informed Podanur (law and order) police who registered a case and arrested the duo. They were lodged at the Coimbatore central prison on Monday evening. Chinnasamy was residing alone as his wife had separated from him 20 years ago.
