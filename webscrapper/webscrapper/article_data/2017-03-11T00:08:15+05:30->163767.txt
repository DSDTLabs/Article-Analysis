NAVI MUMBAI: After almost two months of hardship, green category industries in   got a breather from the steep 40 per cent   imposed since January 14. 

  (MPCB) instructed MIDC to restore 100% supply to 521 units. The rest will continue to face cut (see box) or, will lose their water connection, if proven to be non-compliant of state pollution board norms.
 
 The offending units are allegedly violating   and releasing untreated waste in the nearby water bodies and creek.
 
 “A list of compliant units was submitted and MPCB member secretary, Dr P Anbalagan, issued an order, asking MIDC to restore full supply to industries that are not adding to the pollution level in Taloja industrial corridor. We are happy that MPCB will supply the full quota to the green industries,” said Satish Shetty, president of Taloja Industries Association.
 
 The entrepreneurs had a meeting recently with member secretary of MPCB to discuss problems faced by the non-polluting units due to the water cut. 
 
 However, despite several rounds of talk, no specific data was available with the agencies to segregate the compliant and non-compliant units. 
 
 “Before restoration of water supply, we will have to disconnect the lines of polluting units. We are waiting for that list from MPCB,” said S V Raoot, deputy engineer, MIDC. 
 
 MPCB sub-regional officer, Satish Padwal said the list of polluting units will be submitted to MIDC soon.
 
 Some non-compliant units have also alleged that the poorly maintained common effluent treatment plant (CETP) is releasing non-treated industrial waste into water bodies. 
 
 “We will meet MPCB officials to suggest that MIDC take over the upkeep of the CETP,” said Shetty.
