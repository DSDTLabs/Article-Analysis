LUCNOW: Reacting to the bribery allegations against sacked executive member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Maulana Salman Husaini Nadwi, Art of Living (AoL) founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar said on Thursday that the cleric made no such demand during his interaction with him last week. 

 Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Nirman Nyas general secretary Amarnath   had on Thursday filed a police complaint against Nadwi alleging that he demanded Rs 5,000 crore, 200 acres of land and a   seat for helping in settling the   dispute out of court. The complaint has not been turned into an FIR so far. 
 
 “Some people seem to be working to derail and discredit the dialogue process,” Sri Sri said in a statement. “We will probe the genuineness of his (Mishra’s) complaint. As far as our interaction with Maulana Nadwi is concerned, there were no such demands,” he added. Speaking on behalf of Sri Sri, AoL director Gautam Vig said no team had been set up for settlement of Ayodhya dispute. 
 
 “Gurudev speaks to the stakeholders... anyone willing to participate is welcome,” he said.While attempts to contact Nadwi failed, he told a news channel on Thursday, “Some people are creating controversies... This is mischief since my views have drawn support from 90% Muslims and Hindus.”
