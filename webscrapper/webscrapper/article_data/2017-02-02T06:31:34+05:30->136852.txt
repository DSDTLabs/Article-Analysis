 DMK working president and leader of the opposition in the assembly M K Stalin, who moved the Madras high court seeking a judicial probe into police excesses on pro-jallikattu demonstrators on January 23, withdrew the plea as the state government had already constituted a judicial commission headed by exjudge of the court Justice S Rajeswaran.The PIL had to be withdrawn as the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice M Sundar was not inclined to entertain it. Giving liberty to Stalin to challenge the terms of reference of the Rajeswaran Commission, the bench said: “ As the state government has constituted a commission of inquiry headed by the retired judge of the high court after the filing of the writ petition, the petitioner may be permitted to withdraw this writ petition with liberty to approach this court as and when required with regard to the issue relating to the police excess and terms of the reference of the inquiry commission.“
 
 Earlier, P Wilson, senior counsel for Stalin, submitted that a   (SIT) comprising officials drawn from CBI and NIA, besides medical professionals, should be formed to hold a comprehensive inquiry into police excesses. Wilson played video clippings of protests on the laptop in the open court.
 
 Responding to this, the first bench said it was up to the petitioner to produce before the commission of inquiry all material available.
 
 The bench said it could not entertain the PIL at this stage, and said that besides appointing a judicial commission, the chief minister had issued a statement that action would be taken against erring police officials if the charges prove to be true.
