AHMEDABAD: How much parking space has the builder revealed to the municipal corporation for BU permissions for an upcoming apartment or commercial block, and how much has it been revealed to a prospective buyer? The   (AMC) has a tried to bridge this “information gap” and now have begun uploading all parking plans, for all multi-storied buildings on its website. To eliminate errors the   has even uploaded the photographs of building when the BU permission was issued to the builder.

 Right now information and parking plans are being uploaded for 262 buildings.
 
 The parking information can be accessed on the main   under the dropdown menu of Public Information option. “The dropdown menu has town development option where all parking details are being currently uploaded. The website has a list of names of buildings, their addresses, area approved for two and four-wheeler parking as well as area for visitors parking,” says a senior town development officer (TDO).
 
 Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar says, “Prospective buyers of properties or those who are currently residing in multi-storied apartments or use commercial buildings will exactly know the parking space allowed in these buildings when building permissions were issued. We want to empower citizens with this information so that they can demand their rightful space and inform us if there are any discrepancies.” Commercial complexes induce huge traffic, increase parking demand and congestion in the neighbourhood
 
 A senior official also pointed out that currently AMC is opening up its unused plots for parking space. “We have one pay-and-park facility behind Kargil petrol pump in Gota area and the other one in Sarkhej ward. This is an experiment which will help AMC prevent encroachment of its open plots. Also such utilisation can free up road space on arterial roads or commercial roads,” said Kumar.
