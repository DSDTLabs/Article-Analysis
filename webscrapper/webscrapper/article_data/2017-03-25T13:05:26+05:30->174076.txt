Porvorim: Chief minister  , while presenting the annual state budget on Friday, announced that his government intended to carry on with the on-going nation-wide drive to make the economy as much cashless as possible. 

 “The government will encourage digital payments and make it financially rewarding. I propose to formulate an appropriate policy in order to discourage cash transactions,” Parrikar said, adding that the government would be strengthening the state’s IT infrastructure to permeate high-speed broadband connectivity to every corner of Goa in the next two years. 
 
 Following the decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, the then defence minister had envisaged Goa as the first state in India to become a cashless society. He had set a deadline of December 31, 2016, to achieve the target.
 
 “ Goa will be the first to become a cashless society in India. We have to support the Prime Minister’s dream,” Parrikar had said in November, adding that one can do anything once he/she has registered her/his mobile number with a bank under the central government unified payment interference (UPI).
 
 Following Parrikar’s statement, the state’s commercial tax department had also issued a trade circular in the official gazette, urging all the registered vendors, hoteliers and dealers to encourage  .
 
 Parrikar’s announcement back then was met by a backlash, with the Goa Bank Employees’ Association, and the   (AIBEA) stating that adopting a cashless economy was not possible in a state like Goa.
 
 Former chief minister   had then clarified Parrikar’s remarks, saying that the government was looking at less cash transactions, not cashless transactions.
