MUMBAI: The Ganesh mandals of   have been fined Rs 12 lakh by the   for causing potholes on roads. The civic body has found hundreds of potholes in this area alone.

 Every year, the BMC undertakes large-scale road repairs before Ganesh festival. This year too, repairs were undertaken and 20 per cent of the civic body’s imported pothole mix was reserved for filling pits dug up for the Ganpati festival.
 
 Year after year, the Ganesh Mandals create potholes on roads year after year. According to rules, every mandal is supposed to keep its roads or footpaths in a good shape. The mandals are expected to fill potholes themselves.
 
 The pits are created while erecting pandals.
 
 It has been observed that none of the Mandals restores the roads or footpaths to their original condition and hence the BMC imposes fines on them. If they refuse to pay up in time, the BMC levies interest on it.
 
 This year, the Mandals in Parel alone will be made to cough up Rs 12 lakh for the pits they created. At Rs 4.86 lakh,   has to pay the largest share of the fine as the mandal left 243 potholes behind.
 
 Ganesh Gullycha Raja has been fined Rs 4.14 lakh for 207 potholes.
 
 The other mandals have also not escaped scrutiny, although the fine is much lower.
 
 Kalachowkie’s Bal Ganesh Mandal has been asked to pay Rs 32,000, Parelcha Raja will have to pay Rs 42,000, while Chinchpoklicha Raja has been fined Rs 68,000.
 
 Together, the amount stands at Rs 12.94 lakh
 
 “We fine these mandals every year but they avoid coughing up the money. Many have to pay dues pending for five years now,” said a BMC official.
