KOLKATA: If you are wondering that there could not have been a more inconvenient start to the week with the   choking the entire central and south Kolkata and virtually bringing a big part of the city to a halt on a hot and humid day, brace yourself for more trouble this week. While the Left Front has called for a protest meeting at central Kolkata on Tuesday evening, SUCI (Communist) has also given a call for Nabanna march a day later on Wednesday. On Thursday, the BJP state leadership has called for a Lalbazar march. 

 Police said they will make similar arrangements even for Thursday, when BJP state president   has promised that lakhs will be on the roads to protest the police excesses on its supporters. "As of now, we do know that they are planning at least three rallies from College Street, Esplanade and Howrah station towards Lalbazar. If that happens it will be central Kolkata and a significant part of north Kolkata that will be hit," said an officer.
 
 Traffic police, though, could not promise that all this arrangements can ensure a chaos-free commute in the days ahead. "Most of the protests here are taking place at the heart of the city. Any minor disruption causes chaos that can last up to a couple of hours. We would ask commuters to check with traffic department for latest updates before they start from their houses," said an officer at Lalbazar.
 
 The police strategy on Monday was to push in as many men as possible at as many as 18 strategic points so that the Left supporters could not sneak through the barricades. "The fact that three different barricades were brought down and yet none could get on to the approach of the Vidyasagar Setu is proof enough that our bandobast was massive," said police.
