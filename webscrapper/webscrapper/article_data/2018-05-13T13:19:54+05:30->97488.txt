  : Leader of Opposition   took a dig at chief minister   on Saturday over Union minister  's letter. In her letter, Bharti has charged that an officer close to her was not considered for promotion due to his proximity. 

 Singh said the move has exposed rampant nepotism and favouritism under the present dispensation in the promotion and posting of civil servants.
 
 Singh further said that the letter has not only exposed the functioning of Chouhan's dispensation but has also demoralised more than six lakh officials and employees of the state government.
 
  Singh said Bharti's letter would strengthen the belief that without political clout, a civil servant could not go up the ladder and hard work and honesty hardly played any role in deciding promotion or posting of officials. tnn
