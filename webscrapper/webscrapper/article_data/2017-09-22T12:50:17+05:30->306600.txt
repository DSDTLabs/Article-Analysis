MYSURU: Expressing concern over the delay in appointment of   to various state universities, the Forum of Former Vice-Chancellors of Karnataka State Universities (FVCK) has urged the government to expedite the process lest the academic activities at these varsities be adversely impacted.

 Former VC of the   (UoM) Sn Hegde on Wednesday pointed out that nearly half of the government universities in Karnataka were currently helmed by in-charge VCs. “They do not have the power to take important decisions, and the situation at these universities is deteriorating with each day. The government must step in.”
 
 Hegde opined that the state government must refrain from opening   at a time when it was struggling to run the existing ones. “While few universities don’t have autonomy, others are facing financial problems, staff shortage, etc. The government must act now to save the students,” the former UoM VC added. He said that the primary objective of FVCK was to ensure that students received quality education in state universities.
 
 Hegde bemoaned the fact that, despite being considered among the best universities in the state, UoM was suffering owing to the absence of a full-time VC. “Research and other academic activities have been badly affected as a result. In such a backdrop, it’s not prudent to establish new universities,” he added. 
 
 Upset that the government had announced setting up of Rajkumar and Vishwakarma universities without holding proper consultations, Hegde said, “The existing universities are facing a crisis, and the higher education department has failed to run them properly. University is not just a building.”
 
 Former VCs of Kuvempu University, Shivamogga VC Venkataramaiah, Karnataka university, Dharwad M Mahadevappa echoed Hegde’s concerns.
