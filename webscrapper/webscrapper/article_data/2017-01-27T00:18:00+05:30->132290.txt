BHOPAL: State Congress president   on Wednesday demanded an unconditional apology from BJP leader Vinay Katiyar for his sexist “prettier campaigners” than   remark. “Vinay Katiyar is the BJP’s uncontrolled loose political canon. The kind of indecent language he used against Priyanka Gandhi shows the venomous character of the BJP and the RSS,” Arun Yadav said on Wednesday afternoon.

 The PCC chief is irked with Priyanka Gandhi’s comparison to Union minister for textiles Smriti Irani and the other “actresses” that Katiyar said were equally efficient crowd pullers.
 
 “Priyanka Gandhi is the daughter of a family, which has repeatedly sacrificed its members for the nation. To compare her with ‘nachne-gaane wali (singers and dancers)’ is an insult to that family, which actively participated and led the country’s freedom movement,” Yadav said. “Katiyar should tender an unconditional apology for his remark against Priyanka Gandhi.”
 
 State Congress chief spokesman KK Mishra argued that Vinay Katiyar who founded the   has access to grassroots information about the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. “He has information about the BJP’s condition in the five states going to the polls. Making an offensive comment on Priyanka Gandhi is only his way of expressing concern for his own party’s likely debacle in the five states. Katiyar and the BJP are unnerved,” Mishra said.
 
 The Congress spokesman added that Katiyar’s statement is a pre-conceived political attack and not a spontaneous attack. “But Vinay Katiyar with his vile attacks can never touch the heights of Priyanka Gandhi,” Mishra said.
