PALAKKAD: Taking serious note of   denying Kerala its share of water from Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (PAP), chairman of the state administrative reforms committee V S   on Saturday urged chief minister   to intervene in the matter.

 Achuthanandan asked Vijayan to meet his Tamil Nadu counterpart O Pannerselvam and apprise the latter of the acute water shortage and get water released to Chittur from PAP.
 
 In a statement the veteran Marxist leader said the denial of   had resulted in the destruction of paddy in 8000 hectares.
 
 “Kerala should have received 19.25 TMC feet water under the PAP agreement at Manacadavu weir from Aliyar and Sholayar dams. But it received only one fourth of its due share. Tamil Nadu is diverting the PAP water for irrigation and power generation, while denying Kerala even the drinking water,” the former chief minister said in a statement.
 
 Despite an alarming depletion of ground water in Kanjikode, Pepsi Cola has been exploiting ground water in huge quantity, Achuthanandan said. The high court has allowed the soft drink giant to draw 6.5 lakh litres of water daily.
 
 “The state government should immediately approach the high court and get this order cancelled considering the alarming depletion of ground watert,” the statement said. tnn
