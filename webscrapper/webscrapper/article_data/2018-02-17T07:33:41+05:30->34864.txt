BHOPAL: Barkatullah   non-teaching employees ended their month-long strike on Friday after serving an ultimatum that a failure to concede their demands by March would force them to lock the campus. The employees ended the strike after assurance from the university authorities.

 Madhya Pradesh University Non-teaching Employees’   warned if the government failed to accept the demand university campuses across the state would face lockout. Association general secretary Lakhan Singh   said enough time has been given to authorities.
 
 
 “We have shown enough parience. This is the last deadline,” said Parmar. The sssociation has been demanding regularisation of contingency employees and others. Perhaps in a bid to avoid any row or trouble during convocation on February 24, the   authorities on Thursday assured protesting non-teaching staff to accept their demands. BU employees threatened to join the state association strike again if nothing changes by March.
 
 “Few proposals have been considered. In this regard, declaration will be announced in next three days,” stated university official. However, employees said they will end their month-long strike only after discussing demands accepted by the university on Friday. Their chief demand is regularisation of contingency employees. “The Governor has sent a letter to the higher education department. It is expected to be declared by March 24,” said a university official.
 
 The demands, among other things include implementation of the seventh pay commission and contingency fund payment of Rs 1,000 every month. However, the university has refused to entertain this demand citing there is no such rule to disburse the amount.
 
 Employees also demanded continuation of 6% and 20% allowance. In this regard, the university said it would be done after a report from audit.
