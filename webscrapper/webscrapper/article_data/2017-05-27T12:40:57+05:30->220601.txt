MOTIHARI: Nine undertrial prisoners facing charges of murder, loot, kidnapping and extortion were on Friday transferred from Motihari Central Jail to Bhagalpur and   under tight security by the jail administration. 

 Police sources said these criminals were running extortion business from behind the bar and two of them - Rahul Singh and Chhotai Singh - were involved in the murder of Bablu Dubey, a gangster, who was killed on Bettiah court premises recently.
 
 However, Motihari Central Jail superintendent Manoj Kumar said the undertrial prisoners were shifted due to administrative reasons. While Rahul Singh, Vikash Singh, Pawan Singh, Maujelal Sahani and Chhotai Singh were transferred to Bhagalpur jail, Krishna Giri, Rajan Sahani, Laxmi Singh and Umesh Sahani were sent to Gaya jail.
