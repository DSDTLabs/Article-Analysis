MUMBAI: It was most apt that the coldest January day in four years at 11.9 degree Celsius fell on Thursday, two days before Makar Sankranti. The warmth of the   bonfire, the blessings of til laddoos and the fragrant aroma of sweet pongal rice could not have come at a better time.

 Friday ushers a series of winter harvest festivals beginning with Lohri January 13 and going on to Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Maghi Bihu January 14. Each of these acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the sun god for his sustenance.
 
 Housing societies particularly in Sion Koliwada, GTB Nagar, Bandra, Khar and Andheri will light the Lohri bonfire Friday night. "People circumambulate the fire and make harvest offerings like revdi and popcorn as well as coconut. Lohri is not a religious festival but one that the entire Punjabi community celebrates," said Sardar Himmat Singh, secretary of the Dashmesh Darbar Gurdwara in GTB Nagar.
 
 The festival of Makar Sankranti marks Uttarayan or the entry of the sun into Capricorn. "Maharashtrians prepare brown hard til laddoos with jaggery. We Sindhis make soft malleable laddoos with white sesame, gulkand, rose petals, raisins and pistachio nuts," said Andheri housewife Bhagwanti Rai.
 
 She purchased a half kg box for Rs 140 on Thursday. Sindhis traditionally offer a meal of sweet saffron rice, sai bhaji, radish, carrot and til sweets to a group of little girls this day.
 
 This year the favourite motif on Sankranti kites features PM Modi amid a cache of demonetised currency as well as the new Rs 2,000 notes. "But business is bad. I hope the promise of achhe din does not turn out to be an exercise in kite flying," laughed Sharad Sane who sells kites near Crawford Market.
 
 Saturday morning, Tamilian households will cook the delectable pongal rice using rice, milk, sugarcane, jaggery and cardamom. The women of Dharavi line up scores of pots on the lengthy strip of road to prepare a collective feast.
