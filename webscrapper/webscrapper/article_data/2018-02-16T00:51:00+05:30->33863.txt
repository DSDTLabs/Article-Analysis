Kolkata:  , the birth place of St Mother Teresa, is keen to invest in West Bengal and hoping to strengthen its trade ties with the state. 

 Namit Bajoria, honorary consul general of the Republic of Macedonia, pointed out that the east European nation is working hard for not only having cultural ties with Bengal but also to identify and create business opportunities between the two nations . 
 
 “I have been able to convince through the presence of my ambassador for the first time to look forward for partnering as a country for next year,” Bajoria said.
 
 Toni Atanasovski, ambassador to The Republic of Macedonia in India, was present at the BGBS Summit 2018 last month. According to Bajoria, Aanasovski was impressed with the opportunities in the state. 
 
 “The BGBS 2018 which was held from 15-17 January 2018 has proven to be an excellent platform for fostering relations between many foreign countries, including Macedonia and West Bengal. Macedonia as a country has special cultural relation with West Bengal knowing that the St Mother Teresa was born in the capital of Macedonia, Skopje, and had spent most of her life in the City of Joy,” the Ambassador said. 
 
 According to him, the embassy of Macedonia in New Delhi along with the office of the consul of Macedonia in Kolkata has been promoting economic, cultural and trade relations between the two very successfully. 
 
 “There is a potential for these relations to grow and to be promoted even further by organizing business delegations from Kolkata and Macedonia. I have visited Kolkata for the last 10 years multiple times and have been working along with Bajoria to organize business and cultural events in Kolkata,” he added.
