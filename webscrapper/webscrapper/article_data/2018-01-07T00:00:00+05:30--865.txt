Gone are the days when classical dancing was something your family forced on you as a kid. Today, more and more people are turning to it even as adults, to learn a new skill and tone up their body. According to Aditi Yadav, a   exponent and teacher, “Classical dance is much more than a weight loss exercise. Not only does it help one relieve stress but it also gives their body balance, strength, and flexibility.”

  
 
 
  Bharatnatyam has many mental and physical benefits. Its basic stance, araimandi (a squatting position in which one’s knees are turned sideways), keeps the torso steady and helps to master body control. It is said the art form is highly beneficial for our eyes, as the dancer actively uses them in his or her performance, constantly exercising them.
 
  
 
  Kathak is a demanding dance that can really help us get rid of those extra kilos and stay fit. All the Kathakars (or Kathak dancers) have to practice and perform wearing heavy ankle bells, which makes for a weight-bearing exercise. 
 
 
 
 
  The postures that the artists make during this dance performance helps tone muscles, improves blood circulation, and increases flexibility. Apart from this, the dance form also emphasises on facial expressions, which double up as facial exercises.
