PANAJI: Goa   Akademi ( ) president   and vice-president   have resigned from their positions saying the Konkani body is starved of funds.

 Borcar said that the Akademi was expecting sufficient funds to undertake Konkani language promotional activities. Also bureaucratic redtapism was cited. Another member of GKA, Kamlakar Mhalshi, also tendered his resignation from the Akademi. A couple of months ago, two other members had resigned alleging non-cooperation from the government towards the promotion of Konkani through GKA.
 
 Tendering his resignation, Borcar said that there was no autonomy to GKA and for their proposals, they had to get clearance at various levels. Borcar said there was a high-level meeting to review the GKA functioning, but he was completely disappointed with the approach of the government towards the Akademi. A year ago, the government had proposed to give a huge grant for the development of Goaâ€™s official language. Members lamented that the government was only paying lip-service to the promotion of Konkani.
