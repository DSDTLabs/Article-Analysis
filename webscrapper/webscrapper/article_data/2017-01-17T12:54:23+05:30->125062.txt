PATNA: In the wake of the Sabbalpur diara   in Patna on Saturday evening that claimed 24 lives, the   (BSDMA) on Monday issued an advisory to all district magistrates (DM) to take coercive steps for strict implementation of the Model Boat Rules, 2011.

 According to BSDMA vice-chairman Vyasji, the advisory talks about compulsory license for all boats, optional training for boatmen, load line for maximum weight and special permission for night operations among others measures.
 
 “We have asked all DMs to strictly implement the Model Boat Rules, 2011. With regard to overloading, the rules state that there should be a red line all along the outer body of the boat and if the water level exceeds that level, the boat is overloaded,” said Vyasji. He added, “Mechanical experts from the transport department should inspect boat pumps to check whether they are in order. Permission is also required to be taken for night operation which includes provision for lights on the boat as well as boarding points.”
 
 Chief minister (CM)   in a meeting over the diara tragedy on Sunday asked BSDMA to take preventive measures and spread awareness to avert such incidents in future. Nitish on Monday said despite   (SOP) for mass gathering events, certain loopholes were evident in the kite festival organized on Saturday at the Sabbalpur diara in which 24 people were killed in a boat tragedy. 
 
 The BSDMA is soon going to submit a report to the state government about the preventive steps for avoiding boat tragedies in future. The corresponding study was conducted by the disaster management body following 42 incidents of drowning of people across the state during Chhath in November last year. Following the Chhath stampede at   in 2012 which claimed 17 lives the BSDMA had submitted a report on recommendations for mass gathering event to the CM and chief secretary. The report titled ‘A Case Study on Chhath Puja, 2013: Mass Gathering Event Management Prepared by BSDMA’ gave recommendations including identification of hazards, information on safe exits and route, crowd management and watch towers among others.
 
 Sources claimed that a number of such recommendations were not followed at the kite festival organized at the sandbar. For instance, there was neither any CCTV camera and public address system nor information of entry-exit routes and sufficient lighting.
