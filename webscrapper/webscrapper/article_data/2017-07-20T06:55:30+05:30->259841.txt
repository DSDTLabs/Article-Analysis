VISAKHAPATNAM: Lack of   along the 256.5 km stretch of the Nagavali River is posing a threat to people living on its banks in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts. 

 However, state irrigation officials say the 50-km stretch upstream of Thotapalli barrage in Odisha’s   district is the most vulnerable.
 
 The Central Water Commission is supposed to set up river gauges for sending   alerts to district authorities for timely evacuation of people living near the river. 
 
 However, lack of required facilities forces irrigation officials to record the water levels manually in order to send an alert message.
 
 Irrigation officials have informed both the Central Water Commission and state government about the inconvenience, but no initiative has been taken to set up the gauges.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Thotapalli irrigation project superintending engineer D Tirumala Rao said, “The cost of a river gauge is less than Rs 5 lakh. I do not know the reason behind the delay in installing the gauge at Nagavali. The neighbouring Vamsadhara river has two gauges.”
 
 “On last Sunday, we did not get any information from Odisha regarding the sudden rise in water levels in Nagavali. The water levels rose by 1.35 lakh cusecs by Sunday night from around 15,000 cusecs in the afternoon,” Rao added.
 
 Though there is one river gauge in Thotapalli reservoir, it is used only to measure the level of stored water, Rao said.
 
 Vizianagaram collector Vivek Yadav said officials informed him about the urgent need for a river gauge after the recent floods. “I will bring this issue to the notice of the government. This system is also important for updating real-time information about the water levels.”
 
 Flash floods are quite common in   River. In a tragic incident in 1996, a boat capsized and 34 people were killed.
