Visakhapatnam: On Friday morning, hundreds of motorists were found wearing helmets at the busy Old Jail Road Junction and BHVP Junction. It was for two reasons: the scorching sun and the ‘Win With the Times’ campaign by The Times of India.

 “I wear a helmet whenever I ride my bike. But it was special this morning as TOI rewarded me for following traffic regulations. I had heard of this campaign and also read about it, but today I was part of it,” said DM Rao at Old Jail Road.
 
 Those motorists who were spotted with The Times of India newspaper and following the regulations at these two junctions were also given gifts.
 
 “Traffic rules are meant to keep motorists and pedestrians safe. This campaign recognises those who abide by the norms and others are encouraged to follow the rules,” said K Nirosha, an MBA student, spotted at BHPV Junction driving a two-wheeler.
 
 “I am so glad to get such a beautiful gift which can be useful in the summer. TOI is successfully generating widespread awareness among the public with this campaign,” said another motorist P Manasa. 
 
 Organised by The Times of India, the campaign is supported by the city traffic police and Vizag RTA department and would be held at various junctions in the city till May 26 from Monday to Friday between 8.30 am and 10 am. On Monday, ‘Win with the Times’ campaign will be held at Birla Junction and Hanumanthawaka Junction.
