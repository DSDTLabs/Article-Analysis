BENGALURU: Nanyadarshini 2017, an annual exhibition by  , was a bonanza for philatelists and numismatists; they gathered at Shikshakara Bhawan, KG Road, on Friday to get a glimpse of the world’s smallest set of coins, as claimed by the organizers.

 The three-day exhibition had over 60 stalls and footfall of hundreds on the first day itself. If one is lucky to get through the crowd, he/she can spot a set of water-droplet-like coins made of pure  .  , which the organizers claim is the smallest coin in the world, comes from the 14th-century Vijaynagara empire. The coins, weighing 0.25-0.75g, were brought to the exhibition by Rajendra Maro, a collector-cum-dealer.
 
 The exhibition also had unique-numbered Rs 10 to Rs 2,000 notes, which were priced higher than the actual value because of their rarity. For example, rare Rs 100 notes cost between Rs 400 and Rs 1,000, said Sanjay Khatavkar, a dealer from Mumbai.
 
 Coins from first century
 
 Gautam Jantakal, another numismatist, said, “I have displayed coins from post-Mauryan-era towns Suktimati, Tripuri (modern Jabalpur) and Kasi Janapada (Varanasi). Largescale exhibitions like this motivates us to dig out more ancient coins. For a collector every coin is rare.”
 
 Other unique attractions from the exhibition included a 22-carat The Hobbit stamp from New Zealand, besides embroidered and radium stamps.
 
 P K Keshavamurthy, who was at his 138th exhibition, said, “I am a retired telecom employee and now dedicate my time to collect coins.” His collections included hairpin-like Persian silver coins called Larin from the reign of   sultan Ali Adil Shah (1657-1672 AD) and coins of Mysuru Wodeyars (1638-1659 AD).
