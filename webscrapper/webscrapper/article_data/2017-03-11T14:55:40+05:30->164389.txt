BHOPAL: After eco-friendly Diwali, the state capital is all set to celebrate herbal Holi this year, as wholesalers says around 30% of the Bhopalis are moving from chemical colours to herbal gulaal.

 According to wholesalers, people are ignoring chemical colours, as they don’t want to play Holi with colours that stick to the skin.  , a wholesaler at Jumerati gate, said, “People are not buying chemical or strong colours this year and are instead preferring herbal gulaal. The retailers from new Bhopal are coming with more demand of herbal gulaal. However, residents of old Bhopal are still fond of strong chemical colours.” Though the price of herbal colours is thrice of that of chemical colours, people prefer to buy it. However, as it costs more the wholesalers don’t have much stock of it, due to which they are running short of herbal colours. Another seller  , said, “People now don’t want to just keep scrubbing their skin after   and therefore they opt for gulaal, as it goes off the skin in a single wash and is less harmful.”
 
 Dermatologist Dr   said, “Chemical colours have high lead content, due to which people with sensitive skin are affected the most while people with normal skin suffer rashes and itching. Herbal colours are always safer. I would suggest people to apply coconut oil before celebrating Holi. Post-celebration they should avoid scrubbing the skin to wash off the colour in one go. Multiple wash is better than one, as it increases sensitivity if we try to remove the colour at once.”
 
 Pollution control board’s regional officer PS Bundela said, “We don’t conduct any check in the city, but we do conduct a drive at factories where these colours are manufactured to ensure that toxic chemicals are not used in excess. I would just request people to avoid chemical colours and go for gulaal. They should go for dry Holi this year.”
