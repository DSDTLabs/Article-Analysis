Panaji: Defence minister Manohar Parrikar was among the many leaders who descended at the polling station at the Government Primary School, Massano de Amorim, in Panaji.

 Political opponent and   rebel Subhash Velingkar, who backed the Goa Suraksha Manch, came to the same centre alone before voting started.
 
 Standing metres from Parrikar, who was to cast his vote at a different booth, Velingkar chose to ignore him. The duo did not make eye contact.
 
 The state is witnessing a four-cornered fight between the  , Congress, AAP and the alliance between MGP-GSM and Shiv Sena. “The other three corners are very weak,” Parrikar said about a threat from the alliance. tnn
