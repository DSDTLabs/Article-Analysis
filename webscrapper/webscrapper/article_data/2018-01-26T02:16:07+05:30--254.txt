NEW DELHI: An avid critic of BJP,   Arvind Kejriwal is scheduled to visit Nagpur this weekend to see the city’s development model. Kejriwal will visit highways and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari’s home   with his team.

 TOI has learnt that AAP chief will see the works of Nagpur Metro, built in the shortest time among all Metro networks in the country with a provision to meet at least 75% of its electricity needs from solar energy. “Kejriwal is scheduled to land in Nagpur on Saturday evening and will spend the entire Sunday in the city visiting different work sites and going through presentations. He is likely to see the city waste water management system besides the 24x7 water supply in the city,” said an official.
 
 During his recent interaction with Kejriwal, Gadkari had asked the Delhi CM to look into how the waste water generated in Delhi can be treated and sold to earn revenue. Nagpur Municipal Corporation has been selling treated waste water to power plants and has been earning revenue. Gadkari had also cited good work done in his home city, which Delhi could replicate.
 
 Sources said Kejriwal is likely to see how double decker elevated corridors have been built using single piers for plying of buses and other vehicles at one level and Metro rail at the second level. “This integrated planning has reduced cost of construction and you can build two facilities on the same right of way,” said a central government official. Political analysts said Gadkari is perhaps the only minister at Centre with whom Kejriwal is comfortable and the highways ministry has taken several pro-active steps to improve Delhi’s road network and decongest the capital city.
