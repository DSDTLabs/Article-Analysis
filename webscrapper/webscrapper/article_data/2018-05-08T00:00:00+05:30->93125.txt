It seems like a first for   — she will be playing a young mother in her next, Narmadha. Directed by debutante  , this will be yet another female-centric movie.   says, “It is a family drama that revolves around the relationship between a mother and her son. Nandita, for the first time, will play a young, bold and energetic mother of a seven-year-old. When I narrated the story to her, she told me that she hasn’t done something like this before. She told me that she will see if she can fit into the role. In 12 days’ time,   said she’s convinced that she can justify the character that I had written. This will be a challenging role and definitely not run-of-mill role or script.”

 Newcomer Renesh will play her son, and actors Vijay Vasanth, MS Bhaskar and   will be seen in pivotal roles. “Everyone in the team is doing homework for their roles. Renesh is taking some acting lessons, too. Nandita has already lost eight kilos for her role. We will begin shooting from May 15. Most portions will be shot in Chennai, Nagercoil, Tirunelveli and Hyderabad,” says Geetha, who has worked as an assistant to many directors, including Bala.
