GHAZIABAD: The SHO of the women’s police station in Ghaziabad landed in controversy on Tuesday after a video clip showing her hair being combed by a woman constable in uniform in the police station went viral. The   chief immediately ordered an inquiry.

 Aarti Soni, who heads the women’s police station located in Raj Nagar, did not contest the authenticity of the video clip but termed it a conspiracy against her.
 
 “For the last couple of days a video clip of a woman cop is being circulated in which a woman constable is combing her hair within the premises of the police station,” Manish Mishra, circle officer (CO), said on Tuesday. “After the purported video clip surfaced, SSP Deepak Kumar, has entrusted me with the responsibility of investigating the matter,” Mishra said.
 
 Asked about the clip, Soni said, “I admit I am the person shown in the video clip but it is important to know the circumstances under which it happened.” In her defence, she added, “A cricket ball hit me in the head while I was sitting with my colleagues outside the police station. A woman constable, Saroj, checked my head for a possible injury, raking her fingers through my hair in the bargain.”
 
 When asked who could be behind the video clip, she said some of her colleagues had a grudge against her and they must have shot the video and circulated it to malign her. “The investigation will vindicate me,” Soni said.
 
 CO Mishra, meanwhile, saids his investigation would also focus on the circumstances which led to this. “We will be questioning theones who shot the video to ascertain their motive but, prima facie, it looks like the policewoman in question was actually allowing a constable to comb her hair, which is unbecoming of an officer,” Mishra said.
