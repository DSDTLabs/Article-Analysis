Hyderabad: The Israel Ministry of Tourism conducted a roadshow at a city hotel on Wednesday, with the aim of connecting tour operators from Israel with their counterparts in Hyderabad. The networking workshop event was aimed at building better travel trade relationships with the Indian market and designing more travel and tour packages to Israel, for tourists in Hyderabad.

 While Israel witnessed a growth of 13 per cent, over the previous year, in 2016, the ministry of tourism hopes to maintain its double digit growth in 2017 as well, said officials. China and India have emerged as two markets with a lot of potential for tourist arrivals, they added.
 
 “Over the last couple of years, tourist arrivals from Asia, especially China and India, have been witnessing an upward trend. With Air India soon planning to introduce flights between India and Israel, as part of their plans to expand their international network, in 2017, we are hoping that the number of Indian tourist arrivals in Israel crosses the one lakh mark, this year. We have also noticed that while previously, Israel was only known as a pilgrimage destination, this is slowly changing, with more people coming to the country on leisure trips,” said Hassan Madah, director of Israel Ministry of Tourism.
 
 Figures indicate that while the number of pilgrim tourists visiting the ‘holy land’ accounted for a whopping 70 per cent of the total tourist arrivals in Israel, earlier, in 2016, this number dropped to 40 per cent. Those travelling to Israel on leisure trips accounted for 30 per cent of the tourist arrivals in 2016, showing a clear hike from previous year, added Madah.
 
 Speaking about the roadshow, Madah said “Israelis’ awareness about India, especially about regions like Hyderabad, is very limited. This roadshow is an attempt to bring about more awareness, about India and Hyderabad, among Israelis as well.”
