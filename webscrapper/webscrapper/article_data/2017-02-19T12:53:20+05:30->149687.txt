BHOPAL: The state   office will witness hectic activity on Monday as the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) meeting will pick Leader of Opposition (LOP). AICC is sending senior party leader Ajay Maken as observer for the selection will be a day before the budget session commences in the assembly. 

 The post fell vacant following demise of Satyadev Katare in October last year. Congress national general secretary Mohan Prakash who is also in-charge of party affairs will accompany Maken and jointly hold the meet, with PCC president Arun Yadav and acting LOP Bala Bachchan in attendance.
 
 After Katare’s death, Congress has 56 MLAs out of 230 in the assembly. Bypoll for the former LOP’s assembly constituency Ater in Bhind district has not been announced.
 
 “Tradition has been that legislators will be asked their preference. But MLAs will unanimously agree on leaving the decision with the party high-command who will decide the name and AICC will announce it from New Delhi,” a senior leader said.
 
 Those in the race include former LOP Ajay Singh, former minister in Digvijaya Singh government and close to Scindia lobby Mahendra Singh Kalukhera, Bala Bachchan besides ex ministers Ram Niwas Rawat and Dr Govind Singh. Sole Muslim MLA Arif Aqueel is the minority face. If party wishes to go for a Brahmin (as Katare was one), Mukesh Nayek or Sundarlal Tiwari stand a chance.
