Trichy: The Trichy Corporation has come in for praise by the commissionerate of municipal administration for successful implementation of segregated door-to-door collection of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. State municipal administration minister S P Velumani on Monday gave away the certificate of merit to the corporation which collected 4,568.55 tonnes of non-biodegradable waste from households across the city over the course of eight months.  Further, the civic body generated a total of Rs 95.28 lakh, selling recycled non-biodegradables to scrap dealers.  The civic body launched the novel waste collection in June 2017 in what was deemed to be the first-of-its-kind programme in the state. Since then, the corporation has been collecting non-biodegradable waste on Wednesdays and biodegradable refuse on other days. Apart from moving from house to house, the urban local body (ULB) has used 40 mini load trucks to collect the waste from households. With the civic body operating 17 micro-compost yards to produce compost from the biodegradable waste, officials said that segregated waste collection process has been helping the corporation to produce quality compost from the waste. The Rs 96 lakh money generated selling recycled non-biodegradable waste was distributed among 2,000 sanitary workers.  “Our efforts were appreciated with a certificate of merit at a state-level review meeting held at Chennai on Monday. Several other civic bodies including from New Delhi have studied our model to replicate it in their respective jurisdictions,” said corporation commissioner N Ravichandran said.  With the help of corporate social responsibility, the corporation has provided more than 2,000 bins to residents across four zones of the ULB to promote segregated waste collection at source.
