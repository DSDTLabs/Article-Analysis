NEW DELHI: Over 2,000 students gathered in front of the administrative block on Thursday to speak to   vice-chancellor over the order on compulsory attendance for students of all programmes from winter 2018 session. The students have alleged that the matter was not put before the recent academic council meeting, though the order circular claims the matter was passed by the council.

 “The administration, through the circular that imposed the compulsory attendance, had claimed that it is a ‘decision’ of the December 1 AC meeting,” said Geeta Kumari,   president. “It is a gross lie. The last academic council never took any such ‘decision’; nor was it even part of the AC’s agenda.” 
 
 On Thursday, the VC didn’t meet union and student representatives. Instead, chief proctor Kaushal Kumar spoke to them. The students were told that the VC would meet them on January 8. tnn
