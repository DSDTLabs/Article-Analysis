KOCHI: The doctors at government medical college,  , took out a protest march and stopped punching from Monday   to integrate them in the government sector. 

 Completing more than four years of government takeover on December 17, 2013, the medical college continues to be rather rudimentary in its facilities compared to other government medical colleges in the state.
 
 "When compared to government doctors, we draw only 60 % of the salary that is given to a doctor in the government medical college. Also there is huge difference in daily allowance (DA)," said Dr Unnikrishnan G, general secretary,  . The association had called for strike in January but claimed that they had withdrawn the strike after the director of medical education (DME) assured to constitute a committee to look into the issue. "But even after four months, there is no response and therefore as a symbolic measure, we have stopped punching from Monday. We also held a one-hour dharna," said Dr Unnikrishnan.
 
 On March 17, they had sought to know about developments in the matter but there was no response. "We have informed the government that we will stop punching our attendance, not cooperate in conducting medical camps, boycott all clinical and academic activities on May 3 except emergencies and boycott all academic activities from May 7, if a solution is not found by then," added Dr Unnikrishnan.
