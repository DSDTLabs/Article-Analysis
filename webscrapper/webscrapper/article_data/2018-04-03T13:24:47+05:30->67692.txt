VIJAYAWADA: The city municipal corporation will organise a   session for municipal students to help them give entrance examinations for admission into prestigious institutes.

 In a bit to guide the meritorious municipal school students, the city has organised a free training centre to help preapre municipal students for   and   (APRJC) common entrance examinations. Polycet examination will be held on April 27 and APRJC on May 9.
 
 “The students should make use of the classes and study well,” said  , city mayor, adding, “The students should meet the expectations of their parents and educate themselves. The only thing parents want from their children is devotion to studies.”
 
 About 65 students enrolled for the classes on the first day. The number will rise in all likelihood in the next few days, said M Srinivasa  , physical science teacher. The classes will be held from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm, and books will be provided for free to the students.
 
 The majority of the municipal students enrolled are the ones who studied at the advanced foundation centre, and the students who were selected for the SPARK programme organised by the city for 3-star students. Rao said the programme is organised to help students to get top ranks in the exams and get into coveted colleges in the state. The set-up is already there, along with the faculty, for the advanced foundational centre established to help the bright students get good grades, he said.
 
 However, the students were given free transport for the advanced foundational courses and providing the same is vital for the success of the programme, Srinivasa Rao said. 
 
 The mayor will be taking a decision on that soon, he added.
