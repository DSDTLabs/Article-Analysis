HYDERABAD: For  , the city’s first woman driver employed by cab aggregator  , the foray into the largely   was mostly about breaking conventions. The 34-year-old quit her job as the managing director of a school to ferry passengers across the twin cities instead.

 “I have always been passionate about driving and discovering more places within the city. The flexible working hours and other perks of the job were simply an added bonus. Also, I think there is a need to dispel certain notions about how women cannot take up certain professions,” said Bindu, who has been driving her cab around Hyderabad for almost a week now.
 
 Apart from completing her assigned trips, Bindu also has to constantly convince incredulous passengers that she is in fact the driver for the trip.
 
 “Many people, especially male passengers, find it hard to believe that a woman driver has been assigned to them. Female passengers, however, mostly appear relieved. Many woman commuters who have taken trips with me after 8 pm have admitted to being pleasantly surprised and immensely relieved to find a woman in the driver’s seat. They confessed that they feel safer with me,” said Bindu, who bought a car with help from Ola.
 
 Despite the safety measures put in place for her, Bindu often has to take the risk of ferrying passengers who are in an inebriated condition. “Although I have been working as a taxi driver for just a week, I have already ferried four or five drunk male passengers. But I did not face any issues as none of them misbehaved. Ola has given me the option of cancelling a trip or refusing to serve a customer at any given time, before or during the trip,” said Bindu, adding that introducing such measures will encourage women to become cab drivers.
