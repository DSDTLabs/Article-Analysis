My son is 16-year-old and he occasionally takes money from my purse and cash box. We have been observing this from the past 3 years. And even after talking to him, he continues this habit. My husband and I are now worried that he will continue stealing and turn to pickpocketing. Is there any remedy for this? 
 

 
  The tendency shown by your son is indeed worrying and requires proper evaluation; especially because it has been going on for a long period and your intervention at a personal level has not prevented this behaviour.
  
 Stealing in teenagers can be a symptom of many conditionsâ€” varying from being a part of attention-seeking behaviour, peer pressure, to a sign of the more serious personality patterns such as anti-social personality disorder, etc.
  
 The remedy usually depends on the precipitating cause. You can have a confidential talk with his teachers and friends to find out if this or any other disturbing behaviour (like anger outbursts, bunking classes, lying or use of banned substances, etc.) has come to their notice. I would also suggest seeking professional help as it may prove beneficial in this case.
