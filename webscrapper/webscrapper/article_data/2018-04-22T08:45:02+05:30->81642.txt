AHMEDABAD: In its verdict on the 2002 Naroda Patia massacre case, the Gujarat high court regretted the failure of the senior public prosecutor for the SC-appointed SIT to prove the electronic evidence in form of sting operation, though the prosecutor had got everything on a platter.

 The HC’s rap came for the designated senior advocate leading a pack of public prosecutors, each with experience of more than 20 years. “It is a matter of regret and concern that the prosecution, despite being represented by a senior public prosecutor, who supposedly was well versed with and experienced in criminal law, has not thought it fit to prove the electronic documentary evidence on record,” the court order reads.
 
 The HC said that significantly, the material of   was brought on record after a suo motu order by the SIT court. “Despite the fact that   (who conducted the sting operation) had produced a complete transcript of the sting operation, such transcript was only placed on record with a list and the learned special public prosecutor did not deem it fit to ensure that the same is proved in accordance with law and exhibited,” the HC said.
 
 The HC further criticized the prosecution, “It is difficult to believe that such an experienced public prosecutor was not aware of the importance of proving the sting operation and the transcript. However, for reasons best known to the prosecution as well as the investigating agency, they have not thought it fit to prove such important evidence in accordance with law.”
 
 The court further observed that while a CBI officer, an FSL officer and the director of Akashwani, Ahmedabad were examined to prove that DVDs and CDs were not tampered with, and that the voices of Babu Bajrangi, Prakash Rathod and Suresh Lagdo as recorded in the sting operation were established, “in absence of the DVDs and CDs being admitted in evidence, the entire exercise has been rendered an exercise in futility”.
