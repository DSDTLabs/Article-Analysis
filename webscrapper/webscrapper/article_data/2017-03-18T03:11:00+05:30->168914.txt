Nagpur: The number of co-opted corporators in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) may go up from the present five to eight as state government is planning to increase the number of co-opted members in all municipal corporations.

 A senior BJP corporator told TOI that the party is waiting for the numbers of to go up before going in for co-option. “The government is expected to complete the process of increasing corporators in three to four months, there is no harm in waiting till then,” he said.
 
 Currently, there are four co-opted members in BJP’s quota and one in Congress’ quota. If the number increases to eight then BJP’s quota will go up to five, Congress two and the last one will have to be decided jointly by Congress, BJP and BSP.
 
 A source in BJP also said that too many party workers were desirous of being co-opted as NMC corporators on the basis of work done by them during corporation elections. Hence, some party leaders wanted to wait for some time before things cooled down. The delay also means that city Congress president Vikas Thakre will not be able to become part of NMC anytime soon. While Congress has not finalized the name for co-option, Thakre’s selection is almost certain.
 
 Meanwhile, candidates for four important posts in NMC and Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) — earlier NIT — will be finalized on Sunday. “Currently, all the MLAs and MLCs are in Mumbai for the budget session of state legislature. They will return on Saturday evening. We will hold the meeting of BJP parliamentary board on Sunday,” the senior corporator said.
 
 The four posts for which corporators are to be finalized are — one trustee of NMRDA, two directors of Smart City Mission and chairman of Nagpur Mahanagar Parivahan Limited (NMPL).
