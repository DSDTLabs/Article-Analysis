CHHAPRA: Speakers at a symposium on ‘Recent advances in gerontology’ on Monday said   is a natural process and one must accept it gracefully. “One can lead a healthy and long life by following certain regimens and lifestyle choices,” they said. The symposium was organized by the department of zoology, J P University, as part of its silver jubilee celebrations.

 Gerontology focusses on social, cultural, psychological, cognitive and biological aspects of aging.
 
 “Growing old is a natural process and no one can escape it. However, one has to face certain physical disabilities at old age but even those can be prevented if one has a positive outlook and stays active both physically and mentally,” M K Thakur, a   teacher, said. “Add life to years you live and not years to your life. The average life span of an individual has increased today and one must plan for the age he or she lives beyond the age of 60. There's a lot one can do to improve one’s health and longevity and reduce the risk of physical and mental disability as one gets older,” he added.
 
 Thakur suggested taking up exercises, yoga, healthy diet and other preventive measures known as ‘Maintenance and Repair System’ (MARS). “With recent advances made in gerontology, gerontologists can help us in leading a care-free life in our golden years as they are healthcare professionals who specialize in the field of age-related dimensions of change,” he added.
 
 S K Singh, also from BHU, explained the role of medicinal plants in regulating fertility and maintain reproductive health. He suggested the use of neem (azadirchta),  ,  , dalbergia and cocculus plants to maintain fertility. He also stressed on the need to survey the region for collecting plants and undertake research work to find out their properties.
 
 JPU vice-chancellor   presided over the function and organizing secretary   welcomed the guests.
