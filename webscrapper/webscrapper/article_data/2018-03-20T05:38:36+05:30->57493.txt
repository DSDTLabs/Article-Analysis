NEW DELHI: India and US have pushed back next monthâ€™s scheduled 2+2 meeting of foreign and defence ministers until after the new US secretary of state   completes his senate confirmation also likely by mid-April.

 
 After the first visit by foreign secretary   to Washington this week, the two sides are looking at a summer meeting now.
 
 India and US have improved their convergence on defence, security and other strategic issues, but with the US threatening a tariff conflict, the economic relationship is headed for a rocky patch.
 
 Among the key interlocutors for Gokhale in Washington was  , US trade representative who has taken a tough line on trade measures against various countries, India included. Gokhale held talks with his counterpart,  , and met Congress and administration functionaries during his visit.
 
 India and US are also scheduled to hold their maritime security dialogue in Goa in May. But with a lot of personnel and political changes in Washington, this too could get delayed.
