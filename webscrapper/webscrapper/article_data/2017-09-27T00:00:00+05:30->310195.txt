Pranav Mohanlal’s debut film as a hero,  , is much awaited. While we had earlier informed that the actor would be flaunting his   skills in the   directorial, we now got to know a few more details about his character.
 
 “Pranav plays a typical urban youth named Aadhi. He is someone who loves music and wants to be a  ,” says Jeethu, who is currently busy with the movie’s shooting in Hyderabad.
  
 The team has been shooting for over a month now. Ask Jeethu if Pranav, who had earlier worked with him as an assistant director, is comfortable in his role as an actor and the filmmaker says, “I never felt he was nervous at any stage. There are obviously those minor hiccups when you are working in your first film but apart from that Pranav’s confident. He’s extremely hard working. In fact, for any job he does he puts in his maximum effort and that result shows in this movie too. He's learning every day and I am sure with experience he will be a fine actor.”
  
 The movie also marks the first time that Jeethu is working with a debutant hero. However, that hasn’t posed any challenges, he says. “Pranav got the script early and we had several discussions. Also, because he has been through the script so many times, he is able to add his improvisations,” says Jeethu. “He has talent. But it’s when the actor also puts in the effort, it becomes easier for the director. For me, directing him has been a seamless experience.”
  
 The team has now a month of shooting left. “We will be filming the action scenes soon and have roped in the services of a foreign action choreographer,” says Jeethu, adding that after the Hyderabad schedule, they will also shoot in Bengaluru and Kochi.
  
 Aadhi, which is also scripted by Jeethu, has Aditi Ravi, Anusree, Lena and Siju Wilson as part of the cast.
