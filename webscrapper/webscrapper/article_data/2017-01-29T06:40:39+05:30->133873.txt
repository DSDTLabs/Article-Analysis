AHMEDABAD: The winter chill returned to   on Saturday after a relatively warm week, due to snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir and other states of north India. Besides the northern snowfall, the main reason of the chill is that the western disturbance has moved away from over Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat due to which the clouds have cleared and dry winds have returned over the state.

 This appears to be the last round of chilly weather in the state, as meteorologists predict that the maximum temperatures will steadily rise in the coming days.
 
 Naliya in Kutch district was the coldest place in the state on Saturday with minimum temperature of 9.0°C. Mandavi, also in Kutch, was the second coldest at 10°C.
 
 According to   (IMD) officials, the chill is back as the maximum temperature has fallen sharply in the state. “As the western disturbance, which brought cloudy weather to parts of the state, has moved towards the east, the cold can again be felt in parts of the state,” Jayant Sarkar, director of  , Gujarat region, said. 
 
 “The impact of snowfall in the northern states was there but because of the cyclonic circulation due to the western disturbance, no significant change in the cold could be witnessed,” Sarkar added. 
 
 Sarkar said the maximum temperature will begin to rise from Sunday and the minimum temperature will remain same. “According to the current weather observations, it seems like the winter is leaving the state,” he said. 
 
 In Ahmedabad, the minimum temperature was 14.1°C but cold winds could be felt on Saturday morning and evening. The maximum temperature was 26.8°C, 2.4 degrees below normal. 
 
 The IMD forecast on Saturday said that dry weather is likely to prevail over Gujarat on Sunday.
