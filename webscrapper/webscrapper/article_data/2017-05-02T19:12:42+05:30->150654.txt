Gurgaon:   harvesting is the mantra that has of late caught the fancy of Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), which is readying itself to tackle twin problems of depleting groundwater   and waterlogging in Udyog Vihar. 

 Under an ambitious initiative, which may go a long way to address the industrial area’s water crisis, HSIIDC has decided to create a pond in Udyog Vihar Phase 1 to capture rainwater that will help recharge groundwater.
 
 HSIIDC sources said a part of the land, where the proposed pond would be dug up, used to be a MCG dumpyard. However, the civic body, following requests from the development corporation, has vacated the plot for the water   project.
 
 “It is the lowest spot in the area and used to be a part of a drain earlier. Hence, we have decided to turn it into a water body as rainwater will naturally flow into it during showers,” said a HSIIDC official from Gurgaon estate.
 
 Further, the development corporation is working on reviving all the 32 existing water harvesting pits in the industrial area. There are 14 pits in phases 1, 2 and 3 while another eight pits fall in phase 4 and 10 in phase 10.
 
 “These pits had been lying defunct for the past three years. But, recently, the corporation cleaned up and restored 15 of these pits. The remaining 17 are likely to be revived in next 15 days or so,” said the official.
 
 Authorities are hoping that the project will eventually help address the water crisis in the industrial area. TOI had reported earlier that   tables in the industrial estate had been depleting at an alarming rate. Water tables are resting around 250-300 metre below the ground in Udyog Vihar phases 1, 2 and 3 while in phases 4 and 5, the water levels have plunged below 400-metre mark.
