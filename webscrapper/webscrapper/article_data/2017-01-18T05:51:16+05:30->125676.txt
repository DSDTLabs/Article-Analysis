New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party is officially down to 66 MLAs in Delhi after the resignation of Jarnail  , MLA Rajouri Garden, was accepted on Tuesday. 

 Singh will be contesting a high profile, three-way battle in Punjabâ€™s Lambi constituency in the upcoming assembly elections on February 4. He will face incumbent chief minister   and   Congress chief Amarinder Singh there.
 
 Singh is known for his strong views on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots for which he also lost his job as a journalist. He will also have to give up his Delhi voter card and register in Punjab before he files his nomination.
