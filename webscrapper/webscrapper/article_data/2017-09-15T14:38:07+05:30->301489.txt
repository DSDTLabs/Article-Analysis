MAPUSA: Dempo Sports Club knocked out   1-0 to storm into the final of the 1st   football tournament at Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa on Thursday.
 Young midfielder Nestor Dias scored a fourth minute winner for the Goan outfit. It was Dempo’s third win in the tournament with an identical scoreline that gives former India captain Samir Naik a dream start to his coaching career.
  
 Dempo will take the field for Sunday’s final high on confidence, whether they battle   or Kerala outfit   in the title showdown.
  Pune had it relatively easy against Dempo juniors in the opening match of their group stage but struggled against the senior side.
  Captain Nickson Castanha led the charge for Dempo with a dangerous run on the right flank which earned his team an important freekick. Velito Cruz swung in a dangerous ball and Beevan D’Mello flicked it towards Nestor, who surprised goalkeeper Bilal Khan with a scorching half volley with his powerful right foot that crashed into the net.
  Pune were stunned and found it difficult to regroup. Dempo also did well to choke down the rival midfield duo of Gaurav Bora and Sajid Hossain which made it difficult for Gani Nigam to have a clear look at goal.
  
 The visitors missed the services of captain Ashique Kurniyan who was suspended after receiving a red card in the previous match. His replacement, Omega Vanlalhruaitluanga, was not mature enough and picked up a needless yellow card. He was replaced before the break.
  Pune made a couple of changes in the second session but could not penetrate the centre-back pairing of Shallum Pires and Mathew Gonsalves. Pulung Diamary came close but his curling effort missed narrowly.
  
 Dempo could have easily inflated their tally but Beevan, Kapil Hoble and Yogesh Kadam failed to give finishing touches to some promising moves.
