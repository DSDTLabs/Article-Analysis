LUCKNOW: In a major security breach, three male students entered   Girls’ hostel of   on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday after scaling a wall. One student was caught and handed over to police by mess workers and girl inmates while two escaped.

 The apprehended youth was identified as a BSc first year student and a resident of Habibullah hostel. LU authorities lodged a complaint at Hasanganj police station on Thursday afternoon.
 
 The security breach was detected around 12.15pm when girls were asleep and the mess staff making preparations for the next day heard some male voices and movement. As the staffers rushed out, they saw three boys peeping in rooms. They instantly raised an alarm that woke up the girls who rushed out.
 
 Mess staff and girls chased the boys and managed to catch one while two others fled. There was commotion in the hostel all through the night thereafter.
 
 “Almost all girls were asleep but mess staff was awake. Suddenly, some movement and voices were heard which raised suspicion. Three boys were seen trying to look inside girls’ rooms,” said a hostel worker.
 
 The girls instantly rang up chief proctor   who alerted police. They also clicked photographs and recorded videos.
 
 “As mess workers and a security guard informed us, we informed the police and reached the spot. One boy, heavily drunk, was taken into custody,” said Singh.
 
 The youth admitted that he and his two friends, all from room number 85 of Habibullah hostel, had entered the hostel.
 
 While that student has been suspended and barred from examination, the two named by him reported to the proctor and claimed they were being framed. An investigation has been ordered and a show-cause notice issued to the other two students.
 
 “The boy was detained under CrPC 151 and was released in the morning on a personal bond,” said LU police in charge  .
