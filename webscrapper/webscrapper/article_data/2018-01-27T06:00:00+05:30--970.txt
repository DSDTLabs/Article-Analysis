The Dargah of Shah Muhammad Qasim, popularly known as the Dargah Hazrath Shaik Ji Hali Ra at   Shareef,   transformed into a realm of mysticism as it hosted the   Basant Panchami celebrations recently. The Dargah was decked in yellow and the music aficionados who turned up for the event too sported yellow dupattas. The prominence of the colour draws reference from the history of the festival that dates back to 12th century when celebrated Sufi poet   used to dedicate songs of spring to his   (spiritual master)   donning the season's colour. The festival, which stands testimony to the Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb of Hyderabad, enthralled Hyderabadis with the famous Khusro poems and devotional songs such as Zehaal-e-miskeen makun taghaful and Duraye naina banaye batiyan, among others.
