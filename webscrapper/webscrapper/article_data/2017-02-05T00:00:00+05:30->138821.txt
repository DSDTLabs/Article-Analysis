On a flying visit to Nagpur on Friday, double   and ace wrestler   spoke about sports, sportsmanship and his future plans.

 
 
 Sushil is the first one to express his happiness over the appointment of Olympic gold medal winning shooter Abhinav Bindra, badminton legend   and former   captain   to the Olympic task force. He says, “Inclusion of players like   and Pullela Gopichand in Olympic task force is the best news for Indian sports. Only players can understand the problems and dilemmas faced by the athletes. I feel India will win a lot of medals under the stewardship of these brilliant players. I’m also sure that problems of inadequate diet for players, lack of facilities and kits will be ironed out.”
 
 
 
 Boxing ace Vijender Singh had recently said that if Sushil Kumar joins the professional circuit in wrestling, he can become a superstar with his immense talent and skills. To this, the wrestler says, “It is Vijender’s love that he says such wonderful things about me. But yes, I’m still negotiating with WWE authorities; I have to iron out a few things before I take a final decision on going professional.”
 
 
 
 And will sports lovers see him compete in a major tourney anytime soon? To this, Sushil replies, “I’m focussed on the   that is scheduled to take place at the end of this year. I will try to give my best for that.”
 
 
 
 Sushil who has come to Nagpur quite a few times, admits that he has great fondness for the city. He goes on to add, “Nagpur is very special for me, and soon I plan to start a special initiative for young wrestlers of the city. This is all I will say for now and reveal the rest when things are finalised.”
