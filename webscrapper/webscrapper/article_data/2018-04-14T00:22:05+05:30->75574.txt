THANE: Following a fire in the electric meter unit of the operation theatre (OT) at the Thane   on February 10, the   continues to remain shut making it possible for only minor operations to take place since over two months. 

 The minor operations are being conducted in a mini OT near the trauma centre at the hospital. The mini OT has just one theatre, while the main OT had three.
 
 Most patients coming to the hospital from various partsof Thane district for treatment are being transferred to government hospitals in Mumbai as the mini OT is unable to bear the load. 
 
 “We have come across patients who have been transferred to government hospitals in Mumbai as they could not be operated here. We recently came across a woman with stomach problem and a rickshaw driver, who needed an orthopedic surgery, but they were asked to go to KEM hospital in Mumbai as they could not be operated here,” said an activist.
 
 On the other hand, officials at the hospital claim that they have been carrying out many operations in the mini OT.
 
 “We have carried out over 185 operations since the main OT was shut. We had to shut down the main OT as the wires were burnt due to short circuit and proper wiring had to be done. The work will be completed in the next 10 days and the operations will be carried out again there,” said  , civil surgeon of the civil hospital. 
 
 A doctor here said that the hospital was currently giving first preference to surgeries of pregnant women as they cannot be shifted, especially in critical conditions. Also, there are fewer surgeries of other departments conducted as there is just one OT in the mini theatre.
