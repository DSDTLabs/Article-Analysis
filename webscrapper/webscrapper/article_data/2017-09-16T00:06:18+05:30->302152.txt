NAVI MUMBAI: Two crucial amenities for the inland waterway project, involving the   Maritime Board (MMB), are at a “decisive stage” this month. The facilities are the marina planned in Belapur and the passenger water terminal in Nerul. 

 Bidding for the marina, which was planned in 2015, will close on September 25. The bids will be scrutinized starting from September 27. The marina will be developed by the MMB on a public-private partnership basis. The MMB tender is for selection of the developer, operation and maintenance of the marina. 
 
 “We will discuss various options and evaluate the revenue-sharing models and the facilities to be provided by the bidders to select a strategic partner,” MMB sources said. The MMB had appointed Crisil Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Ltd, a subsidiary of Crisil Ltd as the consultant. 
 
 BJP MLA Manda Mhatre who has been pursuing the marina project in Panvel creek told TOI, “I spoke to Cidco MD Bhushan Gagrani on Friday and he confirmed that Cidco had agreed to transfer 7 acres of land on the waterfront to MMB at a token Re 1. The project was held up as Cidco had asked for payment of several crores. I intervened and the MD has agreed.” 
 
 Clearance for a mangrove patch for the passenger water terminal from the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) is expected to come by the month-end. Cidco had sought permission from the MoEF in November 2016. 
 
 The passenger water terminal to be developed by Cidco and operated by the MMB will be located behind Delhi Public School, Nerul, off Palm  . The waterway routes proposed by the authorities are Nerul to Mandwa in Alibag and Nerul to Ferry Wharf, south Mumbai.
