Chennai: Public-sector lender Indian Overseas Bank on Tuesday told the BSE that Rotomac defaulted on its loans since June 30, 2016. These loans were sanctioned by a consortium in which Bank of India was the lead bank. IOB said that Rotomac Global Pvt Ltd has been its client for nearly a decade. When it defaulted on its loans, IOB moved the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and restrained the company’s directors from leaving the country in August 2017. The same was communicated to the regional passport office in Lucknow and immigration authorities in Delhi. In September, Rotomac group was first referred to NCLT by Bank of Baroda, after which IOB filed its claim, said Anurag Shankar, CFO, IOB, in a filing to the exchange.

 “This is to inform you that Rotomac Global Pvt. Ltd. has been banking with our bank for almost a decade and was sanctioned credit limits in due process under consortium arrangement in which Bank of India is leader. The limits were backed by cash margin and immovable property as security and the guarantee of its promoters/directors and corporate guarantee,” said IOB.
 
 “The borrower was referred to NCLT by Bank of Baroda and was admitted on 20.09.2017. We have filed our claim with NCLT,” said IOB.
 
 In an earlier interview, IOB MD R Subramaniakumar said the bank has a total exposure of Rs 8,200 crore under NCLT in 24 accounts.
