 Goa Foundation filed a complaint against former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar before Goa   alleging his involvement in renewal of 88 mining leases, on Friday. The Supreme court, last month cancelled renewal of 88 mining leases.
 
 Pawan Kumar Sain, then secretary mines, and director of directorate of mines and geology, Prasanna Acharya have also been named in the complaint, filed under Prevention of Corruption Act.
 
 The complaint charged that “the above persons entered into an unholy conspiracy to renew 88 mining leases to several persons in Goa. These renewals appear to be result of corrupt acts,” said Claude Alvares, secretary, Goa Foundation in the complaint.
 
 The complainant has asked Lokayukta to investigate the circumstances that led to the en masse second renewal of 88 mining leases to various private stakeholders (lease holders) including one multinational corporation from the period November 1, 2014 to January
 
 1, 2015. The 88 mining leases were with a total annual production capacity of 44 million tonnes.
 
 It further stated illegal second renewals were done in order to benefit private persons and companies. “As a result, of these renewals, they benefitted by operating the mining leases allocated for nearly three years from the period 2015-2018, till the intervention of the Supreme Court of India which set aside all these illegal renewals.”
 
 The renewals also resulted in colossal losses to the public exchequer as they temporarily halted the recovery process of thousands of crores, and were therefore completely against public interest. They were carried out in willful violation of the provisions laid down in the
 
 MMDR Act, Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 and the two Supreme Court's judgements. The actions, taken jointly and severally, attract Section 13(1)(d) of the PC Act, reads complaint.
