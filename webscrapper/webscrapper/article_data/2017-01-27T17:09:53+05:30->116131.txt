One of the most well-known and successful business partnerships in the Malayalam film industry; that of   and  , seems to be heading to a rift. 

 Sandra has filed a case with the Elamakkara Police Station, alleging that Vijay Babu beat her up on Tuesday. Sandra was also admitted to a private hospital in Kochi, where she is undergoing treatment. Sub Inspector Mithun of Elamakkara Police Station confirmed the news to Kochi Times. 'The two of them owned a production house together. They had been having issues for the past few days and there was a confrontation on Tuesday. She has alleged that Vijay Babu hit her following a fight. Sandra has been admitted to a hospital and we have taken a case based on her statement,' he said. 'We will be investigating the issue after asking the staff if they were present at the scene or not,' he added.
 
  However, when we contacted Vijay Babu, he told us that the case is a fake one. He has also posted the same on his social media account, where he said, 'Friends, a fake case is filed against me by my most trusted partner and her husband for the sake for taking over business property which I disputed. I shall prove it otherwise and will be fine. Thank you for the concerns (sic).'
 
  Sandra and Vijay Babu started their joint business venture by producing the film Friday and went on to make films like Zachariayude Garbhinikal, Philips and the Monkey Pen and Adi Kapyare Koottamani. Sandra's husband, Wilson John Thomas, also an entrepreneur was present with her while filing the case, said the police. The two got married in July 2016.
 
  Meanwhile, the incident has come across as a shocker for many of their common friends in the industry. Actor Aju Varghese has said, 'I know both of them personally and professionally and hope they get over this. They have introduced many new faces in the industry and hope they will make many more good films together.'
