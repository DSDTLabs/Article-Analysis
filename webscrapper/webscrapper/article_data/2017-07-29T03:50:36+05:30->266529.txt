THANE: Following the death of its 10-year-old student due to  , a city school is planning to organise   sessions for his classmates who are grappling with his sudden death.

  Aaryan Medhekar, a student of St John the Baptist School, who was detected with the   virus last week, passed away on Monday. 
 
 Fiona Alvares, a teacher at the school, who was Medhekar’s class teacher for three consecutive years, said, “Aaryan was a lively and slightly mischievous boy who won the hearts of everyone he would interact with. He was passionate about football, cricket and any extra-curricular activity, including dance shows and theatre plays. He made friends easily. He was always filled with energy and enthusiasm and we were all broken when we heard the news of his death.”
 
 She added that some of his friends are still unable to deal with the fact that he is no more and will not be coming to school. “While we are all saddened by his demise, we have kept ourselves free if any of his friends want to discuss why he isn’t around anymore, so they get some closure,” she added.
 
 While the school arranged for a prayer and memorial service on Wednesday, they are planning individual and group counselling sessions for his classmates.
 
 “As the school examinations are just around the corner, all the students are immersed in their studies, which in a way is distracting them from the incident. All those who were close to Aaryan require some time to collect their thoughts and let the situation sink in, as his death was very sudden and came as a shock to many. Once the exams are over, we will be keeping some grief counselling sessions for anyone who would require it,” said Minal Pinto, school counsellor.
