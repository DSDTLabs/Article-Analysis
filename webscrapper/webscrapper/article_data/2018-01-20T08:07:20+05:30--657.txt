LUCKNOW: Expressing displeasure over the failure of the state government to prepare a database of pharmacists across   and link it with their Aadhaar number within the stipulated period, the   of Allahabad high   summoned the principal secretary of food safety and drugs administration department on February 5 to explain as to why it should not frame contempt of court charges against him for wilfully flouting its directions. 

 A division bench comprising justice   and justice   passed the above order on a public interest litigation petition. The petitioner had stated that there were fewer registered pharmacists in comparison with registered medical retail shops. Under the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and relevant rules, it was mandatory for every retail shop to have a registered pharmacist who should remain present during the working hours.
 
  A large number of fictitious or unqualified persons or one person using his registration certificate in several shops was looking after such shops. The petitioner alleged that the state government had not taken any effective preventive steps in this regard . 
 
 The government stated that it had decided to prepare a database of registered pharmacists before proceeding in the matter.
 
 The bench had directed the government to complete the exercise of preparing a database of all pharmacists in whose names retail medical shops were registered, and linking the names with their Aadhar number. The court had directed the government to complete this exercise within three months.
 
 When the matter came up for hearing last week, the bench was apprised that the state government has not complied with the earlier directions.
