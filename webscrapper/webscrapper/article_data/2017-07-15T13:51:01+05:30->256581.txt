"I visited   for the first time 25 years ago with my girlfriend. She was my co-actor and we rushed to the Taj after completing our shoot," said  , who was recently in the city to promote his show,  . Reminiscing his first visit to the city, he said, "We clicked a lot of pictures and spent some time under the trees of the premises. I don’t have any of those pictures now but I clearly remember everything about that trip."

  Tej, who has started his career as a second lead in the film   (1979) with Mithun Chakraborty, has largely played negative roles. He says, "It was because of my father, late DK Sapru, who was also an actor, that I entered the industry. I was always interested in sports and played badminton at the national level for Maharashtra. I also got a job in a bank in the sports quota but, eventually, I turned it down to pursue acting." 
 
  Talking about his journey in   films, he says, "I was mostly offered negative roles, I think it’s because of the colour of my eyes, which are blue. But negative roles didn’t bother me as I believe an actor should be able to play every kind of role. I took up opportunities as they came my way and I don't regret anything."
