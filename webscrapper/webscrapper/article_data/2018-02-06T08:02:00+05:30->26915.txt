HYDERABAD: A stone’s throw away from the famous   mosque, in the narrow bylanes, stands a Qutub Shahi-era structure that paints a sad picture with no visible effort made to attract visitors.

 Hidden from view and erased from the city’s memory, this crumbling heritage structure is the tomb of Khairati Begum. It’s also known as Khairunnisa’s tomb.
 
 While the minarets of the tomb are covered with overgrown vegetation, which could be the reason for huge cracks developing, the entire structure is also filled with a thick layer of black deposit.
 
 The vegetal growth is particularly heavy on the dome, which is also covered with a thick layer of black deposit. According to locals, the black layer could have formed due to vehicular pollution.
 
 Along with the impressive stuccowork, the lime plaster — used because it is less prone to cracks and shields softer materials from shear stress — can also be seen peeling off at many places.
 
 Heritage activists say the tomb has been lying in this condition for years, though it is a protected architectural monument.
 
 “My last visit to the tomb was heartening. There was garbage strewn everywhere, construction material lying on the platform and graffiti on the walls. It is among the worst maintained heritage structures in Hyderabad,” said P Anuradha Reddy, co-convener of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH).
 
 “This monument has been crying for attention since years. If this is the condition of a heritage structure that is right in the heart of the city, imagine the condition of other monuments,” she said.
 
 The tomb, though known as Khairunnisa’s tomb, is not her tomb. It was built by Khairat-un-Nisa, daughter of   (1612-1626), for her teacher  . However, the tomb has been lying empty ever since   died while he was on a pilgrimage and not in Hyderabad.
 
 An official from the State Archaeology and Museums Department said tenders were passed and repair work of the tomb will start soon.
