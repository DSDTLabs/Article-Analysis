BENGALURU: While Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas — finally inducted into the Indian   (IAF) — will take wing at the 11th edition of  , new aircraft developed by defence   (HAL) will debut at the aviation extravaganza. Its partner SAAB, a Swedish firm supplying equipment to the armed forces since mid-1970s, will also showcase its strength.

 HAL’s highlight will be a mock-up of its proposed Indian Multi-Role Helicopter (IMRH), which it hopes will be bagged by the army and the navy. Both have evinced interest in a big-lift next-generation chopper.
 
 “The project is in its initial stage, and we have taken it up ourselves. The army and the navy have shown interest in choppers of this type and we hope our helicopter will meet their expectations,” a senior HAL official said.
 
 Among the debutants are the indigenously developed Basic Trainer Aircraft, HTT-40, light utility helicopter (LUH), the indigenously upgraded Hawk-i and Jaguar. The light combat helicopter (LCH) will also take flight at the five-day biennial air show, scheduled between February 14 and 18. 
 
 HAL’s indoor pavilion will be spread across 1,282 sqm. “In addition, customer demonstration flights would be held for ALH Mk III Dhruv and Mk IV (Rudra). HAL will also hold business meetings with OEMs, sign agreements and contracts with business partners for various projects during Aero India,” HAL said.
