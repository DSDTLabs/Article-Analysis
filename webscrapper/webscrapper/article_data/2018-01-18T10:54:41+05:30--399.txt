KOCHI: The education department has proposed three synthetic tracks in the district. 

 "The proposed tracks will come up at Government VHSS  , Government VHSS   and Government HS  ," said C A Santhosh, deputy director of education,  .
 
 "The selected schools have the space for this facility. Large ground is required to set up the track. Space is also required to construct a gallery," he said.
 
 He said that they have proposed for a 400-m synthetic track at Chottanikkara and 200-m track at Maneed and Namakuzhy. Currently, no government schools in the district provide this facility to students. Most government schools in the district depend on the synthetic track at  's College ground for training purposes. 
 
 "The new tracks are not just for the school but for the region and the district. It can be used by schools for practice and for district, state or national-level sports events," he added.
