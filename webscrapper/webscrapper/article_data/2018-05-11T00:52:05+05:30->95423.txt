Tourists were banned from taking bath at   falls in   in Theni district for the seventh consecutive day on Thursday as the water flow at the falls continued to be high. With summer vacation beginning, the number of people visiting tourists places has increased manifold. They are forced to return disappointed because of the ban issued by the forest department. 

 Forest officials said that the ban would continue for at least a few more days as the rain continued to lash   hills.

The hills had received scanty rain in the last four years and water problem has been an issue during the summer. V  , a resident, said the rain helped increase the water level considerably in the reservoirs, which take care of the drinking water needs of Kodaikanal town.
