So much has been said and written about the   Mahal. The monument of love has found its way into numerous poems, books and tales and in this case, the stage. The two-hour play is about   wanting to build Taj Mahal for his deceased wife   and deals with greed, bureaucracy and corruption in modern times. An adaptation of an older play, it is being directed by Aditya Dubey. The play kicks off with Emperor Shah Jahan on stage (played by Sarthak Kohli) in conversation with Mr Gupta (played by Aditya) who is the chief engineer. Says Aditya, “This is a   that throws light on the rampant corruption that one may see today. Shah Jahan, who is keen to build his monument of love is helpless in front of Gupta
 . He gets stuck with its tender - sometimes he has to contend with an issue over the ground for it, sometimes it’s about the marble flooring to be used and other issues and he gets fed up. Soon,   also starts to object, saying it’s getting too expensive to do this. The conversation between all the characters and the situation they find themselves in, add to the humour on the stage.” 
'Tajmahal ka Tender' has different vibrant characters – there is a 
 performed by Gourav Nain), who handles land contracts, then there is a 
 , another person from the pollution department and more. Shah Jahan’s six 
 are also worth looking out for.
