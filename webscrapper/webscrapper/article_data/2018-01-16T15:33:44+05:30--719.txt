It looks like veteran actor   is having a fun time shooting for his first straight Hindi film,  . The film, which is directed by American writer-filmmaker Chuck Russell of The Mask fame, has  , Akshay Oberoi, Asha Bhat, Atul Kulkarni and Makarand Deshpande as part of the star cast.

 An excited Vijay tells us, “It was great fun shooting for the film, but, at the same time was a huge challenge for me as I was the only actor from the South on the sets. Though I know Hindi, I can’t speak the way they do. So, I had to practice my lines carefully as I was quite worried about my dialect. If they cracked a joke, by the time I could think of a comeback line, they would have moved on to the next topic. Vidyut, in fact, kept saying that I was speaking Hindi very well and that I was just not confident enough.” Thalaivasal Vijay plays Vidyut’s father in the film, who runs a sanctuary. “The film focuses on the key issue of elephant conservation, ivory poaching and human-animal conflict which has become rampant today. It was great fun living in the forests and shooting for the film.”
 
 Talking about his experience working on the film with the director Chuck, he says, “He is so cool and out of the world. He spends a lot of time working on the character. He gave the script even before he began the shoot and there was absolutely no change in the dialogues and scenes.” 
 In the meantime, the actor is working on a host of films including 100 Percent Kadhal, Keni and   and is also busy with his television serial  .
