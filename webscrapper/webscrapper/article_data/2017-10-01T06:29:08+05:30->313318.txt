MUMBAI: A day after the Elphinstone Road station stampede that killed 23 people,   president   slammed the   bullet train project at the annual Dussehra rally of the party in Shivaji Park on Saturday.

 "The route was chosen to loot Maharashtra," Thackeray said. "Why is the bullet train not from Kashmir to Kanyakumari or Delhi to Srinagar? What is the need for a bullet train? Just because someone is giving a free loan? It is like giving a free snake to the people."
 
 On Friday's tragedy on the narrow foot over-bridge, he said the issue should not be politicised but the "government should act" on it.
 
 "One does not need great brains to widen the bridge," Thackeray said. "But we act only after a mishap. And then a `high level inquiry' is announced to escape from the situation. Railway officers will realise what the problem is only after they are made to climb up and down the same bridge during peak hour." He said the party would continue its agitation against the Centre over inflation and said it could withdraw its support to the BJP-led state and Union governments at any time. In his 50-minute speech, Thackeray asked Shiv   if they were rea dy to face the election to bring about real `achhe din'. "I will not wait for a `muhurat' to withdraw support. Are you (Sainiks) ready to work hard in the elections to bring real achhe din?" he said.
 
 Thackeray also slammed demonetisation and GST.
