Model-turned-actress  , who was seen as Jiiva’s sister in   2, has pinned high hopes on her next, a   film, which is set against a campus backdrop. The actress, who made a brief appearance in  , is determined to take up only those roles which give her ample scope to perform. In fact, she said ‘NO’ to a character which was offered to her in a Dulquer-starrer and to a leading director some time ago. 

 She says, “I don’t regret refusing those roles as I felt I hardly had anything to do in those projects. If I take up a character, it should have substance. I’m currently in talks for a big Tamil movie which has a leading director at its helm.” 
 
 Samiksha, who took a brief hiatus post Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi, to pursue a degree in  , says she has plans to shape up a career in singing and dancing, too.
