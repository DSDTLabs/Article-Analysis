THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP state president   said here on Friday that only the "criminals" in the   could justify the police action against  's mother Mahija. 

 "Only criminals would feel that there was nothing wrong in the police action against that mother. Other CPM leaders who believe in democratic values have come out against the police excesses. Only  , M M Mani and P Jayarajan have justified the police action. Since the chief minister himself has justified the incident, there is no doubt that the probe into the police action would prove to be an eyewash," he said.
 
 Kummanam advised Vijayan to give up his false pride and asked him to call on Mahija and console her. Since VIjayan has proved beyond doubt that he could not control the police, he should relinquish the home portfolio, he said.
 
 BJP former state president  , meanwhile, asked Vijayan to take action against the police officers responsible for the atrocities against Mahija, if there was any sincerity in his words that he could understand the mental agony of a mother who lost her child. 
 
 "Even after Jishnu's mother telling the DGP that police attacked her, Vijayan claims that there was no police action against her," he added.
