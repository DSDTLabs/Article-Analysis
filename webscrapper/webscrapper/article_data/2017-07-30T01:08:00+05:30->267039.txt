Coimbatore: The Joint Action Committee of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisation – Government Employees’ Organisations (JACTTO-GEO) coalition on Saturday announced a protest march in Chennai on August 5 demanding pay parities and scrapping of the new pension scheme. 

 Addressing the media at Thomas Club on Saturday, one of the coordinators of the protest, V Senthil Kumar, said, “The joint action committee of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ organisation and the government employees’ organisations have come together to stage this protest on August 5 in Chennai. We will march towards the Madras high court to place our demands.” 
 
 Senthil Kumar said that they have three demands to make through their protest. “We want the state government to do away with the new pension scheme. In the previous pension scheme the state government would provide pension to the employee and if he/she is not alive, it gets transferred to the spouse. In case the spouse is no more, then the children are eligible for the pension,” said Senthil Kumar. “The new pension scheme has not addressed this. There are nearly 4,000 government employees who joined service in 2003 and have retired or died in service. They have not been benefitted out of the new pension scheme,” he added. 
 
 The second demand of the organisations was to correct the issues of pay parity in the seventh pay commission and implement it in the eight pay commission. “The details of the pay parities will be provided to the state government for consideration,” said Senthil Kumar. 
 
 The final demand of the organisations was to release 20% of the arrears as interim grant. “There is a delay in releasing the arrears of the seventh pay commission. We want the state government to release 20% arrears immediately,” said Senthil Kumar.
