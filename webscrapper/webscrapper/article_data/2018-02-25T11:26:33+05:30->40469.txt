PATNA: The state conference of All India   (TMC) ended in a fiasco here on Saturday as two groups quarrelled and came to blows at   of Ashoka Convention Kendra here.

 While the meet was to begin at 11am, it was all over in less than an hour with no one left inside the venue. The 5,000-capacity Bapu Sabhagar had only around 50 participants, said security guards at the venue.
 
 “A group of TMC people was seen bashing a participant. They brought him out of the hall beating black and blue. Soon, the meet was over,” said an eyewitness.
 
 Curiously, the arches created at the gate of the venue had the picture of Arjun Singh, the party’s MLA from   in North 24 Parganas district. Singh, back in October 2016, had gone on newsmen’s camera hurling abuses at the opposition party workers shouting slogans against him. He had also threatened to shoot them down.
