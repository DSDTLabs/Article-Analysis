Shama Ahmad, who is from Dubai, is a 1st year B-Voc filmmaking student at St Joseph’s College and is interested in acting and filmmaking. Shama wanted to pursue a full-time degree in the same, but since they didn’t offer one in Dubai, she moved to Bengaluru. “Interested in acting and filmmaking, I wanted to get into the technical field of the film industry. I moved here since St Joseph’s was the only college that offered a full-time degree in it. I have been to India before, but it is my first time in Bengaluru. The place is lovely, apart from the traffic. The people here are good and the friends who I mingle with are very good and helpful too.”
 
 Coming from an Arab country, Shama says she finds the city faster paced compared to Dubai, since people over there are laidback, take time to do things and have a very reserved lifestyle. “I feel that if I was here born and brought up here (India), I would’ve done many things in my life. All we have done in our childhood is go to coffee shops, sit and have a coffee, and would come back home. When I hear stories of people who are from India, like how in their childhood they would climb trees, and pick mangoes and all that, I wished I had experienced something similar in my life.”
