KOCHI:   on Wednesday decided to appoint retired district judge   to inquire into an allegation raised by a student from the department of marine geology and geophysics that she was harassed by three faculty members, including the head of the department.

 A team headed by   pro vice-chancellor had inquired into the matter and based on their report the three faculty members were suspended. The student had used the mobile phone to record the video of her professors allegedly hurling bad words which resulted in the action.
