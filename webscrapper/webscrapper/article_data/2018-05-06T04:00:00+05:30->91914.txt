Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has become the first civic body in the country to get a grant of Rs7.5 crore from NITI Aayog’s Atal Incubation Mission for a period of five years. All other civic bodies were issued grants under the first phase for educational institutions or industrial bodies, but SMC has been given financial assistance to give a boost to research and undertaking. This would enable Surat Smart City Development Limited and the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed under Surat Smart City Mission to reach new heights.

 “This grant would go a long way in helping people who are focused on developing new innovations and technologies. It would help us build a platform for newcomers from information technology and non-information technology-based industries,” municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said. 
 
 The first phase of Surat incubation centre is expected to be launched in June. A SPV has been set up for Surat Ideas and Innovations Lab (SURATiiLAB). SURATiilab would be single window for entrepreneurship, industrial ecosystem and start-ups in the city. 
 
 “This project aims at promoting local innovations and give impetus to make in Surat products,” former special commissioner, Surat Smart City Mission, M Nagarajan said.
 
 This is essentially a two-phase project. The incubation centre is being set up at SEPC building in Udhna under the first phase. This would have 120 seat space for start-ups, a training room, meeting space, co-working space, amphitheatre and cafeteria for local entrepreneurs. Partners would be empanelled for conducting innovations, incubation and start-up related work. The phase one would cost Rs 3 crore and is likely to be complete in a few months time. Apart from diamonds and textile sectors, focus will also be on food processing and industry 4.0 design laboratory work.
