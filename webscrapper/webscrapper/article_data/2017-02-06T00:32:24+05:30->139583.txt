NEW DELHI: Residents of   in southwest Delhi were in for a surprise when they found at least a dozen Wagon R cars with their doors forced open by car thieves on Friday.

 The miscreants had stolen the “brains” of the car — a small, easily removable part called the Engine Control Module (ECM) — which practically paralyses the vehicle and can be used to steal other vehicles of the same brand without raising an alarm.
 
 Police suspect that a demand for stolen Wagon R cars might have motivated the theft. Police said the thieves opened the bonnets using break-in tools, some of which was captured in a CCTV footage.
