BHUBANESWAR: Fresh from the success of hosting the Asian Athletics Championships, the state government is planning to introduce sports in school curricula from the next academic session.

 The State Council of Education, Research and Training (SCERT) will prepare class-wise syllabi and a calendar of activities on sports, health and physical education soon. The students will be graded on their performance. Steps would be taken to ensure that the grades count in the Class X board certificate, official sources said.
 
 "The details are being worked out by the   in consultation with the SCERT," the sources added.
 
 "The point of making physical education and sports a part of the curricula is to create sportspersons and develop a sporting culture among children. The courses will help create awareness about the need for physical fitness among youngsters," director of elementary education Chudamani   said.
 
 The government has decided to appoint one physical education teacher (PET) in each school. Currently, there are 2,486 PET teachers in 23,096 upper primary schools. "Schools that do not have PETs can take the help of those that do. Part-time instructors will also be appointed. Besides, sports meets will be held regularly in schools," Seth added.
 
 Separate manuals will be developed by the Board of Secondary Education for junior (classes 1 to VII) and senior (classes IX and X) sections. "Junior section students will be given simpler activities. For higher classes, the emphasis will be on specialized games. Self-defence may be included from Class VI," said an officer in SCERT.
 
 Sources said at least three periods per week would be earmarked for health and physical education, including mass drills, games, lessons on physical fitness, yoga, and self-defence activities.
