 "For me it was like I want to make a film the way I want to. I have to be honest and loyal to my job. Also the release date is not in my hands. I was not looking at at it (referring to clash). It doesn't matter who competes with which film."

But I do believe the numbers are phenomenal. My producers are happy and so even I am happy. Two days back I was at Gaiety Cinema (in Mumbai) watching the last show, I saw people were waiting till the end of the film. People were going crazy, they were whistling, dancing." 
 
 Not only the audience but even B-town celebrities have liked 'Raees'. "Lot of people from industry are saying good things about the film like  ,   and others. It feels great when people come and praise your film," Rahul says.
