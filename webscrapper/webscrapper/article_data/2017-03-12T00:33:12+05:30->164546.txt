 The activists added that an agreement was signed with the municipal council to rehabilitate slums dwellers and pave the way for flyover construction. “But a portion of the work has been stalled as the civic body has failed to rehabilitate around 4,000 slum dwellers spread over sixteen pockets,” they added. 
 
 Even the MSRDC had to stop the flyover work due to PMC’s failure to rehabilitate slum dwellers, they added.
