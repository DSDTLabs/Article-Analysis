 This family never had tryst with politics but after head of this family Sanjeevan   was martyred in Pathankot airbase attack many politicians visited this family but it yielded nothing good for them.

But now, I am alone to face all odds. No one is there," she said.
 
 Disclosing her tryst with politicians, she said that leaders from the   and   had promised memorials in name of her husband and a job for her son but all proved false. "My only son Shubham (23) was in second year of BPharmacy when this tragedy happened. On job assurances by political leaders he withdrew from the course and now is sitting idle. His carrier is spoiled," added Pinki. With tears in her eyes, she said she was worried for her son's future. The only job he is doing now is making rounds of government offices, she added. 
 
 "My son is young. I am worried that he may get depressed due to this in absence of his father," she sobbed. "In the name of memorials, not even a single stone has been installed anywhere," disclosed Pinki.
