PATNA: The decomposed body of a 40-year-old man was recovered from a room in Hotel Ashok Vihar in Gurdwara Lane off Fraser Road under Kotwali police station area in the city on Sunday. The deceased was later identified as Rajan Kumar of East Patel Nagar under Shastri Nagar police station area.

 According to the hotel records, Rajan reached the hotel at 4pm on April 17 and he was provided room number 19. According to the entry made in the hotel register, he came from Jamshedpur and had to go to Ranchi.
 
 Waiter Sonu Kumar said Rajan was last seen around 5pm on Thursday (April 27) when he had called him to bring some snacks from the market. Police sources said the hotel manager or staff did not check the room till Sunday morning. 
 
 Kotwali SHO Rama Shankar said the person probably died on April 27 midnight. “Though reasons for his death are still unknown, preliminary investigations do not indicate any foul play,” the SHO said, adding the snacks brought by the waiter were found on the table beside the body.
 
 He said the half-naked body was found on the bed with legs hanging. “Forensic science experts have gathered evidences for further investigation,” the SHO said.
 
 According to police, Rajan was running a transport firm in Patna. He had also been fighting a legal battle with his wife Sarita Devi for the past few years.
 
 “According to our information, he was advised by his counsel to leave his residence and start living away from his wife. Following the advice, he booked the hotel room,” the SHO added.
 
 Jaspreet Singh Gandhi, who owns the building in which the hotel is running, said foul smell was coming out from Friday evening itself and he had informed the hotel administration about that, but they ignored. 
 
 “Since we were asked not to enter the room unless called, even for routine cleaning, we avoided entering the room. We informed the police only after the foul smell became unbearable,” said a hotel staff.
