NAGPUR: A car driver, Imtiaz Abdul Jabbar, 47, has been slapped with charges of kidnapping after he drove away with a constable instead of taking the vehicle to traffic police post as directed on Thursday. The traffic cop, Jagdish Mandpe, had asked Jabbar to take the vehicle towards   square traffic post for completing formalities of legal action. The cop boarded the vehicle to ensure that Jabbar does not flee. 

 Mandpe, deployed at Automotive square on  , is learnt to have stopped Jabbarâ€™s   as it had tinted glasses. As Jabbar, who works under an auto dealer, did not have the necessary documents with him, Mandpe had asked him to take the vehicle to Indora after getting inside the vehicle. As Jabbar started taking the vehicle towards Satranjipura instead of Indora as directed, the cop alerted the police control room and traffic wing on walkie talkie. Police swung into action and intercepted the Innova after around 3-km chase.
 
 An offence has been registered against Jabbar at   police station.
