NEW DELHI: What do the   mean for the Modi government's   policy? There has been some speculation that the government had been waiting for the 
  to be over to pick up the threads of engagement with Pakistan, which have gone into deep freeze since the 
  . 

 After a 
  in crucial state elections, Modi now appears politically unassailable. This has implications for his foreign policy, because winning elections halfway through a government's term is tricky everywhere, but he seems to have cracked the code. And that will make him a global leader to reckon with, particularly if established democratic leaders are seen to be floundering in elections across the world this year.
 
 Within India's immediate neighbourhood, Modi's political strength will help in his dealings with other countries. An immediate beneficiary is likely to be   PM, Sheikh Hasina who will probably be the first to visit India in April. Modi is likely to go around  's obstructions to work out a deeper security and resources-sharing relationship with Bangladesh. India might find it easier to deal with Nepal, which is again sinking into a state of political instability. 
 
 But Pakistan remains the real question. In 2016, Modi took a tough approach to Pakistan after the Uri attack, which included the 
  of September 29 and a decision to

 During the election campaign, Modi received a lot of popular support for the strikes across the LoC, and his tough approach. He could continue that, using the popular victory as a vindication of his policy. On the other hand, he could use his victory to reach out to the Pakistan leadership.
