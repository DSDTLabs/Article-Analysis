NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Council ( ) has indefinitely   the   of   to   the   conditions for the property. 

 Under the existing conditions, only a handful of hospitality players like ITC, Oberoi and Taj could have bid for the hotel. The issue of “highly restrictive” bidding was raised with NDMC during the pre-bid meeting, which has led to rethinking over the process. “We are convening a meeting of the council to decide on a few issues that were raised in the pre-bid meeting,” said a senior NDMC official. The new timeline for the process has not come out yet.
 
 An official of a hospitality company said that they got to know the process had been delayed after they visited the site. “Following the site visit, all those who were pitching for the property were to send queries to the council for clarifications. NDMC’s reply was that the process and all subsequent steps had been deferred. We have not been told when it will resume and what the new bidding qualification conditions, if changed, will be,” said the official.
 
 NDMC’s ‘restrictive’ qualification requirements say only groups already running five-star hotels in India can bid for Taj Mansingh. The groups should have at least 500 rooms in not more than five 5-star properties, and have a sizable net worth and operational income from the hotels. This leaves out financial investors and foreign hotel operators.
 
 NDMC has kept a minimum reserve price of Rs 32.2 crore for Taj Mansingh. The tender calls for a minimum revenue share arrangement of 17.25% of the gross revenue and a minimum guarantee fee of about Rs 3 crore per month, subject to escalation, to be paid by the successful bidder.
 
 Under the schedule that has now been deferred, the process for auctioning was set off on December 9, 2017, by issuing the notice inviting tenders. NDMC is yet to declare when the auction, which was to be held on January 30, is now going to be held.
