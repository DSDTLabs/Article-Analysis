PUNE: Worries are mounting in the banking circles that the persistent “out of cash” broadcast might prod people to withdraw more cash than required, worsening the   over the next couple of days.

 “The next two days are critical,” said a bank manager of a public sector bank. “We are observing a pattern where the average cash volume is the same, but the value of withdrawal is higher. Problem is that cash is going out, but not coming back,” he added.
 
 Bank of Maharashtra’s managing director and chief executive officer Ravindra Marathe told TOI that the bank has not received any directive from the RBI to keep any of its ATMs closed. “Only 40 out of our 1,850 ATMs nationally were not functioning today (on Wednesday),” he said.
 
 Bankers, however, acknowledged that some banks were facing a problem for a variety of reasons, including hoarding, rabi crop harvesting requirements and upcoming elections in some states.
 
 RBI estimates show that the currency with the public as on April 13, 2018 was Rs 18.7 lakh crore — higher compared to the same period last year. “RBI has increased the currency but they have also stagnated it. In the sense that there is no evidence to show the currency growth has kept pace with economic revival,” said a senior currency manager of a public sector bank.
 
 Citizens said some areas in Pune were running out of cash faster. Many youngsters even said the day has arrived for them to reactivate their e-wallets. “I will reactivate my e-wallet as I can use it for my grocery shoppings at least,” said Neeru Jain, who had come to withdraw money at an ATM in Baner. 
 
 Rs 2,000 notes scarce
 
 Although bulk of the ATMs were pushing out currency on Wednesday, Rs 2,000 denomination notes were not dispensed. Also, banks have recalibrated some of their ATMs to hold Rs 200 notes – which   say was just given to them as a “darshan” once.
