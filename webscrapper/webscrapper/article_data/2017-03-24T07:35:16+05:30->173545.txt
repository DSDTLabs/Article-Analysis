JAIPUR: Facing rise in operational and maintenance cost, the Jaipur   Rail Corporation ( ) will increase fare slab for the first time after it’s launch. 

 The revised fare will be effective from April 1, 2017. As per the policy, the JMRC has mandate to increase the fare in every two years. The increased fares will directly depend on increase of per unit purchase of electricity, dearness allowance rate of state government employees and monthly all India consumer price index for industrial workers. 
 
 A senior JMRC official informed, “On January 2015, the JMRC was purchasing electricity from JVVNL at Rs 6.25 per unit. Now, it has been increased to Rs 7.30 per unit. Similarly, consumer price index consumer price index has been increased by nearly15% . The JMRC has existing a formula to calculate the increase in price. The rates will be revised on that basis.” 
 
 Sources said, there will not be an exponential hike in the fares and Rs 3-5 are expected to be increased in maximum fare. The JMRC will announced the revised rates after a board meeting scheduled to be held on Friday. 
 
 “ The revised rates will not burn the hole of the commuters as existing rates are not high. As JMRC provides 15% discount to its smart card users, we promote that all the commuters should use the facility.” added official 
 
 The JMRC is struggling to earn revenue as average ridership in   dropped from 49,774 per day in the first month (June 2015) of its operations to just 19,390 per day in December 2016.
 
 This has also resulted in revenue loss for JMRC as it could earn Rs 70.44 lakh per month after spending approximately Rs 3.5 crore per month on its operations. The route of phase-I (  to Chandpole) has already been criticized by the   government several times as it is financially not viable.
