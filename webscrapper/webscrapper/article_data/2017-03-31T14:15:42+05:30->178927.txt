   There is a concerted attempt to bring The Viral Fever founder-CEO, Arunabh Kumar, to justice, and the entire movement is being virtually run through anonymous sources. There are two key figures in this fight. One is a Twitter personality called @Corporate Kumar_, who was the first to send out the blog post by Indian Fowler to the media, and describes himself as a “Corporate and Government insider”.    The second is an Indian businesswoman (again, anonymous), who was one among 100 women to bag the Women Achiever Award instituted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development in 2016, and speaks about women in the workplace at international forums. The following is an online conversation with Corporate Kumar who claims to be in contact with all 11 victims, two of whom have already filed an FIR and points out that four more FIRs will be filed against the TVF founder.            Corporate Kumar: We can talk here. This handle has been active because it operates on an IP address that keeps hopping. I use dark web to chat. You can also log onto (name of site). You would have to use a laptop to talk; it will not work on a mobile.        I just brought the truth out. I got all the girls to co-ordinate with each other, and ensured that there are journalists who are speaking to these girls. The blog didn’t go viral because I tweeted it, it went viral because girls came out and spoke to journalists. But one of them released a screenshot of a chat between me and the girls. Since then I have not shared any private information. I will not reveal their identities. One of the girls has been hounded out of the country. Another is so broken that she had to turn to church. One of them is a single mother, she lost her job when she shared her story. The second one is a young girl. She was so broken that she had to undergo psychiatric treatment.        I have effectively verified complaints from 11 girls, even though over 50 people sent me direct messages. I verified their stories by communicating with them directly using the same bridge (alternative entry points into a network that are not listed publicly) that I am using to talk to you. I couldn’t verify beyond 11 due to the lack of time or perhaps, because of scepticism.        I am a man based out of Delhi. I am from the same profession as you are. Also, I’m not the Indian Fowler.        Speak to (anonymous identity). He will tell you that Arunabh is in Goa. My sources have told me he is there.
