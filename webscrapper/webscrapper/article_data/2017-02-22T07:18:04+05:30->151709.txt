KOCHI: The   is all set to present the 266-year-old church in a new light on Friday with the help of  . The structure's roof which was in a decrepit state has been reconstructed along with the walls, floor and the  , while retaining its original character. The reconstruction, which has been completed using intricate sculpturing and contemporary tools, has not used any of the modern construction materials like iron rods or concrete.

 "The entire structure has been built just like how the pyramids in the ancient ages were put together using catenary arch and Nubian masonry techniques. Catenary arches and ocular opening domes shaped the structure of the church. The construction, which was designed by Vinu Daniel, entailed an expenditure of Rs 1 crore," said Fr Benjamin Thomas, vicar and manager of Koonan Kurishu Pilgrim Centre. 
 
 A Nubian vault is a type of curved brick structure. "The roof which is the only edifice that has been reconstructed has been made using the soil and sand from around the church in Nubian architectural style. Earlier, the roof was an old tiled structure, typical to the topography of the land. The structure is completely eco-friendly and is an unconventional design in our locale," the Vicar added.
 
 The project's programme convener said that employing this particular architectural technique was an attempt to present something unique for the public. "This is an extremely eco-friendly architecture as no artificial constituents were used for the construction. This form of elevation and structure is possibly the first-of-its-kind in the state," said  , the project programme convener.
