Few even went on to say that she is acting like a different person just to create a good image among the audience.

 The new development is that 'Indru Netru Naalai' comedian   has come in support of Oviya joining many celebrities and public. He recently took to twitter saying, “Its clear Oviya is not acting in #Bigg Boss becos she needs Dialogue prompt to act#Oviya Army #Oviya Navy".
 
 It can be noted that Karunakaran and Oviya have acted together in Sundar C’s  , in which she was paired opposite Mirchi Shiva (2012).
