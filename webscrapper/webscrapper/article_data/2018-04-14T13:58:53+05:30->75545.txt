Even though Prabhjyot, who has been a regular to the city, was visiting Lucknow after a span of just one year, the actor feels that the city has changed a lot. "Last year when I saw Lucknow, the metro was under construction and this year when I came, I could actually see it running. So I can say that the city has developed a lot in one year. Darsheel Safary, Anushka Sen and I, we have made plans that we would go out to explore some of the parks here, which I got to know are a must-see in Lucknow. Bahut hi achhe parks hai yahan where one can go and spend a full day."
Apart from parks, this foodie also had plans to taste the famous Lakhnawi food. "Being a  , I am a complete foodie. Every time I come to Lucknow, I make sure to taste as many dishes as possible which Lucknow is known for. Right now also, I am actually craving the delicious biryani and Tunday Kababs. I am just waiting to get free from the event and then I will go and have all these things," shared the actor. 
 Prabhajyot, who will soon be seen in a film named Gold with Akshay Kumar, shares his experience of working with the Khiladi. "Working with a superstar like   was a dream come true for me. Kuch nahi, bahut kuch mila seekhne ko mila mujhe from Akshay sir. He is a great mentor. He is so punctual on shoots that he is on the sets five minutes before the given time. That is one thing that I loved the most about him. And yes, one more thing which I really liked about Akshay sir was that he never took more than one or two takes for a scene. He is a true perfectionist!" shared Prabhajyot.
