NAGPUR: When there are   from the   on curbing extension of services of retiring employees, the cash-strapped Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) has proposed to extend services of a divisional manager by two years.

 According to sources, divisional manager with Thane division SB Chavan is retiring on October 31, 2017. However,   is pushing for extension of Chavan’s services raising eyebrows within the company.
 
 A GR issued on November 9, 1995, clearly states that extension of services should be considered under very exceptional circumstances and should be in public interest. GR is also applicable to state-owned companies and corporations like FDCM.
 
 A decision by   in April 2014 to extend services of company secretary SV Joshi by two years was withdrawn after state government rejected it. 
 
 Umesh Agrawal, managing director of FDCM, said, “We are considering an extension to Chavan. It is up to the government to agree or not.”
 
 Agrawal said decision was being taken as there was no eligible assistant manager who could be promoted as divisional manager. “I have to run the Thane division, which I can’t without a divisional manager,” he added. 
 
 A section of retired FDCM employees said, “The state government has fixed the age of retirement. The purpose of retirement is that after certain age there are diminishing returns. Besides, it will put financial burden on the company.”
 
 “On the one hand FDCM has not paid PF dues of over 1,800 retired employees amounting to Rs 2 crore, while on the other extension was being given to a divisional manager. It would mean allowing efficient force to remain unemployed,” said Hirachand Mishrikotkar, former president of FDCM Employees Sanghatana.
