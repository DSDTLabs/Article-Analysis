CHENNAI: If Sasikala had guts, she should answer the charges levelled by O Panneerselvam about forcing him to resign, instead of pointing fingers at the DMK, said   working president M K  .

 A few hours after Panneerselvam alleged that he had been forced to resign as the chief minister, Sasikala accused Stalin and DMK of scripting the OPS plot. She said Stalin and OPS used to exchange smiles in the assembly, which betrayed their tacit understanding.
 
 While Panneerselvam reacted to Sasikala’s accusation saying the difference between human beings and animals was that human beings could smile, Stalin said blaming OPS for smiling at him was laughable, because going by that logic, what would have Sasikala and co done to Jayalaliathaa, because she also used to smile at him.
 
 Stalin said he and Panneerselvam used to look at each other in the assembly and smile to uphold “political decency. Perhaps Sasikala did not like it”.
 
 “As the leader of the opposition, I attended her swearing-in as chief minister last year and greeted her, for which Jayalalithaa thanked me. Could Sasikala ask the same question to Jayalalithaa also?,” he said in a statement.
 
 He recalled that when Jayalalithaa was hospitalised, he had visited the hospital to enquire about her health and later paid his last respects after she died. He had also consoled Panneerselvam, who stood near her body. He said the DMK had nothing to do with the “internal squabbles” of the  .
 
 He also demanded a CBI probe into Panneerselvam’s allegations that he was forced to resign to make way for Sasikala to become CM.
