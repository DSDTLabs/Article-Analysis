  Salman will be seen in the 'Race' franchise for the first time, which was earlier headlined by  . 
 
  When asked how did he come on board for the franchise, Salman said, "'Race 3' script was offered to me two years ago but I didn't think I fit in the genre. I asked   to make some changes because I didn't fit in that genre. Once that was done, I thought it would be actually a lot of fun to do this film." 
 
  The 52-year-old superstar said this is the first time where he will be seen in a full blown 'musical-action bonanza'. 
 
  "Earlier, we used to have a 'musical action bonanza' which hasn't come in a while. A film with big scale music, emotion, action, youth kind, which you watch, whistle in the end and go back home happy. This is one of those films, which I've never done at all," he added. 
 
 'Race 3' also features  , Jacquline Fernandez, Bobby Deol, Daisy Shah, Saqib Saleem and Freddy Daruwala. 
 
  Salman said no one has been favoured in the film on the basis of their stardom. 
 
  "We didn't go for the star value, we went with the characters. They should justify that. It doesn't matter who's doing well and who isn't. Everyone has been treated equally in the film. Once you watch it, you'll realise this," Salman said. 
 
  While the first two installments were helmed by Abbas-Mustan, 'Race 3' is directed by Remo D'Souza. 
 
  Remo said handling so many stars on set was not difficult as the script was very well etched out. 
 
  "Salman had heard the script two years ago, I came in later. Then we all worked on the script and made necessary changes. The script was so brilliantly written, all the characters were etched out," he said. 
 
  "Race 3" is scheduled to release on June 15.
