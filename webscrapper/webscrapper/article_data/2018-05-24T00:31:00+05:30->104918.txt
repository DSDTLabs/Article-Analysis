Vijayawada: A two-day tech fest for the third year electrical engineering students of Potti Sriramulu Chalavadi Mallikarjuna Rao (PSCMR) Engineering College saw several prototypes on display - the culmination of a month-long collaboration between the students and teachers.

 The tech fest helped students discover the importance of practical learning, something that was stressed by teachers as absolutely essential in a rapidly evolving industry with ever-changing needs.
 
 “The projects displayed by students explain the fundamental principles of electrical science. They will learn a lot by applying the principles and witnessing the results,” said Rajendra Babu, head of the department.
 
 “Such learning has become rare at many engineering colleges in the state and elsewhere,” he added.
 
 Mindful of the decline in practical learning, the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) recently proposed changes to the engineering syllabus by laying more emphasis on practical learning. It has reduced marks for theory and has given more weightage to practical examinations. Some city engineering colleges were quick to grasp the significance of making students work in labs, and the rest of the colleges are slowly following suit.
 
 Experts say a passion for practical learning of various engineering subjects has to be kindled among the students. “The mindset of students has to change. Many students take up engineering without passion, and in such cases, colleges have to nurture them and create an interest for practical learning,”experts said.
 
 Teaching faculty also have to undergo training to teach the subjects practically, said O Mahesh, principal at Andhra Loyola College of Engineering. They also underwent a similar education with much emphasis on the theory part, he said. The teachers should get involved in industrial projects and faculty development programmes should be held to enable them to upgrade their skills, the principal added.
