Vijayawada: A Class X student from a city school bagged the top spot at in   Olympic Round of the first   School   2018, a national programme for development of sports in the country, held in New Delhi between February 6 and 8. He ended up grabbing 2nd overall rank in archery in the under-17 category.

 K Venkatadri, 14, a student of St John’s English Medium High School, is now readying to participate in the Asian Cup qualification rounds for under-20 category to be held on Saturday in Rohtak, Haryana. Venkatadri said three of the first eight students who grabbed ranks in the Khelo India 2018 competitions will be selected to represent India at the Asian Cup games.
 
 “I want to play for the Indian team, and become a world champion,” he said. Venkatadri practices for about eight to nine hours a day at the CH Volga Archery Academy, founded by his first coach CH Satyannarayana. His training hardly allows him any time for studies, but he said he manages them with the help of his school. The school has also backed him, and waived off his tuition fee.
 
 The bow shooter said that he first got interested in the game at a summer camp that he attended when he was in 3rd class. Since then he never looked back. His father K Sivaranga Rao said that a little support would definitely help his kid achieve the goals. He said that he spends about four to five lakhs on his kid’s game every year.
 
 Venkatadri said that he is best suited for the compound category, one in which shooters use a bow made with latest technology, instead of wooden bows. However, the category is not yet introduced in the Olympic Games. Venkatadri said that his body language suits best for the compound category. He said he would stick to it.
