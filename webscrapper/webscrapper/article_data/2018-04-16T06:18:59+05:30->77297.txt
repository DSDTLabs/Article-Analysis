LUCKNOW: In an embarrassment for the BJP government in  , several ministers, including the deputy CM and the state spokesperson, sent out greetings Sunday on their Twitter accounts for the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.

 They later realised that their greetings were seven months in advance. Guru Nanak’s birth day falls on November 23 this year.
 
 Social media was quick to notice the goof-ups by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, health minister and state government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh, medical education minister   and law minister Brajesh Pathak, some of whom later deleted their tweets.
 
 
 
 A day before the tweets, chief minister   had visited   in Lucknow as part of   celebrations.
 
 Later,Siddharth Nath Singh posted an apology on Twitter. The “confusion”, he said, “happened due to Wikipedia”. He attached a screenshot of a Wikipedia page highlighting the incorrect date mentioned.
 
 “Sorry for Guru Nanak Ji’s birthday tweet. Confusion happened due to Wikipedia (enclosed). Apologies to everyone,” he tweeted.
 
 Despite several attempts to contact Maurya and Tandon, they remained unavailable for comment.
