NEW DELHI: The   asked the   police on Wednesday to conduct probe against the state’s two former chief ministers — N Dharam Singh and H D Kumaraswamy — for their alleged involvement in permitting illegal mining of iron ore in Bellary district.

 A bench comprising Justices P C Ghose and R F Nariman asked the   of Karnataka police to file a report within three months and restrained all other courts, including the high court, from passing any order in the case.
 
 The court passed the order on a plea of one of the complainants, T J Abraham, who alleged that the former chief ministers connived with several bureaucrats in granting permission to various companies to carry out mining activities on forest land. He referred to various reports of the then   Justice N Santosh Hegde indicting several politicians and bureaucrats for allowing illegal mining in the state.
 
 Agreeing with his plea, the bench said there was “no action” taken on the reports of the Lokayukta and probe should be done to find out the veracity of the allegations. However, another former chief minister S M Krishna, who has recently joined BJP, got relief as the apex court said that the investigation against him shall remain stayed till further orders.
 
 The probe against Krishna was stayed by the apex court on November 16, 2016 on grounds that the then Lokayukta had not found any evidence against him.
