Kolkata: Voices against the Central Board of Film of Certification’s suggestion to mute certain words in the documentary based on   are getting louder by the day. Netaji’s grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, who fought the 2014 Lok Sabha polls on a   ticket, on Thursday said that the   had no right to stifle anyone’s views. “We may not agree with #Amartya Sen but the Censor Board has no right to strangle the voice of anyone. Discussion on issues is a fundamental right,” Bose said in a recent post. 

 Bose doesn’t find any reason to be perturbed over Sen’s using “controversial” words like cow and Hindutva or his making a reference to the Gujarat riots (Godhra). “People may not agree with the interpretation. Yet, we should listen to the other view when it comes from Amartya Sen,” the BJP man said, even as his party colleagues tried to discount Sen’s version. 
 
 “We can’t deny that there was riot in Gujarat in 2002 and it was as big a development as the Partition. There have riots in the country many times. Suppression of facts is not a solution,” he said.
 
 Parting ways with the saffron camp on this issue, Bose held that Sen’s comment was not directed against any individual or a particular party — Narendra Modi or the BJP. “Sen has made his observation from a larger socio-political perspective. I don’t see how it affects the PM or his party when the court has already exonerated BJP from the rioting charge,” he said. 
 
 Writer Amit Chaudhuri, too, said: “Beeping out has become endemic. It reflects a lack of education where the only norm is power.”
 
 Tripura governor  , however, disagreed with the view. Roy said he believed Sen’s reference to Gujarat has an implication on Narendra Modi. Roy wanted people to restrict themselves to their core competence. “Neither he (Modi) nor Amartya Sen knows Bernoulli’s theorem (on energy conservation), which I do. But Modi knows what it takes to be a good PM. I say no one knows everything, not even Amartya Sen,” Roy said.
