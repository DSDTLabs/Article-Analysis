NOIDA: Union minister   on Wednesday slammed the ruling   over family feud and said that ‘this was infighting of thieves for share of stolen money.”

 Just an hour before the election commission announced the dates of UP election, Sharma held a press conference in Noida said that it is the family matter of Samajwadi Party. “This is an infighting for share of stolen money. I advise them to play cricket, but don’t spoil the pitch,” he said.
 
 SP supremo   expelled on Friday   chief minister   and general secretary Ramgopal Yadav from the party for six years. However, next day Akhilesh was not only inducted in the party fold and was also made national president of the SP.
 
 The Union Minister said that the Samajwadi Party had come to power, promising that the corruption of   leaders in previous government will be investigated and Mayawati will be jailed. “Nothing happened since they came into power. No one was jailed. It was the CBI which took initiative and arrested the Noida Authority engineer Yadav Singh for his corrupt practices,” Sharma said.
 
 Sharma denied that he will be the face of UP chief minister in the election. “The party will decide the CM candidate on right time,” he said. On Demonetization, Sharma said that it was a well-planned programme of Prime Minister to curb black money.
 
 “The Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched Jan Dhan Yojna in which around 23 crore bank accounts were opened. This was to ensure that most people get connected to the banking system before the demonetization comes into effect,” he said.
 
 Sharma added that he travelled in different districts of Uttar Pradesh and found that most people in the bank queues supported the move.
 
 He inaugurated the works of 76 kilometer roads completed in Rs 27.19 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna in Gautam Budh Nagar. He said that the works of installing 2000 solar lights have also started in the district under the Atal Jyoti Power Scheme.
