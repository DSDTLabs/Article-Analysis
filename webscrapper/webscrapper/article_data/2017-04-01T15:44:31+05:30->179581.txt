Singer   has defended her outspoken social media entries, insisting she is trying to call out social injustices. The 19-year-old Swedish pop star regularly comments on current affairs online and although some critics have slammed her for being too outspoken, she feels it's her duty as a celebrity to spotlight society's problems. 

  
  
 "I really look for things that are happening right now, things that are trending on Twitter that spark some kind of frustration in me, I guess," the 'So Good' hitmaker says. 
 
 "Like I see some injustice or inequality going on, obviously in  , since (President   took office), or in   when they were debating about making abortion illegal - there are so many different places. It's not like I wake up and everything is just great, and everything is equal, and I'm like, 'I'm going to be mad today'. That's not really what it's about."
