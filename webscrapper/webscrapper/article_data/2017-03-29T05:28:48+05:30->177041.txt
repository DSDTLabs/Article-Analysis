IDUKKI: Revenue officials have rubbished the claim of chief minister   and Devikulam MLA   that the latter’s controversial 8-cent   at Ekka Nagar, Munnar, holds original title deeds.

  The officials said no tax has been paid till date for the land. Though the land was given title deed since 2000, KDH village officials refused to accept tax due to the irregularities in awarding the deed, it is reliably learnt.
 
  An official, on condition of anonymity, said that the officials refused to collect tax since there were concrete evidence that it was encroached upon. “According to the existing laws, land can be released to the landless or land owners who have possessed the land before 1.08.1971 can continue its possession. However, the MLA’s land is owned by KSEB as they have not filed an affidavit affecting its release to anybody,” he added.
 
  Meanwhile, an RTI reply has further pushed the MLA to the wall, which revealed that the argument that he got the title deed of the land in a land assignment committee sitting in 2000 was false. Neither there was a meeting nor an approval order during this period, the RTI document issued by the taluk office revealed.
 
  “It is only after the approval of the land assignment committee that the government issues title deeds. But since no meeting was held in 2000 as the MLA claims, it proves that he is lying,” a revenue officer said.
 
  Meanwhile, Rajendran stuck to his arguments. “I got the title deed in 2000,” he told TOI. “I remitted the tax for the first year but in the subsequent year, the officials refused to accept the tax citing some environmental reasons. Many people face the same problem. The 8-cent land was not owned by the KSEB,” he said.
