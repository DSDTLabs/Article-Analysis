Nagpur: On the second day of three-day Rashtriya Mohd Rafi Utsav, a panel discussion was held at Neelkamal Auditorium of SCZCC on Sunday. Taking part in the discussion which revolved round the various characteristics and attributes of the singer’s personality were haematologist Ravi Wankhede, archivist Khawaja Rabbani and Kamal Sharma, an announcer at Vividh Bharti. Recounting experiences and events that have built the persona of Rafi, Dr Wankhede said that there were many who owe their success to the singer. “I got a letter from an artist Sharad Vaiko from Kolhapur who narrated how Rafi had helped him when, after finishing his bachelor in arts, he was forced to sell his artworks on the streets of Mumbai as he could not find a job. Rafi happened to see the paintings and said that he saw the traces of raga Malhar in them.”  He said, Rafi introduced Vaiko to many art lovers who bought his paintings and gave him money to set up an art gallery in Kolhapur. “When I visited Vaiko at this home in Mumbai, he took me to his puja room where a photo of Rafi had been placed. The artist said that the singer was his God.” Referring to Mohd Rafi as an era, Rabbani said that the singer had the talent to express body language of the actor for whom he was singing. “An ENT specialist had once remarked that the perfect voice for a singer would be when there is a balance between the ‘sur’ coming from the throat and the nose. Rafi was blessed with such a voice.” A diehard Rafi fan, Kamal Sharma said, “A person in Allahabad had once complained that I should be killed as I only play Rafi songs during my radio programmes. But there are many composers who have narrated so many tales of the singer’s generosity, humility and charitable nature. We are fortunate that he left behind a rich legacy of his songs for us.”  Earlier, a blood donation programme was organized to mark the 37th death anniversary of the singer.
