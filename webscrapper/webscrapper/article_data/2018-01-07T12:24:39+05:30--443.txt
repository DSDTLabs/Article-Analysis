DEHRADUN:   chief wildlife warden   complained to officials in   against Loveraj Singh Dharmshaktu , assistant commandant in   (BSF), who brought the matter of blue sheep going blind at the   to light. Dharmshaktu, a Padma Shri and a celebrated mountaineer, had spoken to the media about the issue, in late November, to which Khati now objects.

  According to sources, Khati believed Dharmshaktu’s revelation to the media had put the state in a bad light. Talking to TOI, he said, “I have complained to the higher authorities against Loveraj Singh Dharamshaktu for exposing blindness in blue sheep to the media and not to the forest officials. It is against professional ethics.” Dharmshaktu had earlier told TOI that he had informed the range officer, the then deputy director of Gangotri National Park Shravan Kumar, as well as Khati himself about the issue before talking to the media about it. The summiteer couldn’t comment as he had been advised against talking to the media by senior officials.
 
  A BSF official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Dharmshaktu should be getting rewards instead of brickbats for discovering the ailing Himalayan blue sheep.”
