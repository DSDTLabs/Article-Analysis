NEW DELHI: A 41-year-old engineer was battling for life after snatchers shot him thrice in front of his doctor wife and eight-year-old son for resisting their robbery attempt outside the BLK hospital in  's   on Tuesday night. 

 The victim, Ashok Kumar, who works in an auto company in Gurugram, was shot twice in the stomach and once in the arm. He is being treated at the hospital's ICU and is critical.
  
  
 His wife, Kirti, is a doctor at BLK and had a night duty on Tuesday. Kumar and his son had gone to the hospital with her dinner.
 
  The family was standing outside the hospital when two snatchers came on a bike and tried to take off Kumar's gold bracelet at gunpoint but couldn't pull it out. The men then snatched Kirti's gold pendant, cops said. 
 
 All this happened as traffic moved on the busy road, an eyewitness said. Police said the attackers took a sharp U-turn to escape but hit a car. Kumar chased them and caught hold of the pillion rider, which led to a scuffle and the shooting. Kirti told one of her colleagues, who spoke to TOI, that a crowd had gathered by the time Kumar chased the men and caught hold of the pillion rider. Sensing danger, the pillion rider pulled out a pistol and opened fire at Kumar in front of his family.
 
 As this while, the hospital guards posted at the gate and other passersby failed to react, witnesses said. One of them, however, called up the police at 10.30pm. A team reached the spot as the victim was being taken into BLK hospital.
 
 Police sources said one suspected snatcher had been detained and was being interrogated. Police said a case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 379 (theft) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC has been registered at the Prasad Nagar police station and a team has been formed to crack the case. Police said that several raids are being conducted.
