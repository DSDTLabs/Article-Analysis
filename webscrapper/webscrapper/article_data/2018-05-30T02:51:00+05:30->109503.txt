Visakhapatnam:   is fancying the entry of its name in the Guinness Book of World Records for having organised the Leap .

 “In terms of magnitude, mobilisation of candidates and companies, and geographical spread, we think it is unheralded in the world. So, we have sent a proposal to the Guinness Book of World Records to send their representative to assess our achievement. We are not aware of their criteria but we want to give it a try. We have also sent the proposal to the Limca Book of Records,” J A Chowdary, IT Advisor to the AP government, told TOI.
 
 As on Tuesday, the last day of Leap, 3,810 aspirants were selected for various IT jobs. The drive was on in Prakasam and East Godavari districts on Tuesday. 
 
 Apita has also used high technology platforms for remote hiring like the loop reality which enables the recruiters to assess personality traits, cognitive skills and cultural fitness of candidates from remote locations. This remote assessment was done completely through VR Games.
 
 Through the Interviewbuddy platform, candidates could go through mock interviews with industry experts even before the actual interview. “Companies like Symbiosis Technology opted to use such online remote hiring technology to recruit in Vizag,” said Avradip Saha, general manager, Apita.
 
 Sixteen colleges came forward to provide venues for the recruitment initiative free of cost. Around 200 student volunteers and 100 faculty volunteers in each of the colleges were involved in Leap apart from the Apita staff.
