KOLKATA: The   have decided to raise awareness among the most vulnerable section of society —  , especially elderly women — through its ongoing Saanjhbati project. Police sources said that in the coming weeks, they will inform the elderly about their basic rights and the corresponding legal provisions they can invoke to safeguard themselves with help from cops.

 The decision came in the wake of several con cases being reported within the commissionerate where gullible seniors have fallen prey to sweet talking fraudsters. The cyberspace, about which the elderly have limited knowledge, will be one of the key focus areas. The cops plan to extensively use the audio-visual medium to drive home their point.
 
 Saanjhbati provides a direct communication platform between cops and the elderly with a meeting scheduled every fortnight.
 
 “We help out those staying alone. It is a continuous process. This time we felt that though serious offences have been largely controlled, we can try stopping cybercrimes and kepmari by teaching the elderly to stay alert on the latest crime trends,” explained a police source.
 
 Various people – from legal and IT backgrounds — are likely to be involved in the programme. “Older people face specific threats to their rights , which include basic access to health care, property and inheritance rights and access to information. Older people also sometimes face particular forms of violence and abuse. These are areas we plan to address,” a source said.
 
 DC (headquarters) Amit Jawalgir refused to answer specifics, but ascertained that: “The programme will help strengthen the police-community relationship by solving the most pressing issues surrounding the everyday life of those elders who are being forced to stay alone.”
 
 The   Police is also planning to expand its Samparka programme which is aimed at providing security to women residing in the area or visiting it.
