Known for her intense performances in films like ' ' and ' ',   now wants to dabble in a frothy rom-com. The actress, who played a supporting role laced with comedy in ' ', now wants to explore the lighter side of cinema. 

 While talking to BT, Kalki who won a National Award for her role as Laila in 'Margarita With A Straw', revealed, “It’s my dream to do a rom-com.
