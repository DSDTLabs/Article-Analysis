VADODARA: Even as he is facing felony charges,   – a Vadodara-based energy consultant, who was held at the Grand Forks County Correctional Centre for alleged bomb threat is now out of the correctional centre in United States (US). 

 Paraman, who was booked for “terrorising” at the   in the State of North Dakota on Saturday, has been released on a bond after initial court appearance on Monday. As per the conditional bond, he is presently based in Grand Forks. 
 
 Sources suggest that the next hearing of the case will be held on February 6. His US-based friends, having roots in India, are trying to extend him all possible support. 
 
 In US, Paraman, 53, is facing Class C felony charges. The charging documents submitted against him allege that he made the bomb threat at the airport out of frustration. 
 
 According to an affidavit, an airport employee informed Paraman that he would not be able to get on his 5 am flight because of overbooking. Paraman, who was on his way back to India, after a week-long business trip, became more upset when he learnt that his luggage was on the plane and that the plane had left for Minneapolis, according to US media. 
 
 The airport employee told police that Paraman had then stated “there is a bomb in the bag”, reports from US suggest. 
 
 Meanwhile, Paraman’s wife  , has got in touch with the   (MEA) and Gujarat chief minister’s office (CMO), sources close to the family suggest. 
 
 After Nair made desperate pleas to external affairs minister   and Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking their intervention for Paraman’s release, Swaraj had tweeted that she has sought a report from Indian Ambassador in US.
