HYDERABAD: Justice P   of the Hyderabad High Court served notices to the BCCI, Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) and the   (CoA) to state their stand on a petition that wants the CoA to take over the administration of   to cleanse it.

 The petition was filed by N  , president of Prakasam District Cricket Association. His counsel, Nagisetty Ravi Prasad, told the court that the ACA is trapped in a web of mismanagement and is unable to nurture professional cricket. There is no one to implement the   reforms in the ACA and the spirit of those recommendations are being killed. The ACA has become a family society and the current executive body has become defunct in terms of Lodha Committeeâ€™s recommendations.
 
 As two senior judges have been appointed as administrators for the  , the same committee can be asked to take over ACA and run it till the new byelaws suggested by the Lodha Committee are brought into ACA, the counsel said. He also sought an independent probe into the financial irregularities in the ACA. The judge issued notices to the ACA, BCCI and COA and posted the next hearing to June 11.
