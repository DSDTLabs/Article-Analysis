PATNA: The construction of boundary walls around the Bihta airbase would start in July as the   (AAI) has given its nod to Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport, Patna, JPNI director Rajender Singh Lahauria said on Tuesday. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) for that is likely to be signed between the state government and AAI in a week or two. The state building construction department will construct the walls. “We will prepare the draft of MOU with certain terms and conditions with the consent of both the parties,” Lahauria said.

 Patna district administration has acquired 126 acre land, out of which 108 acre had been handed over to AAI in March for developing a civil enclave with other utility buildings to operate commercial flights. The state government would develop amenities like a guesthouse for VIPs, a hotel and a hangar on the remaining 18 acre land. The AAI planned to ready the first block of the proposed civil enclave by mid- 2019.
 
 Lahauria said the AAI hasn’t yet decided any specific model for the Bihta civil enclave. But it will be a two-storey terminal building equipped with modern aviation facilities. The ground floor will be used for arrival and the first floor for departure of flyers. It would also have around 14-15 aircraft parking bays. “The airport office will be constructed in the basement with enough parking space of two-wheelers and four-wheelers,” he said.
 
 He said the construction work on both the Bihta civil enclave and the new terminal building at Patna airport would start simultaneously. “Our focus is to develop the Patna airport first and the construction work is likely to begin in the next four months,” Lahauria said.
 
 Sources said while bigger airplanes and probably international flights would be operated from Bihta, domestic flights with small aircraft would operate from Patna.
