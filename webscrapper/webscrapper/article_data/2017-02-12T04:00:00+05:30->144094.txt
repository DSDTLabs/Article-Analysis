Vadodara: Amid tug-of-war between two rival saffron groups, the state government on Saturday nominated five out of 15 nominees to M S University’s senate body. Beejaysinh Rathod, Rajesh Kelkar, Satyakant Shastri, Kamal Shah and Ashwin Chokshi were appointed to university’s senate body. With this, all five will retain their membership in the university’s syndicate body till the time the tenure of the current syndicate expires. 

 Rathod had already made a backdoor entry to university’s syndicate body after he was recently appointed president of MS University Students Union – a post through which he would have enjoyed a tenure of one year. With the state government nominating him to the senate body, Rathod will now have a term of five years. Kelkar, Shastri, Shah and Chokshi have been repeated as government nominees to the senate. 
 
 The decision taken by the state government caught the members of the ‘sankalan samiti’ – unawares. The samiti which comprises of members from the BJP, the RSS, the student outfit – Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad and the teacher’s outfit - Maharaja Sayajirao Vishvavidyalay Shaikshik Sangh, was hoping to have an upper-hand in government nominated seats but in the first round of nominations the saffron group, which is otherwise termed as ‘rebels’ had an edge. 
 
 It is worth mentioning here that the ‘rebel’ saffron group had already started making efforts to win over as many seats of government nominees as possible even before the ‘sankalan samiti’ could meet and discuss names of its probable candidates which it could recommend to the state government. Usually, it is based on the recommendations of the ‘sankalan samiti’ that government nominees are appointed in the senate body. But the rival saffron group had already submitted the names through MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas.
