BENGALURU: The state tourism department on Friday said the Railway Board has agreed on a revenue-sharing model for the Golden Chariot  . The department hopes that the move would help revive the struggling operations.

 Golden Chariot, the only luxury train in South India, is operated by Karnataka state tourism development corporation (KSTDC) since 2008.
 
 “...Unfortunately, the railways imposed high haulage charges on   from the very first run and since then the KSTDC has been paying all the fixed and variable haulage charges. As a result, the project had not been doing well since it inception,” a statement issued here read.
 
 It added that the tariff was also kept high due to the high operational cost and that the occupancy over past 10 years has been only 30-35%. This prompted both KSTDC and the state government to request the railways to adopt a revenue-sharing model, which was discussed during a recent meeting between tourism minister   and Railway Board chairman Ashwani Lohani.
 
 On January 31, the board issued an order to implement a revenue-sharing model for the project. “The Railway Board has approved the operation of Golden Chariot on revenue-sharing basis in the ratio of 56:44 between Indian Railways and KSTDC for 2017-18,” the statement read.
 
 Kharge said this will help the state get more tourists, including foreigners, by adopting dynamic and more affordable tariff, which will lead to higher occupancy.
 
 He also said the government and the KSTDC would make all-out efforts to market and publicise Golden Chariot. “We’ll target to achieve at least 50% occupancy in the coming years besides raisingthe number of tours from about 10 per year to more than 20,” Kharge said.
