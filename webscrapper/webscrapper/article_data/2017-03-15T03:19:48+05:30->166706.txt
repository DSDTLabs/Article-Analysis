NEW DELHI: Contrary to the views of most students on the campus, the Birsa   Phule Student’s Association ( ) alleged on Tuesday that MPhil scholar   had taken his life after facing discrimination as a Dalit.

 According to BAPSA leader Rahul Sonpimple, Muthukrishnan was passionate about the Ambedkarite agenda, even though he was not directly involved with the student group’s activities. “He often said, ‘Brother, I can’t come for the protest because I have to study a lot’,” said Sonpimple. BAPSA also claimed Muthukrishnan felt strongly about the UGC notification on admission norms for research students that had led to big protests recently.
 
 Vikas Kumar Moola, Muthukrishnan’s friend from Hyderabad Central University who joined JNU recently as a doctoral candidate, seemed to believe that the MPhil student was upset about how he was being treated. “He told me he felt alienated since no one talked to him ,” Moola said.
 
 BAPSA claimed the deceased student was worried about his supervisor. The teacher originally assigned, the student body alleged, had told Muthukrishnan, “I am done with you” because he had wanted to shift to another supervisor.
