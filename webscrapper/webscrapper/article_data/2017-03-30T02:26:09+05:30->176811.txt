MUMBAI: Making a tough busi-ness proposition to the cash-str-apped  , BMC, in its budget on Wednesday, agreed to dole out a  , but made it contingent on a slew of “stringent” measures to save costs. 

 The recommended measures include  ,  ,   to cut cost in operations and maintenance, abolishing certain subsidies to save crores of rupees and revamping the procurement policies.
 
 The   stated, “BEST has proposed to introduce bus depot automation. It will help improve work efficiency, reduce number of staffers and save establishment costs. Also, to enable passengers to know expected time of arrival of buses, BEST proposes to instal passenger information system. Both projects will be assessed by BMC and the costs will be reimbursed based on merit. A token provision of Rs 1 crore is proposed for this.”
 
 Among the other measures suggested by the BMC were rationalization of routes and staff, renegotiation of agreements based on current financial crisis, and a strict auditing and accounting policy.
 
 But a senior BEST official said, “It will not be easy to implement some of these measures as there could be stiff opposition from unions if there is any attempt for manpower reduction. Also, corporators from Shiv Sena, which has been ruling the civic administration since years, have opposed wet leasing of buses in the past.”
 
 But the budget categorically stated that all future financial assistance would be based on clear definable deliverables and the municipal body has asked the BEST management to submit a detailed action plan. 
 
 The BEST undertaking, which was unable to pay staff February salaries on time, has incurred Rs 1,062 crore losses in the transport division. “Drastic measures are required to restore the undertaking to its erstwhile position of financial robustness,” the budget said.
