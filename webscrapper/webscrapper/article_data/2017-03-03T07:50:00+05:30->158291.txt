CHANDIGARH: Nearly four days after some party MLAs had demanded the removal of   (HPCC) president   and   (CLP) leader   from their posts, the party on Thursday passed a resolution seeking disciplinary action against these MLAs.

 Terming the move of these MLAs, loyal to former chief minister  , as contrary to the party’s constitution and conventions, the HPCC has also written to the party high command, seeking disciplinary action against them. The decision was taken in a meeting of the HPCC held in Chandigarh. It was attended by Tanwar, Kiran and other office-bearers.
 
 On February 27, 12 of the party’s 17 MLAs had met at Hooda’s Chandigarh residence to chalk out a plan for ousting Tanwar and Kiran. They were expressing resentment against the registration of a case against Hooda and his MP son Deepender Hooda on a complaint filed by Tanwar.
 
 Former Haryana speaker Kuldeep Sharma, who is Ghanaur MLA, had said that the way both Hooda and his son had been framed in a false case at the behest of HPCC president was damaging for the party. “We have already conveyed our feelings to the party high command,” he had stated.
 
 Another former state speaker Raghbir Kadian, MLA from Beri, had said that the entire group of Haryana Congress MLAs was present in Delhi when the party workers clashed in September 2016, but Hooda and his son were not there. “It was merely a clash of workers. We were present. Hoodas were not even associated with it. We’ve already conveyed this to the party high command. We will join the investigations in the case,” he had added.
 
 They had also threatened to offer their resignations to the party high command if their request for change in guard in Haryana Congress was ignored.
