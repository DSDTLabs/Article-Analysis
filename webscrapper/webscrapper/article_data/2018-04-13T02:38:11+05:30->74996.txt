NEW DELHI: Almost a month after a 60-year-old man died during clashes over sharing of water in  , the victim’s 18-year-old son apparently succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday night.

 Senior police officers said Rahul died on Wednesday night. He was also injured in the fight that broke on March 17, where his father,  , had been beaten to death by his neighbours. 
 
 The fight started over filling of buckets with water from the water tanker.
 
 Confirming the death, DCP (northwest)   said that police are waiting for the postmortem report to ascertain the exact reason of death to further investigate the matter.
 
 On March 17, Rahul had reportedly asked the accused, Sunil, to allow him to fill his water bucket first as he was getting late for work. The two got into a scuffle, following which Bahadur came from his house and tried to pacify them.
 
 Sunil, along with his friends Akash, Arvind and one juvenile allegedly beat Bahadur to death. The four were later arrested.
 
 Family members said that the Rahul had been ill ever since the incident. Of late, he had been diagnosed with pain in his chest and on Wednesday evening, he complained of having difficulty in breathing. 
 
 He was taken to a nearby hospital, which referred him to elsewhere. 
 
 The family claimed that they went to two government hospitals but didn’t get a bed. By the time they reached a private hospital, the youth had died.
 
 However, the police claimed that the medico legal case filed on the day of the incident had stated that the boy had suffered simple injuries.
 
 Even after the incident, locals claimed that the shortage of drinking water has not fulfilled.
 
 “A lot of politicians from different parties came and assured us of normal supply of water but nothing has materialised so far. We are still relying on a single water tanker every day,” a resident said. The slums, with over a thousand people, has been suffering a water shortage since January.
