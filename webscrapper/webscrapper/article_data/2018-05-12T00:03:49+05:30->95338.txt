New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind   on Friday sought Prime Minister Narendra   in the   of the AAP government’s   as it was related to   and should be  . 

 In a   to Modi, Kejriwal sought an appointment with the PM and requested him to direct lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to allow the installation of CCTV cameras.
 
 The letter comes two days after the LG constituted a high-level committee to prepare the framework for the installation, a move that deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has called unconstitutional.
 
 Kejriwal claimed that the committee was formed to “stall” the project and accused the LG of playing politics. People of Delhi, the CM alleged, know that the LG is “obstructing” the good schemes of the AAP government at the behest of the Centre. 
 
 Briefing the PM about the journey of the project, Kejriwal wrote, “All the necessary formalities have been completed for the installation to begin, the budget was passed. All objections were cleared. The cabinet had also given its nod. The contract was given to the central government’s company, BEL, but suddenly LG created obstacles in the path.”
 
 Pointing out that the committee was set up without informing the elected government, Kejriwal questioned the move as the entire process was completed for the installation to start. “What will this committee do? There is only one target of the committee — to stop the CCTV project by creating obstacles.” 
 
 He also alleged that the LG had similarly “stopped” the file on mohalla clinics last year by making “wrong objections on the file”. The CM claimed that Bailjal “did not allow mohalla clinics to be set up for 1.5 years, which has stoked anger among Delhiites”. He also pointed out that the sacking of government adviser Atishi Marlena had affected the work of the education department.
