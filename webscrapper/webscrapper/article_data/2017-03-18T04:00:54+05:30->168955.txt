GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) on Friday said it would resolve all land-related issues coming in the way of Eastern Peripheral Expressway ( ) and the laying of a nine-km railway line along the dedicated freight corridor. Chief executive officer,  ,   told TOI that all issues would be resolved in the next 15 days.

 According to officials, the EPE — a crucial project conceived nearly a decade ago for decongesting roads in the national capital — has hit several roadblocks in the past, especially from farmers in the area, who were refusing to part with their lands. “As far as GNIDA is concerned, we were to release nearly Rs 33 crore for land used to carve out an interchange near Sirsa village and an underpass near Maicha village in Greater Noida along the EPE,” said Agarwal. “This amount has been approved and will soon be released to the NHAI, the agency constructing the e-way,” he said. “We have also communicated our decision to the   officials on Thursday so that work can be started soon,” he added.
 
 “Farmers have been agitating over small issues related to the land taken from them for laying the railway track along the along dedicated freight corridor alignment being constructed under the DMIC project,” the CEO said. 
 
 “These issues will be resolved in the next fortnight so that the work can commence smoothly,” he said.
