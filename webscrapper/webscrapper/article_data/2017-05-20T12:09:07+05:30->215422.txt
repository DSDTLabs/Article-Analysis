MUMBAI: Announcement by finance minister   on Friday that horse-racing will be taxed at 28 per cent under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has sent shock wave in the racing fraternity. It will have a cascading effect on betting collections and inter-venue royalties.

 A chairmen's meeting of various race club from across the country has been called next week to take stock of the situation.
 
 "There is ambiguity on whether tax on betting been has notified or not, and if there will be a separate classification for totalizator betting. A 28% tax on betting, if final, will be disastrous for Mysore and BTC, but bad for the RWITC too. The sport is going through bad times and this only hope has also got a setback," said  , head of a delegation of Indian racing's umbrella body, the Turf Authorities of India (TAI), which was given the task to meet the   and pursue it to keep taxes at lower rate.
 
 The TAI delegation met the bureaucrats and presented several facts about the industry like, racing is a sport and not a lottery. The bureaucrats were told that the average all India betting tax is 7.5%. So anything higher would be detrimental and not revenue neutral. It was also brought to their notice that a higher tax will result in a flight to illegal bookmakers. Unfortunately nothing seems to worked.
 
 "Our plea that the GST to be charged on the earning (commission) and not face value does not seem to have found favour," Jain said.
 
 At present the   pays just 4.5% tax while   (8%),   (20% but with bookmakers it is 30%), the   (25%), the   (20%), the   (currently 5% on win and 10% on other pools) and   (15%) have tax structure which is quite low as compare to the proposed 28% decided by the GST Council.
