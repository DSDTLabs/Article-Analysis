HYDERABAD: Stating that several public representatives in Telangana too should be stripped of their cabinet status on the lines of AAP MLAs in Delhi who were disqualified for holding office of profit,   leader and   A   has urged the   to take up hearing on his pending plea against the state which appointed many advisors with cabinet status. 

 Though the HC sought to know from the state authorities how it could accord cabinet minister status to its advisors a year ago, the matter did not come up for hearing again. Revanth had filed his plea in Feb 2017 as a   litigation and his counsel urged the court to take it up again. The court said it will try to take up the matter again next week.
