MUMBAI: A month after the special   court held him guilty of being party to the conspiracy behind the March 12, 1993, Mumbai bomb blasts that killed 257 and left 713 injured, Abu   has sought permission to visit a marriage registrar’s office to solemnize his wedding vows with a woman from Mumbra near Mumbai.

 Salem had first moved the marriage permission plea in August 2015. His application then had followed the woman’s plea before the TADA judge for permission to marry him. Her plea was that rumours of marriage with the gangster in 2014 had made it difficult for her to find a match and left her defamed as her name and photographs had appeared in media linking her to Salem.
 
 At that time, the court had told her that she did not require its permission to marry anyone. Two months later, Salem had requested for leave from jail to “officially give his name to the woman” and protect her name. His plea also said he would not misuse the permission if sent to the registrar. His application is still pending. On Monday, Salem submitted a fresh plea to press for his request by citing two orders from Bombay and Delhi HCs in similar cases filed by other inmates. Special TADA judge G A Sanap asked   special prosecutor Deepak Salvi’s say on Salem’s plea.
