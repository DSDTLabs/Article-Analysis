LUCKNOW: Launching a scathing attack on Prime Minister  , UP chief minister   described him as the biggest liar India has ever seen as PM. Cornered by the   leadership on the issue of discrimination in extending doles in the name of welfare schemes, Akhilesh said the PM was misleading the nation by stating wrong facts as the BJP has no achievements at hand to boast of at election rallies. 

 He also lambasted Modi for his latest comment that copying in exams was an industry in itself in UP. Speaking at an election rally in Gonda on Friday, the Prime Minister said tenders are floated to bag "contracts" for allotting examination centers during the board exams so that the cheating mafia could flourish. Hitting back at the PM, Akhilesh said "Students do tend to copy sometimes". He, however, questioned Modi over his pinstripe suit with his name on it. "He (Modi) wore that Rs 15 lakh suit but copied the idea of another world leader who had worn a similar suit earlier .... and he is talking about copying," Akhilesh said.
 
 " Itna jhooth bolne wala pradhan mantri humne nahin dekha poore desh mein....Kisi ne dekha ho to bata do," (I have never seen a PM who lies .... I don't know if you have seen one)," Akhilesh said, addressing a public meeting in Sidhartnagar on Saturday. Akhilesh took on the PM for talking about discrimination in power supply during Hindu and Muslim festivals and his "Kabrastan-Shmashan" jibe. 
 
 He said the PM had levelled allegations against the   government but once he laid out facts showing no such discrimination existed, the BJP shifted the goal post. "Now they are talking about ISI threat to railway tracks...I don't know who is giving such unverified information to the PM," said Akhilesh.
