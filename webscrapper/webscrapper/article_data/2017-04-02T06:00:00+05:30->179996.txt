DHANBAD: Owners of slaughterhouses and retailers engaged in selling chicken, mutton and fish gathered outside the   office and staged a protest demanding quick issuance of licence so that they run their business. Most of the chicken, mutton or fish shops in all the blocks of the district have shut down fearing police raids.

 The protesters also submitted a memorandum at the office. Meanwhile, more than 100 applications for licence were submitted and the applicants asked the DMC authorities to allow them to sell their products till the time the licence is issued.
 
 Deepak Lala, president of Dhanbad Meat Association, said thousands of people have lost their livelihood in the district since the government crackdown against unlicensed abattoirs and meat sellers. “Enforcing such laws at such a short notice is meaningless. The authorities should have given some time to get the required licence without shutting down our business” he said. Many slaughterhouses under DMC have been registered with the Food Safety & Standard Authority of India (FSSAI), but they do not have a no-objection certificate from the municipal corporation. 
 
 Civil surgeon Chandrambika Srivastava said that FSSAI registration is sufficient for running the business in areas that do not fall under DMC, but an NOC is required for all such shops falling under the DMC jurisdiction. She added that food safety officers in all the blocks have started receiving applications in huge numbers and are working to disburse the registration certificates as soon as possible.
 
 DMC commissioner   said the department has been instructed to release NOCs within 24 hours after receiving application. He added that additional manpower will be deployed to process the applications if required.
