Ludhiana: A day after a head constable shot himself dead with his service weapon at Raikot city police station, police booked six of his kin for abetment to suicide. 

 On the basis of the suicide note recovered from Baljinder Singh, a case has been registered against his father Ajaib Singh, brothers Shamsher Singh, Sukhwinder Singh, cousin Bahadur Singh Fauji, sister Harwant Kaur and brother-in-law Balraj Singh.
 
 After taking his service weapon from the police station munshi, Baljinder, 50 — a resident of Bhundri village in Jagraon — committed suicide around 6.30pm on Thursday. His colleagues took him to a nearby hospital, where he succumbed during treatment.
 
 Jagraon deputy superintendent of police (investigation) Amandeep Singh, who holds additional charge of Raikot, said, “Baljinder had a property dispute with his family. In the suicide note, he has blamed the six for his taking the extreme step. A manhunt has been launched to arrest the accused.” 
 
 Baljinder is survived by his wife and two sons.
