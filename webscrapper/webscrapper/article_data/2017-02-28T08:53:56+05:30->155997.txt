CHANDIGARH: Accusing the   of inaction towards the preparations for wheat procurement scheduled to begin on April 1,   (AAP) wanted the   to immediately call an all-party meeting to ensure smooth procurement of the wheat crop.

 State convener of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)  , head of the manifesto committee   and president of the farmers’ wing Captain G S Kang on Monday said the incumbent government should share the detailed information on what steps have been taken for obtaining the cash credit limit (CCL) from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for wheat procurement.
 
 They said results of Punjab assembly elections would be declared on March 11 after that it would take at least one week for the formation of new government in the state, leaving very few days for making arrangements for wheat procurement. 
 
 “Adequate preparations for wheat procurement is must for the agriculture-based state, so the incumbent government must reveal what steps it took so far for the clearance of CCL to ensure that farmers should not suffer during the wheat procurement process,” they added.
 
 AAP leaders said it was a known fact that during the last procurement of paddy, farmers had to suffer as RBI had declined the same due to alleged embezzlement of food grain worth Rs 20,000 crore by the SAD-BJP government.
 
 “Now the time is ripe that Punjab governor should intervene to ensure prompt and appropriate steps by the incumbent government so that farmers don’t suffer due to malpractices of SAD-BJP government,” they said.
 
 AAP leaders assured that the party would ensure procurement of the crop within 24 hours of its arrival and payment to farmers within 72 hours of the procurement.
