COIMBATORE: The pleasant   the city has been experiencing since Thursday afternoon is likely to continue till Tuesday, say weather experts. Light and   has been predicted for the district till May 23. As a result, temperature is also likely to drop by two degrees. 

 Saturday was dominated by cloudy skies with a few peeks of sunshine and a maximum temperature of 34 degree Celsius, a rarity during the Agni Natchathiram. Weather experts attribute the drop in temperature to convectional activity that has been taking place for the past 48 hours. “The last two nights have seen lightning, heavy winds and light rainfall in many parts of the district,” said the director of the   at   Agricultural University, S Paneerselvam. 
 
 “There are chances of convectional rainfall continuing in the city till Tuesday (May 23). The district will receive around 20 to 30mm of rainfall over the next three days,” said Paneerselvam. “There will also be cloudy skies and heavy winds blowing at a speed of 15 kmph,” he said. 
 
 “The maximum temperature will hover around 33-34 degree C on some days and the minimum temperature is likely to drop to 22 degree C in the next two nights,” said Paneerselvam. 
 
 The district has received around 115mm of summer rainfall so far, compared to the expected 130mm of rainfall. “The 130mm of rainfall was predicted based on the average rainfall received during summer months,” said Paneerselvam. “We are confident of receiving the predicted rainfall in the next few days,” he said. 
 
 Summer rain is critical for farmers cultivating green manure crops to improve their soil’s chemical balance and fertility, or preparing their soil for kharif cultivation. 
 
 “It helps us save water, have our groundwater tables recharged and the wet soil makes it ideal for ploughing,” said a farmer association president, V Kandasamy. It also benefits farmers who have long-term crops like sugarcane and banana, as long as the accompanying wind does not displace them.
