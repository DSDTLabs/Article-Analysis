BENGALURU: Students from technology institutes showcased their tech-based innovations at   -Bangalore (IIM-B) on Saturday as part of the 7th edition of   Challenge Design contest. 

 Among the innovations was a wireless tracking Army jacket that can detect a soldier's location. "Our project will help track Armymen even at remote locations. The jacket with sensors will give real-time monitoring of location, altitude, body parameters and even bullet injuries," said a participant from Watumull Institute of Electronic Engineering and Computer Technology, Mumbai.
 
  Another one was a mini waste-segregation unit running on solar energy. Chaitra S from SDM Institute of Technology, Ujire, said: "Our device has electromagnetic coils that can trap metal waste. We have used air blowers to segregate dry waste from wet waste, which will get collected in the bin," she added. 
 
  A chemical analytical device to detect presence of pesticides and industrial effluents was another unique innovation. Vandana C from CMR Institute of Technology, said: "Through molecular diagnosis technique, our device will be able to detect pesticides in eatables or hazardous metals in water." 
 
  IIT Kharagpur students have come up with a device to rate sleep quality and detect body anomalies. "Our device can provide a complete analysis of sleep patterns besides monitoring heart beat and respiratory troubles like sleep apnoea," said Nitish Arora. 
 
  Other creations include a hand-wearable technology that can assist women during pregnancy and a smart automobile safety system that helps in semi-autonomous parking. The top 10 ideas will be incubated at Nadathur S Raghavan Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning at IIM-B and the teams will get get Rs 2 crore each from the government of India. Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Technology College, Coimbatore bagged the Chairman's Award.
