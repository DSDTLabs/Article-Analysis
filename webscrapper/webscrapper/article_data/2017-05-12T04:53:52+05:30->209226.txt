KOLKATA: A day after TOI reported how a   executive was harassed during a shared Ola trip to her residence in  , the app cab authorities suspended the driver after an initial probe. The authorities called up the victim Koyel Shee Mukherjee and said they will look in to the “technical glitches” of one driver having two different profiles (the app displayed the driver’s name as Samir Ghosh during the ride but as   in the receipt) and asked her to share the screen shots. The company also promised to get back to her with their findings in the next 48 hours. “I am happy they took cognizance of the incident after it appeared in the media,” said Mukherjee.

 When contacted by TOI, an Ola official said all issues “troubling the victim” have been addressed.
 
 Lalbazar officials also took note of the development. “Even if the victim does not lodge a complaint, we will emphasise on a proper background check. We’ll talk to the app cab companies on this issue. We are particularly concerned about the security of passengers,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Mukherjee had earlier written emails to Ola , which went unanswered, and tagged the firm on Facebook describing the incident. She said, “I want Ola to take action against the driver but I will go to cops if no action comes through.”
 
 The driver had not only abused Mukherjee for being asked to pick her up form her given location, but hit the “complete trip” option on the app in the port area, some 9km away form the location she entered — Nabapally on  .
 
 “I had never felt so scared and insecure. By switching off the GPS he could have taken me anywhere, did anything and even got away with his crime. After much screaming he stopped the car and I got off near   with several passengers of buses stuck in traffic came to my rescue,” said Mukherjee.
