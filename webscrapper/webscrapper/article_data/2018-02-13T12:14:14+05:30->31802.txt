Mapusa: Certain areas in and around Mapusa have been reeling under acute water scarcity over the last few days. 

 Owing to irregular water supply for past three months, irate villagers of   recently confronted the assistant engineer of public works department (PWD), Subhash Belgaonkar over the issue. They demanded the immediate transfer of the junior engineer for his inability to resolve the issue, and warned of scaling up their agitation and approaching water resources department (WRD) minister Vinod Palyekar.
 
 Residents of Khorlim and Dangui Colony of Mapusa have also been up in arms over irregular water supply for the past two weeks. They marched to the PWD office at Mapusa recently, complaining that despite promptly paying their bills, water either trickles through the taps owing to low pressure, or runs dry altogether. Consumers also questioned how water is being released to residential complexes and other commercial projects if a genuine shortage exists.
 
 Sources said that locals are of the opinion that although there is adequate water available for release, there is no planning on the part of the department concerned, while also highlighting that complaints go unattended. 
 
 Locals of several villages in Bardez have also alleged that PWD authorities in Mapusa are involved in a racket of pilfering water from the department and in turn selling it to private hotels and construction sites. They alleged that some PWD tankers take water at the filling point, but are eventually diverted elsewhere. They also claimed that private tankers have been illegally taking government water and selling to it private parties. 
 
 Local MLA and urban development minister Francis D’Souza has expressed dissatisfaction over the issue of irregular water supply. 
 
 A review meeting to discuss the water shortage in Mapusa was recently held by chief minister Manohar Parrikar in the presence of D’Souza, Mapusa Municipal Council chairperson   and other.
