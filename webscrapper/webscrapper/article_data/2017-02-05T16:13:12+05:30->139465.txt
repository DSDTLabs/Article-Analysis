 says his proudest moment as a parent is seeing his older daughter James, 2, interacting with her little sister. 

 The 'Deadpool' star and his actress wife Blake Lively share two kids, both daughter, together. 
 
 While receiving the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2017 Man of the Year award at  , the 40-year-old actor could not stop himself from praising his two little angels.
 
 "Just seeing my older daughter be so infatuated with our younger daughter, who's four months old. Seeing her kiss her and hug her and hold her, it kinda crushed me. But would put anyone else to sleep," he said. 
 
  
  
 Reynolds also appreciated actor   for insisting that he should have received an Oscar nomination for his last year released 'Deadpool'. 
 
 "It's always generous for another actor, who's in that conversation as well, to bring up someone else in that kind of light. But I wish I could say I'm surprised. But I've known   for a while and he's one of the most talented and generous actors. I was pretty touched by that," he said.
