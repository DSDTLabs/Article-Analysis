UDHAGAMANDALAM: Tension gripped residents of   after three sloth bears and a cub was spotted near a private school. 

 “The pack has been spotted in the area several times. Their presence is haunting us. As a result, we don’t go out after 6 in the evening,” said a local resident.
 
 Forest department officials, who are monitoring the movements of the animals, said pear fruit season has attracted the animals to the private land where the fruits are found in abundance. 
 
 Kotagiri forest range officer Srinivasan told TOI, “Some people have captured photos of the bears roaming in a private tea estate. But we have not spotted the animals. Now is the season of pear fruit. The bears love the fruit. Moreover, it is the season of jamoon fruits and wild berries.”
 
 “We are monitoring the movements of the bears. Public have been asked not to venture out late in the evening,” Srinivasan added. 
 
 In March, 2015, H Mathi, 50, and her husband Halan were mauled by a bear at Thottamukkai near Kotagiri. While Mathi died on the spot, Halan died on the way to a hospital. Kumar, a relative, was seriously injured when he tried to rescue Halan from the animal. Subsequently, the killer bear was shot dead the following day.
 
 Pointing out that sloth bears, Indian gaur and wild dogs are regular visitors in   but normally they don’t attack human beings, wildlife activists said the weird behaviour of wild animals especially sloth bears should be studied with the help of experts before the forest department act further.
 
 According to activists, bushes unattended in   in and around the town give shelter to animals like sloth bears. “Especially lantana bushes in the village areas are the main reason for bears sheltering in human habitat. Abandoned patta lands with bushes are also another reason,” said an activist.
