MANALI: A woman died on Friday after giving birth to a child for want of medical treatment in  , which is cut off from the rest of Himachal Pradesh due to heavy snowfall.

 A resident of Shakoli village in   in Lahaul, the woman, whose identity could not be confirmed due to poor phone connectivity, gave birth to a child after severe labour pain on Friday. 
 
 Shakoli is covered in over 100cm of snow, making it one of the worst affected villages in the district. While entire Lahaul is cut off from rest of the country since December, its internal roads are also blocked due to heavy snowfall. 
 
 The woman complained about unbearable pain after delivery. Her family members put her on a cot to take her to hospital in Udaipur, about 6 km from village. They had to walk on waist-deep layer of snow, but the woman died in the hospital.
 
 Though telephone services in the valley were completely snapped, the news of womanâ€™s death was received on late Friday night. Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner   confirmed that he has also received the news. 
 
 Lahaul has 28 panchayats with district headquarter at Keylong. Keylong and Udaipur have major hospitals of the district which are allegedly lying in a poor state for years.
