MADURAI: The trade and industrial forums in the region on Wednesday welcomed the   presented by finance minister  .

 ‘We are grateful to the finance minister for increasing the turnover limit for presumptive taxation from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore, which will benefit many small scale businessmen and industries. We hail the proposal to reduce the income tax rate for smaller companies with annual turnover up to Rs 50 crore to 25%. It would encourage firms to migrate to company format. An unprecedented allotment of Rs 3,96,135 crore for export infrastructures is bound to substantially boost our exports,”   observed.
 
 The Madurai District Tiny & Small Scale Industries Association (MADITSSIA) welcomed the move of allocating Rs 2,500 crore for industrial skill development and lauded the exemption of income tax to budding entrepreneurs starting their ventures under the   initiative. The association also hailed the government for setting aside Rs 10lakh crore for agricultural credit. 
 
 The Tamil Nadu Foodgrains Merchants Association Limited hailed the initiative of digitalisation by taking Internet facilities to 1.5 lakh villages. “Once GST (Goods and Service Tax) is implemented, computer-aided transaction becomes imperative. We appreciate fund allocation to improve rural infrastructure. Allocating seed capital of Rs 5,000 crore for drip irrigation through NABARD and loans to the tune of Rs 2.44 lakh crore to small scale industries will be beneficial to the region,” it observed. 
 
 However, various associations expressed apprehension over not increasing the cap on income tax of individuals. “Enhancing the exemption limit to Rs 5. lakh and levy of 10% tax upto Rs 10 lakh income and 20% tax upto Rs 20 lakh income would have put more money in the hands of the consumers and increased the demand for consumer goods and offset the slackness faced by trade and industry on account of demonetisation,” a representative told TOI.
