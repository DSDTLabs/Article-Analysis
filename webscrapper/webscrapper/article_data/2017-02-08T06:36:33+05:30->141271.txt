BENGALURU: Delhi chief minister   made another visit to the   institute on   on Tuesday. However, it wasn't his cough but high   which brought him back to the centre. 

  Chief medical officer Dr   said he will undergo blood tests on Wednesday. "I think he had a hectic schedule during the election campaign due to which he could not practise yoga and other exercises. This led to an increase in his blood sugar levels. He will undergo hydropathy and mud therapy for 15 days," she said. 
 
  Delhi CM's previous visits 
 
  Kejriwal had first visited the naturopathy centre in 2015 after the Delhi elections to treat his chronic cough. He was given a 10-day treatment to detoxify himself through mud pack, eye pack, enema, steam, massages and acupuncture. His second visit was in January 2016. 
 
  Prithvi Reddy, AAP convener, Bengaluru, accompanied the Delhi CM from the airport to the institute. "After his throat surgery in Narayana Hrudalaya last September, he was advised rest. But he couldn't take rest, and the work pressure had a huge impact on his health."
