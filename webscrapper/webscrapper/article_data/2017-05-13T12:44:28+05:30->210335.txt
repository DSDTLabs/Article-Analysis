KOLKATA:   currently over   may push monsoon into the   earliest than the normal date,   said.

  This, however, may not have an impact on monsoon's onset over the Indian mainland, which begins with the rain system hitting Kerala coast around June 1. Monsoon normally hits south Andamans on May 17 and north Andaman island on May 20.
