Chennai: Why can the   government not emulate Gujarat and Bihar and introduce total  , asked the Madras high court on Saturday.

 A vacation bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice V Parthiban referred to the election manifesto released by the AIADMK before the last assembly election which stated total prohibition would be enforced in a phased manner, and said the then chief minister ordered closure of 500 retail liquor vending shops. It sought to know whether another batch of 500 shops would be closed in the state. The judges made the observations when the case of Prasanna, arrested by the Thirumullaivoyal police for having participated in an anti-liquor agitation last week, came up for further hearing. Prasanna’s counsel R Shanmugasundaram had sought his release on parole, as his mother had passed away. In view of the urgency of the issue, the bench had asked the state public prosecutor to inform prison authorities over telephone and release Prasanna on parole.
 
 On Saturday, Shanmugasundaram mentioned the matter before the judge and brought to its notice that despite the court order, Prasanna was not released from jail.
 
 A miffed bench then summoned the jail officials concerned to be personally present in court. As directed, a deputy superintendent of police appeared in court and informed the bench that Prasanna had been released at 11.30am on Friday.
 
 After the prosecutor tendered on behalf of jail officials, the bench said the prosecutor’s office improve its communicative efficiency to act swiftly during emergency. The bench had on Friday itself quashed the agitation case, thereby paving the way for the release of all the accused, including Prasanna, who participated against reopening of a Tasmac shop in the locality.
