LUCKNOW: The students’ wing of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ), is likely to send a fact-finding committee to probe   clashes. The matter will be discussed at length in the ABVP’s national executive council meeting scheduled in Lucknow from May 29 to 31.

 Earlier this month, two people were killed and over two dozen injured in clashes between two communities in Saharanpur. 
 
 According to ABVP’s national general secretary Vinay Bidre, Saharanpur violence was a political issue but was given a casteist colour. “We have send our teams to various places in the past. We will also send a team to Saharanpur to probe the cause of violence. The issue will be taken up in our meeting and a resolution will also be passed on the discussions,” Bidre said.
