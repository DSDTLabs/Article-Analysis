Vadodara: Work will kick off on the botanical garden at Gotri pond in the city. While the pond has been spruced up, the work on the garden itself was awaiting a nod from the standing committee of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).

 The botanical garden which will be the first of its kind in the city, it has been planned on the land where the Ramdevnagar settlement once existed. The settlement was razed in a major razing drive by VMC amidst criticism as it had earlier been developed as a model slum with contributions from those living there.
 
 The civic body will be spending Rs 4.73 crore on the work to prepare the area for the garden including civil work. The work related to horticulture and plantation at the garden will be taken up separately.
 
 According to a proposal put before the standing committee of the civic body, the lowest bid for the work was Rs 5.04crore. After negotiation, the contractor agreed to do the work for Rs 4.73crore.
