Pune: Ready to claim the roads across continents, two  , including one from the city, will travel around 50   on their bikes.

 One of them is a city-based fashion designer and retail marketer  , while the other is photographer   from Mumbai.
 
 The two motorcyclists will set off on their journey on March 15, and will spend close to one-and-a-half years on the road, passing through   countries around all continents. The ride is titled ‘Ride To Be One’. Trivedi and Yazarloo will be the second group of riders in the world to attempt the feat.
 
 Yazarloo, who has already backpacked through as many as 67 countries, is also the founder of the first women-only superbike owners’ club.
 
 Trivedi had also conducted a pan-India ride in 2016 to showcase the advantage of going cashless, right after the government’s demonetisation announcement.
 
 Trivedi told TOI that the main purpose of the ride was to understand the culture of the various tribes across the world. 
 
 “We want see how they have remained self-sufficient over such a long time, what their children think of their world, and try to understand their individual culture,” he said.
 
 The riders will begin the trip from Pune on March 15.
