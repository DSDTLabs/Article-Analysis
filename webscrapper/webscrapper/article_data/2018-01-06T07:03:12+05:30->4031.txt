NEW DELHI: Ending a 70-year-old bar, the Delhi high court on Friday threw open a career in the   (TA) for women.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice C   quashed an advertisement issued by the government imposing a blanket bar on appointment of women to both departmental and non-departmental battalions of TA.
 
 The   said the restrictions fail the test of constitutional validity and are “without any credible, reasonable or compelling justification for imposing such restrictions”, adding that the policy is “neither reasonable nor rational and has to be quashed”. It said the government “failed to show any decision of policy, let alone binding policy, enabling them to deny opportunity to the women to serve in all units of TA”. It pointed out that even as per the brochure printed and circulated by TA, all gainfully employed civilians, irrespective of their gender, who are graduates between 18 to 42 years are eligible for applying for consideration for appointment.
 
 For its ruling, the HC relied upon landmark decisions of the   and Delhi HC that ended gender discrimination in film industry and the defence forces.
