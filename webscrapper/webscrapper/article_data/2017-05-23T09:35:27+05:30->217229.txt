PONDA: Work to lay out domestic piped natural gas network in   commenced on Monday at the hands of   MP Narendra Sawaikar who said that the town will be the first LPG cylinder-free town in Goa.

 The Rs 120 crore project having a network of about 300km in Goa will supply piped natural gas ( ) for domestic usage directly to the households.
 
 The project is being funded by the Centre and operated by Goa Natural Gas which is a joint venture of Gas Authority of India Ltd. (GAIL) and Bharat Petroleum Ltd.
 
 “Once the project is commissioned, LPG connections will cease and the connections will go to people having no LPG connections outside the town,” officiating chairperson of Ponda municipal council Shantaram Kolvenkar said. 
 
 Kolvenkar added that Ponda would have a PNG network of about 20 to 25km.
 
 Explaining why Ponda town was selected as a priority, Kolvenkar said Ponda is the nearest to the existing pipeline supplying gas to the Zuari plant in Mormugao. 
 
 The local consumption pipeline will be connected to the main pipeline.
 
 Goa Natural Gas has fixed a target of a year to complete the project, but the timeframe would depend on the monsoon, Kolvenkar said.
