CHENNAI: Alleging that about 45 lakh litres of groundwater is being illegally drawn daily from unauthorised borewells in   and sold at exorbitant rates to other areas of the city, a resident of the area has approached the Madras high court seeking action against the illegal practice. 

 Admitting the plea moved by A  , a vacation bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Seshasayee ordered notices to Chennai corporation and Thiruvallur district collector returnable by a week.
 
 According to the petitioner, private   suppliers have dug over 10 borewells in the area through which water is drawn out on a daily basis and at least 300 trucks of water are supplied to other areas.
 
 After a representation was made to the chief minister's cell in 2017, authorities had inspected the area and closed seven such wells, besides disconnecting electricity connections. However, within days, the wells became operational again through illegal power connection.
 
 The petitioner claimed that if the menace was not stopped immediately, it would lead to severe water scarcity in the area. Over 15,000 families in the area would be affected, he claimed.
