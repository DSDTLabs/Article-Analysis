SILCHAR: The North Cachar Hills Indigenous Students' Forum ( ) has called an indefinite rail blockade across   district from 5am on April 19 to protest against the railway authorities' alleged failure to grant compensation to those who lost their land during construction of the broad gauge line. 

 NCHISF president   said they will put up blockades in different stations across the district on the Lumding-Silchar route. He pointed out that they are protesting because   (NFR) authorities have failed to grant compensations within a specific time frame. 
 
 Kevom added NCHISF has been demanding compensation for the affected families, whose land and homes were taken away by NFR during conversion of the metre-gauge railway line to broad gauge in 2014 and 2015. 
 
 According to him, about 300 hectares of land, belonging to 500 families, was affected by the construction of the broad-gauge railway line in the hill district.
 
 Meanwhile, district administration and the police have beefed up security measures in view of the proposed rail blockade.
 
 However, NFR CPRO Pranab Jyoti Goswami said keeping in mind the proposed rail blockade by NCHISF, authorities have cancelled quite a few trains.
 
 The   passenger scheduled to leave from Guwahati on April 18 and the Silchar-Guwahati passenger scheduled to leave from Silchar on April 19 have been cancelled. 
 
 The Sealdah-Silchar  , which was scheduled to arrive in Guwahati on April 19, will be travel till Lumding. 
 
 The Kanchanjungha Express will, however, make unscheduled stops at Chaparmukh, Hojai and Lanka stations to help Haflong-bound passengers.
