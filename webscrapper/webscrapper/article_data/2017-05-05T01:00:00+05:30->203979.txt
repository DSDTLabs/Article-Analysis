 Rajput’s song ' ' from ' ', the video of which is yet to be launched, has been shot guerrilla style in public spaces all over  .

 We hear the actor had to reach the designated spots, perform his moves and make a quick exit before anyone could recognise him. The song was shot over two days and the crew was always on high alert as there were no security personnel for supervision as they would have attracted attention and the situation could have gone out of hand. 
 
 Says Sushant, “Dinesh (Vijan, director) wanted the song to have the vibe of the city. So we decided to shoot it at real locations. We figured the trick is that even before anyone realises, we have to shoot and leave the spot. Everything had to be very well planned. It was challenging but a lot of fun.”
