THANE: A group of youngsters claiming to represent the youth wing of a Dalit outfit staged a rail roko at Thane around 11.30am, demanding action against Sambhaji Bhide, president of Shivjagar Pratisthan and Milind Ekbote, executive president of Samasta Hindu Aaghadi. 

 A few protesters, said to belong to  , jumped on the tracks in front of a stationary Dombivli-CST slow train waiting to pull out of platform four.
 
 The protesters were on their way to the Thane collector's office, but decided to stage an impromptu protest at the station. "They shouted slogans, seeking stern action against Bhide and Ekbote," said a police official.
 
 The railway police moved the protesters from the tracks within minutes. The protesters -   (37), Rahul Solanki (25), Jeetendra Pawar (30) and   (32) - were taken to the RPF Thana where a case was registered against them. 
 
 A senior railway official from Mumbai said that the protest didn't have a major impact on local train operations.
