GADCHIROLI: It was the arrest of Hem Mishra on August 22, 2013, following a tip-off, that foiled Professor G N Saibaba's plans.

 He had sent a microchip with Mishra to be handed over to dreaded naxal Narmada Akka in the dense jungles of Gadchiroli.
 
 Mishra was nabbed along with   and Pandu Narote, who were with him and were acting as mediators. The three were supposed to meet with underground naxal Ramdar.
 
 Following their interrogation, cops rounded off   in Gondia and  , who acted as his courier, on September 2, 2013. After their interrogation, police zeroed on   ba, who was acting as a Naxal thinktank. But it took them about six months as he operated using pseudo names. Only after getting concrete information did Gadchiroli police nab him from his residence at   Road on May 9, 2014.
 
 From the content of the chip recovered from Mishra and hard disk recovered from Saibaba's home, their involvement in Maoist activities as well as their work in spreading their ideology was clearly established.
 
 It came to fore during investigations that Saibaba was joint secretary of the Revolutionary Democratic Front (RDF) which had open ly claimed that   was the only way of overthrowing the government.
 
 It was also established that Saibaba had links with countries like Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and his role behind Maoist support to the separate Kashmir movement was also exposed.
 
 After his arrest, Saibaba was in jail as his bail application was rejected by Justice Sunil Shukre of Nagpur bench on August 25, 2014.
 
 He was granted temporary bail by the principal bench in Mumbai led by the then chief justice, till December 30, 2015, primarily on health grounds, till it was cancelled by Justice   citing strong evidence against him.
 
 He was finally granted bail by the Supreme Court in September last year.
