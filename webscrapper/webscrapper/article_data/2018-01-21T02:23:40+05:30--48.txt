NOIDA: The  , in reply to an  , has clarified that private hospitals cannot charge   fee on the plots allotted to them. 

 However, in a clear violation of the rule, many private hospitals across the city charge a parking fee of Rs 50 to Rs 100 per day.
 
 City resident and Delhi high court advocate Ranjan Tomar had filed an RTI on the matter on December 28 last year. In its reply dated January 15, 2018, (a copy of which is with TOI), the Authority said the contract between itself and   owners does not allow the latter to charge fees for parking in or near the hospital premises. 
 
 “This means that all private hospitals across the city are illegally charging Rs 50 as one-time parking fee and Rs 100 for entire day. It is a breach of contract,” said Tomar, adding that the breach amounts to a cancellation of the lease contract by the Authority.
 
 Alok Singh, a resident of Sector 12, said: “Private hospitals across the city charge more than double the prevalent parking rate. We normally opt for parking in a designated parking zone on the road outside rather than park the vehicle inside a private hospital.” 
 
 When contacted, Chaya Malhotra, spokesperson for Metro Hospital, Sector 11, maintained that they do not charge parking fees. 
 
 Meanwhile, an official statement from Fortis hospital, Sector 62, said, “We abide and adhere by the regulations of the land and the lease agreement. A nominal fee is being charged for parking.”
