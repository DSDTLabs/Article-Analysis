After 'Gautamiputra Satakarni', actor Nandamuri   is prepping up for his next that will be helmed by maverick director  . 

 Though any further details of the project are yet to be revealed, what we got to understand is that major part of the movie will be shot in the picturesque locales of England. Puri Jagannadh is known for his penchant for foreign locations and majority of his films were shot across different countries. This time too, the director is on a roll with this new script and is reportedly all bucked up to kick start shooting.
 
 With the crazy combination as it sounds, fans of the director and actor are eager to know more about the movie's updates.
 
 The regular shooting of Balakrishna's 101 outing will go on floors very soon in Hyderabad along with a four week schedule planned in England from the second week of April.
 
 Produced by Bhavya Creations, the movie is soon going to be launched by March 9. The cast and crew are yet to be finalised.
