 is definitely a voracious reader as his well stocked library at his house will testify. In the past, he had sent DVDs of his films to 'The Alchemist' author Paulo Coelho. Now, the actor has expressed a desire to meet one of the most influential international authors, Paulo Coelho. 

  
  
 However, Paulo Coelho is a bit of a   fan himself after he watched his movie 'My Name is Khan'. In fact, the writer went as far as to say that King Khan deserved an Oscar for his performance. 
 
 
  Shah Rukh was of course flattered by such praise from such an acclaimed author and he replied that, 'Thank u so much. My next journey is to try and meet u in person. Love and health to u.'
 
  
 Considering the mutual admiration the two have for one another, their meeting definitely seems to be on the cards.
