PUNE: Opposition parties in the Pune Municipal Corporation came down heavily on the   on Friday for making ‘fancy’ promises in the 2017-18 draft civic budget.

 Corporators from different parties alleged that the standing committee has presented old projects in a new cover. Leaders from Congress, NCP and other parties also claimed that the BJP was not fair in allocating funds to areas dominated by opposition parties.
 
 “The budget is very disappointing. It has no major provisions for the future of the city. Only the names of the schemes have been changed and reintroduced,” said  , leader of the Opposition in the PMC. 
 
 “Most of the proposals, like building a new hospital, have been made without proper study. The city already has a couple of civic hospitals which are not running successfully. If a new hospital is built, who will ensure that it is managed properly?” asked Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Bhosale.
 
 The committee has presented a budget of Rs 5,912 crore, which is Rs 312 crore more than the one presented by the civic administration. 
 
 “The emphasis is on spending rather than earning. No specific steps have been proposed to improve the civic body’s financial condition. Also, the budget lacks schemes to develop the city as a tourism hub,” said MNS leader Vasant More.
