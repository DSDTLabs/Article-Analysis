Vadodara: Girl students of M S University’s Faculty of Management Studies these days are scared of even using washroom facility at their faculty. 

 For over 100-odd girl students and female staffers, the faculty has only washroom cum rest room at the ground floor of the faculty building. But a hand-written warning “Be aware of snake” posted on the door of the wash room since the last couple of days have left the female staffers and girl students scared from entering the wash room. 
 
 Sources said that recently a non-teaching staffer had noticed a snake that had curled around the broken iron grill inside the wash room after which the faculty officials were alerted about the snake’s presence. 
 
 “But instead of bringing a permanent solution to the snake menace, all that has happened is the handwritten notice which is not going to help the girls neither it will dissuade snakes from entering the premises,” said a source. 
 
 Sources said that the snake might have entered the faculty premises through the lawn waste including grass clippings that is lying unattended behind the wash room since quite some time. 
 
 When contacted professor J D Jadeja, dean of Faculty of Management Studies did confirm that a washroom attendant had noticed a snake inside the washroom.
 
 “We have time and again brought to the notice of the university’s construction division to clear the waste that is dumped behind the faculty building,” he said, adding that recently the faculty had again taken up the matter with the division ahead of the international conference that the faculty had hosted.
