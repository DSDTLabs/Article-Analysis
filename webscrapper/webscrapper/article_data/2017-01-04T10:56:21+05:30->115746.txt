CHANDIGARH: The 43 Congress MLAs’ resignations from the Punjab assembly over the Satluj-Yamuna link (SYL) canal issue, turned into a political slugfest on Tuesday after they did not turn up in front of speaker   to confirm that they had quit as legislators.

 SAD claimed that Atwal had summoned the Congress MLAs to confirm their resignations, but they did not turn up “on instructions of Congress president Sonia Gandhi”. Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader   refuted the claims and said Atwal’s office did not send a formal communication to them for appearing before him personally. “There is no question of any rethink on resigning from the assembly. The fact that the party (Congress) has missed two sessions of the assembly confirms that there is no turning back,” he said. 
 
 Punjab assembly speaker Atwal could not be contacted for comment. 
 
 SAD spokesperson Manjinder Singh Sirsa said it had become clear that “Punjab Congress legislators had bowed to Sonia’s diktat and were not pressing for their resignations”. “Sonia has instructed them not to create a hue and cry over river waters or SYL, as that would adversely affect the party’s prospects in neighbouring states,” he claimed. 
 
 He claimed that speculations that Congress legislators were deferring their meeting with speaker as they did not want to lose their perks were “absurd” and “erroneous”. “These perks are just peanuts for the rich legislators,” he said.
 
 The Congress MLAs had tendered their resignations in protest over Supreme Court ruling against Punjab on the SYL issue on November 11.   president   had resigned from the Lok Sabha over the issue.
 
 Sources said Atwal had called the MLAs to his office between December 20 and 22 too, but they did not go.
