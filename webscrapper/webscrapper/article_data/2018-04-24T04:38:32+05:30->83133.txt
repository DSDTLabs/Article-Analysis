MUMBAI: Ever since the chief minister’s medical relief fund was set up five decades ago, the highest   from it has taken place in the last three years under chief minister Devendra  .

 A bureaucrat said that in 2014-15, the disbursal was just about Rs 2.8 crore, while in the last financial year 16,913 patients received over Rs 159 crore, a 57-fold rise. The rise began in 2015-16, when nearly Rs 35 crore was given to 4,867 patients. In 2016-17, nearly Rs 146 crore was given to 13,146 patients.
 
 Overall, in the last three financial years, over Rs 340 crore was released to over 34,900 patients out of 51,428 applications.
 
 The bureaucrat said that on taking charge Fadnavis had found that the maximum amount available under the fund was a mere Rs 25,000. “Fadnavis felt that it was a meagre amount, particularly for a patient suffering from an ailment of the heart or the liver. In his first review meeting, the amount for these ailments was enhanced to Rs 3 lakh. We ensure that the amount is released within a week of the date of application. If there is urgency, then funds are released on the same day,” he said.
 
  The official said the procedure had been simplified and those with an annual income under Rs 1 lakh were eligible.
