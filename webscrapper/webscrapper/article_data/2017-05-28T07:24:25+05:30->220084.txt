HYDERABAD: With the roads around many sprawling office spaces in   gridlocked during peak hours,   are now calling for better   in the tech hub.

 Krishna Yedula, joint secretary, projects, and head of the   forum of Society for   (SCSC) blamed the ‘poor traffic management’ at the IIIT junction for the traffic chaos.
 
 “The traffic situation is not likely to improve if the width of roads at major junctions is not increased. One of the major points of congestion is the IIIT junction in Gachibowli, which witnesses a heavy volume of traffic at all times of the day. If the traffic flows smoothly here, there would be no congestion around IT parks,” said Yedula.
 
 Among the demands of the traffic forum are wider junctions and removal of encroachments on the road, mainly the food trucks that can be seen lined outside most IT parks.
 
 “There is always congestion at the exit point of   Cybercity due to the large number of food stalls and trucks parked outside. Cabs halting on this road and holding up traffic is also a common sight. In spite of making several appeals to the Cyberabad traffic cops and the GHMC, nothing has been done to create more road space outside the IT park,” said Venu Goud, head of operations at DLF Cybercity, which houses 24 companies and sees an average of 12,000 cars and 9,000 two-wheelers making their way in and out on a daily basis.
 
 The flyover construction work that is being carried out as part of the Strategic Road Development Project (SRDP) at many parts of the IT hub has only worsened traffic chaos.
 
 “There is a road that runs parallel to the Cyber-Towers – Gachibowli stretch and can be used to access Raheja Mindspace. If the traffic police takes adequate measures to open this stretch, the traffic situation might improve,” suggested Balaji B, assistant manager of operations at Raheja Mindspace.
