SURAT: Around 100 to 150 passengers had to spend night inside the coach at the Surat railway station after the   passenger train left the station without joining the coach late Thursday night. 

 Sources said that an extra coach is attached to the   passenger train from  , for the passengers travelling towards Mumbai. The boogie detached from the Surat-Bhusaval passenger is then joined with the Ahmedabad-Mumbai passenger at the platform number 4 at about 9:30 pm. 
 
 On Thursday, the Surat-Bhusaval passenger train arrived around two hours late at Surat and the Ahmedabad-Mumbai passenger started its onward journey to Mumbai without the additional coach. 
 
 The passengers in the coach, after learning that the Ahmedabad-Mumbai passenger train has already left the station, went to the station master’s office to vent their ire. However, the station master informed them about the late arrival of Surat-Bhusaval train and that the Ahmedabad-Mumbai passenger train left on its scheduled departure from the station. 
 
 Sources said that the passengers in the coach had to spend entire night on the Surat railway station and that the coach was then attached to   train, which departed the station at about 4:30 am on Friday. 
 
 “We can’t halt the train with more than 14 boogies, just to wait for a single coach. The Surat-Bhusaval train was late and there was no option but to release the Ahmedabad-Mumbai passenger train on time,” said a railway officer.
