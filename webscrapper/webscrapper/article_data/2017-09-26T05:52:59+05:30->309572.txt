MUMBAI: BJP   member   on Monday skipped the crucial meeting of the party's national executive in Delhi, saying he was unable to attend as he was busy in his constituency , BhandaraGondia.In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Patole was elected from the   constituency; he defeated NCP nominee   by a huge margin.“I have a lot of work in my constituency , I have to tackle problems faced by farmers, therefore I did not attend the Delhi executive committee meeting.If I receive a show-cause notice, I will reply to it appropriately,“ Patole said.

 Patole has been at loggerheads with the Narendra Modiled NDA government as well as the state government led by  , particularly over the tackling of drought, farmers' suicides and the agra rian crisis. “I had taken it (the subject) up with Fadnavis, but I am not happy over the manner in which he was dealing with the loan waiver row and the agrarian crisis. If Fadnavis fails to resolve it, I will not hesitate to quit,“ Patole said.
 
 Patole said it was time Fadnavis explained to the people as to how the figure of 89 lakh farmers as loan waiver beneficiaries was arrived at in view of different statements made by revenue minister Chandrakant Patil and farmers' leader Kishore Tiwari (Tiwari has been given the rank of minister of state). “There appears to be confusion at all levels and...farmers are taken for a ride. Since Fadnavis has declared that loans will be waived before  , I am sure the CM is serious about it,“ Patole said.
 
 But Patole said that prima facie, it appeared that the Fadnavis government had failed to halt farmers' suicides. “The CM did announce a loan waiver, but there was no end to suicides,“ he said.
