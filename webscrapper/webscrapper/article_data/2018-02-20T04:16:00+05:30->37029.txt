Vadodara: Notorious bootlegger Lalji Rabari, who had been evading arrest in several cases of prohibition, filed for anticipatory bail in the sessions court in one of the cases registered against him at Wadi police station last month.

 The prevention of crime branch (PCB) of city police had raided slums near Idgah Maidan in Wadi area and had found Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 2,800. They had then booked Rabari in connection with the seizure.
 
 Rabari in his bail application stated that the police have not found any evidence which proves that he has involvement in the case. The investigating officer has been visiting his place to threaten him of arrest and if Rabari will be arrested, the police will physically and mentally torture him, the application stated. He also told the court that he owns several properties in the city and therefore it is unlikely he will run away if given bail. Rabariâ€™s application will come up for hearing before the court on Tuesday.
 
 Before the PCB booked him last month, he was detained by Wadi police under PASA days before state assembly polls. Police sources said he was sent to Bhuj jail under detention and after being released from there he again started bootlegging activities.
