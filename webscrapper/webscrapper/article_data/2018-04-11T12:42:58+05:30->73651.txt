VADODARA: For the first time, the   ( ) has offered alternate space to compensate those who lost their shops almost completely in its razing drive. 

 The civic body had conducted extensive razing to clear road lines in the old city areas and had offered only floor-space index (FSI) or transferable development rights ( ).
 
 The razing was conducted on the road from   to   Market. The civic body had cleared a road line in the area to ease traffic movement. The process of clearing road lines was taken up as a part of the Smart City initiatives of the VMC.
 
 Against the portion of property that those possessing properties there lost, the civic body had decided to give FSI or TDR. A proposal in this regard was prepared and was also cleared by the general board of the civic body a year back.
 
 The VMC was, however, approached by a shopkeeper after only 10% of his shop had remained after the razing drive. The FSI or TDR would have been useless for him as he would lose his employment and shop as the space remaining after the demolition was not sufficient to construct a new shop.
 
 The VMC has proposed that in such cases, the civic body should give shops to the persons in the   (PMAY) projects. The shops would be swapped against the land acquired by the VMC by deciding the price.
 
 The civic body had been drawing a lot of flak since its razing drive regarding such cases. The opposition had also raised the issue and demanded that fair compensation should be given.
