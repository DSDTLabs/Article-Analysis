But no action was taken and we had to finally close the shop,” Devendran said. 
 
 The protestors demanded the district administration to take action against the Tasmac management for supplying liquor illegally to the shop and police personnel for failing to stop the liquor sales. The protestors filed a complaint against the liquor sellers and the police have detained two persons. Further investigation is on.
