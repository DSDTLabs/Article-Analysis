PUNE: The   police on Wednesday nabbed a hitchhiking robber who allegedly mugged Sinhagad Road resident,   (56) on Sunday , when he agreed to give him a lift.

 A criminal on police records, Sanjay Dalvi (40) of Kudale-Patil Estate on Sinhagad Road, was arrested in Yavat by a team led by sub-inspector Girish Sonawane.
 
 Kungaonkar, who runs an industrial unit in Narhe, was returning home from work on Sunday night, when he stopped at a signal on Sinhagad Road. Dalvi sought lift from him and he agreed. On the way , Dalvi threatened Kungaonkar with a sharp weapon and forced him to a secluded spot in   area in Karvenagar. He then snatched Rs 16,000 and a gold ring from the complainant, before fleeing in an autorickshaw with the keys of Kungaonkar's scooter. Following the robbery , which had cost him Rs 41,000 in total, Kungaonkar lodged a complaint.
 
 The police checked CCTV footages of the route between Sinhagad Road and Karvenagar. “In one of the footages, we saw the suspect riding pillion on Kungaonkar's scooter,“ Sonawane said. The team then showed the footage to their informers. “Based on the body language of the pillion rider, one of our informers told us he could be Dalvi, and we tracked him down,“ he added.
 
 Investigations revealed Dalvi had robbed other twowheeler riders in Kothrud, Faraskhana and Karvenagar using the same modus. He has four cases registered against him.
