Director-actor and   Kannada winner   made news last week when he attempted to commit suicide in a Facebook   video. He was rushed to the hospital and treated for the same. On Sunday, Pratham, who was discharged from KIMS hospital, spoke to us in the afternoon, and said that he was embarrassed about his act. “I apologize to everyone. I won’t repeat this mistake again. I have already personally apologized to all my near-and-dear ones,” he says. Quiz him about the reason that drove him to consider taking his own life, and he says, “I was disturbed. There was a lot of pressure on me because people tried to take advantage of me. I know that I have been doing good work. For instance, I donated my entire earnings from the Bigg Boss win. I need to focus on that.” 

 But does he realize that as a public figure he has a social responsibility and trying to commit suicide on live video sends out a wrong message to impressionable minds? “I want to refrain from talking about this episode. I know it was something I shouldn’t have done.” 
 
 Pratham, meanwhile, says that he has begun work on his new film Devarantha Manushya. “I want to concentrate on the good things in life. I have five films in the pipeline, with Devarantha Manushya currently on floors. I will be shooting all of this week and I am looking forward to entertaining people. My directorial debut, Dewravne Budu Guru, is also nearly complete,” says Pratham.
 He is now teaming up with Bigg Boss housemate Sanjana for a new weekend show. “This show will be total entertainment, which is expected of me. It is titled Sanju Mathu Naanu and I want to ensure quality viewing for audiences on weekends,” adds Pratham.
