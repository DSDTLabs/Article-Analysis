 Udyawar said their team had almost finished the shoot before the clamour against Pakistani artistes began. "I respect whatever is happening. It shouldn't be happening. But this is how it is, this is how things are. It is sad," Udyawar told . 
 
 "We had already shot most of the scenes by then, only ten days of patchwork was left. Filmmaking itself is taxing. We tried our best to finish things. We had the permission and we had to go and shoot it." 
 
 Udyawar is all praise for Adnan and Sajal, who play prominent roles in 'Mom'. While Sajal takes on the role of  's stepdaughter, Adnan will portray the 53-year-old actress' husband in Mom'. 
 
 "I had a great time working with Adnan and Sajal. It was refreshing to see them. They brought something special on screen. Sajal plays the daughter's role and there were many silent scenes in the film and she delivered them brilliantly. Adnan is a great actor. They both did a good job." 
 
 The film also features   and   and Udyawar said it was a dream come true for a director to have such a talented bunch of actors on board. "Sridevi is a fine actor and she knows what new she can get to a film. She felt an emotional connect with the idea of the film."
