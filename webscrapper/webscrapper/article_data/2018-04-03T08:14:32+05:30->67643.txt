  in 2014, were registered with any embassy in the Middle East, indicating that they had gone there with the help of illegal travel agents. This was stated by junior Union minister for external affairs   on Monday after he brought back the mortal remains of the victims from Iraq.

 
 Singh, who made his first stop in Amritsar, brought with him the remains of 38 victims as the identity of one remained inconclusive. Of these, 27 were from  , four from Himachal Pradesh and seven were from West Bengal and Bihar.
 
 Punjab government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the 27 Punjabis killed. The government also announced a job each to one family member of the victims.
 
 The minister said had the government known that the men were in danger, it would have made attempts to rescue them. "He insisted that both the state and central government should work together to stop gullible people from becoming victims of illegal travel agents. Speaking about why it took the government so long to bring back the remains, Singh said they had to tread carefully as the war was still on when they first reached Iraq. "We got a ground penetration radar with the help of the Iraqi army which revealed that human remains were buried near Badush (in northern Iraq), we got them exhumed and found 'karas' and long hair which made us believe that they could be our people," he said.
