The model-actress posted a picture on her Instagram account where she is seen sitting on a wheel chair. She met with an accident when her car crashed with a ground bumper car. Sofia has injured her knee. 

 She wrote in her post: I am at the hospital. I can't walk. :( send me healing energy. Hoping its not seriouse. I jever have accidents! I was in a fair ground bumper car and crashed and my car.

 Sofia has time and again shocked her fans with her controversial statements. She became famous after her participation in   8. However, she suddenly decided to give up everything and became a nun. In fact, she had earlier told the TimesOfIndia that she won't get married, have sex or childer. She stated, "I will never have sex, get married nor have children. Since I am the holy mother, everyone's my children. I have to look after everyone and make sure they know there is no hell. It is heaven that they are living in."
 
 But soon Sofia was back to being her sexy self in no time when her Bollywood film   released last year. She even tied the knot to Romanian interior designer   in a grand wedding in London.
 
 By landing into one controversy or the other, she has managed to keep herself in the public eye. The latest being her Swastik tattoo on feet.
 
 Get well soon Sofia.
