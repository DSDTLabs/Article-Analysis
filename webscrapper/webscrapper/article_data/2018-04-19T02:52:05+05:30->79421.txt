NAVI MUMBAI: Two stray dogs were tied up with ropes and dumped in   on Tuesday. Animal activists cut the ropes and released the two dogs. 

 "Some unidentified people dislocated the dogs from their original habitat," said activist  .
 
 A complaint has been sent animal welfare NGO, People for Animals, and other authorities. "We have also learnt that a mysterious 'dog van' does the rounds of several places in Mumbai to pick up dogs. It is likely that dogs are being illegally dumped elsewhere," said another activist.
 
 According to rules laid down by the   of India, criminal action can be taken against anyone who dislocates dogs from any area, since canines are territorial being animals and may not survive in other regions where they are dumped. -Vijay Singh
