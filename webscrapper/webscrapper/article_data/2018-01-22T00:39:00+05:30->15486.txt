Madurai: Some miscreants threw stones on the stage when DMDK leader Vijayakanth was addressing a gathering at Sivakasi in Virudhunagar district on Sunday. The meeting was held to express solidarity with fireworks manufacturers whose business and livelihood were affected by a recent Supreme Court ban on fireworks. Though there is no ban fireworks as of now, uncertainty continues and the fireworks industry is not getting much orders from north India.

 Vijayakanth stopped his speech for a few minutes when the miscreants threw stones on the stage. The stones didn’t hit him. He resumed his speech after a few minutes.
 
 Vijayakanth said the fireworks manufactured in Sivakasi were being banned on the grounds of environmental pollution while Chinese fireworks were being imported to the country. Steps should be taken to protect the livelihood of over eight lakh workers who were dependent on this industry, he added.
 
 He said the DMDK would launch a protest against the bus fare hike in Tamil Nadu. He said corruption was rampant in all departments of the state government. Vijayakanth’s wife Premalatha also addressed the gathering.
