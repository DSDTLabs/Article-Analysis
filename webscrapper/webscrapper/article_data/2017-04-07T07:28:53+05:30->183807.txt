LUCKNOW: People were a hassled lot on Thursday as several ATMs, especially those of  , remained  . While a few reported  , others failed to accept cards of other banks. 

 TOI did a reality check of a few localities on Thursday and found only a few ATMs dispensing cash. And the few ATMs operating in the city reported long queues. 
 
 Talking to ToI, bank officials said, "ATMs ran dry sooner than usual due to heavy footfall owing to Navaratra. Also, banks were closed during the weekend, followed by an off on Ashtami. This led to cash shortage at the ATMs." 
 
 Mohan Sinha of Nishatganj said, "I have been to five ATMs already, and none was dispensing cash. I need money to buy medicine. Why can't banks arrange surplus cash at ATMs in such times of crisis?" 
 
 In  , too, only the machines outside banks were dispensing money while others either had their shutters down or reported technical glitches. In one of the government bank ATMs, although there was cash, the broken touch screen made it difficult to fill in details. Sunil Singh, a resident said, "Either the ATMs are defunct or there is problem with the touch screen. Even those working are not accepting cards of other banks. How will a person get cash in such conditions when your own bank's ATM is shut while other bank ATMs are not accepting cards?
 
 Poonam Jethwani, a resident of Jopling Road, said, "I have been looking for a functional ATM in my area for last one hour. When I managed to find one near Hazratganj, I was disappointed to see a long queue. I had to drop the idea of withdrawing cash as it was difficult to stand in scorching heat outside the ATM."
