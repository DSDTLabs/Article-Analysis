BHAGALPUR: Following a directive of Patna high court, the state vigilance department has begun probe into alleged anomalies in widening of roads in   town. The high court had earlier wanted to know what prompted the road construction department (RCD) to widen the roads despite its instruction to maintain the existing road heights. 

 A vigilance team led by ASP (vigilance) Sanjay Bharti questioned RCD officials and contractors to get into the bottom of the issue. The vigilance officials also met Bhagalpur DM Adesh Titarmere and Rajesh Chandra Jha, the man who had filed public interest litigation (PIL) in the high court.
 
 The vigilance team has also summoned the then executive engineer Lalmohan Prajapati and other engineers in connection with the case. 
 
 “What action has been taken against the officers, who, in violation of the order of this court, permitted the present road to be made above the existing roads, thereby raising the height of the road in Bhagalpur town,” the high court bench had asked in its order on September 16 last year. 
 
 Petitioner Rajesh Chandra Jha said the widening of roads led to massive civic woes in the town as plinth level of houses and establishments was brought down substantially, causing waterlogging and accumulation of drain water.
