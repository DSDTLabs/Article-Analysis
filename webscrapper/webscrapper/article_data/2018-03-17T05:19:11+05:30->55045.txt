   authorities have launched a probe into the possibility of a bigger racket in fake recruitments following the   of an army clerk at the   (ARO) in   on Wednesday in an alleged bribery case. 

 The clerk is accused of taking Rs 30,000 bribe from a candidate to clear the latter's final documents.
 
 A senior   told TOI on Friday, "The clerk was under surveillance for the past few months. We had specific information that he had taken money from a candidate. We have recovered the cash from him." 
 
 He said that investigators are now probing if the clerk had a liaison with touts and agents.
 
 According to army sources, the clerk was posted with the ARO Mumbai for the past two years and his tenure was to end in a week.
 
 "Last week, he got in touch with the candidate after coming to know some changes were required in his documents," an army officer said.
 
 He said, "The clerk called the candidate on the pretext of clearing his documents and demanded Rs 30,000. The candidate delivered it to the clerk on Wednesday, a few hours before proceeding to the regimental centre for further training."
