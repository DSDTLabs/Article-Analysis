LUCKNOW:   ( ) on Thursday stoked the row over the installation of Mohammad Ali Jinnah's portrait in Aligarh Muslim University by saying that it was done to please former Indian vice-president Hamid   who visited the university on Wednesday. 

 VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal told TOI that Ansari's alignment with radical forces like Popular Front of India (PFI) is widely known. 
 
 "It is, therefore, not surprising that portrait of Jinnah was present while Ansariji was in the university," he said. Bansal also tweeted: #AMU mein jab lecture #PFI wale #Hamid Ansari ko hona tha to #AMUSU mein #Jinnah ki Tasveer to lagni hi thi... 
 
 Last year too, Ansari had invited criticism from the VHP when he had attended an event organised by the Institute of Objective Studies in association with the National Women's Front, the women's wing of PFI, in Kozhikode. The front has been on the radar of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) over its purported involvement in terror activities.
 
 Hindu Yuva Vahini, too, added fuel to the controversy by demanding that the state government to slap the National Security Act on people who have installed Jinnah's portrait on AMU campus. HYV's UP in charge, Raghvendra Singh said instead of Jinnah the university should put up photographs of BR Ambedkar and Sardar Patel. 
 
 "Jinnah was said to have offered Ambedkar the prime ministership of Pakistan if he embraced Islam. But Ambedkar didn't," Singh said.
