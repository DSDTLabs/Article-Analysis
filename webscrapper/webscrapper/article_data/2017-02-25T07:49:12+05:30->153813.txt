LUCKNOW: Supporters of Union minister   are pained over how his picture appearing with regional and state leaders in the campaign material of the   for the ongoing 2017 assembly elections. 

 Prime Minister   and BJP president   have been given bigger space in posters and hoardings while Rajnath finds space in a small portrait with state BJP chief Keshav Dev Maurya on the right side of the campaign material.
 
 "As per norm, the home minister is only after the prime minister and heads the government as number one when the prime minister is out of country or in any other emergency and to flank him with regional leaders by a section of the party is like undermining his authority and popularity in his home state," said Ramesh Lodhi of Unnao district, speaking to the ToI when Rajnath addressed a public meeting there.
 
 After the prime minister, it was Rajnath Singh who was in great demand by the BJP candidates at the party headquarters in Delhi and Lucknow for a public meeting in their constituency and in all meetings. Workers and supporters turned up in thousands to listen to the home minister, who was described by Modi at a programme in Lucknow as the "most successful home minister" of the country.
 
 In the Atal Bihari Vajpyee government, Rajnath was agricultural minister and had started kisan credit cards, so he enjoys a pro-farmer image and is popular all over the country. This time has acted tough against the left wing extremists in over a dozen states and checked the brazen killings of the para military jawans while eliminating underground outfits.
 
 During rallies in the state, people have greeted with loud cheers when Rajnath's actions to safeguard internal security of the nation and 20% reservation for females in para military forces were cited. Rajnath has been UP chief minister and the party's general secretary besides holding other positions and is connected to the party workers at grassroot.
