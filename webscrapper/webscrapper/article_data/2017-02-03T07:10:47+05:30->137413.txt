PUNE: Chief minister   has said details are being worked out for the compensation-cum-rehabilitation package for the landowners of Purandar taluka in connection with the proposed new airport.

 In response to a TOI query on the estimated time of announcement for the package, Fadnavis said, “The administration is presently working on the package.” 
 
 He, however, didn’t specify a time frame.
 
 Meanwhile, the   (MADC) is upbeat about the response they got from companies interested in preparing the detailed project report (DPR). One consultant will be finalized in the next few days.
 
 “Earlier, the MADC had extended the date of submission of applications from January 17 to 24. However, there will be no more extensions as we are happy with the response,” Patil added further.
 
 An administrative office to handle developments related to the project will come up in Saswad over the next couple of months, officials said. The MADC has already advertised for three posts.
 
 “It will take around six months for the detailed project report to be finalized,” said  , MADC chairman-cum-managing director. “The Saswad office will act as the branch office of the MADC headquarters (in Mumbai),” he said.
 
 Last week, the MADC had invited applications for three positions — joint general manager, aviation manager and executive engineer (civil). The move had caused consternation among landowners, who took issue with the move, especially as the announcement of the   package was delayed due to the election code of conduct. 
 
 According to sources, the three officers will be posted in the administrative office.
