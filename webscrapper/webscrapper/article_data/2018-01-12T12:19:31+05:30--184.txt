MUMBAI: Union minister for shipping   attacked the   on Thursday for putting roadblocks before development projects in Mumbai.

 "I have come to know that the proposal for a floating jetty at   was stayed by the high court due to the Navy's objections. Where is the navy at Malabar Hill? A mindset has developed to create roadblocks in projects," he said on the occasion of laying the foundation stone of the International Cruise Terminal at Ballard Pier.
 
  
  
 "You bring the proposal before me. We are in power and not the navy or the defence ministry. The PM has set up a committee under my chairmanship for infrastructure clearance. I will get it (the jetty) cleared... many projects get cleared by reading the agenda itself."
 
 He said the navy should secure the borders instead of raising objections to projects.
 
 "Navy people had come to seek land for housing in  . Why should I give land in South Mumbai? I will not give even an inch of land."
 
  
  
  
 The minister made the remarks in the presence of the  's chief Vice Admiral Girish Luthra.   said the Navy is needed near Pakistan. "We respect the Navy, but they should go to Pakistan and do patrolling," he said.
  
 Meanwhile, a 300-acre green zone may come on the eastern waterfront by reclaiming land off Haji Bunder near Sewri. 
 
  “The reclaimed land will only have green space and a few shops,” Gadkari said at Ballard Pier. “The reclamation can be done by using muck generated by various infrastructure projects, including the underground Metro corridor. The garden will be similar to Singapore’s Garden by the Bay.” Mumbai Port Trust chairman Sanjay Bhatia said, “The garden will be bigger than Hyde Park in London. We are yet to estimate the cost of the project.” Gadkari requested chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to bestow upon MbPT the status of special planning authority (SPA) for the redevelopment of port land. Fadnavis conceded to the request.
