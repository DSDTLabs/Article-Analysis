MADURAI: It was a memorable day for the students of a government elementary school in Tiruppalai as they had a day out to watch the circus. The kids watched an enthralling show along with the top police officers from the city on Wednesday.

 As many as 102 children were taken to the circus near their school as part of a programme promoting public-police relationship organised by the police. Madurai police commissioner   and deputy commissioner of police (law and order) V   spent some time with the kids watching the show. Seated amidst the fun and loving children, who are mostly from the lower strata of the society, the top police officers interacted with children for some time and shared some light moments with them.
 
 The children studying in the classes between one and five were taken to the venue in a police bus and dropped back at the school after the show. A few school teachers too accompanied the kids. Tallakulam assistant commissioner K Ashokan and inspector   also accompanied the children.
 
 According to city police, the activity which started on Tuesday will continue for the next 10 days, except a couple of days on Pongal. On Tuesday, students from various classes from   in the city were also taken to the circus. Similarly, 100 students from Sellur government school will watch the show on Thursday.
 
 A police officer said that it was an initiative by the city police commissioner as a part of promoting public police relationship. They expect the children to be the agents of change in building the relationship. Moreover, many of these kids of are underprivileged, whose parents can’t afford to take them there.
 
 “There is a wrong perception of police among the people and they hesitate to bring information on crime to our notice. We expect that this goodwill gesture will bring about a change in the perception,” he said.
