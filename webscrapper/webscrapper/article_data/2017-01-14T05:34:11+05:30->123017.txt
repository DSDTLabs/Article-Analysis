THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With a virtual deluge of complaints regarding harassment of students in a number of self-financing engineering colleges in the state,   is planning to set up an   for students to file their complaints directly to the university.

 According to KTU pro vice chancellor M Abdul Rahman, the university will provide an email-based exclusive facility on the   at the earliest. This is in addition to the appointment of an ombudsman for grievance redressal of students.   said they were surprised by the kind of complaints which are now coming up against college managements.
 
 However, student unions point out the lack of organisational freedom on college campuses as the main reason for the persistently uncivilized behaviour of self-financing college managements towards students. ''The government can no way play a passive role in education, both in school and higher education sector. We would ask the state government to make necessary legislation to ensure organisational freedom on all campuses. The presence of any of the mainstream student organisations would certainly work as a watch dog against the harassments now students in engineering colleges face in Kerala'', said SFI state secretary M Vijin.
 
 He added that the government and university should take active steps to ensure that a democratic body comprising elected representative of the locality and representatives of parents, teachers and students organisations should monitor the functioning of each and every self-financing college in the state.
 
 ABVP state secretary Syam Raj, an engineering graduate himself, said the government should come up with lasting solutions to the problems faced by professional college students. “Students are supposed to submit leave letters to the management if they are absent even for a day. Failure in doing so will attract fine. Every college devise their own methods of harassment in the name of discipline,“ he said.
