HYDERABAD: A trainee sub-inspector of the   (CISF) committed suicide on the   (NISA)   on Thursday. The trainee, however, did not leave any suicide note behind. After preliminary investigation, police said personal problems could be the reason for the extreme step. 

 The victim, identified as Sachin, 23, landed at NISA for training in October as a newly-recruited SI of CISF. At 9 am, a fellow trainee SI, sharing room with Sachin, returned to room number 21 of the campus boarding facility after breakfast and found the door latched from inside.
 
 As Sachin did not open the door for a long time, the worried NISA staff called on his cell phone. But he did not get any response. "Finally, the trainee SIs and NISA staff broke the door latch and entered the room. Sachin was found hanging from the ceiling fan with a bedsheet," Jawaharnagar sub-inspector (SI) S Ashok Kumar.
 
 Police were alerted about the incident and cops checked the room, but no suicide note was found. "We have checked with the roommate of Sachin and other trainees SIs. We were told that Sachin was depressed after his father Naresh Kumar's death due to illness four months ago. For the past few days, he was only talking about the future of the family. We believe that Sachin ended his life due to depression," the inspector added.
 
 Sachin went to physical training along with other trainees in the morning and returned to the room quickly after having breakfast. The trainee SI hails from Sonipat in Haryana. Despite repeated efforts, NISA inspector-general (IG) Jagbir Singh refused to comment on the incident. 
 
 A case was registered under section 174 (suspicious death) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and the body was shifted for post-mortem examination.
