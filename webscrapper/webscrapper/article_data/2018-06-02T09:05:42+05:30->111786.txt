CHANDIGARH:   leader Randeep Singh   on Friday blamed incumbent   in   for the Punjab and Haryana high court’s decision of quashing the 2014 regularization policy for the contractual and ad-hoc employees of the state government.

  said the   government neither put the entire facts before the high court nor argued the case appropriately and effectively for the such employees, which resulted in the dark future of 8,000 poor families.
 
 He said the 2014 policy made to regularize the employees during the Congress regime was not only legally sound but it also took due care of the interests of the ad hoc and contractual employees. “But the BJP government deliberately let the policy be quashed in the high court,” he alleged.
 
 Surjewala demanded that the BJP government should immediately undo its mistake by passing an ordinance for granting permanent status to the affected government staffers. “Congress understands the pain of the temporary employees of Haryana, and stands firmly with them in this hour of grief. If the BJP government does not give temporary employees their due rights, then Congress would do justice with them all when it comes in power in the state,” he said.
 
 He reminded that in 2004, the Congress government in Haryana had ensured the re-employment of 9,000 employees of various boards/corporations, who were sacked by the then Om Parkash Chautala-led INLD-BJP government, by adjusting them in different departments.
