Mohali: The child protection department of Mohali under the ‘safe school vahan policy’ has checked only 62 schools in the past nine months and issued only two   to school bus operators for not complying with the safety norms. The bus attendant was found without uniform and an expired first-aid kit. A total of 356 buses and 29 schools have been checked this year.

 Deputy commissioner Gurpreet Kaur Sapra taking serious note of slackness has ordered the child protection officer to conduct series of inspections of various schools and school buses ensuring the safety of the children. 
 
 Recently, TOI conducted reality checks and it was observed that most of the school buses plying on the roads of Mohali were either without female attendant or the male attendants were without uniforms. Most of the buses were also being driven recklessly on the roads violating the speed limits. 
 
 Sapra said, “Strict action must be taken to make buses safer for children. We need to create awareness amongst the school bus operators to get the antecedents of the drivers and attendants to be verified from the police. I have directed the child protection officer to make the checks and submit the report.”
 
 DC also issued instructions to schools that no schools staff should be allowed to use washrooms meant for school students. Also lady attendant is mandatory in every school bus ferrying school children especially girl children. DC added the instructions have been issued regarding measures to prevent child abuse cases in the district.
