Raveena Tandon, who has lent her voice for the character of Anjani, the mother of the young Hanuman in the upcoming film, ' ', is pretty vocal on   platforms about issues that are close to her heart. The actress admits that she has often been mocked by many who hit out saying that she must not have work which is why she is voicing her opinion on social issues on the platform. Raveena elaborates, “I have turned down so many films which have come my way in the recent past.

 The list includes ' ', 'Kya Kool Hai Hum', 'Gulaab Gang' and ' '. When I have said I am selective about my work, I have been mocked at on social media platforms. That’s the reason I now want to name the films which I have not chosen to do.”
