Since 2013, Lisbon-born dancer and performer   has been researching identity, sexualities and gender issues in the Indian context. His work is known to draw attention to identity issues through his character, Spicy Tutuboy. Approached to create a solo based on the theme of the American musical,  , for the Spanish Festival Vila-Real en Dansa, 2017 edition, his performance this Saturday — Spicy Tutuboy Royale — is a take on that.
Speaking about Spicy Tutuboy Royale,   says, “After being approached by the Spanish festival, I watched the movie Seven Brides For Seven Brothers again and stopped at the seven brides theme. I moved to the concept of seven rounds, which I wanted to relate to the nine rasas — something that I am researching on in  . I read about a choreographer who wrote about how in thein Korean system, sound is characterized into seven emotional states that she related to the nine rasas. That is something that I have adapted in this performance.” 
 So, the performance will have seven brides representing seven different emotional states — love, happiness, pleasure, lust, sorrow, pain and anger. “For each state, I have chosen a specific song, and each performance is around the length of the song. Each bride will be doing something different; there will be one singing bride, a bride dancing to   music, a cowboy bride, etc. I like interacting with the audience, so we will ask people to explore their senses. Also, the performance will not be restricted to a certain area — I would like to use different spaces that are not meant for performances,” Diniz signs off.
