INDORE: The Indore bench of high court on Thursday summoned district collector   to explain why the order for the removal of a temple from the garden in   area had not been issued by him. 

 In the hearing, the court had earlier asked sub divisional magistrate Sandeep Soni, to ask the collector to be present before the court in the second half of the day. However, the court later amended the directions and ordered collector to appear on Friday. 
 
 This instruction was passed during the hearing of a petition by   through advocate   alleging that many illegal constructions had come up on the green belt area of the city. The petitioner has also presented photographs of many such encroachments on green belts. 
 
 On the previous hearing, SDM Soni had told the court that there was some typographical error in the order released by them for the removal of the temple constructed in a garden at Sudama Nagar area. "The court on Thursday directed the collector to give an explanation on why he had not been able to pass the order for the removal of the temple. The collector had previously taken time thrice for passing the order. Earlier it had been said that objections to the removal of the temple had been called and were being heard," advocate  , representing the petitioner said. The petition has alleged that 1700 constructions have been done without proper permissions or illegally on government land or green belt area. With these allegations, the temple in Sudama Nagar has been given as an example by the petitioners. 
 
 IMC too has agreed that the temple is an encroachment on government land and should be removed.
