NEW DELHI: BJP   unit president and Union minister   today said news reports saying he will resign as his party's chief in Punjab are false, after meeting with the party's national president   here. 

 "All such reports are false. These are rumours," he said.
 
 After the BJP announced the names of six more candidates for the Punjab Assembly polls yesterday, it was reported that Sampla had tendered his resignation because he was displeased with the ticket distribution.
 
 However, Sampla today said the list of party candidates had his full support.
 
 Party sources said Sampla wanted the sitting MLA from Phagwara Som Parkash to be dropped in favour of a candidate of his choice.
 
 The party's Central Election Committee, which had met yesterday, overruled him following which reports appeared that he had offered to quit in protest.
 
 Amit Shah is believed to have made it clear to Sampla that the party will not take any public show of dissatisfaction lightly and asked him to campaign vigorously for the state assembly polls due on February 4.
