DEHRADUN: Chief minister   has hailed the   2018 as pro-poor and pro-farmer. Rawat said that it was “praiseworthy” that the budget had announced that the minimum support price (MSP) for notified kharif crops would be 1.5 times the cost incurred by farmers for its production.
 
  The CM added, “Promoting cluster-based agriculture has been our vision and the Union government has said that organic farming will be encouraged by Farmer Producer Organisations and   in large clusters.” Rawat also praised the move to set up an agri-market infrastructure fund with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore to develop and upgrade agricultural marketing infrastructure.
  
  The CM added that the budget was balanced. “This is a balanced budget which has something for everyone. The national health protection scheme under which Rs 5 lakh would be provided per year to 10 crore poor families is a major relief for them,” said the CM.   minister   also hailed the budget, saying that it focused on farmers and infrastructure development including roads, railways and housing for all.
  
  “Farmers in all states will benefit because the government will now give more than the minimum support price of the production cost. When it comes to minimum support pricing, such a pro-farmer decision has never been taken,” said Pant.
