 Amarinder added against the collector rate of Rs 30 lakh per acre, he had actually paid double the amount at about Rs 60 lakh. He said that his purchased land had nothing to do with Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) and he just planned to construct a small farmhouse there as he did not have a house in Chandigarh till now. He planned to plant around 32 varieties of fruit trees there, Amarinder added.

 Amarinder said he had already purchased 15 acres land in   of Mohali about 25 years ago which was subject to restrictions under PLPA. He made it clear that he would abide by all rules and regulations for any construction on the
