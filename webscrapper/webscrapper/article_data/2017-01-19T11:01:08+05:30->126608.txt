SURAT: Hundreds of commuters were stuck in   for more than an hour on   road. The   (SMC) bridge cell had closed one side of the main road for   to take up construction of the flyover bridge connecting the cable-stayed bridge on Wednesday. 

 The entire one side of the road, from Parle Point to Athwalines near Lal Bungalow, was closed for traffic on Wednesday morning. This resulted in huge traffic jam which was more than 3km of the entire stretch. Commuters, especially college students were stuck in traffic jams and those going to their offices and business places were stranded for hours. 
 
 Sources said that the civic body failed to intimate the public about the road closure for taking up the flyover construction work. 
 
 Onward traffic from Athwalines to Parle Point was diverted from the Lourdes Convent School lane towards the Lal Bungalow. However, internal lanes are so much narrow that commuters, especially car and bus drivers had to face lot of difficulties traversing. 
 
 Residents said that almost all lanes around Lourdes Convent School were clogged and chaos ruled the entire day. The most affected were school children who got stuck in the traffic in school vans and autos for long hours. Dikshit Parekh, a resident of a society near Lourdes Convent School, said, “We were surprised to see traffic jam in our lane in the morning. When we asked, we were told that the main road at Lal Bungalow is closed for vehicular traffic. The jam was so heavy that I could not move out of my house for more than three hours, waiting for the traffic to clear.”
 
 Rajesh Patel, who was going to drop his daughter at the school near Parle Point, said, “I stood in the traffic for half-an-hour without movi-ng an inch. Had SMC or police informed us earlier about the road-closure, I would have chosen another route.”
 
 Executive engineer of SMC’s bridge cell, Akshay Pandya was not available for comments as he was in a meeting.
