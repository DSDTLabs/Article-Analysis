ROHTAK: Police may have arrested the two accused in the brutal rape and murder of a 23-year old woman whose decomposed body was found near IMT, Rohtak, but the forensic department of PGIMS, Rohtak, suggests that more than two persons were involved in the act. 

 Talking to media persons here on Sunday, Dr  , head of department of forensic medicine, said that as per police inputs and autopsy report, the victim was administered some sedatives in food at an eatery and then sexually assaulted by multiple persons. He did not rule out the possibility of locals involved in the crime.   added that since the victim’s head was smashed with blunt weapons, it indicated involvement of more than two persons.
 
 Incidentally, police had problems identifying the body since the head was badly smashed and stray dogs had eaten body parts. They had initially informed the hospital that the body found was that of a mentally challenged man who died of hunger. 
 
 On the inquest paper also, they mentioned that a man’s body was found and included the same in the register at the forensic department. 
 
 Dhattarwal said, “We came to know about the case, when the media began inquiring into the matter. After examining the body, it was found to be that of a woman.” He added that the police should have handled the case with more sensitivity and responsibility.
 
 The two arrested are   and Vikas Kumar.
