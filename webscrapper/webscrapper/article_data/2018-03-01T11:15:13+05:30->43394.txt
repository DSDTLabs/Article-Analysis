PUNE: Even before March, and summer officially begins,   conditions prevailed in parts of the country, especially Maharashtra and  , with day temperatures surging beyond 37 degrees celsius in many stations on Wednesday, the last day of February. 
 
  
 Met department officials have forecast a scorching start to the summer for Maharashtra with heatwave conditions already setting in over coastal Maharashtra and Saurashtra on Wednesday and Thursday. 
  
 On Tuesday, the coastal station of   in Raigad district, about 100km from Pune, too witnessed a scorcher of a day with the maximum temperature soaring to 42 degrees C. It was the second highest February day temperature in the last eight years. On Wednesday, the maximum temperature at Bhira was 41 degrees C. 
  
 Maharashtra and Gujarat currently have the hottest places in the country. An   official told TOI that heatwave conditions were witnessed in isolated places along the Konkan coast and a few places over coastal Saurashtra on Wednesday. 
  
 These conditions may persist on Thursday after which temperatures may fall due to a change in the wind pattern, a Met official said. 
  
 “Such hot weather does not usually prevail in the coastal stations because the cool sea breeze tends to moderate the temperatures. However, the current heat wave conditions— when some coastal stations saw a temperature departure from normal by 5 degrees to 6 degrees on Wednesday—were due to a change in the wind pattern here. The prevailing wind pattern has been blocking the sea breeze,” the official added. 
  
 Mumbai (Santacruz) and Ratnagiri on Wednesday witnessed the highest day temperatures at 37.4 degrees C in the Konkan. 
  
 IMD officials said the maximum temperatures in some places were more than or equal to 37 degrees C at many places over Vidarbha, and at a few places in Gujarat, Marathwada, and at isolated places over north Konkan, north Madhya Maharashtra, among other locations.
