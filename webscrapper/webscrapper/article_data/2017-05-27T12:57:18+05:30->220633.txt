Bollywood’s favourite actor   who was recently seen in the movie ‘Hindi Medium’ highlighted a very important yet prevalent issue in our society. Despite all of us living in the new generation which is about freedom and equality, some of us fail to pressures of co-existing in a society which has different strata of the population.

 In the movie ‘Hindi Medium’, Irrfan Khan plays the character of a doting father and a husband, who goes to unbelievable extents just so he could get his daughter admitted into a prestigious school, an English medium school to be more precise.
 
 In his efforts to get his daughter’s admission, he comes across different kinds of individuals who could totally don the crown of hypocrisy. Speaking of such judgemental individuals, Irrfan Khan sends a powerful message to the fans who feed on other people's positive attitudes and have made criticism a lifestyle.
 "Bhai Sahab, Hindustan mein reh kar hindustani bhasha se pareechit na hona, ye theek hai kya? Kehne ka matlab ki jo har kisi ka case lete hain vo 'judgemental' hota hain. So stop judging others, judge karna hai toh khud ko karo. Kisi ke peeche nahi, life mein aage badho," says Irrfan in the video.
