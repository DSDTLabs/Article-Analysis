LUCKNOW: Patient attendants at   will have access to   but   inside the out-patient department block and centenary hospital soon. The   will be at least 40% cheaper than in the market. 

 This will be possible with the medical university entering into an agreement with Hindustan Lifecare Limited, a government of India-owned company working to implement the   (affordable medicines and reliable implants for treatment) Retail Pharmacy Scheme here on Wednesday. 
 
 “As many as 612 medicines listed by the health ministry would be provided through the AMRIT pharmacies. The list includes the otherwise expensive drugs for   and diabetes as well,” said Prof Narsingh Verma, faculty in charge at   media cell.
 
 The pharmacy would start dispensing medicines in three weeks. 
 
 “The process to obtain the required licence is underway. It will take some time. Very soon, medical implants will also be sold from these pharmacies,” Verma said.
 
 The company is known to dispense 195 oncology drugs, 186 cardiovascular drugs and 148 cardiac implants through AMRIT pharmacy. Doctors at KGMU said that the cost factor compels many patients to quit treatment midway and accept a disease as fate. 
 
 “The move will benefit cancer patients to a great extent. This holds true for cancer patients who have to spend anything between Rs 5 and Rs 6 lakh per year,” said Prof Ajai Singh, head of KGMU’s hospital revolving fund.
