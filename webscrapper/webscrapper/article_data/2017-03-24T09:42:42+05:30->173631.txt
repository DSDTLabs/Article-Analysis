PUNE: A group of youngsters voluntarily cleaning   were in for a shock on Sunday morning when they spotted a human skull and jaw in the bushes. 

 The group members immediately contacted the police control room and a team of the Chatushrungi police reached the spot. "We have sent the skull to the   for forensic examination to ascertain whether it was of a man or woman," said sub-inspector Vijay Koli of the Chatushrungi police.
 
 The police are yet to get the report about the skull because of the doctors' strike. "We are expecting it by Friday," Koli told TOI. 
 
 Law student  , one of the members of the group noticing the skull on Vetal Tekdi, said he and his few friends had taken up the task of cleaning the hill from January. "We assemble here on one Sunday of every month for the cleaning job," he said.
 
 Sub-inspector Koli said the skull was in the bushes a few metres away from the pathway on the hill, used by several people in the morning and evening daily. "But none of them noticed the skull covered under plastic and the waste thrown on the  ," he said.
 
 Koli said it was not possible to comment at this moment on whether the person whose skull was found was murdered or committed suicide. "There were previous cases of suicides on the hill, which came into light after months. We are probing that angle. There is also a possibility of stray dogs bringing it on the hill from somewhere else," he said.
 
 He said the big task before the police was to ascertain whether the skull was of a man or a woman. "We have given a questionnaire to the hospital because we want to know the sex, time of death and the age of the person whose skull was found. We have also asked to preserve its DNA," he said.
