GURUGRAM: A   boy died after he fell into a huge puddle next to the slum where he lived in Teekri village off Sohna road. 

 The boy, Parvesh, was playing with local kids in an empty plot behind the slum. Around 3pm, neighbours spotted a pair of slippers floating in the puddle. Suspecting that someone had drowned, they asked around if anyone could identify the slippers. One of them even waded into the puddle but didn’t find anything, said onlookers.
 
 A while later, Parvesh’s mother noticed and recognised the slippers. She started crying and lost consciousness. Hearing her cry, two men jumped into the puddle, which is almost 7 ft deep and made of sewage water flowing from the slum. They found the boy deep inside and pulled him out, and, when they saw some movement in his hands and ears, tried to resuscitate him. They carried him to a private hospital, which refused to treat the boy and sent them over to  . 
 
 Hussain, one of the neighbours who accompanied the boy, said he was still alive when they reached the private hospital. But by the time they reached Civil Hospital, doctors said he had died. Refusing a post-mortem, they then brought the body back. “We didn’t want them to tear open the little boy,” said Hussain.
 
 Residents of Central Park Resorts society, which overlooks the slum, told TOI they have made repeated complaints about the puddle, but to no avail. Rani, at whose house Parvesh’s mother Mastrina works as a domestic maid, said “the puddle was very small when we moved in two years back, but has grown to look like a pond now”.
 
 The   of Civil Hospital, Kanta Goel, said, “I’m not aware of the incident, but I’ll look into the details of the case.” The SHO of Sadar police station, under whose jurisdiction the village falls, said they were not informed of the incident by either the villagers or the hospital.
