THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state   will create history on March 8 by handing over the control of police stations across   to women personnel to commemorate International Women’s Day.

 State police chief   has asked all district police chiefs, zonal ADGPs and range IGs to hand over the control of maximum number of police stations to policewomen to symbolically portray the government policy of giving maximum importance to women safety and security.
 
 “I am not sure whether a similar initiative has been taken up anywhere. Our idea is to show the world how much women empowerment is important in police,” he said.
 
 The internal message says that not only the police stations will be headed by women for one day, but also the public interface at those stations will also be women officers.   instructed all SPs to reallocate the existing strength of policewomen in their districts accordingly for one day. “Wherever women CIs and SIs are available, they will be in charge of the police station for one day. In stations where there are more woman SIs, they may be asked to take charge at nearby stations,” the communique stated.
 
 Wherever women officers are not available, senior women civil police officers (CPO) and women CPOs will be in charge of the public interface. These include interaction with the public, looking at petitions and starting inquiries on the basis of the petitions received, under the supervision of existing station house officer. The district police chiefs have been asked to prepare a plan for the day outlining which all police stations would be under the complete control of women officers .
 
 Though the idea is to hand over the control of all stations to women, officers are not very optimistic because of immense shortage of women in the police force.
 
 As of now, there is only one woman deputy SP, 22 women CIs and 167 woman SIs in the 55,000-strong force.
