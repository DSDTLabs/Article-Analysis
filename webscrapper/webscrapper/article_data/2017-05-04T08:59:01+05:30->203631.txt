It is cited in the chargesheet that Mishra had struck a deal with Bhatt to buy his land, located at Bhanpur on the outskirts of Cuttack, for Rs 85 lakh in 2013. Even Bhatt had taken advance of Rs 45 lakh but later on he changed his mind and refused to sell the land to Mishra. Irked by it, Mishra planned the attack with an intention to threaten Bhatt.
