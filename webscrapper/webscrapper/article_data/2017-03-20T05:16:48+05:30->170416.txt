LUCKNOW: Switching sides finally paid off for political turncoats on Sunday with at least 12 MLAs, who joined the   bandwagon ahead of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, managed to find a place in Adityanath’s cabinet.

 In fact, of the 10 BSP rebels who got elected on BJP ticket this time, six have been given the ministerial berth. Also making the cut was former UP Congress chief  , who switched over to the saffron camp just before the polls and got elected from Lucknow Cantonment.
 
 Former BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya, who actually led a rebellion in the Mayawati's camp and paved way for as many as 12 MLAs switching to the BJP, was the last minute entry in the cabinet. His staff confirmed to TOI that the invitation was not received till few hours before oath was to be administered. So was the case with Dara Singh Chauhan, who switched over to BJP after being expelled from the party by   last year. 
 
 Chauhan, who is of Nonia caste from the Most Backward Class community, represented   constituency and was also BSP leader in Parliament. He joined BJP and contested from Madhuban assembly seat in Mau and won. Former Brahmin face of BSP and party RS MP Brijesh Pathak too got his share. Pathak turned rebel against Mayawati just before assembly elections and successfully contested from Lucknow central seat.   Saini and Nand Gopal Nandi, who were ministers in the Mayawati government, have become part of Yogi’s cabinet.
