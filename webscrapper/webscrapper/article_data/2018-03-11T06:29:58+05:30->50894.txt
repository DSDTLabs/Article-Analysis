KOLKATA: With only 48 hours to go before Madhyamik 2018 starts, the   on Saturday informed the 11,02,098 examinees that if caught with cellphones, calculators or electronic devices on the premises of the examination centres, their papers will be cancelled and candidates will be barred from taking any other tests. The   has also prohibited teachers and other staffers from using mobiles. They will have to be surrendered to the school head before start of exams.

 The cellphones will be kept locked and will be handed back at the end of the examination. Only four persons associated with the tests have been exempted from the restrictions.
 
 These safety steps are in addition to the earlier decision to send question papers for distribution, packed in GPS-attached envelopes, to the examination centres to eliminate all possibilities of a “leak”.
 
 On Saturday, Board president   said, “We have devised a mechanism where we will be alerted through the server any time there is a security breach and the question paper seal is broken. The question papers will be transferred to the examination centres in specially designed packets with a special sticker on it, enclosed by a seal. Only at the specified time should they be opened.”
 
 Ganguly advised candidates’ parents to take their wards to the centres in vehicles that are fit to be on the road. “Last year there were cases of cars breaking down, as well as a specific case when the steering wheel was jammed due to the poor condition of the vehicle,” he said. He also advised the students to attempt the easy questions first so as to save time.
 
 “I would also advise parents to stop putting stress on the candidates to perform well. The pressure often leads to unnecessary tension. I also request them to bring the examinees to the exam halls on time,”   said.
 
 Much like the past few years, this time, too, the number of girl examinees is more than the number of boys.
