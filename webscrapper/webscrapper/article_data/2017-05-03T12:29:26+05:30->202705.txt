GANDHINAGAR:   leaders, including state   president Bharatsinh Solanki, Shankersinh Vaghela, and others met governor O P Kohli on Tuesday and gave a memorandum over troubles faced by farmers in the state.

 The Congress party leaders wanted the governor to ensure that the state government takes steps to help farmers get electricity and fertilizer on time. The party alleged that farmers were not getting basic facilities like electricity for irrigation, fertilizers, insurance coverage and proper prices for produce. the Congress also demanded that the state government waive off debts of farmers as done during Congress-led   regime.
