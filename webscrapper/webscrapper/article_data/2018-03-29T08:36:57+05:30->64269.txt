CHANDIGARH: Congress MLA   and leader of opposition   of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) got into a verbal spat, peppered with personal attacks and abuses, on the last day of the   assembly’s budget session on Wednesday.

 Tempers ran high and objectionable words were uttered after   Gurjit took on Khaira during the zero hour. “The leader of opposition has a right to talk on topical issues, but I too want to make some points,” he said. “At least look at me,” said Gurjit to Khaira. Khaira pointed out that the   was referring to a sub-judice matter, which infuriated him. Both leaders took on each other aggressively and AAP leaders, including  , asked Khaira to calm down.
 
 Rana Gurjit allegedly hurled abuses at Khaira and he too responded in a similar fashion as the chair expunged objectionable words. “This is too much, expunge it,” said the speaker. Earlier, he asked the Congress MLA to refrain from launching personal attacks. In between, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia was also asked to speak, but Rana insisted on making a point.
 
 The speaker asked AAP legislator Amarjit Singh Sandoa to read out his Calling Attention Notice.
 
 Phoolka said, “When the session is short, zero hour should be used to raise people’s issues and not to talk about personal matters.”
 
 Later, talking to media persons, Khaira said the Justice Narang Commission report, which looked into allegations against Rana Gurjit, was intentionally tabled in the House on the concluding day of budget session to avoid a detailed discussion on it. Khaira alleged that the government was also planning to return money to persons involved in the bid, so it did not want to talk much on this issue.
 
 Manpreet attacks, SAD walks out
 
 Later, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal too launched a scathing attack on SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia. Akali MLAs trooped to the well of the House raising slogans while Manpreet was elaborating on his budget estimates. Later, SAD staged a walkout.
