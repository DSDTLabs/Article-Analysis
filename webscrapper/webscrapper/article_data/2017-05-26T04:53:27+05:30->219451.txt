LUCKNOW: Dismissing intelligence reports that indicated a link between her brother   Kumar and  , BSP chief   on Thursday shot back saying the group, as a matter of fact, is being supported by the   for political gains. Mayawati accused members of Bhim Sena, also known as Bhim Army, of wrongly claiming to be associated with the BSP and collecting money from “gullible people”. 

 She said the aim of the group was to dismantle the BSP’s attempt to bring together all caste groups. Terming the intelligence report mischievous, Mayawati said Bhim Army members were engaging in violence but were not being arrested. This indicated, she said, that the BJP was supporting the group, adding that the intelligence department producing a report was another example of misuse of government machinery. She said after Anand was elevated to the post of party vice-president, he has been meeting a lot of people, but none from Bhim Sena.
