VISAKHAPATNAM: The city police arrested the main accused in several house break-in incidents in the city as well as the buyer of stolen property on Friday and recovered 280 grams of gold ornaments out of 345 grams stolen and a 32-inch TV from their possession.

 The cops also arrested five persons including two juveniles for bike and mobile phone robberies and recovered 11 bikes from their possession. 
 
 Addressing the media, additional deputy commissioner of police ( ) S Varadaraju said that the main accused in house break-in cases, Konapureddy Naresh alias Spiderman (21) of Arilova, discontinued his studies after his father’s death and came to Vizag from Parvathipuram in Vizianagaram district. He began committing offences in 2012 and was arrested once and sent to Vizag central prison. After release in May last year, he again started commiting house break-in offences in KRM Colony, Pithapuram Colony and CBM Compound. Naresh was called spiderman as he could easily climb boundary walls and parapets to break into houses.
 
 “The cops identified him through   footage at one of the houses and was arrested at Kurupam Market Junction along with some stolen property,” he added.
 
 In another case, the two juveniles were arrested on Beach Road while they were moving suspiciously. During interrogation, the cops came to know that the juveniles have stolen 10 bikes.
