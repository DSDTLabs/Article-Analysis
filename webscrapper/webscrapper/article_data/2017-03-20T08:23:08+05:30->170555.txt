HYDERABAD: Thousands of medical aspirants in   who appeared for the   (PG) are irked over the reduction of the cut-off marks to secure a seat to various MDMS and  . While college managements have been pushing for a reduction in cut-off scores, candidates have strongly opposed the move as many believe that it is being done to encourage those seeking   seats.

 The NEET (PG) was held from December 5 to 13 in 2016.While the results were declared on January 13, counselling process has not started as yet due to ambiguity over the cut-off marks. Telangana is among other states that have been exerting pressure on the central government to reduce the cut-off score for PG   below 50 percentile. The reason being not many in-service doctors (those working in primary health centres after pursuing MBBS) have qualified for the exams.
 
 MBBS candidates who have appeared for the examination have strongly objected to the move. “Hardly 5% of those appearing for NEET (PG) are inservice doctors. It is unfair to lower the cut-off marks taking into consideration the plea of 5% candidates and make the other 95% suffer. If the cut-off marks are reduced then the quality of medical education will be affected,“ said Dr Sandeep G, an aspirant who got 4,205 rank in NEET (PG) this year. Priyanka J, who secured 7700 rank in NEET (PG), said, “As per the new rule for NEET (PG), even those who want to secure a management seat have to qualify for the exam. If the qualifying marks is reduced then those who want to secure management seats will benefit. This way , the whole purpose of having a national qualifying exam is lost.“
 
 A letter has also been submitted by junior doctors and PG aspirants from Telangana to the Union health minister JP Nadda, requesting that the qualifying score not be reduced.
