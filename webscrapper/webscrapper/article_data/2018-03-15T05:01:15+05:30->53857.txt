Navi Mumbai: The   anti-encroachment department undertook a demolition drive of unauthorised alteration done within the basement of Centre One mall in   on Wednesday. The basement of the mall was learnt to have been converted into a godown, said officials.

 “The basement area meant for parking was being used by the mall management for storing goods and as rest area for mall staff. This is the third time that action is being taken against unauthorised construction. Steel partitions were constructed for storing goods, which were removed by the administration after following the due legal process,” said Vashi ward officer Mahendrasingh Tokke. He added that multiple notices in this regard were served and there was action taken earlier as well, but the construction was restored and the area was used for purposes other than parking. 
 
 The authority present on behalf of the mall refrained from commenting.
