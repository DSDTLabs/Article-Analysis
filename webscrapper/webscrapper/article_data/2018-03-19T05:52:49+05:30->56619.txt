BATHINDA: Teachers of   (SSA),   (RMSA), computer and Adarsh schools staged a protest for regularisation of services and against the proposed pay cut for computer teachers. 

 Employees accused finance minister   and local bodies minister   of working against their interests. They also threatened to intensify the agitation if an unfavourable decision were taken in the cabinet meeting to be held on Monday. Irate employees decided to hold a state-level rally in Ludhiana on March 25 for regularisation of services.
 
 SSA/RMSA teachers' union state president   said the Manpreet-Sidhu panel of ministers has recommended regularisation of only those computer teachers who have been working at the basic salary for 12 years.
 
 Protesters who marched to Manpreet Badal's office said though the government claims that every child will be kept under the ambit of the Right To Education Act, it is victimising teachers by proposing a pay cut. 
 
 According to employees, the Union government, on March 4, 2013, directed the state government to streamline their service conditions but nothing was done.
