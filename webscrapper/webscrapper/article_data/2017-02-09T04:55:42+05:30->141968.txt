CHENNAI: Perhaps the last file that caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam cleared before his outburst against   general secretary V K Sasikala on Tuesday night was for revoking the suspension of former chief secretary  .

 The senior bureaucrat, along with geology and mines commissioner Atul Anand and six government officials in mining department and pollution control board, were suspended in August last year, on charges of alleged links in “beach sand mining” in the state. “Gnanadesikan has been appointed as director of Anna Institute of Management Studies, Greenways Road,” said a government source. The officer could not be reached for comment.
 
 The suspension of Gnanadesikan triggered widespread condemnation from the bureaucrats, who even sought an appointment with former chief minister Jayalalithaa then. Tamil Nadu IAS Officers’ Association convened an extraordinary meeting a few days later to express their displeasure over the action against the senior officer. Some 20 IAS officials met the then   P Rama Mohana Rao and adviser Sheela Balakrishnan and requested them to revoke the suspension. The suspension was, however, extended up to February.
