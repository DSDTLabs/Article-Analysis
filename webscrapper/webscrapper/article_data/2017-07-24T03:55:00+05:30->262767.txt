Nagpur: Nagpur University (NU) post-graduate admissions for science courses continue to be a big draw among students. Just like the centralized admission process (CAP), there is big rush for Gondwana University quota seats in the 11 departments that offered them. On Sunday, the common admission committee displayed the merit list showing 120 applicants for 65 seats in Group A (science). In Group B (humanities), though a similar 20% special quota has been given for Gondwana students, the committee won’t be needing to follow CAP as many seats are vacant. The panel head GS Khadekar said there were both possibilities - seats remaining vacant or wait list being prepared – as the process has got delayed late. “Around 80 students have been carried forward from the CAP held for all students. Generally, students don’t wait so long for admissions. If they fail to get admission in CAP rounds, they take admissions elsewhere and may not turn up now. Still, we are expecting that all seats will be filled.” Fee and faculty at NU’s PG department could be the major reasons why Gondwana students, mainly from Naxal-hit Gadchiroli district, may still grab the seats being offered for the first time under a special quota. Khadekar said, “Compared to affiliated colleges in Chandrapur, NU’s fee is 10 times less and for reserved category it is just Rs182. Colleges there also don’t have full time teachers while NU has no such issues.” Following direction from the chancellor C Vidyasagar Rao to vice-chancellor SP Kane, NU had reserved 20% seats each in science as well as humanities courses for Gondwana students. On Tuesday counselling and admissions will start. Between July 25 and July 27, shortlisted students will need to confirm admission by submitting the requisite documents and paying the fee. Khadekar said, “Seats under Gondwana quota won’t be filled by others if students decide not to come. The quota was in addition to our intake capacity.”
