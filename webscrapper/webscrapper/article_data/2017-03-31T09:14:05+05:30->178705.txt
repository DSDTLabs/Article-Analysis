MUMBAI:  , a  , doesn’t smile at all. On March 9, as the 18-year-old was en route to college in  , his world turned dark when he was caught between   and took the full   fired by the latter.

 "I got pellets in both my eyes and couldn’t see a thing thereafter,’’ said Yasir, who has come to Mumbai to salvage his vision. He underwent a corrective surgery in his left eye at  , Wadala, on Tuesday.
 
 `'He is lucky because he has got some vision right on the first day that the bandages were removed,’’ said retina specialist Dr S Natarajan, who used to travel to Srinagar frequently to operate on patients with pellet injuries in this latest standoff between the Indian troops and locals. Many Kashmiris, including 13-year-old Insah Malik who became a poster girl against the use of pellets, came to Mumbai for surgery.
 
 On Thursday morning, Yasir could make out shapes and light; at the distance of a couple of meters, he could even read magnified text. The pellets entered the eye and left from the retina, which is located at the posterior of the eyeball. "As there is still some clumping at the macula (a pigmented area in the centre of the retina) of his right eye, we decided to operate on that eye only on Saturday,’’ said Dr Natrajan, adding that he is hopeful Yasir will be able to see with the right eye too.
 
 Yasir is clearly upset. "I wanted to study and set up a business so that I could take good care of my parents. Now, I am apprehensive,’’ he said. "Pellets shouldn’t be used on people. There are so many youngsters like me who have lost vision because of them,’’ he said, adding that he still has pellets embedded in his cheeks and forehead. "Why can’t their use be stopped,’’ asked his father Fayaz Rah, a business man.
