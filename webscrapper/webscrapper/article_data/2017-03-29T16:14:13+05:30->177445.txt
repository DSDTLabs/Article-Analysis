Music director   is again accused of plagiarism and this time it's for his latest song,   Thedi Varum from the film, ‘Sathya’.

 The recently released song from the film with Jayaram and   in lead roles was trolled by fans on social networking pages, alleging him of lifting it from the   composition Halena Halena, in the film Iru Murugan. Interestingly, the Tamil song in itself was allegedly inspired from rapper Fetty Wap’s hit number Trap Queen.
 
 Gopi Sunder has made headlines earlier also over plagiarism for his music in Mohanlal starrer   and Bangalore Days.
