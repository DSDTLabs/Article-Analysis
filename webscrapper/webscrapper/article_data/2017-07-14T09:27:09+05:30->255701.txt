BAREILLY: On an average, two IPS officers have been transferred every day in the past 120 days in  
 
    (law and order) Aditya Mishra was replaced two months after his appointment for the top job. He was replaced by Anand Kumar, in one of several transfers since the   took over.
  
  In the past four months, 245 IPS officers have been transferred, including several top officials who have been shifted multiple times. Chief minister Adityanath's home district, Gorakhpur, has already seen two senior superintendents of police (SSPs).
  
  Saharanpur SSP Luv Kumar, who had filed a case against BJP MP Raghav Lakhanpal Sharma after the latter allegedly led a mob to storm Kumar's official residence during communal violence in Saharanpur in April, was shortly afterwards transferred to Noida.
  
  SSP (STF) Amit Pathak who was credited for the crackdown on the interstate petrol pump chip scam was transferred but later reinstated after the move was criticized. In Bareilly, SSP Jogendra Kumar was retained after BJP MLAs wrote against incoming SSP Akash Kulhari who had taken on BJP leaders during his earlier stint as SSP of the district. Kulhari was sent to the Police Training Academy in Moradabad. 
  
  With a total strength of 407 IPS officers in UP, the previous   government had given 2,454 transfer orders from March 2012 to March 2017, according to information provided to RTI activist Nutan Thakur by then IG (personnel) P C Meena.
  
  Over 10 years (2006-15), IPS officers in UP have been transferred at four times the national average, based on data with the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD). Although the rate of transfers declined by 37 per cent over this period, the average   stayed at a post for less than a year over this period.
