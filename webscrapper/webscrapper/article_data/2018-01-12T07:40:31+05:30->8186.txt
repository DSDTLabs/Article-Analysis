JAIPUR: Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said the governments at the Centre and in the state were violating model code of conduct that was in place as bypoll process was on in Rajasthan. Gehlot was reacting to reports that Centre has approved to widen the   stretch of national highway-8 by converting it into an eight-lane road from the existing six-lane one.

 “The governments at Centre and state are blatantly violating the model code of conduct and destroying democracy in the country. This is what they did recently in   elections too. Until the election commission comes forward and plays a fair role, the daring of these people (  leaders) get bolstered,” Gehlot said, while speaking to reporters at the PCC on Thursday.
 
 Later in the day,   spokesperson Pratap Singh Khachariyawas too accused the ruling BJP of violating MCC by misusing government machinery and vehicles. “In Ajmer, the ministers are freely using government vehicles and taking senior government officials along with them while campaigning for the BJP candidate,” Khachariyawas said.
 
 He added, “For the rally organised during BJP candidate’s nomination on Wednesday, transport minister   used his official powers to force private bus operators to ferry people to venue. NREGA workers were forced to attend the candidate’s rally.” The Congress spokesperson said the party would lodge a complaint with the election commission about it. “All ministers are misusing their official powers to influence voters not only in Ajmer   constituency but also in   and Mandalgarh assembly constituencies,” Khachariyawas claimed.
