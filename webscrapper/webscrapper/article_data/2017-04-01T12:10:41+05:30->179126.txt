AHMEDABAD: The   (GERC) on Friday decided not to   for 2017-18 for state-run   However, in the case of   (TPL), the GERC deferred its decision on the demand for an increase in tariff following the March 30 order of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity on the review of tariff order of GERC for the year 2016-17.

 In fact, the tariff orders of GERC entail a net benefit of 18 paise per unit to consumers with a change in power purchase cost and base FPPPA (Fuel Price and Power Purchase Agreement). “Savings to consumers will be Rs 1,257 crore on annual sales of 69,821 million units,” GERC said in a statement.
 
 In December last year, TPL had proposed a tariff increase of 31 paise per unit for Ahmedabad (including Gandhinagar) and 18 paise per unit for the Surat supply area. However, the four distribution companies affiliated to the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) had sought no increase in tariff. “The commission decided not to modify the existing tariff rates for consumers for FY 2017-18,” GERC stated with regard to the tariff petitions filed by state-run discoms. As far as tariff for 2017-18 for consumers of TPL is concerned, the GERC will decide only after issuing appropriate judgment in review petitions of tariff order dated March 31, 2016, which has been remanded back by the appellate tribunal to the state regulator.
 
 The commission directed state distribution companies to submit an action plan for the replacement of defective meters and initiate efforts for reducing fixed cost liability related to generating stations stranded due to non-availability of fuel or by the high cost of fuel, by renegotiating Power Purchase Agreements.
