BHOPAL: The   has banned the use of the word ‘Dalit’, especially in any official communication made by the government.

 The Gwalior bench of HC issued the order while hearing a PIL, which pointed out that the word ‘Dalit’ is not mentioned in our Constitution. People belonging to different categories have been termed either ‘SC’ or ‘ST’. The use of ‘Dalit’ in government documents, schemes and plans is thus against the Constitution, the PIL says. The HC ordered that only the terminologies mentioned in the Constitution should be used for official work and ‘Dalit’ should not be used in document of any government, semi-government or non-government department.
