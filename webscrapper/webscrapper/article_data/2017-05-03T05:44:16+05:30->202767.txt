LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has directed the   to look into allegations that programmes of   Nirmal Baba being broadcast on   encourage superstitions among viewers. The court added that if the allegations are true then the ministry must take action against such TV channels under the Cable Television Network Rules 1994. 

 A bench of Justice AP Sahi and Justice Sanjai Harkauli passed the order on a PIL which was filed in 2012 by K Saran. The petitioner had pleaded that the Cable Television Network Rules 1994 states that if TV channels telecast shows that encourage superstitions then the government can revoke the permission granted for running them.
 
 The bench said that since the petitioner had not made any TV channel a party in the PIL it could not pass any order against them. But during the hearing the bench found that the information and broadcasting ministry had in May 2012 referred to a complaint against   to the Secretary General of the News Broadcasters Association, the Broadcast Content Complaint Council and the Advertising Standards Council of India.
 
 The bench enquired about the action taken on the complaint but no material could be brought before it in this regard.
 
 Under the circumstances, the bench referred the provisions of the Rule 1994 and directed the I and B ministry to take action into the matter after hearing the operators, channels and other parties concerned.
