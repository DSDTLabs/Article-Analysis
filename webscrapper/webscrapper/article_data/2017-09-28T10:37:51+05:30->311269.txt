CHANDIGARH: The authorities at Burail Model Jail, Sector 51, may soon introduce 20   for its 950 inmates, an official has confirmed to TOI.   superintendent S K Jain said on Wednesday that they recently sent a proposal to the   for introducing the courses as part of National Skill Development Mission.

 The proposed courses include that of beautician, carpentry, plumbing, and repairing reserve osmosis (RO) water filters. According to the plan, once the inmates complete any of the courses, they will be awarded a certificate and given an honorarium.
 
 At present, the jail is offering just two courses to its inmates. But these are of mot much help to them, as they do not get a certificate on completion and don’t get any kind of training from professionals. Jain said the proposal was sent last week. “We are expecting the Centre to approve most of the courses we have proposed, and that they will be introduced soon,” he said.
 
 The two courses available for inmates at the jail include wood and iron furniture making, and knitting and tailoring. Because there is no certificate awarded along with the courses, they are of no use to the inmates when they leave prison. Jain said the proposal was prepared on demands made by inmates.
 
 A factory has been set up at Burail Model Jail since its inception. Wooden and iron furniture is prepared at the factory and supplied to departments of UT administration.
