 Despite the model   being in force, restaurants and eateries across North Goa need not close at 11pm.
 
  The North Goa district magistrate has granted a relaxation to shops, pubs, bars, shacks and restaurants allowing them to remain open after 11pm. They will, however, not be permitted to serve liquor.

  The relaxation was granted after the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, an association of hoteliers and other related trades, submitted a memorandum to the  .
  
  The association said that the seemingly vague notification will deal a death blow to the tourism sector, which is already suffering due to the issue.
  
  The scenario will be worse because it is the peak tourist season. It said the ban has also inconvenienced tourists, including those who reach late and are left with very few options because of the ban.
