When director   was shooting his debut film  , there were many days with packed schedules. During one such schedule, which was to be shot at a five-star hotel in the city, the team had a hectic day, forgoing breakfast and even nearly their lunch. But they soldiered on and pulled off over 35 setups in one single day, which went into midnight.

 
  
 “The last setup was at around 12.30 am, which was a simple shot of a cellphone ringing in the foreground and a quick focus shift to lead actress   as she looks back towards the camera. In front of her was a large window with the view of the dark night sky, which was also in the frame. The initial shots went awry, and in what turned out to be the last shot of the day, the set went silent as I called ‘action’. Lauren turned towards the camera as the cellphone display came on and it started ringing. The next thing we saw was a big bright   strike on the dark night sky through the window behind Lauren. It was one of the most beautiful things we had ever witnessed and the timing was spot on. After I said ‘cut’, the whole set erupted in joy as it was an incredible ending to an eventful day. The shot has been placed as is in the film and is not something any human hand can create, even with the best technology at disposal. Hence, I call it ‘the blessing’,” says Adarsh.
