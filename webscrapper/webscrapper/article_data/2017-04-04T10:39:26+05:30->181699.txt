CHANDIGARH:   have arrested a woman volunteer of   (AAP) for masterminding robberies in Panipat. The woman, Shakina, 38, also used to act as a decoy of the Haryana health department for unearthing violations of the Pre-Conception and   Act, 1994, (PNDT) under the "Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao" yojna. 

 Haryana police apprehended her for the March 29 robbery at the residence of Panipat's former mayor Bhupinder Singh following the arrest of her four accomplices -- Jisan, Aabid, Kasim and Naim, all residents of Kairana in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh. Kasim was her former colleague in a direct selling company. 
 
 Panipat SP Rahul Sharma said, "She would plan the strike after carrying out a recce.'' 
 
 The police recovered two country-made pistols of .315 calibre, six cartridges and a sharp-edged weapon from their possession.
 
 Shakina, who is from Dharbhanga in Karnataka, was residing in Sector 11 of Panipat. She is married and has two daughters.
 
 After striking at two places, the gang had planned to target the residence of deputy civil surgeon of Panipat. "They aborted their plan due to rush at the place," said a cop associated with the case.
 
 The SP said CCTV camera footage released from the former Mayor's house helped cops in identifying the accused within 48 hours. The footage was posted on social media, he added.
 
 The busting of this gang has also led to the solving of the robbery at the house of an elderly couple on October 12, 2016, the police said.
 
 Sources confirmed that Shakina was associated with the health department for past two years and had borrowed money from various doctors. She had also sought a loan from Dr Sudhir Batra, the deputy civil surgeon of Panipat, but when he refused, she hatched a plan to rob his house.
 
 AAP coordinator of Panipat Jai Parkash Garg expressed ignorance about her criminal background. â€œAccording to our women wing office-bearers, she had only attended a couple of our programmes."
