Bhopal :

 The   state cabinet meeting schedule to be held on Tuesday is likely to deliberate on two crucial issues- ban on polythene bags and transfer of land for smart city project in Bhopal.
 
 Cabinet is expected to clear the proposal for ban on polythene bags with effect from May 1 and also transfer of South T T Nagar land for the proposed Smart City Project from Bhopal Development Authority (BDA) to Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). 
 
 According to sources in Mantralaya, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had on January 26 announced a total ban on polythene bags in the state from May 1. Chouhan had said the decision was taken to protect the environment and public health. Instead of polythene which is harmful for the environment, paper and cloth will be used from May 1, Chouhan had said on the occasion of 68th Republic Day celebrations adding that the initiative was in view of cleanliness drive launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 The state government had earlier imposed ban on polythene bags in tourist destinations and holy cities of Ujjain, Amarkantak, Khajuraho, Pachmarhi, Maheshwar, Omkareshwar and Orchha, from January 1.
 
 â€‹The cabinet may also decide on the transfer of land in South T T Nagar to BMC. According to sources, the area has been selected for Smart City Project and most the departments, including the revenue department, have given clearance to the transfer of land from BDA.
 
 The Smart City area based development is proposed in 342 acres. This will be cleared by the Ministry of Urban Development.
 
 After cabinet clearance, both the cases will be referred to the state assembly and then to the Centre for further approval. The decision to ban polythene will be implemented after final approval from the home ministry and then the President's office, sources added.
