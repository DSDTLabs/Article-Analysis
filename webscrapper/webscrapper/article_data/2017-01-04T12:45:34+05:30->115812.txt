BENGALURU: The high court on Tuesday asked the   (ACB) not to give effect to the lookout notice and arrest T N  , suspended managing director of Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited (CNNL). He was found in possession of more disproportionate assets than the one detected by the I-T department last month.

 Justice   gave this direction after Chikkarayappa expressed apprehension that he might be arrested based on the lookout notice even before the special court decides on his anticipatory bail application. As per the order, the officer cannot be arrested until the special court takes a decision on his bail plea. Chikkarayappa has agreed to cooperate with the probe being undertaken by the ACB.
 
 Earlier, counsel for Chikkarayappa said only Rs 3 lakh was recovered from the house whereas the ACB claimed it is Rs 75 lakh. The agency said it had raided other premises and found wealth worth more than Rs 3.5 crore, much above his known sources of income.
