PANAJI: Taking viewers on a fictional trip through  , photographer Paulo Simao’s exhibition titled ‘Goodbye Pyongyang’ presented a disquieting reflection on the act of seeing and believing.

 Through a series of 14 photographs, recently installed at the  , Fontainhas-Panaji, his project took visitors through the locales of Europe representing them as the heavily-guarded borders of North Korea under the dictatorship of Kim Jong-Un.
 
 Shot in Spain and Netherlands, the project which started as an   album with 31 pictures, gained immense response on Simao’s account urging him to exhibit 14 of them. From Goa, the   has travelled to Rajasthan to be a part of a photo festival in Jaipur.
 
 Simao could not accompany the exhibit to Goa but through his pictures, gives a peak into what he perceives North Korea could be, given the restricted access to the country.
 
 One of the pictures is of a Mongoloid woman dressed in a military suit with her hair tucked tightly into her cap. She appears to be biting into an apple that is loosely clutched in her fingers but her eyes speak of an unknown fear as she stares into oblivion. In another picture, Kim Jong-Un’s photograph hangs on a building; and a Korean newspaper sticks out of a fence in yet another photograph.
 
 “There is a lot of research gone into this as the objects are symbolic of North Korea. Through the pictures, Simao means to create an illusion and enforce an idea of what people would believe as truth,” said director of Fundcao Oriente, Maria Ines Figueira.
