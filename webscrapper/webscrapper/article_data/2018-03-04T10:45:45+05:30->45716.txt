VADODARA: Parents of the 13-year-old kid Het Chauhan, who lost his life in road accident last Sunday while he was on his way to attend a cycle marathon organised by his school Jai Ambe, approached   on Saturday demanding action against the school management. 

 The parents along with Vadodara Parents’ Association submitted an application to the police commissioner demanding FIR against the school management including principal of the school in connection to death of Chauhan, the standard six student, who was crushed by a state transport bus. 
 
 The application states that although the Harni police has lodged an FIR against the bus driver, due to “some strange reasons”, it has not filed any FIR against the school management or any of its officials responsible for this. 
 
 The application states that the school management was fully aware that the location where students were told to assemble is an accident prone zone and yet students as young as 12-13 years were told to travel by cycle from home and reach the venue risking their lives. 
 
 It further states that police permission was not taken for the assembly of students at VIP Road and similarly even the mandatory permission from the office of the district education officer (DEO) was not sought by the school authorities. 
 
 “There was not a single person/ volunteer deployed by the school to regulate the traffic in front of the school or to safeguard the students from any mishap,” the application stated, adding that while traffic signals were not displayed, adequate speed breakers were also not in place near the accident spot. 
 
 “Some of the onlookers informed me that some school personnel removed the school badge from the body of my deceased son and also that they tried to remove the T-shirt that he was wearing to ward off any culpability from the schools side. This is a grave insult to the deceased soul which is barbaric in nature and also an attempt to tamper with the evidence,” the application submitted by Het’s father   stated.
