Ahmedabad: Even as the state government tries to rein in private schools in the matter of fees, Gujarat high court has said that the new area of crime is the field of education and society is witnessing a surge in this type of crime. 

 Justice N V Anjaria further said that commercialization of education coupled with criminalization will prove disastrous for society. He termed the unchecked commercialization of education a third type of crime, the first two being commercial crime and economic crime. Recently, the state authorities busted a racket of private schools charging high fees and teaching the CBSE syllabus without having any affiliation with the central board.
 
 The court commented so in connection with the charging of very high fees from students on false promises of the schools securing affiliation with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). It rejected the anticipatory bail application filed by the trustee of the HB Kapadia School, Muktak Kapadia, who charged up to Rs 50,000 as fees for the pre-primary section by claiming that his school has CBSE affiliation. He is accused of having “dishonest intention” and cheating over 400 people.
 
 Regarding the accusations of cheating, the HC said, “If they turn out to be true, they are reflective of the third alarming category besides commercial crimes and the economic crimes, a surge of which has been witnessed by society. This third category is the field of education and the allegations in the FIR represent it. Commercialization of education when contaminated with criminalization, the results are bound to be disastrous.”
 
 The high court termed the episode as “peculiarly serious” as it is connected with the field of education. The court has taken it very seriously that the school did not even provide receipts for the fees collected. “The nature and seriousness of the allegations are such which society as a whole would prefer to banish for all time to come,” the court order reads.
