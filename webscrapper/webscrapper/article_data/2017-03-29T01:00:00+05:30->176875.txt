KV Anand’s   has   as one of the leads. But it was not a cakewalk for   and his team to get TR on board. Apparently TR had agreed to work on the film only after a couple of meetings with the director, who got him on board with sheer perseverance. But why? T Rajhendherr explains, “In those days, when I was continuously doing films, I used to get a lot of offers from other directors. I politely turned down those films because I had a policy that I would work only for my scripts. I used to write, shoot, direct, compose music and write lyrics for my films. I was not comfortable with acting in another director’s script. Also, I do not compromise on my policies for the sake of the script. Kavan is the first film that I have acted in a full-fledged role for another director. Even to this film, I had politely said ‘no’ several times. But Anand told me that I must listen to his script and then take a call. He was particular that only I should do that role. I agreed to work on this film because I liked his approach.”

 The actor-director plays Mayilvaganan, an extremely outspoken and bold guy in the film. “Anand told me that I would be apt for the role because I am like that in real life. Before accepting the offer, I thought twice. But after taking up the project, I co-operated and gave what the director wanted,” says TR, who adds that he had to update himself for the shoot of this film. 
 TR says that working with   was a delightful experience. “Vijay Sethupathi had once met me in a studio and had asked for an autograph. He told me that he was my fan. I appreciate his confidence in accepting this film, even though it has another role that is as powerful as the hero’s.”
 
 He signs off saying that even though Kavan, which hits screens on March 31, has a social message, Anand has made it as an entertaining commercial film, and feels that this will be its main highlight.
