Finally, a cinematic end to the catch 22 situation in the Malayalam film industry! 

 We were the first to report the formation of a new association in Malayalam cinema, and now, the association has taken off officially. A large group of major producers, distributors and exhibitors will be part of the new association, which will be headed by actor  , who will be the Chairman. Mohanlal's endorsement of the association is indicated by the appointment of Antony Perumbavoor as the Vice Chairman. The core committee will consist of major producers and distributors which will be decided in the coming days, together with the name of the organisation.
 
  'The intention is not to defeat anyone or to fight with anyone, we have no enmity towards any organisation. Instead, we want to ensure a strike-free atmosphere in Malayalam cinema. In the event of any issues in the future, the core committee will take steps to find a resolution together rather than shut theatres down for trivial issues. There will be no more strikes here. We are all joined by a common dream, and that is the smooth functioning of Malayalam cinema,' said Dileep.
