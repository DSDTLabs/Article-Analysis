MADURAI: Lawyers point out that the allotment of judges to the high court bench has come down compared to last year. The bench has at present only 12 judges out of the total 54 in the Madras high court. “In Chennai there are separate judges to look after admission of cases, appeals and revision. However, the strength is inadequate here. Besides, judges who are well versed in civil cases are posted to handle criminal cases. It results in adjournment of many cases for years. If the court orders notice or counter in a case, its status will become worse as it takes years to settle,” said APP C Mayil Vahana Rajendran.

 “Due to lack of judges, old cases, particularly second appeal cases, have been pending for 10 years. The petitions seeking to condone delay in filing them are also pending for years. In one case, the plea to condone delay of just 10 days was pending for 5 years,” said former   member S Muthukrishnan. 
 
 The bench needs more judges, said   president and senior counsel  . “It needs to be given proper representation in selection of judges. At least one-third of the required judges needs to be allotted here. Besides, in the last 13 years, seven advocates practising at the bench have become judges,” she said. 
 
 A separate bench should be set up to deal with criminal matters, said   president K Samidurai. “The writ cases, habeas corpus petitions, writ appeals in some cases and criminal appeals happened to be heard by the same division bench. If there is a separate bench to deal with criminal matters, it will be helpful to ensure quick disposal of cases,” he said. The bench also needs to look into delay in giving order copy, said former additional government pleader S C Herold Singh.
