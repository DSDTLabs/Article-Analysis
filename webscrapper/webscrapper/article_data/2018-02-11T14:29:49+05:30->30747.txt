If there’s a will, there’s a way.  , who recently lost 10 kilos and is looking 10 years younger, has got to the task of motivating his friends and followers on social media. The actor-musician-politico posted a picture of his at an awards ceremony and wrote: “No Salt, No Gluten, No ‘Kaancha   Bhaat with Ghee (My Fav) etc etc with the min. of minimum cheating since 6th May 2017, has helped me reach my Goal of 10kilo weight loss• And it’s 90% Diet or lifestyle change — I rarely have time for proper exercise • No Fad/crash diet or slimming pills,   or   (the gym guys wud knw ??) either • Another 4kg will be very hard but ‘appreciation’ frm u guys will help (Fishing for compliment with humility is no crime ??) I can’t work hard if health betrays so .. Moral of the Story (if any) : Don’t weaken your mind by repeatedly saying ‘I can’t live without Bhaat/Rice’ • Body & Mind starts believing it & then you actually never can ??” Babul, who is a complete foodie, admitted that he had not had bhaat-ghee-boiled eggs for the past months, but has resolved to have it the day he loses four more kilos. He added, “On a serious note, obesity & the resulting problems are a menace to the society - If this inspires even 2 people, I will be elated.”
