MUMBAI: After a day of thick cloud cover,   saw the skies clear up on Friday.   officials, however, said it continued to be cloudy in northern parts of the state, including Thane and Raigad.

 The IMD’s   and   observatories recorded ‘trace’ (which cannot be recorded) rainfall in the 24 hours between March 15 and 16. 
 
 “But even as Mumbai was clear, there were thunderstorm warnings for   and Marathwada,” said K S Hosalikar,   deputy director-general (western region).
 
 With the clouds gone, temperatures in the city sprung up again. On Friday, the maximum temperatures recorded by the IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatories were almost 6-7 above what was recorded a day ago. The weather bureau said skies are expected to be partly cloudy on Saturday. 
 
 The air quality index too shot up to 203 to enter the poor category on Friday. It had been in the moderate category (between 101 and 200) over the past couple of days. But as winds picked up during the day, the AQI improved to 200. tnn
