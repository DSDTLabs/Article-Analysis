KOCHI:  , a statewide   campaign to protect children from  , saw participation of over 500 schoolchildren at the first workshop held in the district on Monday.

 The one-day awareness campaign was jointly inaugurated by  , international arm-wrestling champion   and director-cum-film artist Arun Viswam.
 
 
 The campaign saw sessions by cyber security officials, including Dhanya Menon, India’s first female cybercrime investigator.
 
 Menon, who led the afternoon session of the campaign, focused more on making children think about their actions than creating awareness.
 
 “In the 15 years of practicing as a cybercrime investigator, I haven’t seen any decline in the number of cases in which children are falling prey to cyber abuse, despite massive awareness campaigns being held across the state. The only option we have is to make children think twice, thrice or a hundred times before they proceed with any online activity. There is no foolproof way to prevent them from being vulnerable to the underside of the cyber world, nor it is possible to separate kids from the cyberspace anymore,” Menon said.
 
 During the session, Menon said: “Though the internet rules stipulate 13 as the minimum age for opening a social media account, as per our laws, a child is considered an adult only at the age of
 
 18. So, passwords of children’s social media accounts are solely the guardians’ responsibility till they are 18.”
 
 The first session, which was guided by Aluva Cyber Cell officials, comprised narrations about real-life cases related to online abuses registered in various police stations in and around the district.
 
 “There is so much more to cyber security than what is being discussed, not just for kids, but for adults as well. The kind of apps which have become a part of our daily lives have a lot to do with privacy invasion,” said Thalhath P M, Aluva cyber cell official.
