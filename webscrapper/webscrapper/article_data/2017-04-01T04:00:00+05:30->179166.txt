Surat: Two moneylenders were booked on the charges of abetting suicide of a man, who had borrowed Rs 30,000 from them but owed around Rs 2 lakh because of high interest levied on the principal amount.

 Vipul Vastarpura, a native of Babra taluka of Amreli district, who lived in Surat, had borrowed Rs 30,000 from Jitu Rabari and Ghabo Bharwad. The duo made papers of Rs 2 lakh and forcibly at knife point made him sign them. 
 
 The duo took Vipul and his cousin Bhupat Vastarpura on March 24 to some place and threatened that if their money was not repaid by March 28, they would kill the former and his father who lived in Amreli. A scared Vipul consumed sleeping pills and committed suicide here on March 28. 
 
 A case was registered at Varachha police station under IPC sections 306, 387,504, 506(2) and 114 and Gujarat Money-Lenders Act sections 32,33 and 34.
 
 “The accused are on the run. We have started a search for them. They might have fled to Saurashtra,” a police officer said.
