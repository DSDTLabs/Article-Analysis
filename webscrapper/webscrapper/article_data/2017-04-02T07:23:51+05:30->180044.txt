PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Employees of the sick public sector pharmaceutical company   ( ) in Pimpri finally have some good news.

 Maval MP Shrirang Barne said the Union government deposited Rs 100 crore in the company’s account on Wednesday towards the payment of salaries, arrears and other critical expenses. “The employees have not received their salaries for the past 22 months. They will get their salaries in due course,” Barne said.
 
 General secretary of   (HAMS) Sunil Pataskar also confirmed the development.
 
 In December, the Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had approved the revival of the company by selling 87.7 acres of prime vacant land, besides the immediate sanction of Rs 100 crore for salaries and arrears.
 
 Barne, who is also the president of HAMS, said he has been pursuing the revival of the company for the last three years and had raised the issue in the parliament twice, besides meeting Union minister for chemicals and fertilizers Ananth Kumar. The HAL management did not comment on the issue.
 
 The cabinet note said the land sale will meet the company’s net liabilities of Rs 821.17 crore, help in waiver of government loans and interest amounting to Rs 307.23 crore, and deferment of various dues amounting to Rs 128.68 crore. “If the liabilities are met and the balance sheet is cleaned, the implementation of the recommendations of the ministers’ committee will be facilitated,” the note said. 
 
 In September 2014, HAMS had sought the intervention of the Prime Minister to revive the company, which was the first drug manufacturing unit of the country.
 
 Over the past six decades, HAL was into the commercial production of several antibiotics like penicillin and life-saving drugs, primarily with the objective of providing them at affordable rates.
