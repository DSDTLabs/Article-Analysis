KANNUR: The indefinite strike called by a section of doctors against suspending a doctor at   (FHC) in Palakkad is illegal and the government will take stringent action against them in case of unauthorized absence, said health minister   The doctor was suspended on Thursday for not appearing for outpatient duty in the afternoon though they were supposed to take shift duties to ensure OP department is functioning between 9am to 1pm and 2pm to 6pm.

 The minister said the doctors at Kumaramputhur were willing to handle the OP in the afternoon on a shift basis, but they were unable to do so because their organization,   medical officersâ€™ association (KGMOA) had asked them not to do afternoon duty. Some doctors fear that it would affect their private practice in the evening and hence they campaign against the family   introduced by the government under the Ardram Mission, said the minister.
 
 The KGMOA called for the agitation against the suspension of a doctor and also saying that the decision to extend the   was an additional burden on them.
