MYSURU: The owners of driving schools and travel agencies staged a protest in the city on Wednesday against the steep hike effected by the   in driving licence fee and other services offered by the regional transport offices (RTOs).

 District Motor Vehicle Driving Schools Ownerâ€™s Association president Anand Kumar said that the decision of the Union transport ministry to hike driving licence fee has left motorists in a quandary. In Mysuru alone, there are 69 driving schools and all of them are facing problem due to the hike.
 
 While the learners licence fee has been increased by seven times from existing Rs 30 to Rs 200, the driving licence fee is hiked to Rs 700 from Rs 250, Anand said.
 
 Protesters later submitted a memorandum to the regional traffic commissioner and said they would write a letter to the governor seeking a rollback of the hike. MLA MK Somashekar also participated in the protest. 
 
 RTO (west) Assistant Regional Transport Officer   told TOI that the software in the Mysuru RTOs have been updated with the latest fee structure. Though the fee hike was announced on January 6, starting Thursday the new fee structure will come into force. Two-wheeler driving licence fee Rs 250 earlier and the revised fee is Rs 700. Learners licence fee will be Rs 200 as against earlier Rs 30. We will display the list of fee structure on the noticeboard, he said.
