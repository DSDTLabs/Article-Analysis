TIRUPUR: In the light of a fatal accident of a 20-year-old woman worker in a private knitting company, trade unions have urged the government to ensure that the labourers who work in the knitwear industry get at least minimal life insurance cover right from day one.

 It was only 15 days since A   of Srirangam in   came to   and joined in a private fabric knitting company, she met with an accident while operating a knitting machine and died on last Wednesday.
 
 “We learnt that the private unit which had employed 12 workers including Bhuvaneswari was not registered and it did not implement either employee’s state insurance ( ) or employment provident fund (EPF). More than 10% of the small and micro unit in the industry would not have registered and it would be difficult to ensure that they follow all safety precautions,” said an official from Inspectorate of Factories.
 
 Police sources said though the death of Bhuvaneswari, a school dropout, was a big loss for her downtrodden family, her family members refused to accept a small compensation which the private knitting unit was ready to pay. “Her family refused to accept the compensation saying that they don’t want the money,” said a police officer.
 
 But it would not be the case with other labourers as their families would need some money if they lose their loved ones. “We heard that Tirupur Exporters’ Association (TEA) has introduced a minimal life insurance cover with the help of New Indian Assurance, which its member companies can avail for their employees. The employees will get around Rs 1 lakh insurance cover with the annual premium under Rs 400,” said  , general secretary,   district.
 
 But even in many well-established companies in Tirupur, the workers will not be able to get employment benefits including ESI immediately once they joined. The workers should get insurance cover right from day one, he urged.
