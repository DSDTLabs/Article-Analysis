When I decided to contest this election, I didn’t even get 10 days to campaign, but I am indebted to the people of Navelim who embraced me with open arms. Navelim has gone backward in terms of development; I will now rededicate myself for the development of my constituency. 
 
 
 
 
 There were several Doubting Thomases who were predicting that the Congress would not get more than 2-3 seats. The results have proven that it is ultimately the people who are the masters. We have our party manifesto and vision document in place; we will try to implement it in the state, no matter which party forms the government. The state has gone backwards during BJP’s rule, and it is a great responsibility to bring Goa back (on the track of development). 
 
 
 
 
 When I came to Goa at the request of Sonia Gandhi, I served the party at the state-level without harbouring any personal expectations. I leave it to the high command to take a decision. I have never shrugged away from taking responsibility, and as the party president, I would accept any responsibility.
