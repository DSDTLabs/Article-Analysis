BHOPAL: The   (DEO) on Thursday issued a notification to all   in Bhopal, asking them not to allow students of class 10 and 12 with less than 75 per cent attendance to sit in  .

 Following the orders of   of Secondary Education (MPBSE), the DEO shot off a letter to high schools and higher secondary schools in the city, stating that 75% attendance is compulsory to appear in board exams of class 10 and 12. The regular students, who failed to have 75% attendance in their academic session ending February 13, will only be allowed in the private student category,” reads the order, a copy of which is with TOI. The DEO has asked the schools to submit forms of such students at the nearest centres. “Such students have to fill a form and apply for private exams otherwise they would lose both the chances to write board exams,” said DEO Dharmendra Kumar Sharma. A circular, dated February 16, states, “No student from a school affiliated to the MP Board shall be eligible to take the examination unless he/she has 75 per cent attendance from the opening of the session to its closing on February 13.
 
 Sham Reniwal, principal, Model School, TT Nagar, said the students should understand the importance of attending classes regularly. “We do face attendance issues, particularly in Class 12, since the students get involved in coaching classes. However, we are strict with the 75 per cent attendance rule. The orders are in the right spirit,” he said. The notice further states that a shortfall of only up to 10 per cent of attendance may be considered as medical leave. “In case of students who have been sick for long and couldn’t attend classes, only 10 per cent attendance is considered as sick leave. For example, if a student has 65 per cent attendance, he/she may present genuine medical certificate and an extra 10 per cent would be awarded by the school after verifying medical documents,” he added.
