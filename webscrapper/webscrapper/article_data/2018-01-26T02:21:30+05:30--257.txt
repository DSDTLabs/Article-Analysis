NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Thursday rejected a plea by a Rajasthan-based group seeking to set aside certification granted to   by the censor board. HC said it is the   which had permitted the release of the film. 

 The   opposing the U/A certification granted to the film was filed before a bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar by Jauhar Smriti Sansthan, a group based in Chittorgarh in Rajasthan.
 
 The bench, however, declined to hear the matter and asked the group to move the apex court as it had permitted the screening of the film, which hit the theatres on Thursday.
 
 The organisation’s general secretary, Bhanwar Singh Bhati, who filed the plea before the bench owing to a lawyers’ strike in the high court, later told the media he will approach the apex court. tnn
