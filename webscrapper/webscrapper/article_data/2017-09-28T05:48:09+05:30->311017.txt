TRICHY: With the   left polluted after 12-day long Pushkaram festival, the civic body organised a massive cleanliness drive on Wednesday with the help of student volunteers and conservancy workers.

 More than 500 college students along with corporation workers participated the cleanliness drive recovering tons of clothes that were abandoned by devotees after taking holy dip during the festival. 
 
 As many as 10 tons of waste was removed from river bed, predominantly comprising of used clothes. The other wastes included garlands and plastics bags. 
 
 The   Pushkaram concluded on 23 September attracting devotees from across and outside the country. 
 
 Cauvery was dry in the beginning of the festival but gained momentum within few days after release of water from Mettur dam. 
 
 Since there was huge crowd during the concluding days of the festival, clothes did not wash away in the flow and got deposited at various points on the river bed. 
 
 It also witnessed extensive littering of plastics and other wastes like garlands despite arrangements made by the civic body to collect these at one place.
 
 Devotees believe that they can get rid of their sins if they abandon their cloths in Cauvery. While such practices are prevalent in north, copious flow of Ganges do not allow waste to stagnate unlike in Cauvery. 
 
 “It’s very difficult to challenge their belief and educate people on the implication of their act on Cauvery,” said city engineer S Amudhavalli. 
 
 “We had kept several bins near the   and insisted devotees on putting their clothes in it but few people followed,” she said. 
 
 “However, we could remove majority waste deposited in the river bed with the help of student volunteers from   and Indira Gandhi college in the city who took active participation in the drive,” she added. 
 
 Around 100 workers from Hindu Religious, Charitable Endowment department and civc body were deployed in the work.
