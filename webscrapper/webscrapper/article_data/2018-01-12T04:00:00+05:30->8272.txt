Rajkot:  , whose cub was run over by a train near Savarkundla two days ago, is keeping villagers and railways on tenterhooks.

 Disturbed by the death of her two-month-old cub, the lioness is refusing to budge from the spot in Amrutvel village, 10km from Savarkundla town. It was on January 9 that the cub was hit by a passenger train when it was trying to cross the tracks near the unmanned railway crossing. 
 
 Sources said the lioness, which was camping in the field nearby, is now often seen sitting on the railway track. Engine drivers have been forced to halt the train mid-way to avoid collision with the lioness. It is also learnt that the lioness chased a few vehicles. 
 
 According to locals, the lioness rushes close to the tracks whenever a train passes by. This route connects Pipavav Port and around 25 to 27 goods trains pass through this route. She came on the tracks on Wednesday night when Mumbai-Mahuva weekly train was passing near Savarkundla, forcing the driver to halt. The train could proceed only after foresters and trackers shooed her away from the tracks
 
 According to sources, a contractual worker of the railways who takes care of the crossing, has left the place out of fear. The lioness is also chasing vehicles, creating a scare among locals. Pratap Chandra, range forest officer of Savarkundla, said, “We have set up three teams which are camping in a tent near the area. We are constantly monitoring the lioness’ behavior. But she won’t attack any human.” 
 
 Wildlife expert Priyavrat Gadhvi said, “Having lost her cub, she is obviously in psychological trauma. This incident raises a larger issue - can we change the schedule of night trains?”
