AHMEDABAD: A 27-year-old teacher Mayur Parekh, a resident of Om Afford Residency in  , killed himself by jumping in front of a goods train near   on Saturday afternoon.

 Police sources said Parekh, the father of a one-year-old girl, was a teacher at United English School. In a note, he attributed his suicide to the entanglements stemming from in an extra-marital affair with a woman colleague called Jayshree.
 
 “The note, ostensibly written by Parekh, says Jayshree’s brother Jignesh and her husband were threatening him to leave the job or face the consequences, including a police case, which would ruin his married life,” said senior police of Ramol police station.
 
 Inspector K S Dave of Ramol police station said, “We have registered an offence of abetment to suicide against Jayshree, her husband and her brother, who had allegedly threatened Parekh”.
 
 According to police sources, Parekh left his home in the morning for Maninagar Railway Crossing and jumped in front of a goods train. “He died on the spot. Locals found an identity card in his pocket and called his family,” added a police official.
 
 When Parekh’s father Ishwar rushed to the spot, other members of his family found a three-page suicide note in his room. “Parekh has accused Jayshree of luring him into an affair and turning the tables on him when her husband found out,” added a police official.
 
 Dave said they hadn’t yet recorded the statements of Parekh’s father, wife and other family members, but it seems they were unaware of the alleged affair.
 
 Meanwhile, Jayshree and her family abandoned their house at   in Ramol. Police officials said they will first have the handwriting on the suicide note verified and then act against the accused.
