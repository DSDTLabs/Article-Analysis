PUNE: Even as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday predicted the monsoon’s arrival in Kerala within the next 24 hours — and in Pune by June 7 —   Weather Services, a private weather forecaster, said the southwest   had already made landfall over the southern state.

 
 Mahesh Palawat, the chief meteorologist at Skymet, said, “All the criteria required for declaring the onset of monsoon over the Indian mainland have been met. The three main criteria — rainfall, wind field and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) — have already been fulfilled.” He reasoned that if after May 10, about 60% of the 14 stations — Minicoy, Amini Devi, Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur, Punalur, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Thalassery, Kannur, Kudulu and Mangalore — report rainfall of 2.5 mm or more for two consecutive days, the onset of monsoon over Kerala can be declared provided the other criteria are also met. Palawat said over 90% of the stations reported rainfall of 2.5 mm or more over the last 48 hours, thereby declaring the onset of monsoon in Kerala on May 28.
 
 The Met department, however, maintained that on Monday, the monsoon had advanced into more parts of southeast Arabian Sea, the Maldives-Comorin area and southwest Bay of Bengal, most parts of  , remaining parts of Andaman Sea, the Andaman and Nicobar islands, many parts of east-central Bay of   and some parts of west-central and northeast   and was yet to make a landfall. Over the next 24 hours, it is expected to cover some more parts of south Arabian sea, remaining parts of Maldives-Comorin, parts of Lakshadweep, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
 
 AK Srivastava, the head of climate monitoring and analysis group at the IMD, said the monsoon is likely to reach Kerala with a bang. “Two weather systems — a well-marked low-pressure area over southeast Arabian sea off Kerala-Karnataka coasts and another low-pressure area over east-central Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood — have been causing good rainfall, indicative of good conditions for the monsoon’s onset,” he said.
