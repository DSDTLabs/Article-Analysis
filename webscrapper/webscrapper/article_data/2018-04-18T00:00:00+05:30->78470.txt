Sassy women from across the city came together to attend the launch of a luxury fashion destination. Dressed to kill, we spotted the ladies checking out the latest in the fashion circuit, and also admiring what the brand had on offer. Black seemed to be the order of the day, and we liked how Aishvarya, Nidhi, Shiny and Roop gave their ensembles in black, a funky twist. 

 Rupa’s tassle pumps and Esha’s tradition-meets-modern earring were admired by many. While Harini’s white dress was striking, Divya’s silky, assymetrical number won her many appreciative glances. The guests were seen exchanging style notes and there was a sense of bonhomie in the air.
