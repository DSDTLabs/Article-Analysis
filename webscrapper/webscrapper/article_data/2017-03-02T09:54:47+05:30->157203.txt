PATNA: There are many twists and turns in the  . While CID (weaker sections) probing the case says no substantial evidence has so far been found against former state   Brajesh Pandey, the special public prosecutor in the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court claims enough evidence against him on the basis of the case diary. Pandey is a non-FIR accused in the case in which automobile showroom owner Nikhil Priyadarshi, his father and retired IAS official  , brother Manish Priyadarshi and friend Sanjeet Kumar Sharma are accused of sexually exploiting the minor Dalit girl, who is the daughter of a state Congress leader. 

 The girl had lodged an FIR with the   in Patna on December 22 against Nikhil and others. 
 
 “The case is complicated as there is no consistency in the victim’s statements and she adds new information every day,” ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar told TOI on Wednesday. “Till now, we have proper evidence only against Nikhil against whom arrest warrant has already been issued,” he said.
 
 Special public prosecutor in the POCSO court, Suresh Chandra Prasad, however, said, “The girl was a minor when she was exploited in January last year. The police, instead of harassing her by questioning time and again, should go behind Pandey and other accused against whom there are enough evidence showing their involvement in the case.”
 
 Prasad said, “The special POCSO court of judge Parwez Alam will hear the anticipatory bail petition of Nikhil on Thursday and for Brajesh on Friday.” He said the police should have also prayed for arrest warrant against the three other named accused. The same court had on February 7 rejected the anticipatory bail petition of the remaining three accused, including Nikhil’s father.
 
 He also revealed that the IO in the case, Kusum Kumari, had already filed a petition seeking transfer of the case from SC/ST court to POCSO court on the basis of an Andhra Pradesh high court judgement of 2015.
