  of a heart attack and added there is nothing suspicious about the way the 

 
   superstar passed away 
 
 , official sources in Dubai said.
 
 
 
 According to an independent journalist working in the Gulf, if a person there dies in hospital, the cause of death is known and the procedure to release the body is quick. However, if a death occurs outside a hospital, even a natural death, police have to be informed and they will investigate the death after they first register a case. In case a body has to be sent overseas for cremation, there are, naturally, even more official steps to be taken, said the journalist Vasudeva Rao.
 
 As per procedure, the body is first kept in the morgue at Al Qusais. After forensic examination at the General Department of Forensic Evidence, the body is handed over to the police. After the autopsy report, a death certificate is given and after that the police give their clearance. 
 
 
 
 Then, the police visa of the person who has passed away is verified, after which the Indian consulate in Dubai cancels their passport, issues a death certificate as well as a no-objection certificate to facilitate transporting of the mortal remains to India.
 
 Amid these arrangements, the police will issue several letters - for the body to be collected from the hospital/morgue, for embalming, to the place where the last rites will be performed, to the airport and to the airlines. The death certificate will be issued in Arabic. The translated copy in English will be provided to the Indian consulate in Dubai after which it will issue a no-objection certificate to the family/relative to transport the body back to India.
