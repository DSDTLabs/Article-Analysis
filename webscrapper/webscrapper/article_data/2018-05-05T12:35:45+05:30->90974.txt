TRICHY: A 17-year-old girl who was apparently forced into child marriage three years ago was rescued on Thursday night at Mannachanallur in Trichy following a complaint that her husband has been torturing her for the delay in conceiving a child. The girl was given shelter at a private children’s home here on Friday. 

 It was an ‘anonymous’ call to   helpline 1098 that brought the issue to light with the caller informing that the girl required the help of officials to escape from her husband in Mannachanallur. A team led by Childline nodal agency’s coordinator, S Thiyagarajan, went to the house and found that the information was true. The girl told the officials that she had been undergoing mental agony for not conceiving as her husband has been abusing her over the issue. She said she wanted to escape from the place. The team rescued her from the house and handed her over to members of child welfare committee ( ) in Trichy who put her up at a government reception home. 
 
 CWC carried out inquiries with the girl on Friday afternoon when she revealed that she was a native of Villupuram district. She was married to the 27-year-old man, a travel agent, in Mannachanallur in 2015. However, child welfare activists did not get even a whiff of the incident then and the girl had to endure the ordeal of living with him for three years. “The girl complained of having undergone mental agony due to pressure from her husband to deliver a baby. After inquiry, we have ordered to keep her in a home as per her wish respecting her religious beliefs pending an inquiry report from the probationary officer,” said CWC chairperson S Indiragandhi. 
 
 The district social welfare department, responsible for preventing child marriages, lodged a complaint against the girl’s husband with the police on Friday. A case was yet to be registered but the police referred the matter to the community service register (CSR).
