 : It's an upbeat and aggressive   that, as part of its 'Look East' policy, is challenging the 25-year Left rule in Tripura. Seeking to cash in on heavy anti-incumbency against chief minister  , the BJP took out a roadshow on Sunday, with home minister   in the lead, even as crowds cheered along both sides of the road.

 If the sea of people who turned up at public meetings on Sunday and lined the roadshow route, repeating chants of ' ' ('let's overthrow') and showering the BJP 'rath' with marigold petals, are any indication, the party has managed to position itself as an alternative to the Left government. It remains to be seen how many of these crowds translate into votes, but both Singh and senior BJP leader Ram Madhav sounded confident of the party's electoral prospects.
 
 The BJP over the past three-and-a-half years has expedited road, rail and air connectivity projects in Tripura. A rail connection between Delhi and Agartala, Mata Sundari Express, was started in 2016 to ease long distance travel to and from Tripura. Also, an additional rail link via   is coming up. Three additional highways are being constructed at Rs 4,000 crore to link Tripura with the rest of the country. Add to this a project to upgrade the Agartala airport to an international one.
 
 "The BJP government at the Centre has made possible this added connectivity to Tripura. In contrast, 25 years of Left rule has failed to bring sufficient fruits of development to the state. We have only seen joblessness among the youth, crimes among women, political violence, poverty, poor healthcare and potholed roads," Singh told a rally in Agartala.
 
 "You have been voting Left to power for 25 years. I appeal to you to give one chance to the BJP. The BJP will offer a secure environment to all, including the common man and even Left workers. Tripura government is still paying its employees as per Fourth Pay Commission's award. The BJP will implement the scales prescribed by  ," he added.
