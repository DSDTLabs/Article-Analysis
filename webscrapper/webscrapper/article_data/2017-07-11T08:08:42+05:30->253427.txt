MUMBAI: Reacting to perceptions that captain   was dominating the coach selection process, Board of Control for Cricket in India ( ) secretary Amitabh Chaudhary clarified on Monday that the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) would only make India skipper “understand” the role of the coach in the Indian team.

 Speaking at the Legends Club function here at the Cricket Club of India (CCI) to celebrate the 68th birthday of former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, Chaudhary said: “Sachin (Tendulkar) was (there) through skype and Sourav (Ganguly and VVS (Laxman) were there. And I was actually touched with the devotion and the time that they gave to the subject. Because of the sensitivity of the issue, they -after due consideration -thought that they could postpone the announcement just to make sure that the other stakeholders understand that a coach has a certain...every individual has a certain style.
 
 “Every professional can have a certain style. So the other stakeholders are made to understand that the style is typical of person and therefore we should become accommodative if that. So it was only with this intent that the three greats decided to announce it (the name of the coach) later.”
 
 Meanwhile, a top board official told TOI, “Kohli will be told that we have interviewed five people and found such and such person. He's the best coach for Indian cricket. This is why we feel he is good. So you have to work with him and we are discussing with you because don't want a repeat of the Kumble situation. This is a two-year appointment. So please don't fight...work with the new coach calmly.”
 
 The source, however, said that only the CAC knows the name of the new coach. “They have made the choice. We don't know what that choice is because only the three of them (of CAC) were involved in that discussion when that choice was made, and no other board official was a part of it.”
