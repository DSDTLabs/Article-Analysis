Abhijit Guha plays an art director in Srijit Mukerji’s   starring Sara Sengupta, Jisshu U Sengupta, Srabanti and Sayantika Banerjee. Being a director himself, how was it to be directed by another director, we asked Abhijit. “I do act at times. When I sign a film as an actor and go to the floors, I forget that I am a director and follow the director’s instructions as he is the captain of the ship. Srijit is a wonderful director to work with,” said Abhijit. He added, “My character is very interesting. He is a part of Anjan Dutt’s team in the film. He is talented but arrogant, drinks a lot but when it comes to work, he is simply the best. So as an actor, I got the opportunity to play with my character. All I can say is that Uma will be one of Srijit's best films. ”
