HYDERABAD: After Qatar deported ‘wanted’ Mohammed Shafeeq  , an accused in the 2002 Dilsukhnagar Sai Baba temple blast, Telangana police have now discovered that the alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) activist had been making a living by selling ‘ittar’ (perfume) in Dubai for the last 16 years.

 "Mujawar has been accused of organising several meetings in Dubai in association with other accused and conspired in executing the bomb blast, in which two persons died, Mujawar was a member of the outlawed Student Islamic Movement of India (SIMI),” credible sources told TOI.
 
 With the arrest of Mujawar, only one accused, Mohammed Bari, the alleged prime suspect in the Sai Baba temple blast case, whom Crime Investigation Department (CID) had declared as accused number 1, is still missing in the case.   is also believed to be taking shelter in Dubai.
 
 So far, in the case, 11 members were declared as accused. Some suspects had died in the interim, while the arrested culprits were facing trial.
 
 Sources said Mujawar's bid to evade police dragnet for long finally ended when he took a flight from Dubai to Doha. After landing at the Doha airport, he was waiting for immigration clearance, when authorities got a red flag on their security system, stating that a Red Corner Notice (RCN) was pending against Mujawar. Qatar authorities on Sunday deported Mujawar, a native of Mumbai, to New Delhi. An RCN is also pending against Bari.
 
 On Tuesday, he was produced before a local court. Immediately, the CID filed a petition seeking Mujawar’s custody, for questioning. However, the court posted it for hearing to Wednesday.
