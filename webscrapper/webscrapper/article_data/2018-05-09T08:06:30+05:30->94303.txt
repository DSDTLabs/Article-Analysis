LUCKNOW:   is unlikely to field its candidates in   and Noorpur byelections. Though an official announcement is yet to be made even as only two days are left to file nomination papers, sources said that the party has decided in principle that it would not field any candidate on the two seats. 

 "It is important to ensure that   doesn't win the two seats. To achieve this target, opposition parties stay must stay together," said a senior functionary. The Kairana parliamentary seat was vacated following the demise of BJP MP Hukum Singh, assembly seat Noorpur was vacated after the death of sitting MLA Lokendra Singh Chauhan in a road accident. Till recently, Imran Masood - the party's strong man in western UP - was being projected as the candidate from Kairana. 
 
 
 
 
 However, on Tuesday Masood, who is also the state vice-president, told TOI that he would toe the party line. Congress sources, meanwhile, maintained that it would not be wise to risk Masood at this point of time against the BJP. “The party is trying to consolidate itself in UP for the 2019 elections. A poor show at this hour would demoralise the party supporters,” said a Congress leader.
 
 UP Congress president Raj Babbar, however, said that official word on the issue was awaited. But he maintained that Congress would do anything to ensure BJP’s defeat. Asked when will Congress announce its candidates for Kairana and Noorpur, he said: “We don't want to do anything that gives the BJP candidate an advantage.” On whether Congress was making sacrifice for the sake of a united opposition, Babbar said, “All I can say about the mega alliance at this point of time is that we were the first one to bring all parties on a common platform.”
 
 Congress on board will surely strengthen the SP supported RLD candidate Tabassum Begum who was a BSP MP.
