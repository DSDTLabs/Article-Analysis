GUWAHATI: After   minister of state for foreign affairs   stated that Bangladesh was never 'officially' informed about the   to  , the   (PVM), an anti-influx forum of the state, accused both the Centre and the state government of misleading the people of the state. 

 Holding the state government party to the alleged 'fraud' by the Centre, PVM's convener and Supreme Court advocate Upamanyu Hazarika said, "It's strange that the state government had not taken up the matter with the Centre for so long and and kept the entire community in dark. The state government therefore is party to the fraud."
 
 The Bangladesh minister had said that India has never discussed the 'reported' influx problem with the former at the diplomatic level. He went ahead saying that Bangladesh would surely discuss the matter if the Centre sends such report. "Since the illegal migrants have always been used as 'vote bank' by all political parties, they have not hesitated to fool Assam's indigenous people for their political gains. These leaders provided lip service only," Hazarika, who had headed a SC commission reporting Indo-Bangla border, alleged.
 
 In 2014, PM Narendra Modi, during election rallies in the state, had promised that all illegal Bangladeshi immigrants would have to pack their bags and leave the state and country after BJP comes to power. To inform Modi about the views of youth and people of the state on the infiltration issue, PVM recently started an online petition to push for 1951 as the cutoff year for detection and deportation of foreigners from Assam.
 
 
  After Bangladesh minister of state for foreign affairs Mohd Shahriar Alam stated that Bangladesh was never 'officially' informed about the illegal migration of Bangladeshi nationals to Assam, the Prabajan Virondhi Manch (PVM), an anti-influx forum of the state, accused both the Centre and the state government of misleading the people of the state.
