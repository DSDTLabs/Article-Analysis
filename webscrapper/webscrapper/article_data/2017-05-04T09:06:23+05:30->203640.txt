RANCHI: The National Assessment and Accreditation Council ( ) recognised   with a B plus plus grade and 2.80 cumulative grade point average (CGPA) out of four after the council released its latest ranking status of universities. 

 Founded in 1960 and headquartered in the state capital, the varsity has a total capacity of one lakh students, 22 post graduate departments and the central library with an exhaustive collection of over 2 lakh books and research journals on its campus.
 
 The   (VBU), Hazaribag, and  , Chaibasa, were ranked by NAAC in 2016, much ahead of the RU. The VBU grading was similar to RU’s but its CGPA was 2.88. 
 
 RU has fared better than Kolhan University which was given C grade by NAAC last year and 1.6 CGPA. 
 
 RU VC R K Pandey sounded positive with the ranking. “We were late but our CGPA is better than KU’s. We could have scored better but the lack of a centralised campus worked to our disadvantage,” he said. 
 
 The VC added, “Unlike other varsities, we have examination data processing cells where degree and post graduate results are prepared and we do not outsource results.” 
 
 Other important facilities which impressed the NAAC team members were teaching assistance programmes under which toppers are retained and given scholarships of Rs 4,500, a multi-purpose examination hall, online security system for mark sheets, UGC-sponsored research projects and infrastructure.
 
 As far as the benefits are concerned, he said, “We will be able to improve our higher education system as funding will no longer be an issue now and within a year we will try to achieve A grade.”
