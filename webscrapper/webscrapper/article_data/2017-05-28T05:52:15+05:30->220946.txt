AHMEDABAD:  , who had timer chips made for bombs which went off in   in Ahmedabad, was a   in Kerala. Crime branch sources said that he had even opened a film production company by selling his wife’s jewellery but could not find success.

  “After he failed as a filmmaker and could not earn during his frequent visits to the Middle East, Pottanikkal turned to his old friends, Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal — the founders of Indian Mujahideen,” said a senior crime branch official. “ He wanted to make money by providing timer chips for bombs meant for different parts of the country.”
 
 At the time, Pottanikkal had already been in touch with alleged terror suspects such as E T Saifuddin. 
 
 “Pottanikkal was the one who had disposed of pipe bombs made by Saifuddin in 1993 in Mallapuram, Kerala,” an investigator said. “In 2008, while Pottanikkal was in Mumbai on the instance of Bhatkal brothers, he called Saifuddin and asked him make timer chips for bombs to be planted by IM in Ahmedabad and Surat.” Incidentally, 29 bombs planted in Surat did not explode. 
 
 Crime branch officials said that the timer chips for the bombs were made at Saifuddin’s electronics shop at Parappanagady in Kerala and then transported by Yasin to Ahmedabad and Surat. Twenty bombs went off in Ahmedabad on July 26, 2008, killing 56 and injuring more than 250. “In Surat, they had placed five to six detonators in each bomb instead of two,” the investigator said. “The 12-volt battery could not ignite such a large number of detonators and the bombs failed to explode.” Riyaz, who was hiding in Pune at the time, had reprimanded Yasin Bhatkal for the blunder as they had wanted to dramatically avenge the killing of Muslims in the  .
