 It’s directed by  , an ad filmmaker, who’s worked at some of India’s biggest advertising agencies over the past 20 years. Excited about his debut in the realm of feature films, he says, “I had made 30-second advertisements for far too long, and I wished to do something more than just listen to agencies and clients. I’m usually the one to start narrating a story at a party and after every story I told my friends, they would always ask me to make a film.” 
 The big push came along from his daughter, though. He reveals, “My nine-year-old daughter asked me if I was going to direct a film. When I said yes, she replied back with something that surprised me. She said, ‘Papa, I’ll never be able to watch the film you make because I don’t think it will be age appropriate.’ That’s when it struck me that I should be making a film that can be watched by everyone between the age of eight and 80.” 
 
 Sudip wrote the central character of his film with Naseeruddin Shah in mind. In fact, the film and its characters are drawn from his own life experiences. He says, “I was studying in Kolkata when I first met an old uncle who used to operate a box camera machine that used to enlarge copies in a most intensive and unusual mechanical process. This old uncle and his little stories inspired Naseer saab’s character in the film. People will like the sweetness and simplicity of my film.”
