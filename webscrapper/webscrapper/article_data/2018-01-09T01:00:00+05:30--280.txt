It was all about burning rubber, revving engines and flying dust at the AutoXXX 18-1 autocross event held at   on   this Saturday. The event was organized by AutoXXX under the aegis of Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, Indiaâ€™s governing body for motorsport, and saw the participation of several dozen drivers and cars from Gurgaon, Delhi and even cities in Punjab and Rajasthan. The participating vehicles ranged from small hatchbacks and stock cars to modified 4x4 beasts. The competitors raced across various categories divided on the basis of car make and engine power.

  The newly-laid track did pose a challenge for even the most experienced of drivers with many finding the sharp turns and jump stretch a bit hard to handle. The drivers said it was a technical track where one needed to be cautious. 
 
  
  
 
  "Because there were over a hundred runs here, a number of ruts were formed which made it a bit slower and more demanding. But it's a good track," said Aman, a veteran driver. However, that did not deter most from going flat out in their runs. The challenging track did pose some problems for a few drivers and a handful of cars were stuck on the track too, but the participants chalked such incidents down to driver errors rather than any shortcomings on the track.

  With a number of novices and first-timers rubbing shoulders with racing veterans, drivers said that the competition acted as a good platform for the beginners to learn and move ahead. 
 
  
  
 
  Sanjay Razdan, a rally driver from the city, said, "Events like these are great for Gurgaon and the rest of NCR. They act as stepping stones for bigger and more challenging races and events. We have a category for novices here, so that they can compete with professionals and hone their skills."
