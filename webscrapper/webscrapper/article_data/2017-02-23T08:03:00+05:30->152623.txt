Gurgaon: The probe into   has revealed that Profit Network, the Gurgaon-based company that allegedly offered its investors   for “liking online pages”, planned to shift its base to Maharashtra’s Mahabaleshwar. All four accused were taken to Mahabaleshwar by a police team from Gurgaon on Wednesday as part of the investigation.

 Police on Wednesday visited three more banks and found that the accounts of the company had funds to the tune of around Rs 1 lakh. Efforts, according to police, are under way to freeze these bank accounts.
 
 “We found three more bank accounts in the name of Profit network. While the company has Rs 5,000 in   bank’s Golf Course branch, it has Rs 50,000 in Kotak Mahindra bank in Sector 10A and Rs 7,000 in Bandhan bank,” said a police officer who is privy to the investigation. As many as 13 bank accounts of the company have been frozen by the investigators so far, according to sources.
 
 Four people, including the directors and manager of Profit Network, were arrested on Sunday for their alleged role in the scam. Police said the accused duped 4,866   of Rs 8 crore and planning to go abroad.
 
 The accused have been identified as Medicom directors Jaipur-based Daulat Singh Shekhawat (32) and Alwar resident Bharat Kumar (27). Their manager Rajkumar Sharma and partner Ajay were also arrested.
 
 The accused, who are on a six-day police remand, reportedly confessed that they duped around 5,000 people on the pretext of promising quick and lucrative returns to investors for clicking ‘likes’ on designated links on social media. The police probe revealed that the company sent fake links to investors.
 
 “The accused were trying to shift their business operation to Mahabaleshwar. They had visited the hill town to look for an office space. Our team went to Mahabaleshwar with the accused looking for others who are involved in the scam. We are trying to nab the rest,” inspector Anand Yadav, who is investigating the case, told TOI.
