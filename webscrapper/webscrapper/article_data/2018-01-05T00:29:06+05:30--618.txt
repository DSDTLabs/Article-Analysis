Kanyakumari: Padmanabhapuram MLA T Mano Thangaraj (DMK) has been at the tent at Puliyoorkurichi near Thuckalay on the Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram National Highway since Tuesday. He is leading a sathyagraha seeking relief from the government for the cyclone-hit people of the district. “They voted for me and it is my duty to fight for their cause,” said the MLA, who even slept at the protest venue during nights. Repeated attempts made by the district administration and the police to convince him to end the protest went in vain. “I came to know that they were going to arrest me on Wednesday evening, but I am firm in continuing the protest,” he added. The MLA said that the main demand is to declare Ockhi as a national disaster. He said that proper compensation should be given to the farmers who incurred loss due to the cyclone and also provide compensation for the houses that were damaged. He said that there is no party colour or flag attached to the protest as it is a people’s protest. Since the assembly session is to begin on January 8, Mano said that he will be taking a call on continuing the protest after consulting with the party head office. On Thursday an all-party meeting took place at the protest venue to discuss on continuing the protest. Representatives of Congress, CPI, CPI(M), MDMK, DMDK, VCK, Popular Front of India and Social Democratic Party of India took part in the meeting. “If the government tries to forcibly bring the protest to an end, I will continue the protest in front of the secretariat or in front of the chief minister’s house,” he said and added that the protest will continue till their demands are met or till all of them are jailed for fighting for a noble cause.
