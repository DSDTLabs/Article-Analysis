NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of   node can look forward to better infrastructure and civic amenities in the next few months. 

 The civic body has chalked out a large scale development plan for the entire node, which was under Cidco till December 2016. The general body sanctioned around Rs 85 crore last week for all the development work.
 
 The nodes to be developed include sectors 1 to 9 and 21. Road repairs will be carried out in sectors 15 to 22. The development work will also include construction of a sewage treatment plant.
 
 The nature of work the civic administration would be undertaking, includes laying and repairing of roads, installing road furniture, developing footpaths, constructing of rainwater channels, laying of utility ducts, water and sewerage lines. 
 
 The development work will also include changing of streetlights in the node. As many as 46 sodium vapour lights are to be replaced with LEDs.
 
 “The development work will be undertaken in phases. Officials have also visited the node to understand the amenities required. Many other works are scheduled to be done in the future too,” said municipal commissioner N Ramaswami. 
 
 Elected representatives from the node have been criticized on various occasions about the administration’s failure to develop the node. 
 
  “We are grateful that at least now, after nearly eight months of the transfer to PCMC, some development work will finally take place in the node but there is more to be done,” said Shiv Sena corporator Prashant Patil.
 
  The development work will focus on providing basic amenities like developing market spaces, hospitals, and acquiring plots for a crematorium.
