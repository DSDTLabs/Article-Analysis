ATTARI: In a dingy barrack of  's Landhi jail, Indian fisherman   was worried about his daughter's marriage. But when news of his release was broken to him, Jina suffered a heart attack and died a day before he was to be sent back to his country , said Uka, an Indian fisherman who was part of the   repatriated by the Pakistan government late on Friday night via the Attari land border.
 The Indian fishermen were arrested by Pakistan's maritime security agency after they accidentally drifted into Pakistan's territorial waters with a sudden gust of wind while fishing on the high seas. They were lodged in Karachi's Landhi jail.
 
 Uka said the marriage of one of Jina's daughters was scheduled to be held in February . “Sometime after he was told about his release, he complained of chest pain. We rushed him to the dispensary, where he breathed his last,“ he said, adding that his body was sent to the morgue of a local NGO, Edhi Foundation in Karachi.
 
 Dilawar Ibraham, another freed fisherman, spoke about the pitiable condition of Indian fishermen in Pakistan jail. He suggested that the government should not restrict itself to securing the release of fishermen there but also take their boats back from the Pakistan government.
 
 “Fishing in the high seas is a risky business anyway but we face additional danger of being arrested,“ said Mohan, another fisherman.At present, he said, more than 150 fishermen are still lodged in jail.
 
 However, all the fishermen were unanimous in their appreciation for Edhi Foundation for the respectful treatment accorded to them.They said foundation members gave them gifts for their families and made them feel like guests. “Volunteers of Edhi foundation would ask each freed fisherman about specific needs and how the Foundation could help them,“ said Mohan.
