AGARTALA: Alleging that the   government is responsible for underdevelopment and the massive growth of unemployment in the state, Tripura Pradesh   president   announced on Friday that all unemployed youths will be given a monthly allowance of Rs 5000 if the Congress is voted into power in the assembly election. 

 Speaking to the media on Friday, Sinha said the Congress has bright chances in the state because the people have grown wise to how the Left Front is looting the state and the   lacks a political base here. 
 
 Sinha said, "The Left Front will be rejected this time for its massive corruption in misusing development funds and chit fund scams which looted Rs 35,000 crores from 14 lakh people of the state in the past 10 years. Most of the ministers and MLAs from   are supposed to be in jail by now but Manik Sarkar did not allow the CBI to investigate the case. Now I have heard that Modi has taken up an initiative to conduct the CBI enquiry," Sinha said.
 
 Sinha also alleged that the BJP is attempting communal politics here by driving a wedge between tribals and non-tribals. "They are forging an alliance with the Indigenous Peoples' Front of Tripura, which has been seeking a separate state for tribals. Moreover, the BJP is trying to instigate Hindus against Muslims to trigger communal riots."
 
 Sinha additionally promised that government employees will get benefits of the 7th Central pay commission's recommendations if the Congress is allowed to install a stable government. 
 
 "Farm loans will be waived off. All 14 lakh chit fund victims will get back their money after the first cabinet meeting of the new government," said Sinha.
 
 Meanwhile, 7,400 workers from the Congress, the Lok Janasakti Party and the CPM, including former Congress minister Bibha Nath, joined the BJP in North Tripura's Dharmanagar. BJP state president Biplab Kumar Deb also welcomed renowned cardiologist Dr Tamajit Nath and former SP Gopal Sarkar to the party.
