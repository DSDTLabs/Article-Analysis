PANAJI: Following a directive from the High Court of Bombay at Goa, the captain of ports (CoP) has written to the government seeking approval to allot a jetty to Golden Globe Hotels Pvt Ltd. 

 A CoP official told TOI on Thursday that they have forwarded the file to the government, and its response is awaited.
 
 In December last year, Golden Globe Hotels Pvt Ltd had filed an application before the high court seeking approval from the government to allot a jetty for operating feeder boats for the casino vessel, M V   instead of M V Lucky Seven.
 
 Advocate general   had told the court then that necessary orders will be issued to the petitioner.
 
 A jetty was sought to be allotted to M V San Domino instead of M V Lucky Seven as the latter has been sent for repairs. 
 
 Since the repair work of M V Seven would take more time, the petitioner had hired M V San Domino for operating an off-shore casino.
 
 The CoP in an affidavit had also assured the court that the petitioner which had applied for allotment of jetty, would be given one.
 
 The petitioner then had told the court that it intends to start its operations this month after the vesselâ€™s refurbishment is completed.A CoP said Golden Globe Pvt Ltd, have not yet intimated them that refurbishing has been completed.
