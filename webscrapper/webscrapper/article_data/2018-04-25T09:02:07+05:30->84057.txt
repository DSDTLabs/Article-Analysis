CHANDIGARH: To overcome the shortage of   in various government health facilities across the state, the   government is likely to discuss appointing 282 more staff nurses during its next cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on April 30.

 Before this, the state government had in April last year decided to appoint 673 regular staff nurses. Also, as many as 919 multipurpose health workers were also appointed in various hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres and sub-centres.
 
 Another agenda that is expected to be tabled in the next meeting of the council of ministers is regarding the appointment of MLAs as legislative secretaries. As announced by chief minister  , Congress legislators would be accommodated as legislative secretaries to assist the cabinet ministers in the legislative business. Legislative secretaries would be accommodated in the assembly building. As per the proposal, they would not be paid any extra money and allowances, and facilities other than what they are drawing as the MLAs. They would only be given secretarial staff for their smooth functioning in the assembly.
 
 After the resentment among the Congress MLAs left out of the cabinet and those who felt that scheduled castes and backward classes did not get enough representation in the cabinet, the chief minister has promised to suitably accommodate them.
 
 Addressing the media persons on Tuesday, Amarinder said those left out would also be accommodated as chairmen in boards and corporations, apart from other bodies.
