Actor Alicia Vikander said when she first crossed paths with her husband  , they did not speak but ended up dancing together. 

  
  
  The 29-year-old actor said the duo met at events such as the   in 2014 and again after the   Awards shortly afterwards that they did not get a chance to talk. "The first two times we met, we didn't chat, we only danced," Vikander told to media. 
 
  The Swedish actor, who recently moved to Lisbon with 40-year-old Fassbender, said they had discussed living in the Portuguese capital in their first meeting. 
 
  "When I met my husband three and a half years ago, he had mentioned he'd been to Lisbon and loved it, and I knew friends who were moving out there. And that was a time when I was just starting to feel really at home in London, but after Brexit I think I was like, 'Meh, you know what, I want to stay in Europe'," Vikander said.
