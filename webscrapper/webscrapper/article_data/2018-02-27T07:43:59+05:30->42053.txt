SURAT: Finally, passengers, especially senior citizens and disabled, will be able to reach all the platforms easily at Surat railway station with the Western Railway (WR) dedicating the up and down escalator at the old parcel office to the public here on Monday. 

 The work to install the escalator had gained momentum following reports published in TOI in October 2017, highlighting the plight of senior citizens due to the non-functional escalator at the parcel office for the last one-and-a-half-year.
 
 Following the TOI reports, the WR terminated the contract with the earlier firm on charges of defaulting in installing and commissioning of escalator at Surat. A new contractor was hired and awarded the work.
 
 The escalator installed at the old parcel office near platform number 1 will facilitate passengers to reach straight to the platform number 1, 2, 3 and 4. Also, an elevator was started for passengers at the reservation centre to reach platform number 1. 
 
 Railway Station Development Citizen Forum (RSDCF) member   said, “At last, the WR has come to the rescue of passengers in the   as well as outstation passengers. We were continuously pursuing the escalator issue with the WR and   for a long time.”
 
 Additional divisional railway manager (ADRM) Khushal Singh, Navsari MP C R Paatil and Surat MP   were present when the escalator was inaugurated.
