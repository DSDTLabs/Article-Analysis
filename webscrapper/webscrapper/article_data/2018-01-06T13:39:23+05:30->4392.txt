Actress  's father   is "furious" and wants to "kill" the disgraced movie mogul   for sexually harassed his daughter in mid-1990's.

 He has gone as far as to threaten to kill him and is adamant that he be jailed for life.
 
  
  
 The 78-year-old actor told to media, "If I meet him on the street... he oughta hope that he goes to jail, because if we come across I think he'll be lying on the floor, somehow, magically."
 
 Mira Sorvino was one of the many women, who came forward last year and accused Weinstein of sexually harassing her in a hotel room in the mid-Nineties.
 
 She also accused that Weinstein had a hand in derailing her movie career, which faded in the years after winning an Oscar for 'Mighty Aphrodite'.
 
 The Miramax Films producer deliberately blacklisted Sorvino's Oscar-winning daughter Mira after she rejected his sexual advances.
 
 Later, the   star praised her father in a post on Twitter, by labelling him, "the most loving father' and 'best grandpa ever".
