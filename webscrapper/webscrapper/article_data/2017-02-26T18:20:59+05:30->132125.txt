Oscar-winning   Common has rebuked President   proposed plan to combat violence in Chicago, Illinois. 

  
  
 Common, who was born and raised in the city, responded to a warning Trump tweeted regarding its high crime rate. Trump wrote, "If Chicago does not fix the horrific 'carnage' going on - 228 cases of shooting in 2017, with 42 deaths (24 per cent up compared to 2016 - I'm sending the Feds!" 
 
 
 His comments did not sit well with   who wants the President to leave curbing the city's violence to it's residents "We need our stay local people to do things we don't need that type of mentality, so I am not focused on the president right now I'm focused on helping the people in the city," he said. 
 
 The 44-year-old rapper is the founder of Common Ground, a foundation that works to aid the disadvantaged community in Chicago through arts education and mentor-ship.
