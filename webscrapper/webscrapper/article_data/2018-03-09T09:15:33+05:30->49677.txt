BHOPAL: On International Women’s Day, chief minister   announced a pension scheme for single women above and widows above 50 years of age — one perhaps unique in the country.

 “I’ve set up the ‘Mukhyamantri Mahila Kosh’ for women who are above 50 years and unmarried. They will be given pension to ensure that they can take care of themselves,” the CM said at a Mahila Sammelan. He didn’t specify the amount.
 
 He was overwhelmed by emotion while announcing the pension scheme, and said: “It is not possible to run a household, the country or the world without women even for a day. Why do we have only one day as Women’s Day when we know that it’s not possible to survive without them?” Women labourers will be given Rs 4,000 every month from their sixth month of pregnancy till childbirth and Rs 12,000 after delivery, he said.
 
 He urged women to follow their dreams. “The times are changing. Women hold important posts in every walk of life. Let your dreams take wing,” he said.
 
 Boys should be taught to respect women, says Chouhan
 
 Boys should be given lessons on culture so that they learn to respect women, right from childhood, Chouhan said.
 
 Reiterating his tough stand on crimes against women, the chief minister said: “We worship women as Goddesses. Anyone who misbehaves with women will be given the death penalty. A bill on this has been sent to the President for approval.”
 
 The chief minister felicitated 73 women for achievements in their fields and welfare schemes.
