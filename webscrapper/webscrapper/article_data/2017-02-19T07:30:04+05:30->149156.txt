BENAULIM: Union minister for civil aviation Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Saturday said the first flight from the greenfield  , that is being built by  , in North Goa, would take off in May 2020. Chief minister   had earlier said that the first phase of the proposed airport at Mopa would be completed by 2019.

 “We visited Mopa yesterday and we had an interaction with the concessionaire and they feel it will take three to three-and-a-half years. So, it is likely to be operational by May 2020,” said Raju, addressing reporters on the sidelines of an aviation workshop.
 
 Raju visited the   site and spoke to the management of GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GMRGIAL), the subsidiary of GMR that has been tasked with constructing the airport on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis.
 
 “It is a very good deal. The project’s first phase cost, excluding the land cost, is Rs 1,800 crore. It will be commissioned by May 2020. The land cost is about Rs 200 crore,” Union civil aviation secretary Rajiv Nayan Choubey said.
 
 GMR Airports Ltd, which is developing the Rs 4,500 crore project, spread over 2,000 acres, in a public-private-partnership mode. The concession offers 232 acres of land for commercial city-side development for a period of 60 years.
 
 Raju lauded the role played by the state BJP government in pursuing Mopa airport and getting it cleared despite stiff opposition.
 
 “I must complement Goa for taking this whole process forward. There are many other airports where we are struggling to get land but Goa was able to go ahead and finish the deal,” Raju said.
