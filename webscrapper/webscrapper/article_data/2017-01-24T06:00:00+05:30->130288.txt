Visakhapatnam: A number of civic problems haunt the residents of Gavara Kancharapalem under 43 ward of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) but the main one is the presence of a railway gate on a track through which nearly 90 trains pass everyday. This apart, the area suffers from poor drainage system, lack of transportation facilities and improper roads, defunct streetlights and dog and pig menace.  As many as 500 households are located in the area which is close to Gnanapuram Railway Station, Kancharapalem and Visakhapatnam Port. N Sambamurthy, a shop owner close to the Rammurthipanthulupeta railway main gate, said, “We are facing difficulties in getting services like ambulances or fire engines as the railway gate is almost always closed.” P Rama Rao, executive member of Gavara Kancharapalem Grama Abhyudhaya Sangham, said the primary problem of the area was the railway gate. “If any accident happens or a fire mishap occurs in our area, it is very difficult for an ambulance or a fire tender to enter into this locality due to the railway gate. We face problems crossing the gate. We have asked for a foot overbridge and an underpass road, but it did not happen and no one responded to our woes so far,” Rao said. According to railway sources, nearly 90 trains daily pass through the railway gate towards the city railway station. “Due to no foot overbridge, people are forced to cross the railway track. There were several incidents of close escape from the train hits,” P Malleswara Rao added. “We have made several appeals to the local MLA. We are ready to leave the area if the government provides another suitable location for us to live, but that is not happening either,” said K Srinivasa Rao, one of the executive of the association.
