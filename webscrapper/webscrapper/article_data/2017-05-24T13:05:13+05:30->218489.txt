PANAJI: The architectural character of buildings in Goa should be promoted to maintain the state’s identity instead of diluting it with alien features, opined speakers at the recent centenary year celebration of the annual foundation day organised by the   (IIA) – Goa Chapter.

 Speaking at the open forum on the theme “Recapping 100 years — past, present and design for a better future”, minister for town and country planning,  , said that the architecture of a place is a reflection of the political era of the place. “Let ‘Goenkarponn’ lead to the promotion of the architectural character of buildings in Goa,” he said.
 
 Architect Manguesh R Prabhugaonker, chairman – IIA Goa chapter, said architectural features like glass houses are becoming common in the state’s building landscape. “Glass houses are completely alien to our place and architecture,” he said.
 
 Senior architect   said that development is not just about creating infrastructure. Whenever there is an investment in some field, it should have a revenue-generating mechanism by understanding the needs of the local community needs, he said.
 
 Architect   said the town and country planning department should not be just a regulatory body for issuing approvals, but should also set up a cell to consider taking decisions in essential planning matters.
 
 During his introductory speech, noted town planner   stressed on the need for a white paper to be presented to the government on the overall concerns and solutions for adequate strategies of architecture and town planning. “IIA has to play an active role in formulating policies for states in many cases where policy-making, with a deep analysis at the grassroots level to urban areas, has remained pending for years, he said. 
 
 Speakers said architects, who can play a larger role in policy and decision-making of the government, have not been included in the planning of smart cities or urban renewal.
