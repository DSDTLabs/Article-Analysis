LUCKNOW : Chief Justice of   Justice   urged Lucknow University’s graduates to consider a career in law in case they are clueless about the future even after obtaining a degrees. Speaking as chief guest at the university’s   on Saturday, Justice Bhosale said, “There are many students who have a great brilliant academic record but don’t know where to alight after graduation. For all such students who are otherwise determined to do something in their life, there is one door which is always open and that is a career in law.’’ 

 The legal profession holds a great future, he said, adding that with changing times, the practice of law has changed too. “Now, merit is recognised. There are firms in Mumbai and Delhi where hundreds of law graduates are employed. They don’t go to court and practise on a non-litigation site. Legal profession today is vertically divided into litigation and non-litigation, the latter offering tremendous scope,’’ said Justice Bhosale, adding that even for the appointment of a small post of clerk or peon, there are lakhs of applications, making it difficult for recruiting officers.
 
 To make students understand the importance of planning career progression, Justice Bhosale shared the anecdote of an absent-minded professor who was once travelling in a train. On seeing a ticket checker entering the compartment, the professor fished in his pocket for his ticket and even when the ticket checker approached him, he was still searching. In all humility, the ticket checker said he knew the professor as he had been his student and he was sure his teacher would never travel without ticket. The professor replied he was searching for the ticket, actually, to know where was he going. “Never let failure discourage you. There are many avenues for brilliant students and patience is the key to success,’’ said the chief guest.
