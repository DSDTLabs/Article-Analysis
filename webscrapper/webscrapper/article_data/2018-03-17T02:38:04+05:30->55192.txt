NEW DELHI: The man arrested for the murder of a 10-year-old boy has said he killed the boy for resisting sexual  . He slit the boy’s throat and dumped the body into the Agra canal near Jaitpur. 

 The accused, Amar Nath, was arrested last week. Ever since then, he tried to mislead the investigation. Police say he is addicted to drugs and alcohol. 
 
 Nath found the boy playing with Holi colours with his friends outside his school and lured him away by promising to get him more colours. Nath then took him near the canal and tried to sexually assault him. The boy protested, raised an alarm and threatened to tell his parents everything about it. 
 
 Afraid of getting caught, Nath pulled out a knife and slit the boy’s throat. When the boy didn’t return home till late, his father, who is an insurance agent, went to the school to find out. There, he was horrified to learn that the child didn’t come to school that day. The family lodged a police complaint. 
 
 Police found in their initial probe that the boy had climbed over the school wall to meet his friends. DCP (southeast)   said a team was formed to look for the child after this. During investigation, a friend of the boy said a man wearing an earring and having a French beard had taken the boy away. A sketch was prepared. 
 
 Police searched for the man in the locality and found Nath who was part of a group carrying a ‘Sai ki palki’. His features matched the description and he was picked up. Sources said Nath initially feigned ignorance and acted as a lunatic, but later confessed. 
 
 Nath said he had a few drinks on February 28 and was on his way to buy some more when he saw the boy. Nath has been charged under sections of POCSO, unnatural sex and murder. The boy’s family continues to suspect some other people of helping Nath.
