NASHIK: As the   hour for the Public Library ( ) nears an estimate of more than 3,500 members are likely to vote on Sunday to elect the new executive general body for the next five years.

 The   will be held at the library premises between 9am and 5pm on Sunday.
 
 An election officer,   said, “The library has 1,724 lifetime members and 1,856 general members who have paid their annual membership fees by February 2017. Others who paid the fees after February will miss their voting right.”
 
 Looking at the voting ratio of the previous elections, it has never crossed a 50% mark. It seems only 1,500 members will decide the fate of the 176-year old literary institution. The lowest turnout was marked at 39% in 2012. 
 
 In the meanwhile, contesting panels and independent   tried to make the most poll run-up in the last 24-hours of the campaign on Saturday.
 
 On one hand, the members of the ruling ‘Granthamitra’ panel distributed handbills and publicity material to the members of the library. The representatives of the Janasthan panel stood in the premises of the library and tried to convince the voters.
 
 The ruling president, Vilas Aurangabadkar said, “I have suspended Milind Jahagirdar and two others for their alleged involvement in the misappropriation of funds of the library. The have been proven guilty in the court of the deputy commissioner of charity as well as well as in the district court. I think, after being slammed by both the courts, Jahagirdar should now stop defaming the institution.”
 
 Jahagirdar responded that his legal battle will continue. “It is a matter of respect and dignity of the institution.”
