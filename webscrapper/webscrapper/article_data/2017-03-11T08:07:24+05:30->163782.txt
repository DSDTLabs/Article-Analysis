PERAMBALUR: The   police arrested a 31-year-old black magician and his 26-year-old wife for keeping the decomposed body of a woman at their residence in   in Perambalur on Friday. A police investigation is on to ascertain the identity of the deceased.

 Clack magician Karthik, 31, and his wife   alias Deepika, 26, were arrested by the Perambalur police after illegal possession of a body which they had kept at their residence. Curious about the foul smell emanating from his house, his neighbours checked his residence and found the body. They informed the Perambalur police who later arrived at the spot and interrogated the couple. 
 
 Karthik admitted to the police that he had brought the body from another location to perform  . Not satisfied with his responses, the police took him for further interrogation. They also seized the body which was sent to Perambalur government hospital for post-mortem. 
 
 Karthik was already embroiled in controversy pertaining to his black magic and a case had been registered against him at Paadalur police station in Perambalur in 2015 for keeping human skeletons in his house in Marudhadi area. It was said that he was running an ashram there. Later, he moved the court and got an order to run the ashram there. Yet, since his neighbours strongly objected, he was forced to shift to MM Nager with his wife. 
 
 Police registered a case under section 274, 417, 420 and 508 of IPC and arrested them on Friday evening. Police said the post-mortem would be conducted on Saturday.
