Actor  ' partner,  , has praised him on how well he has adapted to parenthood. 

 The 39-year-old actor and Lane welcomed their baby boy   - their first child together - into the world in December last year. 
 
 Although they've remained silent on parenthood since their new addition, the brunette beauty couldn't resist praising Meyers on his "protective" nature towards their son.
 
  
  
 
 Taking to her   account, Lane uploaded a photograph of the three of them and wrote: "J is thee best Father btw. Ridiculously loving, super protective, patient and attentive. Wolf is basically snuggled, kissed, adored, sang to and entertained any free minute he has by his Papa."
 
 
  
  
 
 Meyers and Lane became engaged in December 2014 and last September, it was suggested the couple had secretly tied the knot last year, but the famously private couple rarely comment on their personal life.
