TRICHY: It was evident from the way the youth were gathering near the MGR statue in support of jallikattu that they were here to make a point. Moving in procession from the collector office and Samayapuram toll gate, the students made their way to the roundabout around 10 am.

 A majority of the participants comprised students and employed youth who had taken a break from their college and work to make their voices heard aloud. Among the student protesters, many said that the issue was not restricted to mere bulls but was about saving the age-old Tamil tradition of jallikattu. 
 
 The gathering of over 3,000 students which moved to MGR statue roundabout kept swelling till afternoon. Slogans were raised against   with protesters holding placards urging the government to take concrete steps to revoke the ban on jallikattu. 
 
 There indeed were participants who had no clue about the cause and were there for mere fun. But, a majority of them said that they wanted to send a strong message to the government and that they couldn't be fooled in the name of jallikattu anymore. 
 
 While it was a social media initiative which got all of them together, college students were mobilised from across the district. J Sathish, a native of Thanjavur, works in Qatar and had come on leave. He also chose to take part in the protest and was seen distributing water packets at the venue. According to him, most of those who gathered did not know each other and yet were united for the cause. 
 
 Claiming that there was a meticulously planned conspiracy against the rustic sport, Sathish said "no one has the right to ask us to forget over a 1000-year-old tradition." He said the protest was a collective outrage against the failure of the government to safeguard the state's tradition, be it in the state or at the centre.
