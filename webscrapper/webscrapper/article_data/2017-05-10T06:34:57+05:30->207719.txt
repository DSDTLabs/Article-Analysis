ISLAMABAD: Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) said on Tuesday that it would sue Prime Minister   in the Supreme Court for receiving funds from al Qaeda chief   in the 1980s to promote jihad in Kashmir and  .

 PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhry told reporters here that he will petition the SC this week seeking admission of a case against Sharif for “taking funds from a foreign individual to destabilise and conspire against democracy in Pakistan”.
 
 English daily ‘The Express Tribune’ said PTI will submit as evidence interviews and excerpts from a book titled ‘Khalid Khawaja: Shaheed-e-Aman’ (Martyr of Peace), written by Shamama Khalid, wife of a former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy Khalid Khawaja. Khalid was murdered in 2010 by Pakistani   in North Waziristan.
 
 The book -- and interviews in it -- claim that Sharif took around Rs 1.5 billion (around $15million) from Osama bin Laden to promote jihad in Kashmir and Afghanistan.
 
 Sources further claim that later millions of dollars from this money were used to support a no-confidence move in 1989 against Benazir Bhutto, a former two-time prime minister killed in a terrorist attack in 2007 in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.
 
 Last week, PTI had also announced it would file a petition seeking implementation on a 2012 verdict of the apex court in the Asghar Khan case. The case had determined that Sharif and other politicians had received money from ISI before the 1990 general election to form an alliance against the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
 
 Chaudhry said the two cases would be filed during the ongoing week, and that he would represent his party in both.
