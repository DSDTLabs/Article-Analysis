CHENNAI: Junaid got the shock of his life on Sunday night when a man crash-landed on the bonnet of his car. The 29-year-old was driving below the Royapettah High Road flyover when Vasanth, a 31-year-old dancer, fell on the car breaking its windscreen. Vasanth had jumped off the flyover in a bid to end his life. After reaching the flyover on his bike at 9pm, he climbed on the parapet, shouted aloud saying he was ending his life and then flung himself off the bridge. A few motorists saw Vasanth shouting, but before they could rescue him, he had fallen on the car below, forcing its occupant, Junaid, to stop the car and run for cover. Junaid was returning to Kilpauk from Santhome after meeting a friend. Police said Vasanth, from Thiruvalluvar Nagar in Thiruvanmiyur, fractured his shoulder in the fall. He was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital by passers-by. During enquiries police found that Vasanth was upset over not getting married. His father Sundaram told police that his son was unhappy as none of the marriage proposals worked out. Police said Vasanth told them that his parents were not keen on getting him married either. However, Sundaram informed police that his son had been undergoing treatment for depression and been under medication. He had expressed suicidal tendencies before, police said. “He threatened to end his life several times which the family did not take it seriously. He left home asking his parents to donate his organs if he committed suicide,” said an investigating officer. Mylapore police said Vasanth was stable. They have registered a case.
