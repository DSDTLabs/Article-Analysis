PATNA: The 27th annual meeting of ‘The American Federation of Muslims of Indian Origin’ ( ) will be held in Patna in December to deliberate on newer ways and means to provide educational opportunities to Muslims in India and help them grow in political, social and vocational fields.

 The AFMI was formed as a philanthropic charity by American Muslims of Indian origin in 1989 with an avowed aim to improve the socio-economic status of the underprivileged Indian Muslims through education. 
 
 At a meeting of the organising committee on Monday, chairman Dr A A Hai said the two-day conference would be held at the S K Memorial Hall on December 22 and 23. Around 2,000 delegates, including those from the US and Canada, will attend the conference, he said and added a daylong technical session on December 20 would precede the two-day conference.
 
 The organising committee appointed Shamshad Husain, Shafi Mashadi, Arif Husain and Farhat Hasan as its vice-presidents,   as the executive secretary and   as the treasurer.
 
 The organising committee meet also adopted a resolution, saying it would request the   governor to be the patron of the conference.
 
 This is for the second time that the AFMI’s annual meet is being held in Patna which earlier hosted its 5th annual meet in 1996. The then Prime Minister H D   and senior political leaders including C M Ibrahim, Ram Vilas Paswan and Farooq Abdullah and cine actor Farookh Sheikh had participated in the 1996 conference of which the then Bihar governor A R Kidwai was the patron.
 
 Dr Hai, who was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the AFMI’s last annual conference at Jodhpur, had urged the AFMI to organise its 27th annual conference in Bihar.
