CHENNAI: The   have arrested a 36-yearold   who is charged with raping and   a 15year-old relative. The girl committed suicide on Wednesday unable to bear blackmailing by him.

 The accused, Saravanan, is married to Sasikala, the deceased girl's aunt, a police officer said.
 
 The girl had visited her aunt's house in September last year. One day , when her aunt was not at home, Saravanan offered her a soft drink which had sleeping pills. Soon after the girl fell unconscious, he raped her and captured the act on his phone.
 
 Since then, he had been threatening the girl with the video clip, police said.
 
 On Wednesday, the girl, a Class X student, committed suicide by setting herself on fire when she was alone at home. Her parents later recovered a suicide note believed to have been written by the girl.
 
 In the letter addressed to her parents, the girl said Saravanan was responsible for her death and asked them to lodge a complaint with police and get him punished. A police team which on Friday picked up Saravanan's wife too is interrogating the couple. The girl's parents who came to the police station said that she had appeared upset for the past one week before her suicide.
