AMBALA: With sports and health minister   telling finance minister   to keep off Rai sports school case making news a few days back, state   chief   preferred to avoid a direct comment on the issue.

 Barala, however, stated that there was   between both cabinet ministers. He said that, “Sometimes two ministries overlap some departments and miscommunication takes place but there is nothing as a tussle or rift between them.” The state BJP president held a meeting-cum-workshop with the party’s media department on Wednesday in order to discuss the coordination between the print, electronic and social media of the party’s media department.
 
 On GST, he termed the worries of the business class as misconceptions and added that, “The GST has been proposed after a long research and discussion conducted at the national level and no harm will be caused to the business class from it. If some shortcomings will be there then these will be removed, causing no harm to any class of society,” he added.
 
 Responding to the statements of the INLD on the SYL issue, he said that they just do not want that the BJP should get the credit for running the SYL. “The canal will be started at any cost but the INLD should support them on the issue instead of trying to create tension between the people of the two states,” he said.
 
 When asked about MP Rattan Lal Kataria calling   MP Kumari Selja as ‘laung da lishkara’, Barala said Kataria did not take the name of any specific person and added that, “All this incident is inspired by politics and MP Kataria had said nothing about any specific person”.
