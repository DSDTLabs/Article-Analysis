NEW DELHI: BJP president   today asserted that his party will form the next government in Tripura and said that development has suffered under the “misrule” of the CPM-led government in the state.

 
  "Next government in Tripura will be of the BJP. There is anger against the CPM government throughout the state, because of their misrule Tripura stands last, when it comes to development," Shah said while addressing the media in Agartala.
 
  
  
 
  The BJP president also accused CPM of resorting to violence against its party workers and said that there is an atmosphere of fear in the state.
 
  "One of our booth workers was abducted, for two days he was untraceable, after our workers pressurised the DGP we got to know that he was killed and hanged from a tree, by CPIM cadre. Authorities here work under CPIM's pressure," Shah said.
 
  Shah also spelled out the various development schemes extended to the state by the BJP-led government at Centre and said that Rs 950 crore have been granted to the state since the NDA government came to power.
 
  The BJP leader promised that if his party forms a government in the state, a degree college will be constructed in every assembly, a railway link to Bangladesh will be established to increase avenues of business in the state and a new science city will be set up in capital.
 
  Shah, who is in the state to campaign for the upcoming assembly elections scheduled to take place on February 18, further alleged that Congress is trying to divide the anti-CPM vote to prevent BJP from coming to power.
