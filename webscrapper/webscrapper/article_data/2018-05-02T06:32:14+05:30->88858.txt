CHENNAI: The city police on Tuesday arrested a repeat offender for planting 1.2kg of ganja in a car to frame a driving school owner for refusing to bribe a motor vehicle inspector in a conspiracy so implausibly dopey that investigators could be forgiven for thinking the perpetrators smoked some of the drug themselves.

 
 
  
 
 Investigators are questioning motor vehicle inspector Arunkumar and his accomplice, head constable Muthukrishnan, who they say hatched the plot to have the police arrest Jagaveerapandi Madhav, the proprietor of Modern Driving School in Mandaveli.
 
 
  
 
 They have detained Sathya alias ‘Karuvadu’, 30, from Foreshore Estate, after footage from surveillance cameras caught him placing the ganja, in two packets, in Madhav’s car parked near the driving school.
 
 
  
 
 On April 17, an investigating officer said, the   police station received an anonymous tip about ganja being smuggled in Madhav’s car. A PSI and a constable searched the car and found 1.2kg of ganja in it.
 
 “Madhav was visibly shocked that the police had seized the contraband,” the officer said. Investigators led by Kotturpuram assistant commissioner   found that camera footage from the driving school showed Sathya approach Madhav’s car on a motorcycle and drop the ganja in the vehicle.
 
 Detained for questioning, Sathya said Muthukrishnan, of the Foreshore Estate police, had coerced him into the plot at the behest of Arunkumar a motor vehicle inspector at the   office. “Madhav refused to bribe Arunkumar to sign papers at the RTO,” the officer said. “He also formed a syndicate of driving school owners to block bribes to the inspector. This angered Arunkumar and he asked Muthukrishnan, to help him to take revenge on Madhav.” 
 
 The police could soon arrest Arunkumar and Muthukrishnan, he said.
