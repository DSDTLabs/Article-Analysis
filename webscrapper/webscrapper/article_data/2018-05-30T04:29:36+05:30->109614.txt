AHMEDABAD: The year was 2009 and Ashok Jadeja, a devotee of Sikotar Mata based in the Sarkhej area, promised that with the blessing of the deity, he would triple the investments of his community. The multi-crore scam scarred thousands and Jadeja, who has served his jail sentence, is again out.

 Nine years later, two of his former aides emulated their con-guru and launched — successfully — another scheme to swindle their community’s money. This time, the sales pitch was 6% daily interest. The lock-in period was also attractively short. The accused promised to pay Rs 60,000 on every Rs 1 lakh, in just 10 days.
 
 Sarkhej police apprehended three persons, including a woman, from near   and Telav near Sanand on Monday and seized Rs 26.47 lakh cash from them, collectively. Investigators, working on information kept watch near Shantipura Circle at 12.15am and chased down a van when the driver did not stop on being flagged down by police. After a short chase, police stopped the vehicle and checked it. A woman, identified as Gayatri Didawala, a resident of  , and  , a resident of Sarkhej, along with two other persons were inside. The duo was found in possession of several envelopes, containing a total of Rs 14.7 lakh cash.
 
 “Both persons were identified as agents working for   Rathod, a resident of Telav near Sanand. A team went to Rathod’s residence and checked it, only to find another Rs 11.7 lakh in cash. A gold sword, worth Rs 85,800 was also seized. We learned that Pravin would identify himself as a ‘bhuva’ (witch doctor) and promised 6% daily returns through the blessings of a deity,” said P R Ramani, inspector of Sarkhej police station.
 
 Ramani said they have got seven or eight names of investors, in addition to the 20-odd names on the envelopes containing the money. “We are also to ascertain how much commission the agents got and whether other areas — populated by the community Rathod belongs to — have similar agents,” he said.
