MUMBAI: Five months after   fell into an   on   on a heavy rain day and drowned, the   has finalized tenders for placing protective mild   below 1,800 manholes located in low-lying, flood-prone areas. Civic officials plan to complete the work before the arrival of monsoon this year. 

 There are over one lakh   in the city, said officials. 
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal confirmed, “We plan to place protective steel nets below all drains across the city. In the first phase, we will cover only 1,800 manholes in low-lying areas and complete the work before May 15.” The BMC will spend around Rs 1.5 crore on these nets, said officials.
 
 It is pertinent to note that the BMC inquiry report on Dr Amarapurkar’s death had recommended net-like covers be placed below main   covers. In his remarks on the report, municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta had emphasized that the design for the nets be finalized within a month.
 
 Opposition leader in the BMC Ravi Raja claimed that the civic body “wakes up only when lives are lost”. “This should have been implemented long ago so that a precious life was not lost,” he said. 
 
 Activists suggested that the protective nets should have no “resale value”. “While this move has come in too late in the day, it can’t be denied that it is essential.... The BMC needs to ensure that these nets have no resale value so that they do not get stolen,” said citizen-activist G R Vora. 
 
 Advocate-activist Godfrey Pimenta said every ward should have ‘mukadams’ to monitor manholes and ensure that the covers are not removed or stolen. “The assistant municipal commissioner of each ward should conduct regular road inspections to ensure juniors do not shirk their responsibilities.”
