CHANDIGARH: Those visiting Sector 38 (West) are welcomed by a stench in the area owing to unprocessed garbage lying near the   plant. Residents fear that if there is no improvement, they will be left with no option but to sell their houses and shift to other parts of the city to avoid health hazards. 

 Residents complained that earlier the problem of foul smell was limited to the rainy season. But, from the past six months, the situation has worsened because of a mini dumping site, which has emerged on a vacant land near the residential area.
 
 K S Chaudhary, president of   said he recently visited the dispensary located in Dadumajra, where the doctors revealed that they are receiving large number of patients from the area suffering from TB, dengue, typhoid, chest congestion and malaria. He said as their sector is in Dadumajra's vicinity, the residents are afraid that they are also going to have serious health problems if the situation will not improve.
 
 Pankaj Gupta, president of Resident Welfare Association, Sector 38 (West) said whenever their relatives or friends visit them, they complaint about the unbearable odour, which they believe to be a result of a chocked sewerage pipeline. Gupta added that the visitors are explained about the reason behind the foul smell-unprocessed garabge lying near the Dadumajra plant and the recently formed mini-dumping site nearby. 
 
 Gurnam Singh Randhawa, joint secretary of RWA said initially when the plant was set up, there was hardly any residential area but now due to lack of space, the residential set-up has emerged. He added that the concerned authorities should now think about shifting the plant to somewhere else.
