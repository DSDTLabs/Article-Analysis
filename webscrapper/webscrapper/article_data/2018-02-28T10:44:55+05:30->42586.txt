PUNE: The   on Monday registered an offence against a man for sending lewd and threatening e-mails to a woman. 

 The complainant, who works for a city-based builder, alleged that the suspect has been sending her lewd e-mails since November. “The woman had ignored these e-mails and did not respond to it,” an officer from the Deccan Gymkhana police said. 
 
 But things took a sinister turn when the suspect sent her an e-mail in which he threatened to rape her. That was when the terrified woman informed her colleagues and relatives before approaching the police. 
 
 The police have booked the suspect under section 354 (A) (sexual harassment), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Information and Technology (IT) Act.
 
 
 
 
 The   police on Monday booked against a labourer, who works for a catering contractor, for repeatedly raping his 29-year-old co-worker.
 
 The police said that the suspect came to know that the woman doesn’t live with her husband. “Under the pretext of talking to her, the suspect took her to a room on February 14 and raped her. After that, he started blackmailing her and raped her many times. The woman came to us and lodged the complaint,” a police officer said.
 
 The suspect, who is on the run, has been booked under section 376 (rape) of the IPC. “Further probe is on,” the officer said.
