MARGAO: Fatorda Block Congress Committee (FBCC) president and Congress candidate for Fatorda, Joseph Silva on Sunday said that the present legislator   did no development at Fatorda during his incumbency and Sardesai was spreading rumours as he saw his impending defeat in the coming elections. 

 “Last elections, I had supported him, so I am aware of the internal developments. Sardesai went to (defence minister)   as he has good internal relations with him. Besides, BJP and Congress are both national parties so how can Congress be the ‘B team’ of BJP? I fail to understand this logic,” said Silva, speaking to media persons on Sunday. He also expressed his gratitude to the state Congress leaders and the party high command for reposing their faith and granting him the party nomination in Fatorda.
 
 Goa Forward Party (GFP) Fatorda candidate Sarddesai, on Saturday, had lashed out at the   (GPCC) president and Congress’ Navelim candidate  , as the proposed alliance talks between Congress and the regional GFP failed. 
 
 Sardesai had accused Faleiro of having a secret deal with BJP in order to save himself from being chargesheeted in the special economic zone (SEZ) case, filed against the former industries minister by current defence minister Manohar Parrikar at the Panaji police station. He also termed the SEZ scam as ‘a joint venture between Congress and BJP, wherein Goan land was sold at a pittance to set up industries’.
