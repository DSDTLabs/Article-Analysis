KOCHI: To save Kochi, at least the central city area, from flooding this monsoon, Metro Man E   has come up with a proposal to desilt Mullassery canal, which carries a chunk of stormwater from various drains in the area. He will mobilize funds for the purpose with the help of   (DMRC) and some NGOs.

 Mayor   got a letter from Sreedharan informing that he would take up the project provided the   gives its nod for it. “We had held three or four rounds of talks with Sreedharan for finding a solution to the waterlogging issue. As a prelude, Sreedharan along with, PWD, NHAI and Corporation officials had conducted site visit a few weeks ago.
 
 “Earlier, there were many outlets of drains opening to the backwaters along the stretch. The outlets collapsed, clogged or disappeared due to various reasons over the years. If we provide outlets to the backwaters at certain points along the stretch, waterlogging in the highprofile areas like MG Road, High Court and Ernakulathappan temple can be reduced. It was found,” a source said.
 
 Later, Sreedharan found that desilting Mullassery canal would solve the issue of waterlogging in the central zone. “Sreedhar has expressed hope that the work can be completed before monsoon provide the corporation gives its nod. So, the corporation council will have to give its nod soon,” he said.
 
 There are also plans to seek the help of renowned entomologist Dr K N Panicker for mosquito eradication drive in the Kochi corporation. A few years ago, Panicker had conducted a study and prepared a master plan for addressing mosquito menace in Kochi. But, the corporation authorities did nothing to implement the project. A fresh study should be conducted given the fact that the situation has changed after conducting the earlier study. An action plan will have to be charted out based on new studies.
