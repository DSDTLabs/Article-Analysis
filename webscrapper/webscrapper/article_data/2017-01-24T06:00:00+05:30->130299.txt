Nagpur: Amol Mitkari, state convener of  , on Monday justified vandalizing playwright Ram Ganesh Gadkari’s statue in Pune.

 “The playwright had insulted Sambhaji by depicting him as a characterless person in his play Rajsanyas. Statue of such a person should not be present in the park named after Sambhaji. We have no objection if Gadkari’s statue is installed in his ancestral home in Saoner,” he said addressing a press conference.
 
 The Sambhaji Brigade leader however, was at pains to explain why Gadkari’s statue was vandalized 90 years after the playwright wrote the play. “Our people have just read it and found out that it is highly objectionable.,” Mitkari said.
 
 adding that the Brigade’s act had nothing to do with coming municipal elections.
 
 The Brigade has demanded that Shiv Sena should celebrate Shivaji’s birthday as per Gregorian calendar and not as per Hindu calendar (tithi) “Balasaheb Thackeray’s birthday is celebrated on the calendar day,” he said. Mitkari also demanded that Sena put Shivaji’s portrait above Balasaheb’s in Sena Bhavan, Mumbai.
 
 The Brigade warned that it would again disrupt staging of play ‘Hey Ram, Nathuram’ on Tuesday and justified the attempt to stop it on Sunday. “Sharad Ponkshe is encouraging radical forces who killed Pansare, Dabholkar and Kalburgi,” Mitkari added.
