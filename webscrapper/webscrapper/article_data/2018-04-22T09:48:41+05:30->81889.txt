CHENNAI: The Madras high court recently enhanced the compensation awarded to a bilateral amputee from Rs 20 lakhs to Rs 45 lakhs, as he has to depend on another person even for day-today tasks such as to attend nature's call. 

 R Nagaraj, 32, who was a cleaner-cum-load man for a mini lorry, sustained severe injuries in a road accident involving a   ( ) bus and a two-wheeler in 2009.
 
  The accident was reported on Hosur-Bengaluru Highways. Both his legs had to be amputated in the subsequent surgical procedures during treatment. 
 
 Three years later, the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Chennai awarded a compensation of 20.9 lakh to the accident victim. 
 
 Following this, the insurance firm,   which was to bear the costs, filed a civil miscellaneous appeal with the Madras high court against the tribunal's order. 
 
 Hearing this petition last week, the division bench comprising Justices N Kirubakaran and R Pongiappan enhanced the compensation to 45 lakhs, as he would not be in a position to move on his own and has to depend on attendants even for nature's calls for the rest of his life. 
 
 Referring to a   judgement, the bench said that the enhanced amount includes 10 lakhs towards attendant charges and nursing expenses, and another 5 lakhs to Nagaraj's wife for loss of material pleasure. 
 
 The high court bench asked the insurance firm to deposit the entire amount or due amount (if a compensation has been paid already), along with interest, to the victim's bank account within four weeks from the date of receipt of the order copy.
