NEW DELHI: An expert committee set up by the Union home ministry to suggest ways to tackle online hate speech following striking down of the controversial Section 66A of Information Technology Act has recommended appointing   coordinators in all states as well as setting up of anti-cyber crime cells at the district level.

 The committee, headed by former   secretary general T K Viswanathan, also suggested amendments to the IT Act and some sections of IPC including Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and Section 505A (false and mischievous reports intended to upset public tranquility) to cover hate speech through electronic means, official sources said.
 
 An   spokesperson said the report has been received and is under examination.
 
 The committee has recommended that a team of state-level cyber crime coordinators and district anti-cyber crime cells be prepared to deal with those fomenting trouble or spreading hate against anybody on the grounds of religion, race, caste or community, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, place of birth or residence, language, disability, or tribe through any means of communication.
 
 The punishment dealing with prohibiting incitement to hatred has been recommended to be two yearsâ€™ imprisonment or a fine of Rs 5,000 or both, according to a PTI report. The panel has further suggested that offences under the amended Section 505A be punishable with imprisonment of up to one year or fine or Rs 5,000 or both.
