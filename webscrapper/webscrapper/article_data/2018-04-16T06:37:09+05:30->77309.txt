CHANDIGARH: CM   on Sunday hit out at SAD president   for questioning his style of functioning, saying he did not need any lessons from the former deputy CM on how to govern.

 “Given his own total failure on the governance front, as was evident from the complete mess the erstwhile government had plunged the state into,   had no locus standi to comment on anyone’s governance style,” the CM said in a statement here.
 
 
 At a political conference at   in   on Saturday, Sukhbir had questioned Amarinder’s style of functioning and alleged that he had no control over the government and that bureaucracy and police top brasses were having a free run.
 
 The CM said that unlike the   led by the Badals, he believed in giving his civil and police administrations a free hand to function so that they can work effectively. “The bureaucrats and police had been totally stifled by the Badals,” he alleged, and added that if that was the “control” Sukhbir was referring to, then he was happy and proud not to be exercising that.
