Ahmedabad: Panic was stirred in security agencies after an unknown person was spotted recently by local residents in the border areas of Kutch. According to sources in security agencies, three days ago some people of Khadir — an area near the Indo-Pak border — reported to police that a stranger, about six feet tall, was roaming around freely. “We swung into action and informed other security agencies and the Border Security Force (BSF),” said a senior Kutch Police official. “We launched a manhunt to nab the suspect, but could not trace him.”

 According to sources, people in Khavda district of Kutch — also near the Indo-Pak border — have reported spotting a person matching the description of the Khadir mystery man. “We have activated our human intelligence network in the area,” said a senior official. He said said that the shadowy figure seems to be moving about alone.
 
 A few days ago, central intelligence agencies had issued an alert about a possible infiltration bid by Pakistan-based terrorists through the Kutch border. “We are taking the input seriously and have formed several teams of plainclothes officers to monitor the border areas of Kutch,” the official said. 
 
 The input is worrying because recently about 21 Pakistani fishing boats were seized from the creek area in Kutch. Two Pakistani fishermen were arrested. “Infiltration of Pakistani fishermen is always a serious issue as they act as eyes and ears for the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan,” a source from the BSF said. “They can give vital information about security deployment to the ISI.”
