Pune: The   ( ) will install 130 more closed-circuit television cameras, mostly at newly constructed as well as old schools, hospitals and other public places within its jurisdiction for security purpose.

 There are close to 200 closed-circuit television cameras ( ) in the cantonment limits at present.
 
 Based on a survey report for new CCTV surveillance spots, the board has floated a tender for the installation work. “By the second fortnight of May, we expect to complete the tender process. The total expenditure would be around Rs15 lakh,” said Yadav.
 
 Cantonment residents and some activists have been demanding more cameras at schools, particularly after a case of molestation of a schoolgirl was reported at Ghorpadi School on April 14.
 
 Activist   said, “It is a positive move but these cameras should be connected to local police stations so that they can take timely action, if required.”
 
 A senior board member said, “The board has been spending lakhs of rupees on purchasing cameras every year but it has not delivered the desired result because several cameras, after a certain period, become defunct. The board officials need to conduct reviews regularly.”
