Vasco:   sitting below the heritage clock tower in Vasco have to face the brunt of the summer heat during the day and struggle through darkness after dusk as their electricity connection was cut two years ago, when restoration work of the clock tower began.

 Prakash Kamle, who for the last three decades has been mending and polishing shoes at the same spot, said, “Our electricity connection was cut about two years ago when the repair work started and not restored till date”. 
 
 Around 10 cobblers run their business below the tower and a couple of them sit outside the structure. Usually they would work until 9pm, but with no electricity, they have to wind up business by 7pm. The summer heat makes their working enviroment worse as the cobblers, many of whom are senior citizens, cannot attach wall fans. Another cobbler Damodar Mane said, “We have hung pictures of God on the walls where we work. In the dark, after we leave, drunkards and passersby even urinate here”.
 
 When questioned, MMC vice-chairperson Shashikant Parab assured that he will take up the matter with the chairperson and chief officer as soon as possible.
