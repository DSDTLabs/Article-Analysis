Surat: Three milk cooperative mandalis of Olpad taluka in Surat district have been issued income tax (I-T) notices, asking them to pay taxes on interest earned on their fixed deposits with the banks. Cooperative leaders say this will break the backbone of the cooperative movement in the state.  Pinjrat Seva Mandali, Koba Dudh Mandali and Kudiyana Dudh Utpadak Mandali have been asked to pay up 30 per cent on the interest earned for assessment years 2014-15 and 2015-16 by the I-T department. There are about 5,000 cooperative milk mandalis in Surat district which supply milk to Surat District Co-Operative Milk Producer’s Union Limited (SUMUL). The working capital of these mandlis — formed 50 years ago — comes either from equity of shareholders or Rs 150 crore in interest earned on the fixed deposits of farmer members with the banks. “Fixed deposits of farmers are kept with the district cooperative banks. If 30 per cent I-T is demanded on the interest earned on them, it will break the backbone of cooperative movement in the region. The demand for about Rs 50 crore tax from milk cooperatives in Surat district means that I-T department would soon start sending notices to other district cooperatives too,” Gujarat Khedut Samaj president Jayesh Patel said.  “Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail has been allowed by the government, but in Gujarat where the cooperatives are strong, foreign retailers would not succeed until the cooperatives are finished. SUMUL has annual turnover of Rs 3,000 crore and to destroy it, small milk cooperatives need to be broken. This is what this government is planning to do. The issue of I-T notices to sugar cooperatives has not yet been resolved, but the I-T department is ready with more problems,” SUMUL director Jayesh Delad Patel said
