Bathinda: The Muktsar district police have arrested two persons of a Bathinda village for scripting a false snatching story and have recovered the money, which they had claimed was taken away from them. The duo — Gurtej Singh and Kuldeep Singh of village Faridkot Kotkli in Bathinda, had claimed that five persons near village Killianwali in Muktsar snatched Rs 4.80 lakh from them on January 16. Both work as building contractors and had told police that they had withdrawn the money from HDFC Bank at village Badal just before they were looted. Muktsar SSP Sushil Kumar said that working on Gurtej and Kuldeep’s complaint police got suspicious of their story and thoroughly inquired into the matter from all angles. SSP said both the contractors had to pay the money to a mason of village Killianwali. They had called him up saying they were coming to give him the money. However, as they were not willing to pay, they planned to script a false snatching story .
