 The sale of   tobacco goes unchecked in Mohali. The scented, flavoured, and chewable varieties of the harmful product continue to be sold under the covers.

 The excise and taxation commissioner has ordered to take strict action against the illicit trade of tobacco. Scented, flavoured, as well as chewable tobacco is banned in  , yet available at various points of sale. TOI found in a reality check that banned tobacco brands S-4, S-10, Dabang, and S-Plus were available in town in violation of the Food Safety and Standards Act.
 
 Smuggled packs of Black, Mond, Marso, Gudang Garam, Dunhill, and Pine cigarette are also available on the market. These cigarettes don’t meet the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003, because their packs have no graphic health warning of required specifications. Roadside vendors continue to stock these brands of cigarette. The excise and taxation commissioner had also ordered strict action against the wholesalers who of illicit tobacco products and written to the assistant commissioners of his department to raid the supplies and retailers as well.
 
 The government of Punjab was no kind of tobacco sold in the state. Working since 1996 for tobacco control, Mohali-based non-government organisation (NGO)   has even provided the director of investigation in the excise and taxation department with evidence of the stocking and supply of banned tobacco products and requested him to take firm action. Reacting to it, the state authority concerned issued a directive order to various officers that they must comply with the state government’s notification.
