NAGPUR: Saoner MLA   on Thursday, withdrew his plea from Nagpur bench of   challenging amendment being carried out in Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. 

 The move came after the court grilled him on the fact that one other PIL by Omprakash Kamdi through Shreerang Bhandarkar was already pending. The HC had already directed the government to complete the enquiry under Section 88 of the Act in Rs150 crore   (NDCCB) scam, where he was made one of the accused. 
 
 The petitioner had raised objection on applying the amendment retrospectively to the ongoing enquiry in NDCCB scam, which was one of the biggest cooperative scandals of the country at that time allegedly involving top politicians.
 
 According to Kedar, the divisional registrar appointed senior auditor of  , Yashwant Bagde, to conduct enquiry into the scam on May 13, 2002. He nailed Kedar, who was holding bank chairmanâ€™s post at that time, along with its bank general manager and 27 others in the scam on November 28, 2013. Later, the Department of Cooperatives directed Kedar to cough up around Rs299 crore for the loss caused to the bank due to bungling in purchase of government securities.
