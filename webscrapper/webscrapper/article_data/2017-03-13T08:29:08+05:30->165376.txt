RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: In another show of unity between Kadva and  , the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) organized a massive roadshow in Patel-dominated Jamnagar district and announced intensifying their agitation for quota. 

 Hardik also conducted the ritualistic idol installation ceremony of Maa Umiya and   in Dhrol town where the 25km roadshow that began from Jodiya culminated on Sunday. 
 
 Maa Umiya is the community deity of Kadva Patels while Leuvas worship Maa Khodal.
 
 Launching a tirade against BJP, Hardik said it was unbecoming of such a big political party of create constraints in his roadshows and rallies. 
 
 “People of Gujarat are with us and they are mature enough to understand the political tactics of the BJP. The people will give a befitting reply to the BJP in the 2017 state assembly elections,” he said, addressing a gathering of Patidars in Dhrol.
 
 In a throwback to Bahujan   (BSP) supremo Mayawati’s recent allegation, Hardik also said that if the BJP has guts it should encourage use of ballot paper rather than electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the state assembly election.
 
 “I had started the agitation because people from Patidar community have not been getting government jobs. The fight to include Patidars under OBC category will continue until we get our right and our youths get government jobs,” he said.
 
 Hardik also announced that PAAS would organize a GMDC-ground like public meet in Surat on March 19 and that he would also start holding public meets in Mehsana after court grants him permission to go ahead. Hardik was accused of triggering violence in Visnagar town of Mehsana during the quota agitation in August 2015 and a local court barred him from addressing public gatherings in the district.
 
 The 23-year-old Patel leader also said that he will begin another phase of quota agitation in Rajkot at the end of April after the exams end.
