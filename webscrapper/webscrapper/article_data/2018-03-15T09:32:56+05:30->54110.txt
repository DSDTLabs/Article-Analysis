HYDERABAD: Hyderabad police log nearly 30 child abuse cases, on an average, in a month. Of them, nearly 15% cases might be severe in nature. Last year, the Hyderabad SHE Teams had recorded 65 severe child abuse cases.

 According to Hyderabad police, the child abuse cases were on the rise. Though several cases were being reported to police, city-based child rights activists claim nearly 40% child abuse cases go unreported.
 
 “There are several social factors related to this issue. In the state, there is no childfriendly environment in schools and communities, where children can speak up comfortably. Though this year there were three cases of sexual abuse of children at schools, yet we still lack proper safety mechanisms in place,”  , a city-based child rights activist, said.
 
 Last year, over 250 cases of child abuse were reported in the Hyderabad police commissionerate limits. Shockingly, of 28 cases under trial last year, only five accused were convicted. According to police, 70% of child victims were in the 14-17 age group, while the most difficult cases were those of victims less than age seven.
 
 “We get, on an average, 25 to 30 cases of child abuse in a month. Though the number appears to be high, most of them are related to elopement. Also, less than 15% cases are severe in nature,” assistant commissioner of police ( ), SHE Teams, D   said.
 
 Police have least access to children, the activist said, adding parents need to be more careful and understand their behavioural changes.
 
 “Most children do not speak up about the abuse. The parents should make their children comfortable and give assurance that they speak about such instances. Sex education is important for children so that they know about good and bad touch,” Bhargavi added.
