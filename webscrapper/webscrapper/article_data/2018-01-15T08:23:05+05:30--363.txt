KOCHI: In order to ensure that all government and aided schools in the district have art teachers, director of public instruction (DPI), KV   said that education department along with the culture department would launch a joint project to ensure that arts graduates would be recruited at the institutions.

 The DPI said that the project aimed to impart training in painting, theatre, dance and music to students by employing qualified professionals. "The aim is to have teachers on board, who can identify talented students. For this we have also conducted a workshop in scriptwriting and film appreciation, so that teachers can be provided an insight in recognising talent in schools. Once these students are identified, we will give an opportunity to nurture their talent through various platforms," said Mohankumar.
 
 He said that the department officials had met culture minister   and education minister   in this regard. "The main focus is on dance and theatre. We will recruit from among those who pass out from cultural institutions such as the   and fine arts," said Mohankumar.
 
 "Presently, many graduates from art institutions are unemployed. Though they are very talented, many don not have regular source of income, he observed, adding that the project would be kicked off from next academic year.
 
 Also, the department would hire teachers under the   ( ) scheme for music and painting.
 
 The recruitment of art education teachers is in addition to the Talent Lab programme to be launched next academic year.
