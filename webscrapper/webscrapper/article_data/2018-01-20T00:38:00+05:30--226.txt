Pune: As many as 14 city-based poetry clubs are coming together to perform for free on Saturday at Lost the Plot, Aundh.

 The event will celebrate the contribution of the open air theatre in popularising new age poetry in the city. The poetry reading — in Hindi, English, Marathi and Urdu— will begin at 6.30pm. This will be one of the last shows to be organised at the venue.
 
 “Lost the Plot has been one of the main reasons behind the rise of the poetry scene in the city. The venue is among the first to give a real boost to both professional and amateur poets by providing a free and open platform to them. Lost the plot began with ‘Bullock Cart’ doing their open mic series ‘Get up and Speak’ in 2016. Ever since, the poets who assembled there have gone to become famous in their own right, with some even starting their own poetry clubs,” said Chandrakant Redican, co-founder of Bullock Cart Poetry.
 
 “This is the poetry community’s way of thanking Lost the Plot. Around 14 poetry clubs will join the event to celebrate poetry, get to know each other and collaborate. Besides seasoned poets, an open mic will be held for first-timers in the scene,” said a statement from the organisers.
