Margao: The director of panchayats Gurudas Pilarnekar said that the Rumdamol-Davorlim panchayat’s act of denying permission to put up banners, flags or photographs of Chatrapati Shivaji on the occasion of Shiv Jayanti celebrations was ‘improper’ and ‘suspended’ the panchayat’s resolution. The order was passed on a petition filed by a Rumdamol resident Mantesh Ragi.

 Ragi had complained to the director of the panchayats against the Rumdamol-Davorlim panchayat, which cited a resolution passed by it not to issue any permissions to put up banner of kings/maharajas in the jurisdiction of the panchayat for denying permission to Ragi.
 
  “Shivaji Maharaj has recognition in Parliament as ‘Chatrapati’. In view of the above, the act of village panchayat Davorlim not to allow display of banners, flags, photos, etc of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the jurisdiction of village panchayat Davorlim is improper,” reads the judgement.
 
 Pilarnekar, in his judgement, found fault with the panchayat for failing to convene a meeting of the panchayat to decide on the application of the petitioner.
 
 The order states that the letter issued by the sarpanch of village panchayat Rumdamol-Davorlim to the applicant informing him about denial of permission, “is set aside, being improper.”
