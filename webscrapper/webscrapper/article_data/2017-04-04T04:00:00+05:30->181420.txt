Vadodara: Sumandeep Vidyapeeth’s founder and cash-for-marks scam accused Dr Mansukh Shah withdrew his bail plea from sessions court here on Monday. Shah had filed for bail on March 17, when his aide Ashok Tailor’s bail plea was being heard by the court. 

 Tailor’s bail application was rejected by the court in the same case on March 23. The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had filed two affidavits in the court opposing the bail application. The affidavit had revealed several details of the investigation of the case. During previous hearing on March 27, the agency had filed the second affidavit which said that Shah had defied charity commissioner’s order to not take fees in cash.
 
 After the second affidavit was filed, Shah’s lawyer had asked for another date to study the affidavit and give their reply. The court was to hear further arguments on Monday but the plea was withdrawn when it came for hearing. Shah in his bail has claimed his non-involvement in case of taking Rs 20 lakh from the complainant.
 
 He has been in Vadodara Central Jail since March 6, during which he had also filed a petition in court seeking permission for home-cooked food and boiled water since he practices Jainsim. However, that plea was rejected by the court.
