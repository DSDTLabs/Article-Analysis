CHANDIGARH: Many of the signs installed on the roadsides, pavements, and medians at various points in the city are so tattered that they are confusing the commuters more than guiding them.

 A speed limit sign 24 for two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws on the Udyan Path between Sector 23 lies broken for the past several months. When   sought to know about it, the nearby residents said looking at the nature of the damage, the tearing of the sign appeared deliberate. “It might be an act of vandalism,” said  , a nearby resident. “The road sign is severely punctured. It has taken a violent impact. Maybe one of the miscreants who roam about has done it. I have been watching the torn sign for months now.”
 
 “Maybe somebody pelted the sign with stones to damage it. It appears that way,” said a passerby. Paint has come off a sign on the median of Sectors 22 and 17. This board near the Sector 17-22-18 roundabout has chipped off partially. Incomplete information confuses the commuters. This sign should read   but many people can’t make that out,” said  , a passerby.
 
 A number of other road signs in the city have also been vandalised with spray paint city and have become confusing to decipher. A sign near the Children’s Traffic Park in Sector 23, in an area which has a high deployment of traffic police, lies smashed. Speaking to TOI, a passerby said: “Chandigarh is such a beautiful city that I wonder who can gather the courage to destroy public property in this manner. It is highly disappointing. The city’s road signs and direction pointers are of a lot of help to the commuters. They are traveller friendly and vandalising these is an ugly and irresponsible act. The administration should not wait for months to repair these signs. It should have taken care of the problem promptly.”
 
 When this correspondent asked around for any clue to who could damage the signs, none of the nearby residents admitted to filing a complaint with the authorities concerned.
