Panaji: A passenger cruise boat with 42 tourists and crew members on board drifted off course and crashed into offshore casino Deltin Jaqk. Luckily, both vessels did not suffer any damage.  The passengers were brought on board the casino vessel to safety. They were later moved to the Panaji Captain of Ports jetty, using the feeder boats of the casinos. “Because of strong currents, the boat drifted towards the casino vessel instead of the jetty. Thankfully nothing grave happened and no damage occurred,” captain of ports James Braganza said. The incident occurred around 6.30pm on Saturday, when the pleasure boat was returning from a cruise. The boat, identified by officials as Om Sai, struggled to counter the currents and struck the casino vessel that was moored nearby. The passengers were later transferred to the jetty by the vessel operators.
