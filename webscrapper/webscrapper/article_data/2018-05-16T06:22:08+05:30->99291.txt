MUMBAI: Maharashtra Lok Ayukta M L Tahaliyani has summoned Mhada CEO Milind Mhaiskar on May 23 to record evidence in an inquiry into charges that housing minister Prakash Mehta cleared an irregular   scheme at  's M P Mill Compound. 

 
  Mhaiskar was holding additional charge of   (SRA) when TOI reported on his controversial order which was stayed by chief minister   on July 12, 2017. Sources said the body may seek further details.
 
  The Lok Ayukta probe was ordered following Opposition pressure. TOI's expose said Mehta's decision to allow building rights granted to slum-dwellers at the compound to be transferred to project-hit people went against development control rules. The housing department had objected to the move. But Mehta cleared the proposal on June 21, 2017. He had written on the file, "The chief minister has been informed." He later backtracked.
 
  Mehta sought to blame additional chief secretary (housing) Sanjay Kumar. He claimed that if his noting differed from that of the housing department, the additional chief secretary should have brought it to his attention. Kumar said the minister's clearance was in violation of slum redevelopment rules.
