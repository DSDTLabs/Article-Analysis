NEW DELHI: The Delhi Commission for Women ( ) has summoned the   of Hindu   to appear before it on Wednesday in response to the notices sent to the college asking about the “exorbitant and unequal fees” of the newly constructed girls’ hostel. 

 The organisation has also written to the University Grant’s Commission (UGC) chairperson about the issue.
 
 The student collective Pinjra Tod had written to DCW about “the discriminatory rules for girls” at Hindu College, and the college was sent a notice on February 17. The college had replied that the girls’ hostel was constructed without any financial assistance from UGC and hence the   was higher than the boys’ hostel. The college had also assured it will take steps to ensure non-discriminatory and equitable rules for both boys and girls. 
 
 DCW was then informed that the administration had shut down the girl’s hostel. On this, another notice was sent on June 22, seeking a report. But after several weeks, the commission did not receive it.
 
 The college reopened the hostel after the start of the new session. A few days later, Pinjra Tod members alleged that the fees remained very high, prompting the DCW to summon the college administration and seek explanation for the delay in giving the information.
 
 The DCW also informed the UGC “many institutions still do not have hostel facilities for girls,” and asked the UGC to intervene in the matter and issue necessary directions. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, principal of Hindu College Anju Srivastava said that “I am yet to receive the summons and will comment on it after I read it."
