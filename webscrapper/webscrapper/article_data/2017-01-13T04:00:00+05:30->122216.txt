Vadodara: The Jail Road that is one of the major connections between the eastern and western parts of the city will soon offer a hassle-free ride. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is set to nearly double the width of the road.

 The road connects Kalaghoda bridge to Dandia Bazaar and was once a part of the national highway. The road passes near important government buildings as well as the property of the royal Gaekwad family. The buildings on the road include the Narmada Bhavan, Police Bhavan, Vadodara Central Jail, SSG Hospital and its hostels, City Telephone Exchange as well as land belonging to the Gaekwad family.
 
 The VMC had recently written to all having property on the road and expressed its intentions of widening the road. VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that a decision to widen the road was taken about two decades back, but had not materialised so far. “We plan to widen the road from the present 24 meters to 40 meters,” said Rao.
 
 While the acquisition of land of government properties was not a major problem as the then district collector Anil Mukim had done the needful, the VMC officials held a meeting with scion of the royal Gaekwad family Samarjitsinh Gaekwad. “They are cooperating with the project and will take back the grills as well as gates of the palace compound on the road. Additional floor-space index for any future development on the land has been sought by them,” said Rao.
 
 Work on removing the grills was started on Thursday by the royal family. 
 
 In the past the grills on the Lalbaug Road were razed by the civic body to widen the road there. Palace compound’s land was also acquired for the Akota-Dandia Bazaar road connectivity project.
 
 VMC officials also held a meeting with the district collector Lochan Sehra regarding the project. 
 
 The widening project will also be discussed with the jail authorities.
