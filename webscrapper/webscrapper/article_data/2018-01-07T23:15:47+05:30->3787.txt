 The gangster claimed that he had been framed in false cases and that to date, not even a single witness had deposed in the court to prove the charges.
 
 "Now, if police want me to do some major crime, I shall kill Salman Khan and that too in Jodhpur," he added.
 
 Bishnoi's death threat to Salman is being linked with the black buck killing case of 1998, in which Salman and his co-actors are accused. It was the Bishnoi community which had brought up the  , and ever since the community considers the Bollywood actor a "villain".
 
 However, some onlookers felt that the gangster talked of killing Salman just to create a sensation.

 Bishnoi is a notious gangster and has been charged in over 20 cases of attempt to murder, carjacking, extortion, snatching and under the Arms Act in   belt.
