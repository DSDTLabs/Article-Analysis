CHENNAI: An advocate, who filed a public interest litigation that led to a blanket ban on registration of unapproved layouts throughout  , has complained to the Madras high court that he has been receiving threats from some lawyers and unknown people. 

 Activist and advocate Elephant G Rajendran made a mention of the threats before the first bench of the court on Tuesday morning. 
 
 The bench of acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice R Mahadevan asked him to file his complaint in the form of a memo, as they could take cognizance of oral submissions.
 
 Acting on Rajendranâ€™s PIL, the Madras high court on September 9 last directed registration officials not to register any property not having DTCP approval. It also disallowed resale of buildings constructed on unauthorised layouts. It put a freeze on the indiscriminate conversion of agricultural lands to housing plots without adhering to mandatory norms. 
 
 The order has brought the thriving unapproved layouts sector into a grinding halt. It has been estimated that more than four lakh unapproved housing plots, worth several hundred crores of rupees, are lying unsold in various parts of the state.
 
 The bench on Tuesday also remarked that authorities needed to keep in mind the fact that laws governing the field were old and that amenities such as road needed to be made for new areas.
