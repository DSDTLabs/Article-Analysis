PUNE: Fraudsters operating from West Bengal   about Rs 1.04 lakh from a manager working with a   here recently.

 Imran Bagwan (34), a resident of Vadgaon Sheri, received four transaction alerts on the intervening night of March 14 and 15 about the transfer of money from his   held with a private bank to various bank accounts outside Maharashtra.
 
 What perplexed the victim was that he had neither shared his bank account number, Personal Identification Number (PIN) and other sensitive details with anyone nor did he receive any one time passwords (OTPs) on his mobile phone for the four transactions. 
 
 All he received were the transaction alerts that he saw early on the morning of March 15 and immediately approached the city police’s cybercrime branch.
 
 Following an investigation that went on for more than a month-and-a-half, the cybercrime branch on Wednesday lodged an FIR with the Yerawada police against three suspects, hailing from West Bengal, for siphoning off the money from Bagwan’s bank account.
 
 Yerawada police inspector Ashok Kadam told TOI, “The investigators have prima facie ascertained the identities of the suspects but the possibility of these names being fake cannot be ruled out. Three of the money transfers were to bank accounts in   and another in a bank account in Jharkhand. The suspects may have used bogus identities to open bank accounts.”
 
 Kadam said, “The suspects were tech savvy and managed to break the security codes of the account held with a private bank branch at Bund Garden Road as well as the secured online system. We are investigating the case and a search has been launched,” he said.
 
 The officer added that it was strange that Bagwan had not shared any details relating to his bank account and yet his money got transferred to other bank accounts.
