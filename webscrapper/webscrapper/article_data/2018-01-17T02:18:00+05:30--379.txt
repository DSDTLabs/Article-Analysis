Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is set to start audio advertisement in five gardens in the city. The proposal will come up for discussion in the standing committee on Friday. The concept is likely to be introduced in remaining gardens in a phased manner.

 As per the proposal submitted by the advertisement department, audio advertisements will be played out in the gardens every 15 minutes for 2.5 hours each in the morning and evening hours.
 
 The advertisement department hopes to earn Rs25,000 per annum from the five gardens — Tulsibagh, Cotton Market, Gandhisagar Lake, Lakadganj and Balaji Nagar.
 
 RTI activist TH Naidu, a senior citizen and a daily visitor to a garden, slammed the proposal. “Citizens come to walk, sit, talk and exercise in the gardens. With advertisements playing out, gardens will n longer be peaceful. Who is going to verify whether audio advertisement is being played for 15 minutes or more. Also, who will screen the content of advertisement,” he asked.
 
 Another important proposal is to appoint Wardha-based Peoples For Animals for sterilization of dogs even though it has not participated in the tendering process. If appointed, it will be the third agency. The NMC had issued a work order to the city-based Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) after the tendering process. Work order to Karad-based Vets For Animal is in the final stages.
 
 The process to decide the exit of 8 of the total 16 members from the standing committee through a lucky draw system will also be held at the meeting.
