NEW DELHI. Industrialist   on Sunday volunteered to execute rapists and murderers of young girls in the country.

 Venting his emotions on the recent rape cases that have gripped the country, the chairman of Mahindra group tweeted, “The job of executioner is not an aspirational job. But for the execution of brutal rapists & murderers of young girls I would volunteer unhesitatingly.”
 
 Reacting specifically to the rape of a 9-year-old girl in Surat, whose dead body was found last week with 86 injury marks, Mahindra claimed that despite trying hard to maintain a calm persona, his blood boils to see this happen in India.
 
  
  
 The Surat incident comes at a time when the nation is witnessing widespread protests against the government's alleged inaction in the rape-and-murder of an eight-year-old nomadic girl in   and Kashmir's   district.
 
 The outrage was also fuelled by the arrest of a sitting MLA from the BJP last week in connection with the rape of a teenager in   district of Uttar Pradesh, a state governed by the BJP.
