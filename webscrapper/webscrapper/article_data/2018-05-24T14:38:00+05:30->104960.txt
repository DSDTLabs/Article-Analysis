COIMBATORE: Neither the age nor the confinement to the four walls of the city central prison were barriers for a section of its inmates, who wanted to prove their mettle amidst difficulties. And their perseverance has paid off as 47 of them have cleared the Class X examination hands down.

 Of the 49 inmates, who appeared for the examination, 34 were life convicts in murder cases and three, under-trail prisoners, said an official with the Coimbatore Central Prison. All the inmates, who have cleared the examination, would apply for the Class XI examination next year.
 
 It was K Pichaipandi alias Mukesh, 34, a resident of   district, who secured the first place among the inmates. An illiterate,   showed interest in studies only after spending a decade in the prison, the official said.
 
 “Initially, he was very reluctant to study. But as days passed by, she gradually showed interest in studies,” the official said.
 
 Citing that he was confident that Mukesh would come first, the official said the prisoner had taken his Class VIII examination only previous year. “During the initial stages, the inmates prefer work to studies. It is only after continuous counselling, their attitude changes,” the official added.
 
 The stories of  , 26, and  , 27, who have secured second and third places among the inmates, aren’t any different either. Life convicts in murder cases, they were lodged in the prison in 2017.
