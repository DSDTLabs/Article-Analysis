 This is not the first time they have posted a romantic picture, they keep posting their lovey-dovey pictures on Instagram and other social media accounts. The two had even raised many eyebrows by getting intimate on the reality series.
 
 Puneesh had spoken very openly about how he feels for Bandgi in an interview with the Times of India, wherein he had said, "She is so beautiful. Where will I ever get a girl like her? People might say that she fell for my money, but I know that she really loves me. And if you feel that other couples on Bigg Boss were faking it, I would not know. All I can say is, we are not faking it. My parents are very happy about our relationship."
