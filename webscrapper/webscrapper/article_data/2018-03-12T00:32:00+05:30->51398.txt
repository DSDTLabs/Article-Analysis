Bengaluru: The man who attempted to murder Lokayukta P Vishwanatha Shetty in his chambers last week threatened the latter’s official who rushed in hearing the former judge’s screams.

 “I heard screams within two-three minutes of Tejraj Sharma entering the chamber. I opened the door and found Sharma holding the Lokayukta from behind with a knife in his right hand. I could see the Lokayukta bleeding from his stomach. Sharma brandished his knife and told him not to go near him,” Lokayukta’s Dalayat K Palani said in the FIR.
 
 Palani, who was on duty at the Lokayukta’s chambers on March 7, was tasked with informing Justice Shetty about his visitors and allowing them to meet him.
 
 According to the FIR, Sharma came to meet the Lokayukta in his chamber around 1pm, and Palani handed over the slip mentioning Sharma’s name to Justice Shetty.
 
 After a few minutes, Shetty asked Palani to send Sharma inside. Shrama entered the chamber around 1.45pm holding some papers and within minutes Justice Shetty was heard screaming.
 
 “I called gunman Purushotham, Suresh and Dalayat Chidambaram. They rushed in; Suresh and Purushotham managed to hold Sharma and Chidambaram checked on the Lokayukta. I found injuries on the Lokayukta’s forehead, left palm, left portion of his stomach and chest,” he was quoted as saying in the FIR.
 
 Justice Shetty, meanwhile, is doing well and may be discharged in another 2-3 days, Mallya Hospital doctors said.
