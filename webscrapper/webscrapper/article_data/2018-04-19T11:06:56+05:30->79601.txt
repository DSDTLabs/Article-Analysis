LUDHIANA: To decongest city roads, police commissioner   has asked additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic)   to submit a report on solutions with the result of trials done. For this, some points — which witness heavy traffic and chaos — have been identified. Brar will submit the report by next week.

 Areas like Cheema Chowk, Samrala Chowk, Dugri Road, Jalandhar Bypass, Gill Road and old city face traffic jams during peak hours. Gill said, “Traffic chaos is definitely the biggest problem of the city, which has developed over the years. During my first meeting with officers, I have asked the ADCP (traffic) to make city roads less chaotic. I have asked him to pick a few roads and chowks, work on solutions to make traffic flow smoother, conduct trials, and submit report within 10 days.”
 
 Brar said, “I have already done trials at  . There, buses used to stop randomly to drop and pick passengers, causing traffic jams. Now we have installed traffic cones and specified stop area. We have also done trials on Dugri Road, which witnesses massive jam near the turn towards Model Town. There too, we have installed barricades. The result has been positive and commuters are thanking us. The traffic police, with the help of municipal corporation, is installing traffic signboards, especially of speed limit, on  .”
