PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation( ) has revised the deadline to start the   bus service on the Pune-Mumbai highway.

 It will now begin in the last week of April, municipal commissioner Dinesh Waghmare has said.
 
 The civic body had widened the 12km stretch of the Mumbai Pune-Mumbai highway from Dapodi to Nigdi to 10 lanes under the union government’s Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission(JNNURM) scheme and wanted to start the bus service in 2012. The highway has four concrete lanes for quicker travel with only a single stop at Nashik Phata Chowk. On either sides of the lanes, there are service roads with a dedicated bus lane.
 
 PCMC started to allow two-wheelers ply on the unused   lanes from Monday. 
 
 As many as 16 bus shelters built by a private contractor five years ago are in bad shape and need to be reconstructed. Reacting to it,   cell spokesperson Vijay Bhojane said, “Nearly 90% of the work of building 22 bus shelters is complete. Only installation of automatic doors, electrical units and Intelligient Traffic Management System(ITMS) remains.”
 
 Some barricades of dedicated BRT lanes have been damaged like the one near old PMC octroi post at Phugewadi. Bhojane said, “All the damaged barricades of BRT lanes will be repaired before the bus service is started.”
 
 Two-wheelers continue to face problems of four-wheelers parked near the merge-ins and outs obstructing their entry or exit from the BRTS lanes. Some bike riders have complained that they have to slow down considerably due to bollards erected at the entry and exit of each BRT lane. As a result, many two-wheelers prefer to use the central corridor instead of the lanes.
 
 He further said, “Bollards have been erected to prevent rickshaws, three-wheeler tempos, cars and other vehicles into BRT lanes. The speed limit on the highway is 40km per hour which two-wheelers and other vehicles must observe to prevent accidents.”
