 The lecture was organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the Indian high commission.
 
 Underlining that this was not the first time that China and India had border differences, Jaishankar said, "When such situations arise, I see no reason, when having handled so many situations in the past, we would not be able to handle it."
 
 China and India have been engaged in a stand-off in the Dokalam area near the   tri-junction for over three weeks after a Chinese Army's construction party attempted to build a road.
