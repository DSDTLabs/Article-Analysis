NAVI MUMBAI:   association has reiterated that they were willing to quit the business if   provided alternative plots for setting up business.

 The association president,   told TOI, "We are ready to quit if Cidco provided plots as we are project affected persons (PAPs). The central government has given the rights till 2026 as per MoEF for quarrying, and it was Cidco that divided the right of mining in two parts of 10 years each.''
 
 Cidco said the rules permitted grant of lease for 10 years which lapsed September, 2016 after which three months extensions were given twice till March 31, 2017. According to sources, Cidco has taken a strong stand about the state of quarrying and was cautiously moving ahead regarding the further extension of 10 years till 2026.
 
 Thakur said, "Cidco ought to take a balanced view as the quarry owners had paid over Rs 17 crore as net present value of the hills besides fulfilled other conditions too.'' 
 
 Meanwhile, the issue remains to be sorted with environmentalists and green bodies besides residents mounting pressure on stopping quarrying activities.   too has taken a view that it should have been consulted by Cidco before it gave the extensions.
