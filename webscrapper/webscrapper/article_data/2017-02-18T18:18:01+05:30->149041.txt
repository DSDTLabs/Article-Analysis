CHENNAI: Former   chief minister O Panneerselvam on Saturday said people will decide whether 
  in the assembly was valid or not. He said, “Dharma will win.” 

 Panneerselvam told mediapersons: “We had two demands: One, send the   legislators, who had been staying at resort in Koovathur, home for a week. Let them meet people and then vote. But that didn’t happen. Will people now welcome  ? We also wanted a secret ballot. But speaker didn't agree,” he said.
 
 Panneerselvam said 
  before voting. 
 
 He said, “People whom Amma (late chief minister J Jayalalithaaa) didn’t want are back in politics.” 
 
 OPS said he and his supporters would meet the governor if there was need for it.
 
 Former school education minister K Pandiarajan, who is in the OPS camp, said: “If there had been a secret ballot, MLAs would have voted against Eddapadi  . We may have lost the battle but the war has just begun.”
