PANAJI: Although the electricity department claims that its online payment system has improved, consumers continue to face problems while attempting to pay their bills. 

 With the due date approaching,   made multiple unsuccessful attempts to pay her bill online. For around a week the message ‘Your transaction is pending. Please check after sometime’ popped up each time she tried to log in. When she was finally able to complete her transaction, she was relieved that she had made it just in time to avoid the late charges. “My previous experience was worse. The amount was debited from my account, but the portal continued to state that I was unable to make the payment. It was only the next day that the paid status reflected on the website,” she told TOI.
 
 Another consumer who faced a similar problem has decided to revert to paying in cash. 
 
 Online payments are made on the department’s portal on its website https://www.goaelectricity.gov.in/. A consumer is required to enter his/her contract account number before proceeding to make the payment. However, though consumers are required to give both, their contact number and email address before registering and making payments online, they don’t receive any bill payment updates on either. 
 
 Another consumer suggests that the department provide a helpline number that one can use when they face difficulties during online bill payments.
