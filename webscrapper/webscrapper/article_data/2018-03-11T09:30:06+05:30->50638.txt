PUDUCHERRY: Chief minister V Narayanasamy on Saturday warned that the Union government will face the consequences if it delayed the constitution of the   (CMB) for sharing of the river water among three states –  , Tamil Nadu and Kerala – and the Union territory of Puducherry.

 Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Narayanasamy said the Supreme Court passed an order directing the Union government to constitute the CMB within six weeks for sharing water among the three states and the Union territory. “I, along with my cabinet colleagues, called on Prime Minister Narendra   when he visited Puducherry and submitted a memorandum urging him to direct for the constitution of the CMB at the earliest. However, we did not receive any response so far,” he said.
 
 The CM said the secretary (Union water resources ministry) convened a meeting on Friday to discuss the constitution of the CMB and sought the Puducherry chief secretary to attend the meeting. “Even though there is no scope for any discussion as the Supreme Court has set a deadline for the constitution of the CMB, we sent the chief secretary and secretary (water resources) for the meeting following the ministry’s request,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the   government convened an all-party meeting and passed a resolution to pressurise the Union government to implement the Supreme Court order and constitute the CMB to allot Puducherry’s share of water. The meet also resolved to urge the Union government to constitute the   water supervisory committee without any delay.
 
 He condemned Karnataka’s stance of seeking time for preparatory work on the constitution of the CMB when Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry have been urging for its immediate constitution. “Karnataka’s tactics of seeking time must be condemned,” he said.
 
 Narayanasamy said over 41 hectares of agricultural land in Karaikal, tail end of Cauvery delta, solely depend on the river water for irrigation for kuruvai cultivation.
