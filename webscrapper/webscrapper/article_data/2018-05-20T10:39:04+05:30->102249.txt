CHANDIGARH: Among various steps to commemorate 550th birth anniversary celebrations of the first Sikh guru, the Punjab government on Friday decided to rename roads linking various places in the state visited by first Sikh master as ‘Guru Nanak Marg’. 

 Chairing a meeting of the executive committee for finalising modalities for celebrations on a global scale, chief minister   also set up a high-level committee to coordinate with various organisations to build public support for the celebration. The function will be centered around the theme ‘Nanak Naam Chardikala, Tere Bhane Sarbat Da Bhala’ – the essence of Guru Nanak Dev’s ideology is of all pervasive love, harmony, peace, compassion, and amity.
 
 The committee would collaborate with eminent experts, historians, representatives of SGPC and the Sant Samaj. Its members include cultural affairs and tourism minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema.
 
 The chief minister would soon write to his counterparts in other states to urge them to undertake special development of infrastructure in places visited by Guru Nanak Dev and to make suitable arrangements to facilitate devotees visiting their states.
 
 The chief minister also said he would also exhort the ministry of external affairs to take up the issue of sprucing up of religious shrines associated with the first Sikh guru with authorities in various countries visited by the Guru Nanak Dev.
