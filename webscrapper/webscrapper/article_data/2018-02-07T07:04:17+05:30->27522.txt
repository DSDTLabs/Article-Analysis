LUCKNOW: After objection from UP police,   has been forced to delete a tweet about encounters in the state.

 Quoting a notice issued by the   to the UP government on Monday, the curator handling Amnesty’s twitter account posted — “Over 900 people have been killed in police encounters in Uttar Pradesh between March 2017 and January 2018. NHRC says UP police are ‘misusing their power in the light of an undeclared endorsement given by the higher ups’.”
 
 Since the   government took charge, the police have gone after criminals with encounters touching 1,000 mark in less than a year. So far, 37 criminals have been gunned down.
 
 When the social media cell of UP police noticed the   India’s post, it rebutted the claims. “Dear Amnesty, we beg our pardon but there’s a major human error in ur numbers, unless U have redefined D injured& dead alike! With due respect to the 37 dead V request you to respect the ones alive & not declare them dead! We’ll make sure our legal notice is better researched (sic),” it responded.
 
 The backlash forced Amnesty to pull down the incorrect tweet.
