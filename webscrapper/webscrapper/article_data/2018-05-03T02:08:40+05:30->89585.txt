NEW DELHI:   footage has emerged from a jewellery store in south Delhiâ€™s Neb Sarai that shows a man trying to steal items from the store by spraying   at the shopkeepers.

 The accused, posing as a customer, looked at several jewellery items before attacking the shopkeepers with pepper spray. The alert shopkeepers, however, managed to pin him down and alerted the cops who later arrested him.
 
 According to the police, a PCR call was received which stated that an unknown man had attacked shopkeepers of a jewellery store in Neb Sarai. A police team soon rushed to the spot and arrested the accused, identified as Sonu.
 
 The CCTV footage showed Sonu, with his face covered in a black mask, asking the two shopkeepers to show him more sets of gold jewellery. When the men looked elsewhere, Sonu pulled out a white bottle of pepper spray from his pocket and sprayed it at the face of the two men.
 
 Without wasting a moment, the shopkeepers retaliated and caught hold of the accused. Sonu is seen struggling to get out of the shop, but is unable to do so. By this time, other people from neighbouring shops gathered there and overpowered him. Cops reached the   with five minutes and nabbed Sonu from the spot.
