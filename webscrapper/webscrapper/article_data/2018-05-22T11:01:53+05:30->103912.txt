 ‘Raazi’ is the film that brought together Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal on the silver screen for the first time. Speaking about working with the actress, Vicky said, “She was really giving as an actor. She has the ability to lift any co-actor’s performance and that is the organic vibe she comes in with. That is really beautiful as a co-actor when you know that your performance is getting enhanced because of that. She is a fantastic human being too.”
 
 
  
 Set in the India of 1971 and over the backdrop of the period leading of India Pakistan war in the same year, the film covered all sensibilities of that era. Speaking about the same, filmmaker   had said, “Sensibilities are very different from what we know today. Even the patriotism as it is in the film is very different from what we know of patriotism today. And that is where the magic of cinema comes in where we all come together and create that world, pull you into it and convince you that now you are in this world too. All the departments of the film pull together to make that world a reality and that is exactly what shows in the film.”
