MYSURU/BENGALURU: While its new-found ally Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has joined hands with Janata Dal (Secular) in the May 12   polls,   has decided to go solo with a more aggressive attempt to find a national footprint.

 SP has fielded 31 candidates in the state assembly elections, five of whom belong to Yadav OBC category.
 
 Most come from prosperous business background in north and central Karnataka. The list also shows a thrust on Mysuru, from where   had obtained his bachelor’s degree in civil environmental engineering.
 
 Akhilesh is an alumnus of Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE), Mysuru.
 
 SP has fielded five candidates in assembly seats from Mysuru, including Narasimharaja candidate BM Nataraju, who is himself an engineer from a local college. Nataraju was a front-runner from the BJP until last month.
 
 In Karnataka, SP has largely kept its attack on BJP but it’s quiet on why it did not join hands with Janata Dal (Secular) like BSP even though SP patriarch   had served as defence minister in the HD Deve Gowda cabinet.
 
 SP is the only party to have fielded more than four candidates of Banjara category, who originally come from Rajasthan but are settled in Karnataka.
 
 This includes a Banjara candidate on the key seat of Harapanhalli from where BJP has fielded Karunakaran, one of the three Reddy brothers.
 
 “It was a long-time strategy to consolidate this vote bank to make a new dent in south before 2019 elections,” Rajeev Rai, SP’s Karnataka in charge told TOI.
 
 The key Yadav candidates include Shankar Yadav from Bidar, Satyanarayana Yadav from Gurmitkal in Yadgir, KS Saraswathi in Chitradurga and Dr DN Nagendraiah from Hiriyur in Chitradurga.
