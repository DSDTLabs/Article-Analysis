CHENNAI:   ( ) is planning to introduce separate entry/exit for international and domestic terminals as part of a new traffic pattern for cars in 20 days. A three-hour trial held on Monday between 2pm and 5pm showed that changes in signages inside the airport, and also on the GST road, were needed to prevent the cars driving in, from getting confused about the routes. The authority has called off the trial scheduled for Tuesday based on the feedback received. 

 A senior official of AAI said, "The trial helped us identify some drawbacks in signages on the campus and also on the GST road. There was some confusion as international passengers reached the domestic terminal. There was no problem for the domestic travellers who took the correct route to reach the first floor terminal. But travellers who drove into the airport from the Tambaram side of the GST Road had some issues."
 
 AAI will discuss with the highways department to have a U-turn near old airport building in  . "We will have to remove some of the signages installed inside the airport as they were not visible to motorists despite being huge. Some more signages will have to be installed on the GST road after talking to the highways department," he added. 
 
 He also said that there would not be any more trials. "We have understood the problems. The new system will be commissioned in 20 days." As per plan, the vehicles that come to domestic and international departures will enter the airport using two entries from GST road and will be routed via two new ramps that connect to the flyover in front of the terminals. Cars dropping off passengers at these two terminals will have separate exits, planned so they wouldn't have to cross the other terminal on their way out. It will also cut congestion as all vehicles queuing up to drive down the flyover need not take the same route.
