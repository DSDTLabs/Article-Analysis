HYDERABAD: They are the young victims of destiny. Over   below the age of 30 are either widows, deserted or separated in  .

 This is not the end of it. Another 5.38 lakh women between 30 and 50 years, and a whopping 11 lakh over 50 years are widows, as per the Samagra Kutumba Survey (2014). Conversely, it means men are dying young and officials now plan a survey to identify the reasons as well as schemes to make widows financially independent. There's a pension scheme of '1,000 month for widows, but the government is not sure of the missing numbers. Women's outfits hold the state responsible.
 
 “Liquor is killing men between 30 and 40 years.They start at 14-15 years and by the age of 30 or 40 they develop complications and die. We have toured villages and urban slums and found men just over 18 years killed in  ,“ said Progressive organisation for women national convenor  , adding that the state promotes liquor and then gives a paltry portion of excise revenue as widow and single women pensions.
 
 “I am not saying all cases of widows are linked to alcohol. But it is high time government looked into the issue of lives being lost due to alcohol,“ Sandhya said.
 
 Planning department special chief secretary B P Acharya said that a field level survey would be taken up to verify causes and formulate schemes.
