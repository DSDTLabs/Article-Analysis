Aamir Khan's Christmas release 'Dangal', which also stars Fatima Sana Sheikh, Sanya Malhotra, Sakshi Tanwar, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar, has taken the box-office by storm. While the sports drama, co-written and directed by Nitesh Tiwari, has collected an astounding Rs 295.14 crore at the domestic box-office, it has fetched a whopping Rs 154.81 crore in the overseas market. 

 
 
 The total worldwide collection (domestic+overseas) of 'Dangal' now stands at a monumental figure of around Rs 450 crore. The figure is not final as a number of screens in the international arena are yet to report their collections. 
 
 
 
 It is commendable how a film like 'Dangal' ' having a Haryanvi setting ' has struck a chord with the international audience and is doing extremely well in a market primarily known for formulaic Bollywood films. Come Friday, 'Dangal' will enter in its third week. What works in its favour is that there is no major Bollywood release hitting the screens this Friday. It is expected to bring in more moolah in the third weekend.
