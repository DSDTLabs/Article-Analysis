HYDERABAD: Runaway housemaids from states like   and Telangana who are pushed into the flesh trade in   are unable to use amnesty to extricate themselves, primarily because they are   to an unwritten bond.

 According to sources, they get trapped as they would have taken advance payments or loans from prostitution racketeers in Kuwait.
 
 When the women, who have gone there for   jobs, get desperate and run away from the house, they get trapped by agents on the prowl for victims. “A mafia operates there to trap such women,” said a human rights activist.
 
 
 Sources said housemaids are approached with an attractive offer to get them to leave their housemaid jobs and get drawn into flesh trade. Initially, they are also paid well and given advance.
 
 
 While housemaids from different countries are put up in flats and exploited, Kuwaiti sources said some also willingly get into the trade, lured by the promise of big bucks.
 
 
 “If the woman is interested in returning to India, she has to somehow make her way to the embassy so that she can be helped,” said migrants’ rights activist Bheem Reddy Mandha.
