Panaji: Heavy rainfall at isolated places during the last three days and moderate rain elsewhere has taken the seasonal total closer to 100-inch mark, as meteorologists recorded 2,448.8mm (96.4 inches) of rainfall on Wednesday morning.

 While the seasonal total should be 2,886.1mm (113.6 inches) at this stage, the deficit has shrunk to 15% on Wednesday, largely due to steady spells of rain since Sunday, after poor activity almost throughout the season.
 
 “The deficit is now 15% and it is within normal range,” India meteorological department (IMD) director M L Sahu said.
 
 As a precautionary measure, IMD has issued a warning of heavy rainfall for next 24 hours till Thursday but the rainfall activity is likely to diminish shortly. “Only light to moderate showers are likely in most places during the next two days fromThursday onwards and subsequently only in few places,” Sahu said.
 
 Fishermen have been warned not to venture out till Thursday due to squally conditions. The winds are blowing at a speed of 45 to 50 kmph, reaching 60 kmph in a gust or squall.
 
 “The sea will be rough with westerly to south-westerly waves,” Sahu said.
 
 During the last 24 hours, very heavy rainfall of 175.8mm (6.9 inches) was recorded in Pernem while heavy rainfall of 80.7mm was recorded in Valpoi. Other centres recorded moderate rainfall with Sakhali recording 57mm, Old Goa 46.5mm, Quepem 35.8mm, Ponda 34.8mm, Mapusa 33mm and other centres recorded lesser.
 
 The four-month   season ends on September 30.
