CHENNAI: While the   is planning to raise the minimum educational qualification for commercial vehicle drivers to Class X, government records show that graduates and those who completed Class X caused more road accidents than school dropouts.

 Nearly 40% of road accidents across the country in 2016 were caused by drivers who have studied till Class X or above. Those who   caused less than 18% of the accidents, according to Union road transport ministry data. In Tamil Nadu, the corresponding ratios were 46% and 10%.
 
 
 
 K Anbalagan, a cab driver in Chennai, said the educated, particularly college students, cause road accidents after driving under the influence of alcohol. “Many other road rule violations are done by this lot,” he said.
 
 “The school dropouts must have come up the hard way and have the experience to avoid accidents. Youngsters coming out of driving schools lack this practical experience. Most of them don’t understand even basic traffic signs,” he said.
 
 An academic expert advising government on policy decisions said that most young commercial drivers who take up driving as a full-time profession are educated and overcofident. “So, they seldom follow signs on accident-prone stretches. This behaviour changes once they are in their mid-40s. There have been cases where drivers miss warning signs on roads due to fatigue, poor vision or age. But this is minimal,” he said.
 
 Aswathy Dilip from Institute for Road Transportation and Development, Chennai said that besides education and enforcement, road design and engineering play a crucial role when it comes to road safety.
 
 A senior official from the state transport department pointed out that our textbooks now do not discuss road safety; from next year, there will be a separate chapter on these lines. “Only after this change is made, we may realise the impact education has on safety,” he said.
