If you fancy yourself to be a music aficionado, you have probably heard this very unique cover of the retro favourite ' ' by 26-year-old  , one of India’s first female professional bagpipers. It’s unique because rarely has the recreation of a Bollywood song been attempted in a bagpipe-dubstep vein. And inevitably, it has garnered huge appreciation for the artiste. “I played to 'Choli Ke Peeche' at IIT Kharagpur’s festival a couple of months back and the audience there loved it so much, that they requested for an encore! That’s when I thought I should make a video of it. It went perfectly with the current tide of recreating retro songs and also gave me an opportunity to explore mixing a very Indian fabric of sound with a rare (in India) instrument,” says Archy, whose one-woman band is called 'The Snake Charmer'.

 Archy started out as the vocalist of an amateur band and she confesses never having dreamt of anything else but standing in front of the mic crooning into it. “However, after our band broke up, I chanced upon this video by Eluveitie (Swiss folk-metal band), where this guy was playing a bagpipe. I was instantly fascinated. I don’t think I have ever been as obsessed with anything as I am with bagpipes. I went out of my way to learn how to play it. This, when I couldn’t find anybody to teach me in India, on top of the fact that I had never played a musical instrument ever before. Random mails to bagpipers abroad, online tutorials and a few music books later, here I am,” says the Delhiite.
 
 Some of her popular bagpipe covers are The ' ' theme, The ' ' theme, Ed Sheeran’s 'Shape Of You', The Chainsmoker’s 'Closer' and so on. She uploads her cover versions online regularly. 
 
 Charmer, we understand, but why 'Snake Charmer', we ask her. “I thought it would be interesting to pitch my Indian roots against a foreign instrument, which incidentally mimics the sound of Indian wind instruments like the been and shehnai!” she grins.
