MUMBAI: IL&FS Rail Limited, which operates   in Gurugram, is leading in the race to bag the operations and maintenance contract for monorail, which is likely to start services on the entire Wadala-Jacob Circle corridor in a month. 

 The contract of the present operator-L&T and Scomi Engineering-expired in 2013 and the   has been scouting for a replacement since then. MMRDA commissioner UPS Madan said, "IL&FS quoted Rs 2,000 crore while   has bid Rs 6,408 crore for a 10-year contract." A source said that MMRDA had estimated the operations' cost to be around Rs 1,000 crore.
 
 An official said, "We will study the bids and take a final call. We may even negotiate with bidders to reduce the cost. A final decision will be taken by MMRDA's executive committee."
 
 Earlier, MMRDA received a poor response as only IL&FS evinced interest and had to relax the conditions to attract bidders. MMRDA then floated a short tender notice on March 3. 
 
 Around 2 lakh commuters a day are expected to take use the monorail once the entire stretch is operational. The 8.8-km phase-I between Wadala and Chembur used to have a daily ridership of 15,000, till it was suspended, following a fire.
 
 Chief minister   had announced in last year's budget session that the monorail's entire stretch will be operational in December 2017, however, it has been delayed.
