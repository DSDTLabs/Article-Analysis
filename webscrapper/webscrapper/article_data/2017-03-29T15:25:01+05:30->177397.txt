Singer   has urged young   to ignore social media pressure. The 24-year-old star, who recently met a group of girls involved in an organisation that connects women from underprivileged areas with mentors who help them to realise their potential, said women have more worth than a comment on social media. 

  
  
 "It reminds me of why I do what I do. These girls inspire me every day. They give me strength in areas in my life I didn't know I needed,"   said when asked why she visited the girls. 
 
 "I just hope that they know they're worth more than an Instagram like, and they're worth more than a comment on any other social platform," she added. The advise comes shortly after Gomez admitted that her addiction to Instagram made her feel miserable, as she began to attach an unhealthy degree of importance to things she "didn't want to care about".
