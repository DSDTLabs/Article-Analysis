CHENNAI: All 200 wards under Greater Chennai   are supposed to be covered by   conservancy operations as per the civic body’s declaration under the   Urban project but residents in Kodambakkam, Teynampet, and Adyar zones — where Ramky Enviro Engineers is in charge — claim door-to-door operations are a fiction.

 
 This is despite the corporation earmarking more than Rs 300 crore in its last two budgets for private conservancy operations the three zones. The civic body says its door-to-door collection of   covers 100% of the city; it source segregates   in 40% of its wards, it maintains.
 
 Tansi Nagar residentM Balakrishnan said his locality is ready to segregate its waste. “We leave the garbage in two compactor bins that residents of at least eight streets and commercial establishments use,” he said. “But in this area, door-to-door collection is unheard of.” 
 
 V C Kannan, a resident of Kasturba Nagar, said it took a long time to convince people in the area to segregate waste. “But what’s the use when it all ends up in the dustbin? No one comes to collect waste from homes, though the bins on the roads are cleared. We plan to start our own   from June as the number of bins here is grossly insufficient,” he said.
 
 Ramky officials, however, said they have 1,550   dedicated for the three zones. “For apartments and individual houses, workers hit the streets at 7am, which is early so residents don’t cooperate. In highrise buildings, we have provided bins so residents can segregate waste, which our vehicles then clear,” an official said.
 
 A corporation official said all zones have door-to-door waste collection. “We have not received complaints from zones that Ramky covers,” he said.
