PUNE: The   has rejected the explanation of a Pune sessions court on summoning witnesses in an ongoing trial against a civic junior engineer charged with subjecting his 21-year-old wife to cruelty, dowry demand and murdering her in January 2014.

 Justice   of the high court had earlier called for a report from the trial court in Pune, explaining the status of the case and the hearing schedule in view of a second bail application moved by the accused,   Suhas Kshirsagar, on October 26 last year. 
 
 Justice Bhatkar had rejected Ajinkya’s first bail plea on July 20, 2015. The bench had then ordered that he might file a fresh bail application if the trial did not get over on or before November 30, 2015. 
 
 The trial court judge gave a report on December 1 last year, stating that the prosecution could not secure the presence of the witnesses. “This explanation is not satisfactory and is factually wrong,” Justice Bhatkar said in an order at the last hearing on February 15. 
 
 The bench pointed out that the investigating officer, who was present in the court, had made a specific statement that he never received any witness summons and therefore, the occasion to procure presence of the witness did not arise. “The reasons given by the district judge are not found good enough to accept the explanation,” the bench said and directed that the trial be expedited by April 24, 2017. “If the trial is not expedited on or before April 24, 2017, the applicant/accused (Ajinkya) is at liberty to move the application for bail,” the bench said, disposing of his second bail plea. 
 
 Sangvi police sub-inspector Vikram S Misal said on Friday, “Ajinkya has been in custody ever since his arrest on January 25, 2014. His parents and two relatives, who are co-accused in the case, were released on bail granted earlier by a court.”
