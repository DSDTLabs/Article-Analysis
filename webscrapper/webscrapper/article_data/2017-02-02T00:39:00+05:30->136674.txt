INDORE: Bicholi Mardana square in   area witnesses heavy flow of traffic almost all through the day as it connects to Bypass and Ring Road. Both heavy and light vehicles, whose numbers run into thousands daily, pass through this square as it is one of the entry and exit points into the city.

 The area is also densely populated as a number of colonies have been developed near the highway. The traffic problem at this busy square gets compounded when people from nearby rural areas also prefer to pass through it. The residents complain that drivers, especially those of heavy vehicles who cross this section, hardly adhere to permissible speed limits. And with a number of schools in the vicinity, such kind of reckless driving only increases the risk of accidents in the area.
 
 Those who commute through this square regularly say that during rains, visibility on the road drops significantly in the night as street lights hardly function. As such, cases of four-wheelers hitting other vehicles especially two-wheelers, go up.
 
 The movement of vehicles has also hampered by the ongoing construction of an overbridge in the area.
 
 Residents of the area say that there are hardly any traffic personnel posted in the area to keep check on speeding vehicles and errant drivers. They say that besides posting significant number of cops, the traffic department should also set up barricades to control speeding in the area.
 
 Traffic experts suggested that diverting traffic coming from city would help reduce number of accidents. “As road from the city opens directly onto the Bypass, the vehicles get stuck up in the heavy traffic flow on Bypass. Authorities should close down this direct opening and traffic should be diverted thorough an underpass near   area,” says Prafulla Joshi, traffic expert.
 
 “As the installation of speed breakers is not possible on the road, measures like putting up barricades and signage boards can help control increasing number of accidents,” he said.
