Be it Bollywood or Pollywood, a movie is incomplete without its songs. Last Friday, actor-singer   took social media to announce the release of a song from his upcoming movie 'Subedar Joginder Singhâ€™ titled ' '. 

 The song written by   and composed by Jassi Katyal a.k.a Jay K, has Gippy Grewal, Kulwinder Billa,   and   lending their voices to the track. 
 
 The song is picturized with soldiers at the front line getting letters from their loved ones. They are happy to hear from their families and at the same time miss being away from them. 
 
 This potpourri of emotions reminds us of the song 'Sandese Aate Hai', from an iconic film, 'Border'. The 1997 released movie was based on the battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Both 'Subedar Joginder Singh' and 'Border' share the tale of Indian fighters and the respective songs depict the true emotions of our men on the front line.
 
 Talking of 'Subedar Joginder Singh', the movie will release on April 6, 2018. It is based on a true story set during the 1962 Indo-China war, where Param Vir Chakra recipient Subedar Joginder Singh with a troop of 21 Sikh soldiers, fought against thousands of Chinese.
