Mapusa: Preparing a gram panchayat development plan (GPDP) was the main topic of discussion at the Friday Balcao held at Mapusa recently. A delegation comprising villagers and panch members of Candolim, Calangute, Assagao and Tivim were briefed about the GPDP by the Raia village development committee convener, Martin Rodrigues, and GOACAN convener, Roland Martins.  The panchayat raj ministry conceptualised a GPDP in February 2015, following the 14th Finance Commission’s recommendation to give Rs 2 lakh crore to gram panchayats between 2015 and 2020. The GPDP, which is an annual exercise for each panchayat, solicits the participation of villagers to decide where the money should be spent. Through it, the state government communicates the ‘resource envelope’ to all local bodies. At the end, every panchayat knows how much money it has under different schemes and how it should plan. Once a plan is formulated with contributions from villagers, the gram sabha passes it. Techniques adopted to collect data in the village were discussed at the meet.
