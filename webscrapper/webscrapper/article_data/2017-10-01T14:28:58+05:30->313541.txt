 and  's adopted son   has claimed that his estranged mother was emotionally and physically abusive towards her children. He detailed a number of alleged instances, where his popular actress mother would hit him.

  
  
  Moses made the shocking allegation in an interview, 'Woody Allen and the Art of Moviemaking'. The book is written by Allen's long-time author friend, Eric Lax. In the excerpt of the book, he also revealed that his mother apparently "coached" his sister Dylan to accuse their filmmaker father of sexual abuse.
 
  "Now that I no longer live in fear of her rejection, I am free to share how she cultivated and brainwashed me." In response to her son's allegation, Mia also issued a statement saying, "Moses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife who was pregnant when he left."
 
  The 'Rosemary's Baby' actress went on to say, "It's heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much." In 2014, Dylan Farrow, who is one of the Allen's three children with the actress, claimed that her father molested her as a child.
 
  Moses has always been a massive supporter of Allen in regards to sexual abuse allegations saying that his father would never do that. "Of course, Woody did not molest my sister. She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him," he said, in an interview.
 
  Allen, 81, and Farrow, 72, had a 12-year relationship which ended after he had an affair with Farrow's adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, who is 35 years younger than him.
 
  Allen and Previn got married in 1997.
