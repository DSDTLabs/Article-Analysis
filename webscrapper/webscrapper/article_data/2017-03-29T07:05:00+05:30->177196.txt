 Chandigarh: Chandigarh traffic police in association with social worker Arun Goyal, founder of Jai Smart Idea, have started a new initiative for removing the problem created by increasing number of vehicles in the city. 
 
 Goyal said that on a daily basis, police control room receives many calls for wrong parking due to which public as well as cops get disturbed.
 
 NGO members and Chandigarh traffic police appeal to vehicle owners to paste a sticker on their vehicles with their phone number written on it, so that whenever any vehicle is parked wrongly, people or cops may contact the owner to get it removed from the spot. 
 
 Members of the NGO also said that it is not mandatory for the vehicle owners to paste the sticker. Though, Arun Goyal and his team members have taken the responsibility to motivate people to paste the stickers on their two and four wheelers. Goyal further said that if the vehicle owner is a lady, then she can give mobile number of her husband/father/brother/anybody in the family.
 
 With this initiative, Chandigarh traffic police can call the vehicle owner and issue challan on the spot which will save time and expenses for the owners too.
