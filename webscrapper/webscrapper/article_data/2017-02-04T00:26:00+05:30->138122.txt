Mumbai: On Friday morning, when   MLA from Charkop   visited a party colleague’s home to pacify him as he was not given a ticket for the  , he was surprised to see a BMC junior officer there. “I was taken aback when the officer said he was there to ascertain and certify the candidate had a   and was using it. This inspection was being carried out in a flat in a tower,” Sagar said, adding that his colleague was only a probable candidate.

 Following an order of the state election commission that every candidate in civic elections must have a certificate from the local civic body that she/he had a toilet and is using it, the BMC directed officials to carry out inspection of the houses of probable candidates.
 
 Sagar said, "There would be at least 10,000 candidates (from all parties). Should BMC be wasting the time of its officials in carrying out such an inspection?" 
 
 SS Kabre, in charge of BMC elections, said late Thursday they modified the orders on certifying toilets. "We have asked candidates to submit an affidavit. We have asked the inspections to be stopped," he said. 
 
 A senior civic official said the first directive that came from the Election Commission stated candidates must have a personal toilet and this must be certified by the civic body. “Two days ago, the order was modified to either a personal toilet or access to a public toilet. In all elections, these are self-declaratory... There is no need for BMC to do any inspection,” said the source.
