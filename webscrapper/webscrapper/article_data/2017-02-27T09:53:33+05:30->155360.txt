NAGPUR: “Terrorism cannot be defined on the basis of religion, caste or creed. There are various types of terrorism and even an unlawful act intimidating a community can be termed as terrorism which thrives on fear among people. Therefore, we should destroy our fear to end terrorism,” said  , former director general of police (DGP) on Sunday. 

 Delivering a lecture on ‘International security and terrorism’ organized by Granthalay Bharti at Shriram Sabhagruha, Ram Nagar, to mark the death anniversary of Swatantryaveer Savarkar, Chakraborty said, “Terrorists do not fear law as they have lots of money. They try to create fear in society to their advantage.” He also blamed the media and intellectuals of the society for creating hero out of a terrorist. “If ultras are made heroes, then terrorism will spread in the country,” he said. “There are two types of terrorism — internal and external — both of which are dangerous to the country. Internal terrorists use guerrilla warfare to create unrest in the country,” he added.
 
 In his keynote address, former wing commander Ashok Mote said, “War and terrorism have no major difference as their motto is to conquer the country with all the means at their disposal. But terrorism is more dangerous as it acts within the country and create more unrest.” Explaining the terror scenario in the country, he said, “Pakistan is fomenting trouble as it is its policy to bleed India with thousand cuts.” 
 
 Present on the occasion were Babasaheb Deshpande, Vinod Lokre and Ravindra Pande. Ganpati Garkate presented a patriotic song. The event was anchored by Ashok Kaurzadkar.
