AHMEDABAD: Six bouncers have been deployed at first floor of   at Gujarat University (GU) tower office by the authorities ahead of   and   on March 25.

 The bouncers have been deployed second time at the GU as the authorities said that the decision has been taken to avoid any scuffle between members of BJP students wing ABVP and Congress’ wing NSUI. Earlier, bouncers from private security agency were deployed by a former vice-chancellor Adesh Pal for his own protection.
 
 Sources in GU said that members of NSUI on Monday filed their nominations for the senate and welfare body polls and the ABVP members may file their candidature on Tuesday. Considering past incidents of scuffle between the students’ wings of both the parties, the GU authorities decided to deploy bouncers despite having the security personnel of varsity itself.
 
 “Though the GU has its own security staff and it can also call police to get help in the time of scuffle, the authorities deployed the bouncers from private security agency. This reminds of a controversy when the former VC Adesh Pal deployed bouncers outside his cabin for his security to avoid scuffle with ABVP and NSUI members. After the deployment of bouncers, Pal had drawn criticism for using university resources to deploy private bouncers,” said sources.
 
 Interestingly, not a single leaders from ABVP or NSUI protested against the deployment of bouncers at the GU ahead of the polls whereas the same students wings had protested on wide scale when Pal had deployed bouncers for his protection.
