Ghaziabad: As the temperature soared to 44 degree Celsius on Monday, outages spanning hours were reported from Trans-Hindon residential townships.

 In the latter half of the day, several areas in Indirapuram, including Vaishali apart from Shakti Khand, Gyan Khand and Niti Khand, reeled under long power cuts. Blackouts were reported in some residential areas in Indirapuram when the last reports came in.
 
 The power discom, Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), attributed the outages to tripping of transformers and faults in feeder lines. A breakdown in the 132-kV Vaishali line was reported during the day. “We are undertaking rostering of power supply as an emergency measure. Our teams are rectifying faults round the clock. The new 400-kV substation in Kala Patthar is expected to be commissioned in a week following which supply will be normalised to a large extent,” discom chief engineer, SK Gupta, told TOI.
 
 Complaining about the power cuts, BK Pandey, a resident of Vaishali, said, “There were long outages during which we switched over to gensets. But the frequency of power cuts is now taking a toll on us.”
 
 Discom officials said electricity demand has soared over the past few days owing to the extreme hot weather with increased usage of multiple ACs, water coolers and refrigerators.
