MUMBAI:Two months after a leopard strayed in Mulund and injured six people, the forest department has paid compensation to all the victims.

 Honorary wildlife warden  , of NGO PAWs-Mumbai, told TOI: “I had recently met two of the victims,   and KrisammaPalle, who suffered the most of six victims. They said they were still awaiting compensation from forest officials and so I wrote to the forest department on their behalf.” Subramanian said the victims were handed over cheques of Rs 15,000 each.
 
 
  
 
 Casual labourer   (40), who had come face-to-face with the leopard, was mauled on the head and face. “After the leopard clawed and bit me on the cheek Iwas so petrified that I used to shut all windows in my hut at night,” said Kamite.
 
 Krisamma Hanumant Palle (40), who works as a maid in the vicinity, is still being treated after the five-year-old male leopard bit her on the forearm.
 
 “I had stepped out of my hut the leopard walked past me. I was shocked and the leopard probably sensed that from my body language. In a second, it attacked me,” she said. Deputy conservator of forests   told TOI: “Usually a proper procedure is followed. We paid the compensation to all victims after the honorary wildlife warden wrote to us.”
