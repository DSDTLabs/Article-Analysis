INDORE: One of the CDs, that were seized from the   flat above above  , had a PDF file with a speech by Talibani leader Shaykh Abu Yahya al-Libi. 

 The speech titled ‘Combat not compromise’ dated back to October 2006. It ran into pages and described the media link where the video of the 17 minutes and 41 second speech was posted. It addressed community members in Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya Palestine and Kashmir (which in the speech refers to as a separate country). He told minority community members to join the movement against those who were ungodly and non-believers. The   promised peace, prosperity, comfort and ease to those who went along the path of jihad. He asked all community men to wage war against acts of violence and cruelty perpetrated against them.
