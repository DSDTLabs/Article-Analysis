JODHPUR: The high court has directed the state government to form a special investigation team (SIT) to look into fraudulent motor vehicle accident insurance claims.

 Allowing a petition by seven  , the court pointed to the failure of the state government in taking any step to constitute SIT despite the   seeking an explanation in this regard following a spurt in fraudulent and fake motor accident claims.
 
 “Considering the aspect that the Government of Rajasthan has failed to take any plausible steps in this regard, the state government is directed to forthwith constitute a SIT headed by an officer not below the rank of additional director general of police for examining the matter,” read the court order.
 
 While passing the order, Justice Sandeep Mehta has asked the petitioners to file the requisite details of the alleged fraudulent claims before the ADG concerned not later than 15 days from the date of the order, and directed them to submit a detailed report before the court at the next hearing on May 24.
 
 Appearing on the behalf of petitioners, counsel   argued that such insurance frauds need to be curbed to set an example for touts who promote and initiate such fraudulent litigation.
 
 He said that wherever the SIT has been constituted to look into cases of vehicle accident claims, hundreds and thousands of such cases have been withdrawn.
 
 “In Chennai alone, false insurance claims worth Rs 81 crore have been withdrawn after the   ordered the constitution of SIT,” argued Kothari, citing examples of specific directions given to state governments to form SITs to examine and investigate bogus accident claims.
