AHMEDABAD: ‘Reva’, which means river  , is a thermal mannequin which senses cooling, heating and even impact of air velocity on body. She is sensitive to cloths, furniture and other objects and can represent various activity levels of humans, such as sleeping, seating, and standing. Now it has been acquired by city-based Cept university to work and conduct research in efficient air conditioning systems, low energy cooling systems and human thermal comfort.

 Centre for   at CEPT University has acquired the thermal mannequin to advance knowledge of human thermal comfort, clothing and physiology of humans. The mannequin was manufactured in Denmark and at present there are very few such mannequins across the globe. “It is a full scale model of a female human, representing thermal condition of human body under various indoor and outdoor environments,” said Rajan Raval, Executive Director at Centre for Advanced Research in Building Science and Energy ( ) in CEPT university.
 
 Raval said that it will be attached to a monitor and when wearing a garment, its responses will show the comfort level of the cloth in any given geographic region.
 
 When asked why it would be called   at CEPT, Raval said, “In Hindi, Reva refers to river, constantly flowing providing prosperity. We believe that ‘Reva’ will constantly help us generate new knowledge.”
