CHANDIGARH: With the notification of the UPSC to accept the maximum age limit for the appointment in the post of the director-principal in   and Hospital,   as 56, there is a lot of opposition within the college as the rules there are governed by the   and not UPSC. As per the   rules, the age of the retirement of a director is 60 years and there is no age limit for the post. This is eventually delaying the process of appointment of the director-principal 

 "There were representations sent by the senior faculty asking for a change in the recruitment rules. The same were forwarded by the UT health department to the UPSC. Recently, the UPSC has notified the maximum age for a director-principal's post as 56, instead of 59 years," said a senior administrative office in the UT health department. He said, "The same needs to be forwarded to the department of personnel and training." 
 
 However, since 1992 the college came under Punjab Service Rules, the post of director was to follow the state's rule which states that it should be filled by promotion and there is no age limit. "There was a court case where a nursing employee had moved the CAT recently. The court told the authorities to follow Punjab Service Rules for her promotion. So, how can now the selection be based on UPSC rules?" said a senior faculty at GMCH.
 
 After Dr   completed his tenure as the director-principal on April 23 last year, Dr AK Janmeja was given additional charge as the director-principal. Before he retired, the recruitment rules had been sent to the UPSC for revision.
 
 The GMCH had recommended for a maximum age limit of 54 years with tenure of five years instead of the present 55 years for tenure of three years. Also, the draft which was prepared in March had recommended that even after the director-principal completes his five-year term, he can be the head of the department until he turns 62 years old, the age of retirement.
