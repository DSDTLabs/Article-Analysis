AHMEDABAD: The   ( ) sealed a catering unit in Thakkarbapanagar on Thursday, after labourers were caught dumping food waste in the  . 

 The civic body also lodged an FIR against the owner of the unit, a rare instance in the city’s municipal history. Sections 268, 269, 270 and 431 of the IPC were invoked against Rakesh Patel, the owner of the catering unit at Parshawnath Township in Thakkarbapanagar. 
 
 The unit was allegedly dumping food waste in plastic bags in the canal and locals took pictures of this and shared them with the authorities. Action was taken within 24 hours, a senior official of the solid waste department said.
 
 The AMC has decided to install cameras all along the   canal to prevent illegal dumping. The decision was taken after officials realised even as they were cleaning the canal, unscrupulous elements were still dumping waste in it. The AMC has already launched a clean-up project for the 20km canal, under the Sujalam Sufalam programme.
 
 Officials are now surveying hotspots along the canal, where illegal industrial waste or sludge is dumped into it. The civic body is also talking to locals to gather intelligence. 
 
 “The cameras will help us nail the culprits, just as a photograph from an alert citizen helped us catch Patel,” said a senior AMC official. 
 
 AMC officials said chief minister Vijay Rupani had asked the body to take up a clean-up operation on the canal during a recent visit, assuring them help from the state government if required.
