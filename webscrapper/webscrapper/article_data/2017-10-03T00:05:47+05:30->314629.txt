BANTWAL: It was a sense of Déjà vu for district minister B Ramanath   as he launched the state wide Mathrpoorna scheme of department of women and child welfare at   anganwadi in his assembly constituency limits on Monday. Rai incidentally was a MLA when then PM Indira Gandhi initiated   (ICDS) in a phased manner aimed at addressing issue of malnutrition and resultant anemia among pregnant women.

 Describing Mathrpoorna as important 1000-day scheme of the Siddaramaiah government aimed at taking care of nutritional needs of pregnant women and lactating mothers at the anganwadis (see box) across the state and Dakshina Kannada, Rai recalled gesture shown by then union ministers   and   respectively in sanctioning anganwadis and mid-day meals to anganwadis in DK. ICDS was the precursor to Mathrpoorna scheme, he said.
 
 With regular medical examination of pregnant women too dovetailed in to the scheme, Rai said it has helped department of health and family welfare identify four anemic women and refer them to treatment at Lady Goschen Hospital in Mangaluru. “Access to nutritious and well balanced diet is right of every expectant mother and the subsequent governments have addressed the same through ICDS and now through its improvised version launched on the day,” he said.
 
 Exhorting anganwadi workers not to be deterred by criticisms that come their way with the launch of this scheme, Rai said this was the same case when government launched mid-day meal scheme, the anna bhagya scheme and recently the   scheme. “It is natural for any new scheme to have teething issues,” he said adding anganwadi volunteers and their assistants have major role to play in ensuring that needs of would-be mothers and new mothers are addressed.
