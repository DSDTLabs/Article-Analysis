Nagpur: City rural police under SP Shailesh Balkawade took a step ahead in adopting digitalization by distributing 275 laptops to officers and employees. The laptops originally priced for Rs 38,369 in market were made available for the policemen at a cheaper rate of Rs 32,900. With HDFC’s extending support, they can pay the amount in twelve instalments with zero per cent interest. This will fasten the legal procedures as policemen will not be dependant on the office computers which are not portable. Managing records and maintaining database will also become easy through this. E-Seva Abhilekh mobile application for employees was also launched on the occasion. The app, to be accessed by 2,200 policemen from the rural regions, will prove to be very beneficial, said SP Balkawade in a press conference held at his office on Thursday. The portal which includes different tabs will have a ‘rewards’ section where efforts of employees will be recognized. Through ‘E-Samadhan’ tab, the policemen can directly drop a message to the SP privately which will ensure that the information remains confidential. With the use of ‘E-Madat’ feature, employees stuck in problems in hinterlands can generate a signal which can be reviewed by SP and control room. The gradation list and information about police headquarters and other departments will be available on it. Online passport police verification and vehicle monitoring system are also set to smoothen the workflow. Nagpur Rural Police has also re-launched their website which can be accessed by citizens where they can seek information about legal procedures, special privileges to women, etc. It will help them understand which department to knock at time of grievances.
