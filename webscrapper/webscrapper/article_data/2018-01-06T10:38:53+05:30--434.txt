 The department has so far issued notices to 90 restaurants and sealed six of them in the past four days. 
 
 Chief fire officer   said, “We have asked all of them to install firefighting equipment immediately. Many of them don’t even put proper signage to show exit and entry gates. They don’t even have boards prohibiting smoking in their premises.” 
 
 SMC has become proactive and set up eight teams to cover the city after 14 people lost their lives in a fire accident in a restaurant in Mumbai. These teams pick up an area in a zone and randomly check fire preparedness of a hotel or a restaurant. The campaign for installation of fire safety equipment would continue for another week.
