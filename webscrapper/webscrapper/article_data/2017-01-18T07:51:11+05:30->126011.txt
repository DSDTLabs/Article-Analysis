BENGALURU: Although Karnataka health minister KR   on Monday assured private hospitals that dues worth Rs 150 crore­ reimbursement for treatment to below poverty line (BPL) patients under the   (SAST) scheme ­ would be cleared in a fortnight, private healthcare institutions have stopped free treatment to BPL patients from Monday.

 Federation of Healthcare Associations (FHA) and the   (PHANA) believe that these assurances are seldom honoured. “We have decided not to provide free treatment to patients under the SAST scheme till the government clears its dues. We will make exceptions for children and accident victims though,“ a FHA member said.
 
 The health department has not paid dues to the private hospitals for the past six months.
 
 Private hospitals argue that not only has the government not reimbursed them for the treatment that is offered to BPL card holders, the amount earmarked for the three schemes that come under the ambit of SAST, is woefully inadequate.“The amount of money being reimbursed to the private hospitals that offer free ­ transactions are cashless ­ treatment under the Vajpayee Arogya Shree scheme, Sanjeevani scheme, etc, is less than 50% of the cost we incur. The funds allocated by the government cover only 3050% of the cost,“ said Dr  , secretary of FHA.
 
 Admitting that hospitals, on social grounds, could not refuse treatment, Shanmuganadan said, “But it's impossible for private hospitals to continue to provide free treatment if the government is unwilling to increase funding for these schemes. We have requested the gover nment to revise the amount so that providing free treatment doesn't turn into an unviable option for us. Until then, we won't provide free treatment.“
