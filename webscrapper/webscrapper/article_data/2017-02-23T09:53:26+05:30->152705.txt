 Social media did make some valid comments.
 
 
  
  
 Some told him there is an easy way to stop the media from "blasting him".
 
 
  
  
 And some pulled no punches.
 
 Mallya fled to London early last year after the   (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation asked him to cooperate with investigations about his massive defaults on loans to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore.

 According to the ED, its investigation revealed that Mallya laundered more than Rs 3,500 crore of the loans on the pretext of payment of lease rentals, repairs, maintenance and so on.
