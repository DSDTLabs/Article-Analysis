We had earlier reported that Mohanlal's upcoming war drama,  , has   in two roles ' as Major Sahadevan and his son Mahadevan. The movie's director   tells us, 'Sahadevan will appear in two timelines ' as a Major and a retired 85-year-old Brigadier. His son Mahadevan, who is the hero of the Keerthichakra franchise, has now been promoted to the rank of Colonel in the current timeline.' The director though informs that the two characters will not be seen together in the movie.'

 While the team had shot most of Sahadevan's portions, which happen during the 1971 Indo-Pak war, in Rajasthan, they have filmed Mahadevan's portions in the Eurasian country, Georgia.
 
 'We shot part of a UN mission that Colonel Mahadevan would be leading. We have a lot of action sequences shot in Georgia as well but none of them will involve battle tanks as was in the case of Major Sahadevan. It was a short schedule,' says the director, who had wrapped up the shooting of the movie on Sunday. 
 The film, which also has Allu Sirish, Arunoday Singh and Asha Sharath, will have an all-India release, according to the director. 'We have almost confirmed the release in Tamil and Telugu. We are waiting for distributors in Hindi. The movie has a national subject and it's high time a Malayalam movie gets that much of an exposure,' says Major Ravi.
 
 The filmmaker adds that he's got Mohanlal to thank for the platform, especially with the superstar's previous few releases becoming box office success. 'His characters have a larger-than-life persona, and of late he's opening up new markets for Malayalam cinema as well as widening the canvas for filmmakers. Having him as the hero of a film 
 now opens up a different avenue for Malayalam directors,' says Major Ravi, adding that movie is expected to be an April release.
