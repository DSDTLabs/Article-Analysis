AHMEDABAD: Himanshu Pandya, who was the in-charge vice-chancellor of  , has been appointed the 17th full-time vice-chancellor of the varsity, with a three-year term. Before he was named in-charge VC, Pandya was dean of the faculty of science. Pandya will be among the youngest vice chancellors of Gujarat University.

 Tarun Das, registrar of   and Alok Chakrawal, head – commerce and business administration department of  , were the other candidates recommended by the search committee for the post.
 
 The decision was taken after the GU search committee held a high-level meeting in Delhi last week. Even Gujarat University’s in-charge registrar, Piyush Patel, was only informed at the last minute. Usually, after the name of the vice-chancellor is decided by the search committee, the university registrar informs the state government through a sealed letter. This time, a search committee member handed the letter to state government officials.
 
 This was being discussed in government circles and the decision was hence kept pending. Pandya’s appointment would otherwise have been announced last week.
 
 In the past, Pandya has served as the in-charge registrar of Gujarat University, apart from heading two departments in the faculty of science. He has authored two books and co-authored eight books and research publications. Pandya will now officially replace M N Patel, whose term as GU vice chancellor ended on February 20.
 
 “A students charter should be set up in the varsity to ensure speedy and time-bound administrative procedures. I will try to facilitate this during my tenure and make an effort to digitize processes and transactions at the university level,” said Pandya, about his plans.
