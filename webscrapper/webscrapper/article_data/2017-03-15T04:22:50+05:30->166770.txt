NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday introduced a bill in  , seeking to speed up the inter-state river water dispute resolution process by setting up a single permanent tribunal whose order will be final and binding on the states.

 Instead of having multiple tribunals under existing law, the bill makes a provision of a single permanent tribunal with multiple benches.
 
 The tribunal will have a fixed time period to resolve the dispute, unlike the existing ones.
 
 Once the proposed legislation is enacted, the   will subsume all the existing tribunals. The bill was introduced in the backdrop of lingering disputes over river water sharing among many states.
 
 The Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 2017, which was introduced by water resources minister   in the LS, also proposes to introduce a mechanism to resolve the water dispute amicably by negotiations through a ‘dispute resolution committee’ (DRC) before such disputes are referred to the tribunal.
 
 BJD member   said, “Since water is a state subject, I would also ask the government whether it has consulted all the 29 states before drafting it”. 
 
 Bharti, however, said the Centre was very much within its rights to introduce such a bill under Article 262 of the Constitution.
