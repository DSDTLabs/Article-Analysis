Chandigarh: The recommendation by the Election Commission of India to disqualify 20 legislators of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi for holding office of profit became a talking point for party leaders in Punjab as well.

 Aman Arora, co-president of the AAP’s Punjab unit said the move to disqualify his party’s legislators in Delhi was a clear case of political vendetta orchestrated by the BJP. Prime Minister   sees a potential national level political threat in AAP national convener  , he said.
 
 Incidentally, Punjab is the only state where the AAP managed to win four seats in the last   election in 2014.
 
 Meanwhile, Delhi MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa has welcomed the decision of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to recommend disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs for holding office of profit and urged the ECI to also disqualify chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who, he said was solely responsible for appointment of these MLAs to the office of profit.
 
 Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Sirsa, who is also the general secretary of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, said the ECI decision will lead to probity in public life and this decision should be hailed by all justice-loving people.
 
 Punjab leaders of the SAD were also quick to criticize AAP. SAD spokesman Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said it had been “conclusively proven” that the Delhi CM had gone against the law by appointing 21 legislators to the office of profit posts.
 
 “The Election Commission had justly held this move to be unconstitutional. AAP should accept this verdict gracefully,” he added.
