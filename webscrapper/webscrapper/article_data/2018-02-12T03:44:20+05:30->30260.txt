NAVI MUMBAI: A 17-year-old girl, who was   allegedly by a  , died on the way to hospital after giving birth at her home on Sunday morning. While the girl was declared brought dead at a  , police found the   inside a cupboard in her home.

 The girl’s parents—father is a security guard and mother housewife—told the police she could not go for abortion as she was over 20 weeks pregnant by the time they learnt about it. And they had hidden her pregnancy from inquisitive neighbours and friends saying she had a stomach infection. 
 
 A police officer said, “The private hospital informed us about the incident on Sunday afternoon as it’s a medico-legal case. When we inquired with the girl’s parents and her elder sister, they said she was impregnated by a college friend.”
 
 On Sunday night, police registered an FIR against a 17-year-old college mate of the girl under IPC section 376 (punishment for rape), 314 (death caused by act done with intent to cause miscarriage), 506 (criminal intimidation) read with the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. "After the accused, a minor, learnt about the girl’s death, he has absconded," a police officer said.
 
 Police are also suspecting foul play in the girl’s death. A police inspector said, “We are yet to verify claims of the girl’s parents. We suspect foul play as her family had kept the newborn’s body hidden. The bodies of the girl and the newborn have been sent for post-mortem at Panvel government hospital. The post-mortem report will reveal the actual cause of her death.”
