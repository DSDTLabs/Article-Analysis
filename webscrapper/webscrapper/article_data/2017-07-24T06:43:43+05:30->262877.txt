CHENNAI: The number of students from other states securing   seats from the government quota on the basis of nativity will go up from about 47 in 2016 to nearly 500 this year, if the state admits students on the basis of NEET. This would be a 11-fold increase in the 85% government quota seats in 22 state-run medical colleges and state quota seats in 10 self-financing medical colleges compared to 2016. 

 Data from the directorate of medical education shows that this year 58 candidates from  , 44 from   and 17 from   applied on the basis of nativity and qualified for MBBS admissions, besides 381 more students from other states. Last year, there were less than 50 students from outside TN.
 
 This year, the number of government quota seats went down to 3,377 from 3,609 in 2016, but the percentage of government seats for other state students might go up from 1.30% to 14%. 
 
 Baffled by these numbers, state health minister C Vijaya Baskar, higher education minister K P Anbalagan and four other ministers, who left for New Delhi on Sunday, will camp there to convince Union ministers and MPs that   should be exempted from NEET, at least for 2017.
