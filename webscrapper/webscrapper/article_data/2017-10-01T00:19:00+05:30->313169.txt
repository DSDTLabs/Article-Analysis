Trichy: Thai AirAsia’s Bangkok-Trichy-Bangkok service began on Friday night with the customary water salute accorded to the first flight which touched down at the international airport here with 58 passengers. Later, it took off with 181 passengers. 

 Flight FD 110 will depart for Trichy from Bangkok’s Don Mueang international airport at 9.35 pm local time on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and arrive at Trichy at 11.55 pm IST. Flight FD 111 will depart from here at 12.55 am on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday and reach Bangkok at 6 am local time. 
 
 With the addition of four services a week on the sector, the number of flights operated from Trichy has gone up from 100 a week to 104. The total number of overseas destinations connecting Trichy has risen to six after Colombo, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Dubai and Sharjah, connected by Srilankan Airlines, Air Asia, Scoot Air, Malindo Air and Air India Express. Thai AirAsia is a joint venture of Malaysia’s low-cost airline AirAsia and Thailand's Asia Aviation. 
 
 The flight has been widely welcomed by travelling groups from the state, particularly from the central region, as they have to take a circuitous route now via Kuala Lumpur, Colombo or Singapore to reach Bangkok. Hereafter, passengers can reach their destination in hardly four hours from Trichy. With a history of cultural and traditional links between the two countries and also being an affordable tourist destination, the launch of Thai AirAsia service is expected to attract more tourists to the region.
