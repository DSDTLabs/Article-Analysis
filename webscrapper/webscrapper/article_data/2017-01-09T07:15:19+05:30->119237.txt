AHMEDABAD: The drumroll of celebrity is heard hours before   taps his tablas. 

 On Saturday, Saptak Day 7, his popular renown throbbed even outside the venue. An autorickshaw driver said: “Woh ‘Wah Ustad’ wallah hai!” At the entrance, bouncers — all biceps and grimness, an uncommon Saptak sight — were demanding extra credentials. Then music began. Rahul Sharma, whom Hussain was accompanying, presented Kaushi Kanada. 
 
 The raga’s soft assuredness radiated the eminence of  , Sharma’s father. When the fanfare ends, Hussain takes his place in the Hindustani pantheon. His playing in the alaap was the light of an earthen lamp. In swifter passages, he produced shooting stars for santoor peals to fly.
