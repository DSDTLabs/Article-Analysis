Indore: City traffic police fined 32 people for speeding within city limits during a special drive against speed violators.

 Of the 32 violators, 27 were two-wheeler riders and five were four-wheeler drivers. They were caught moving at a speed of more than 40-km per hour during the surprise check. A penalty of Rs 3000 was imposed on the five motorists and Rs1000 on the two-wheeler riders. 
 
  The speed violators were seen irked over the traffic cops move as they claimed that they were not aware of speed restriction. “There was no prior announcement or speed limit sign on this road where I was fined for moving at a speed of 45-km per hour on my bike. Had there been any information provided on such imposition I would have moved accordingly,” said a motorcyclist, who was caught by the police near Pipliyahana square for speeding. 
 
 Traffic police officials, however, said that the restriction was not new to anyone. “Restriction on speed is already imposed in the city. While the maximum speed limit is 30km per hour on some accident-prone areas, it is 40km/hr in other areas including Agra Bombay Road,” said ASP (traffic) Pradeep Singh Chouhan. 
 
 The drive has been launched following complaints of rash and negligent driving along certain stretches. There were also incidents of speeding, especially during the evening hours. 
 
 Special teams armed with speed guns have been deployed along major stretches like Ring Road, MG Road, AB Road and Super Corridor. Also, other teams have been deployed along the busy thoroughfares in the city. 
 
 There are different speed restrictions for different roads in city. Traffic police has already put up maximum speed restriction of 20 km/hr, 30km/hr and 40 km/hr on roads with 60ft, 90ft and 120ft of widths respectively. “The speed has to be reduced near hospitals, schools and market areas for safety of commuters and those on the roads,” said officials.
