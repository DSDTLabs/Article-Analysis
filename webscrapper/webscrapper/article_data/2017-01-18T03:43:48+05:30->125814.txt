Gurgaon: To go or not to go to school is the dilemma many children and their   in the city will be faced with because of a communication gap between the education department and  .

 The district education office ( ) on Tuesday issued a directive to all government and private schools, asking them to suspend   on Wednesday and Thursday (January 18 and 19) in view of harsh  . But several schools, especially private ones, say they had not received the directive till late in the night. 
 
 The lack of coordination between the DEO and private schools has caused confusion, leaving children and their parents in a spot. Since many schools didn’t get the order, they did not declare a holiday. “We haven’t received any such directive. Even if we come to know of such a directive now, how do we convey this to parents?” asked Anita, principal of American Montessori School at DLF Phase-II. 
 
 DPS- principal Sushant Lok echoed Anita. “In case we receive the directive (by tonight), we will follow the instruction. But so far, no such mail has come to us,” she added.
 
 Managements of most schools claimed they were not averse to the idea of giving primary students special leave because of cold weather, but lack of coordination on part of DEO was creating confusion. “We normally abide by all such government directives. But due to lack of communication, we often fail to intimate our students in time,” said a teacher from Scottish International School.
 
 Amity World School at Sector 43 and Lancer International School at Sector 53 have received the order and will follow it.
 
 All calls to DEO Neelam Bhandhari went unanswered.
