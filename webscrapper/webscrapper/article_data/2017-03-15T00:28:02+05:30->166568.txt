AMBERNATH: The Shivaji Nagar police on Tuesday decided to probe the role of the road   and   civic officials in the case of death of a   in an accident caused by a pothole on the Forest Naka Road in Ambernath. 

 The order came after victim’s son Imran Shaikh and an activist Satyajeet Burman approached chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and senior Thane police officials by writing a letter. They demanded a probe into the role of road contractor and civic officials in the matter. 
 
 Last Tuesday around 9.30 pm, victim Sairabanu Shaikhwas riding pillion on a motorcycle while her son, Imran (26)was riding the bike. Near Forest Naka, Imran lost control of his motorcycle due to potholes and his mother fell off. Sairabanu suffered multiple injuries and died during treatment on Saturday. 
 
 When Imran approached police they refused to act and threatened “to book him in a false case if he speaks much”. They only filed an accidental death report.
