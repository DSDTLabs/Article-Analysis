PATNA: The midnight transfer of IAS and IPS officials on Friday led to verbal dual between the opposition and ruling NDA netas.

 Three opposition parties – RJD, Congress and HAM-S – alleged the transfers were done by the ruling NDA in view of the upcoming general elections.
 
 “Such massive administrative reshuffling clearly indicates that it has been done keeping in mind the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Since CM Nitish Kumar is not comfortable in the NDA, he has appointed officials of his own choice at the places of his choice. This is probably the last major administrative reshuffle before the Lok Sabha elections,” acting president of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) Kaukab Quadri said.
 
 RJD, on the other hand, accused the government of making frequent transfers of officials to mint money. “Corruption is rampant in this government and the transfers are also being done with the same motive,” chief spokesperson of RJD Shakti Singh Yadav said.
 
 Former CM and HAM-S chief Jitan Ram Manjhi too said the transfers have been done keeping elections in mind.
 
 The JD (U), however, refuted the charges. “Parties like RJD and Congress, which are completely soaked in corruption, should not level allegation of corruption against someone like Nitish, whose honesty and integrity is unquestionable. The transfers executed on Friday night were long pending,” JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.
