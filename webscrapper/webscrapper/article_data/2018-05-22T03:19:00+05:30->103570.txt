Ahmedabad: The special operation group (SOG) of the city crime branch on Monday arrested two persons — Junaid Memon (26) and Virat Raval (25) of Palanpur — with Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) in Rs 500 and Rs 100 denominations from near Astodia.

 Assistant commissioner of police, B C Solanki said that the police recovered 700 FICN of Rs 500 denomination and 1,300 FICN of Rs 100 denomination from the accused.
 
 “The accused have confessed that they had printed the notes on a printing machine at their house in Palanpur. The accused had also printed about two and half lakh FICN of Rs 2000 denomination but they had to destroy the notes due to mismatch of colour,” said Solanki.
 
 Police nabbed both the accused as they got down from a luxury bus coming from Palanpur. They were going from Astodia Gate towards Kankaria.
 
 “Both the accused are cloth pin traders and had suffered losses recently. They were to go to Vadodara and Surat from Ahmedabad,” said a senior police official.
