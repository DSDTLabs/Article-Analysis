Ludhiana: In order to expedite the reconstruction process on one side of  , deputy commissioner Pardeep Agrawal has asked the officials of railways and MC to coordinate and remove the encroachments on the land near the bridge. The DC held a review meeting with the officials of both departments on Monday evening where he has asked them to speed up work. He also pointed out the delay in work. The dismantling of the old bridge can start only when the encroachments will be removed. The MC officials, however, claimed they will be able to conduct the demolition drive next month.

 The reconstruction work of Jagraon Bridge has become a major issue in the city and since it is non-functional for more than two years now, the commuters get stuck in the traffic congestion on another side of the bridge because the traffic gets diverted from other bridges as well. The Gill Chowk flyover and Pratap Chowk flyover remain crowded most of the time because the burden from Jagraon Bridge has been diverted on these two flyovers.
 
 While reviewing the progress of the work, the DC has asked the officials to conduct a demolition drive as soon as possible so that the contractor, who has been assigned the contract, could start his job. Apart from this, the railway officials told the DC about the ‘satisfactory soil testing report’ of Jagraon Bridge and construction can take place at the site. The railway officials sought permission for the installation of submersible near the site as they will require water supply for the construction. The district administration has granted them the necessary permission. 
 
 The MC officials claimed they will be busy recovering the pending dues till March 31. They also said the new MC house has just been formed so, they would be able to do demolition work in the beginning of April.
