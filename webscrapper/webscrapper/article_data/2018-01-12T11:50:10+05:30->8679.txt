LUCKNOW: Organisation rebuilding has emerged as one crucial aspect of Congress’ future road map in UP. With a little more than a year left for the next   elections, the party is finally getting into campaign mode and in the first meeting of district presidents with   Raj   after his term was renewed earlier this month, party members stressed on the need to re-energise workers at the block level.

 “It has become imperative to reorganize workers and energise them to take forward the party’s message. As part of this exercise, it has also been decided to hold a three-day workers’ meeting at the block level. When and how this will be done shall be decided soon,” said a party worker.
 
 This, said party members, was crucial to take on the BJP which thrives on the strength of its karyakartas on ground. “For that matter, even SP’s strength lies in its workers. We not only have to match their energy but beat it,” said a source.
 
 Talking about the party’s recent performance in the local body elections, Babbar said there had been an improvement in the party’s performance though it did not reflect in the number of seats it won. “There have been some lapses but we are trying to identify those and I have asked all district and block level workers to send in their suggestions. Based on these, we will make a strategy for the party,” he said.
 
 The message that has gone out to party workers after Thursday’s meeting is that while they implement programmes, they also need to focus on local issues affecting their respective areas. “The state leadership will be chalking out a wider agenda of which all districts will be informed. Simultaneously, each district and booth will have to keep an eye on local issues,” said a party official.
