 The magistrate court had directed Kamal Haasan to appear before it on May 5 in connection with a complaint filed before it for his alleged derogatory remarks against Mahabharata during an interview to a television channel. V   of Palavoor filed the complaint last month.
 
 Seeking to quash the proceedings before the magistrate court and to dispense with personal appearance, Kamal alias Kamal Haasan alias Parthasarathy, 63, filed a petition before the high court bench. 
 
 The case came up for hearing before justice N Authinathan on Thursday. The actor’s side said that he was only responding to questions asked in the programme. The programmer asked the actor a question on the increasing violence on women. The actor answered that there was nothing surprising about the same in a country which reveres a book (Mahabharata) in which a woman was depicted as a collateral during gambling. Responding to a question would not attract provisions to prosecute the actor under Section 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person) of IPC.
 
 He did not utter the offending words in the presence of the complainant. The complainant downloaded the actor’s programme from internet and subsequently recorded it in CD, the actor’s side said.
 
 Following it, the court granted stay over the proceedings besides dispensed his personal appearance before it.
