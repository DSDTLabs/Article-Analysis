With Wrestlemania 33 fast approaching, WWE RAW went all out to boost their ratings and in a bid to do that there were appearances from Brock Lesnar and his advocate Pual Heyman, who cut yet another stellar promo on his client’s Universal title match against the champion Goldberg at Wrestlemania. The show, which emanated from Detroit, Michigan, also witnessed the surprise return of Mr Wrestlemania himself, the Heartbreak Kid,  , who interrupted the ‘Big Dog’ Roman Reigns’ call out to The Undertaker. Michaels tried to put some sense into Roman on facing the Deadman at the mega event, but to no avail. Reigns was later bulldozed hard on to the entrance ramp by Braun Strowman after that segment.

 Dana Brooke turned on Charlotte, much to the delight of the crowd and it definitely hints at Brooke getting a big push post Wrestlemania 33. The RAW Tag teams champions Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows once again interfered in the match between the team of Big Cass-Enzo Amore and Sheamus and Cesaro and the authority made a triple threat match between the teams for the RAW tag gold at Wrestlemania. In the cruiserweight division, The Greatest Man That Ever Lived, Austin Aries, made an impressive RAW debut against the Persian Lion Aria Divari while Chris Jericho and Sami Zayn triumphed over the team of Samoa Joe and Kevin Owen in an intense clash. 
 
 But the best part of the show was the final segment, incidentally the seeds of which were sowed at the top of the show. RAW general manager Mick Foley found himself at a very precarious predicament after RAW commissioner Stephanie McMahon asked Foley to fire one superstar from the RAW roster by the end of the show. 
 
 In the final segment, Foley pulled one out of the hat naming Stephanie as the superstar he chooses to fire. A stunned Stephanie gathered herself and lambasted Foley. Foley retaliated only to be interrupted by The King of Kings and COO of WWE, Triple-H. The Authority then went on to humiliate Foley and asked him to leave the ring. Foley reluctantly approached the ring apron before taking out ‘Mr Socko’ and attacked HHH. After Stephanie’s low blow, HHH unleashed on Foley and then the moment came when the crowd went berserk when Seth Rollins’ music hit.
 
 With the support of a crutch, Rollins hobbled towards the ring hinting he is still injured, but he let go of the crutches and went after HHH, dumping him out of the ring with a drop kick. HHH, however, had the last laugh as he used to crutch to reinjure Rollins’ knee and it took the referees running in from the locker room area to stop HHH’s assault.
