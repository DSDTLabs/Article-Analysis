NEW DELHI: The " " jibe made a comeback as Congress President   taunted the   government over a recent   report that labels   as one of the highest and most complex taxes in the world.

 
 "Modi ji, the terror of Gabbar Singh Tax is now globally acclaimed. The World Bank says itâ€™s the 2nd HIGHEST in the WORLD and one of the MOST complex," Rahul said in a tweet on Sunday.
 
  
  
 
 The Gandhi scion was referring to the World Bank's biannual India Development Update report which pegs the GST system among the most complex in the world, with not only one of the highest tax rates but also one of the largest number of tax slabs.
 
 "The tax rates in the Indian GST system are among the highest in the world. The highest GST rate in India, while only applying to a subset of goods and services traded, is 28 per cent, which is the second highest among a sample of 115 countries which have a GST (VAT) system and for which data is available," the World Bank said.
 
 What makes the Indian GST system even more complex is the number of different GST rates applicable on different categories of goods and services.
 
 India currently has four non-zero rates: 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent. Apart from that, several items are taxed at zero per cent while gold is taxed at 3 per cent. However, petroleum products, power and real estate have been kept outside the GST ambit.
 
 The Goods and Services Tax, which is the Modi government's flagship fiscal project, has been a favourite punching bag for Rahul since its implementation in July last year. He has frequently referred to it as "Gabbar Singh Tax", a monicker derived from his comparison of the government looting the poor of their hard-earned money with the help of this tax, much like Bollywood villain Gabbar Singh.
