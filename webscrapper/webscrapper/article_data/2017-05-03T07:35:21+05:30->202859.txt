 Two years ago, Wasim shifted from Karaya after his business took a downturn. After he moved to Howrah's Pilkhana and opened a cigarette shop, he realised it was not enough to sustain his family. The accused then decided to use his his bike for snatching gold chains.
 
 Joint CP (crime), Vishal Garg said, "Currently, there are four cases against him but we suspect there are a dozen unregistered cases against him"
 
  Wasim had been repeatedly snatching chains from women, including a woman police officer. The accused had coloured his bike's wheels in gold. Police suspect that a portion of it might be gold-plated.
 
 "While going through  , many times we saw a bulky man riding a white bike and striking his victims. After interrogating him at Lalbazar, we arrested a jeweller, Sameer Karan, from the Burtolla Garamhata Sonapatty area. We have solved four cases from March and April," said an investigating officer. 
 
 The accused have been taken to police custody for questioning till May 8. "When asked why he never returned to his Karya residence, where his mother lives, he told us that he did not want to be seen as a failure, who found it hard to make ends meet," said a police officer. 
 
 Cops said they are investigating the role of Karan, who has been buying gold from snatchers. "His links with other gangs are also being probed," claimed a source.
