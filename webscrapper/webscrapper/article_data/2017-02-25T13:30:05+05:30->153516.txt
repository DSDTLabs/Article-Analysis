MARGAO:   on Friday has demanded the immediate removal of the ‘derogatory’ image of ‘glamorous’ women advertising the ‘Manforce’ brand of contraceptives on the   that transport school students. 

 The Margao-based NGO, that fights for women’s rights, is opposing the fact that women have been “objectified” in the advertisement, which could be ‘misleading’’ to children. “I fail to see the need to advertise the photo of a ‘glamorous’ woman, along with a condom to be used by men and call it ‘Manforce’. This kind of advertising is derogatory to women,” Bailancho Ekvott convener   said.
