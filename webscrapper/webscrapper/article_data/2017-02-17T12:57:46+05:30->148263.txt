Actor   has said his wife,  , is worried their children might develop American accent.
 
  The English-born star, who shares 10-year-old Manon and Gulliver, nine, with McCrory, had adopted the American accent for his roles on " " and "Billions", and said that his wife now "has a horror" that he will transfer the intonation onto their children, reported Femalefirst.
  
  
 
  
  "I don't do it (the accent) in front of them. They once spent a school term in the US and they started copying the accent in this comical, exaggerated way, elongating their vowels. I put a stop to that. My wife has a horror that the children will start talking American if we spend too much time out there," he said.
  
  Though Lewis likes to keep up his accent when he is away from the cameras in order to make sure it is up to scratch, he said his friends back home often tease him for it.
  
  "I once did a US TV interview in my American accent and somehow it was seen by quite a few of my friends back in England.
  
  "There were several irate text messages. 'You are British! Stop talking like an American!' It has become second nature to me now and I am happy to do it. That said, if I am with Brits I come out of it pretty quickly," Lewis told Mr Porter magazine.
