PATNA: Two senior   functionaries from state – Shahnawaz Hussain and   – locked horns with each other over formation of the party’s government in Karnataka on Thursday.

 While Hussain, party’s national spokesman and former Bhagalpur MP, said B S Yeddyurappa was sworn in as Karnataka CM because the BJP was the single largest party in the state,   MP Sinha said   and JD (S) should have been allowed to form government as their MLAs commanded numerical majority.
 
 “The JD (S) had campaigned against the Congress, but chose to join hands with it after the declaration of results just to keep BJP away. The BJP will prove its majority on the floor of the House and not on the streets. It is for the first time in the country that someone invited by the governor to form government has been obstructed on his way to the Raj Bhavan,” Hussain said.
 
 Meanwhile, in a series of tweets, Sinha questioned the party’s decision to form the government in Karnataka. “Hope, wish and pray that good sense, maturity and wisdom prevails. In the present situation, one really wishes that justice prevails,” Sinha tweeted, adding, “What is right for Meghalaya, Manipur and Goa should be right for Karnataka too. God save Karnataka and democracy. Jai Hind.”
 
 Sinha was unrelenting in his attack on the BJP’s decision to form government in Karnataka, suggesting that things other than “wisdom” were being applied. “The politics of jugaad and arm-twisting or for that matter dhanshakti over janshakti is neither acceptable nor desirable,” Sinha tweeted.
