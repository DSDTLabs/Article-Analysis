UDAIPUR: Around 10,000   held in   at 16 centers on Sunday. Students went through the rigorous frisking procedure, passed through metal detectors before they were admitted into the main examination hall at every centre. “We had two slots for students A and B so that the frisking could be carried out smoothly. In the A slot, students were asked to report between 7.30 am and 8.30 am while for the B slot reporting time had been fixed between 8.30 am and 9.30 am to avoid any commotion or last minute rush,” said George Thomas, the city coordinator of the exam. Students were to carry only admit cards and a passport size photograph with them, they were provided pens at their respective centers after authenticating their identities. At some centers students who had worn shoes, were asked to take them off and so, a few of them were seen walking barefoot inside the examination hall. “At every centre we had arranged even photographers for those students who had forgotten to carry their passport size pictures. We had ensured that no genuine student had to return without taking the exam for the reason of non-completion of formalities. Those who forgot their admit cards too were provided with a duplicate one downloaded at the center itself,” Thomas informed. Flying squad including CBSE officials visited all the centers to ensure the smooth conduction of the exam, no cheating cases or other complaints were received from anywhere.
