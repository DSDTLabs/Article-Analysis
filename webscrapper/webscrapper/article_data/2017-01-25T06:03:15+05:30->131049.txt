HYDERABAD: After being flooded with messages about the Ethics & Human Values and   which are scheduled for Saturday and Monday respectively, the parents of Intermediate students are a worried lot as to why they are being sent these messages about a simple exam. “In the past few days, I have received some 20 messages from my son's college saying that attendance for these exams is compulsory and if he fails to attend, he would be marked not qualified in the board exam,“ said A Srinivas Rao, a parent.

 “I don't understand why they have to remind us about exams so many times," he added.
 
 Officials of the intermediate board sent out a message asking principals of junior colleges to give wide publicity among students regarding the exams following a recent   guideline on the importance of such exams. The board also asked students who have backlogs to appear for these exams on their old hall ticket numbers from their respective colleges.
 
 “In the past few years, we have noticed students not being serious about these exams, because of which even bright students were marked unqualified as they skipped the test. To make sure that all the students clear the exam, we are asking colleges to be extra cautious about Ethics and Environmental education examination,“ said P S Harindranath, a district intermediate education officer. BIE has introduced Envi ronmental Education subject in the year 2006 and the Ethics & Human Values subject in the year 2014 to the intermediate first-year students. These exams are compulsory to get intermediate pass certificate.
