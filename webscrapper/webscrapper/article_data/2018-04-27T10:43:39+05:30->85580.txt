The Madras high court direction to the CBI to probe the multi-score gutka scam has come as a blow to the   regime, but the government tried to put up a brave front. Senior minister   rejected demands of the opposition seeking resignation of health minister  , director general of police T K Rajendran and others, stating that “the investigation is in a preliminary stage”.

 “This cannot be a setback. These are mere charges and only an inquiry will reveal the truth,” Jayakumar said.
 
 DGP Rajendran called on the chief minister and chief secretary   in their chambers.
 
 Party sources said the government would seek legal opinion on whether to move an appeal or not and a clear picture will emerge on Friday. Vijayabaskar said it was common for the opposition to level slanderous allegations against those in public life, especially those who are efficient.
 
 “It is the job of opposition to defame. I can only say that I have nothing to fear,” he said. Senior leader C Ponniayan denied any setback to the government.
 
 The DVAC which filed FIR against 17 people in September, including mid-level government officials, gutka manufacturer  , left out the names of health minister and senior police officers, who figured in the report submitted by the I-T department to the government.
 
 “The agency was to file FIR against health minister and police officials, and the then vigilance commissioner, V K   was removed amid much pressure. The questionnaires were sent to former chief secretary P Rama Mohana Rao, former DGP Ashok Kumar and I-T principal director (investigation) B R Balakrishnan and replies received,” a source said.
 
 Jeyakodi was replaced by senior bureaucrat, Mohan Pyare who was commissioner of Indian Medicine and Homeopathy for three years, the department that comes under none other than health minister Vijayabaskar.
