VIJAYAWADA: The state government's administrative   of 9.03 crore toward compensation for horticultural crops damaged due to drought during   in 2015 has defeated the purpose of input subsidy to farmers. The order issued on Thursday comes after two years of delay. Farmers are gearing up for kharif operations this year in three weeks. 

 The purpose of input subsidy is to provide relief to farmers who have lost their crops due to drought or floods or any other reason by releasing subsidy on the expenditure incurred during the immediate agricultural season. More than 200 mandals in seven districts of   were hit by drought during Kharif in 2015, triggering migrations and suicides. Along with paddy, cotton, chillies, onion and other cash crops, horticulture crops such as mango and acid lime were also affected.
 
 "The government seems to have woken up from a long slumber and released funds for crops damaged in 2015. It is not showing interest in handing out assistance to farmers, but is all too willing to release funds to clear the bills of contractors. This shows the government's priorities," said  , former member of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.
 
 While the Centre releases 50% of the funds, the state government is required to release the remaining. The Union government had released drought relief funds in 2016 itself. Sources in the horticulture department said that the state government had failed to release its share and hence the input subsidy was put on hold. "As the state has to utilise its finances judiciously, it used the available funds according to its priorities. Hence, there was a delay of almost two years," admitted a top official.
