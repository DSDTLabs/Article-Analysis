MADURAI: The corporation while executing storm   project would have expected them to be mere drains letting   out of the city. But by concreting the floor, it has inadvertently caused an adverse effect of preventing the drain water from seeping into the ground and enriching the ground water table in the city areas. 

 After indiscriminate urbanisation turned the agricultural channels into sewage carriers, the sewage in itself was indirectly boosting ground water level through percolation. For instance, a lot of residents in Anupanadi even used this sewage water to irrigate their agricultural fields. 
 
 “Forget about irrigation, the ground water level itself declined to 300 feet from 50 feet after Anupanadi and Kiruthamal channels flowing in the region were constructed using concrete”, said M Muthuraja, a resident of Anupanadi. 
 
 A Marisamy, a resident of Madakulam, complained at the recent farmers’ grievance redressal meeting that the city corporation had spoiled their outlet channel from  . By concreting the channel, the nearby areas are deprived of ground water. “The concrete floor should be broken to allow seepage”, he said. 
 
 Corporation officials however stated that rain water harvesting system has been fixed at a particular gap in the channel allowing the drain water to percolate. Unfortunately, such small provision for seepage has not served its purpose and the rain water harvesting provision in most of the channels have become defunct long ago.
