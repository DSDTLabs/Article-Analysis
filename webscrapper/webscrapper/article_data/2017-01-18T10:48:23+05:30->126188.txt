COIMBATORE:   of the Chadivayal   camp in Coimbatore lost its tusk after a wild elephant attacked it in the early in the early hours of Wednesday. 

 Forest department officials said a wild elephant that had been roaming around the camp for the past one week entered the camp and got into a fight with Sujay, a 46-year-old kumki. They said the wild elephant was in musth.
 
 Around 4am, loud noises were heard, and forest officials, elephant handlers and locals around the camp gathered to drive the wild elephant away.
 
 “Their tusks were locked and the wild elephant was bigger in size. It injured Sujay and broke its right tusk,” said S Ramasubramanian, district forest officer. He added that crackers were used to drive the wild elephant away.
 
 Dr Manoharan Sadiyappan, the veterinarian of the forest department treating Sujay, said the elephant was out of danger. “There has been a lot of blood loss and the socket area where the tusk is attached to the trunk has been injured. We are treating it. Sujay has slowly started consuming green fodder as well. We hope it recovered soon,” said Manoharan.
 
 Sujay was brought to Chadivayal camp from the Theppakadu elephant camp in May 2015. It was one of the twins, and its twin brother’s name is Vijay. Sujay has been part of several operations including the operation ‘Madukkarai Maharaj’.
 
 Manoharan said Sujay was extremely disciplined and obedient. Despite being smaller in size, Sujay was strong and powerful.
 
 The forest department plans to give Sujay rest. It will not be taking part in any operations in future after this injury. “Tusks are very important in operations. So we will give Sujay rest and hope he will recover soon,” said Ramasubramanian.
