Pune: The local bench of the MahaRERA conciliation forum has amicably resolved 12 cases favouring the home buyers’ interest since its formation under the Real Estate Regulation and Development Act, 2016.  Five conciliation benches of MahaRERA became operational at its Aundh facility and Credai’s Pune office in the Camp area from February 1 and started hearing cases from March 10.  Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) Pune-Metro president Shrikant Paranjape said amicable settlement was an achievement in itself towards a speedy resolution of disputes . “This will continue to create confidence among the home buyers,” he added. The MahaRERA conciliation forum was established under section 32(g) of RERA to amicably resolve between home buyers, allottees or customers and developers registered with the authority. The resolution avoids legal and other expenses, while engagement of a lawyer costs a customer only Rs 1,000. Further, it ensures immediate and early relief to customers through one-on-one interaction with the conciliators. As per the rules, a home buyer or an allottee has to raise a complaint on MahaREREA’s official website. The grievance is then sent to the developer for confirmation whether to proceed with the conciliation process. On receipt of confirmation, the complainant pays Rs 1,000 as fees. MahaRERA then appoints the conciliators to resolve the dispute within a period of 45 days. The conciliation panel has been formed as part of an alternate dispute redressal for disputes under RERA that allows the authority to have conciliators. Of the 33 members under MahaRERA conciliation forum, 11 are for the five benches in Pune.  The conciliators appointed for Pune city are Tanuja Rahane, Kalpita Ranade, Shirish Mulekar. Sanjeev Kulkarni and Keshav Barve from the Mumbai Grahak Panchayat’s Pune Division. Rohit Gera, Anil Pharande, Manish Jain, Amar Manjrekar and I P Inamdar were appointed from Credai-Pune Metro.
