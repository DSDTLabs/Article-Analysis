BHOPAL: For five years, the railways fought a case in court where an   allegedly refused to accept the court summons — only to find out this month that they were dead before the suit was even filed.

 The case pertains to a compensation dispute.  , a resident of Ujjain, died after falling from a train in 2002. The railways gave a compensation of Rs 4 lakh to his wife, Rukmani. But in 2008, Ram Chandra’s parents Nandram and   got an additional Rs 2 lakh. However, the rules say that only Rs 4 lakh compensation can be claimed by the kin of deceased.
 
 Railways filed a petition for recovery of the additional compensation. Calling the parents’ claim illegal, the railways filed a case on August 22, 2012 against them and their lawyer. But the summons sent through registered post was returned with a note that the addressed persons “have refused to take the summons”.
 
 A lower court in its judgment in 2012 maintained that the railways had crossed the time limit for making a recovery claim. “Later, railways again filed an appeal in the court of additional district judge   in Bhopal,” said counsel for the lawyer of the deceased couple, advocate Ehtesham Qureshi.
 
 But the return of the summons was perplexing until it emerged that Kaveri Bai had died in 2007 and Nandram died in July 2008, two months before railways filed the case. “On March 3, the court disposed of the railways petition, saying there is no question of recovery from the deceased as they died before institution of the case. In case of the other respondent (lawyer), no proof has been found to establish that he is entitled for recovery,” Qureshi told TOI.
 
 The court in its judgment said, “No rational reason has been found as to why lawyer   was made a respondent by the railways in its petition for recovery of compensation”. TOI has a copy of the judgment.
