MUMBAI: In a fairly speedy decision that came in six months, on Tuesday, the   (RCT) in Mumbai granted   to 36   of the Elphinstone Road   tragedy on September 29, 2017. 

 A total of 39 applications were made a month after the tragedy. Of the 36 granted compensation, 17 were   of those who had died in the stampede. They were awarded Rs 8 lakh each. For 19 injured victims, the tribunal awarded compensation ranging from Rs 25,000 to even Rs 8 lakh in cases of total disability. Compensation depends on gravity of injury; for serious injuries, the payout is Rs 4 lakh to Rs 7 lakh.
 
 “Total disability is treated on par with loss of life,” K P Yadav, registrar of Railway Claims Tribunal’s principal bench in Delhi and administrative head of RCT in Mumbai, told TOI.
 
 The tribunal had issued forms which victims and their families had filled and submitted. No lawyers were involved in the adjudicatory process. On receiving the claims pleas, the tribunal had issued a notice to the railway authorities in October itself for response. But the reply came forth last week. The railways did not wish to contest the claims cases though.
 
 The tribunal passed the final orders within a week, on Tuesday. For three applicants, lack of complete documents meant their orders were deferred. A decision will be taken as soon as they submit the papers.
 
 “The speedy compensation by RCT is a great step to ameliorate the suffering of these innocent victims,’’ said BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, who pursued the compensation demand.
 
 Ghatkopar resident Nilesh Dedhia, father of 24-year-old Hiloni who lost her life, said, “The tribunal has approved the grant of compensation to us, but it could take a month or two before payment is processed.” Unhappy with Rs 25,000 awardede to him, Ritesh Rathod, one of the injured, said he had spent more on his treatment.
