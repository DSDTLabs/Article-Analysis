BHOPAL:   (TCS) had approached MP Professional Board aka   to hold examinations for the board a few years ago, but financial crunch forced the organization from going ahead with the proposal.

 Disclosing this while addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, the global head of TCS iON, V Ramaswamy, said, “Vyapam scam was unfortunate. In the aftermath of the scam, we did share some of the best practices (of digital solution) that we use with the government and the details of what we do and how we do.”
 
 He was in Bhopal to review a zonal meeting. When asked why the TCS was not able to hold exams for Vyapam, he said price could be the reason. “We are the premium service provider. We don’t cut cost when we take exams because exams are very sensitive topics and we put right infrastructure in place. We need to invest in research and development to see how malpractices happen. If you want to hold a fair and free assessment there is a cost associated with it,” he said.
 
 Exam board director   told TOI, “In 2015, the TCS did participate in tenders for holding exams, but it did not get the contract because of high cost quoted by the company.” To a pointed query, Ramaswamy said at the moment Bihar and UP are worst placed as far as exams are concerned, but there is as big push in holding digital exams in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 The TCS is holding exams for the state’s women and child welfare department, Madhya Pradesh High Court, electricity board and Jal Nigam. Interestingly, the TCS also did a pilot project with the   for digital assessment of its board exams.
 
 “Cost constraints again was supposedly the reason why the government did not go ahead with the project,” said Ramaswamy. He said the TCS has set up its exam centres in all the districts of Madhya Pradesh except Agar. Ove 62 lakh candidates across the state have been assessed through the digital assessment solutions, he said.
