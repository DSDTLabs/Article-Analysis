 The  , meanwhile, said it had detected diversion of funds that ought to be used for building flats in its audit of 24 developers who, between them, account for nearly 36,000 new housing units. Its chief Alok Tandon said, "We have found some developers have diverted funds meant for constructing flats for homebuyers. The details will be disclosed on Saturday (Feb 9). We will serve notices to them."
 
 Friday's police complaints were filed after a field inspection, which was ordered earlier this week by district magistrate BN Singh because the state government was losing crores in revenue.
 
 Deputy inspector-general (stamps and registration) GP Singh said the complaints were against 10 builders in Noida and five in Greater Noida. "This was done after our team surveyed builder projects in their areas and checked whether homebuyers are living in flats where registration of property has not been done," he said, adding photographs had been taken as evidence.
 
 Realtors in the two cities have been under tremendous pressure from homebuyers to hand over flats.
