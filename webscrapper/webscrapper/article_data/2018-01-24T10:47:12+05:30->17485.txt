BHOPAL: Residents of a posh colony in   are on the tenterhooks after their CCTV cameras captured ominous footage of masked men prowling the township as if they were making a recce. Police, however, refused to take the residents seriously and didn't accept a complaint, they say.

 The men looked like they belong to the notorious 'chaddi baniyan' gang, said a resident of Indus Empire Colony, adding that it appeared as if they were checking out which houses to hit. They broke into at least one house and committed theft, said another resident. 
 
 CCTV surveillance clicked at least six men, masks tied around their faces. The movement of the 'gang' was caught on CCTV cameras in four houses.
