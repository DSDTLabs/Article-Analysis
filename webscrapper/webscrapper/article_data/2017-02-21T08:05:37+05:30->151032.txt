HYDERABAD: Raising an alarm over increase in cases involving mothers killing their infants, in the recent past,   here on Monday demanded the government strictly implement the ' ' programme, so as to avoid such incidents in the future. 

 The 'Ooyala' programme was launched across India in 2004 by the central government. According to it, all state governments were expected to make a cradle facility available in every Anganwadi centre, government hospital, shishugruha and shishu vihar centre so that mothers who want to disown their babies can leave him/her in the cradle. Despite the lapse of over a decade the facility, activists allege, has not been set up at most centres. 
 
 "It is a very alarming situation. Innocent infants are losing their basic right to live and no civilised person or society will accept this inhumanity. Bogged down by poor social, economical health conditions, mothers are killing their own babies. Poverty is the primary reason for this," said   of   (BHS). He was speaking at the poster release of an awareness campaign on the issue of infanticide being conducted by   (APSA).
 
 Over the past three months, about 18 children were reportedly killed by their mothers in and around Hyderabad city. According to child rights activists, the situation is even worse in the villages.
 
 "When a mother is unable to raise a kid and want to handover the baby over to someone else, Anganwadi workers are supposed to take the baby without asking for identification. However, those people don't know that such a programme exists. Even government hospitals have no no clue about it as these posters are missing from their walls," Rao said.
