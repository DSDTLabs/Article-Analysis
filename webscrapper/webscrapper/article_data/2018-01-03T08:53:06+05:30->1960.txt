INDORE: The BCCI is likely to do away with any domestic fixture on new year’s eve and new year’s day from next season. 

 “The future tours and programmes committee will have to revisit this schedule. There shouldn’t be matches on these two days from the next season,” BCCI acting president CK Khanna told TOI on Tuesday. “The domestic players stay away from the families for much of the season. They need to be with their dear ones on such special days,” Khanna added.
 
 
 
 This has been a rare season in which an entire   has played out without any complaint about the pitches. While the board has already reinstated the zone-based 'best pitch award' from this year, the board had actually deployed neutral curators for every match. The pitch award carries an amount of Rs 10 lakhs. “This is the reason why we thought of bringing in neutral curators. The curators deserve credit and it will be seen that they are duly rewarded,” Khanna said.
 
 
 
 MUMBAI: 2018 seems to have brought a bag of goodies for the Vidarbha players. With the IPL auction scheduled to take place on January 27 & 28 in Bangalore, the Nagpur-based team seems to have clinched its maiden Ranji Trophy title at an ideal time.
 
 An indication that the likes of Rajneesh Gurbani, the pacer who picked up a hat-trick in the Ranji final, besides returning a five-wicket haul in all the knockout games for Vidarbha, could be hot picks in the auction, came when TOI learnt that within 24 hours of clinching the crown in Indore, Gurbani, Aditya Sarwate and Aditya Thakare appeared for the trials of the Mumbai Indians.
