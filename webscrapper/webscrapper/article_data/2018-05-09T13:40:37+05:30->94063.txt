NAGPUR: State government’s farm loan waiver scheme has unexpectedly led to profits at beleaguered   (NDCCB).   (RBI) had directed the cooperative to achieve a capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of 9% by March 2018. Till last year   could only get a CRAR of 8%. However, as bad loans were cleared through the waiver, the ratio has crossed 15%. This saves   from facing RBI heat. RBI had scrapped NDCCB’s licence in 2012 over inadequate CRAR.

 Due to the waiver, NDCCB profits for the year 2017-18 grew four times to Rs11.25 crore. The gross profit stood at Rs35 crore and provisions made out of it helped the bank reduce its accumulated losses to Rs204 crore from Rs216 crore in the last fiscal. The waiver got the bank Rs179 crore for 28,000 farmers whose loans were within Rs1.5 lakh qualifying for full waiver.
 
 District central cooperative banks mainly cater to agriculture sector. A majority of advances of such banks are short-term crop loans given. Since 2002, the bank is reeling under losses of an investment scam that took away Rs150 crore. Congress MLA Sunil Kedar is the main accused in the case in which the money meant to buy government securities was alleged to be siphoned away. This left the bank with piled up losses of over Rs200 core
 
 “Apart from what was lost in the scam, the bank was also sitting on huge NPAs from farmers. The amount which was not expected to be recovered was realized under the state’s waiver plan. This helped the bank clean up its balance sheet,” said a source.
 
 Yet the bank is left with over Rs270 crore NPAs, as farmers who did not fit in the scheme too are hoping to get a waiver, sources said. This includes 2,000 accounts where the loans were more than Rs1.5 lakh and had qualified for waiver. These farmers had to the clear dues over and above Rs1.5 lakh with state government contributing towards rest of the amount. “The loans to these 2000 borrowers comes to Rs85 crore. Even as government has cleared their case the farmers have not paid their share,” said a source. 
 
 Bank also has overdue farm loans of more than Rs300 crore. A loan is classified as NPA after two years of non-payment and is overdue from the first year of default.
 
 Sources said farmers were waiting for new waiver. It has been announced to extend the scheme to loan defaults from 2001 to 2009. Though an official order has not been issued, the move may cover loans worth another RS 90 crore.
