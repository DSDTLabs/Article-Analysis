 Party’s Talwandi Sabo candidate Baljinder Kaur’s election agent Neel Garg said, “According to the   (ECI) directions, our volunteers should be allowed within 100 m of the strong room, from where the lock could be seen. However, we are not being allowed within the permissible limit. We have taken up the matter with the authorities concerned.”
 
 Punjab chief electoral officer (CEO) VK Singh said, “Efforts are being made for volunteers of every political party to keep vigil on the strong rooms. The returning officers have been directed to make alternate arrangements of power backup in case of power failure. Other issues being raised by the parties are also being looked into.”
