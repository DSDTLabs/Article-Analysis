CHENNAI: Even as he was parrying questions on allegations linking him to an audio tape in which the assistant professor of a Virudhunagar college,  , is allegedly heard asking some students to offer sexual favours to higher-ups in   (MKU) in exchange of high scores and financial aid,   governor   got dragged into yet another controversy.

 A woman journalist, present during the media interaction at   on Tuesday, accused him of patting her on her cheek. The governor was clarifying his decision to order a probe into the audio tape issue.
 
 Soon after the media meeting, the woman journalist tweeted: “I asked TN Governor Banwarlilal Purohit a question as his press conference was ending. He decided to patronisingly — and without consent — pat me on the cheek as a reply.”
 
 DMK Rajya Sabha MP   was quick to react, tweeting, “Even if the intention is above suspicion, a person, who holds a public office has to understand that there is a decorum to it and violating a woman journalist’s personal space does not reflect the dignity or the respect which should be shown to any human being.”
