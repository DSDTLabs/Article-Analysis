KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Tuesday granted   to the   of late folk singer  . The accused — Arnab   — had been put behind the bars for the past two months and charged under the stringent culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC section 304 (II)). 

 The court on Tuesday also questioned the Hooghly police about the need to charge Rao under 304 (II) — a stricter and non bailable IPC section — rather than the section 304 (A) that pertains to death due to negligence, a section that is most frequently slapped in accident cases.
 
 “Why has the man been charged with Section 304 and not Section 304 (A)? Why is his statement still not recorded with the magistrate when he is in custody for the past 64 days?” Justice   of the two-member division bench observed while taking only three minutes to grant bail to 25-year-old Rao.
 
 The bench comprising Justice Asim Roy and   started hearing the plea on Tuesday afternoon after Rao’s lawyer filed a petition before the bench on Friday. A Chinsurah court had earlier cancelled his bail plea last week. 
 
 Praying for Rao’s bail on Tuesday, lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee argued that he was a mere driver of the hired car and was also not the owner of the vehicle. Hence, if indeed there is any mechanical defect in the car, he could not be held responsible, argued Chatterjee. 
 
 While granting bail, the bench put a condition that Rao will meet the investigating officer once a week and asked him to deposit two sureties of Rs 10,000 each.
