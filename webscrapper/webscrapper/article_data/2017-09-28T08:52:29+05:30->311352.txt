The victims were taken to Malpe nursing home and given injections to reduce pain. The fish is usually found when the water is cold and it comes close to the beach every year to lay eggs and find food. Stingrays are expected to be here for another week. The fish are found 15ft down to the beach area and hence we've been making announcements about not getting into the deep sea.“

 Dr Surendra Shetty , medical officer, Malpe nursing home, said, “The victims were in extreme pain. We wash the affected area with hot water which destabilizes the venom within half an hour and give them an antibiotic injection. The pain lasts for a day and they have to follow this for almost a month. It is not deadly.“
