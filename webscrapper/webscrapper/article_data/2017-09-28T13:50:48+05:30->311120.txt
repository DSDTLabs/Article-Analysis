PORVORIM: Chief minister   on Wednesday declared that the   scheme, targeting mining dependents, has been extended till December 2017.

 Addressing reporters post the state cabinet meet, Parrikar said the scheme has been extended as some mining affected traders were unable to avail of the scheme because of technical difficulties.
 
 The scheme offered financial assistance to mining  , barge owners and others. “There are about 30 applicants” said Parrikar, when asked how many more were likely to benefit from the extension.
 
 Parrikar, however, clarified that the extended date will not be applicable for new applications, but the applications rejected on technical ground would be considered. With the extension of the scheme, Parrikar said the government will incur an expense to the tune Rs 10 to Rs 12 crore.
