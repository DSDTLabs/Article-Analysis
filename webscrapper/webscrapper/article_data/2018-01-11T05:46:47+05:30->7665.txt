NEW DELHI: Slain Kannada writer and rationalist MM Kalburgi’s wife told the   on Wednesday that emerging evidence made it essential that a composite probe be initiated into her husband’s murder along with the killings of scholars Govindrao Pansare and Narendra Achyut Dabholkar.

 The SC sought the response of probe agencies   and CBI and the governments of Maharashtra and Karnataka within six weeks on her allegation that no substantial investigation has been carried out so far in the murder case. A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices AM Khanwilkar and   took note of the petition filed by   Kalburgi, wife of the author, and issued the notices.
 
 Umadevi said there was common link between the murder of her husband and those of intellectuals Narendra Dabholkar and Govindrao Pansare, who were assassinated in Pune in August 2013 and in Kolhapur in Feb 2015, respectively.
 
 
 
 
 Kalburgi’s wife said the probe into Dabholkar and Pansare cases was in a “sorry state” and no progress has been made in bringing the killers to book. The petition said that in 2016, then Karnataka home minister had claimed that as per the forensic analysis of cartridges recovered from the three separate crime scenes, the three murders were linked.
 
 It alleged that one of the weapons used in the murder of Pansare was used to kill Kalburgi and, therefore, coordination between Maharashtra police and Karnataka police, besides CBI and NIA, was required.
 
 “Although sketches of suspects were released four days after Kalburgi’s murder and a statement was issued by the government that conclusive evidence of nexus of murders of all three activists was found, there has been no progress in the probe,” the plea said.
