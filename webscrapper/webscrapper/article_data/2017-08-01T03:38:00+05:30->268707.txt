Panaji: BJP’s Vinay   took oath as member of Parliament, representing Goa, in the Rajya Sabha, in Delhi, on Monday. In a move that was widely celebrated by party workers on social media, Tendulkar took oath in Konkani.

 Tendulkar was elected to the Rajya Sabha earlier this month after defeating Congress’ Shantaram Naik, who was the sitting member of Parliament. This is the first time that a non-Congress candidate has won the Rajya Sabha election in Goa. Tendulkar is the Goa BJP president and the party wants him to continue shouldering the responsibility. tnn
