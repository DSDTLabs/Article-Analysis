CHENNAI: The advocate general on Monday informed the Madras high court that the state government will issue, within a week, an order recalling the earlier appointed chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

 The advocate general said the state government had taken a decision to recall the order appointing  , who was former vice-chancellor of   (MKU), as the chairperson. The state government would also issue a proper advertisement calling for application, following which the fresh applications would be processed.
 
 Social activist and   director A Narayanan had filed a PIL seeking mandatory registration of child care homes in the state and to close down all illegal homes not maintaining minimum facilities.
 
 On Monday, Narayanan said while going through the fresh process, the authorities could consider the notification issued by the central government prescribing the process to be followed, which in turn, was the result of the directions passed by the Supreme Court dated February 25, 2014.
 
 He underlined that rules were not framed under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act because of which at district level, the child welfare committees and juvenile justice boards remained dysfunctional. This required urgent attention, he said.
 
  The advocate general then said he would ensure that urgent steps are taken in this behalf.
 
 The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar posted the matter for further hearing on List on March 10.
