DHARAMSHALA: Two girls living in a rented accomodation at Sakoh village in Kangra district died on Thursday after allegedly consuming a medicine. Both were MBA fourth semester students and hailed from Barsar area of Hamirpur district.

 Police, who have started proceedings in the case under Section 174 (enquire and report on suicide) of Code of Criminal Procedure, identified the two as   (22) and Vandana (21). They have taken possession of medicines, laptops, mobile phones and pen drives from their room. “Just before her death, Diksha told the doctors at   Zonal hospital that they had consumed Nimesulide tablets before going to sleep,” Kangra superintendent of police Santosh Patial said.
 
 Police officials said information gathered by them revealed that the two girls had their dinner between 9pm to 10pm on Wednesday and went to sleep after that. Around 2am, Diksha informed her landlord about their deteriorating health. The landlord told cops that while Diksha could walk, Vandana could hardly do so and was vomiting continuously. He took them to the zonal hospital in Dharamshala, from where they were referred to Dr   at Tanda in Kangra.
 
 “Diksha died around 3.25am and Vandana around 6am. Their families were already informed and their bodies handed over to their family members after postmortem,” said Patial. He said that their postmortem report stated cardio respiratory failure due to suspected poisoning as reason for the girls’ death.
 
 Police did not find any poisonous substance from the girls’ room except anti-allergic or painkiller medicines, which they have sent them for chemical examination.
 
 A Tanda medical college doctor said, “There is hardly any chance of a person dying after consuming Nimesulide medicine.” he said requesting anonymity.
