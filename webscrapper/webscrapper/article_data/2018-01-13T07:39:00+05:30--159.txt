JALANDHAR: Punjab irrigation and power minister   said on Friday that the previous SAD-BJP government increased financial burden on the state by agreeing to pay the difference of Rs 30,000 crore in Central funds and expenditure on procurement of grains.

 “The state is already short of funds as the SAD-BJP created a financial mess and then just before going out of power, the previous regime agreed to treat this amount as loan. Now we have to pay interest on that also,” he said. 
 
 On the   describing this as a major scam and demanding a high-level probe,   said as the department is with the chief minister, it is not proper for him to comment. He also asked SAD leaders to explain what did they do to waive off farmers’ debt before commenting on the waiver being given by the state government now.
