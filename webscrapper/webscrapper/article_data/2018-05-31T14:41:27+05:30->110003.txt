INDORE: Narmada   in several   was disrupted on Wednesday because of repair work being carried out in its line by Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC).

 
 Officials said that tanks in Vidur Nagar, Dhanwantir Nagar, Buddha Nagar, Chhatri Bagh, Subhash Chowk and   could not be filled owing to the shut down in second phase of   network. “This affected the piped supply of water to around 80 areas,” said IMC water works department head Balram Verma.
 
 Krishnapura, MTH Compound, Mrignayani, Ranipura are some of the areas that witnessed disruption in water supply.
 
 Verma said that the repair work got delayed owing to technical reasons, which affected the supply leading to the crisis. “We had expected that the tanks could be filled, but they could not owing to low pressure. Though the piped supply was affected, we provided supply through alternate lines to avoid any crisis in the areas connected with second phase of Narmada supply network,” he said. 
 
 He explained that earlier there was a leakage in 1400MLD supply line between Chhoti Khargone and Jalood pumping station. “Though the leakage was repaired, its valves were to be connected, for which the line was shut down,” he said. 
 
 Tankers were pressed in service to supply water in affected areas. “Places like Subhash Nagar and Gandhi Hall, where there was zero supply, water was provided through private tankers,” Verma added. 
 
 Water scarcity resulting from pipeline leakages and fault at pumping station has become a regular problem for the city. Decades old pipeline network hamper the supply on regular basis.
