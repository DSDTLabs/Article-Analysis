   Mukherjee is a popular face in Sandalwood, but she’s also not a stranger to television. The actor had made a foray into the   world in 2006 even before mainstream actors making small screen appearances had come into vogue.
  Now a decade after Anu entered the TV fray, she has, for the first time, signed on to star in a full-fledged mega daily soap. Titled  , the show will see the actor star along with another well-known cinema personality,  .
  “The only reason I took up this project is because I related to it on a personal level. The story revolves around a man and a woman — both middle-aged and unmarried, who the society feels will never be able to find a match given their so-called age bracket. But they have both willed to not tie the knot until they both meet someone who matches his/her mindset. It was this aspect that clinched it for me,” says Anu. She adds, “I was also at that stage in my life and I’m glad to have found my soul mate in Raghu (Mukherjee). Age is never a deterrent when it comes to marriage; what truly matters is compatibility. Hence, this was a subject that was so relatable and I knew instantly that this is the kind of message I want to share with the society,” states the actor, who essays a veena player in the serial and finds love in Rajesh, a music aficionado.
  Anu shares that television is challenging and that it keeps you on your toes. “Having said that, I don’t see myself waking up picture perfect with coiffured hair and lipstick like what we see on TV otherwise. Nor will I play victim in one of those saas-bahu sagas. I’m more interested in progressive content,” she signs off.
