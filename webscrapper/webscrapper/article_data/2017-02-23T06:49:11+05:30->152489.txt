THANE: To bring back the chirpy twitter of the depleting sparrow population across the state, the forest department will kickstart its unique sparrow breeding programme.

 As part of this project, which is the brainchild of forest minister  , forest officials and an NGO from Pune,  , will set up thousands of artificial sparrow nests in Pune city, rural Pune, Alibaug and Thane.
 
 Chief conservator of forests, Sunil  , said that change in people's lifestyle, over the last few decades, has proved harmful for sparrows.“These birds that built nests in niches of rustic homes couldn't do so in the new buildings. Their breeding slowed down and with it, their population decreased,“ said Limaye.
 
 The department started a pilot study by setting up 200 nests in parts of Pune in 2014. Now, the team will kick-start this initiative in Thane, Alibaug and other Rural and urban Pune this April.
 
 Ornithologist Satish Pande, founder of Ela Foundation which is working on the scientific aspects of this project, said, “We created around 200 nests and placed them near homes.We also provided the birds with food. Two years later, around 75% of these nests are constantly occupied,“ said Pandey.
 
 The department has sent the proposal to the ministry for a budget of Rs 20 lakh. It is slated to begin by April this year.
