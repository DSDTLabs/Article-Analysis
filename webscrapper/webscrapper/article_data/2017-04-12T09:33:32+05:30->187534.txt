KOCHI:  , who received the national award for  , said on Tuesday that the film field is not as unsafe for women as it is perceived to be. 

 "Work in the film field cannot be deemed as dangerous for women per se. Whatever is troubling the society at large will be reflected here as well, which doesn't mean that the profession is especially unsafe for women," Surabhi said when asked if her profession is perilous for women.

 The 30-year-old actress said that age is not and should not be a problem for acting in varied roles.
 
 "There is no problem for elderly actors portraying a role that is younger to them, and vice versa. But I think it is more challenging to play an elderly role by a young actor, as they have never gone through that phase of life, but just observed them from outside," she said.
