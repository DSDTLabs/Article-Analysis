GURUGRAM: The environment, forest and climate change ministry (MoEFCC) has started an   into   in the   in   at a site allotted to a   company, a Haryana forest department source said on Friday. 

 “An inquiry is being carried out to analyze the objections raised by a few environmentalists. If required, a survey can be carried out,” said the source. The findings are likely to be submitted in the National Green Tribunal, which is hearing a case against the tree-felling. 
 
 Environmental activists have been up in arms over felling of 6,000 trees in June on a 52-acre plot by the real estate company. A petition was filed in the NGT by green activist Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi, alleging the state had granted permission to chop trees in a “deemed forest”.
 
 According to environmentalists, the area falls under the Aravali Notification, 1992. “Even though the notification was given in a Gurgaon-specific case, it is applicable to the entire Aravalis. Moreover, it is a deemed forest and falls under NCZ (natural conservation zone). Permission to fell trees here was, therefore, a violation,” said Vivek Kamboj of Haryali, an NGO.
 
 The activists had proposed a survey after the last NGT hearing. “A committee was set up by NGT on June 19 to conduct a survey. Before it could visit the site, the Haryana government granted permission to have the trees cut, which took place overnight. The best way to determine the number of trees is through a survey conducted by a competent agency,” said Jitender Bhadana, a Faridabad-based activist. The next NGT hearing is scheduled for July 24.
