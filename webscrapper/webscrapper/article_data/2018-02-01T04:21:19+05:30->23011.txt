MUMBAI: The state transport department may soon introduce the QR code system to weed out illegal autorickshaws from city roads. An estimated 40,000 illegal autos ply across the Mumbai metropolitan region, mainly in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai.

 The QR code system will help authorities identify such autos and deny them fuel (CNG), an RTO official said. “If we cut off their fuel supply, it will be difficult to run these autos. They will automatically go off roads,” he stated.
 
 Officials propose stickers with QR codes that can be affixed on every  . A QR code (Quick Response Code) is a type of matrix barcode which can efficiently store a lot of data/information that can be revealed on being scanned.
 
 “We can use the code to store data of every vehicle, date of purchase and life span of the autorickshaw, expiry of permit, whether the auto has been sent for scrap/condemned and the personal details of vehicle owner,” an official stated.
 
 If an illegal auto enters a CNG station, the validator machine installed at the pump will automatically detect if there is a QR code. “If the vehicle is found plying without permit or is a scrapped v ehicle, the CNG dispenser will not provide any fuel,” an official said.
 
 The transport department plans to team up with traffic police, Mahanagar Gas and recognised auto unions to implement the system.
 
 Said Kurien, who leads the Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union, “This is an effective system to curb illegal vehicles and ensure only bona fide drivers and vehicles operate.” He said auto unions would demand stringent punishment for errant drivers.
