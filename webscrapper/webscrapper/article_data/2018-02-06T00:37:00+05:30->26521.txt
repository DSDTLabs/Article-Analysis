Mangaluru: Dakshina Kannad district administration is mulling introducing the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system followed in Singapore in Mangaluru city to address the issue of traffic rush during peak hours.  Under ERP system, private vehicle owners have to pay certain amount to enter the city during peak hours. The amount will be deducted from e-wallets of the drivers of the vehicles or the owners.  At a meeting of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) chaired by him on Monday, deputy commissioner S Sasikanth Senthil said that the district administration is mulling introducing ERP system in the city limits.  He said the ERP system will ease the traffic congestion besides helping pedestrians in the city. “We have plans to introduce the ERP system for private vehicles to reduce the number of vehicles entering the city,” the DC said. The system will reduce the number of private vehicles entering areas where traffic density is more, especially the central business district area, he said. However, he added, “the system will be introduced only after holding discussions with officials and people’s representatives. Very soon, a meeting in this regard will be held to decide the type of vehicles to be brought under ERP regulation. Widening of roads by demolishing existing buildings, including monuments in the city, is not an ideal solution to adress the traffic problems.” He said that the new system will also result in reduction of pollution levels in the city. In addition, people will also develop the habit of walking, which is also good for health.” The ERP system, which does not require any major investment, can be introduced along with the Smart City mission.
