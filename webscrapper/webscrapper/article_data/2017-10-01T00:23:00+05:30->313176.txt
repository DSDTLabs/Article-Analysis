Trichy: T T V Dhinakaran and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan met the family members of Anitha, the girl who committed suicide after she was unable to secure an MBBS seat after implementation of NEET, and handed over a sum of Rs 15 lakh as financial assistance in Kuzhumur on Saturday. The family member had earlier rejected the financial aid of Rs 7 lakh offered by the state government.

 AIADMK (Amma) leader TTV Dhinakaran who reached Kuzhumur along with his support MLAs met T Shanmugham and S Manirathnam, father and brother respectively, of Anitha and handed out the financial aid. Sources said that as many as 20 AIADMK MLAs (including 18 disqualified MLAs) contributed Rs 50,000 each and Rs 5 lakh was contributed from the party’s fund.
 
 “I would like to reiterate that the incident of providing financial aid to Anitha’s family was not done for political gains. All political parties in the state should work together in protecting the state’s rights and for that matter any issue that affects the livelihood of Tamil Nadu’s people, be it NEET or Neduvasal,” Dhinakaran told media persons at Kuzhumur. 
 
 Even though the victim’s family refused to accept the Tamil Nadu government’s solatium of Rs 7 lakh a few weeks back, the financial aid offered by the sidelined AIADMK leader was accepted by Anitha’s family. 
 
 “Unlike the state government, Dhinakaran opposed NEET and even conducted a public meeting in Trichy expressing his support to scrap NEET,” Manirathnam told TOI after accepting the aid. VCK’s Thirumavalavan who accompanied Dhinakaran at Kuzhumur said that State should protest until NEET was scrapped.
