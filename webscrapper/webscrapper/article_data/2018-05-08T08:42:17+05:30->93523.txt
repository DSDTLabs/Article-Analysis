MUMBAI: Members of  , convinced that the   has for the first time offered to hear them out in the matter involving implementation of   recommendations, are ready with the bullet points that need to be submitted to  , the Amicus Curaie, ahead of the May 11, 2018 hearing.

 
 The apex court has asked state associations of the Board to suggest changes in the draft constitution filed by the   (CoA) on October 27 last year. A three-day deadline was given for the filing of these “bullet points” and the court has categorically stated that once this draft constitution is approved (by SC), it shall stand finalised and not be debated upon.
 
  The members’ foremost plea to the SC, TOI has learnt, is that “continuity in the roles and responsibility” of the initial office-bearers should be allowed for BCCI to begin functioning “normally”. In doing so, state associations want SC to pick administrative guidelines from some of the top sports bodies anywhere in the world - the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for instance - in setting the parameters.
 
 Below are the “bullet points” that members intend to present to the SC: › Do away with the cooling-off period for office-bearers so that there is continuity in the administration. Cooling-off clause can exist to ensure that an office-bearer is not eligible to contest for the same post once again after a three-year term - a regulation that already exists in the BCCI constitution. “You need some experience to run a sports body of this magnitude too, especially when you’re looking at the administrative role from a pan-India and global perspective,” say members.
 
 - It will remain the Supreme Court’s prerogative to define whether an age-cap needs to exist for office-bearers. However, members want the three-judge bench to ensure that BCCI can appoint individuals as advisors/representatives to various committees regardless of the age-cap, once again to ensure that experience comes handy where administration is concerned.
 
 - Members want SC to clarify that the January 3, 2017 order be read in line with the original order dated July 2016 - which in turn makes the FAQs submitted by the Justice RM Lodha Committee redundant. In line with it, state associations say tenure of office-bearers should be extended from nine years to 12 so that an office-bearer can run for all posts but not repeat the tenure. The primary office-bears constitute the president, secretary, joint secretary and treasurer - all with a term of three years each.
 
 - SC has already questioned the one-state, one-vote reform which a section of BCCI members had been protesting. In line with it, members say states from northeast should first begin to nurture cricketing interests in the region - which BCCI will be ready to aid financially and technically - before they begin to look at voting rights in the Board.
 
 - Regardless of whether a working committee or an apex council - recommended by the Lodha panel - continues to be in place, members want a complete representation of BCCI in the constituted body so that there is a democratic process in place and every stakeholder is heard at all times.
 
 
 
 The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) had filed a draft constitution for the BCCI in October last year. The court has asked for suggestions from state associations to see if changes need to be made to this draft constitution. While members get busy filing the “bullet points” as ordered by the SC, the CoA is also free to make amendments to the draft constitution filed in 2017. It could not be ascertained whether the CoA will be doing the same ahead of the hearing scheduled on Friday.
