LUDHIANA: While giving one month’s ultimatum to the state government, Lok Insaaf Party MLAs   and Balwinder Bains have demanded   inquiry into the audio tape released around one and a half months ago by them in which conversation regarding payment to a high court judge to restrict relief to AAP MLA and leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira could be heard. 

 The MLAs have said if the government fails to conduct a CBI inquiry, they will file a PIL in the Punjab and Haryana high court over this issue. 
 
 While addressing the media persons Simarjit Bains alleged that on November 27 2017 they had released an audio tape in Chandigarh in which former deputy advocate general was telling a former PCS officer T K Goel that Rs 35 lakh has been paid to a judge so that Khaira’ review petition in the HC, for the charges against him to be quashed, was dismissed. Khaira was summoned by Fazilka court for questioning regarding his alleged involvement with drugs smugglers. 
 
 Simarjit said he had gone along with Khaira to meet chief justice of HC over the issue. He said instead of any step on behalf of the CBI, a resolution was passed against them in the assembly criticizing their step of releasing the audio tape. He added whenever any resolution has to pass through assembly, its copy is provided to all 117 MLAs. However, in the said case a paper was handed over to Punjab CM Captain   by advocate general of Punjab Atul   after which the resolution was passed. 
 
 Simarjit said they he has firm believe in the judiciary but the touts are defaming the judicial system and judges which needs to be stopped. He said the recent press conference by four judges of Supreme Court have also raised the concerns as they have clearly stated that democracy is in danger.
