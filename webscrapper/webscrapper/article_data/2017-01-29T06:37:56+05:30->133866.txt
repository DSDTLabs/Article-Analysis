AHMEDABAD: In a notification issued on Saturday, city police have downgraded the threat perception from   in certain areas in   declared 'affected' and where restrictions were imposed.

 The notification says the city police have received a circular from the office of the district's deputy animal husbandry director in which it is mentioned that the affected area in Memnagar has been sanitized according to rules and a sanitization certificate has been issued.
 
 “On January 12, a notification was issued in which the city police commissioner had the declared area within 1 km radius of   in Memnagar as ‘affected area’. The notification had banned activities such as running a poultry farm, bringing in or taking out poultry birds and their eggs. Sale of poultry items was also prohibited,” a police official said.
 
 According to the notification issued on Saturday, the 'restricted zone' has been converted into 'surveillance zone' where the banned activities can now be carried out but with prescribed caution. Poultry from the area would be restricted to the area as a precaution, police officials said.
 
 City police have already started investigation in the source of bird flu and had worked closely in both Hathijan and Memnagar areas along with the state’s animal husbandry department once the bird flu scare was confirmed.
