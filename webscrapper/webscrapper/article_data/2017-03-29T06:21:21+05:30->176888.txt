PUNE: Activists have demanded an explanation for the sudden transfer of   commissioner   to Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML).

  activist   told TOI that the government was not following the Transfer Act 2005, which entails that a bureaucrat has to serve a minimum three years in one posting. “Unless the case is exceptional, bureaucrats cannot be transferred,’’ stated Kumbhar in his letter to Chief Minister   on Monday.
 
 He said that the government has been giving reasons like it is in the “interest of the people’ for shuffling bureaucrats before they complete the term.
 
 Kumbhar cited the example of shifting of former Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner  . The activists had sought help from the Chief Information Commissioner to ascertain the reasons for the transfer order. The commissioner had issued instructions that the reasons should be made public within eight days. The reasons cited were ‘official reasons” and “interest of the people”. “These are not the reasons for the transfers, which are merely political,’’ stated Kumbhar.
 
 He said that Tukaram Mundhe had locked horns with the government on the issue of illegal construction, encroachment and corruption and the political parties were keen to shunt him out. While the corporators and officials were against him, he was largely supported by citizens who appreciated his work. “We oppose his sudden transfer and request that rules are not bent for political reasons,’’ said Kumbhar.
