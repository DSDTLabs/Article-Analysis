HYDERABAD: Demanding the state government to withdraw government order numbers 48, 50 - which facilitates lease of 10 acres of the 73-acre Victoria Memorial Home at   to the Rachakonda commissionerate, the   Students' Lands Protection Committee gave a call for relay hunger strike starting from Monday. 

 The committee demanded the state to immediately withdraw its orders and set up intermediate, degree, PG and technical residential colleges for orphan children in the VM Home campus and said that they will organize relay hunger strikes till October 8 to demand the same.
 
 "The government has no right to allot the trust's land unilaterally. It is not their land. It is the responsibility of the government to protect and develop in it the interest of orphans. Now, it is the responsibility of civil societies and organizations to fight against this decision. The government should set up residential colleges for orphans in the open land of Victoria Memorial Home," said Buchi Reddy L, convener of the committee.
 
 The committee said that the government should also release the thirty-five crore rupees due from Rythu Bazar to VM Home without further delay.
 
 "The land of 'etimkhana' (orphanage) belongs to a trust. The Nizam endowment has made it clear that the trust will have no power to lease or sell it. Despite all this the ruling parties have leased some portions of the land to Rythu bazaar, Babu Jagjeevanram Bhavan, Reliance company, and Rachakonda commissionarate, thus ignoring the welfare of orphans," said N Narayana, co-convener of the committee and requested the public, intellectuals, civilians,  ,  , and to fight against the government for the withdrawal of the GOs forthwith.
