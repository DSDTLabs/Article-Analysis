HYDERABAD: Not just the  , to resolve marriage issues, several people have been approaching private detectives to investigate their partners’ affairs. A city-based private detective has said they get 30 such cases every month on an average.

 “We get nearly 30-60 cases a month to investigate, of which almost 50% of the cases are regarding extramarital affairs. It is not just the women who approach us, an equal number of male clients also approach us,” said Ravinder  , a private detective from Third eye investigations.
 
 Though 98% of the time detectives find no instance of an extramarital affair, it becomes hard to convince their client, they say. "It is as if they want their suspicion to be true," said Reddy. Shockingly, people spend a huge amount of money on investigation. According to the detective, most spend Rs 20,000 and above for investigating their partners. "The company charges Rs 20,000 to over Rs 60,000 for such an investigation. It takes a week to 10 days for us to give them initial finding," he said.
