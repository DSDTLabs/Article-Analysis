CHANDIGARH: The first session of Punjab legislative assembly started on a quiet note on Friday, with 115 of the state’s 117 MLAs taking oath. Former chief minister   and his son, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) supremo Sukhbir Badal, were the only two legislators who were absent, after their party was relegated to the third place in the assembly elections.

 The session also marked the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP’s) debut in the assembly. All MLAs of the party, led by Dhaka MLA H S Phoolka, were in attendance. There was evident curiosity in the seating of Congress. The first row was taken by leaders from Patiala district. In the first bench, chief minister   (75), health minister Brahm Mohindra (70), and Navjot Sidhu, who was in the eye of storm last week over his TV career, were seated from left to right.
 
 Sidhu hails from Patiala, but has always contested his Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections from Amritsar. 
 
 The loudest celebrations took place when Congress’s young legislators, like Fazilka MLA   Ghubaya (25),   Angad Saini (26), Dhuri MLA Dalvir Singh Goldy (34), and Bawa Henry (35), took oath. They became louder when Gidderbaha MLA Raja Warring walked barefoot to take his oath.
 
 In AAP’s corner, clad in a blue turban, Phoolka was flanked by his party’s richest legislator, Sunam MLA Aman Arora, and Bholath MLA Sukhpal Khaira. While most of the MLAs took their pledge in Punjabi, education minister Aruna Chouhdary took the oath in English.
