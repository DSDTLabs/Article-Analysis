PANAJI: Kadamba   (KTCL) and   ( ) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for training of KTCL’s drivers. The training programme can save the state transport corporation crores of rupees on fuel, chief minister   said after the signing of the MoU.

 “The MoU is being signed in order to ensure that drivers are trained to drive buses safely and with more fuel efficiency. There are some wrong practices, like using the clutch at the wrong time. Training will ensure that they drive more efficiently. If   can save even 0.5km per litre, that itself will be a few crores. So, fuel efficiency can change the scenario towards better driving,” Parrikar said.
 
 KTCL chairman Carlos Almeida said that the 800-odd drivers who will participate in the programme will be provided with certificates. “I have also requested the CM to have the same seminar for private bus drivers as well after KTCL is done,” he added.
 
 PCRA director Alok Tripathi said, “By merely improving driving skill you can save fuel to the extent of 10%. The total amount of fuel consumed in the commercial vehicle segment is 50 million metric tonnes and this training programme is focused on this particular segment. If we train all these drivers then we are going to straightaway have a saving of 5 million metric tonnes per annum, which is a huge saving.”
 
 The driver training programme will be a three-day module. PCRA will first assess the driving skill of the driver, detect their weaknesses in the context of fuel efficiency and provide inputs.
 
 “The MoU has been entered into till March 31, 2019, but we will be able finish the training in six months. Based on certain parameters, we will identify five drivers, who will be suitably rewarded during PCRA’s Saksham month. This will be on January 16, 2019,” Tripathi added.
