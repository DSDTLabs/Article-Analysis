NOIDA:   has asked the additional director general of police (Meerut zone) to monitor the probe into the alleged murder of BHEL deputy general manager   last month, a day after the executive’s family wrote to the Prime Minister seeking an investigation by the CBI. 

 Pandey’s parents Narvadeshwar and   and his brother-in-law   met DGP Singh and ADGP (Meerut zone)   at the SSP’s office around 2pm on Monday. 
 
 Dwivedi told TOI that they had handed over a letter to the DGP saying they were not being kept posted about the progress of the probe in the case. “We think they are only misguiding us… so that time will pass,” read the letter.
 
 Police sources said the cops were trying to establish the robbery angle in the murder of the BHEL executive. While Pandey’s bag was missing, an expensive watch he was wearing was found intact. The police are yet to trace the official’s cellphone.
 
 Pandey was found dead near a drain in Sector 105 with a bullet wound near the chest.
 
 Singh apparently told Pandey’s family they were under “extreme pressure” to crack the case as early as possible. The DGP then asked ADGP (Meerut zone) to monitor the probe into the murder case.
 
 Kumar said police in Gautam Budh Nagar were yet to get any breakthrough in the case. “The police are working on the case but are yet to get the exact clues,” he said.
