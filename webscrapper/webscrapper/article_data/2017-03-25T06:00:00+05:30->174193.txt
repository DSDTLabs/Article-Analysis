Director   has roped in   to play a special role in his next — NTR starrer,  . And the actress is elated. “It’s an important cameo and I joined the shoot five days back. This is the second time I’m working with NTR after   and trust me, all of us are having a laugh riot on the sets, thanks to NTR. He is so much fun to work with,” says the actress adding, “Tarak is playing a triple role in the film and each character looks very different from the other. So every time he changes into a different avatar, he becomes almost unrecognisable leaving everyone amazed.”

 Grill her about her role in the film and she reluctantly says, “I play a modern girl who works as a manager in a company. So I will be seen sporting smart casuals.” Ask her if she is doing a special song in the film? “You will have to watch the film to find out,” she says, signing off.
