Mumbai: The opposition in the   legislative council demanded action against BJP MLA Anil Gote, who demand that the council be scrapped. A section of Shiv Sena MLCs also opposed Gote’s demand and said that all MLCs should make common cause on the issue.

 On Thursday, Gote demanded the scrapping of the legislative council in a statement in the   assembly. “The legislative council does not have constitutional rights. MLAs from the lower House make laws, which get stalled in the upper House,” he said.
 
 He added that the late BJP stalwart Rambhau Mhalgi had called the legislative council a “historic accident”. 
 
 The opposition leader in the council, Dhananjay Munde, said that a member of the legislative assembly had no right to speak about council. “However, Gote spoke to the media on the issue even after the speaker removed his remarks from the proceedings. Hence, action should be taken against him,” said Munde. Congress leader Sharad Ranpise endorsed the demand.
