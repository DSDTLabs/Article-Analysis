NAVI MUMBAI: In view of overall good production of vegetables, supply of several vegetables from neigbouring states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka has led to a surplus in the market.   of some crops have sustained losses, and there was little that the government could do as it was difficult to have a regulatory policy for each and every crop, said the APMC.

 Vegetable supplies at the APMC wholesale market this winter has doubled. The daily supply is pegged at 70-80 tonnes comprising some 600 vehicles – a mix of trucks and tempos. “The crop has been better in the last two years,” said Shivaji Pahinkar, APMC Mumbai secretary. The APMC comes under the agriculture and marketing department of the state government. Farmers growing tomato, brinjal and leafy vegetables are reported to have sustained losses, said the APMC. The loss is also on account of flooding of the market with farm produce from neigbouring states and farmers having to sell the stock cheap in view of increased supplies.
 
 Broccoli is largely supplied from Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Wholesale prices have plummeted while retailers have pocketed the benefit. Pahinkar added, “There is very little that the government can do to contain the crash while there is no mechanism to control the retail trade. This year, the overall crop production has been good in the country. Pahinkar reasoned that it was difficult for the government to intervene into each and every crop, and so the government could do little to contain the fall in price, but if there was a concerted step by all state governments then the supplies could be regulated. “A micro level planning will also be required as in what to sow and when besides more food processing units to match demand and supply,” he said.
