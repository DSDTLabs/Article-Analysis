PANAJI: Highlighting CCP’s plight, mayor   said the corporation receives neither house tax nor   from state and   staying in government quarters in and around Panaji.

 “All the government staff residing at Altinho, Patto and St Inez, and all central government staff in different parts of Panaji don’t pay us garbage or house tax,” Furtado said and added that a government servant has rent deducted from his salary, pays for his telephone connection, electricity and water bills. 
 
 “Why should CCP get step motherly treatment?” he questioned. 
 
  from house rent is spent on paying the Rs 1.5 crore salary of its staff, Furtado said. “For the last six years the   has not given us salary grants to the tune of Rs 15 crore. With no funds, how do you expect Panaji to shine? It’s easy to say CCP is increasing house tax and garbage tax. It’s Rs 1 a day. Why do people of Panaji have to complaint about Rs 1,” he said. 
 
 Furtado added that municipal workers climb up the floors of old government buildings to collect garbage.
