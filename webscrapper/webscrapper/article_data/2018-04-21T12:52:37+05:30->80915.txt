VADODARA: The Vadodara railway division of   has approved the design of the   satellite railway station. 

 While the tenders for construction of the new railway station have been accepted, the work on the project has started in full swing, railway division officials said on Friday. 
 
 The railway division has set the goal of completing construction of the station building by December this year. 
 
 With financial assistance of the   which is implementing the   bullet train project, the Chhayapuri railway station is being developed at a cost of around Rs 40 crore. 
 
 Because of the high speed rail corridor being developed between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, the Vadodara railway station will get one less platform for regular train movement. 
 
 The new station building will have several passenger amenities including two high level platforms, foot over bridges, waiting hall while a circulating area will also be developed. 
 
 The satellite railway station is being developed to reduce congestion at Vadodara railway station which witnesses movement of more than 200 passenger carrying trains that pass through the station in 24 hours. 
 
 Once, Chhayapuri starts functioning as satellite station, around 6 to 7 trains coming from Delhi and   towards Ahmedabad, will not arrive at Vadodara railway station. Instead, they will get diverted to Chhayapuri station thereby reducing the traffic at Vadodara station and save passengers’ time. 
 
 “The crowd of passengers will also get reduced at Vadodara railway station. Apart from this, punctuality of trains between Vadodara and Surat will also improve,” said an official.
 
 It was in February this year that the foundation stone for developing the satellite railway station was laid.
