AHMEDABAD: In a   and bootleggers, a team of 400   led by two   and four ACP rank officers managed to seize only 300 litres of country liquor and 90 quarter bottles of IMFL.

 In wake of protests by independent MLA Jignesh Mevani about rampant liquor trafficking in Gomtipur and other city areas.
 
 Senior police officials claim that the anti-liquor drive was aimed at ending the liquor menace in eastern parts of the city. Police said drinking leads to escalation of crime and so curbing the menace is necessary. “Such combing drives will be conducted periodically in all areas of the city to ensure that flow of liquor in the city is blocked,” said a senior police official. ACP Sector-2, Ashok Yadav, told reporters that during the drive they verified about 300 history-sheeters. Yadav said, fresh photos of the accused were taken and their latest cellphone numbers recorded.
 
 The crackdown began early in the morning at about 5 am with police vehicles zooming into areas like Sardarnagar, Naroda, Krishnanagar, Meghaninagar, Ramol, Amraiwadi, Rakhial, Odhav, Gomtipur, Bapunagar, Maninagar, Isanpur, Vatva, Narol and Kagdapith areas of the city which are infamous for illegal trafficking and sale of country liquor.
 
 The police claim to have seized 8,000 litres of ‘wash’ used to make country liquor, and that more than 50 cases were registered against 40 people. However, with cops knocking at the doors at 5 am in the morning, many locals of Sardarnagar and other areas had to face a tough time. “Not all living in Charanagar area are criminals. Why should they be harassed at odd hours of the day?” said a local resident who declined to identify himself.
