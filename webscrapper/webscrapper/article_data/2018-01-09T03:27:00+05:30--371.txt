Panaji: The state government has constituted an eight-member special investigation team (SIT) to investigate the 2013 House committee report on police-drug mafia nexus submitted by then Nuvem MLA Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco. The team, which will function under the supervision of the crime branch of the Goa Police, will be headed by DySP Edwin Colaco and will comprise PI Uday Naik, PSI Jacques Sheriff, head constables Carlos Pontes and Ashok Gaude, and constables Ishwar Kaskar, Vinayak Sawant and Kalpaesh Toraskar. Last week, the Goa Police had forwarded the names of these police personnel to the government for its approval. The newly-formed SIT has been tasked with investigating the House committee report and taking the necessary action. The state government had, in September 2015, asked the anti-corruption branch (ACB) of the vigilance department to investigate the police-drug mafia nexus. The unit, however, didn’t conduct any probes on the ground that the matter didn’t fall within its scope. In its report submitted to the state assembly in October 2013, the House committee, headed by Pacheco, had indicted former home minister Ravi Naik, his son Roy, and several police officers from the rank of DGP to constable, in a police-drug mafia nexus.  However, two members of the committee, St Andre MLA Vishnu Wagh, and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, hadn’t agreed with some aspects of the report and had sent a note of dissent to the speaker.
