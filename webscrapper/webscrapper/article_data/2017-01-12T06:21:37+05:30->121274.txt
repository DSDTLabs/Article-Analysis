PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: From just three corporators in the 128-member strong   in 2012 the   is hoping to wrest power from the NCP in the forthcoming civic election on February 21. 

 The NCP in Pimpri Chinchwad, led by former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, has won the 2007 and 2012 civic elections with a huge majority, and will pitch its work on development projects to voters for retaining power. 
 
 In the run-up to the elections, the BJP has been accusing the NCP of corruption and irregularities in these development works which the NCP leaders have said the state must look into.
 
 But the NCP may not find it the civic election easy as many of its top leaders have joined the BJP, the latest being former mayor and former city unit president NCP Azam Pansare. 
 
 In November, Bhosari MLA Mahesh Landge, who was an NCP corporator, joined the BJP with five NCP corporators. Chinchwad MLA Laxman Jagtap, who was with the NCP, joined the BJP just before the assembly elections in October 2014.
 
  In the next two weeks, more NCP corporators who support Jagtap and Pansare may join the BJP. 
 
 Jagtap said they were confident of an alliance with   after their meeting on Monday. “A decision is expected next week. The BJP has completed interviews of 470 candidates and is prepared for the civic elections,” he added.
 
 President of Shiv Sena’s Pimpri Chinchwad unit Rahul Kalate said they were positive about an alliance with the BJP. “We have completed the interviews of 275 candidates,” he said. 
 
 The NCP’s city unit president Sanjog Waghere is awaiting for a proposal for a tie-up with the Congress. Last month, seven Congress corporators, including former president Bhausaheb Bhoir, joined the NCP. “So far, we have completed the interviews of 450 candidates for all the 128 seats,” Waghere said.
