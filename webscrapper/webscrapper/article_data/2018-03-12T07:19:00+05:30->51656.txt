LUDHIANA:   MPs   and   tore into the SAD’s Badal family here on Sunday, saying that former deputy CM   Badal and his minister brother-in-law Bikram Singh   would be behind bars soon.

 The two were addressing the crowd at the 2nd job fair organised the state government at Punjab Agricultural University on Sunday. “The usual term is government of people, by the people and for the people. But the previous government being run in Punjab was based on government of the Akalis, by the Akalis and for the Akalis, rather for Badals only,” said Jakhar, the president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee.
 
 Jakhar claimed that illegal buses of Badals would be banned from roads.
 
 He said the previous government had failed to maintain law and order in the state and that peace had returned to Punjab after Congress came to power.
 
 Jakhar said the Congress government had also restored the trust of industrialists, who were troubled due to the single-window system of previous government. He said industrialists shifted from Punjab to other states just because of the malpractices of the previous government.
 
 The   president also alleged that around 1,000 buses were plying on roads in state without any ownership and it was clear that these buses were owned by the Badals. He said they were now going to ban all private buses, and only government buses will ply in the state.
 
 Bittu condemned former Badal and Majithia, saying that Sukhbir and Majithia would be cooling their heels in jail soon.
