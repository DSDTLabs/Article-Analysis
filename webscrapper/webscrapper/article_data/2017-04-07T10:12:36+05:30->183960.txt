NAGPUR: Prime Minister   and student leader   are slated to   on April 14. 

 Kanhaiya, who came to prominence after clashing with ABVP activists in Delhi and is known for his strident anti-right stance, is now expected to steal some limelight from the PM visit. Police will now have to prepare for Kanhaiya's visit in the morning, a few hours before Modi lands up at Deekshabhoomi.
 
 A VVIP security will be in place for the PM, but the police admit they cannot deny Kanhaiya entry to the place on that day. "The place will be also be open for general public who come in large numbers on that day," said a top police officer.
 
 While the minute-to-minute programme of Modi was yet to be announced, there was some speculation on whether he would also visit the RSS headquarters or Reshimbagh. 
 
 At this stage, it looks unlikely as RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and his deputy Bhaiyyaji Joshi will not be in Nagpur on April 14.
 
 If Modi chooses to visit Reshimbagh where RSS founder Hedgewar's memorial stands, he will become the second prime minister to do so. AB Vajpayee was the first PM to do so on August 26, 2000. 
 
 He went to Reshimbagh and had an emotional meeting with Narayanrao Tarte, the ageing pracharak who was instrumental in inducting a young Vajpayee into the Sangh fold in 1937. Incidentally, during that Vajpayee visit to Reshimbagh, the then RSS chief   as well his deputy were not present in the city.
