NEW DELHI: Finance minister  , along with finance ministers of Kerala, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Puducherry, will   President   on Thursday over “unfair” terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission. It’s likely that Sisodia will put forth the consistent demands of the AAP government for a greater share in central taxes.

 
 After AAP came to power, CM Arvind Kejriwal has been maintaining that the Centre is not giving “due shares” in central taxes to the Delhi government. “Finance ministers of non-BJP states feel that the terms of reference are not fair,” said a government official.
