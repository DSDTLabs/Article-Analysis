KOCHI: A resident of Alangad panchayat has written to   complaining that his dog has been given an anti-rabies vaccination past the expiry date. 

 Jacob Santhosh, an industrial consultant who owns a Dachshund, was among the many who had taken their pets for vaccination in mid-February. "According to the new rules, we have to vaccinate our pets and will get licence from the panchayat after the animal husbandry department submits the list," said Jacob.
 
 Jacob said they were asked to collect a receipt later. Along with it a sticker with details of the vaccine was found attached. It showed that the manufacturing year of the vaccine was 2012 and the expiry date 2015. "However, it has been tampered with and made 2018. All the people who had got their pets vaccinated had the same correction on stickers."
 
 When he contacted the department, officials said that the vaccines had not expired, and that the stickers must be old ones. "Then I wrote to the Maneka Gandhi's office as she takes personal interest in these issues."
 
 He got an immediate response. "Not only are the vaccines expired but they are not kept in fridges which makes them totally useless. Give me the phone number of this hospital and I will speak to the director," said the email communication by Maneka Gandhi, Union minister for women and child development. When he mailed back stating that the vaccinations were done by the animal husbandry department, Maneka Gandhi wrote back to state that she has spoken to animal husbandry department secretary   and that the complaint has been forwarded. "I have also spoken to the Additional Chief Secretary  ," her mail said.
 
 Dr Basheer, district animal husbandry officer (DAHO), said that the vaccines are not old nor expired. "We always face shortage of vaccine as we run out of stock. So there is no question of providing old or outdated vaccines. The stickers might be old one. We will enquire into it," he said.
