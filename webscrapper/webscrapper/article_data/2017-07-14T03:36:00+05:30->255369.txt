Panaji: Two years after the civic body approved the solid waste management bylaws, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) is now getting ready to flex its muscles and implement the rules. For starters, CCP has decided to crack the whip on litterers in the capital. The civic body has begun the process of hiring four ex-servicemen who along with municipal and sanitation inspectors will impose fines on those found littering public spaces. Initially, CCP officials will police the municipal market complex and once discipline has been enforced, they will tackle the problems of littering and spitting at other spots across the capital. According to the solid waste management rules drawn up in June 2015, littering and garbage violations will attract fines varying from Rs 200 to Rs 10,000 depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals, residential or commercial establishments littering roads will be fined Rs 200. According to CCPâ€™s rules, fines will also be imposed on those who fail to segregate domestic waste. The highest penalty of Rs 10,000 is reserved for those who fail to segregate hazardous waste.
