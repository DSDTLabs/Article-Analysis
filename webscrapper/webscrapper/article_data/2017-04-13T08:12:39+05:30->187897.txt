NEW DELHI: BJP of Wednesday released a booklet on corruption by AAP and Congress governments in the city. The party alleged that AAP government has left behind the Sheila Diskshit-led Congress government in matters of corruption.

 “In corruption, AAP has picked up from where the Congress had left. Within two years, they (AAP) have outnumbered the corruption cases against Congress. If the Dikshit-government spent Rs 22 crore on advertising, then AAP has spent Rs 97 crore,” said ex- Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay.
 
 BJP attacked the ruling AAP government for continuing with the schemes started by the previous government, which it had once criticised. “The Congress government was involved in a Rs 400 crore water tank scam. AAP had raised the issue while seeking support from the public, but today, they have neither cancelled the contract nor recovered the money,” he said.
 
 The party also blamed AAP for not doing anything for making Delhi safe for women, improving the DTC bus fleet, etc. “Corporations were denied the fund which actually belongs to them by the AAP government. It has also refused to implement the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission recommendations. The corporations doesn’t have money to pay salaries,” added Upadhyay.
