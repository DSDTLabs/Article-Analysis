BENGALURU: JD(S) nominee and  , who had unsuccessfully contested the   polls from JD(S) in 2016, hopes to win this time. He spoke to TOI hours before filing another set of nomination papers on Monday.

 
 
 
 Elections are an integral and necessary part of democracy. Though JD(S) deserved to win one seat going by its original strength of 40 elected MLAs, things have changed after seven MLAs rebelled for various reasons. But we havenâ€™t lost hope. We have been employing various strategies to win back the rebel MLAs and ensure cross-voting by   to win. A clear picture will emerge only after March 15.
 
 
 
 
 As of now, we have the support of 37 MLAs. We have a plan to maketheseven rebelMLAsfall in line. Some Independents have also promised to extend their support. We hope some Congress MLAs who are upset with   for his pre-poll move to split the Lingayat votebank will cross-vote. Some Muslim MLAs are also upset with Congress because of his anti-minority stand.
 
 
 
 
 Certainly. Congress has 60 Rajya Sabha members in the country and of them only five are Muslims. At times, the party has taken support of regional parties to elect non-Muslims.   has a population of about 85 lakh Muslims as per the 2001 census but only one Muslim will represent them from the state. Congress could have ensured the victory of two Muslim candidates if it had some concern for minorities.
