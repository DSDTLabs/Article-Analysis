 The ABK East Siang district unit directed Rina "not to incite communal colour versions, comments in her column, press releases, write-ups." They put up threatening posters on the gates and walls of her residence, further warning her in writing, "Do not forget you are born and brought up in Bilat, East Siang District". The APC is of the view that such behaviour is nothing short of criminal intimidation.
