AHMEDABAD: Bringing relief to those hindered by poorly maintained   associated with  , the state government has announced that from now on, such roads and causeways will be maintained by the  , and not by the  .

 There are hundreds of such structures across the state that need immediate repair, but remain neglected as the irrigation department used to ask the roads and buildings department to repair them, and the roads and buildings department used to refuse, claiming the structures were not under their purview, said officials.
 
 In reply to a question by Prantij MLA Mahendrasinh Bariya, deputy chief minister Nitin Patel said, “The irrigation department has its funds reserved for irrigation works and hence these (roads and causeways) were in disrepair. The decision (giving the responsibility to the roads and buildings department) will pave way for regular maintenance and repairs of these irrigation associated structures and benefit the people.”
 
 Bariya had asked the government to answer why the causeway over the Meshwo river in Talod taluka was not being repaired. He told the government that the causeway was in poor shape and he had submitted several representations to concerned authorities for its repair.
 
 In a written reply to Bariya’s question, the government said that the proposal for repairs had been sent to the roads and buildings department. During discussion on the reply, the deputy CM announced that the government had decided to hand over the responsibility of maintaining such roads and causeways to the roads and buildings department.
 
 “The matter was sent for consideration of the finance department and the same has been approved,” Patel added.
 
 Officials said that until now, the maintenance and repair of the roads and causeways had been suffering as both the irrigation department and the roads and buildings department used to pass the buck to each other.
