Coimbatore: More than 3,000 advocates boycotted the court on Wednesday and also called for an indefinite strike to mark their protest against the circular issued by the Madras high court asking them to attach their identity proof along with the client’s petition before the court.

 As per the order, an advocate has to submit before the court not only his identity proof but also that of the lawyer who attests his client’s petition.
 
 But after the high court stayed the order, the advocates said they would hold a meeting on Thursday to take a call on withdrawing the strike.
 
 “We usually attach a letter with the petitions. In November, the high court issued a circular asking us to attach our photographs and enrolment ID along with the petitions. We opposed it, as we could not carry so many photographs every day. Also this measure won’t solve the issue of quacks,” said a city-based advocate.
 
 Following the stiff opposition from the advocates, the high court issued another order on December 30 asking them to attach their identity proof along with the petition, which should be attested by another lawyer with his/her identity proof. “Asking someone else to attest our petition is itself a burden. Asking to attach his identity proof cannot be accepted,” said an advocate. He also pointed out that this would not help resolve any issue.
 
 “Most quacks use in-house lawyers for their job. Very rarely they come to the courts or represent a client directly. Asking advocates to attach their identity proofs even for attestations is an unnecessary procedure. Instead, technology should be used to curb quacks. We are giving our enrolment number along with the petitions. And that should be used for verification purpose,” said another advocate.
 
 The advocates said other measures should be brought in to tackle the menace of quacks.
