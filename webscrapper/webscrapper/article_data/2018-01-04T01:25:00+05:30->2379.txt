MUMBAI: A tripod-type boring equipment tilted and rested dangerously on an Electrical Multiple Unit (EMU) rake at Currey Road station where the   is constructing a footover bridge (FoB), sparking rumours that the   had crashed on Wednesday. However, the railways downplayed the incident, saying there was no threat to train operations or passenger safety.

 A picture of the tripod’s head resting on the local went viral, leading to buzz of another tragedy. But CR scotched the rumours soon. A senior official said, “The tripod was being transferred and it tilted.” The incident took place at 9.50am and the CSMT-bound train was held back for 7 minutes. The incident took place when the train was stationary.
 
 CR’s divisional manager Sanjay Jain, however, said, the tripod was “deliberately made to rest while being shifted”.
 
 While CR’s divisional manager Sanjay Jain said the tripod did not fall or pose a threat to the train or passengers, a senior railway official said, “The workers could not balance the tripod because of which it tilted.
 
 Neither is the tripod heavy nor did it fall sharply.” However, a source said someone at Currey Road station immediately rushed inside the coach and pulled the alarm chain so that the train did not leave before the tripod was lifted. Another person rushed to the motorman’s cabin to alert him about the incident.
 
 Railway activist  , who tweeted about the incident, said, “The incident is scary as no such work or movement of the construction material should be allowed when train operations are on. I was tipped about the incident by an official who felt that the repercussions would have been severe had railways been carrying out the work instead of the Army.”
 
 The army has been given a January 31 deadline to complete the work on the FOB at Currey Road as well as the ones at   and Elphinstone Road.
