GURUGRAM: Students at five government colleges in Gurgaon have been at the receiving end with ‘extension lecturers’ (guest teachers) refusing to end the ongoing   unless their demand for better remuneration is met.

 On Wednesday, armed with banners and placards, scores of agitating lecturers assembled outside Government Women’s College in Sector 14, shouting slogans against the state education minister to press for an end to the pay-per-lecture practice.
 
 Protesting under the banner of All Haryana Extension Lecturers’ Association that launched a state-level strike on February 13, the lecturers alleged that the government had failed to implement the   and Haryana High Court’s directive (dated May 5, 2016) to pay extension lecturers as per UCG norms. But, even a week after, the state government has not come up with a solution to end the impasse, leaving the students in the lurch. 
 
 “We come to college every day, and see our teachers agitating,” said Neetu Sharma, a BA second year student at Government Women’s College, Sector 14. “With majority of our teachers on strike, only two out of the four scheduled classes took place today (Wednesday).” Deepa, a BA final year student, echoed Neetu. “We come to college, attend one class and then leave. My mother really chides me when I return home early. She thinks I am skipping classes. This has been going on since February 13,” she told TOI.
