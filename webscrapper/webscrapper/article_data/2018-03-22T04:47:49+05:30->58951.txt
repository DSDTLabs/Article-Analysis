MUMBAI: After the arrest of another coaching class staffer in the paper leak case, the   fears that the state government or board will target them for these few rotten apples. “In the past few years, our members have been actively helping the board officials to   and we have been whistleblowers. But because of a few people involved in malpractices, we will all be blamed. The government is planning on crackdowns and policies which will curb our freedom,” said Sachin Karnavat, president,   (MCOA). The association has demanded a thorough inquiry into the school’s or board officials’ involvement in the paper leak. “A coaching class staffer never has direct access to the board papers and there has to be insider involvement. The board cannot wash its hands of this and must plug holes in the exam system,” said Karnavat.
 
 Board officials counter that the network through which the papers circulate consists of members of   only. “Coaching class staff promise students access to papers and tie up with staff at private schools to aid them,” said a senior official who did not wish to be named.
 
 In the latest case, accused Firoz Khan sent the papers to his coaching class staffers and possibly other tutors to circulate to their students. Earlier too, private tutors have been involved in paper leaks. Subhash Borse, in-charge secretary of the state board’s Mumbai division, said they will not indulge in a blame game. “Once we know the source, we will initiate action against the centre. We have also sent reminders to exam conductors to keep a strict vigil for the remaining exams to ensure such amalpractice is not repeated. The board has taken steps to reduce cases of paper leak for HSC and once the exams are over, there will be discussion on how it has to be done for SSC as well,” he said. The SSC exams end on March 24.
