Come winter and we hog on everything that comes our way, from roasted peanuts and gajjaks, to Gaajar ka halwa and fried spinach pakoras. But what often comes our way along with platefuls of delicacies is  . Feasting on these foods, which are often rich in fats and carbohydrates, can lead to a range of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation, acidity, and what not. But here comes   to the rescue.
 
  SwarYog is a breathing-based science. It involves the science of realization of cosmic consciousness through control and manipulation of breath. Here, we look at how SwarYog can be used to heal gastrointestinal problems. SwarYog Expert  , founder of SwarYog Foundation, Mumbai, shares some quick and easy tips to help deal with indigestion.
  
  - According to SwarYog, when you take a nap after having meals, you should first sleep on the left side for some time. Relax this way for ten minutes before rushing for your work. It soothes the digestive system.
  
  - A simple, yet important, practice followed in SwarYog is to sleep on the left side at night. This will help you to prolong the use of right nostril, which results in better digestion and strengthens digestive system in the body.
  
  - Excessive acid generation in the body due to consumption of spicy and oily food also leads to indigestion. SwarYog recommends having such food only after activation of right nostril. Activation of right nostril means closing your left nostril for two to three minutes and breathing only through the right nostril. After that, release the left nostril. Your right nostril shall be activated.
  
  - Intake of sweets and cold/frozen foods, like ice cream, must be done only after activation of left nostril (Follow the same procedure as described above but for left nostril this time). Cooling effect of left nostril helps in harmonising the body fluids without disrupting the body temperature.
  
  - It has been seen that some people, especially children, eat sweets immediately after waking up in the morning. It should be completely avoided as this results in imbalance of natural elemental cycle and makes one prone to stomach disorders.
  
  - This one is an easy Swaryog practice that must be followed daily after having lunch and dinner. Lie down straight on plain surface and breathe as you normally do for eight times. Then, turn around to right side and breathe for sixteen times. Now, turn to left side and breathe for thirty-two times. This helps to make your digestive system stronger and spread out the food particles evenly throughout the system.
  
  - One feels rejuvenated and energetic throughout the day if water is consumed regularly from copper vessel. It helps your body to maintain temperature according to outside weather.
  
  - This is a quick SwarYog tip to get rid of frequent indigestion problem. Start your day everyday with sitting in   for ten minutes. Concentrate on your navel, that is, on your Svadishthana Chakra. Activate right nostril (through the method explained above) and while activating, breath through the same fifteen times. This helps in streamlining the digestive system.
