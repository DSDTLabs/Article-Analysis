THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With less than a week for the CPM state conference to begin, party state secretary   Balakrishnan could heave a big sigh of relief as there is truce between his son   Kodiyeri and his erstwhile business partners in the UAE. Hasan  , who owns   in Dubai, withdrew the financial fraud case filed against Binoy in a Dubai court two days ago. 

 It is learnt that the case was withdrawn after paying a sum though Binoy took a public position that no money was paid and the case was withdrawn as misunderstandings were cleared. Marzooqi, in his complaint to the CPM central leadership, alleged that Binoy owed his company Rs 13 crore. But it is learnt that the figure was inflated and what Binoy owed him was less than Rs 2 crore. On behalf of Binoy, a few of his friends paid the money and settled the account, said sources. 
 
 Most of the CPM leaders in the state and national level came to know about the settling of the case when   aired the report on Thursday. Marzooqi, while speaking to Kairali TV, dismissed allegations against Binoy and said such cases were common in business sphere in Dubai. Earlier, Marzooqi's lawyer had booked a news conference in Thiruvananthapuram Press Club to make charges against Binoy public. 
 
 It is learnt that details of the settlement is kept as a secret by Binoy's family to avoid further controversies. Though Kodiyeri Balakrishnan doesn't face any immediate threat in continuing for another term in the office, the controversy had resulted in strong criticism against him from Bengal unit of the party. There were even demand that the PB should probe the controversy and file a report. 
 
  Meanwhile, cases against Sreejith Vijayan Pillai, son of CPM MLA N Vijayan Pillai are still pending and it is not a secret that Sreejith and Binoy had cooperated in businesses in the UAE.
