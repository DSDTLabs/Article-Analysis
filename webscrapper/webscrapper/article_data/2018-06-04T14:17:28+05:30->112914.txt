Ram Gopal Varma's latest venture ' ', with which he reunited with Nagarjuna after a span of 28 years, turned out to be a box-office dud. However, with reports emerging that the distribution rights of the film were sold at high prices by the makers, the film's producer   clarified that such reports were totally false. In an open letter to the media, Sudheer said that there were a few people who were seeking sadistic pleasure out of bringing down the film and its makers. 

 "All those trade numbers that you are claiming that I’ve sold the film at are all false. Film failed and we are not denying that. Film failed both creatively and financially.. everyone involved with film emotionally, creatively and financially are at loss which can’t be denied. Except the five districts in Andhra Pradesh, which was sold at a mere MG price because of the buyers involvement in the film from earlier, we ourselves released the film in rest of the world," Chandra said in a statement. 
 
 "I know it kind of gives a sadistic pleasure for the people concerned to say whatever they are saying about the economics of the film the way they are right now..... if only any of those were true I would be ok with it. You may attack a film creatively because a film would hurt your senses... but all those finance related false claims should be put to rest," he added. 
 
 Actor Nagarjuna was philosophical after the film's disastrous box-office run and referred to a quote from Winston Churchill to speak his mind.
