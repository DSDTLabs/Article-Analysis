NEW DELHI: The   has summoned   Arvind Kejriwal to appear before it in a matter pertaining to an   seeking information related to his service records as an Indian Revenue Service officer and an NGO he used to run.

 Information commissioner Bimal Julka ordered that Kejriwal will either have to present himself or his representative to argue whether information sought by Ketan Modi of Mumbai from the income tax department should be disclosed or not. Modi sought to know details of Kejriwal as an   officer — salary, paid leaves, absence from service, tax evasion cases detected by him, permission to float an NGO and departmental action against him, if any.
 
 The I-T department told him that the information sought pertained to ‘third party’, that is Kejriwal, which could be disclosed only after taking his consent as per Section 11 of the RTI Act. The section allows a central public information officer to take views of the party about whom the information has been sought through an RTI application.
 
 The I-T department said Kejriwal's views were sought but there was no response from him which means there was no consent for the disclosure of the information sought by Modi. It said some information was not available with the department handling the case.
 
 However, the Act allows disclosure of information even after lack of consent if the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to the interests of such third party.
 
 “No attempt was made to transfer the application to the relevant section/division handling the specific matter and no satisfactory reply could be furnished in this regard,” Julka said in his order.
