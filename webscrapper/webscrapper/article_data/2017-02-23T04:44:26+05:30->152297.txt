VADODARA: Kamal Rana began playing with fire, literally, in 1979 when he made his first fire painting. 

 The city-based artist is now eyeing a   record for making the biggest fire painting in the world, which would be seven foot long and 63 foot wide.
 
 “This is the world’s biggest fire painting and I am sure that it will make it to the Guiness Book of World Records. I began working on this painting 10 months ago and I am still two weeks away from finishing it. Then I will approach the Guinness book officials and apply for the record,” 59-year-old Rana told TOI.
 
 An artist since childhood, Rana was fascinated with flames when he used to sit with his friends around bonfire. 
 
 “I used to observe the flames dancing to the tunes of the wind, their pattern and smoke clouds. That’s when the idea of making fire paintings struck me. I began using different chemicals and making special canvass for these unique works,” Rana, who is an alumnus of the Faculty of Fine Arts, M S University said. He has already made it to the   for making biggest fire painting in the past. 
 
 The current painting is themed on cricket as Rana is fond of the sport. “I have picked up typical styles of 30 cricketers from different countries and made fire paintings of each of them. It wasn’t easy to make this painting as it took me about three months to find a suitable canvass and then coat it with different chemicals to make it fit for fire painting. I also collected photographs of the cricketers I had to paint,” Rana said. 
 
 He wants this painting to be displayed at some cricket stadium. “I am in talks for installing it at a stadium in Australia but I want it to be kept at Motera Stadium in  . I hope something works out,” Rana added.
