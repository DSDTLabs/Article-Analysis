PUNE: This week is turning out to be an extremely hectic one for   as he has to write his SSC papers for two days and undergo dialysis for two more days.

 Undeterred by the agony of going through dialysis for about three years now, the 16-year-old boy from Indapur in Solapur district, about 140km from Pune, is determined to successfully complete the Secondary School Certificate (SSC, std X) examinations —the first barrier to overcome before he can become a government officer one day. 
 
 A student of   at Bavda in Indapur, Pratik has another immediate challenge in life — to get his kidneys transplanted after the examinations at a hospital in Pune. “He (Pratik) sat through the entire duration of the papers so far and has done well. He is determined to do well in the exam, as he wants to become an officer,” said Hanumant, Pratik’s father. 
 
 The boy has been on dialysis for over three years now, as his family could not bear the expenses of a kidney transplant. He was taken to a hospital when he was in std VII. But much to his parents’ shock, doctors there said both his kidneys had failed. 
 
 “Our family’s financial background is modest. My wife and I take home tuitions for children in the neigbourhood. Pratik has to undergo two surgeries and the treatment would cost around Rs 12 lakh. He has always been a bright child, scoring around 90% in examinations before his illness was detected,” Hanumant said.
