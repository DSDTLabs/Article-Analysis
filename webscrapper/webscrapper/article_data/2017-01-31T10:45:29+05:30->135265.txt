GAYA: Several hundred monks and other Buddha followers on Monday morning walked the 6km Buddha Marg between Prak Bodhi, the pre- enlightenment site located on the Dhungeshwari hill, and Vajrasan, the seat of enlightenment on the   premises. 

 The walk, christened  , was organised on the eve of  , the three-day cultural extravaganza beginning Wednesday.
 
 Dhungeshwari is regarded as the second most important Buddha site as pre-enlightenment Buddha spent six long years in meditation before adopting Madhyam Marg or the middle path. In Buddhist literature, Dhungeshwari is referred to as Prak Bodhi (pre-enlightenment).
 
 Buddhist researcher and Magadh University’s Ancient Indian and   former head late P C Roy has in his works attributed the Madhyam Marg story to a folk song sung by local village women which meant that do not tighten ‘veena’ (musical instrument) strings so much that it gets snapped and do not loosen it so much that no music comes out of it.
 
 The folk song impressed Buddha so much that he broke his fast and moved forward. All his five disciples deserted Buddha, labelling him ‘dhongi’ (pretender). Dhungeshwari owes its nomenclature to the disciple's outburst, concluded the researcher.
