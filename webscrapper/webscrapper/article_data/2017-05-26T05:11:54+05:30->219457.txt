MUMBAI: When  , a play directed by  , opened to a full house in the compact G5A recently, it took the audience on a trip from India to Europe along with the star of the play: an elephant. Previously staged in Marathi, Takalkar has reworked his play into a Hindi one for Aadyam this year. 

 Based on the Nobel-winning Portuguese author Jose de Sousa Saramago's ' ', it tells the tale of how an elephant from India was taken to Europe in 1551 where no one had seen an elephant before. The venue-G5A's Black Box, a stage that offers creative freedom to the director, enhanced the audience's experience of being part of elephant's journey, the challenges it faces and the beautiful relationship it shares with its mahout, Subhro. "We've designed a 360-degree black box layout and the audiences were delighted to have this additional vantage point," says Takalkar, overwhelmed by the rave reviews his play has received so far.
 
 While Saramago's prose-rich writing worked for the novel, Takalkar has effectively used language, lighting and sound to bring to life this emotional travelogue on stage. Different characters speak different languages and dialects and the entire supporting cast speaks an invented new language-a mix of gibberish tempered with Spanish, which adds to the comedy.
 
 "Gajab Kahani was an engaging play with consistently wonderful performances from every member of the cast," says Kumar Mangalam Birla of the  , the organisation behind Aadyam. "It was hilarious and poignant, satirical and thought-provoking all at once," he adds.
 
  (Four more shows of Gajab Kahani will be staged on May 27 and 28 at the G5A)
