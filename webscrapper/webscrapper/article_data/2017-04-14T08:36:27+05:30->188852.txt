AMRITSAR: The SGPC has taken up the issue of poor preservation and disrespect of the historical handwritten ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib reportedly lying in   and  , Lahore with the Pakistan government. A two-member team comprising a manager of an SGPC-run gurdwara and a supervisor has submitted their report after visiting Lahore Central Museum, Punjab Public Library, and Dyal Singh Library.

 According to the report, the two-member team didn’t find any Sikh religion or history related book or other similar material in Lahore Central Library but the Punjab Public Library has a few very old handwritten as well as printed ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib. Despite the library administration writing to the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) and   (PSGPC) for the preservation of these as per ‘maryada’ (code of religious conduct), they did not receive any reply from both, says the report. However, the management of Dyal Singh Library has outrightly denied having any ‘saroop’ of Guru Granth Sahib or any other Sikh historical books.
 
 “Yes, we have received the report but we didn’t send them. They had gone on their own and upon return they submitted a report,” said SGPC chief secretary Harcharan Singh while talking to TOI on Thursday. He said the SGPC had taken up the issue with the Pakistan government as well as with the PSGPC. However, sources stated that there were many rare and handwritten ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib in possession of Dyal Singh Library as well as Lahore Central Museum but both ETPB and PSGPC preferred to turn a blind eye towards the issue.
 
 Member of Pakistan Punjab provincial assembly Ramesh Singh Arora said there were ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib with the Lahore museum and fort and Bahawalpur museum. He said that he had taken up the issue in the assembly and with the minister concerned, who in his reply had informed about the formation of a committee for handing over the ‘saroops’ to the PSGPC.
