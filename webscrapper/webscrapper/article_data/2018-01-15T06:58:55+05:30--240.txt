BENGALURU: A marathon meeting of Dalit leaders to discuss the implementation of the Justice A J   Commission report on internal reservation among Scheduled Castes remained inconclusive, forcing the panel to empower CM Siddaramaiah to take the final call on the issue.

 "The CM will decide on implementing the commission report in consultation with legal experts," social welfare minister A H   said, after a meeting of Dalit leaders of the ruling party on Sunday. "The government will take all communities into confidence," he added. The Justice A J Sadashiva Commission, which looked into methods of equitable distribution of reservation facilities among SCs, had submitted the report in June 2012 to then chief minister  , while reclassifying all the 101 castes into four groups. It had also asked the government to take up the matter with the Centre, as providing of internal reservation within the 15% quota provided to SCs required amendments to the law. Though a section of Dalits demanded early implementation of the report, some opposed it, saying injustice has been done to them.
 
  At the meeting, a war of words ensued between   chief   and former   minister  , as they represent different groups among the SCs.
