LUCKNOW: Various teachers' associations in Uttar Pradesh have written to deputy chief minister   demanding a judicial probe in a controversy over alleged 'spiking of marks' in UP board class X and XII results which were declared on April 29 by the UP Secondary Education board. 

 In a letter to Sharma, who is also the secondary education minister, state president of Madhyamik Vittavihin Shikshak Mahasabha, Umesh Dwivedi has said, "The huge difference of marks in award-sheets carrying raw marks awarded by examiners, and final mark-sheets indicates to a bigger marks scam. The marks have been increased, and decreased arbitrarily, putting students' future at stake."
