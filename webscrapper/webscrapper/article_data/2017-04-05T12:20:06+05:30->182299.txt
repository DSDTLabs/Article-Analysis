MANSA: SAD chief   said on Tuesday that instead of fulfilling its poll promises, the newly-formed Congress government had started doing the opposite as the   power tariff hike in the state showed.

 Addressing party workers on Tuesday at Mansa, Badal said it was unfortunate that reports of   impacting all sections of the society had started to come out as among the first decisions of the new government. He said, “It was condemnable that the new government had taken such an anti-people step within a fortnight of attaining power. Congress had announced that it would reduce power tariffs, especially those of domestic consumers, if it returns to power.”
 
 Stating that people would soon learn real intentions of the Congress leaders, the former deputy CM said the party seemed to have reneged on all promises made to the people of the Punjab. “The Congress promised to waive loans of farmers, increase social welfare pensions and give unemployment allowance and smartphones to youth. No action has been taken to fulfil even a single one of these promises. However, an anti-people decision to hike power tariff has been taken,” he said.
 
 Akali Dal’s Rajya Sabha MP Balwinder Singh Bhunder said the new government should ensure justice to all and not allow its party workers to indulge in political vendetta. SAD’s Mansa constituency candidate   urged the Akali Dal chief to take action against opportunist elements who worked against them in the assembly elections.
