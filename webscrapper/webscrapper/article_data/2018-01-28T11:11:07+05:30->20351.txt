MANGALURU: Akhil Bharath Hindu   on Saturday announced its plans to field candidates in 150 assembly constituencies in   for the forthcoming assembly elections. 

 The Mahasabha, a registered but not recognized political party, will strive to take on the might of two national parties in   and the   and considers Congress as its main political opponent, said N  , state president of the Mahasabha.
 
 Addressing reporters on Saturday, Subramanya Raju said the Mahasabha does not consider BJP as its ideological or political ally in that the BJP has long abandoned its Hindutva ideology. “We are in the process of finalizing our list of candidates and announce the first list by February-end,” he said, adding that it has become imperative to enter active politics to promote the cause of Hindutva given that the BJP is no longer at it.
 
 Criticising the Congress government in the state, Subramanya Raju said the state government is steeped in corruption and in pursuing ‘anti-Hindu’ policies. The opposition BJP is obviously blind to these happenings across Karnataka, he said, adding that the Mahasabha is now compelled to politically fight this ‘misfortune’ of the Hindus for having reposed faith in the saffron outfit. “We will give BJP a fitting reply to its policies in the elections,” he noted.
 
 Move by the Congress government to withdraw cases against SDPI, PFI cadre has resulted in a bloodbath of Hindus in the state. To add to this, the state government is now considering to withdraw cases registered against minorities involved in communal clashes and has sought opinion of police, he said, adding this move smacks of political appeasement of a particular section of society. “We condemn this move of the government,” he added.
