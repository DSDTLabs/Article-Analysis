KOLKATA: Jadavdpur University’s vice-chancellor —   — lodged an FIR with the   cybercell department claiming someone has created a fake email ID in his name and has been using it to seek “help”

 
 Das first learnt about this when a fellow received an email — purportedly from his Hotmail address — seeking professional help. “The professor found it highly suspicious that an academician as reputed as Das would seek such help. So he immediately contacted Das who assured him that he had no such email address,” said an investigating officer.
 
 
  
 
 Over the next few days, Das kept receiving calls from several people who told him that they, too, received such a spam email. As Das is a   resident, he decided to approach the Bidhannagar police for help. “We have registered a case in this regard and initiated an investigation,” said Amit Javalgi, DC (Headquarters). Das could not be reached over phone.
 
 Police sources said the contents of the email show that the accused is in possession of certain details about Das which no outsider can easily have access to. “It appears that either some of his details were hacked or someone who has known him for some time is behind the crime,” said an investigating officer.
 
 The investigating team said there is usually a pattern to such frauds. “We have found that some of the email IDs had been created from a particular computer. These address often bear resemblance to the original one used by their victims,” said an investigator.
 
 The FIR lodged in this case includes charges of forgery and relevant sections under the IT Act.
