PUNE: Several senior officials of the   ( ) seem to be oblivious to the   of setting up 17   (RO) water treatment plants in the city.

 The PMC, in its budget, had mentioned installing solar-powered plants in the city. However, the officials in question do not see the need for such plants. Around Rs Rs 4.08 crore has been set aside to set up the plants.
 
 “To provide clean drinking water for citizens visiting PMC gardens, RO water treatment plants will be installed in 17 gardens,” the budget read.
 
 Senior officials do not see the need for RO plants in the city. “The last time that PMC had invested money in such plants, it was given to the zilla parishad to compensate for the release of untreated sewage into the rivers. However, I have neither been in any discussion regarding these for the current budget, nor do I see the need for RO plants in a city like Pune,” said a senior official.
 
 According to superintendent of the PMC gardens department,  , the gardens under PMC are not supplied by the city’s water lines. They have bores installed so as not to hamper water supply to citizens. “Since the 2016-17 budget of the body, RO plants have been installed in various gardens. This year too, we will be installing more,” he said.
