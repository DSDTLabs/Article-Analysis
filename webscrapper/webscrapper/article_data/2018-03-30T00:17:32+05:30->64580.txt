Trichy: A remand prisoner who was arrested for kidnapping a girl escaped from the jail in Kulithalai in Karur district on Wednesday. Following the incident, a prison guard was placed under suspension on Thursday. 

 Durairaj, 25, from Poolampatti in Kadavur Taluk in Karur, made the escape when he was assigned to clear the garbage outside the sub-jail at 6.45am on Wednesday. The prisoner managed to shove Clement Joseph, 58, the prison guard, and escape. Joseph was due for superannuation in two days on March 31. 
 
 As soon as the news reached higher officials of the prison department, they conducted a search to nab him. The search failed to nab him and a complaint was filed at the Kulithalai police station by sub-jail superintendent Kandhasamy on Wednesday night. A case was registered by the Kulithalai police. 
 
 Trichy central prison superintendent Nikila Nagendran visited the prison and inquired with Clement Joseph and put him on suspension.
 
 Prison officials said that there were six prisoners lodged in the sub-jail on Wednesday. The prison guard had escorted Durairaj outside to collect the garbage to keep the prison campus clean. According to the complaint by the prison superintendent, the accused pushed the guard down and escaped. 
 
 Durairaj was one of the four accused arrested for abducting a 10-year-old girl, his relative, to marry her, on February 5 by the Thogaimalai police. 
 
 Except for Durairaj, the rest were released on bail a few days back. A prison official said that Durairaj had been issued bail but it was kept on hold for want of two sureties.
