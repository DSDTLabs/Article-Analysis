 “Today many people across the world refer to Bapu’s work and what he had to say on sustainability. The 150 year anniversary celebrations will largely focus on taking Bapu’s message across the country and the world,” Sarabhai said.
 
 Gujarat Vidyapeeth vice-chancellor Anamik Gandhi gave the information that work on the national committee and planning has already started. “Institutions are discussing ways of propagating Bapu’s constructive programmes, and addressing wider issues of social dichotomies that pose a serious threat to humankind,” the VC said.
