Nagpur: In a bid to encourage science enthusiasts,   Center (RSC) and Planetarium launched a new planetarium show ‘From Earth to Universe’ on Friday. SVC Kameshwar Rao, general manager, Regional Remote Sensing Centre, Nagpur was the chief guest on the occasion.

 More than 100 students along with some officials attended the first show which was half an hour long. It depicted the formation of universe, galaxies, planets and subsequently life.
 
 N Ramdas Iyer, project coordinator and head of Raman Science Centre, said, “Astronomy was one of the first principles of science to come into existence. The early man were baffled by the beauty of the stars and ignited by curiosity, worked hard to learn more about the universe and the reason for its existence. All the other subjects physics, chemistry, biology, maths and others came subsequently, aiming to aid astronomy in its voyage of new discoveries.”
 
 Highlighting the application of astronomy in real life, Iyer, said, “Astronomy aids in finding direction, predicting time and weather. The early men and scientists of today’s generation use astrophysics for their survival, which never fails to amaze.”
 
 Rao said, “For the young minds, planetariums are like caves of gold, the only difference is that gold is in the form of knowledgeVisits and shows in the planetariums have been the source of inspiration for numerous scientists. It has also been stated by numerous studies that planetarium increases concentration and focusing skills and also enhances the learning ability of an individual.”
