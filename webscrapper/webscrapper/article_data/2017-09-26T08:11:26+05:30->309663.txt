HYDERABAD: A self-styled godman was charged with sexual abuse after he allegedly tried to rape  . While the incident took place 10 days ago, the issue came to light on Monday after the local Nacharam police admitted a probe in the case.

 Cops said a case has been booked against baba Sriram Sharma under IPC 354 (Assault or criminal force with intent to outrage her modesty) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 The 45-year-old victim came across the accused in Kanakadurga temple, Basheerbagh, a few weeks back. During their meeting, the woman informed the baba that her family was in deep financial crisis and in response, the baba said a puja had to be performed at her house.
 
 “On September 14, it was decided that puja would be performed at the woman's residence. The victim was informed by Sriram that her husband and children should not be present while the puja was being performed. Accordingly , family members left the house before the baba arrived,'' Nacharam sub-inspector Sudhir said.
 
 During the puja, the accused allegedly attempted to rape the victim, police said.“The victim resisted the accused and raised a hue and cry .The accused fled out of fear and later victim approached the police,'' an official said.
 
 Police said they are investigating the matter and action will be initiated. The victim's family owns a bar-cumrestaurant. Sriram, 40, has been at television studios giving sermons on spirituality and it is learnt that he has contacts with influential politicians.
