 Speaking to TOI over telephone hours after his election on Monday, Kambara was in his elements. Excerpts from the interview. 
 
 
 
 The first priority is to revitalize state languages, which is the need of the hour as regional languages are facing threat in a globalized world. This apart, we need to build harmony among regional languages which is necessary to protect them. Adoption of technology to strengthen state languages is also a priority.
 
 
 
 
 Yes, that’s the real challenge. We need to explore ways and means as to how we can make regional languages our livelihood languages. If our children can be employable after learning our own languages, then they need not learn a foreign language to earn a livelihood. 
 
 
 
 
 Politics is entwined with the issue that you are raising. Threat to freedom of expression is, in fact, a serious problem. We need to find a way out without becoming victims of polarization of everything, including literature, which we are seeing now.
