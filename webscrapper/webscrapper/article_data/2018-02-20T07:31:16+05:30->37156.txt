BENGALURU: The going was good for  , now 28, son of a farmer from  , till he noticed some abnormal movement in his neck for the first time when he was 19: it tilted excessively backward. 

 While the movement was initially intermittent, it gradually became so severe that he could hardly sit, stand or walk without someone physically supporting his head to prevent its backward tilt.
 
 Diagnosed with a complex movement disorder,   and  , with its roots in areas in the brain concerning motor functions, Virupaksha underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery three years ago in a city hospital.   involves putting a specialized pacemaker in the chest and connecting it to the brain. The pacemaker enables the distorted part of the brain to function normally.
 
  However, not much improvement was noticed and Virupaksha was recommended a battery replacement of the pacemaker, which his family couldn't afford. He was brought to Jain Institute of Movement Disorders and Stereotactic Neurosurgery at Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital, where a team of surgeons conducted their second successful live brain surgery on him on October 14, 2017.
