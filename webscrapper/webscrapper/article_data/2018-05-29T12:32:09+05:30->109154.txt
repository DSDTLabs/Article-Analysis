CHARMINAR:  , a magnificent and an evocative piece of   in the city, is set to get a facelift before monsoon this year. The palace used to be the official residence of the Nizams while they ruled Hyderabad.

 
 Efforts are being made to conserve the heritage structure in a phased manner by taking the help of traditional craftsmen and using traditional techniques.
 
 
  
 
 Officials say while there are a range of elements in the building that need to be conserved to maintain the integrity of the historic structure, painting works and small structural repairs are being carried out in the first phase.
 
 “Over the years, the painting and stucco work of the structure has been wearing off constantly due to rain, pollution and other factors. So, we have decided to take up painting and repairs of stucco work on the exterior walls of the palace,” said G Kishan Rao, director of the palace.
 
 “The reason we took up painting works in the first phase is because it will be difficult to do it once monsoon commences. Therefore, we are trying to complete the first phase by June 15,” he said, adding that the budget for the ongoing painting and structural repairs is about Rs 38 lakh to Rs 40 lakh.
 
 Besides structural repairs and stabilization, the restoration of several architectural features will also be carried out. These include granite arches, decorative work in lime plaster and terracotta balusters, officials said.
