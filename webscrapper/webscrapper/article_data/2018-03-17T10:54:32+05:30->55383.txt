Giving a sneak peek into the societal fabric of the Mughal era, popular theatre personality,   delighted city’s theatre enthusiasts with her social-satirical play,   at   on Thursday. Based on renowned Urdu writer, Ismat Chughtai’s famous story by the same name, Ratna brought to life its two characters — Gori Bi, a young bride, and her old husband, Kaale Mian, both Mughal descendants, in her inimitable style.

 Set in the backdrop of the fall of the Mughal Empire, the play highlighted the thought-provoking issue of how the burden of patriarchal practices and male ego subjugated women during the time. With a tinge of humour and social sarcasm, the play unravelled how his ego doesn’t allow Kaale Mian to lift the veil of his young wife and how it leads to the collapse of their marriage. It showed how he refused to lift Gori Bi’s ghoonghat even on his death bed and passes away without even seeing her face. Ratna received a standing ovation from nearly 200-odd people who gathered at the venue to watch the performance.
 
 Speaking to the audience after the play, Ratna stressed that India is a treasure trove of stories and it’s high time we promote local theatre in 
 vernacular languages. “It has been a great experience performing in Hyderabad. India is the only place in the world where theatre lacks a formal structure because here, a theatre artiste needs to be multitasker; doing everything by themselves. Theatre has the potential to appeal to people’s sensibilities even in this digital era and all it needs is our support,” she signed off.
