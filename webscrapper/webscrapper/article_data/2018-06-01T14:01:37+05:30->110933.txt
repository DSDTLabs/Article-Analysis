MANGALURU:   based in New Mangalore, on Wednesday, helped   fishermen on board fishing boat St Anthony that was facing distress 92 nautical miles from Kochi, due to engine failure. The message received from the   Coordination Centre from Mumbai around 10.30am on May 30, that 9 crew on board the boat are in distress, was relayed to ICGS Vikram, that was out on patrol, and diverted to the area.

 
 The ship reached the position of the distressed fishing boat at 5.15pm and its technical team along with tools and medical aid, embarked on board the fishing boat to rectify the defect. “Since the engine defect could not be rectified at sea, the ship towed the distressed fishing boat to Kochi,” DIG S S Dasila, commander, Coast Guard Karnataka, said.
 
 “After towing the boat for around 57 nautical miles, the Coast Guard handed over the boat to another fishing boat, ‘Jasmine’, at 7.45am on May 31, some 35 nautical miles from Kochi, for onward passage to Kochi port. Thereafter, the ship resumed patrol in the designated area,” Dasila said.
