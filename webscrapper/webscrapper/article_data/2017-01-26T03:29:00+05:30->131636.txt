PANAJI: With Republic Day on a Thursday, the state is witnessing a surge in tourists. The fact is being reflected in the rise in air fares as well as hotel room rates, that have reached close to 95% occupancy. 

 A closer look at hotel prices on various web portals has indicated that most hotels in Goa are sold out, and many are left with few rooms. A price comparison of rooms during the long weekend with the next week shows a huge rise, with some hotels showing a fluctuation of a 95% hike in prices. 
 
 Affirming that they are also expecting a surge in demand for hotel rooms, general manager of a 5-star hotel in South Goa, Siddharth Savkur, said the peak demand is for Saturday and Sunday. 
 
 “The current occupancy stands at 90%. January 26 being a dry day is a factor that is keeping people from arriving in the state,” Savkur said.
 
 Similar observations were made by the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, Savio Messias. “Long weekends are traditionally a good business period for hoteliers. The effects of demonetization which adversely affected business have also gone away now,” Messias said, adding that not all hotel owners have increased their rates and some are still offering discounts. 
 
 Travellers, who have made last-minute weekend plans in Goa, will be paying through their noses to fly back home. Delhites will have to pay three times the regular fare on January 29 to return home.
 
 Bus fares too will provide no cheap alternative, priced between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 for Goa to Mumbai, Goa to Bengaluru, Goa to Pune and Goa to Hyderabad routes. The regular fare for an air conditioned bus on these routes costs around Rs 900 to Rs 1,000.
