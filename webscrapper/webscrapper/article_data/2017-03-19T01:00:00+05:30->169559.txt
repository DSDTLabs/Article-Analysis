PATNA: People can expect a slight respite from the surging mercury over the next couple of days as Patna Meteorological Centre has forecast light showers and thunder in Patna and several other places in Bihar till Monday.

 Meteorologists said trace rainfall (less than 0.1mm) was reported on Saturday at some places in the state, including Bhagalpur and Gaya. Thundering too occurred at Bhagalpur. Weathermen attributed the variation in   conditions to a trough line stretching from Gangetic West Bengal to Jharkhand and Odisha.
 
 Anand Shankar, a scientist at Patna Meteorological Centre, claimed that the trough has led to formation of a cyclonic circulation in the region. “The cyclonic circulation is leading to formation of convective clouds at isolated places, which is leading to light showers and thunder. The system is not very strong, but there is possibility of trace to light rainfall at a few isolated places,” the scientist added.
 
 He said the forecast of formation of convective clouds along with thunder activities at isolated places would be effective for two days ending Monday.
 
 The all-India weather bulletin issued from the headquarters of India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday too predicted isolated showers in Bihar on Sunday and Monday.
 
 “The maximum temperature is likely to remain unchanged at most places in Bihar over the next three days and it would hover around 31-32 degrees C. The temperature would gradually start surging thereafter,” Shankar added.
 
 He claimed that summer conditions are expected to set in the state in another 12 days, when the maximum temperature would be recorded at 35 degrees C or above. Weathermen have hinted at severe and lengthy summer season ahead. IMD’s long range forecast based on climate models has suggested that the actual temperature in the month of March may be 0.8 degrees C higher than the normal and 1.25 degrees C above the respective normal in April across the country.
