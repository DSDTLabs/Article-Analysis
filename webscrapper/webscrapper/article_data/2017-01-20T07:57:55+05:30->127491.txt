LUCKNOW: With the chief secretary fixing the responsibility on senior officers, government departments will have to shun using   in the official fleet.

 A controlling officer would earn an adverse entry if his subordinates were found using the horn. The idea is to put its own house in order before restricting the use of pressure horns in vehicles. The   (GO) issued by the chief secretary to the principal secretaries and heads of the department says that if the persondriver of the govern ment department uses a pressure horn or if it is used in government vehicles, it does not send out a good message. â€œIf the vehicles of government officers continue to use pressure horns, will it be relevant to take action against commoners using the horn?" says the GO.
 
 The principal secretaries and HoDs should, therefore, order for removal of pressure horns from the fleet of their department. A fine of Rs 1,000 will be imposed on the first offence and Rs 2,000 on subsequent offences.
 
 The use of pressure horns in   in government fleet is a cause of public inconvenience. Meanwhile, a separate GO on wearing seat belts makes it mandatory for drivers of government vehicles to wear a seat belt while driving.
 
 The person sitting on the front seat beside the driver will also have to wear a seat belt. In case of a violation, it will again be the controlling officer who would earn an adverse entry.
