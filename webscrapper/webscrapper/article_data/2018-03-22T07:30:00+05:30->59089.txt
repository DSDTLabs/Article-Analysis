Chandigarh: Mosquitoes that passed   fever to a lot of people last year have stung many families again in Sector 22, as the residents remain dissatisfied with the maintenance of their parks and back lanes.

 During a visit to the sector, the TOI team found that its main parks had pools of stagnant water around the treated-water supply line. Even the back lanes had a lot of puddles. Sector-22 resident welfare association (RWA) president Rajender Mohan Kashyap reported the problem of stranded water in all major green belts of the area. “These soggy grounds have become the biggest breeding grounds of mosquito. Last year, when dengue fever spread in the city, it affected 900 people in the area and even claimed a life,” Kashyap said. “The civic authorities, however, didn’t do much about it.”
 
 Sector-22 woman Sukhwinder Kaur said the residents had even reported the outbreak of dengue fever and called a fogging team over with the kerosene oil and chemical spray, “which has been ineffectual”. “On my street, each house has at least one resident down with dengue fever again but the authorities concerned have not responded,” she said. Her house number is 3254.
 
 In the dock
 
 Dengue fever is not because of tertiary treated water that is used to irrigate the parks. It is because of the residents who throw water in the back lanes after watering their lawns. It is in this water that mosquito breeds. I will start a cleanliness drive in the back lanes in 10 to 15 days and intensify it if the problem persists
