Bestselling mytho-fiction author   is currently working on the   series, in which the god Apollo has been stripped of his powers and banished from the heavans. He has to prove himself and in a series of dangerous adventures in which he has to right the wrongs he was blamed for.

 The third book in the series, 
  is all set to release and will feature characters from his other series as well. The saytr from the first series,   will be guiding Apollo and his human master Meg though the burning maze.
 
 In the promotional videos of the series, the other favourite saytr, Coach Hedge comes in to help the reader/viewer get fit enough to survive the burning maze. In what looks like a format of a dance exercise video, the saytr and two others in the background hop about as they teach 'light warm ups' for before the reader/viewer enters, or how to squat properly to avoid attacks from fire breathing dragons and how to "stop, drop and pray", in case one catches fire. 
 
  has been releasing funny promotional videos to tease Riordan's upcoming books of the entire series, which complements the humour found in the book.
 
 
  will release on May 1, 2018.
