BATHINDA: The   cabinet decision to provide direct benefit transfer of electricity to farmers by paying subsidy in cash after metering tube wells as a pilot project has not gone down well with Punjab farmers. The farmers burnt state government effigies at various places on Thursday to protest against the move.

 The cabinet had given its nod to the pilot project on providing direct benefit transfer of electricity to 990 farmers by paying subsidy in cash and metering the power at tubewells. The cash-starved state government is spending Rs 6,000 crore to provide free power to the farm sector.
 
 “It is a ploy of the state government to snatch fee-power facility from the farm sector. The state though is claiming that it is a pilot project which will be started with 990 farmers but in few months it may be taken to the whole of the state and ultimately power will be charged. We will not allow this to happen”, said farm organization BKU Ekta Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri.
 
 “The farmers are getting free power for the last many years. Amarinder had stopped free power facility during his previous tenure in the government. We will never tolerate it and will make every possible sacrifice if government tried to discontinue the facility”, said farm organisation BKU Dakonda state president Buta Singh Burjgill.
 
 The state government has already deceived famers by not waiving the farm loans as promised before elections and now coming up with another anti-farmer move has unmasked its anti-farmer face, alleged Kokri.
 
 Former SAD minister   said the   had given free electricity to farm sector in its 10 year rule. The   has tried to discontinue it in the first year of its government. The SAD will oppose it.
