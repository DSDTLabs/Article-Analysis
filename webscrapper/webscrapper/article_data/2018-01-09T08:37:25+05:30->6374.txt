 Arora was produced in a Kapurthala court and remanded to vigilance bureau custody for four days. The case has been registered under Sections 409,120-B of the IPC and 13(1)(d), 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
 
  
  Arora, who is closely linked with the RSS and has also worked for the organisation, was appointed vice-chancellor by the SAD-BJP government in 2009 for a three-year tenure and was then given an extension for another three years. His tenure was extended by a few weeks and he continued on the post till January 2016.
 
 The university, which was set up during the SAD-BJP regime of 1997-02 has remained mired in controversies for all the wrong reasons since its inception. Arora was the second vice-chancellor of the PTU. Its first vice-chancellor, Dr H S Gurm, was arrested by the vigilance bureau during Captain  's first government in 2002-07.
 
 Punjab BJP spokesperson  , reacting to the development, said Arora's arrest smacked of political vendetta.
 
 Chandigarh-based BJP leader  , son of the late BJP leader   has also been arraigned as an accused in the case. Former BJP minister  's daughter Geetika Sood, who was appointed as a legal officer has also been made an accused in the case.
 
 "She had not attached any document with her application which could prove her experience of having worked in office/university academic and legal matters as a legal practitioner. According to the facts, this appointment was made without having the requisite experience certificate," a bureau spokesperson said.
