NEW DELHI: Three terrorists of Pakistan-based   (JeM) outfit were killed on Saturday in a gunfight with the security forces in   area Jammu and Kashmir's   district, a police official said.

 While two of the terrorists were killed this morning, another took shelter inside a cave and was finally killed after several hours of gunbattle in Tral, about 36 kms from here, the official said.
 
 He said bodies of all the three militants and their weapons were recovered from the scene of the gunbattle which started early this morning when security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation after receiving an information about presence of terrorists there.
 
 
 
 
 He said though the identity of the deceased terrorists was being ascertained, they belonged to JeM outfit.
 
 "The killing of the terrorists is a major setback for the outfit which is trying to revive its activities in the valley," the official said.
 
 He said security forces faced stone-pelting during the operation but exercised maximum restrain while dealing with it.
 
 Some people indulged in stone-pelting and tried to march towards the encounter scene to help the terrorists escape but were chased away by the security forces, the official said, adding there was no report of any casualty among the civilians.
 
 On July 9, a CRPF jawan was injured when terrorists hurled a grenade inside a security forces' camp in Tral's Aribal town.
