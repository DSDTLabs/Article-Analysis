 and   are feeling butterflies in their stomach. Understandably so, since this Friday, with Shaad Ali’s 'OK Jaanu', they have to live up to the experience 'O  ' offered two years ago. The actors admit that they agreed to work on the remake of the Tamil hit only after they were shown the film.

 “We have watched the film just once. And our film is not very different from Mani sir’s ( ). We’ve barely made some changes,” says Shraddha, who is a fan of romantic films like 'The Notebook' that play beautifully on the lead pair’s chemistry. Aditya, who is a fan of 'The Fault In Our Stars' and ' ', is quick to add, “We stuck to the screenplay because it worked for the audience. There’s no need to fix something that’s not broken. I fell in love with the lead pair’s performances in the original. Having said that, we’ve brought in our own personalities to the characters because we didn’t want to ape anyone.” 
 
 Aren’t they afraid of the comparisons that will be drawn between the two versions? While Shraddha seems a tad nervous, Aditya appears confident. “It’s unavoidable. We’ve signed up for the pressure because the idea and the relevance of a story which is so modern, yet so Indian at heart, connected with us. That’s why we could plunge into a remake, something we’ve not done before,” ends Aditya.
