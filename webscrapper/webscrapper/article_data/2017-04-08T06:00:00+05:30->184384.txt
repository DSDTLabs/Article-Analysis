KOLKATA/SHIMLA: Two days of unseasonal snow and rain in   Pradesh have left around 70 tourists — including 34 women and 11 children — from   stranded at Chitkul, the last Indian village near China border in Kinnaur district, as road connectivity has been disrupted due to heavy snowfall and sliding glaciers. The stranded tourists are likely to be evacuated on Saturday.

 Chitkul is located some 250km from Shimla, at an altitude of around 11,320 feet. It is the highest village of Baspa valley in Kinnaur. At present, the area is covered under 3-4 feet snow.
 
 “We reached here on April 4th. It’s snowing since then. We were carring dry food with us. But our stock is depleting fast. There is no way we can replenish our stock,” said Sukanto Sikdar, one of the stranded tourists. 
 
 Another tourist, 86-year-old Pushpo Sikdar, has started suffering from breathing trouble. Not only Sikdar, some others have also complained of health problems. 
 
 Kinnaur deputy commissioner (DC)   said that around five members of the group had complained of fever, headache and other health issues and a team of doctors from Indo-Tibetan Border   (ITBP) camp and district administration had provided them the required medical aid. “They have assured us of help till the situation improves,” Sukanto said from Chitkul.
 
 In Barasat’s Kolupukur area, relatives of the stranded tourists are keeping a close watch on news channel to get updates on the weather conditions in Himachal. They are parying for the safe return of their kin. “We have got a call from Jyotipriyo Mullick. He has assured us of all help to rescue them,” said Sudipto Sikdar, Sukanto’s brother.
 
 “CM   is personally monitoring the situation. All concerned authorities have been contacted to take necessary action for safe return of the tourists,” tourism minister Goutam Deb said.
