 "We are taking with us tributes to pay to our queen whose courage has no parallel and to think of how women were expected to stay indoors in that era, it is awe-inspiring how she stood up against the British," said her great great granddaughter Manzilat Fatima, who reached Kathmandu on Thursday with siblings Talat Fatima and Kamran Meerza. "The last years, ambassador Ranjit Rae, who was also from Lucknow, had been laying the wreath on her grave and it is the first time when even though his tenure is over, we are going to be part of the solemn ceremony," she added. 
 
 Claimed to be the first ever film on the queen, the 26-minute documentary has been directed by National Award winning director   and was commissioned by the Films Division. 
 
 Back in Lucknow, an evening of remembrance has been organised as a tribute by different organisations at the  , 5pm onwards.
