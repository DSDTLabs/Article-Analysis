PUNE: The city may not face water cuts as the dams providing water to Pune have enough stock, but the situation in rural parts have begun to worsen. 

 Irrigation officials said dams providing water to Pune have a collective storage of 10.62TMC, which is 36.44% of total storage capacity. 
 
 "As per the state's directives, the irrigation department has stored water to take care of Pune city's drinking water needs. Because of the repair works in  , no water could be stored this year, but Pune will not face a water shortage," an irrigation official said.
 
 Last year, by April, the city had already started facing water crisis and rural parts of Pune were demanding more water for agriculture use. "Even this year demand from rural Pune is on the rise. The irrigation department will release water for agriculture in two phases in the next two months but this will not affect the city's water supply," the officer added. 
 
 City organisations led by   have already warned that the irrigation department must not impose any water cuts in the city to provide water to sugar cane farmers in Indapur, Baramati and   region. "Citizens must not suffer water cuts. Instead, the irrigation department must give a detailed chart of what is happening to the water in dams,"   of the Sajag Nagrik Manch said. 
 
 Irrigation department officials admitted that there is no reduction in sugar cane cultivation in rural Pune despite a severe water crisis last year.
