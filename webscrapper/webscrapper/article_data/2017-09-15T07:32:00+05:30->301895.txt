Chandigarh: “Punjab is in the thick of an agrarian crisis with its extreme manifestation in farm workers and farm suicides for a long time. There have been various attempts in the past to address the crisis mostly in form of relief measures and agricultural diversification,” said professor Sukhpal Singh, director general Centre for research in rural and industrial development (CRRID).

 Prof Sardara Singh Johl, chancellor, Central University of Punjab said that to ensure success of agribusiness in the state, there was a need to go from ‘process to farmer’ and ensure coordination between market, factory and farmers.
 
 Meanwhile, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said despite being one of the most productive states of the country, Punjab, over the years, had lagged behind other states in terms of an industrial base, because Punjab was always seen as food basket of India with a focus on ensuring food security of the country which impacted the overall development of the state. Therefore, there was a compelling need for Punjab to diversify into agribusiness.
