PUNE: The   police have arrested three men who were involved in several pickpocketing and other theft cases in Nigdi Pradhikaran area in the last one month. Seven cellphones, gold ornaments, cash and two vehicles, collectively worth Rs 3.52 lakh, have been recovered from the trio.

 Assistant inspector   identified the arrested as:   (21),   (20) and Atul Kate (20), all from Nigdi. All the three do not have previous police record. 
 
 Chavan said, “During a ‘nakabandi’ operation to keep a check on chain snatching incidents in Nigdi Pradhikaran on Monday, the police noticed three men on a scooter. The police became suspicious when the trio started fleeing after they were told to stop.”
 
 He said the police, however, managed to nab them after a brief chase.“When we frisked them, we found that they were carrying several smartphones. We brought them to the police station for questioning,” Chavan added.
 
 During interrogation, the trio admitted to have stolen cellphones from Nigdi Pradhikaran area. “Seven smartphones have been recovered from them,” Chavan said. The probe also revealed that they had stolen purses of women in the area. The booty recovered includes a gold necklace, chain and Rs 2,300.
 
 Indukane works as a driver, while his two aides are labourers. “They started committing thefts for easy money. Of the stolen cellphones, they had sold off one and had given some to their relatives,” Chavan said.
