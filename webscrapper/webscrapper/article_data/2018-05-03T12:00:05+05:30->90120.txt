NEW DELHI: Amid profit-booking by participants,   futures fell Rs 29 to Rs 31,110 per 10 grams today as participants trimmed positions. 

  In futures trading, gold for delivery in August fell Rs 29, or 0.09 per cent, to Rs 31,110 per 10 grams in a business turnover of just one lot at the Multi Commodity Exchange. 
 
  Gold for delivery in June too fell by Rs 15, or 0.05 per cent, to Rs 30,910 per 10 grams in a business volume of 78 lots. 
 
  Market analysts said the fall in gold futures was mostly due to profit-booking by participants but a firm trend in global markets capped the fall. 
 
  Meanwhile, gold prices in the global market rose as much as 0.31 per cent to USD 1,308.60 an ounce in Singapore today as tariff woes between the US and China returned ahead of Sino-US trade talks today.
