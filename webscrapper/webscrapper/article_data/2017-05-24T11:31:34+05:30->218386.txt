NEW DELHI: The system of neutral   could be out in the coming domestic season, and to ensure that host associations do not indulge in   tampering, which has been rampant for years, the   is mulling having the pitches at all venues prepared under the supervision of   curators.

 In order to ensure that quality pitches are provided for domestic matches, as many as 27 BCCI curators will be empowered to supervise the preparation of tracks for the  , like they did last season. The difference is that as host associations will be tempted to prepare pitches to their liking or team's strengths, the BCCI curators will act as watchdogs with the local groundsmen working under their supervision.
 
 It is learnt that next month's match referees' meeting will discuss the responsibilities of these officials, whereby they will have to give their opinion on the condition of the pitches. Failing to do so could cost them dear in the future.
 
 There were suggestions of doing away with the toss to nullify home advantage, but the BCCI thinks it's too radical a step at this moment. Having four Ranji Trophy groups instead of the existing three was also discussed at the meeting.
