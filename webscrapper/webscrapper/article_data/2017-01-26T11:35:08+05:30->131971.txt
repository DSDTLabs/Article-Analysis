BENGALURU: Cricketer   has declined to accept the honorary doctorate that   had decided to confer on him during its 52nd   on Friday.

 A press release from the university said the former Indian captain had thanked the university for choosing him for the honour, but “in all humility declined to accept the degree”.
 
 “He (Dravid) has conveyed that he would try to earn a doctorate degree by accomplishing some form of academic research in the field of sports rather than receiving an honorary degree,” the release stated.
 
 University vice-chancellor   said, “We’ve learnt that he’s reluctant to accept the award because he’d rather earn it. The honorary doctorate, however, is not gratis. It is a recognition we’re awarding him for his contribution to sports.”
 
 “We’ve been trying to get in touch with him, but he’s out of town currently. Once he’s back, we’ll try to convince him about it,” Gowda added.
 
 Dravid was not available for a comment.
 
 The university had suggested three names, including that of Dravid, to governor Vajubhai Vala, who is also the chancellor of the university, for conferring the honorary doctorate. Vala had approved only Dravid’s name.
 
 The convocation will be held at the Jnana Jyoti Auditorium.
