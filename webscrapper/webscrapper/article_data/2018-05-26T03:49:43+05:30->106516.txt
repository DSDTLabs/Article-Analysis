NEW DELHI: The decision to open all closed roads in canto
 nments and ensure that any fresh closure strictly follows “prescribed procedure” was in response to address considerable public inconvenience and taken in consultation with MPs, elected cantonment board members and   authorities, sources said.

 
 Responding to reports of Army personnel and their families being unhappy over the decision, government sources said the “pioneering initiative” was taken by defence minister   only after holding a meeting with MPs and senior officials of the defence ministry and Army headquarters.
 
 Elected vice-presidents of all 62 cantonment boards and MPs had expressed “deep anguish” at severe inconvenience to the public due to closure of roads by local military authorities. “Instances were brought to notice where access to these roads were denied even in compelling circumstances like emergency and medical cases,” a source said.
 
 Keeping in mind that unhappiness over road closure was pervasive and many cantonment boards were affected, the defence minister decided to act on the issue. It was found that 52 roads in 22 cantonments had been fully closed and 47 roads were partially closed in 15 cantonments.
 
 Some of these road closures were in place for almost two decades. In the case of   in Allahabad cantonment, the road remained closed since 1998.
