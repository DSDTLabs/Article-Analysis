AURANGABAD: The   (AMC) issued a notice to a property holder in Padegaon on Wednesday saying that the transfer of developmental rights ( ) certificate he was given in 2013 stands cancelled because it was issued by mistake. 

 The timing of the letter assumes significance as municipal commissioner   recently ordered an inquiry after irregularities in allotment of TDR certificates came to the fore.
 
 To widen a road in Padegaon area, the civic body had acquired land in 2012-13 from   in exchange of TDR. However, the assistant director of the civic town planning department highlighted discrepancies in the acquired land in Wednesday’s notice to cancel the TDR. 
 
 The AMC was acquiring land for a 15-meter wide road in Padegaon and a 25-meter wide road in 2012-13. It gave TDR to Sikchi while assuming that it was a case of 25-meter road, says the recent order released by A B Deshmukh, assistant director, town planning. 
 
 It is being widely believed that senior officers in the civic town planning department intentionally cancelled the TDR to Sikchi to cover up their alleged wrongdoing. 
 
 As per the order released by the town planning department, the municipal chief approved the rectification on January 16. 
 
 In the meantime, Shivaji Dange, chairman of the AMC’s city development committee, smelled rat and demanded a high-level inquiry. In A letter to the municipal chief, Dange raised questions over the authorities’ silence for so long. 
 
 “In 2014, a local resident had raised an objection over TDR allotment to Sikchi but the municipal authorities remained silent. When the civic chief started unearthing fake cases, the town planning department officials swung into action,” Dange said, adding that a thorough inquiry would dig out more skeletons. 
 
 A B Deshmukh could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
