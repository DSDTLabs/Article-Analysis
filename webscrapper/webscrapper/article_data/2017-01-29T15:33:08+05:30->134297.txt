AGARTALA: Tripura University on Saturday cancelled the interviews for the posts of associate professors and professors in four departments after more than 50 teaching faculties gheraoed the vice-chancellor A K  , registrar O S  , deans and other top officials of the university on Friday. 

 The teachers alleged that there was nepotism in the screening process and the VC had called under-qualified candidates.

 "We demand the resignation of the VC and an enquiry into each and every recruitment, the screening process, purchase and tenders of the university during the tenure of Ghosh," the faculty members said. Adhikari promised the teachers an enquiry would be conducted into the screening process for the recruitment of associate professors and professors in the departments of rural development, education, microbiology and molecular biology. The registrar said the VC has also agreed to conduct a probe. 
 
 Ghosh refused to talk to the media.
