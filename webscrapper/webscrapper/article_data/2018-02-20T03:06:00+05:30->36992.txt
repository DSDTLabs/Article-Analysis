Vijayawada: With only a few hours left before the conduct of AP Teachers’ Eligibility Test (APTET), which begins on February 21, experts say the students should use their time effectively by writing mock computer tests.

 This the first time that APTET is being held online. There are many mock tests available   on the APTET website, and students should at least take one of them, said Jumpana Sudhakar, director at Pratibha Coaching Centre.
 
 E Sravani Kumari, who took a computer mock test, said writing these exams has given her the confidence to appear for the online test even though she lacks basic computer skills. Experts say students should not worry about the mode of exam and should write the online exam, at least once, to get rid of all apprehensions. They advise those with no access to computers to focus on the concepts.
 
 Many coaching centres do not have sufficient computers to enable students to write mock tests. The mock exams conducted are usually paper-based exams. However, the students with smart phones can write exams on their phones. “The exam is the just like the written exam. The only difference is that the students do not have the question paper to take back happen and verify the answers,” they added.
 
 According to the commissioner of school education, the computer-based examinations are helpful to deliver the exam results quickly. However, due to lack of sufficient computers at the centres, there were issues in allocating centres as per choices. It may be noted that the online test has been postponed twice.
