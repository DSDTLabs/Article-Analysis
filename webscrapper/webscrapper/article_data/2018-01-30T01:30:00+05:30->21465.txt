Hyderabad: The country’s youngest state,  , has emerged among the top five states in the country when it comes to contribution to overall exports, the Economic Survey revealed on Monday.

 Interestingly, Telangana is the only land-locked state to figure in the top five that includes Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The Economic Survey noted that these five states together accounted for 70% of India’s exports.
 
 Maharashtra accounted for 22.30% of total exports, Gujarat (17.20%), Karnataka (12.70%), Tamil Nadu (11.50%) and Telangana (6.40%). While Telangana stood fifth, Andhra Pradesh stood ninth with a share of 2.80%.
 
 Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao said, “We are glad that Telangana has joined the league of large manufacturing and exporting states in such a short time. The other states have been traditionally strong in terms of manufacturing and industrial activities. What this means is that as we export more, we manufacture more and also in the process create more jobs. In Telangana, the industry footprint is growing.”
 
 Meanwhile, the survey stated that the five top importing states were Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat.
 
 Providing an interesting insight into the export data, the survey document said that the export concentration by firms is much lower in India than in the US, Germany, Brazil, or Mexico. “The top 1% of firms accounted for 72, 68, 67, and 55% of exports in Brazil, Germany, Mexico, and USA respectively but only 38% in the case of India,” the survey said.
 
 Giving reasons for this phenomena, the survey said, “There is one caveat which could help explain the atypical Indian distribution — unlike other countries, the Indian data includes exports of services, where concentration ratios tend to be much lower than in manufacturing.”
