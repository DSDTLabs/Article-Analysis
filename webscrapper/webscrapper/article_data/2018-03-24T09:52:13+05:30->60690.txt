THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : Education minister   told the assembly on Friday that the government was yet to confirm the veracity of the rumours that question paper of higher secondary second year physics examination held on March 21 was leaked.

 “Thrissur district coordinator of higher secondary has come across the controversial WhatsApp message on March 22. The message showed a copy of hand written question paper having similarities with the original question paper distributed to students. However, it is not yet confirmed whether the WhatsApp message started circulating after or before the examination date. As soon as the message came to his notice, the district coordinator informed the higher secondary authorities here and they have sought the help of cyber police to ascertain whether it was indeed a leak or not. Stern action would be initiated if it proves to be a leak,” the minister said.
 
  leader  , who raised the issue of rumours about question paper leak, said leak of question papers of important examinations has become a routine.
 
 He pointed out the alleged leak of vocational higher secondary examination question paper in   and   districts and said that the government did not take any stern action against people who were behind the SSLC mathematics question paper leak, last year.
 
 However, the education minister said the vigilance inquiry into the SSLC question paper leak last year was not over.
 
 “Departmental action has been initiated against those involved in the act. More action would follow once the vigilance inquiry is completed,” he said.
