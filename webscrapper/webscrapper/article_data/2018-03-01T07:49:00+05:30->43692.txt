PATIALA: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has attacked the new tariff policy finalized by the   (PSPCL) wherein it has been decided to charge flat rate for tubewell connections from farmers who wish to surrender their power subsidies. Akali leader   on Tuesday termed the move as a step towards complete withdrawal of power subsidy. 
 
 Speaking to newspersons in  , the former cabinet minister said there were strong indications that the government was moving towards withdrawing power subsidies given to the farmers by the SAD-BJP regime. He said the government has already proposed to modify power subsidy scheme by introducing direct transfer of financial benefits to the farmers and there were reports that the PSPCL had already started installing meters on tubewell connections in certain areas of the state. 
  
 He claimed installing meters on tubewell connections would enable the government to bill the farmers.   also condemned the governmentâ€™s decision to bring mushroom farmers under the commercial category of consumers and curtailing free power facility given to reserved category consumers, who were getting 200 units of free power.
