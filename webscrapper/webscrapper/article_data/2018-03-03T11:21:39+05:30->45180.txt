 The TV star has also launched the promo of his new show wherein he was seen making fun of his downfall and dull period. Recently, while talking to a new agency, Kapil had stated, that his fellow star Sunil Grover got angry after seeing himself in news after their fight. He said, "I think Sunil got angrier after seeing himself in news. Because he was not so angry (when the incident happened). I have said enough from my side, and now I don't feel like talking about it. It happens between friends but can't hold a grudge forever. Then I will also start feeling that 'mein galat nahi hun' (I am not wrong)."
