 “We had never accepted or given infected blood to any patient. It was a machine error as the first report done on the basis of ELISA method had come positive.

 “The authorities examined all the evidence and reports and concluded that we hadn’t accepted and given any infected blood. So we have been given permission to resume operations. We will now be following the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) wherein we will have to dispose the blood if it shows any anomaly,” Bhesania said. 
 
 “On February 4, a four-member inspection team had come for re-inspection after which we have been issued permission to restart,” Dr   of Indu Blood Bank had said and added that samples of blood collected from donors and transmitted to recipients were again tested. “Their reports are negative.”
