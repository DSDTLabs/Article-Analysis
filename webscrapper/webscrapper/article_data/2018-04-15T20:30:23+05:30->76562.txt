DHAKA: The jar of pickles still lie on the table. So does a soft drink bottle. Just next to it is a bicycle that was once a favourite of a 10-year-old boy. For a split second, one might feel that the boy will return to savour the pickle before going out for a spin in his cycle.

 
 Time seems to stand still at the   ever since Bangladesh’s Father of Nation was assassinated along with eight members of his family on August 15, 1975. Even the 10-year-old Sheikh Russel — the youngest son of   — wasn’t spared. The 700 visitors, who come to the museum daily, see it all. Except the bedroom that once belonged to Sheikh  .

The stairway leading from the corridor throws up the most poignant reaction. It was here that Bangabandhu was repeatedly shot at.
