GHAZIABAD: A day after 94 students of two schools claimed they did not get   despite registering with nearby Holy Angel’s Public School,  , parents of nine   of the latter too alleged their admit cards had not been released by CBSE. Most of these students had taken admission last year itself.

 However, Siddharth Jain, owner of Holy Angel’s Public School said all these students were either transfer cases or students from other boards and their parents were informed at time of admission that admit cards of their children might not be issued by CBSE if it finds any discrepancy in their transfer certificates. “We’re refunding fees of those nine students whose admit cards could not be obtained,” Jain said.
 
 Balvinder Singh, whose daughter studies in Cass X in Holy Angel’s claimed that Jain paid him Rs 54,000 over his failure to obtain admit card.
 
 Meanwhile, parents of 94 students, whose admit cards were also not issued by CBSE, met district inspector of schools Pankaj Pandey and registered complaint against Holy Angel’s Public School. 
 
 Scores of Class X and XII students along with their parents on Sunday staged a protest at a school in Kavi Nagar over “cancellation” of their registration by the CBSE ahead of the board exams, which starts from March 5.
 
 The students alleged that as the schools where they are actually enrolled do not offer Class X and XII, their registration for CBSE examination has been done through Holy Angel’s Public School by their respective school management through an “internal” agreement.
