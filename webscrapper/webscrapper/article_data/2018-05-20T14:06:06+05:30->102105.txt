PANAJI: Hundreds of DEd degree-holders have decided to hold a protest on May 28, outside the state assembly complex in  , against the delay in creating jobs for primary school teachers. The DEd degree-holders said that this has rendered them unemployed.

 The trained teachers have also demanded that the government form a committee to ascertain why government primary schools have been shutting down by the hundreds in the state over the last decade or so. They pointed out that while on one hand DEd qualified teachers continue to pass out of institutes in the state, on the other hand government primary schools are shutting down. This will only increase the unemployment rate among the DEd qualified youth in Goa, they added.
 
 The protestors claimed that the state government has failed to create posts for primary school teachers during the last seven years. 
 
 Around 250 students pass out of the various institutes in Goa that offer the DEd programme.
 
 A diploma in education (DEd) is the main pre-requisite for teaching in pre-primary and primary schools.
