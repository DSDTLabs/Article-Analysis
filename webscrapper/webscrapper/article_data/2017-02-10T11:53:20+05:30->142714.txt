VADODARA: The BJP-RSS group was humbled in the polls for the two senate seats in the donors’ category of the M S University (MSU). The panel propped by corporates involved with the VadFest won convincingly on the two seats largely due to 31 votes that are mired in a controversy.

 Sitting syndicate member Jigar Inamdar, who is being labelled as a rebel, and realtor  , won on the two seats. They defeated   president   and senior BJP member Ajit Patel’s son Vrajesh Patel. Bhoite and Ajit Patel were the candidates of the Sankalan Samiti that was formed by the BJP, RSS, ABVP and Maharaja Sayajirao Vishwavidyalaya Shaikshik Sangh (MSVSS).
 
 While Inamdar got 66 votes and Mayank Patel contesting with him in a panel got 63 votes. Vrajesh Patel got 41 votes while Bhoite polled 30 votes. The build up to the polls may have been intense, but it took only a few minutes to decide the fates of the candidates as only 102 ballots had to be counted out of a total voting strength of 130 voters.
 
 Two ballots were found invalid during the counting even in this elite constituency. An additional ballot paper had to be used as the stamp for voting broke while a donor was casting franchise. This has smudged the ballot paper and it could have been declared invalid. Professor Pragnesh Shah from MSVSS said that it was the MSU administration that had defeated them. “The votes included wrongly made the difference. There were also some genuine voters who had been left out. Given this situation, we had expected the result. The genuine voter voted for us,” he said.
 
 The winning camp reacted to the allegations saying that it was negativity spread by the opposition that helped them. The camp has already defended the 31 votes. Inamdar said that of these 31 votes, three including two minors did not come for the elections and only 28 votes were actually cast.
