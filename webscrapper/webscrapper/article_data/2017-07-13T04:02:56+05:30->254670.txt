Navi Mumbai:   on Wednesday arrested a 23-year-old man, Imran Chipa, for alleged breach of data of Reliance Jio customers after he was detained by Churu police in Sujangarh. 

 Navi Mumbai police produced the accused in a local court and applied for transit remand to take him to Mumbai. “Since we have to travel with the accused to Navi Mumbai and can’t produce him in court in the next 24 hours, we needed a transit remand from a local court of Rajasthan,” Bal Singh Rajput, Navi Mumbai police superintendent told TOI over phone. Rajput said the   team in Mumbai was already verifying the data to ascertain if it was actually hacked from a Jio server. He said there were clues to suggest data was hacked. “We will produce him in a Navi Mumbai court and apply for police remand to verify facts relating to the case,” he added. 
 
 The matter came to light in Mumbai on Monday evening after a website ‘magica.pk’ provided key details of users.
