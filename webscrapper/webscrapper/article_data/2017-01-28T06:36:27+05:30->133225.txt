KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police’s   seems to have been effective as the number of deaths owing to helmetless two-wheeler ride has halved ever since the drive was launched. 

 Between July 8 and December 31, 2016—the safety drive was launched on July 8—32 helmetless bikers and pillion riders died on city roads, while the figure in the corresponding period the previous year stood at 61. During the drive, a total 184 accidents were registered in the city, in which 195 people were killed. Among the death toll were 55 riders and pillion riders, comprising those with and without helmets. The same period saw the deaths of 95 pedestrians. The corresponding period in 2015 saw 216 accidents, in which 220 people died. Seventy-two riders, with and without helmets, and 101 pedestrians lost their lives during the six months. 
 
 Thanks to the drive, the total accidental deaths recorded through 2016 dropped to the lowest figure in the past half decade to 407. The previous year, the number stood at 422. In 2016, pedestrian deaths also reduced to 193 from 218 in 2015. 
 
 Those injured in non-fatal accidents also came down from 3,329 in 2015 to 3,182 the next year.
 
 “The campaign launched by chief minister   is clearly having its impact, with more bikers wearing their helmets now,” said additional CP (I)  , adding the results of 20,000 public transport drivers taking driving lessons at traffic guards were also evident.
 
 The police figures, however, seemed to look away from the worrying factors that TOI has dug up. In 2015, 412 fatal accidents led to 422 deaths, accounting for 1.02 deaths per case. In 2016, 388 fatal accidents led to the deaths of 407 people, accounting for 1.04 deaths per accident. Besides, while there were merely 11 deaths of people wearing helmets between July and December in 2015, 23 such deaths were registered this year. Three persons were killed in a single accident at the Alipore Road-AJC   crossing when a car jumped the signals and rammed into pedestrians. Even on Friday, a minibus-taxi collision injured three persons grievously. “New stretches, including flyovers like Maa and AJC Bose, are seeing speeding. Single accidents are claiming more lives than ever before,” an officer said.
