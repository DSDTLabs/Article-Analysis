Erode: A 26-year-old woman was trampled to death by an elephant in the forests of Sathyamangalam here on Tuesday night. The victim was identified as Rajamani, of Kothanapuram near Kermalam. She, along with her husband Shivanna, 30, and daughters Abhi, 8, and Sindhu, 6, was heading to their village through the forest when the elephant attacked her. “Rajamani and her family were returning from their relative’s house at Kollegal after attending a temple festival. Since they missed the last bus to their village, they started walking through a jungle path. When they reached Pailur Kalayankovil, an elephant started chasing them. Shivanna lifted both their daughters and started running. Rajamani followed him. However, the elephant trampled her,” the police said.  Shivanna went to the village and informed the villagers, who alerted the forest authorities. Soon, forest staff, along with the villagers, rushed to the spot and found Rajamani battling for life. She was rushed to the hospital, but died on the way. Two days ago, an elephant had attacked a 54-year-old forester in the same locality at Kermalam. The elephant tossed over Rasaiah, 54, but didn’t attack him further. Rasaiha is undergoing treatment at Sathyamangalam government hospital.
