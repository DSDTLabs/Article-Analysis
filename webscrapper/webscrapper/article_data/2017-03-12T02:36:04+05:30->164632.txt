NEW DELHI: The   will now be heard by a fast-track court. On Friday, a magistrate court sent the matter to the district judge. 

 The case’s next date of hearing is March 17, perhaps when the fast-track court will also commence trial proceedings. A chargesheet running into over 450 pages was filed in the magistrate’s court against four men in the case under various sections of IPC, including gang rape, criminal intimidation and unnatural sex.
 
 The 25-year-old foreigner was allegedly gangraped at a five-star hotel in Connaught Place last year by the accused, who also made videos of the act.
 
 Earlier, the woman claimed that she didn’t realise what had happened to her as she was being continuously sedated by the accused. 
 
 Aniruddha Singh, a Rajasthan-based tourist guide, Omprakash, Maqsood and Vivek — all in their late 20s — were arrested from different cities during raids conducted by Delhi Police.
 
 According to the chargesheet, filed before a magistrate court, all four have been chargesheeted under sections 376 D (gangrape), 377 (unnatural sex), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) besides 506 (criminal intimidation) read with section 34 (common intention) of the IPC.
