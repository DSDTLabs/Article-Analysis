NAGPUR: Four books, authored by SN   on Buddhism, were released by  , chairman of Buddhist Adhhyasan and Bhikkhu Ananda, at a programme held at Dr Ambedkar College, Deekshabhoomi, on Friday.

 The function was organized by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Samiti, Ambedkar College and Ava Publications, Hyderabad.
 
 Addressing the gathering, Busi said, “After spending years attending meetings and seminars on Buddhism and Ambedkarism, I noticed that the knowledge that the architect of the Constitution wanted us to understand was not properly conveyed. This motivated me to write Dr Ambedkar’s ‘The Buddha and his Dhamma’ in a question-answer format so that it would be easier for people to get the essence of what he wanted to preach.”
 
 The other three books Busi wrote are ‘Renaissance of Buddhism in India: A Pictorial Presentation’; ‘The Footprints of Buddhism in India: A Pictorial Presentation’ and ‘Gautama Buddha: A Pictorial Presentation’. The books depict Ambedkar’s struggle to get financial support for revival of Buddhism in India, various Buddhist sites and a short pictorial biography of the apostle of peace and his principles.
 
 Madhukar Kasare, member of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Writings and Speeches Publication Committee, congratulated Busi for his works. 
 
 Present at the function were Bhante Vimalti Gunasiri, Dr Krishna Kamble, Surender Mandavdhare, Manohar Zilthe and Gautam Kamble.
