NEW DELHI: The stabbing of Riya Gautam was the culmination of a long period of   by Adil after their   went sour. The two became close when Adil, who was a  , regularly ferried the girl, then studying in Class XII, to school. However in time, the aspiring air hostess realised the unlikelihood of a permanent relationship due not only to Adil belonging to another faith, but also his criminal history as a car thief.

 The 22-year-old youth refused to accept Gautam’s rejection and began stalking her. Recently, he spotted her with a male friend at a mall and a fight ensued. Earlier, he had a run-in with Ashish, the girl’s brother, when he accosted Gautam outside her training institute and insisted on a discussion about the status of their relationship.
 
 Adil and his family shifted house after Gautam’s cousins threatened him. “However, when he tried to approach my daughter even in our presence, we decided to register a police complaint,” said Girwar Singh Gautam, the girl’s father. “Adil managed to give police the slip, and we presumed it was the end of the matter.”
 
 But when he continued harassing her, the girl approached the cops in March. Apprehending arrest, Adil shifted to Aligarh, also staying in Gujarat for a short while. In the meantime, he kept sending messages to Gautam, which the family discovered. “We informed the police about this. But he evaded detection, until the tragic event of Wednesday,” said a relative of the girl.
 
 Police said that after stabbing Gautam, Adil frantically called his mother and sister and together fled from the place. A police team searched for him at a relative’s house in Shahdara on Thursday, but failed to find him. They suspect he might try to contact his criminal associates for help in finding a safe house.
