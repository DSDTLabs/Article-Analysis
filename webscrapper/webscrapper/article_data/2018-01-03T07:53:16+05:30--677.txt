CHANDIGARH: A delegation of   MPs led by   president Sunil Jakhar met Union minister for external affairs   and highlighted the need for safeguards to be put in place for Punjabi girls deserted by NRI grooms. 

 During the meeting held at the office of Swaraj in New Delhi on Tuesday, they also raised issues of hurdles in timely issuance of passport and study visa.
 
 Jakhar said although there are many passport centres across Punjab, applicants continue to suffer difficulties in securing their passports, with some of them forced to travel as much as 200 kms for verification of documents.
 
 Delegation members pointed out that while the facility of online submission of application is available at passport centres, applicants are asked to personally visit passport seva kendras for physical verification of documents on the appointed time and date. 
 
 “What aggravates their woes is that they are often sent back for failing to enclose all the requisite documents or are asked to furnish more proof in support of their claim for change of name”, said Jakhar.
 
 On the issue of women being deserted by NRI men, they suggested that the MEA put in place a foolproof mechanism to ascertain the marital status of NRI grooms. Jakhar said this would enable women and their families to verify the antecedents of prospective grooms. 
 
 He also demanded the formulation of a concrete policy as a deterrent for errant NRI grooms. The delegation included Ludhiana MP   and Amritsar MP   Aujla.
 
 Bittu raised the issue of Kuldeep Kaur, a resident of Ludhiana, who has been trapped in Saudi Arabia. He said she was being abused by her employer and does not have access to her passport. “She has sent WhatsApp videos of her ordeal to her family members back home,” he said.
