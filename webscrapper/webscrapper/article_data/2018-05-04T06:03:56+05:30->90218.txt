CHENNAI: Last July, Naveen Christo, 17, followed his elder  , Raymon Fassil, 19, to the Crimea Federal University, 7,000km from home, to pursue a   course. The siblings called their families back home every two days. On Tuesday night, when Raymon called home, their family in Karaikudi assumed it was a routine phone call from their sons, until they inquired Raymon about Naveen.

 “We realised something was wrong with Naveen from the tone of his brother. But we were not prepared for what was in store,” said Ashok, Naveen’s  . Naveen Christo and his friend, Jayavanth, both first year MBBS students, drowned while frolicking at a beach in Simferopol, the Crimean capital, on Tuesday. 
 
 It was a holiday on Tuesday (May Day) and Naveen and two other friends went to the beach. Raymon Fassil, a year senior to Naveen in the same university, chose to remain in his room and was informed of the incident by other students.
 
 “It seems that Naveen’s foot got stuck in the sand and he was struggling. When his friend attempted to save Naveen, but both of them drowned,” Ashok quoted Raymon as saying.
 
 Bereaved family members were inconsolable. Only a few days ago, the families were looking at the photographs the boys send them frequently from Crimea and were having a laugh about it. “They (Indian students) were celebrating Pongal, dressed in dhoti in sub-zero temperatures,” a relative recalled.
 
 Naveen’s mother S Lakshmi is a nurse at Karaikudi Government hospital and it was her wish to see both her sons as  . One of them is expected to come home in a casket on Saturday.
 
 The Indian   informed family members of the deceased that the bodies of the students are expected to reach their hometown on Saturday.
