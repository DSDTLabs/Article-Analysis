Congress workers today staged a protest over the upcoming film ' ' outside a hotel in Pune where filmmaker   had checked in. 

  
  
 Bhandarkar, who has directed the film which has the Emergency imposed by the Indira Gandhi government in 1975 as its backdrop, later tweeted: "Congress workers hv barged in the Hotel lobby & created ruckus, me and team are stranded like hostages in hotel room. Pune activity cancelled." 
 
  
  
 The Congress has objected to the film, saying that it may have portrayed Indira Gandhi and her son   in bad light. "Its baffling to see self-proclaimed custodians of #freedomofExpression creating huge ruckus to prevent a legitimate release of #InduSarkar," Bhandarkar tweeted. 
 
  
  
 Police detained city Congress chief   and some other workers from outside the hotel. A Congress worker said they only wanted to meet Bhandarkar and express their displeasure over the film. 
 
 They had received information that Bhandarkar was supposed to address a press conference at  , however, by the time they reached there he had cancelled the press meet, the worker said. "We then went to his hotel near the railway station, but he was not willing to meet us. Police reached the spot and detained us saying we had no permission to hold protest," he said. 
 
 A statement issued by the city Congress later said its workers "scuttled" Bhandarkar's scheduled press conference. Bagwe said Congress won't allow screening of the film in the city if it contains anything objectionable about Indira Gandhi. While some Congress leaders had earlier demanded a pre-release show of the film, Bhandarkar had said he won't screen the film for any political party.
