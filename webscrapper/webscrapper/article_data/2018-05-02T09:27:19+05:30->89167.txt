LUCKNOW: In a major embarrassment for the ruling BJP, Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister   on Tuesday slammed party MP from Aligarh Satish   for questioning   for displaying a photograph of Pakistan founder   in the institute.

 Calling   a ‘mahapurush’ who contributed for India before Pakistan was formed, Maurya told reporters, “Jin bhi mahapurushon ka yogdan is rashtra ke nirman mein raha hai yadi unpar koi ungli uthata hai to bahut ghatiya baat hai... (It is shameful for anyone to point a finger on great leaders who contributed towards formation of the country).”
 
 Gautam had earlier written a letter to AMU vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor seeking explanation for displaying Jinnah’s photo. He asked: What the compulsion of putting his picture on the campus?
 
 Gautam said, though he didn’t know where the photo was displayed, the question is why it was there altogether because after India’s Partition, there was no justification for displaying the photo of Pakistan’s founder.
