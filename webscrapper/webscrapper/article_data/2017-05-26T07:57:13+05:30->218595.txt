LUCKNOW: Even before   could ferry passengers on the new corridor on Kanpur Road, construction of a   nearby has caused deep   in the walls of Alambagh Metro station. 

 While Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation ( ) took cognisance of the damage on Thursday, guards deployed on site said that the construction of the bus stand and commercial space has been causing minor damage to other properties as well for about a week. The wall of an old temple also showed a long crack because of its construction.
 
 LMRC said the cracks in the Metro station wall “are a result of deep excavation by a private builder in an unsafe manner to construct a modern bus stand in Alambagh.” The corporation had already raised safety concerns of Metro premises with UP State Road Transport Corporation sometime ago, cautioning it about the contractor’s negligence. 
 
 The   had to build a retaining wall between the bus stand construction site and Metro station so that the excavation doesn’t affect nearby properties. However, he carried on construction without the retaining wall which resulted in heavy caving in of earth on Thursday, causing damage to the basement structures of other properties, including the Metro’s.
 
 LMRC has asked the contractor to build a retaining wall on priority and repair the damages to the Metro station. 
 
 LMRC has asked for UPSRTC’s intervention in the matter. UPSRTC’s executive engineer Mohd Irfan told TOI, “We had cautioned the contractor earlier too. We have instructed him to build the wall between the construction site and Metro soon. Until now, LMRC has not asked for any repair work but if it does, we will surely look into the matter.
