 However, Ola said it will monitor the driver-partner rating given by customers to take necessary feedback for increasing business.
 
 Ola has also agreed to the demand of airport entry and parking charges to be borne by the customers. “We will introduce a pop up SMS in the software about this,” said Ola representatives.
 
 MNS leader Gadkari said that from now on additional amount will be added as convenience charges for drop facility at far off locations like Mihan, Kamptee, Wanadongri etc. “This will benefit drivers and cab owners,” he said.
 
 On giving clean chit to blacklisted drivers, Ola has said that it will re-enter into agreement with terminated drivers who do not have criminal cases pending against them.
