NAGPUR: A 27-year-old man was accidentally set on fire by some mischievous ‘friends’, who were messing around with him on Monday evening at  . Sumedh Tirpude, who works as a newspaper distributor, sustained severe burn injuries in the incident and is currently being treated at Mayo Hospital.

 Sumedh, a resident of Mhada Quarter Chowk, was standing at Nari Square when he met his friends Rajendra Singh Bhatia and Ramju after many days. The trio went for a drive, along with two other friends, on two motorcycles. However, Ramju’s bike ran out of petrol along the way, following which he and Bhatia went to bring petrol from Kamgar Nagar.
 
 Sumedh told TOI, “They brought petrol in a bottle and started scaring me. Bhatia was very drunk, he started throwing petrol on me. I tried to stop him but he continued. So I started running from him, and also snatched a match box from his hand. However, when I was looking away one of them threw a burning matchstick at me, and my clothes caught fire.”
 
 The survivor said he was lucky as just before the matchstick was thrown, he had removed his shirt, which was soaking wet with petrol. “I was lucky I took off my shirt, otherwise I would have burned to death,” said a shaken Sumedh.
 
 Soon after the incident, the four friends tried to save Sumedh, and also rushed him to Mayo Hospital. Jaripatka police have registered a case of assault and negligent conduct with fire following a complaint by the survivor.
 
 “Messing around with friends is fine but they have taken this too far. I want strict action against them, otherwise they may repeat this kind of dangerous play,” added Sumedh.
