CHENNAI: Defender   scored two of his career’s most important goals last Saturday to help   defeat Bengaluru FC 3-2 for their second   title. Incidentally, both the goals came off set-pieces floated in by Gregory Nelson. As a reward for their contributions, Chennaiyin extended the contracts of both the players on Tuesday. While Mailson committed his next two years to the club, Nelson renewed his contract for a year.

 
 Mailson said that he never thought he will score twice in the final. “Chennaiyin is home away from home for me. It feels great to have won the ISL trophy in both my seasons at the club, and to have scored twice in the final this time is something I could’ve never imagined. I’d like to thank everyone at the club for their support and love. I will try my best to help take the club to greater heights in the coming seasons,” the towering Brazilian said.
 
 Dutch winger Nelson, who had the highest assists - five - to his name, said Chennaiyin are like a family to him. “I’ve enjoyed my first season in India. The players, coaching staff and management at the club are like a family and I’m excited for what lies in store next season,” said Nelson.
 
 Head Coach  , who penned a one-year contract extension himself, is delighted to have retained two integral components of his title-winning squad. “Having Mailson and Greg (Nelson) come back for next season is great news for me and for everyone involved with the club. They are top-class professionals with a lot of experience, and it is vital for us to retain the core of the players that made this season a success,” said the gaffer.
