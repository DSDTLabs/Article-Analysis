BHOPAL: Reared in a city orphanage, lives of two girls are in for a radical change in the New Year.

 The two minors,   and  , will get parents, a family and a home in the first week of January. And hopefully, all their childhood dreams will come true.
 
 Mammu, a year younger to 9-year-old Daggu is being adopted by a family from Italy, Daggu's parents are from  . The two are already in touch with their would-be parents and other family members and excited at the prospect of joining them in the first week of New Year and starting a new life.
 
 While 9-year-old Daggu quickly shows you toys and albums her would-be parents sent her, Mammu, does not miss a chance to tell you her about her would-be father, a writer and mother, who is a professor.
 
 She does not stop at that and passionately talks about interesting things the two have shared with her during video calls. As the year came to a close, kids in orphanage were having a good time dancing on DJ songs.
 
 But Daggu, as if unmindful of all going around her, kept leafing through pages of the album. As for Mammu, she was desperately waiting for her would-be parents’ video call so that she can wish them. Daggu was in a government shelter home before she was brought to the orphanage some eight months ago. Back then weak and thin, she put on some weight.
 
 She loves bharatanatyam and kathak dance forms. Trained for 6 months in two Indian classical dance forms, she now wants to pursue a dream — become a professional Bharatanatyam dancer and present Indian culture in Spain.
 
 Her room in Spain is already ready. All she has to do is just go there and start, practising Daggu was adopted around six months ago. Her would-be parents sent her two albums with photographs of her new bicycle, room, a kitty and toys they have purchased for her.
 
 They also introduced her would-be grandparents and other relatives who live there by pasting their photographs in the album
