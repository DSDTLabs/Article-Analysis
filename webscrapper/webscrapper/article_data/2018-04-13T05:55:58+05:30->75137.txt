KOLKATA: Behala resident   had been claiming his mother’s pension for the three years after her death in 2015. Police sources at Lalbazar said the last renewal of the life certificate took place on November 20, 2017, when his mother’s body was lying frozen at the Majumdars’ residence. Police said that at least one of the officers of the public sector bank’s New Alipore branch had certified that Bina Majumdar was alive. The certificate was reportedly issued by the bank’s service manager who will now be questioned.

 “It is clear that Majumdar was withdrawing around Rs 30,000 per month — about Rs 10.8 lakh in three years — by forging his mother’s signature.
 
 TOI had tried to contact Guha twice last week, but the official had refused to speak.
 
 The cops said they had received the bank’s response last Monday, but were waiting for a detailed report under CrPC 91 before proceeding further.
 
 “We need to ascertain a few things — whether it was an act of negligence or he was a willing partner. We also need to find out if others were involved. It also needs to be ascertained whether the Food Corporation of India authorities were kept in the loop,” an official explained. The cops hinted that they might also question Majumdar in this regard once they get his progress report after three weeks.
 
 Police sources said they were examining if any official helped Majumdar corner loans from a private bank based on the forged signature. The cops claimed they were investigating his claims seriously after seizing certain bank-related documents from his residence. The investigators have found proof that Majumdar had indeed — albeit unsuccessfully — applied for a huge amount as loan in the past three years. “He said he was ready to mortgage his house. We want to know if this desperation was only to bring his mother back as he claimed,” said an officer.
