DHRANGADHARA:  , a septuagenerian from   near Dhrangadhra of   not only contributed Rs10,000 for building a temple to their Kuldevta in the village, but also helped in the construction work. Lakshmi is not ‘allowed’ to enter the temple because women are believed to be ‘unclean’ because they menstruate. The issue has reignited the controversy over barring women from religious places.

 “I paid Rs 10,000 in two installments, like most other villagers. At a certain point it was difficult to make ends meet at home, but I did my best to raise the money and paid it,” said Lakshmi.
 
 Despite the efforts of many women like Lakshmi, the heads of the  , the dominant population in the village who got the temple built, were firm on barring them from entering. “Earlier, there was a small temple and women never went inside. The same tradition is being followed at present as well,” said Devji Parmar, who heads the trust that established the temple.
 
 “It has been hammered into our heads for generations to not enter the temple. We’ve heard stories of women being blamed for something bad that happened in the village and the same belief still continues.,” said Nita Parmar, a resident of the village.
 
 Women in Ramdevpura have lived in constant fear of going against tradition. “Women are often blamed and cursed for bringing bad luck by entering the temple, if an unforeseen situations occur in the village, community or even family. Even though they are willing, most women are scared to come forward,” said Yashodhara Salve, who works with the Goa-based NGO, Video Volunteers, which is trying to address the issue. Commenting on the issue, Zakia Soman, a women’s rights activist, said, “For most women, especially in the lower strata of the society, places of worship are often places of refuge. They are often watched over in their own families. When in distress, they find closure in places of worship.”
