MADURAI: After a man was beheaded in a drunken duel in   shop in  ,   has urged the authorities to shift the liquor store to an isolated area to avoid similar incidents in future. The party leaders said that the gruesome act has spread panic in the place, with many residents staying indoor, too afraid to walk out of houses.

 CPM district secretary   and union secretary advocate   said that the tasmac shop is located right inside the weekly market in Sivaganga where a lot of public go to shop. On the afternoon of April 28, a man beheaded his friend and walked through the market with his severed head, triggering a panicky atmosphere in the area. Many similar crimes were also reported from the area after people drink and get into heated wordy fight in the tasmac store.
 
 Though many representations were submitted to the district administration, they are yet to take any action on this. As a number of schools are situated in the nearby places, many students have to walk to the school amid binge drinkers thronging tasmac shop, said CPM.
