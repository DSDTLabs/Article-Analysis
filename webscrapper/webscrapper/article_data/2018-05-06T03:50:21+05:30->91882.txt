MUMBAI: The state government’s plan to start an online process for   in the city has been scrapped for yet another year. 

 After keeping junior colleges waiting until now, the education department has asked them to carry out   admissions on their own. Last year, the state government had planned to conduct SYJC admissions through a centralized online process. 
 
 Every year, thousands of students switch colleges after Class XI as they are unhappy with the option allotted to them in the   admission process. 
 
 There were reports suggesting such admissions were not on the basis of merit. Overburdened with the Class XI admission, the education department has put off the plan to move the Class XII admission online. 
 
 In a letter to junior colleges, the deputy director of education has asked principals to allow students to change colleges. “After completing class XI, a lot of students request for a change of college. 
 
 Accordingly, these requests should be processed at the college level,” the letter stated. A student can change his college if the educational institute allotted in the FYJC e-admission process is located far away from his/her home, if parents have been transferred, if he/she changes streams or on medical grounds. 
 
 Most junior colleges until now had put the SYJC admissions on hold. “Since there were no instructions from the education department, we had asked students to return later. We will begin the admission process now. The vacancies will be filled up on the basis of merit after giving students enough time to apply,” said a principal. 
 
 The education department has stated that no complaints or grievances about the admissions will be addressed by the office. Junior colleges will have to update fresh admissions on the online database.
