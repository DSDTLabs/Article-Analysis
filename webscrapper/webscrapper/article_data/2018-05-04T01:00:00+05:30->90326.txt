In less than a year-and-a-half of its launch, TV show 'Dil Se Dil Tak' is slated to go off air on May 28. The show, inspired by the Salman Khan-Rani Mukerji-starrer ' ', had launched on January 30, 2017. While stories of the channel pulling the plug on the show have been doing the rounds for quite some time now, BT has finally confirmed the news. 

 'Dil Se Dil Tak' ran into trouble within a few months of its launch, with the then lead actor   having issues with his co-actors and later quitting the show. He was replaced by  . One of the female leads,  , too quit recently. Ask   about the show’s current low ratings and he says, “In between, our show was aired only thrice a week, but that’s not because of low ratings. It was the channel’s strategy to promote other shows, but now, we are back to airing on five days. Having said that, it’s true that the ratings are not as high as we had expected them to be. I feel that the viewers were not able to connect with the track that revolved around one man living with two wives. Also, the ongoing cricket tournament is eating into the viewership of almost all fiction shows. I am not aware of the show going off air yet, but it is highly possible.”
 
 We also asked the lead actress   about it and she said, "I think these are all rumours and the show cannot go off air. If it were to really happen, it would be the sadest moment for me. There were low ratings registered in the last few weeks but that is just a phase. This happens to all the shows. I think the show always had a good concept and it should continue."
