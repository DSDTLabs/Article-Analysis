LUCKNOW: Political parties engaged in a verbal slugfest over EVMs developing snags during polling for   and Noorpur byelections on Monday. While SP and RLD alleged   hand behind a large number of EVMs not working, the latter shot back saying that the opposition had realised that it was going to lose and was hence venting out its frustration. 

 UP chief electoral officer, Vekateshwar Lu, said that as many as 384 EVMs and VVPAT machines reportedly developed snags during polling in the two constituencies. The CEO said that the problem apparently occurred because of high temperature in the day.
 
 The commission also ordered re-polling in booths where EVM anomalies led to prolonged disruption in polling.
 
 Hours within reports of EVMs developing snag started trickling in, RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan dashed off a letter to the Election Commission, saying that voters were deliberately being denied their right to vote. "The EVMs are not being repaired despite repeated complaints," Hasan said in her letter, a photo of which was tweeted by RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav.
 
 Akhilesh said in his tweet: "Yeh takneeki kharabi hai ya chunav prabandhan ki vifalta ya phir janata ko matadhikaar se vanchit karne ki sazish...is tarah se toh loktantra ki buniyaad hi hil jayegi... (Is it a technical fault or election mismanagement or a conspiracy to deny voters their right to vote...this will shake the foundation of democracy)." In another tweet, Akhilesh reiterated his demand for use of paper ballot in voting.
 
 SP national general secretary   and RLD president   met ECI officials in New Delhi seeking extension of polling time in areas where EVM anomalies were reported. 
 
 SP state president and MLC   claimed that numerous voters went back without casting their votes due to EVM snags. The opposition allegations drew sharp reaction from BJP.
