AJMER: The   in   is on the last phase of completion and therefore, various teams from different technical departments are visiting the airport to verify security and management systems. State education and panchayat minister Vasudev Devnani Wednesday visited the under construction airport for feedback.

 Earlier, flight operations were supposed to start from March-April this year but it was further delayed for few months due to verify certain measures. A land dispute also propped up amid this which delayed the process further.
 
 After inspection, Devnani said the airport will tentatively start trial this year in mid-July and possibly services will start from August 15 with the maiden flight to Delhi.
 
 The airport will also connect other cities like Jaipur, Chennai, Mumbai and other destinations. Some companies have already assured of providing services from Ajmer in a charter plane with 70-80 seats. Devnani said last year he had demanded from ministry of aviation to start soon airport facilities in Ajmer.
 
 Foundation stone of Ajmer airport was laid down by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and now people are waiting for some BJP minister for inauguration. An airport in Ajmer was in demand since 1982 and three paces were identified for that purpose. Thousands of tourists and devotees visit Ajmer and Pushkar every month including foreign dignitaries.
 
 Sources said Ajmer airport has already got the international code by international civil aviation organisation and it is also decided that   (RAC) will be responsible for security of the airport. Memorandum between airport authority and state government in several issues has already been made.
 
 Sources added security measures like scanners and security doors are already installed in the airport and terminal is ready for passengers. A team of Jaipur airport authority had also visited to verify the standard and quality of services.
