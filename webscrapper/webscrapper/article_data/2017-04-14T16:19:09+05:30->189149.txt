Ever since the team of Posto, directed by   and Nandita Ray released the song, Jonaki, on  , it has been the talking point of the music frat in Kolkata. Composed and sung by  , the song is featured on Jisshu U Sengupta and little Argha aka Posto. And while compliments are coming to   by the dozen,   gave a unique POV on this. In town for the trailer launch of Posto, in which he has an important role to play, Babul came down to the TOI office, where he laughed and said, “I hate Anindya. He is among those composers who can also sing well. Another man who can do both so well is   and I have a thing against both. They compose, sing themselves and deliver hits one after the other.” Truth be told, Babul is totally in love with the song and feels he too could have sung this ode to fatherhood.

The singers would both take the Kolkata stage by storm at one time and though Babul has moved on to make a name for him in politics, his first love remains music.
