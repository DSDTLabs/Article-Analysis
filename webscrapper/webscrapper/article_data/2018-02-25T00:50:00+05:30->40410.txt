Bengaluru: Vidvat L, a 24-year-old management graduate, who was assaulted by Mohammed Nalapad Haris, the elder son of Shantinagar MLA Md Haris, and his associates on February 17, is still recovering here at Mallya Hospital.

 “He is still in the ICU. Liquid has collected in his eyes, and he was suffering from fever and nausea on Friday night. On Saturday, he was also complaining of chest pain. He can’t even get up completely. The doctors say he needs to remain in the ICU, but at least he is out of danger,” said Vidvat’s brother Satvik L.
 
 Calling the attack on his brother barbaric and merciless, he said his father has not slept for more than a few hours a day since the incident. “He’s in a very stressful condition, and I am checking his blood pressure and sugar levels regularly. No father should ever have to go through this,” he said.
 
 While Anand K, the doctor treating Vidvat, said he could not discuss the case, citing “doctor-patient confidentiality”, Mallya Hospital CEO Commodore Indru Wadhwani had told TOI on Friday: “It’s been about four days now, he’s gradually improving. But we’ve kept him under observation.”
 
 Vadhwani added that the hospital or the doctors treating him have not advised or recommended shifting him to another country or city.
