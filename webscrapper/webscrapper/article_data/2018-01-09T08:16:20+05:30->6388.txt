DEHRADUN: Lack of adequate snow has forced Uttarakhand to postpone India’s first International   Championship at Auli scheduled from January 15 to 21 under the aegis of the International Ski Federation. This has dashed hopes of many Indian skiers who wanted to qualify for the 2018   in South Korea from February 12.

 Tourism secretary Dileep Jawalkar told TOI that the games would now be held from February 16 to 22. As many as 26 skiers from Europe and 90 from India were expected to compete in the championship which would allow winners to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics.
 
 Jawalkar admitted that it would no longer be possible for skiers to qualify for the Winter Olympics since the cut-off date to submit their candidature is January 21. “We had planned to hold the championship in January since it has qualifying races for the Winter Olympics. But participants will not be able to apply for the Winter Olympics now.”
 
 The decision to postpone the event was taken after officials of the   (WGFI) in a report submitted to the International Ski Federation said that snow on the slopes of Auli was “inadequate” according to international parameters. Auli received the season’s first snowfall on January 1. Met director Bikram Singh said that the ski resort is likely to get snow only in February.
 
 Lack of sufficient snow cover had also led to cancellation of National Junior Skiing Championship in Auli in February 2017 for the second year in a row.
