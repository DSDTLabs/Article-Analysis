VISAKHAPATNAM: It was a tragic sight on Wednesday at the spot where the boat carrying 44 people had capsized in   district the previous evening as relatives waited for the bodies of their loved ones to be retrieved by divers. 

 With 22 of them having swum to safety as soon as the boat sunk on Tuesday, it was clear that the remaining had met a watery grave.
 
 The relatives of the victims, mostly tribals, had been waiting at the spot near   village in Devipatnam mandal since Tuesday night and their agony was heart-wrenching. 
 
 Once the rescue teams retrieved a body from the wreckage that was pulled ashore, all of them rushed to identify it. And when one group stated wailing loudly, it became clear that it was their loved one.
 
 Those who survived the tragedy too did not have anything to cheer about. Nadipudi Aswini of Tadiwaka village, a girl in her mid-twenties, is much pitiable. She has completed B.Ed and studying D.Ed in   in East Godavari. She along with her family was returning home after drawing Rs 30000 from a bank for her college fee. She among her family members was the only one to swim ashore to safety. The rest, her grandfather who was carrying the cash, mother and brother all perished in the accident.
 
 The plight of Ram Charan, a teenager from Kachchaluru village who is being treated at the area hospital in  , is pathetic as he lost his father, mother and two brothers (twins) in the boat tragedy. Even 30 hours after the incident, Ram Charan is not in position to talk. 
 
 Sirisha, a Class X student from   village and one of the passengers, was rescued by some boys from Manturu village who were playing cricket on the shore when the boat overturned around 6 pmon Tuesday and is recovering in the area hospital at Rampa Chodavaram. But Sirisha lost her mother and son of her elder sister. It was equally tragic to see elders waiting for the bodies of their children to be retrieved.
