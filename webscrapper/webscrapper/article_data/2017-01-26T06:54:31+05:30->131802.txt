BATHINDA:   has not seen any politician getting elected for a second consecutive time in the 50 years since the state was trifurcated in 1967.

 Every time assembly elections have been held, a new candidate has won from the constituency, which is now officialy called Bathinda Urban.
 
 Sitting   (SAD) is again in the fray for February 4 assembly elections to be held in the state, while Congress has fielded   and the   (AAP) has nominated Deepak Bansal. Congress has won 5 of the 11 assembly elections held in Bathinda since 1967. SAD candidates won four times, while an independent candidate and a Janata Party nominee were elected as MLAs once each.
 
 “The record will continue. Manpreet is expected to win with a big margin. Punjab Congress president Cap tain Amarinder Singh has already announced that Manpreet will be made the finance minister if Congress forms the government,“ said Rajan Garg, Manpreet's election agent.
 
 Singla, however, said that the SAD would break the “jinx“. “We will be elected for a second straight time from Bathinda because of the rapid development that has taken place in the district,“ Singla said. Bansal said AAP had a “big chance“ of winning the election.
 
 “People of Bathinda, especially youth, want the Congress and the SAD suffer defeat, and to give AAP a chance,“ he said. Bathinda is also part of Punjab's cotton belt which suffered immensely due to the spread of the whitefly pest in 2015, leading many farmers to commit suicide.
