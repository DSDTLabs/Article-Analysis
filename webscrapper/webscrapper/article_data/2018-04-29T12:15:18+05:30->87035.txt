GUWAHATI: Fearing natural disasters in the coming rainy season, the   (metro) administration has strictly prohibited earth cutting and filling for unplanned constructions in the city's hillocks and other low-lying areas. 

 A release from the administration said unscientific and haphazard earth cutting and earth filling destabilizes natural earth slopes and blocks natural as well as artificial drains. "It triggers severe landslides, artificial floods and persistent waterlogging during rainy days, resulting in substantial loss of human and cattle lives and destruction of property. Unscientific earth cutting also degrades the environment and overall ecological balance," it said.
 
 Deputy commissioner of Kamrup (M),  , who is also the chairman of the district disaster management authority, has directed all concerned departments, including enforcement agencies like revenue circle officers, city police, forest department, PWD, transport, soil conservation, planning and other regulatory bodies, not to permit any earth cutting and earth filling activity in the hilly terrains, water bodies and in low-lying areas of the district.
 
 "It is directed that no earth cutting and carrying of earth should be allowed from May 1 till the monsoon season is over. However, for any government scheme or any project of national importance, if earth cutting is required, then that may be taken into consideration on merit basis," the release added.
 
 All concerned departments and regulatory bodies were asked to review all the permission for earth cutting and filling if any have been accorded in the current year, and take necessary steps to cancel those permissions forthwith in the most vulnerable areas prone to landslides and flash floods. City police have also been requested to take stern action.
