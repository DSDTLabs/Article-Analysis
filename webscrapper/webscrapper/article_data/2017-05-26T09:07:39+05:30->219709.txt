  I have always loved Ahmedabad for t its wonderful locations such as the t riverfront, old city, pol areas etc.This time, we shot for our show at Modhera's Sun temple. I loved the entire place as it has a wonderful historical appeal. Everytime I travel, I try and check out the heritage sites of that place.
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  Not really. In the last few years, TV as a medium has grown exponential ly. Also, it has a phenomenal reach.
  
  The only thing I was reluctant about was the storyline. Also, I wanted to take up a finite series and I'm happy to be doing a show like Aarambh.
  
  
 
  
  Whenever I get some time off from work, my wife Pallavi and I go for a small break -a road trip or a mini vacation in an interesting location. We last travelled to Sri Lanka. I prefer to sit by the sea, a mountain or even lake. Nature makes me feel rejuvenated and energizes me for hectic schedules later on. Sports too interests me as it's a big stressbuster. As for my wish list, I want to to direct a short film in the future.
