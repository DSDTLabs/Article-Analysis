LUCKNOW: The stable and safe explosive   or   was chosen as it is safe to handle and can be detonated through a mobile phone. 

 PETN is often mixed with another   TNT (tri-nitro Toluene) and RDX to obtain powerful explosives used in grenades and war-heads.
 
 With RDX, it forms Semtex, another powerful explosive. It is preferred as it can be sneaked in unusual assemblies and is difficult to detect at X-ray machines of airports. Another interesting thing about the explosive is that it generally does not explode if dropped or lit up. It needs a wire detonator or shock cap to set off.
 
 PETN has been known to be a favourite of al-Qaida which has used it in different bombing attempts across the globe since early 2000.
 
 In 2010, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQIP) had planted PETN in a plane in Britain which was timed to explode mid-air over the United States. Printer machines with toner cartridges having PETN—being shipped in the plane—were detected by police only after HUMINT (human intelligence).
 
 Al-Qaida again used PETN in its bid to assassinate the intelligence chief of Saudi Arabia Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in 2009. The same year, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was caught with PETN in his underwear aboard a flight to Detroit from Amsterdam. He was sentenced to life in 2012.
 
 Long before this in 2001, AQ operative Richard C Reid hid PETN in his shoes and tried to detonate it on a flight to the US from Paris. He was spotted by a flight attendant who picked up a burning smell in the cabin. 
 
 
 
 
 Belonging to the family of nitroglycerin, PETN is less sensitive to shock and heat
 
 It does not set off through fire or by throwing
 
 Blast using PETN can only be triggered by detonator which was not found in this case
 
 It is difficult to be detected even when passed through advanced X-ray scanners
 
 The explosion caused is instantaneous and destroys everything in vicinity within seconds
