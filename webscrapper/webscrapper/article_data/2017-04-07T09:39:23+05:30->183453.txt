Varun Dhawan, like a true bada bhai, has shopped for his little ‘siblings’, Roohi and  , director   Johar’s newborn twins. For those who’ve tuned in late, the filmmaker, for the longest, has treated his protégé as his own child. Ask Varun what he plans to gift the little ones, and he says, “There’s a lot of stuff, but it’s all a surprise which I first want Karan to see. I just hope he likes them.”

 Meanwhile, the young star has been spending plenty of his time prepping for the next schedule of '  2', to be directed by his father  . The film is an extension of the   Khan comedy that released nearly two decades ago. The idea is to turn it into a franchise. Bring up the film and Varun says, “I’m leaving for London soon where a big chunk of the film will be shot. That’s where most of the story unfolds. There’s a lot of work we’re doing before the schedule starts.”
 
 When asked if he feels the pressure to live up to Salman’s name, the actor says, “'Judwaa' entertained a generation of cinegoers. It was hilarious. It was a riot purely because of the way Salman pulled off the roles. I’m sure even our film will entertain a lot of people. I’m looking forward to starting the shoot.”
