BENGALURU: It's never easy to have a famous surname, but most people refuse to believe that there is a downside to being a child of a star. Though their sessions were separated by a few hours, both   star   and director Aishwarya Rajinikanth   had similar themes through their conversations.

 “There are many myths surrounding celebrity children. The whole purpose of the book (I have written) was to get people to say we are normal. Because of where we (star children) come from there are a lot of misconceptions and judgments about us which are not true,“ said Aishwarya. On dealing with an extended family which is the fan base, Aishwarya who is married to Tamil star Dhanush, pointed out, “We don't deal with it, we enjoy it. The way we look at it, it is more about how they have embraced us. They make you feel protected, wanted and make you feel at home wherever you are. And that is a great feeling. It is not something that every one gets to experience, but sometimes we wonder how we are ever going to reciprocate it because they share our achievements, success and happiness.“ Actor Rishi Kapoor„ ad dressing a packed house, echoed Aishwarya's sentiment in his opening comments. “I wrote my autobi ography not as an exercise to fan my ego. People have a wrong perception about children of actors and I wrote the book to dispel the notion that there's nepo tism in cinema. I may have got my big break with Bobby but for the next 25 years, I had to struggle to sur vive in the industry!“ said Kapoor.
 
 Kapoor said, “We are probably the only family in the world that has four generations in films. We live eat, breathe and sleep cinema. My father was my guru as well. As my director, he taught me everything. But as my father, we never were on backslapping terms with each other.“
