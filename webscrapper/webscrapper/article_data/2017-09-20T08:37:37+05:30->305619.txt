KOCHI: Actor Dileep approached the  , on Tuesday, seeking bail in the   for the fifth time. While the earlier bail pleas were citing merit, this time it mentioned his eligibility to get statutory bail as police had not filed a   in 60 days, the actor contended.

 Though such an argument was raised before the judge during an urgent hearing sought by Dileep's counsel on Tuesday , the judge decided to schedule a hearing on September 26.
 
 Dileep, who was arrested on July 10, had first sought bail from a magistrate court but was denied a favourable order on July 15. Through orders issued on July 24 and then on August 10, the high court had then turned down his pleas for bail.Though the argument regarding entitlement to a statutory bail was raised before a magistrate court by Dileep, he was de nied bail on Monday .
 
 In the bail plea now filed before the high court, Dileep contended that he should have been released on bail when police could not file a chargesheet within 60 days and that his continued detention is illegal.
 
 Responding to such an argument by Dileep's counsel, the court said that a change in circumstances has more weight than the number of days spent in jail when it comes to granting bail. At the hearing, the court also queried about the progress of the investigation. Prosecution's counsel submitted to the court that the investigation is likely to be completed in three weeks. Actor Nadirsha and others may have to be questioned again and anticipatory bail pleas filed by Nadirsha and Kavya Madhavan are pending before another bench of the HC, the prosecution informed. The court then postponed the hearing on Dileep's petition to 26.
