  and Taapsee Pannu. The songs will be filmed in a Mumbai studio once Varun and Taapsee are done with the upcoming 40-day UK schedule in April.“
 
 Varun Dhawan told Mirror, “It's a surprise, let it remain a surprise. People will be happy with it. All I can say is we are working on it. We are all aware it's a big responsibility and we will try and do our best.“
 
 About teaming up with his father again after the 2014-film 'Main Tera Hero', the actor said, “My father, didn't launch me because he's never launched anybody and he wouldn't make an exception for me. He only took me ( in 'Main Tera Hero') after my first film did well and he's only making another film with me now after eight of my films have done well. That's how my family thinks. I have seen the ups and downs my father went through in his career while I was growing up, I respect that.“
 
 Varun had kicked off the shooting for the Sajid Nadiadwala's production in February, at a Mumbai studio by filming a Ganpati song that will be the film's opening number, introducing his tapori character.
