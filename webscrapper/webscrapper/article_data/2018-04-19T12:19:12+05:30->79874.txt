SECUNDERABAD: With the Gough Road set to be out of bounds from May 31 for commuters, the government is stepping up the plate by knocking the Local Military Authority's (LMA) door to keep the road open for some more months till it works out new alternative routes. 

 Towards thrashing out the contentious issue, LMA convened a high-level meeting at the   and   (TASA) headquarters in Bolarum on Wednesday. Highly-placed sources told TOI that chief secretary SK Joshi will be holding another high-level meeting in a day or two. "The meeting's focus will be on alternative roads and seek LMA's approval to keep the Gough Road by another six months," sources said. 
 
 At Wednesday's meeting, the authorities discussed on the impact of the Gough Road closure and how to provide alternative routes. "The meeting discussed about transfer of defence and state government land in lieu of a 100-acre defence land for laying two alternative roads. It also discussed about the cost for constructing the roads," the sources said.
 
 General Officer Commanding (GOC), TASA, Major General  , senior military officials, principal secretary, transport and R&B, Sunil Sharma, commissioner,   (GHMC), B  , chief executive officer, Secunderabad Cantonment Board, SVR Chandra Sekhar and defence estates officer, Telangana, VB Nair attended the key meet.
 
 It may be recalled that the MoD had already given extension four times to keep the Gough Road open. The latest deadline is May 31.
