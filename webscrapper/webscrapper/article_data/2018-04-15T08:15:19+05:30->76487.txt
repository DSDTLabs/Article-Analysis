AHMEDABAD: As suspected from day one, robbery at a residence at   in Ramol turned out to be a drama orchestrated by   to avoid   which her husband Navneet had borrowed from his relatives.

 According to police, Nidhi staged the drama after she realized that the money Navneet had borrowed can’t be repaid as they had spend the entire amount. She took her daughter and mother-in-law into confidence and planned a drama. The robbery of Rs 19 lakh was reported to the police on the morning of April 11.
 
 Additional commissioner of police, sector 2, Ashok Yadav, said that as Navneet had started working in a private company in Bengaluru, Nidhi, her 13-year-old daughter, Jhanvi, and her mother-in-law stayed back in the city.
 
 “Nidhi claimed that on the night of April 10 she woke up hearing cries of her daughter. She found that the door of the first-floor balcony was open and four masked robbers were sitting near her legs. Nidhi also claimed that both she and her daughter were tied and beaten up by the robbers and later the robbers fled with gold jewellery and cash worth Rs 19 lakh,” added Yadav.
 
 Senior police officials said during investigation it was found that both Nidhi and her daughter had not sustained any injury.
 
 “Even the police sniffer dogs could not give any clue. We also took note of the fact that Nidhi had called up her friend Daksha at 7am to take her to a private hospital when the incident had taken place in the night. There were many loopholes in the story narrated by Nidhi,” Yadav said.
 
 “On April 11 night, Navneet arrives in Ahmedabad. By that time, Nidhi had confessed during questioning that the robbery was staged to avoid repayment of loans. We will submit a “Nil Report” and a summary of the case with prosecution against Nidhi and Navneet for staging the robbery drama,” added Yadav.
