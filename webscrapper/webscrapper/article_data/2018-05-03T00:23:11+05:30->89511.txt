Visakhapatnam: That   has irrevocably lost its sheen cannot be more evident, with several top-ranking students saying Eamcet was just a warm-up round for the tougher exams that follow.

 For these toppers, getting single-digit   in Eamcet-2018 serves as a huge confidence boost going into important exams like NEET, IIT and AIIMS, which happen to be their prime goals.
 
 “It is a stepping stone to greater success,” explains Tarun Verma, who secured 9th rank in the agriculture stream of Eamcet-2018.
 
 “Most students who write Eamcet do it for the warm-up, and to get a hang of the competitive exams. It serves as a good stepping stone to tougher entrance exams such as AIIMS and IIT-Bombay,” Verma told TOI.
 
 His views were strongly echoed by other toppers such as J Sai Priya (Agriculture, Rank 1), CKVR Hemanth (Engineering, Rank 8), and B Abhiraj (Agriculture, Rank 13). All of them were of the firm opinion that their juggernaut “better not stop with Eamcet”.
 
 “To be honest, we were writing an in-house preparatory exam for NEET. My aim is to make it into AIIMS and this rank in Eamcet makes me feel good, but that’s about it,” said Abhiraj Bharatam, who secured 13th rank in the agriculture entrance test. “Maybe I could have done better. However, the focus is on NEET and AIIMS, not local medical colleges,” said Abhiraj, adding that he plans to go on a long holiday once the entrance exams are over.
 
 CVRK Hemanth who stood second in the JEE-Mains exam was also quite excited to make it into the top ten in Eamcet-2018. However, he is clear that he wants to get a computer science seat in IIT-Bombay and is working hard for the upcoming JEE-Mains. “I need to do well in the second round and have no time to relax or fall back on my performance either in Eamcet or the first round of JEE-Mains. I still have a long way to go,” Hemanth said.
