AURANGABAD: An IPS officer from Nanded escaped soon after the   bench of Bombay high court rejected his anticipatory bail plea in a corruption case on Thursday. 

  The officer, G Vijay Krishna Yadav, slipped out of the court premises even as a team of the anti-corruption bureau gave him the chase. Yadav disappeared while counsel  , representing him, was pushing for some relief for his client. 
 
  Ironically, the lawyer, making an appeal for Yadav, also said his client was neither a criminal nor a goon and that being an IPS officer he would never run away.   superintendent of police (ACB)   said the accused IPS officer is still absconding and refused to elaborate on the issue. 
 
  The Amravati unit of ACB has booked the 2015 batch IPS officer on January 30 for allegedly accepting a bribe of 1 lakh through a front man, Sunnysingh Indersingh Bugai, in Nanded. - Mohammed Akhef
