 On Saturday, voting was held from 8 am to 5 pm at  . On expected lines, the turnout of female voters was high.
 
 According to villagers, there are around 700 people who live in other cities for work. All such people were also contacted by the gram panchayat and asked to take part in the polling. Besides doorto-door campaigns, villagers had also taken help of social media to spread awareness.
