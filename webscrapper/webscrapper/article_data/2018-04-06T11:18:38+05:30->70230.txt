LUCKNOW: In a chilling reminder of the mysterious death of IAS officer Anurag Tewari, a 46-year-old man was allegedly poisoned to death while on a morning walk on Kukrail embankment on Thursday. Tewari was found dead after a morning walk outside the state guest house six months ago.

 In Thursday’s case, victim   Joshi was found unconscious on the road while he was out for a morning walk. His family alleges that some people have poisoned Joshi. A case of murder has been filed.
 
 According to the police, the Shaktinagar resident left home around 5.15am and went to buy milk from a kiosk near Kukrail embankment like everyday. Leaving the milk can there, he would take a walk on the embankment road and return.
 
 However, shortly after his walk, Joshi was found lying unconscious. A woman who was his neighbour spotted him and called a rickshawpuller to take him home, said the police.
 
 Later, his uncle rushed him to a private hospital. “During treatment, Chandra Prakash gained consciousness and told doctors that some people had befriended him and forced him to consume a poisonous substance,” his uncle   told police.
 
 Doctors referred Joshi to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where he was declared dead.
