PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Traffic jams prevailed in   on Sunday despite the police’s efforts to stop entry of tourists from 3pm onwards.

 After being denied entry to Bhushi dam, revellers made a beeline for Karla and Bhaja caves, Lohagad, Visapur and Tikona forts, Rajmachi and Pavana dam, which resulted in heavy congestion on roads leading to these destinations.
 
 Chandrakant Jadhav, police inspector, Lonavla city, said, “Tourists began to arrive in Lonavla and its surrounding areas as early as 6am. As a result, parking lots were packed and the incoming vehicles were being parked along the narrow roads, causing traffic snarls around Sunday afternoon. Those who travelled to Bhushi dam and other areas, returned to Lonavla between 8pm and 9pm which led to choked roads in the night too. Besides installing barricades, policemen were deployed on the road towards Bhushi dam to prevent vehicles from moving ahead.”
 
 Many truck drivers who were headed to Khalapur and beyond used the old   highway and passed through Lonavla town. This intensified congestion in the town, said Jadhav.
 
 “We deployed as many as 12 officers and 120 police personnel to control the situation in and around the city,” said Jadhav.
 
 He said that the tourists who arrived in local trains also added to the traffic woes. “These tourists got down at Lonavla railway station and walked to the scenic spots,” Jadhav said.
