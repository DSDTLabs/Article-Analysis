RAJKOT: The special team investigating the   of two persons on January 1 night will now focus on unravelling the larger conspiracy allegedly hatched by a group of policemen, five of whom were arrested on Thursday. 

 The five cops of   including inspector SN Gadu, sub-inspector S B Solanki and constables -Hitesh Parmar, Chetansinh Gohil and Anilsinh Gohil - were suspended on Friday. They were arrested on Thursday and remanded to four days custody of the special team.
 
 The special team submitted a 12-point remand application before the court to seek their custody. “We want to prove when and where was the conspiracy, if any, was hatched and involvement of other persons in this crime. Moreover, the accused had tried to fabricate evidence and destroy some proofs in this case. The accused being policemen, we can’t reject the possibility that they conspired to hide the evidence and this needs thorough probe,” the remand application stated. 
 
 Another important fact that needs to be probed is who tipped off the police that the five persons were in Dhrangadhra and on whose order, they were handed over to Thorala police station, sources said. 
 
 Prakash Lunagariya, a small-time bootlegger and Shaktisinh Zala, were allegedly killed in the police custody. The police had tried to pass it off as bloody clash between a gang of five over looted booty. 
 
 Massive protests by Lunagariya’s family with the help of Patidars forced the police to take the complaint of his father who alleged that his son was killed by cops. It was during the identification parade that the other three others arrested -- Yuvrajsinh Zala, Kadar Malek and   -- had identified PI Gadu. 
 
 Zala, one of the prime witness, is on a life support system due to failure of both kidneys and his condition continues to be extremely critical. His family has, however, claimed that he had no history of illness.
