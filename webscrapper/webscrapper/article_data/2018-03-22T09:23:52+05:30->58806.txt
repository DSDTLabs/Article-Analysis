Will you watch a movie which is a cinematic adaptation of a play, or watch a play only because it’s a theatrical adaptation of a film? Delhiites would prefer both. Or so it seemed when   staged his play Kishan vs Kanhaiya, directed by  , at Siri Fort recently as a part of the Delhi Theatre Festival. The audience couldn’t help but compare the play and the 2012 film 'OMG! Oh My God' (which was the screen adaptation of the play). There were even arguments among the audience members whether the play was good or the film. The story revolves around  , an atheist whose antiques shop is destroyed in an earthquake. He files an insurance claim that is rejected because the shop was destroyed by an act of God – a standard clause that insurance policies have – forcing him to file a lawsuit against God. 

  
  
 
  
 The audience found the conversation between Kanhaiya and Kishan Lal most interesting. However, some movie buffs missed   who played God in the film. Moumita Banerjee, an analyst, said, “It was quite a thought-provoking and intelligent play. It’s been almost six years since the film released and I haven’t yet forgotten it. I had come hoping that Akshay might have a small role in the play or there might be a message by him in the end.”

 The script was full of witty one-liners, which garnered applause from the audience.  , a homemaker, said, “For me, the best thing about the play was that it hits you directly. In the film, there’s a judge and all the questions are directed to him. But in the play, nobody is playing the judge for the courtroom scenes. Every cast member looks at the audience while presenting their argument, making you feel responsible – that you are the judge and you should decide.”
