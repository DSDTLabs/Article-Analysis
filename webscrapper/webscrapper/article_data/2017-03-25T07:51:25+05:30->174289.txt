LUCKNOW: There are few takers of Tunday’s chicken kababs introduced in place of buff kebabs on Thursday. The 120-year-old outlet was forced to tweak its recipe due to non-availability of buffalo meat following government crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses. A similar situation was witnessed at Raheem’s which is selling nahari and pasandey made out of mutton. 

 Haji Raees Ahmad, owner of Tundey Kababi, said, “We have lost our daily customers. Even foreigners refuse to take chicken kababs.” 
 
 Rehan Sheikh, a resident of Shahjahnpur, reached Tunday and asked for 40 kababs to be packed. However, he ended up taking only two, just to try. “I was disappointed,” he said. Haji Zubair Ahmad, of Raheem’s, said sales have dipped by 80% because foodies are not ready for mutton nahari and chicken pasandey.
