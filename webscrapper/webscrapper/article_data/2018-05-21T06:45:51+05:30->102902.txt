NEW DELHI: With   (Isro) promoting outsourcing of rocket manufacturing job to the private sector, Larsen and Toubro (L&T) is going to set up a factory in Coimbatore at a cost of Rs 500 crore to manufacture engine motors exclusively for the Indian space agency.

 J D Patil, director, defence, L&T, said the factory would be ready within this financial year. He said L&T would also manufacture various components of satellites such as heat shields and other components that form the basic structure of a satellite.
 
 Talking to TOI, Isro chairman   said, "We are enhancing industry participation in manfacturing of hardware to meet our increased demand for rockets. L&T is doing a great job in supplying hardware for our Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (rocket). Its upcoming plant will definitely increase the supply of engine hardware to us." 
 
 The chairman said, "Currently, the industry, including L&T, Godrej, MTAR Technologies, are engaged in supplying hardware for rocket engines. Later, we will ask them to manufacture the entire rocket." The increased participation of the industry will help Isro realise its objective of getting an entire rocket built by the private sector by 2021.
 
 In order to boost space infrastructure to fulfil the national requirement of having more satellites related to fields of communication, navigation and earth observation, Isro wants to double the number of launches from eight to 10 to 18-20 annually. For it, the space agency will require smooth and increased flow of rocket hardware to its space facilities. Therefore, Isro wants more and more involvement of the industry in manufacturing of its rockets.
 
 Isro will also rope in private companies or consortiums for its mini-PSLV project, which will be tested by the mid-2019 and is aimed at tapping the small satellite launch market. The chairman earlier told TOI, "Isro will initially build one or two mini rockets. Thereafter, private companies will be given the contract to build them."
