 LUCKNOW: The clock had been ticking and with each passing second since 10am on Saturday, Mayuri   was getting more anxious. The young girl was expecting her   to be declared any minute.
 
 
 “Only the date when the results would be declared was conveyed to us, but there was a lot of confusion about the time. I had asked my friends and there were different versions. After waiting for over two hours, the results were finally made public at 12:30 pm,” she said.
 
 But it was not just the time factor, several other technical glitches added to the students’ stress on Saturday.
 
 “I was trying to check my results, but the official website of   just remained a white blank space for several minutes,” said  , a student. A number of students saidd that their results were not accessible in their entirety. “The result initially just showed my marks of only two subjects,” said  .
 
 While CBSE had said that results could be accessed by sending in a text message to the CBSE registered mobile number, the facility too did not run smoothly in initially. A number of students also claimed that in the beginning, apart from the server taking too long to function, their results were coming in some encrypted format that got resolved after several attempts at refreshing the page.
