AHMEDABAD: One day after city crime branch busted a con call centre in Danilimda,   police on Friday arrested two youths for running a similar call centre in their jurisdiction. Investigators said the call centre alleged started operating earlier this month. The prime accused in this case was part of a similar set-up earlier, they added.

 According to Vejalpur police, a team led by sub-inspector   was on patrol at 4am on March 9. Working on specific information, they raided a home on the third floor at   near Venus Parkland and found two youths making calls via a MagicJack device to US citizens. 
 
 Investigators seized two laptops and other equipment from the spot and arrested Amit  , 25, a resident of Rudrabaug Society and  , 22, a resident of Madhulakshmi Society, Vejalpur, under sections of the IPC and the IT Act.
 
 A U Tapariya, inspector of Vejalpur police station, said Pansara earlier worked at a similar call centre on CG Road. “When the call centre operator moved to Mumbai, Pansara decided to start out on his own. According to our investigation, he had data from his previous employer which he intended to use for his own ‘business’. We have roped in forensic science experts to analyse the laptops to get details of financial transactions and the database of phone numbers,” he said.
 
 Investigators said the duo would scam US citizens by offering payday loans and extracting ‘processing fees’ through prepaid cash cards such as I-Tunes.
