JAIPUR:   believed his   would never be busted in his lifetime, but despite his best efforts to evade cops, the   (SOG) of Rajasthan police arrested him on Friday. 

 “Devani is a lawyer and he was trying to obtain an anticipatory bail. He left no stone unturned to avoid his arrest as he even tried to use his other connections. In fact, since December, he was hiding in over a dozen cities like Indore, Bhopal, Haldwani, Alwar, Delhi etc,” said a senior official of SOG.
 
 Devani was arrested from Goa where he had gone to pray at Maruti Temple to seek divine interventions. According to SOG IG Dinesh MN, Devani was the ‘chief architect’ of the gang that extorted Rs 25 crore from 20 affluent people by   them in false rape cases. 
 
 “Other gang members like Akshat Sharma would supply girls and introduced them to affluent people like lawyers, doctors and builders. Sharma would pose himself as a journalist and extort money based on video clippings. If the money is not paid, they will lodge an FIR against the victim,” an official said.
 
 Naveen Devani and Nitesh Bandhu would take care of legal and police procedure and fix a deal with victims. “Devani and Bandhu would pose themselves as lawyers of the girl, once the money is paid, the girl will turn hostile in the court,” the SOG official told TOI. 
 
 The gang trapped as many as 20 people in three years. “Blackmailing offered them huge hush of money, their victims silently paid them money to get the case settled as soon as possible,” the official said.
 
 With the latest arrest of Devani, the SOG have put all kingpins of the gang behind bars, the cops had earlier arrested Akshat Sharma, Nitesh Bandhu and Anand Shandaliya.
