 "Assam will always be there by Manipur," he said at the   in Imphal's Nitaipat Chuthek.
 
 Sonowal said  , who was sworn in as chief minister on Wednesday, would ensure peace and development in Manipur.
 
 "Today is a great day not only for Manipur, but the entire northeast," he said, adding that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, BJP would bring about sweeping changes in Manipur.
 
 He said Assam and Manipur would have to march forward together. "We have to win elections in the remaining states of the region - Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram," he added, hinting at the saffron party's plans to spread wings in the northeast. Of the three states, Meghalaya and Tripura go to the polls next year.
 
 Sonowal, who had ended Congress's 15-year rule in Assam last year, arrived in Imphal on Wednesday to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new BJP government. Last month, he took part in the party's poll campaign in Manipur and addressed many election rallies for BJP candidates.
 
 The Assam chief minister accused Congress of not caring for the northeast and added that Modi had given the region a chance to march forward.
 
 "People have decided to throw out the non-performing Congress government. They have decided to bring BJP to power. I believe N Biren Singh will work to fulfil the expectations of Manipur," he said.
 
 Sonowal added that the region could now utilize its potential. "Modi has said if there is development in the northeast, the country can prosper," he said.
