PANAJI: The state government has stopped accepting applications for regularizing unauthorized structures in view of a public interest litigation (PIL) before the   at Goa challenging the validity of the  , 2016 legislation. 

 The 180-day deadline to accept the forms from persons desiring to regularize their   and structures ended on December 23, 2016, however, the government had extended it by a month.
 
 But many applicants who approached the deputy collector’s office to submit their forms during the last few days were disappointed as authorities had stopped accepting the forms soon after the court passed an interim order on December 20, 2016. But no stay order has been granted.
 
 It was a major issue for the BJP government with elections looming ahead as it enacted the legislation seeking to grant relief to the owners of thousands of illegal houses. 
 
 The announcement of assembly elections on February 4, 2017 has brought into force the code of conduct, and the fate of the scheme hangs in balance, sources said.
 
 “The process of accepting the forms has been stopped due to the high court order,” a source said. The high court had issued notice to the government on PIL filed by a social activist,  . “Considering that the constitutional validity is challenged in the above petition, the question of granting stay on the legislation in question would not arise. 
 
 In any event, it is well settled that any further action based on legislation under challenge will be subject to further orders of the pending petition,’’ the high court had observed in an interim order on October 24, 2016.
 
 When the matter came up for hearing recently, the high court ordered that the hearing will be expedited. 
 
 The state government has received a total of 2,190 applications out of which the highest number of applications (614) are from Quepem taluka followed by Pernem with 499.
