  : A day after   leader Purandeswari's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi against turncoat ministers in the   cabinet, TDP MLC Buddha   has written an open letter to her alleging that she had also defected Congress to join BJP. 

 In the letter written on Wednesday, Buddha Venkanna found fault with her for not raising the issue when   chief Y S Jaganmohan Reddy 'troubled' a few TDP leaders to join his party. "It is evident that you have written the letter out of jealosy towards Nara family. You have been a minister during the Congress regime and kept silent when AP was bifurcated. Realising that there is no future for the Congress, you defected to BJP. Isn't that a defection?" he questioned. He also pointed out that Purandeswari played a silent spectator role when former chief minister YSR encouraged defections to Congress.
 
 He said that Purandeswari never criticised YS  ."This is making people think that you will contest the next polls on YSRC ticket. As a daughter of late N TR, you have the responsibility to clarify your stance to public," he added.
