 Kanyakumari: An elephant trampled its mahout to death at Valkulam in Kanyakumari district on Tuesday.
 
 The deceased was identified as Prashanth, 22, a resident of Anandhamangalam near Pudukadai. 
 
 Police said the female elephant, Madhumathi, belongs to one John of Unnamalaikadai. The elephant had participated in a festival at Sankaranarayan temple at Nattalam near Marthandam on Monday night. Two mahouts Rajkumar, of Arasankulam, and Prashanth accompanied the elephant.
 
 On Tuesday morning, Rajkumar had gone to collect his dues from the temple, while Prashanth guided the pachyderm to its village. They were near the Virikode Kurumbetri Bhagawathy Amman temple at Valkulam on the Nattalam-Marthandam Road when the animal threw Prasahanth off its back and trampled him. It then threw the injured mahout into a nearby tank. Villagers rushed to the spot on hearing the manâ€™s cries, but he succumbed to his injuries.
 
 Meanwhile, the elephant continued to stomp and trumpet. The owner, John, and the other mahout, Rajkumar, rushed to the spot, pacified the animal and took it to a nearby coconut grove and tethered it.
 
 Investigations revealed that the mahouts had taken the elephant to participate in another temple festival near Thengaipattinam before bringing it to Nattalam temple. They said that the elephant could have been irritated as it had not been fed properly due to the constant travel.
