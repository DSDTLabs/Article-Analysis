CHENNAI: Nearly 50% of candidates who were called for   for   and dental admissions didnâ€™t turn up on Monday.

 Of the 2,310 candidates who were called, as many as 1,124 candidates were absentees while 1,186 candidates attended the counselling.
 
 A total of 62 seats were allotted. While the number of seats allotted in government colleges was 39 of the 41 available seats, 23 of 61 seats were allotted in self- financing colleges.
 
 G Selvaraj, secretary, selection committee, said the clinical seats have already been filled up except for the reserved students. The absenteeism could be due to a number of reasons - one of them could be due to the fact that it is mostly non-clinical seats that are left out as most of the clinical ones are taken, he said. These include pathology, microbiology and anatomy. He said that since the process of counselling is still ongoing, the remaining seats too are expected to get filled up in the coming days.
 
 The NEET-based single window counselling began on May 19.
 
 This year, there are 864 PG degree and diploma medical seats across 15 government colleges after the state surrendered 50% of seats for admission through the all India quota by the Directorate General of Health Services.
