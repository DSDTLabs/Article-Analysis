Tthough her ‘viral wink’ in the promo song of   movie   made   an overnight internet sensation, it also brought her trouble in the form of a handful of FIRs. Soon after the video went viral on social media, a case was registered at Falaknuma Police Station, Hyderabad, under Indian Penal Code’s Section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs). the actress then approached the  , seeking to quash the FIR lodged against her as well as the director and producer of the Oru Adaar Love. 

 On Wednesday, the Supreme Court stayed all criminal proceedings against Priya Prakash Varrier and said that in future, no FIR can be lodged against Varrier in connection with the promotional song, Manikya Malaraya Poovi.
 In her petition, the actress argued that “criminal complaints have been instituted by various fringe groups based on a distorted and incorrect interpretation of the song in the states of  , Maharashtra and similar complaints are likely from other non- Malayalam speaking states as well.” 
 
 The petition also contended that the “song is originally from an old folk song from Kerala which was written in 1978 by PMA Jabbar and was first sung by Thalassery Rafeeq, in the praise of the Prophet and his wife Beevi Khadija” and that “the claims that it hurts the religious sentiments are without any basis. The song is a Mappila Song, and therefore a part of the Muslim tradition in Kerala and does not offend any religious sentiment of any community or person,” she added. 
 
 Keeping in mind that two more FIRs have been registered against the actress, one with Mumbai Police and another at Jinsi police station at Aurangabad, the three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra ordered that no state across the country shall entertain any criminal action or complaints against Varrier or the film’s director and producer in connection with the song.
