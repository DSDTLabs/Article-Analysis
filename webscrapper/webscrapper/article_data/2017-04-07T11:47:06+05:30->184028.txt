 Jon   ended a concert in   after complains of sore throat.The 55-year-old musician cut short his performance at the PPG Paints Arena because he was feeling a bit under the weather. Bon Jovi told the crowd that he was suffering from a bad cold since his gig in Connecticut on April 1, but insisted on continuing the show for the sake of his fans. 

  
  
 
 "I apologise. But I'm gonna keep pushin' on and if you stick it out with me, I'll stick it out with you," said Bon Jovi. Despite his best efforts, the band had to wrap up the show which is normally two-and-a-half hour set. 
 
 According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bon Jovi sang "Bad Medicine" and ended the show after 90 minutes. He also made the night memorable for a fan when he asked one of the people to come up and sing a karaoke with the group on the hit "Born to be My Baby". 
 
 "This is the day when I need a karaoke  . Which one of you guys in a bar band knows all the words to Bon Jovi songs?" the legend asked. 
 Bon Jovi then ended the concert where the audience sang 'Livin' On A Prayer' along with the band.
