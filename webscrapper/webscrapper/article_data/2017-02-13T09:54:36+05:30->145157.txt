CHENNAI: In the past week as Tamil Nadu witnesses a power struggle between chief minister O Panneerselvam and AIADMK general secretary V K  , social media users have their own take through witticisms and memes. The most recent and pointed of attacks was on Sasikala, after she spoke to the party broadcast network Jaya TV. 

 A tweet from AIADMK’s official account which posted a snippet of her interview didn’t go down well with the Twitterati. Sasikala said was used to threats from the opposition party members, “I am unfazed because the common people are still very much with us.”
 
 A slew of jibes, slurs and jokes started mounting as replies to this statement. “I am going to nominate the video for joke of the year” read one of the milder tweets by @Karthik_mp. Some others urged her to start following news to know what the people of the state really want, while others didn’t hold back in calling her close aides rowdies, mafia, and even christening her the female ‘powerstar’. The rebuttals also came in the form of memes floating Panneerselvam’s photograph next to Jayalalithaa with captions like “I support   for chief minister”.
