NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday stayed a Madras high court order, which had laid down stringent eligibility criteria for advocates to contest elections to become office-bearers of regulatory body   after Tamil Nadu advocate general made startling allegations.

 
 The AG had written a letter to the BCI saying he had received several reports from advocates saying the going rate for single vote was Rs 30,000 and that candidates were indulging in bulk purchase of votes by giving money to advocate associations for a promise that enbloc support vote from the association members. 
 
 Chennai-based advocate A M Mohan challenged the   order before the SC. On Wednesday, he told a bench led by CJI Dipak Misra that once the election process has been notified and was to take place on March 28, the HC could not have interfered in the election process by introducing new norms. The Madurai bench of the HC had on February 16 asked each advocate candidate contesting BCI elections to disclose assets. The   stayed the HC order. However, the SC clarified it was not good for the BCI to have advocates with criminal record contesting elections. Though it did not debar them from contesting, it told the candidates to disclose their criminal record to enable voter-advocates to make an informed choice.
