 Some showrooms remained closed, while some kept their front doors locked.
 
 “They (dealers’ officials) told me that bikes were completely sold out on Friday. Now, no bike is available for sale on discount,” Ravindra Kumar, a resident of the Walled City, said.
 
 He said that he got the information quite late that bikes were being sold on heavy discounts. However, majority of the customers did not get to buy the bikes as dealers had limited stocks.
 
 The customers remained outside showrooms hoping that they would get to buy the BS III bikes. But they were disappointed as they had to leave the place empty-handed.

 People were also seen approaching ‘influential persons’ for help in buying new bikes.
