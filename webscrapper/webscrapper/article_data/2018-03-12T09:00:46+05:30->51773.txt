KALABURAGI: M  , opposition leader of the  , revealed that he has been receiving death threats over the last three months. Kharge said he has filed a complaint with the Tughalak police station in New Delhi. He claimed unknown persons have been calling him from different phone numbers, threatening to kill him.

 Speaking to the media in   on Sunday, Kharge said he had written to the Union home minister and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha on the issue. He said he has left it to the police to deal with the matter.
 
 “It is a very bad thing that opposition leaders are getting such calls,”
 
 Kharge said. “But when Prime Minister Modi himself indirectly threatens us by saying things like you won’t be there after the next elections, then why should not others be emboldened to make such threats? I would have died when I was sixyears-old, but I have lived to 76 because of the affection and trust of people.”
 
 Kharge was also critical of Ashok   joining   and wondered what the gain would be for the party. He said he was not consulted before Kheny was inducted. “I have no idea why Kheny has joined Congress. People who brought him into the party have to explain how his joining will benefit the Congress party,” he said.
