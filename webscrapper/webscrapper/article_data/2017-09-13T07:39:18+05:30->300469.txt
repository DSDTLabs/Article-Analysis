KOLKATA: Keeping in mind the increasing traffic congestion at the Kolkata airport junction, the government is planning to build a flyover that will connect airport gate number 1 on VIP Road with gate number 3 on  . The public works department (PWD) is taking up a feasibility study on the proposal mooted by the Dum Dum Municipality.

 Municipality chairman Harendra Singh said that they have given the proposal to have an elevated corridor at the aiport junction to ease out the vehicular traffic congestion. "PWD will look into it. A flyover on the stretch will be able to de-congest the traffic at the junction," he said.
 
 "A feasibility study will be prepared soon," said a senior official of the PWD's NH wing. The T-point airport junction that connects VIP Road with   Road is one of the most congested zones, with vehi cles travelling to and from both the Jessore Road and VIP Road ends. Thousands of cars and other vehicles cross the junction to enter the airport on a daily basis.
 
 According to the plan, the flyover will start from airport gate number1on VIP Road and will take a right turn to descend at gate number 3 on Jessore Road. While vehicles towards Jessore Road and Madhyamgram from VIP Road can take the flyover from airport gate number 1 to reach gate number 3, the VIP Road-bound vehicles from Jessore Road can travel below the flyover.
 
 "As of now, there is no space to construct a parallel road, so building a flyover seems to be the only alternative option," said consultant architect Anjan Kumar Dutta.
 
 
 
 
 The northeastern fringes of the city have seen phenomenal growth over the last two decades, resulting in a corresponding boom in vehicular traffic.Roads, like the  , have done their bit to help de-congest the approach to the airport but more needs to be done.
