CHENNAI: A city-based independent   has won a national-level research competition at   for coming up with a solar-powered device that produces a litre of potable water per hour straight from air. 

 Kumar   developed the product keeping in mind the concerns of depleting groundwater resources. The device requires only 2% of water present in air as water vapour. The equipment has been designed in such a manner that water can be extracted from the air in deserts, where the relative humidity is only 44%. “In other areas, water vapour is constantly replenished and there is no question of shortage,” said Loganathan. “The device adjusts the dew point according to the relative humidity of the surrounding and condenses air into water,” he adds.
 
 In the areas where solar power can’t be generated, the device can be plugged into a socket and consumes 100 watts, the same amount a fan uses. To put in other words, “it takes only 84 paise to produce one litre of water using this device,” the research paper claimed. The project was selected among 205 shortlisted proposals in the final round of   Challenge 2017-18 held on January 6, this year. 
 
 The major challenge which Loganathan faced while designing was the quality of the final product. Since the air surrounding us is polluted and carries various toxins, the water produced from it too was contaminated. “To eliminate this, we fitted four filters. Consequently, the final product was as clear as rain or distilled water,” Loganathan told TOI.
