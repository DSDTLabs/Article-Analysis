MAUR (BATHINDA): A deafening explosion followed by a ball of fire rising up to the sky. That is how two brothers from Maur described the first of the twin IED blasts that shook the town in Bathinda district right after an election rally of the Congress on Tuesday evening.

 Ramesh Singh (50) and Nachhatar Singh (61) were leaving the rally when they saw the explosions decimate everything in their way. Seconds after the first blast, when the Maruti 800 car in which the bomb had been planted was mid-air because of the powerful explosion, the brothers heard another bang. “The car fell on the ground, but the flames from the second blast engulfed everything,” said Ramesh.
 
 The duo said they were Congress workers and had gone to the rally in support of the Congress candidate from   seat, Harminder Singh Jassi. They were headed back home when terror struck. “Jassi’s car was crossing the Maruti at the time of the explosion. As soon as we came to our senses, we rushed to his car and found his election office in charge burnt badly,” Nachhatar said. “Jassi escaped unhurt, though his car was damaged in the incident.” 
 
 Nachhatar said the speaker on the stage had been making announcements to the owner of the Maruti to remove it. “He had just finished when we heard the blast,” he said.
 
 Ramesh was struck by splinters of the second bomb in the legs, and is under treatment at a hospital near the blast site. Nachhatar escaped with minor injuries. “We panicked and could not understand whether it was a bomb blast or a cylinder had burst. People took me to nearby hospital. We got to know that they were IED explosions today,” Ramesh said.
