PUNE:   have written to the developer of Amanora township, in Hadapsar, to remove the “tyre killer” traffic arresting system that had been installed by the township to curbing wrong-side driving.

 Recently, a video clip showing vehicles passing over the tyre killer had gone viral. The police have said the system may endanger lives of vehicle users. As per the police notice, the system has been fitted on the premises of Amanora township without permission. “The iron-made tyre killer has reduced the public road’s security. It may lead to a serious accident and cause threat to the lives,” stated the letter issued by the traffic police of Hadapsar division.
 
 The developers, meanwhile, said the notice has come as a surprise. “We got a pat on the back from the who’s who of the society, including senior police officials. In fact, replication of this project in other parts of the city was also being discussed. But now we have been asked to remove the system. We will follow the orders,” said Sunil Tarte, vice-president of City Corporation Ltd, the developers. Tarte said the cost of developing these traffic arresters is Rs 20,000 per metre. The system has been operational for nearly 45 days. The incidence of wrong side driving has gone down. A guard is also stationed at the spot.
 
 Activists too have suggested that the system should be studied before seeking its removal. Prashant Inamdar of Pedestrians First organisation said, “Wrong side driving is a serious issue. It has cost lives. The police are not able to deal with the issue due to lack of manpower. If citizens are coming up with innovative solutions, they should be encouraged. If the study proves that the system is not life-threatening, then it should be continued,” he said.
