BATHINDA: A burnt   jeep belonging to Jaspreet Singh, presonal assistant of Gidderbaha MLA and   president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, was found near the Chhateansa village in Muktsar on early Friday morning. The jeep was being driven by Jaspreet’s partner in the dairy farm,  , when it caught fire.

 Jaspreet informed the police about the mishap. Harbhajan, a resident of Rukhala village, said he was driving home when smoke started coming out from the engine and soon fire engulfed the vehicle. He found nobody on the road so he left the vehicle and called someone to pick him.
 
  officer (SHO) Krishan Kumar said the vehicle was registered in Jaspreet’s name, but it was being driven by Habhajan. “Jaspreet attributed it to a mechanical fault so no action has been taken,” he said.
