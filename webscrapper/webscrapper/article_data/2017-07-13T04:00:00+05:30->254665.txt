Vadodara: If you ever face an emergency and call up police control room from mobile phone, chances are that your calls may go unanswered. 

 The city police may have initiated the project to modernize its control room but the efficiency of its most basic duty to respond promptly to phone calls is being questioned. Citizens facing emergency or wanting to report any incident are having a tough time when they call up the control room. 
 
 The calls made to control room either go unanswered or the call is answered after several attempts. This despite the fact that a dedicated staff of 60 cops work round-the-clock in the control room that has eight separate lines. 
 
 “Our operators are present in the control room and they answer calls whenever the phones ring. Problem lies with telecom operators. If any citizen calls from any number other than BSNL, phones at our control room sometimes don’t ring. The problem persists across the state,” Manoj Sashidhar, police commissioner told TOI. 
 
 He added that they had had conducted a test following which BSNL officials admitted the problem and have taken the issue with higher authorities. 
 
 BSNL, however, officials said that the problem is not in their system. “When a call is made we just have to route it. If the calls made to police control room by citizens availing private telecom service are not being answered then the fault may lie with their operator,” said Ramakant Sharma, principal general manager, BSNL. 
 
 The police department has also complained that the control room gets emergency calls from other cities. 
 
 Sharma, however, said that it happens when somebody’s phone is out of coverage. He, however, couldn’t explain why calls from other cities land in city police control room.
