CHENNAI: The prevalence of   breeding centres in the state that raise various reptiles such as star  , and exotic birds for sale as pets has come to the fore yet again during a recent   raid in Madurai.

 Sharing details of the raid with TOI, Shekhar Kumar Niraj, additional principal chief   of forests said that star tortoises and roofed   were seized, and that this was the first time roofed turtles, sourced from Assam, were seized in the south. “The seized star tortoises were all hatchlings, raising doubts furthered by specific tip we received that such breeding centres were functioning in   areas along the Tamil Nadu-Andhra border and in West Bengal,” Shekhar said. 
 
 The officer further stated that opening of newer airports has opened up a whole new wildlife   channel to offenders, as new airports are not likely to have adequate informed manpower to ensure stringent checks on wildlife smuggling. 
 
 To tackle the menace, Shekhar suggests a three-level solution. The first one is to increase vigil at collection points or the forest areas. The second checkpoint is to perform a DNA test after seizures, as dictated by protocol and the final step is rehabilitation of wildlife using the DNA results, which reveals the creature’s original habitat.
 
 Another official said the powers to enforce the Wildlife Protection Act for such cases can be entrusted with agencies like Customs and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, which have made significant seizures of wildlife and red sanders logs.
