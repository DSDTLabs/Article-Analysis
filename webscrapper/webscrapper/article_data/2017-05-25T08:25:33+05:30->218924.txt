NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister   on Wednesday said that the government was working hard to make the capital greener and ‘kikar-free’ soon.

 Stressing on the importance of green cover and forests, Sisodia said that while plantations across the city has been constantly increasing, it is also important to remove ‘harmful’ species like kikar.
 
 Sisodia was speaking at the inauguration function of the city’s newest forest at   along with environment minister Imran Hussain. According to the latest records, another 0.2% of green cover (nearly 800 acres) has been added to Delhi as compared to last year.
 
 “Kikar trees are doing more harm than good to the area and the groundwater levels. For example, if there 900 of these trees among a 1,000, then it means that the area is suffering from poor groundwater levels,” said Sisodia, adding that the output of these trees was very less and they tend to use more resources.
 
 Experts term kikar as highly invasive as this specie doesn’t allow others to grow around them easily. “Only 1% or 2% of the city’s green cover will be kikar. We will plant more of native species and start work on this very soon,” said Sisodia.
 
 For the first time, the government has allotted Rs 50 lakh to be spent on removing ‘vilayati kikar’ from Delhi. Forest officers said that the work at the central ridge will begin in the next couple of months where areas have been earmarked for planting native species.
 
 “We have already drafted an action plan for the central ridge. The species will be allowed to grow to a certain height after which kikar trees can be replaced,” said a forest official.
