BHOPAL: Nearly four years after chief minister   announced at apoll rally in Satna that a medical college will be opened in the district; the project is still making the rounds of government corridors.

But later when nothing happened, we gain met Faggan Singh Kulaste, he again wrote to the health minister.
 
 Again when nothing happened, a query under RTI was made with the union health ministry about the proposals for medical college that were received by it from  . In the reply we were informed that no such proposal has been received. The letter of Kulaste was forwarded as it is by the then minister of state for medical education Sharad Jain to Union minister JP Nadda,” advocate Rajiv Khare one of the members of the Sangharsh Samiti told TOI.
 
 He added, “Only letters were sent, no proposals. In the meantime, Union ministry had also informed that proposals for seven medical colleges for Datia, Vidisha, Chhindwara, Khandwa, Ratlam, Shivpuri and Shahdol were received, but no mention of Satna.
