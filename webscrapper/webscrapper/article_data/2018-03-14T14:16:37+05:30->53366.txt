LUCKNOW:   Akhilesh Yadav and party patriarch   on Tuesday described   from the party as "good riddance". Akhilesh also questioned BJP's silence over Agarwal's comment on SP's Rajya Sabha candidate Jaya Bachchan and sought action against him. 

 A former national general secretary of SP, Agarwal joined BJP on Monday with his son Nitin, SP MLA, after he was denied a ticket to the Rajya Sabha. 
 
 SP has nominated Jaya Bachchan as the party candidate for the lone seat that the party can secure with 47 MLAs. Soon after joining BJP, Agarwal triggered a controversy by describing the three-time RS MP Bachchan as someone who "dances and acts in films".
 
 "I condemn the derogatory comments of Naresh Agarwal which are not only an insult for the Indian film industry but also for all women in the country. If BJP respects women, it should initiate action against him. The women's commission should also act against Agarwal," Akhilesh tweeted on Tuesday morning.
 
 Akhilesh said it was good that Agarwal left the party. When asked why action was not taken against Agarwal while he was with SP, Akhilesh said, "I had asked him to show restraint. But why is BJP not taking any action against him when its senior leaders have criticised him for his remarks on Jaya?" Akhilesh was referring to Union minister Sushma Swaraj's tweet where she described Agarwal's comments as "unacceptable".
 
 "He (Agarwal) left SP. It is good for SP. We will never consider his resignation as a loss to our party," Mulayam said in New Delhi.
