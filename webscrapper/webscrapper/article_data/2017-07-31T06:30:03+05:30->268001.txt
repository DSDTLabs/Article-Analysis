KOLKATA: There’s both good and bad news this anti-trafficking day for the state. Even as Bengal continues to dominate others as far as trafficking cases are concerned — the state has alone registered 44% of India’s total trafficking cases in 2016 — it has also managed to rescue the highest number of missing children between 2012 and 2017.

 According to data released by the ministry of home affairs in   on July 25, the state has rescued a total 46,152 missing children between 2012 and 2017, the highest in the country. 
 
 The recovery rate, though, is far from encouraging. While the rate was more than 73% in 2014, this has dropped to 67% last year. The state hopes that by the end of this year — with several state agencies and departments working in tandem — the recovery rate can be taken to around 75%.
 
 The report also focusses on the huge rise in trafficking cases in the state each year. In 2014, a total of 1768 trafficking cases were registered in the state. But the actual number of women and kids trafficked was 1881 (In some cases complaints against more than one victim were registered). Of them, 1492 were rescued. 
 
 Similarly in 2015, the total number of registered trafficking cases rose to 2099. But, the actual number of women and kids trafficked was 2460, of which 1813 were rescued. In 2016, the total number of trafficking cases rose to a staggering 3579. 
 
 Not all NGOs like Shakti Vahani see this in a negative light. “The fact remains that even a few years back, there was hardly any effort to trace trafficked children. Now, apart from CID, cops in districts like   24 Parganas, which witnesses the maximum number cases, are reacting positively,” said Rishi Kant of Shakti Vahini.
 
 Sources said the trafficking gangs target “aspiring” girls from poor families from underdeveloped areas like the Sunderbans and force them into prostitution. “We want to crush their network here,” said an IG level officer at Bhawani Bhavan.
 
 Besides South 24 Parganas, their syndicate is suspected to have been involved in the trafficking of girls from Nepal and remote areas of Bengal, Odisha, Karnataka, Assam and Andhra Pradesh, among other states. 
 
 It was in this backdrop that child protection officials from Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand attended a four-day workshop — held at Diamond Harbour — to understand the dynamics of human trafficking in Bengal.
