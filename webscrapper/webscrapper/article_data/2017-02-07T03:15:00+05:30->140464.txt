Vasco: There was no water supply in parts of Vasco and major portions of Chicalim panchayat, Airport Road and Cottage Hospital areas on Monday due to urgent repair work of a cast iron pipeline in Chicalim.  The pipeline had cracked on Saturday morning, flooding the apartment of Sandeep Chodankar and causing a loss of over Rs 1 lakh. PWD assistant engineer (Water) Vishwambher Bhende said, “About five-and-a-half metres of the pipeline has been replaced. Now, it’s up to the National Highways Authorities of India to give it some support or embed it with concrete so that there is no pressure on the pipeline due to the retaining wall.”  The crack in the pipeline could have occurred because of the pressure from the retaining wall due to road expansion work. It could have also cracked because of how old it is. Bhende said, “For now, there is no problem. But in the future, it would have to be shifted. This would require a lot of money and so a proposal will be forwarded to authorities. About 40m pipeline would have to be shifted outside the retaining wall to avoid recurrence of similar incidents.” In the wee hours on Saturday, four persons were trapped in Chodankar’s flat after the water pipeline developed cracks flooding his flat and partially submerging a car in a nullah.  The pipeline supplies water to parts of Vasco, Vaddem and New Vaddem.
