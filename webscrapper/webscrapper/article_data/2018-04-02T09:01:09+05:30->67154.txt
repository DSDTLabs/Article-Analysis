THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   has come out against the state government move of depositing Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) funds in private banks. In a letter written to   general secretary  , Chennithala urged him to clarify on the double stand taken by CPM in Kerala and initiate an inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the allocation of   funds to private banks.

 “The snail’s pace of KIIFB implementation is definitely a matter of concern. Another is that KIIFB funds worth Rs 1,262 crore have been parked in new generation private banks, including ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Yes Bank,” he wrote in his letter.
 
 The opposition in Kerala, led by the  , has said that there were serious irregularities in the allocation of funds to these private banks as crores have been deposited in different banks, on the same day, for the same period at different interest rates. The decision to park Rs 500 crore in savings account for a much lower interest has also triggered serious apprehensions. These anomalies and alleged nexus between the executive and the bank officials should be probed, he said.
 
 “I would like to know from you whether this policy of LDF to deposit public money in private run banks concur with the myriad resolutions passed by the communist party against private banks in this country. I would like to remind you about some of the resolutions passed by CPM, vehemently opposing the privatization of banks and the risk they pose,” he wrote in his letter.
