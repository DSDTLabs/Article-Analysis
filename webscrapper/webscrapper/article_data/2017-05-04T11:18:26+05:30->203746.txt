HASSAN/MYSURU: The death of a Hassan farmer at a   hospital on April 30 has thrown up a challenge for police, who are now studying his two -and conflicting -dying declarations.

 Two versions have come to the fore in the case: One,   has accused wife   of conspiring to eliminate him within three months of marriage; two, he overdosed on a drug.
 
 Now, Mysuru police have sought the assistance of forensic science experts to ascertain whether Vishwanath was injected with a drug that led to his death. Police have registered a case of murder against Asha following his death, but they haven't arrested her because of lack of evidence.
 
 Vishwanath, from Hassan district's  , was admitted to the commu nity health centre in  , saying he overdosed on a tablet after he took ill on April 24. As his condition worsened, doctors advised his attendants to shift him to Mysuru for better care.
 
 Under treatment at Mysuru Government Hospital, Vishwanath accused Asha of injecting him with a lethal dose of an unidentified chemical at a park in Hassan town. Following this, Asha was booked for attempt to murder on April 28. Two days later, Vishwanath died; police converted the charge to that of murder.
 
 Sources said Vishwanath and Asha were not on good terms, and she had left for her parents' house within days of their mid-February marriage. The couple had come together recently, a source said.
