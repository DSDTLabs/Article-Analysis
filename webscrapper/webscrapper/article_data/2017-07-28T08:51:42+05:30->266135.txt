GUWAHATI: Confusion reigned in Parliament on Monday when Union culture minister Mahesh Sharma, while responding to a question on India’s ‘missing monuments’, said a gun belonging to Emperor   was among the 22 monuments that were reported to have disappeared. The   of the   who took control of the Mughal Empire in 1540, was found in 2014 in a circuit house in Chapakhowa in the sleepy subdivision of Sadiya in upper Assam. The mystery of the missing gun had ended in 2014 until Sharma raked it up again on Monday.

 When the Union minister was asked if the Centre had conducted any survey to ascertain the number of India’s missing monuments, he said the gun and the ruins of a copper temple in   were among the missing monuments from the northeast.
 
 The copper temple or Tamresvari Mandir was believed to have sunk in the Brahmaputra. Shah’s gun and two other swivel guns of the Mughal Nawwara (flotilla) were thought to be missing for decades until Lakshmanan S, the then Sadiya subdivisional officer (SDO), took a great deal of personal interest in the search conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India.
 
 After the discovery, he also conducted a research on the guns. The Guwahati Circle of the   had confirmed that the guns on the verandah of the circuit house and the other two in the storeroom of the house were indeed the ‘missing monuments’.
 
 “The guns should have been treated as antiques rather than as monuments. This adds to the confusion. We can sort out the matter in a scientific and technical way,” said K Amarnath Ramakrishna, superintending archaeologist, Guwahati Circle, ASI. TOI on Thursday spoke to Milan Chauley, former superintending archaeologist, Guwahati Circle, ASI, and under whose tenure it was confirmed that the guns belonged to the Mughal Nawwara.
