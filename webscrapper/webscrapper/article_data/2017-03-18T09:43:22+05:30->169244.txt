CHENNAI: Wherever   goes these days, questions about his advancing age in a sport increasingly dominated by younger players rear up. In addition, consider the fact that Anand is coming off a "mixed year" in 2016 and the scrutiny becomes that much more. With the five-time world champion turning 48 this December, he is well aware that age might be catching up with him but doesn't want it to become an all-consuming thought that bogs him down.

 "Well, the age factor is the age factor. I mean, you age," Anand, who is mentoring budding chess players in a three-day workshop that started on Friday, said smiling. "There is recognition in my head that it's becoming slightly more difficult now. However, I don't like to keep on thinking about my age. Every day that you go to work, you can't be thinking that you're in your 40s now. I just get ready for a tournament and play. I'll try to maximise whatever I can."
