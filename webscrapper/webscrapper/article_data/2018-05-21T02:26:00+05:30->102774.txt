Visakhapatnam: Work on an   concrete   and a boundary wall for the Isukakonda Sri Satyanaryana Swamy temple, located at one end of the King George Hospital (KGH), is going on in full swing. The GVMC and Visakhapatnam Port Trust have jointly taken up the road project, which costs around Rs 5 crore.

 The lack of an alternative route has been forcing devotees to cross several departments of the KGH, including the mortuary and super-speciality ward, before reaching the temple. On the other hand, it has become a nightmare for patients as well as medical personnel who has to jostle with the devotees inside the hospital premises, especially on every Pournami when thousands of devotees visit the temple. According to historians of the city, till a few decades ago the Isukakonda Sri Satyanaryana Swamy temple was a small one. Over the years, it was developed into one of the most famous temples of the city to the point where the temple had to be taken over by the endowments department. 
 
 According to GVMC engineering officials, work on the alternative road began about a month ago. “The project duration is six months,” said the official.
 
 HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao laid the foundation stone for the road works on March 1.
