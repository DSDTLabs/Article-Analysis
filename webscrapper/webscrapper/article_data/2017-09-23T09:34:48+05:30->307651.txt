LUCKNOW:   linking Vadodara with Varanasi wasn't the only connection made between Modi's Gujarat with Yogi's UP on Friday. On the day the Prime Minister flagged off the train between both his constituencies,   Corporation (IOC) announced that it will lay a gas pipeline from Kandla to Gorakhpur.

 The LPG pipeline, which is one of the biggest investments planned by the leading oil marketing company , will pass through IOC's bottling plants at Allahabad, Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi and Gorakhpur. The total investment is estimated to be around Rs 1,261 crore. Besides being a safer and smooth transport medium for LPG, the proposal will also have other benefits, including reduction of pollution and traffic jams caused by trucks. Most importantly , it will help provide uninterrupted supply of LPG cylinders. Subodh Dakwale, IOC executive director, corporate communications and branding, said, “Currently, LPG is transported through road, so there is a lot of uncertainty in its timely delivery .Supply can get hampered because of unrest, natural calamity, logistical issues, etc. However, the pipeline can help gas reach bottling plants safely without any disturbance.“
 
 IOC also plans to invest Rs 140 crore to upgrade its Trisundi bottling plant. It will also set up a new terminal at Mirzapur (relocation of Mughalsarai and Allahabad terminals) for better storage and distribution of fuel. The investment on this terminal will be Rs 650 crore.
 
 IOC will be setting up a bottling plant at Gorakhpur and   at Gonda and Varanasi at a total cost of Rs 463 crore.
