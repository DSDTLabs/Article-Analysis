Rituparna Sengupta’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing since the trailer of  's Drishtikone released on Saturday. “My phone memory is full of congratulatory messages since the trailer released. In fact, one of my phones hung as it was continuously ringing! I am happy that people are liking it so much. Many said  , my character in the film, is looking restrained yet it is making a mark on viewers. But I feel, my shots could have been used more in the trailer. I think my presence is very limited but don’t know if it is a   to promote the film better,” said the actress.
