KOLHAPUR: The Kalamaharshi Baburao   has invited entries to the   competition for the sixth Kolhapur International   (KIFF).

 According to the organisers, the competition has achieved special recognition in southern Maharashtra.
 
 Dilip Bapat, secretary of the   said, “The number of entries is getting higher every year. The good thing about the short film competition is the participation of local talent. Last year we had seen over 30 local short films and first two prizes along with the consolation prize were won by local talents.”
 
 He added that the entries for this year’s competition have already started coming in.
 
 “We are hoping to get a bigger and better response this year. The participants can submit their short film of 30 minutes or less. We are accepting short films filmed in all languages, but for all the films submitted, subtitles are compulsory,” Bapat said.
 
 Bapat added that last year around 50 short films had been submitted, out of which 30 were chosen for final screening at the festival.
 
 The winning short films will be awarded with handsome cash prizes of Rs 15,000, Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000.
 
 Another official from the Kalamaharashi Baburao Painter film society said that this year’s KIFF will be organised in the month of December. However the festival dates will be announced later.
 
 The film festival, offers a bouquet of over 50 full-length films and 50 short films with a nominal entry fee for general audiences and a discounted entry fee for film society members and students.
