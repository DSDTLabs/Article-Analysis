CHENNAI: Just a few days ahead of the start of the  , the Madras high court has asked the authorities to continue last year’s policy and exempt   students from writing the Tamil paper.

 The first bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice R Mahadevan on Monday extended the last year’s interim relief by one more year, and gave the school education authorities two days to complete all exemption-related formalities as the examinations are scheduled to commence next month. It was on March 14, 2016, that the high court, for the first time, exempted linguistic minority students from writing the Tamil language examination. 
 
 On Monday, senior counsel M Ravindran representing a batch of schools, submitted that even though a legislation making Tamil paper compulsory was enacted in 2006, it was brought into force only in 2014, and all schools were informed about the decision only in June that year. Till 2014, the government had not appointed Tamil teachers in schools for teaching Tamil language and only after the present writ petitions were filed did the government start appointing Tamil teachers, he said.
 
 Senior counsel S Prabakaran, on his part, argued that till date no rules had been framed for the implementation of the rule on writing the Tamil language paper, and the government itself was not clear in its stand with regard to implementation of the law. Students in more than 800 schools would be put to hardship unless the   given last year was continued this year also, he said.
