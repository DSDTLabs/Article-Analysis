NEW DELHI: There cannot be two different yardsticks for verifying illegal subletting of government accommodation by junior and senior-level officials, a   has said. It has recommended using uniform norms so that junior officials don’t feel that they are being singled out.

 In its report submitted to Parliament this week, the standing committee on urban development has said the directorate of estates (DoE) has specified forms for reporting of “members of family” and “immediate relations” of the allottees. It sends officials to flats to verify who all are staying in such accommodation and whether these have been sublet by the allottees. However, there is no reporting format in case of domestic helps for higher category of accommodation for senior officials. Such higher category accommodations have servant quarters.
 
 The panel noted that verification of servants kept by the allottees is their responsibility. “The allottees concerned are responsible to engage servants in their attached servant quarters duly verified by themselves. The committee is surprised to note that DoE has no role in verification of servant quarters. DoE may have no role in engaging servants but they may ask for verified report of servants through allottees. This may help in prevention of subletting of servant quarters,” the panel said.
 
 “Verification of domestic servants and reporting to DoE should be specified so as not to spare any senior   officials and Group- A allottees from misusing the government houses and its premises in terms of commercial use/subletting etc,” the report said. It said uniform format of reporting will remove the stigma that DoE adopts the rule which are protective and selective for senior officials and discriminatory, opaque and humiliating for lower-rank government allottees.
