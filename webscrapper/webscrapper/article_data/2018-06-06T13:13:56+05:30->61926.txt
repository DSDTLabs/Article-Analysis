KOCHI: At a time when policy makers and development activists across the globe are clamouring for assimilation of indigenous population with the mainstream society,  , a cultural anthropologist and social entrepreneur from Australia is of the view that assimilation is neither a good idea nor a solution to the issues the indigenous communities face. 

 "The kind of assimilation happening these days is forced. In the name of development, we are imposing our rules and social norms upon them which are resulting in conflicts. Indigenous people should be empowered and given space to formulate their own ideas. The solutions to the problems of indigenous communities should emerge from within but we can provide them with the resources they need," said Anna, who was in Kochi following a two - day visit to Rajiv Gandhi Model Residential School, Noolpuzha in  .
 
 "When I first went to meet the tribal students, I thought language would become a barrier in terms of expressing and conveying our thoughts and ideas. But to my surprise the tribal students turned out to be excellent communicators. They were full of vibrant ideas and concepts. Meanwhile, the word - 'selfie' which they uttered was the most surprising of all. From the moment I stepped in they were asking me to take selfies along with them," she said.
 
 "I was of the understanding they would be unaware of technological developments as they mostly lead a life cut - off from the outside world, she added.
 
 Anna said that though this time she could not deeply delve into the life, customs traditions as well as challenges faced by the tribal people of Wayanad, she would come back once again to document their life.
 
 Anna is also the founder - director of  , a startup based in Australia that focuses on harnessing the power of immersive technologies, including virtual reality to provide solutions to global humanitarian issues.
