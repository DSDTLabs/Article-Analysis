GANGTOK: Former India football captain Bhaichung  , who unsuccessfully contested as Trinamool Congress candidate from   (2014) and   assembly constituencies (2016), is likely to quit   politics soon.

 The Tinkitam, South Sikkim-born footballer could get politically involved in his home state in the ensuing assembly elections.
 
 A close aide of Bhaichung said he had gradually drifted from Trinamool over the Mamata Banerjee government’s measures adopted to handle the 104-day Gorkhaland agitation last year in Darjeeling hills. “After lives were lost in the agitation, Bhaichung had been very unhappy. He also felt Sikkim MPs did not do much and did not speak about the issue in Parliament when some other parties did,” the aide added.
 
 It would be interesting to see the next political step or territory of the 41-year-old.
 
 Trinamool national spokesperson Derek O’Brien, however, refused to comment on the matter. But a senior party leader said: “We have spoken to Bhaichung. He has assured us he is not joining any political party. However, he has expressed his willingness to be part of a larger political platform. There are no hard feelings from our end.”
 
 Towards the end of 2017, speculation was rife in Sikkim that many of its political leaders were meeting Bhaichung. There was a demand from the people of his home state that the former footballer return and get politically involved for Sikkim’s betterment, sources said.
