When we contacted Anupama, she confirmed the news saying, 'I am not part of the Ram Charan film anymore. The formalities for the project were over and that's when I had announced the news via my social media account. However, I recently got a call and was told that I am not part of it. I am not aware of the reason, but it is their discretion.'
 
 According to sources from the industry, the crew of the Sukumar film is keen to add a lot more 'glamour' to the cast, which resulted in Anupama being dropped. 'The team wants to sign a commercial heroine who can bring on a lot more of the glam factor to the project. As of now, Anupama doesn't suit the bill for the same, which is why she wouldn't be acting in it.'
 
 Meanwhile, the actress is quite busy with other projects from various South industries and recently two of her films hit the screen.
