MEERUT: Nearly a year after fruits – under the ambitious one-fruit-per-week initiative in mid-day meal scheme – disappeared from the plates of over 1 crore school students in the state due to lack of funds, the UP government has released a grant of around Rs 167 crore for the same.
 
  It may be noted that the government had estimated a cost of Rs 4/child per week for the initiative. “An amount of Rs 166.83 crore has been released for the one-fruit-per-week scheme as part of mid-day meals for government school students in the state. This money should be strictly used only for the fruit scheme and if any money is left at the end of financial year 2017-18, it should be deposited in the government treasury,” read the order issued by  , UP special secretary.
  
    had reported in October last year that due to a “technical glitch", the fund for fruit had disappeared after the Budget was announced and the Rs 66 crore released in May 2017 could not be withdrawn by mid-day meal authorities for some reason. Even though teachers across the state had tried to arrange funds from their own pockets for some time, that also stopped as there was no further communication from the government.
  
  Uttar Pradesh Mid-day Meal Authority’s chief accounts officer   had told TOI in October last year: “Earlier, the government had sanctioned a budget of Rs 200 crore, out of which Rs 66 crore was released in May. But after the general budget was announced in July, the head of the fruit budget disappeared from the documents due to some technical reasons.” It was after TOI’s report in October that the state government issued a fresh set of instructions in November to begin the fruit distribution scheme “without any change”.
  
  “The funds released will be used to pay off the teachers who had spent for the scheme from their own pockets and for fruit distribution in March,” said Virendra Kumar, Meerut divisional mid-day meal coordinator.
