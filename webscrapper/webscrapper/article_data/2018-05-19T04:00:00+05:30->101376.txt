Ahmedabad: The directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) busted a racket smuggling high-speed diesel from the UAE to Kandla in Kutch and seized diesel worth Rs 26 crore at Kandla port, agency officials said on Friday.

 DRI Ahmedabad received specific intelligence that diesel was being smuggled in by a vessel named Al Heera, which was sailing from UAE to Kandla by falsely declaring the item as “Base Oil SN 50” in shipping documents. Discreet watch was kept at Kandla and as soon as the vessel berthed at the oil jetty, officials boarded it and took samples from each of its 10 tanks. These were tested at a government laboratory and the results confirmed the product to be high-speed diesel.
 
 “High-speed diesel is a restricted item which can be imported only by state trading enterprises. No private person is allowed to import it. Import is allowed only through the Indian Oil Corporation, subject to Foreign Trade Policy norms. Other oil marketing companies who have been granted rights to market transportation fuels through the ministry of petroleum and natural gas’s resolution of the year 2002. These companies include Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and IBP,” said a DRI official.
 
 “The shipload of high-speed diesel imported on the vessel Al Heera and that wasw falsely declared as Base Oil SN 50, valued at Rs 26,40,42,565 for a total quantity of 5,521.797 MT, was seized,” added the official.
 
 The duty computed by importers on Base Oil SN 50 as declared in the bills of entry filed was just Rs 6.46 crore, while the duty payable on high-speed diesel is around Rs 11 crore. Hence, besides attempting to import the restricted item privately by a false declaration, the importers had also attempted to evade duty to the tune of Rs 4.5 crore.
