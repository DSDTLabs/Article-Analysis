Nagpur: Two cases of international trafficking registered at Sakkardara police station, and another of Rachna Tarale, who claimed her two-and-a-half-month-old son was sold by her husband, were presented before State Women’s Commission president Vijaya Rahatkar. A team led by veteran journalist-cum-activist Umesh Choubey and team member Sunita Thakre presented the cases at Ravi Bhavan on Sunday. In all three cases, Rahatkar is learnt to have issued crucial instructions to the city police.

 Rahatkar told the media later that she would take up the case with the embassy of Saudi Arabia to bring back one of the victims still stuck in that country as a slave, referring to one of the cases presented before her. “One of the women has managed to return, but we would help the other one to come back from Saudi Arabia,” she said, referring to the two cases at Sakkardara police station.
 
 Interestingly, cops have reportedly not made any efforts to get to the root of the crime. “We would also ensure that the police make the pending arrests in the cases to ensure the rackets are busted. I shall speak to the commissioner of police regarding the action required to be taken,” she said.
 
 As Sakkardara cops are reluctant to arrest the accused in one of the cases, citing illness of the accused, Rahatkar is learnt to have advised cops to take stern in such matters.
 
 Thakre, who also brought the victims and their kin along, said Rahatkar was quick to suggest that police should take necessary action in Tarale’s case too.
