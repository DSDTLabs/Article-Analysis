Balance is a myth. As an entrepreneur, who’s also a mom, friend, daughter… I think we tend to put too much pressure on ourselves. Balancing family and entrepreneurship is hard. I chose to live as close as possible to my nearest family. To find reliable domestic staff, I approached my extended network of friends. And I traded off putting my kids to bed, with spending time with them in the morning and making sure I’m dropping them to school. I am blessed with a highly supportive partner, parents and in-laws for which I am grateful.
 
 
 
 The busy woman’s guide to fitness is pretty much the same as her approach to work – get it done. Once it has been put on the agenda, you find a way to squeeze it in.

 Navigating a business in a VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) environment, means you have to have a system. The beginning is always by accepting that we messed up. There is no place like a start-up to hone your fighter gene, and make yourself fit for life. Failures, setbacks and fight-backs, these are all part of the game. A fundamental rule our team follows is not to let creativity be killed in a crisis.
