NEW DELHI: With   for general category having ended,   have started   and   to prepare for the  . After seeing a rush on the last day, some schools had to extend the deadline and keep online portals open a little longer.

 The Indian School recorded around 3,000 submissions for around 150 seats in the open category. Principal Tania Joshi said some parents took forms at 11am, the deadline set by the school, because of which the submission time was extended by 40 minutes. “We later put a cardboard box near the gate and deployed teachers and administrative staff for parents who still wanted to submit last minute details,” she added, calling the last day “maddening”.
 
 Sardar Patel Vidyalaya saw 20% more applications this year for around 40 open seats. The deadline for submitting the forms was 4pm. “We saw a few payments being made even at that time, so we allowed parents to fill the form first and then make the payment,” said principal Anuradha Joshi.
 
 Similarly, schools like DPS Mathura Road and Springdales Pusa Road also saw robust submissions on the last day.
 
 With the first list slated for February 15, schools are going to start the process of verification of forms. The documents will be verified after the first list. Principals said that as a large number of applications have been received, the draw is going to be on a large scale.
 
 The principals also pointed out that mechanisms have been put in place for parents to make corrections to forms in the next few days. The Indian School will accept copies of documents from parents to make corrections. Similarly, DPS Mathura Road will have a round-the-clock helpline to assist parents. They will take correction applications through email, which will be made by the school administration.
