Kota: The accused of murder of mother-son duo in Bhimganj Mandi police station area of the city has not been traced so far even 24 hours after the crime was committed. Police investigation has zeroed in on the alleged lover of the deceased woman.

 Police have lodged a report under sections of IPC for murder and initiated investigation into the matter.
