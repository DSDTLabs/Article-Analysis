Tirupur: It is believed   can remove all obstacles in one’s life. But the question is: will a picture of the Lord on a   issued by a state government department remove obstacles or create more hindrances for the card holder?

 A picture of Lord Vinayaka's has appeared on a smart card issued by the   Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department to a resident of Udumalpet in   district.
 
 N Nallasivam of Vadugampalayam was surprised when he collected the smart card from a ration shop in the area on Friday last. Instead of his photo, he found Lord Vinayaka's picture on the smart card.
 
 On Monday, Nallasivam submitted the smart card to a civil supplies office in the area to get a new one carrying his photo.
 
 Recently, Saroja Periyathambi, a 64-year-old woman at Kaamalapuram in Salem district, found actress Kajal Aggarwal’s photo when she received her smart card from a ration shop in the area.
