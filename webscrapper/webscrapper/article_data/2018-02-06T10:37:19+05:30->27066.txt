NASHIK: A 51-km stretch of   road is set to become a four-lane route having a separate lane for pilgrims on foot with 'palkhis'. 

  Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has floated tenders to widen the 51-km stretch of NH-160 between Sinnar and Shirdi from the existing two lanes. It will be upgraded on design, build, operate and transfer (hybrid annuity) basis. The last date to file bids for the project is February 19. 
 
 This stretch of the highway is used by lakhs of devotees throughout the year. The officials have, therefore, included a separate lane for pilgrims on foot with 'palkhis' in the road widening plan. 
 
 According to NHAI sources, the project entails land acquisition in 19 villages in   and six in Ahmednagar district. "The joint measurement for identifying the land that would be acquired has been completed in 16 villages. The exercise is on in the remaining villages," said NHAI officials. 
 
 Sources from the district administration said the authorities are facing resistance in five villages from Nashik to the joint measurement exercise. In Ahmednagar, three villages are opposing the exercise. 
 
 Officials said that the work of road widening can be started before the onset of monsoon only if the land acquisition process in completed before March this year. 
 
 In a statement issued in the   website on February 2, NHAI has provided details of the bids that it has floated for different road projects across the country. The Sinnar-Shirdi stretch is one of the projects mentioned in the statement.
 
 Last month, chief minister   had directed the Nashik district administration to speed up the land acquisition process.
