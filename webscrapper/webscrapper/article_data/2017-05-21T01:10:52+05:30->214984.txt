Lucknow: After the director, the state government has sacked the   of Institute of Engineering and Technology, a constituent college of APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University. The university has appointed Prof AK Katiyar from the department of applied sciences of the college as registrar. Barely four days ago, the government had restricted   director Prof AS   from discharging his duties. 

 On Friday, the university had removed officiating registrar of IET Tanvir Tahir. Tahir, states the government order issued by special secretary Abrar Ahmed, was removed for his lackadaisical attitude. The university’s executive council on April 10 had recommended Tahir’s removal due to his callous attitude and had suggested a senior professor be appointed in his place.
