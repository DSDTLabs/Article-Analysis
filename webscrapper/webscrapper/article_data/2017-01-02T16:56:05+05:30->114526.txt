CHENNAI: The   has changed the dismissal order of an assistant executive engineer with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to compulsory retirement.

 On the basis of a complaint, a trap was laid for   on September 5, 2000 and he was allegedly caught accepting a bribe. 
 
 He was placed under suspension from December 2003. After a trial court convicted him, TNEB dismissed him from service on May 9, 2005. Sivaguru moved the Madras high court against the conviction and was acquitted of the criminal charges in 2015.
 
 Sivaguru then filed an appeal against the dismissal appeal against the dismissal order. He said the departmental proceedings were flawed since, although the criminal case against him was initially proved, he was later exonerated of the charges and acquitted by the high court.
 
 Justice R Suresh Kumar said one could not find fault with TNEB for initiating departmental proceedings against Sivaguru as it had acted on specific complaints and after finding him guilty , dismissed from service. But this was before the court quashed the charges against him. The single judge's verdict, while acquitting him, had highlighted that the complainant in the trap proceedings was an “interested person.“
 
 The demand and acceptance of bribe were also not proved.
 
 “When there is a categorical finding ... by the court ... , the same can be pressed in the present case where he is challenging the departmental proceedings and its ultimate order of dismissal,“ said the judge adding that leniency should be shown to Sivaguru as he had served the board from 1967 to May 2005 without any blemish. He had in fact been “honourably acquitted,“ said Justice Kumar.
 
 The judge then directed the TNEB to modify the dismissal to compulsory retirement along with paying all service benefits, according to the relevant rules of the department, to Sivaguru.
