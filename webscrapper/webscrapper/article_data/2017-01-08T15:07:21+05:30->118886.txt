Singer   says that he wrote half his brand new track ' ' while keeping   in mind. 

  
  
 The 25-year-old singing sensation, who returned to the   scene after a gap of a year, revealed that he debated handing his bouncy new tune over to Rihanna after he was done writing it.
 
 "('Shape of You') is actually a really random one because I went in to write songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid, and we were writing this song and I was like 'this would really work for Rihanna'," he said. 
 
 "But then I started singing lyrics like putting 'Van The Man on the jukebox' and I was like well, 'She's not really going to sing that, is she?' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to make it for me."
