Hyderabad: The Hyderabad   on Thursday found fault with the Andhra Pradesh government for framing its school textbook printing tender conditions in a way that eliminated printers and publishers from Hyderabad.

 Dealing with a petition filed by Telangana Web Offset Printers Association, which felt aggrieved by the elimination of Telangana printers, a bench of Justices V Ramasubrahmanian and J Uma Devi directed the AP government and its school education department to allow the printers in the city to take part in the tender process. 
 
 The final result of the tender process will be subject to the adjudication of this plea.
 
 Dipak Bhattacharji, the counsel for the association, told the bench that it was unfair on the part of AP to sideline Hyderabad printers despite the fact that the city is the common capital for AP and Telangana for the next seven years. The bench posted the case to February 27. tnn
