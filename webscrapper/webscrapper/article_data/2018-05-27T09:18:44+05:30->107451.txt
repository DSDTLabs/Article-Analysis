LUCKNOW: Economics turned out to be a ‘marks earner’ for   class XII students who feel that the reexam gave them a chance to score a perfect 100 in the subject. The examination was cancelled by the CBSE and was re-conducted on April 25 after reports of an alleged paper leak surfaced on March 28.

 
 Students said that initially, they were upset when the exam was cancelled but an easy paper the second time elevated their expectations of better marks.
 
 “The difficulty level was reduced when the exam was held again. The first paper was too lengthy and many of us couldn’t attempt the full paper, but it was not so the second time. I scrolled my scorecard thrice to recheck that it was a perfect 100 in the subject,” said Pragun Agarwal of Delhi Public School, Indiranagar who scored 94% overall.
 
  of   shared that the re-exam was like a second chance to make up for the mistakes made in the first attempt. “I was expecting more than 95, but a perfect 100 has turned out to be a bonus for me. It was stressful to take the same examination the second time, but preparing and revising all concepts again helped in scoring better,” said Aditi, who scored 96% overall.
 
 From the same school,   said that once the examination was cancelled, students were scared that the re-exam and marking would be tough. “Usually, if an examination is cancelled due to paper leak the next one is set tougher by the paper setters, thank god it was not so in our case.”
 
 Students said taking the exam again helped them understand how their knowledge will be tested.
