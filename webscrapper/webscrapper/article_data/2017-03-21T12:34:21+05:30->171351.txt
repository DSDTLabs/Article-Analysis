CHANDIGARH: Cash-strapped municipal corporation (MC) in its house meeting on Monday unanimously resolved to levy   on commercial vehicles entering the city in a bid to improve revenue generation.

 The civic body is working out modalities on pattern of the Delhi MC. The tax ranges between Rs 100 (taxi and other commercial vehicles) to Rs 800 (10-wheel trucks). The house, however, exempted ambulance, fire tenders, police and government vehicles.
 
 According to the proposal, the MC would construct booths\barriers at the entry points for tax collection. It would also deploy squads to keep a check on evaders.
 
 Before starting the discussion, MC commissioner   told the house of poor financial position of the corporation, which heavily depends on grant from the UT administration.
 
 For the next financial year, the administration has allocated grant in-aid of Rs 419 crore to the MC. Of the total amount, Rs 100 crore is for smart city project and Rs 50 crore for Kajauli water works. Around Rs 300 crore will account for salaries, leaving a deficit of around Rs 30 crore. The corporation earns revenue of around Rs 120 crore. The per capita expenditure of Chandigarh MC is Rs 5,381, of which proportion of own revenue to total expenditure is only 29 percent.
 
 “The MC does not have sufficient to carry out development works. There is no option but to improve revenue generation of the corporation,” said Purushartha.
 
 While supporting contention of MC commissioner, former Mayor and senior   councillor   said time has come to take tough decision with an aim to generate funds which can be used for the welfare of city residents.
