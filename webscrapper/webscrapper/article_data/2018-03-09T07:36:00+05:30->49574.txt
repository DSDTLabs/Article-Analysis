CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   has said that a meeting would be held between Haryana and Uttar Pradesh officials next month to resolve various issues concerning irrigation.
 
 Replying to the debate on the governor’s address on the fourth day of the budget session of the Haryana assembly on Thursday, he said the demand would be raised at the meeting for giving control of part of the Agra Canal, which fell in Haryana, for the purpose of cleanliness so that the farmers could get their allocated share of water from the canal.
 
 About 100km stretch of the Agra canal falls in Haryana and the farmers in various parts of southern Haryana get water from various channels which emanate from the river. At present, Haryana has to take no objection certificate ( ) from UP for cleaning the canal since its control rests with UP, the CM said.
 
 “During my visit to Barsana in UP recently, I had discussed with the UP CM Yogi Adityanath, various issues concerning inter-state border, law and order and irrigation. It was then principally decided that issues concerning both states would be mutually resolved,” CM said.
 
 In order to ensure that clean water flows in the Yamuna and all other rivers passing through the state, the central government has been requested to prepare a plan on the pattern of the ‘Namami Gange’ project implemented to clean and protect the Ganga.
