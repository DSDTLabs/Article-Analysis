PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa reduced the jail term of an accused in a case of drug possession from 12 years to four years and eight months after it was found that the chemical analyser weighed the seized contraband along with its polythene cover.

 
 
  
  
 
 The high court held that the weight of the polythene cover cannot be taken into consideration while ascertaining the weight of the contraband to see whether it is a case of possession under commercial category. The court further directed that the appellant suffer imprisonment for the period already undergone and pay a fine of Rs 50,000.
 
 The high court noted that the powder tested positive for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy, and sentenced the accused to imprisonment for four years and eight months, already spent by him in jail.
 
 MDMA weighing 10g and above is considered commercial quantity. If the weight is restricted to 0.5g, it qualifies as small quantity, while anything in excess of 0.5g but lesser than 10g is considered variable/intermediate quantity by law.
 
 Holding that there was a lapse on part of the chemical analyser in obtaining the weight of the contraband, Justice C V   remarked, “No attempt was made by the prosecution to place on record the weight of the contraband separately. There was also no attempt made to get this clarified.”
 
 The prosecution had claimed that the accused, Caitan  , was found in illegal possession of 15.6g of MDMA at   in 2013. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 12 years and fined Rs 1.5 lakh by a trial court.
 
 Fernandes challenged the sentence in the high court, where, his lawyer, Jos Peter D’Souza, argued that his client should get the benefit of doubt as there was no clarity as to whether the amount of contraband in his possession was of commercial quantity.
