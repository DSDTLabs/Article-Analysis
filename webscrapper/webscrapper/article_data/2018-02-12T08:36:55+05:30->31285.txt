LUCKNOW: The UP government’s policy of zero tolerance to   in the ongoing state   seems to have paid off, not only deterring lakhs of students who hoped to sail through via different means of cheating but also inspiring many to study better.

 Class X student Nirmal Kumar* of Muzaffarnagar said, “A coaching centre... had promised me 100% success by helping me cheat. But since   cameras were set up at all the exam centres, the coaching centre operators backed out and I decided to skip the exams. I hope things aren’t this strict next year.”
