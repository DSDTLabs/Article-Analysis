PATNA: The state   will conduct monthlong activities from June 1 to mark   under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme ( ) of the ministry of health and family welfare.

 
 June is observed as   month when people are taught how to prevent breeding of mosquitoes by not allowing water to stagnate.
 
 Talking to this newspaper on Thursday, district   officer (Patna) Shambhu Sharan Singh said, “During monsoon and post-monsoon phases, the risk of malaria is high. We will carry out several activities during the month to create public awareness and promote methods like waste management in the immediate surroundings as well as prevention of water stagnation.”
 
 Elaborating on the various activities to be taken up, Singh said, “A five-member team of malaria inspectors and diagnostic experts will organize camps and workshops in the 23 blocks of Patna to make people aware about vector-borne diseases. There will interactive sessions and live demonstrations, apart from free tests and distribution of anti-malarial drugs. In high-risk areas, we will use methods like fogging.”
 
 Last year, during the monthlong campaign, only four cases of malaria were reported in Patna. Of these, three were of plasmodium vivax (Pv) and one was of plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Pf type in humans causes the most acute form of the disease. However, ps type can be cured easily.
 
 Meanwhile, the civic body claims to have intensified preventive measures such as fumigation and fogging. “Fogging is being carried out in most drains in the congested localities and on city roads. We have also deputed staff for spraying larvicide in stored water containers like overhead tanks. More than half of the work is complete,” said Patna mayor Sita Sahu.
