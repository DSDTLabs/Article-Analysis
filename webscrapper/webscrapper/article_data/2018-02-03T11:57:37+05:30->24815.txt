PUNE: Born with ocular albinism, a genetic condition that causes poor vision and absence of pigment in the skin, Kinjal Popat can study for only about 2-3 hours a day before her eyes get tired. Despite the overwhelming struggle, the 20-year-old cleared the CA-CPT exam last month, taking the first step towards becoming a Chartered Accountant.

 Hailing from Chikhli in Buldhana district, Kinjal would travel 25km one way to reach her school every day. “My parents own a grocery store. They wanted me to get a good education so they sent me to an English medium school in Buldhana,” said Kinjal who is a second year student at the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC).
 
 However, with no pigmentation on her skin or hair and poor vision, life has always been a struggle for the young girl. “I wasn’t allowed to watch TV so I sat in my father’s shop. This made me take an interest in business,” said Kinjal.
 
 The young girl soon developed an interest in  . “I started coaching for CA with Shishir Puranik. Studying was a bit tough as I could only read up to 2-3 hours continuously in a day. My eyes would tire and then I would need to sleep,” said Kinjal, who has a younger sister in school back home.
 
 “She is a hardworking student. I was overwhelmed by Kinjal’s tenacity to learn accountancy and I’ve been guiding her since. She did very well in her secondary school certificate (SSC, std X) board exams despite her condition,” said Puranik, her coach and mentor.
 
 Kinjal feels that anybody can excel if they stop pitying themselves and make an effort to achieve their goal. “I think that while society sympathizes with those who have a handicap, disabled people themselves sometimes feel powerless and get comfortable with the pity they receive. We have to understand that life is a struggle and only hard work can save us no matter who we are,” said Kinjal who is now preparing for the remaining CA exams.
