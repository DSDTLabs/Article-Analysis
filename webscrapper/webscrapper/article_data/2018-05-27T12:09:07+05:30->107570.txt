TRICHY: The Tamil Nadu government was imposing prohibitory orders in   in order to conceal the number of deaths and people injured during the police firing, president of Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam John Pandian said. He urged that the officials who ordered police firing should be booked and executed.

 Addressing reporters here on Saturday, he said that the district administration and the police knew that there were a large number of protesters coming in. But, both didn’t take proper measures to avert any eventualities. Police firing was a pre-planned murder, as all the victims received bullets on their head and chest, he alleged.
 
 “Ordering a one-man commission to probe the incident is deceptive, as it would bear nothing. While the protesters were from all religions, the   accused the people of a particular religion,” he said.
 
 Even after the police firing, Chief Minister   keeps on lying only to safeguard his chair. The   government should take the responsibility for the firing incident, Pandian said.
