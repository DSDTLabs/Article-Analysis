BAREILLY: Next time you call the Baradari or   with a complaint, you might be greeted with a popular Bollywood love song instead of the obsolete ringing of landline phones. Officials at both stations were as surprised as distraught callers, with the former saying they have no idea who had set these caller tunes. 

 Notably, state chief minister   had showered lavish praise on the state cops two days ago for their efficient services when he was in the city.
 
 While a caller heard the popular song '
 ' at the other end of the phone, he dismissed it as a wrong number. Another had to listen to '
 ' before a staff decided to answer the phone. 
 
 "There is no provision through which we can put our requests for caller tunes services. I am not sure how it was activated," said Satyendra Pawar, station office of Cantonment station.
 
 The landline phones are mostly used for intradepartmental purposes since most people dial 100 or contact the respective mobile numbers of station in-charges during emergency. Besides, all station officers and other senior officials of the police department have been given closed used group (CUG) mobile numbers. It is only the clerks and other staff members who operate the landline numbers at the stations. 
 
 "Most of cops would not know that a Bollywood track is being played as the caller tune because there is hardly any feedback about it from anyone," said an official at the Baradari police station, who did not wish to be named.
 
 Residents, in the meanwhile, were amused at the development even as they unequivocally criticized it. "This is bizarre. Having a caller tune is not a crime but a person would usually be calling at a time of emergency. At a time like that, no one would like to hear a Bollywood love song," said Vandana, a professor at a Bareilly college, who only goes by her first name.
