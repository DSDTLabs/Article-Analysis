Kolkata: The Left debacle in Tripura hung heavy on the inaugural session of CPM’s West Bengal state conference on Monday, taking off the steam it was gathering since the party’s central committee voted out the tactical line of having an understanding with Congress and other secular parties in the battle against BJP.

 CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Bengal state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra didn’t cross the CC lakhshman rekha while placing their views in the conference. “The question will be debated in the Party Congress. You are free to send amendments to the draft political resolution,” the CPM general secretary said. Prakash Karat and politburo member Brinda Karat are attending the meet.
 
 Ailing former CM and CPM central committee member Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has told that he doesn’t want to continue in party committees — central committee and state committee — any longer. He joined the conference on Monday in the second half.
