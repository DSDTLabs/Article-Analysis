NAGPUR: The deadline for   (RTE)   has been extended till March 2, from the previous February 25.  , coordinator of   (SSA) who is looking after the process in district said, “We have received a tremendous response with applications touching almost 21,000. That’s a huge jump from last year’s 13,639.” 

 With the deadline being extended till March 2 it is expected, if things continue at the same speed, that the applications will cross the 30,000 mark. This will also mean a tough competition among students for the free seats considering there are only 7,102 available in the district.
