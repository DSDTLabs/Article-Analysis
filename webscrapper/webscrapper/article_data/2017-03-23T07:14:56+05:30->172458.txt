BENGALURU: The   (CBD) will get an additional 679   by the end of next month, taking the number of cameras manning the area from 329 to a whopping 1,008. Of the 329 already installed, 150 are dedicated for law and order and 179 to keep an eye on traffic.

 Police commissioner   said of the new 679 cameras, 579 will be for law and order and 100 for traffic. The cameras, in addition to the ones already installed at major traffic signals, lanes and junctions, will boost security in CBD. They will help police keep an eye on untoward situations such as road rage, riot or traffic jam. A 20x30 video wall will be installed at the command centre öf the police commissioner’s office and CCTV cameras will be linked to it, Sood explained.
 
 Traffic police are already manning CBD through a huge video wall at the   in  . “We have plans to bring traffic cops and their law and order counterparts together during emergencies such as mob violence or a protest march that may turn into a riot. Also, we shall have direct communication with district control rooms in future,” said a police officer.
 
 Senior officers, however, say staff at the command centre should be properly trained to handle emergency situations. “It’s not an easy job. Alerts during emergencies related to law and order and traffic will come every minute and staff sitting at the centre must know when to pass the information and to whom. The initial days of the Traffic Management Centre had seen problems owing to lack of coordination between ground-level cops and their seniors,” the officer pointed out.
