 was the star attraction on Day 2 of the leadership summit held at the   here on Sunday. Talking about his journey as a sports entrepreneur, he said “We all have a latent desire to run a team the way we want to. As fans, we don’t just watch the sport, we get into every little detail of the game. For me too, it started the same way,” he said adding, “ I was a basketball player, ski and a high jumper. There’s a basketball court in every school and college, but everyone ends up playing cricket in the court. Since then I had this desire to popularise sports that are not so popular.”

 Explaining why he chose to venture into kabaddi of all sports, Abhishek said, “I knew I had to start with any sport but cricket, because the scene in cricket is pretty sorted. I wanted to take up a sport where I could make a difference. It was   who suggested that I take up kabaddi (he owns a team in the  ). When I started doing research about the sport, I was blown away. It was then I decided to take up kabaddi. There’s a stigma that kabaddi is a rural sport, but that’s not true. The word kabaddi is a derivative of a Tamil word. It’s the state sport of Kerala. More countries play kabaddi than cricket. It’s indigenous, and is around 4,000-5,000 years old. Its origin lies in the Mahabharata.”
 
 He further talked about the future of sports in India, and how these leagues are doing a world of good to local talent, which wasn’t possible before. He even competed with his host to utter kabaddi at one go, and emerged victorious. When the session was thrown open to the audience, the actor obliged inquisitive Hyderabadis.
