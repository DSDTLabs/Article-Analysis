Ranchi: The   is set to get an image makeover and a boost in its infrastructure in the months to follow. 

 Officials of the Ranchi railway division of   (SER) are currently working on a blue-print for building a new façade of the station and its surface area development. 
 
 “We have received orders from the SER to undertake several new initiatives at the Ranchi station. The most important of them is the modernization of its façade and surface area development,” Ranchi divisional railway manager Vijay Kumar Gupta said. He also said the division was sanctioned Rs 20 crore for the project. 
 
 The division’s total revenue, including from freight and passenger earnings, stood at Rs 665 crore in the 2017-18 financial year. Though it hopes to generate better revenue in the new fiscal, the division announced that its primary focus will be on improving passenger amenities and infrastructure. 
 
 On the infrastructure front, the division is expected to install two new escalators at the station. 
 
 “The raising of heights of few platforms is on the cards. That apart, Hatia and Ranchi stations will be brought under the CCTV net by this year,” Gupta said. 
 
 The division will also switch over to LED lights completely in Ranchi and Hatia stations. The move will conserve 1 million electric units in one year. “With the transition to LED lights, electricity bills of the stations will be reduced by Rs 65 lakh on average,” an officer said.
 
 With the summers approaching, the division is also expected to begin construction of underground water tanks in Ranchi and Hatia stations for unhindered supply to the stations.
