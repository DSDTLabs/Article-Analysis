BHUBANESWAR: In  , god helps those who help themselves. The famous Sarala Temple in the district on Sunday announced that it will no longer accept offerings or pujas from bike-borne worshippers who ride up to the temple without helmets. 

 Upon every purchase of a vehicle or bike, it is almost a rite of passage to perform a puja for it. Many also take their vehicles to the temples for occasional pujas. Which is exactly where the road safety awareness initiative - the brainchild of the district police and the temple management - comes in. 
 
 "We were getting increasingly worried about the escalating number of road deaths that stemmed from the fact that bikers refuse to wear helmets. This new idea struck us and we shared it with the priests of the Sarala Temple," said Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police,  . 
 
 The temple readily agreed. Which meant that on Sunday -   - it refused as many as 20 helmetless bikers. "We will continue to extend our support to the police for their noble cause. We will simply not perform pujas of bikes whose riders come without helmets," said head priest Sudam Charan Panda. 
 
 The temple stands to make some financial loss in the process. "We do not mind that. People should realise that the helmet is a blessing and use it," Panda said.
 
 The temple gets its fair share of motorists - on an usual day the number of bikers touches 50. On festive occasions, there are as many as 100. 
 
 "While 111 persons had died in road accidents in Jagatsinghpur district in 2016, the casualty figure dropped to 96 in 2017. We can understand the drop is marginal. Our effort is to reduce the fatality rate by 50 per cent this year compared to last year. We will strictly enforce road safety rules and take on the violators," Pankaj said. 
 
 The district police had last year launched a 'no helmet, no petrol' campaign to sensitise bikers about the use of protective headgear. Petrol filling stations were asked to withhold service to helmetless bikers.
