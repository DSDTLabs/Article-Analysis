MANDYA:   workers took exception to a tweet from Ramya, the AICC’s  , and staged a protest against her, here on Monday. Taking a swipe at Modi for his comment at Sunday’s Parivarthana rally that farmers are his “TOP priority” — standing for “tomato, onion, potato” — Ramya had shot back on Twitter: “Is this what happens when you are on POT?”

 BJP workers congregated at   and shouted slogans against the actor-politician. They called her a “childish politician” and accused her of being ignorant of “basic politics and agricultural problems”.
 
 They also accused Ramya of “denigrating and mocking” the “well-acclaimed calibre and dignity of Modi”.
 
 “She used the word POT against our PM who has been winning minds and hearts across the globe and is considered an able and astute diplomat,” protesters said. “Modi said he would give top priority to these vegetable staples. Is Modi at fault for trying to improve the lives of farmers?”
 
 Protesters reminded Ramya about an incident where she was allegedly taken to task by some people in a   in Mandya, when she had attempted to criticize demonetization.
