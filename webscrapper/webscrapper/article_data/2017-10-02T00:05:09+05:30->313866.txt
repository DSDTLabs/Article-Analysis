Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh Directorate of Public Instructions (DPI) has directed the heads of all schools to take steps to keep the students away from the Blue Whale Game — which provokes players to commit suicide.

  To do so, DPI has prohibited use of mobile phones in all schools of the state. This rule covers the teachers as well. A letter was sent to all schools in this regard, asking the schools to sensitise the children about the fatal game by sharing the Blue Whale related accidents.
 
 “We have issued these directives in order to keep our children away from any link of such kind. We have to be vigilant in protecting our students,” said DPI commissioner, Neeraj Dubey.
 
 The directive reads that the Blue Whale Challenge is a game ‘started by criminal-mined people in which children get involved and find it difficult to escape it. In few cases, children have even attempted suicide’.
 
 It also states that the mobile phones have been prohibited due to the radiation and adverse effects on the innocent mind of the children
 
 “It is the teachers’ responsibility to advise children against the use of mobile phones, and if they find the link of the game in any phone, they should take measures to get it removed effectively. Teachers should avoid using smartphones in front of schoolchildren to discourage its use,” the letter read.
 
 Teachers and parents should be vigilant at all times, it adds. The letter has also been issued to Rajya Shiksha Kendra to be implemented in primary and middle schools.
 
 The Blue Whale Challenge is a suicide game in which the players are given certain tasks to complete over a period of 50 days with the final task being suicide.
