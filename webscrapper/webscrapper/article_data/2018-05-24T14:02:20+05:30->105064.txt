SURAT:  ,  , are being reconstructed across the city. These buildings,  , needed a major overhaul. Permissions for their reconstruction given with additional FSI under the new provisions of General Development Control Regulations (GDCR). 

 Last week, Adeswar Apartment had collapsed while it was being brought down. The structure of the apartment block had become weak. Fortunately, no life was lost in the accident. 
 
 Dr Atul Desai, professor at Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), told TOI, “The city receives at least four seismic shocks daily. Corrosion and cracks in the beams and columns because of water seepage, slabs made on black soil and use of saline water during construction make the buildings weak over a period of time.”
 
 A SVNIT team consisting of three department professors has been authorized to advise the authorities on structural stability of buildings. The team had recently advised on the demolition of the Surat court building.
 
 Owners of the old dilapidated buildings are able to get permission for reconstruction under the new provisions of GDCR with higher FSI. “Many apartment owners are coming for permission for reconstruction. They get advantage of bigger flats by paying for additional FSI and are also allowed to build parking facilities underground. Conversion of a residential society into a commercial complex is also possible,” said an officer of the town-planning department.
 
 “We had applied earlier for redevelopment permission under rule 29(A) and our file is still pending in Gandhinagar for past three years. However, we have got permission to build a new apartment with additional FSI from the Surat Municipal Corporation within few months under the new provisions of GDCR,” said Haresh Pandya, resident of an apartment in the city.
