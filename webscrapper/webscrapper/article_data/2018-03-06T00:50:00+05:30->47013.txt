Madurai: The city corporation is planning to start a special   at Government Rajaji Hospital to accommodate the attendants of critical care patients. These homes would have facilities like potable drinking water as well as food and locker facilities.

 The building for this purpose is being constructed inside the enclosure of the Institute of Child Health and Research Centre in front of Amma Canteen on the vast GRH campus. The concrete roofing work for the spacious building is complete and it is expected to be thrown open soon. The facility can accommodate 35 people at a time. 
 
 At least 500 patients are under critical care treatment at any given point of time in the GRH. While the presence of attendants is necessary, they are not allowed to stay with the patients or nearby. Hospital authorities point out that many of the patients come from other districts including faraway places like Ramanathapuram. 
 
 Health officials from the corporation said that the attendants were at present staying at various places inside the hospital premises. As most of them would be from poor background, they could not even afford to have food in the hotels outside. Moreover, the facility would be of great help to women whose children were being treated in the paediatric department. The facility would help them get a decent stay and security until their loved ones got discharged from the hospital. 
 
 Another health official also said that homes for the destitute had been a key focus for them for a while now. At present, eight such homes were being run by the corporation and they had set themselves a target of expanding them to 15 in the near future. Though the civic body evinces keen interest in opening destitute homes, the difficulty has been in finding suitable places, the official added.
