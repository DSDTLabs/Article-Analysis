HYDERABAD: An ongoing probe into the   the needle of suspicion towards a bunch of  , who could have possibly carried out the surgeries without supervision, leading to heavy blood loss. Five pregnant women who underwent   died at the state-run facility between January 28 and February 4.

 After   and families alleged that the surgeries were carried out by post-graduate (PG) medical students without any supervision, authorities said they are verifying these allegations apart from probing whether contaminated blood supplied to the hospital could have caused the deaths.
 
 Hyderabad district collector Rahul Bojja, who is heading the inspection, told TOI that he was “not ruling out such an incident,“ but would wait for an official report to be filed. “We have sent out samples of blood given to the victims for testing,“ Bojja said.
 
 Mujtaba Hasan Askari, founder, NGO Helping Hand Foundation, said senior doctors from the hospital revealed that the surgeries were taken up by PG students, without any supervision. “They also revealed that the students panicked when the patients bled post surgery, which prompted them to ask the kin of the patients to run around for more blood,“ Askari said.
 
 What could have also worsened their condition was untested blood administered on patients from a private blood bank. “The hospital does not have a blood component separation centre,“ Askari said. The blood could have triggered an outbreak of Antibody-Mediated Rejection, which is why the patients did not react to the medication given to them after that, a doctor at the hospital said on condition of anonymity .
 
 Dr M Ramani, director of medical education, said that possibility of a surgery conducted by PG students without supervision by a senior doctor was remote. “There is always a professor present in the theatre,“ Ramani added.
