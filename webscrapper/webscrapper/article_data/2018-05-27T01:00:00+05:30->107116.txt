Be it the ice bucket challenge, the Kylie Jenner lip challenge or the mannequin challenge, numerous challenges have gone viral on social media over the last few years. Now, closer home, it is the #HumFitTohIndiaFit challenge, initiated by Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Youth Affairs And Sports,  , that has caught the attention of young India. The minister, also an Olympic medallist, recently posted a video of him doing push-ups in his office. He urged people to post pictures and videos of how they keep themselves fit and send a   challenge to their friends on social media.

 The minister also challenged cricketer  , actor  , and badminton player   to join in – all of them have happily accepted the challenge. And now, it seems that it has struck the right chord with Bareillywallahs, who have been sharing their workout videos on social media and challenging their friends to do the same.
