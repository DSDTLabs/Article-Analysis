JAIPUR: The city police investigating the   in which a father and his son were killed by   on Wednesday said that   of the 35-year-old man could be the reason behind the murder. Police were looking for a maid who used to come to prepare lunch and dinner for father and son to get further clues to solve the  .

 “We have located some of the cell numbers that belonged to the deceased father and son. One of the mobile phone that belonged to Saurabh Saxena(35) is missing from the house,“ said police.
 
 Police have also found some condoms in the house and some clues that suggested that Saurabh was into illicit relations after his divorce six months ago.
 
 “There could be a possibility that the maid and Saurabh had illicit relations which were later known to the maid's husband. Thus, maid's husband along with her might have killed Saurabh and while the father came to resist he too was eliminated,“ said a senior officer.
 
 When contacted Prafful Kumar, additional commissioner of police (Crime), said, “Nothing is conclusive. We are looking for the maid who used to work earlier in this house. Her questioning will further clear the mystery.“
 
 Police while quoting some neighbours said that the victim Saurabh and his father were not very social and were self-centric. “There are unconfirmed reports that some women were regular in this house. The way Saurabh's both hands were tied by the rope from the front gives clear indication that it was not murder for gain but was a murder for some revenge.Somebody wanted to teach the victim a lesson,“ a senior officer on the condition of anonymity said.
