LUCKNOW: The occupant of the once famous address in the state capital – house number 92/98-1 located in Basmandi area under Babu Banarasai Das Ward –   is out of the voter list of the local civic body.

 The former Prime Minister is no longer on the voter list of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC). The reason being cited, he has not been staying here for the last several years. 
 
 Zonal officer of the LMC-Zone 1, Ashok  , said on Wednesday, "Vajpayee, who once coined the slogan Pehle Matdaan Phir Jalpaan (loosely translated 'First vote, then have breakfast') – has been removed from the voter list after the latest (voter list) campaign. The house in the three-storey Rajendra Smriti Bhavan beside Mohan Hotel is now the office of the Kisan Sangh." 
 
 Vajpayee, whose voter number was 1054, had last cast his vote in the civic body polls in 2000. The ailing former PM has not exercised his franchise after 2004   elections. 
 
 
 
 
 Vajpayee had been an MP for the 1999-2004 term. The veteran BJP leader, who had last cast his vote in the 2004 LS polls in the capital, used to visit the poll booth at the civic body to cast votes in the LS and municipal election. He had also campaigned for deputy CM Dinesh Sharma in the 2006 mayoral poll. 
 
 
 
 
 Vajpayee, who now stays at 6-A in Lutyen’s Zone in the national capital, has not been keeping well and hardly meets anyone. However, senior BJP leaders such as LK   and   do visit him occasionally.
