PANAJI: Leader of the opposition Chandrakant   has demanded a roll back of the power tariff hike which came into effect from April 1.

 Slamming the government for increasing the power tariff, including that of domestic consumers, by 11%, Kavlekar said this only shows its insensitivity.
 
 In a statement, Kavlekar said that starting with the demonetisation, the implementation of GST, rise in prices of basic commodities, high unemployment and closure of mining, the common man has already been burdened. However, instead of providing relief, the government has gone and hiked power tariffs. It’s not the first time that power tarrifs have been increased during the tenure of this government. This clearly indicates their failure to serve the basic needs of people, he said. 
 
 “The vision of 24x7 power supply looks like a blur. There are various complaints of power failure, thus inconveniencing people, specially students,” Kavlekar said.
