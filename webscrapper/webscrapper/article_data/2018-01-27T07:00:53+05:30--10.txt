HYDERABAD:   literary great Kadir  , who passed away recently, had produced several works in Urdu and English. 

 Besides being an eminent advocate and civil activist, he served as member of the general council of Sahitya Akademi. He was also founder-member of Qadir Ali Baig Theatre Foundation.
 
 Kadir was a story writer, playwright, essayist and translator. His original works included 'The Man and the Parrot'- a collection of short plays; 'Langda Ghodaa'; and 'Open Book', a compilation of short stories, plays and articles. He had several publications on legal studies. His plays were broadcast on radio.

"A gem of person and someone who cherished relationships without any personal agenda. It was a privileged learning experience that I will treasure. I remember he flew on his own to Mumbai to give us a surprise when 'Quli: Dilon ka Shahzaada' was opening the NCPA Festival," says Mohammad Ali Baig, director, Qadir Ali Baig Theatre Foundation.
