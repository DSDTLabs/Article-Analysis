HYDERABAD: Adding to the   is the rapid reduction in   in the city. Between 2012 and now, the average road space available for vehicles has shrunk from an already poor 9% to 8.32%, reveals official data. “This is far less than the road space available in most metro cities,” said M Narsing Rao, inspector,  , adding: “The minimum road space required for a city is at least 12%.” 

 If the ever increasing number of   eating into the road space wasn’t enough, the ongoing metro works have only further added to the menace. Case in point: the Ameerpet stretch. Swarming with street vendors and a heavy flow of traffic, the road here has turned into a driver’s nightmare due to the metro rail construction. 
 
 “On most days, passing through the Ameerpet stretch during peak hours means driving in first gear for at least 20-25 minutes. When a traffic police van gets in to clear the jam, it only leads to more chaos with vehicles trying to make way for it,” said a commuter, Jagadish Rao. 
 
 That the limited road space available is shared between RTC buses, private buses, goods vehicles, tankers, concrete mixer trucks, autos and pedestrians is another story. “The chances of being hit by a vehicle on city roads are increasing day by day. Earlier I used to walk down to Khairatabad from Red Hills to take a bus, but now crossing the road seems like an ordeal,” said Usha Kumari, a government employee.
 
 The chaos makes it very difficult to even board an auto or cab, say commuters. “On a few occasions, I have miraculously escaped being run over by RTC buses while hailing an auto. They drive so close that it’s scary,” said Revathi Rao, a resident of Ushamullapudi area.
