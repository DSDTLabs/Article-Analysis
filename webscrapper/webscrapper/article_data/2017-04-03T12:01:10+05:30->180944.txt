RAMATHEERTHAM(Vizianagaram): Two years have passed but the Sitarama Swamy temple at Ramatheertham in Nellimarla mandal of Vizianagaram district has not received the full amount that was promised it by the government.

 In March 2015, after presenting silk clothes and ‘Mutyala Talambraalu’ on behalf of the state government to Lord Sri Rama and Sita on Sri Rama Navami at the temple, endowments minister   had announced that a sum of Rs 1.71 crore would be given to the temple for its renovation as it is the largest Sri   in the north coastal districts.
 
 Only Rs 58 lakh was released by the government to the temple in the last two years, However, sources said even that money remains unutilised.
 
 Swami Srinivasananda Saraswathi, president of  , said the state government officially celebrates Sri Rama Navami at the temple but does nothing to improve the infrastructure there. 
 
 “There are no toilet facilities and rooms for women to change after bathing in the Koneru (pond) of the temple,” Saraswathi said.
 
 Jyothi Prasad, Ramatheertham Seva Parishat, said, “The government did not show any interest in making arrangements for the coming Rama Navami festival. As a result, the festival has to be put together by volunteers and locals.”
 
 When contacted, temple executive officer P Babu Rao said they would spend nearly Rs 5 lakh from the temple’s budget for the festival this year, he added. Sources said minister Manikyala Rao is slated to attend the festival on April 5, but indications are that he would stay away and depute the work to some other minister.
 
 The temple was developed by the Pusapati Rajas. It was initially ignored by former governments which gave priority to Bhadrachalam temple in Khammam district. Post bifurcation, the state government has started sending officials to the temple to offer the silk clothes.
