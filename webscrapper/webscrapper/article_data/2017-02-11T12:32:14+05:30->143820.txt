KOCHI: In order to improve the drinking water distribution system and to ensure tanker lorry operators will not collect contaminated water, the   cell has decided to install   (GPS) devices in hundreds of tankers in Ernakulam. 

 The state government's move comes after complaints were raised that the tankers were distributing contaminated water collected from different sources.
 
 "The water tankers owners need not spend money for installing the GPS device. The government will do it. The GPS will enable us to monitor the movement of the water tankers. We will be able to track them and know from where they collect water and where they distribute it. 
 
 "If any of the tankers are found to be distributing contaminated water, we will inform it to the concerned tahsildar in the area. The tankers, which fill up the water kiosks set up in many parts of the district will also come under scrutiny," said  , deputy collector of disaster management cell.
 
 The health department had certified 42 wells as sources of drinking water. The Water Tanker Lorries' Association welcomed the move to install the GPS in the water tanker. "It is a good initiative, considering that several complaints have been raised. We have been distributing drinking water in accordance to the rules and directions of the government. However, there are some other operators who distribute contaminated water. More than 300 water tankers are engaged in water distribution in the district," said  , president of the association.
 
 He said the number of water sources identified by the health officials has come down to around 15 due to shrinking groundwater levels.
