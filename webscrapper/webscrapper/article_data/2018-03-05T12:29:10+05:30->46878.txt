Ahead of the assembly elections in 2017, the Punjab Congress’s 121-page manifesto had made promises that would need around Rs 10,000 crore to be fulfilled. However, with the state government facing major fund crunch, many of the ambitious commitments remain a distant dream. 

 
 Here’s a status report on the key points of the manifesto:
 
 
  
 
 EMPLOYMENT
 
 PROMISES 
 
 Target to provide employment to at least one person in each family in five years from 2017-22. Untill these jobs are given, all identified unemployed would get unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month. As part of ‘Apni Gaddi Apna Rozgar’ scheme, 1 lakh taxies, commercial LCVs and other vehicles were to be provided to the unemployed youth every year at subsidized rates. Under ‘Harra (Green) Tractor Scheme (35 to 50 HP)’, at least 25,000 tractors along with other agricultural implements will be given at subsidized rates
 
 DONE SO FAR 
 
 First 11-day ‘Mega Job Fair’ was organized in August, 2017. 27,000 appointment letters, including 3,000 for government posts, were given to unemployed youths at the fair in Mohali. However, the focus has been only on jobs in private sector. In addition, the event organized recently in Bathinda as part of the second job fair saw little participation from youth as salaries offered were low. Even ‘Apni gaddi…’ also saw a failed start in Mohali last year.
 
 FREE SMARTPHONES
 
 PROMISES 
 
 The party had promised to give 50 lakh smartphones to youth. The scheme is expected to cost at least Rs 2,000 crore to the state as over 21 lakh youth are believed to have registered for free smartphones. There was no time limit set for the scheme promised in the manifesto. It was part of bigger plan of the party to engage and empower the youth and the registration process has seen massive response.
 
 DONE SO FAR 
 
 No phones have been distributed. Recently, the CM, for the first time made an annoucement, saying phone distribution will start this year. In October, 2017, chief minister Captain   met Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) in Mumbai. This had fuelled speculation that those who had registered at the special portal might get Jio phones. Government officials say the plan will be implemented after the modalities are worked out.
 
 AGRI CRISIS
 
 PROMISES 
 
 Apart from debt waiver, the   had also promised crop diversification with full input tax waiver for agro and food processing industries, establishment of price stabilization fund, introduction of farmers’ pension scheme, provision of health, life and plot based crop insurance. A complete ban on utilization of   for other purposes, setting up of ‘Punjab State Agricultural Insurance Corporation’, free regular soil health testing and 80% subsidy on drip and sprinkler irrigation were also promised.
 
 DONE SO FAR 
 
 First instalment of debt waiver made on January 7, where debt relief certificates worth Rs 167.39 crore given to 47,000 marginal and small farmers. However, the state government could allocate only Rs 1,500 crore in the budget for 2017-18. Farm organizations are, however, demanding complete debt waiver. Punjab lags behind in issuing soil health cards and nothing much has been done beyond announcements on other main promises too.
 
 REAL ESTATE SECTOR
 
 PROMISES 
 
 Recognize the real estate sector as infrastructure industry, review the collector rates of property, regularize all unauthorized colonies, and establish real estate regulatory authority (RERA). There will be no need of completion certificate for old approved colonies. No CLU will be charged in the same zone/category. Licensing will be decentralized and made easy.
 
 DONE SO FAR 
 
 A sub-committee of cabinet has been constituted to look into regularization of unauthorized colonies. Punjab has set up the RERA and unlike in neighbouring Haryana, there have been no allegations of diluting norms of the Central Act. Collector rates were revised soon after the Congress took over. The government has increased the CLU charges quite steeply. There are no signs of revival.
 
 BOOST TO INDUSTRY
 
 PROMISES 
 
 The manifesto had promised revival of existing industrial units, apart from inviting new ones. Setting up of industrial urban corridor between Amritsar & Chandigarh, along GT Road axis and along Hoshiarpur-Gurdaspur Road was pledged. Creation of new land bank for industrial development, power tariff for industry to be frozen at Rs 5/unit, and new industrial policy were also promised.
 
 DONE SO FAR 
 
 Rs 5 power tariff for industry was notified recently. Existing industry is looking for more incentives. Issues like revival of existing focal points remain only on paper. Things yet to turn around in industrial hubs like Mandi Gobindgarh that have been on a decline. The state is yet to attract any mega projects being allocated by the Centre. The cabinet has approved a new industrial policy that offers incentives and tax break in thrust areas.
 
 WAR AGAINST DRUGS
 
 PROMISES 
 
 Zero tolerance for trafficking, vigorous campaign to educate the young, Fast-track courts to try NDPS Act cases, law for confiscation of drug dealers’ were pledged. Review of cases registered against drug users and compassionate free rehabilitation with skill training initiatives at deaddiction centres were more humane aspects of the plan. Liquor consumption in Punjab doubled in the last 10 years, thus 5% of liquor vends were to be closed every year.
 
 DONE SO FAR 
 
 The government has constituted a Special Task Force (STF) that focus of curbing drug trade and rehabilitating addicts. State Special Operations (SSOP) cells have also joined the drive. Senior police officers are personally monitoring the action on this front, with the chief minister seeking daily reports on the issue. But there has been criticism that no big fish have been caught by the STF so far. The deaddiction centres are grappling problems like shortage of doctors. The number of vends has been cut as promised.
 
 FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS
 
 PROMISES 
 
 No superfluous borrowings by any department and borrowing permitted only for capital investments, to legitimate revenue in excise on liquor, auction money of minor mineral, CLU charges, transport fees and taxes, and cable fees were the main promises. To engage the required staff for all departments and pay full salaries, to establish an employment commission and a new policy to restructure agriculture and industry to facilitate producers, manufacturers and traders were other important pledges.
 
 DONE SO FAR 
 
 The government has introduced e-auction of sand mines and imposed entertainment tax on cable and DTH. Contractual staff has been up in arms, like employees from Bathinda refinery. The state has been unable to pay salary of even its officials on time. There are plans to set up employment commissions in every district. The agriculture livelihood policy is yet to be unveiled while the government has finalized draft of the industrial policy.
