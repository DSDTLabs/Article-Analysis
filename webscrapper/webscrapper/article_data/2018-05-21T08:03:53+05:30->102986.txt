HYDERABAD: The Neknampur Lake’s floating treatment wetland, which has been serving as a fitting example of low-cost but effective techniques used to clean city lakes, has been facing controversies after a group of citizens raised concerns over the use of styrofoam or thermocol for the wetlands.

 
 Dhruvansh, a voluntary organization working for the lake’s protection, introduced its first floating island in March 2017. It was designed using styrofoam, plastic, bamboo, gunny bags and coir. However, a citizens group say that the floating islands made using Styrofoam is harmful as its a banned material in many countries including India.

  of   said the PCB clearly told them that they have nothing to do with this permission. “Permission has to be taken from the irrigation department or the HMDA which we have. HMDA sponsored our project,” she added.
 
 When contacted, P  , joint chief environmental scientist at TSPCB assured that there is no such danger.
