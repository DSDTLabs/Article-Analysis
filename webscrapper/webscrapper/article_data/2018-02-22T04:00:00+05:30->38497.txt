Coimbatore: Though India’s market share in home textile imports by the US remained flat at 33% during 2017, its share (in US dollar terms) in cotton sheets increased 1% to 50% during the year. India has been consistently gaining a 1% market share in cotton sheets every year since 2012. India’s exports of cotton sheets to the US (in US dollar terms) increased 1.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) $717 million in 2017. Incidentally, cotton sheet exports from the rest of the world to the US declined 0.3% during the year. India was able to increase its market share in the segment on the back of a 2.9% rise in volumes that partially offset the 0.9% decline in realisations. US imports of cotton sheets remained flat during 2017. The country’s terry towel exports to the US increased 1.4% y-o-y to $642 million driven by a 6% y-o-y growth in volumes that negated the impact of a 4.4% y-o-y decrease in realisations. India’s share in terry towel imports by the US dropped 1% to 39% during 2017. While the rupee appreciated against the US dollar, the currencies of competitors depreciated against the Greenback placing Indian exporters at a disadvantage, observers said. Infestation of pink bollworm in major cotton producing regions of the country has led to an increase in cotton prices since mid-December 2017. This coupled with a 2% reduction in cotton crop estimate for 2017-18 season (October-September) and the 6.4% y-o-y appreciation of the rupee continues to remain an overhang for the textiles sector, observers said. “Ability to renegotiate product prices in the backdrop of rising raw material prices and rupee appreciation will be the key,” they said.
