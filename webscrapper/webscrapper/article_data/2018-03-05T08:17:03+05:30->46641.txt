BHUBANESWAR: In a bid to regain lost ground in the state, faction-ridden Congress has reached out to professionals in the city by launching the very first state chapter of the   ( ) - a key department of the grand old party on Saturday. 

 While the AIPC's chapters exist in different states, its first Odisha wing was launched in Bhubaneswar on Saturday. The AIPC is also keen to open chapters in Puri and Angul. MP Gaurav Gogoi, who is the AIPC's east zone coordinator, was present on Saturday's launch. 
 
 "Our objective is to give a political platform to working professionals who are educated and like the Congress ideology. They may not join Congress or attend political meetings. But by getting enrolled with the AIPC, they can share their valuable ideas and raise different issues that are plaguing the state," said AIPC's Bhubaneswar chapter president and senior Congress leader  . 
 
 A number of lawyers, IT professionals and engineers have evinced interest to join the AIPC, Mohanty said. 
 
 Mohanty said the Bhubaneswar chapter will soon identify a list of local issues and seek suggestions from its AIPC fellows following brainstorming sessions. "The resolutions passed in the ensuing AIPC meetings, will be taken up by the Congress. The party will fight for the justice of the citizens," Mohanty said, adding, that AIPC fellows can get a chance to interact with senior leaders of All India Congress Committee. 
 
 IT professional Soumyajit Das, who joined the AIPC's Bhubaneswar chapter, said such a platform will help educated and non-political people to have their say in politics. 
 
 "I may not be a part of the Congress, but I can now contribute my expertise to the party. Though I wanted to raise certain issues, I did not have any political platform earlier," said Das, who works in Bengaluru. Congress, beset with infighting, is on a sticky wicket following huge defeats in last year's panchayat elections and recent bypoll in Bijepur assembly constituency.
