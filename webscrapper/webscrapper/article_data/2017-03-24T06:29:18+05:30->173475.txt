ALLAHABAD: The newly appointed chief minister,  , has called for keeping the   and has even   there. However, doing the same might be a task for people in Allahabad. In reality check, TOI visited some of the important offices of the city to ascertain their cleanliness levels. 

 The district collectorate and the adjoining premises of the district court appeared somewhat cleaner that usual. However, as it turned out, the reason for the same was the impending visit of the Chief Justice of Allahabad high court. The interiors told another story. Several of the corners of the buildings and lawyers' chambers had a thick layer of red spittle of paan and gutkha. Several of the smaller shops close by were gone but lawyers still carried pockets full of paan. 
 
 A spot at the adjoining building of the Vikas Bhawan presented a unique picture of the brazen attitude of the employees and how attempts by the official, to keep the premises clean, are yet to yield the desired results. The wall, opposite the minority cell, said, "kripya thookein nahin, aap camere ki nazar mein hain (don't spit, you are under the surveillance of camera)" yet, employees and visitors of Vikas Bhawan openly spit on the wall. 
 
 Same is the situation at several of the other government offices located at the city, be it the office of sales tax, Allahabad Development Authorities, Allahabad Municipal Corporation or buildings of Indian Railways. District magistrate Sanjay Kumar said, "We have been trying to keep the premises of all government office clean but things cannot be changed overnight as we all have to do our bit."
