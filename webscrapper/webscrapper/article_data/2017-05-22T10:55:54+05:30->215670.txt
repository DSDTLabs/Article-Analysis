MADURAI: The state tourism department is planning to construct a bridge between   and Thiruvalluvar statue situated nearby. The department has submitted a proposal to the central government under   scheme and is waiting for its approval. 

 The Vivekananda Rock Memorial, located on a rocky island 500 meters away from mainland, attracts thousands of pilgrims and tourists every year. Inaugurated in 1970, the memorial has a shrine for Vivekananda and a meditation hall. The 133-foot-tall Thiruvalluvar statue, inaugurated in 2000, is located on a nearby rocky island. Tourists visiting Vivekananda Rock Memorial also visit this statue. However, the ferry service is limited to the statue as the sea bottom is rocky around Thiruvalluvar statue and low tides make it difficult to operate ferries to the statue. As a result, the number of services are less when compared to those operating to Vivekananda Rock Memorial. 
 
 In order to address this challenge, the tourism department has proposed to construct a 750-foot-long pedestrian bridge between the two islands. The bridge will come up at a cost of Rs 15 crore. The department has utilized the expertise of the engineering division of   to study the feasibility of constructing such a bridge. 
 
 “The proposal is in its initial stages. We have submitted it to the central government under Swadesh Darshan scheme. Once the central government approves it, the bridge will materialise between the two tourism spots,” said Kanyakumari district tourism officer Nelson. TNN
