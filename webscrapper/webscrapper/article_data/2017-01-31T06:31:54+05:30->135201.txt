BENGALURU: The incidence of domestic helps stealing valuables from their employers has been steadily declining over the past three years, thanks to various initiatives by residents and police, including checking of antecedents.

 While 284 such cases were registered in 2014, the number declined to 247 in 2015 and 236 in 2016.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (crime) S Ravi said checking of antecedents is the major reason for the decline. “Residents are better equipped nowadays. Installation of   inside homes has alerted residents about their employees stealing items. They’re are also a good deterrent,” Ravi added.
 
 According to police, culprits in more than 80% of these cases are new recruits.
 
 However, detection has also been declining in such cases -- only 157 cases were solved in 2014, 121 in 2015 and 78 in 2016.
 
 Police officers said poor detection is mainly because of recruitment of people from different places. The accused in most undetected cases come from distant towns and cities, and often give wrong personal details. Also, after stealing from their employers, they switch off their mobile phones or throw them away, making it impossible for police to track them down.
 
 “Domestic helps in many instances become part of the family. When they steal something, it’s a while before their employers even notice it,” a police officer said.
 
 A few years ago, a man was caught in   while trying to sell gold, diamond and silver jewellery worth Rs 2 crore. When interrogated, he spilled the beans. He was employed as a domestic help by a business tycoon and politician in Sadashivnagar, and had been stealing bits and pieces of jewellery over three years. When police contacted family members, they had no idea that jewellery was missing and did not suspect their employee of stealing it when he quit.
