VADODARA: Terrorized by the violence unleashed by   and other Rajput outfits, schools in   district have been asked to not include   in their cultural programmes.

 A day after district primary education officer (DPEO) issued a circular banning the songs, the district education officer (DEO) also issued a similar asking the schools not to play any songs of the movie in any of the cultural event or celebrations. Earlier on January 23, Bhavnagar   had issued a similar circular to all schools in the district.
 
 All government, non-granted and  , ashram and   have been asked to abide by the circular. The circular states that there is controversy over the film in the state and if any song or dance has been included in any event of the school, it be removed, lest any problem arises later.
 
 Though no violence or protests have been reported from Mahisagar district so far in connection with the movie, on Thursday, the DEO too issued a circular on the same lines to all the schools of the district.
 
 “Through the circular, I have instructed the schools to remove the song from any of their events so that no trouble eruptes later,” said DEO Y H Patel. He added that the decision was taken at the district level and no direction were given to them from the state education department to issue such a circular.
