MUMBAI: A month after   Mahesh   was granted bail in a   case, an author lodged a complaint against him alleging that he sexually harassed her 14 years ago. 

 
 On Monday, Mumbai police registered an FIR against Murthy under   sections 354 and 509 for outraging the modesty of woman and an act intended to insult her modesty. 
 
 A senior police official said the complaint is over alleged advances Murthy allegedly made during a 2004 business meeting in a cafe in the western suburb. “Though the incident dates back to 2004, the woman recently learned of his arrest in the other case. She gathered courage and decided to lodge a complaint.” 
 
 In her complaint, the author alleged she was introduced to Murthy in 2000 during a business meeting. She told police that since he was a marketing expert, she discussed difficulties in securing advertisements. 
 
 In January 2004, she met Murthy at a coffee shop where he allegedly spoke “about his open marriage” and leaned and touched her inappropriately. Despite repeated attempts to contact him, the angel investor remained unavailable for comment. Murthy was arrested last month for allegedly stalking and sexually harassing a Delhi woman in early 2017. He was released on bail hours later.
