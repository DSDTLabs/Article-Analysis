 This is the third bandh called by the Maoist in protest of the Kasnasur encounter within a span of a month. 
 
 The latest information was received by the security agencies through a banner and few pamphlets of the Reds spotted near Gatta Jambia village on Sunday morning. The banner, which also appeals the masses to observe the week between May 19 and 25 as ‘Pratirodh Saptah’ or week of resistance in the memory of their martyred comrades, was found hung near the village.

 After May 4 and May 10, this is the third bandh called to protest the encounters in April in Maharashtra and Chhatisgarh. Gadchiroli’s C60 commandos had eliminated 40 Maoists near Kasnasur, Boriya and Nainer village in the district on April 20 and 21 while Chhatishgarh police and Telangana’s Grey Hounds had gunned down another seven guerrillas at Ipenta on April 27.
