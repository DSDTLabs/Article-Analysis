CHENNAI: In an attempt to prevent malpractice, the state transport department has barred sale of   twowheelers for a period of three years.

 Seals, restricting sales, are stamped on the registration certificate of two-wheelers procured using the subsidy provided by the government under the Amma two-wheeler scheme.
 
 
 The decision comes against the backdrop of increasing complaints that free TV sets and mixers provided to people were illegally sold on the black market.
 
 The government provides 50% of the vehicle cost of Rs 25,000 as subsidy for working women in order to buy a two-wheeler (less than 125cc), as per the schemeâ€™s guidelines.
 
 Every year, one lakh women across the state would benefit from this scheme, which was promised by late chief minister   as part of her 2016 poll campaign.
 
 A government order issued recently in connection with this scheme mentioned that beneficiaries cannot sell their vehicles for a minimum period of three years without the permission of the   authorities or director of the said scheme.
 
 Confirming this, RC books issued to beneficiaries this week carried a seal mentioning the same.
