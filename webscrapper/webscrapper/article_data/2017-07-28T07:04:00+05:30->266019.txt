Raipur Phrala (Jalandhar): On visit to his ancestral village Raipur Pharala on Thursday, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the first turbaned member of the UK Parliament, took special note of the delapidated road leading to it. A considerable part of the road has big potholes. Dhesi also took a detour to visit the government senior secondary school in the village, even as residents gathered at the local gurdwara to felicitate him. 

 During his interaction with the students, he mentioned the condition of the road leading to Raipur Pharala. “It’s not in good condition. Good roads are imperative for raising other infrastructural facilities. Though we have become accustomed to bumpy roads, one hopes that students have a smooth path leading to their school. I hope that the poor condition of the road would be brought to the notice of the authorities concerned.”
 
 Standing there in the school, which his grandfather Swaran Singh Dhesi, father Jaspal Singh and uncle Paramjit Singh Raipur help build by pooling in funds, he urged the students to always remember their roots. “As you work hard and succeed in life, you should also contribute towards uplifting the Punjabi language,” he said. 
 
 Dhesi was later honoured by the panchayat at the village gurdwara. 
 
 Before reaching his ancestral home here and meeting his grandfather he also visited a sewing centre which is being run by a family-controlled NGO.
