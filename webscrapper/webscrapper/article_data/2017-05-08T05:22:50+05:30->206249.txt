MUMBAI: The Anti-Corruption Bureau has sought the state home department's permission to investigate the deliberate prolonging of investigation in a corruption case pertaining to the tribal department. 

 The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court recently ordered a probe observing that the delay of five years in investigating the purchase of generator sets for ashramshalas was deliberate and done to benefit the petitioner as well as certain officials. The bench recently ordered the home department to find the real culprits.
 
 These ashramshalas provide education to poor tribal children from the region. 
 
 In 2011, the tribal department decided to purchase 50 generators of 10 KVA each for the ashramshalas in the drought-hit districts of Akola, Amravati and Yavatmal.
 
 Subsequently,  , an NGO, lodged a complaint with the ACB about misappropriation of public funds. The ACB then began investigating the case quietly. In 2013, it obtained permission to carry out an open investigation as Rs 72 lakh was alleged to have been appropriated by Vishwambar Varvantkar, additional commissioner, tribal department, Amravati, along with the project officer. 
 
 The officials allegedly connived with G S Enterprises, Mumbai, to purchase manually operated generator sets while the state treasury had paid for automatic generator sets.
 
 The ACB, in its report, said that in 2011 the project officer moved a proposal before the district planning committee to purchase manually operated generator sets for Rs 1.79 crore. The committee approved the proposal. 
 
 However, states the report, the additional commissioner at his level presented inflated bills to the treasury for purchase of automatic generator sets. For this, forged bills were generated in the name of another company by the proprietor of G S Enterprises.
 
 After the ACB filed a criminal complaint against Varvantkar, he moved the Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC in 2015 to quash the complaint.
