NEW DELHI: The mercury touched 25.5 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, making it the   that the capital has seen in the last five years. 

 The maximum was six degrees above normal for the season and the minimum was recorded at 9.1 degrees—two notches above normal. The maximum   may rise further in the next few days, met officials said. Delhi last saw a warmer January 16 in 2012 when it recorded a maximum temperature of 25.6 degrees Celsius. 
 
 The rise in temperatures also helped Delhi’s air quality improve, with pollution levels coming down to ‘poor’ from ‘very poor’ on Monday. On Tuesday, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 256—a sharp drop from 330 on Monday, making it the cleanest day in terms of air quality this week.
 
 Officials from Regional   Forecasting Centre (RWFC) said temperatures are expected to stay above normal for the next 5-6 days, with winds carrying a westerly component. “The wind direction may soon change, raising the temperature to around 26 degrees. This is warmer than normal as maximum for January should be around 20 degrees Celsius,” said an RWFC scientist.
 
 Most locations across the capital recorded a maximum of over 24 degrees, with the Ridge area touching 25.5, Lodhi road 25.3 and Ayanagar recording a maximum of 25.2 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the humidity levels were between 35% and 83%.
 
 Data from CPCB’s central control room showed both PM2.5 and PM10 levels falling to around two times the safe standard, with wind speed increasing on Tuesday. The average PM2.5 levels were recorded at 121 micrograms per cubic metre at 9pm on Tuesday, while the average PM10 levels were around 236 micrograms per cubic metre. The safe standard for both particulates is 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.
