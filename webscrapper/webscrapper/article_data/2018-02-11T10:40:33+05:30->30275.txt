PATNA: Patna   and Hospital ( ) may get an effluent treatment plant (ETP) for liquid waste management. The plant will be set up through   and Infrastructure Corporation Limited (BMSICL).

 A decision to submit a corresponding proposal to the state government was taken in a meeting between Rogi Kalyan Samiti and PMCH administration headed by Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor on February 2. 
 
 “A detailed project report will be prepared by April. It will then be sent to the state government for its approval. Although PMCH already has an incinerator for solid waste management, hospitals generally generate lots of liquid waste and discharge it in the open, which can fester infection and diseases. Hence, the requirement of another ETP was felt,” said Kishor, who is also the chairperson of the samiti.
 
 PMCH superintendent Dr Deepak Tandon said the hospital does not have a proper drainage system. “The drain overflows quite frequently. That is the reason a drain is being reconstructed near the gynaecology department,” he said.
 
 Though PMCH has an ETP with the capacity to treat more than 100 litres of liquid waste, the hospital administration has assessed the need for a larger ETP owing to redevelopment plan for the hospital. A field visit in this regard was conducted a month ago by BMSICL. 
 
 As of now, the liquid waste being produced in the two laboratories — one in the hospital and another in the college — besides the hospital’s emergency and operation theatres is being treated with sodium hydrochloride before being discharged in the municipal drainage.
 
  (BSPCB) scientist   said not all liquid waste produced in the hospital is biomedical waste. “As per Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2016, hospitals are required to dispose of their biomedical waste in a scientific manner,” he said.
