BENGALURU: The Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices and  , 2017 seeks to ban Made Snana   in which   which contain food left behind by the Brahmins.

 The bill, which was cleared by the state cabinet on Wednesday, will be tabled in the legislature during the winter session at Belagavi in November. The bill, without directly mentioning Made Snana, prohibits the practice that facilitates “any person or persons to roll over (urulu seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in public or religious places or similar practices that violate human dignity“.
 
 This practice, prevalent in a few temples and mutts in Dakshina Kannada district, had drawn criticism from rationalists and progressive thinkers in the past few years.While those supporting the practice argue that participating in   is voluntary and in sync with the right to religious faith and belief, progressive thinkers dismissed it as a “casteist claim based on blind beliefs“.
 
 Progressive thinkers had been mounting pressure on chief minister Siddaramaiah to ban the practice under the anti-superstition bill.
 
 Briefing reporters here, law minister T B Jayachandra said the bill was being mooted to prevent the common man from falling prey to the sinister designs of religious conmen and black magicians. Those who indulge in promotion of inhuman and evil practices and black magic will be imprisoned up to seven years and will be slapped with a penalty up to Rs 50,000. Those who kill or injure innocent persons while committing black magic will be charged with murder. The proposed legislation envisages appointment of vigilance officers of the rank of police inspector to crack down against conmen and black magicians.
