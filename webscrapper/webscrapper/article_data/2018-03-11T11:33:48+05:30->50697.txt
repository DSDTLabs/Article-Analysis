JODHPUR: There is a need to link agriculture with ayurveda, said minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare Gajendra Singh   during his address on the 16th foundation day of Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurveda University in Jodhpur on Saturday. 

 Referring to the vision of doubling farmers’ income in the country by 2022, Shekhawat said that by linking agriculture with ayurveda, not only the income of farmers would increase but it would also give a huge boost to ayurveda practice in the country.
 
 “Practice of ayurveda is growing not only in the country but entire world due to growing recognition of this ancient medical practice. We will have to prepare ourselves to meet this growing demand and expectations from us,” said Shekhawat.
 
 While emphasizing the need for research in the field, he said that if agriculture and ayurveda could be combined, it would start a revolution and give the country a glorified place in the world of medicine and health.
 
 “For this, seminars are needed for identification of ayurvedic herbs with respect to their geo-climate conditions and to promote their protected cultivation and harvesting,” Shekhawat said.
 
 Highlighting the achievements of the varsity, V-C   said the university has emerged as a centre of excellence in the field of “panchkarma” and research on thalassaemia has already been initiated in the university.
 
 On the occasion, all former vice chancellors, registrars, finance controllers, deans and other ayurveda scholars were honoured for their contribution in bringing the university to its present position. A blood donation camp was also organized on the day.
 
 A seminar on ‘panchkarma’ was held in which 150 experts and scholars from across the country took part.
