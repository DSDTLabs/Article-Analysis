CHENNAI: In a setback for Makkal Needhi Maiam chief Kamal Haasan’s attempts to bring the opposition together on a common Cauvery platform, the  , its   and friendly parties have decided not to attend the   convened by the actor on May 19 to discuss the inter-state river dispute post the Supreme Court judgment. 

 Kamal Haasan, who is currently on a tour of the southern districts, met DMK working president M K Stalin on Monday to invite him for the meeting. The actor-politician also invited several other leaders, including TNCC chief S Thirunavukkarasar, BJP state president Tamilisai Sounderarajan, VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan and AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran, besides actor Rajinikanth. Soon after meeting Stalin, Kamal said, “Everyone irrespective of their political affiliations must come under a single umbrella and work for people’s rights.” On Thursday, Stalin told reporters that DMK and eight other parties decided not to participate in the meeting. He gave no reason. 
 
 “Though an all-party meeting under DMK has been postponed, all friendly party leaders felt there was no need to participate in the meeting convened by Kamal. We will not attend the meeting,” Stalin said. Since April 1, DMK, Congress, CPI, CPM, MDMK, VCK and other smaller parties have met on several occasions and participated in protests to put pressure on the Centre to constitute the Cauvery Management Board. “We participated in the protests after achieving consensus at the all-party meetings convened by the DMK. We felt there was no need for another parallel all-party meeting on the same issue,” CPI state secretary R Mutharasan told TOI.
