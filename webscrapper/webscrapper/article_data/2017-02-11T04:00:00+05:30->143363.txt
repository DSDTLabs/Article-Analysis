Chennai: Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV), the wholly owned Indian arm of DaimlerBenz, on Thursday said that they would achieve break even this year on the back of increased exports.

 For the calendar year 2016, DICV sold 13,081 BharatBenz branded trucks (13,997 in 2015). However exports rose to 4,500 units from 2,100 units in 2015. “Indian markets remained one of the brutal markets in the region,” said MarcLlistosella, head of Daimler Trucks Asia. “Our Indian operations at DICV are a cornerstone of our success. With the launch of third product line for 2017 we will enter the next stage of growth.”
 
 The year (2017) will be a better year, said Erich Nesselhauf, MD of DICV. He added that the second half of 2016 was choppy due to uncertainty over GST and its rate for trucks. “The demonetization (of high value currency) impacted truck sales as fleet operators were stranded without cash. Trucks remained parked on the highways for several days,” he said. With domestic market turning cold, DICV increased its export focus.
 
 Detailing plans for this year, he said that the new sub 9-tonne truck range will be introduced in April and all trucks rolled out after April 1, would be BSIV emission complaint with airconditioned truck cabins. 
 
 DICV drove in first range of buses into Indian from its Oragadam plant in January 2012. So far it has invested nearly Rs 5,000 crore. It employs more than 2,800 persons directly across truck and bus factories spread across 400 acres.
