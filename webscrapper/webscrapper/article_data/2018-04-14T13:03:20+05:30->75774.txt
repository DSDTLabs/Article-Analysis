VADODARA: Income tax (IT) department searches at the properties of Amit Bhatnagar’s   (DPIL) has brought the bank officials under the scanner too. 

 I-T teams that are examining the account books and other documents of DPIL have learnt that the figures were fudged to show more turnover and get loans from the banks. “The bank officials, who passed the loans, too seemed involved in this fraud. We are still examining the documents that have been seized from the company offices. We will also question the bank officials at the later stage,” said an I-T official. 
 
 The search that began three days ago ended on Friday. 
 
 “The loans that were granted by the banks were public money and it was misappropriated. It will take some more days to ascertain the figures that were fudged,” the official added.
 
 I-T sleuths may also question those who audited the accounts of DPIL. “The promoters were simply moving money from one group company to other to show a better turnover. The   ought to have come across such anomaly,” an official said. 
 
 The teams were facing issues as none of the promoters were present during the search at DPIL office. 
 
 Notices will be issued to the promoters who have been incommunicado since the   registered a fraud case worth Rs 2,654 crore against them last week. According to the FIR filed by the CBI, DPIL availed loans despite its name appearing in RBI’s defaulters’ list and the   caution list, which CBI officials say couldn’t have been possible without involvement of bank officials. CBI has also booked unknown bank officials in this case.
