 Special police troops from Jaipur and Dausa were also deployed to ensure that situation does not spiral out of control. “There was a call for bandh on Friday morning. Some organisations in areas such as Jatia tried to close shops which sparked tension,” said a police official, adding that the cops immediately took control of the situation by dispersing crowds.
 
 However, fear-stricken residents locked themselves up inside their houses as cops armed with tear gas and anti-riot guns carried out a flag march in large columns across the length and breadth of the city. In some places, miscreants set tea shops on fire and pelted stones at each other as they clashed on main roads.
 
 Sikar superintendent of police Akhilesh Kumar claimed the situation was under control as no fresh incidents of violence have been reported after Friday morning.
 
 He said added the reasons behind Thursday’s clash were being investigated. “There was some minor dispute in a locality near Kalyanji Temple, involving children. The situation flared up and people clashed with each other. However, we have taken control of the situation and additional police have been deployed in sensitive areas,” Kumar told TOI over phone.
 
 Areas such Dujod Gate, Kalyanji ka Temple, Ramlila Ground Road, Ghantaghar and localities surrounding Karinagar have virtually turned into ‘police cantonments', with anti-riot vehicles blocking roads and armed policemen guarding every corner of the street.
