PANAJI: The   on Friday said that the Congress’ claim to form the government was ‘desperate, frustrated and cheap theatrics’. Lok Sabha MP Narendra Sawaikar slammed the Congress’ demand to dismiss the   government, adding that Friday’s development was an attempt to cover up the failure of its own leadership and party president Rahul Gandhi.

 Sawaikar said that when Girish Chodankar was appointed state   president, the party ‘showed a carrot’ to the party promising that they would form the government. “This attempt appears to keep Congress legislators together,” Sawaikar said. “This may be the first time in the history of India that a political party has claimed that the government should be dismissed and they be invited to form the government.”
 
 He also said that since the BJP came to power, the people of India supported it. On the contrary, he alleged that Gandhi has been rejected by the people, and that Indians wouldn’t fall prey to Congress theatrics. 
 
 Sawaikar said that after the 2017 Goa assembly election, the same Congress approached the Supreme Court, but the BJP passed the floor test. “The Congress accepted the Supreme Court order,” Sawaikar said. “Neither did they challenge it nor did they approach the apex court again after the vote of confidence,” he said. “We condemn this attempt of the Congress.”
