New Delhi: Economic Offences Wing ( ) will now have three more days to interrogate   and Ajay Chandra, owner-directors of real estate major   Limited. They are accused of allegedly duping over 550 customers of a proposed housing project in Gurgaon’s Sector 70

 A Delhi court on Monday said that the custodial interrogation of the two was necessary to recover “incriminating evidence”. EOW informed the court that certain documents/ledgers were recovered from the office of the accused people during investigation into the proposed housing project, Wildflower Country, for floors named Anthea Floors.
 
 The investigating officer in the case told additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ashu Garg that more incriminating documents to find the money trail and to ascertain the beneficiaries of the “cheated” amount were yet to be recovered from the other offices of the accused. The officer also claimed that the two days — one of them April 2, a Sunday — granted earlier were not sufficient to recover the documents.
 
 “I have gone through the case files of the investigating officer and heard both the sides. It is clear that further custodial interrogation of both the accused is necessary to recover the incriminating documents and to collect evidence from other offices...Thus, both the accused persons are remanded in police custody for three days,” the court said
 
 The defence counsels for the Chandras, Vijay Aggarwal and Rinku Garg, did not raise any serious objection to the extension of their custodies. It turned dramatic outside the courtroom where homebuyers, also the complainants in the case, started shouting in protest against the Chandras.
 
 Earlier, Delhi Police had found that only land filling was done and a few sewerage pits had been constructed in the proposed Wildflower Country project. EOW said that the Chandras claimed to have utilised Rs 94 crore of the money that Unitech received from all customers and financial institutions.
