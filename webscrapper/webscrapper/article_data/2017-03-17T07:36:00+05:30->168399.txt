GURUGRAM: Cops have been keeping a close watch on the Gwalpahari area ever since MCG razed a few farmhouses. The MCG on Tuesday took possession of 142 acres of land in Gwalpahari, on which 34 farmhouses were constructed illegally. The MCG, according to police, suspects that the occupants of the demolished farmhouses might attempt to rebuild the illegal structures in the area.

 “We are keeping a constant vigil in the area. In fact, the caretakers who were living in these farmhouses in the absence of owners, refused to budge. We had to forcefully evict them and made them aware of the consequences if they trespass or encroach upon the government land,” a senior officer at the DLF Phase-1 police station told TOI. 
 
 MCG alleged that the encroachers were trying to garner sympathy. “These illegal occupants are refusing to vacate the land and might approach the court. They claim that we evicted them without issuing any prior notice. We suspect that the encroachers might reconstruct rooms and boundary walls. Therefore we wanted cops to be deployed there,” said an MCG official.
 
 The MCG has been involved in a protracted ownership battle over 464-acre prime land in the region, bordering Delhi and located off the   road, where the rich and powerful— including former Union ministers and   judges — have homes. As many as 324 private entities are in possession of Gwalpahari land and claim they are its rightful owners, but MCG contends that Haryana government is the owner of the land.
