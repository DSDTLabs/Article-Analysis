UDHAGAMANDALAM: Plastic bottles and carry bags dumped on drains were the main cause for the flood at the  , the centre of Ooty town, on Wednesday, according to the Ooty municipal officials. Rain lashed Ooty town for about an hour in the evening, leaving many low lying areas flooded. Ooty registered 50 mm of rain in an hour.

 While Ketti registered 27 mm of rain in 24 hours up to 8am on Thursday, Devala received 38 mm. Ooty received the highest rainfall in the hills.
 
 A drainage channel running through the   office and connecting the public works department (PWD) office near Charing Cross flooded the shopping complex as the channel was clogged with plastic bottles and carry bags. 
 
 “The NCMS parking area was found littered with plastic plates, bottles and other garbage. It is learnt that many tourists, after parking their vehicles, cook food and eat there, after which they just dump the garbage and leave,” Dr  , Ooty municipal health officer, told TOI. “Plastic garbage was the main reason the drainage channel got clogged.”
 
 TOI had reported about the overflowing drainage in front of the PWD office on   and another one just in front of a private nursing home on Old Garden Road, among other overflowing drainage channels, on September 23.
 
 The municipality on Thursday cleared the drain near the public works department office. “We will also clear the one near the private nursing home on Old Garden Road. We are looking at a permanent solution to these issues,” said Murali Shankar.
 
 “Unless cooking on the roadside and parking areas by tourists is banned, we cannot control clogging of drains in the town. Also, the drainage system in Ooty town was developed 40 years ago based on the population at that time,” said the health officer.
 
 “We have brought the issue of cooking and littering by tourists to the notice of the collector for prompt action,” he added.
