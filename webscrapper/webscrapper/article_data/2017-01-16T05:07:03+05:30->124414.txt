Running is my passion. I've been running for the past five years and this was my second   here. It completes me as a person. Running a full marathon is akin to real life. Sunday’s run was very critical as I needed to complete it within five hours to qualify for the 89-km   in  .

 So, despite the warm weather, high humidity and seeing other runners’ cramp, I had to keep going. It had to be mind over body. I knew I had to complete the first 21 km swiftly so that I could take it slow once the sun was up. I was also injured for over two months and could train for only three weeks —so it was like climbing the Mount Everest, but I had to remain focused.
 
 The toughest stretches were the   slope and the   where the sun hit us, but cheering of Mumbaikars and your running buddies keep you going. When I reached Pizza By the Bay, one of the best runners I know had a cramp and was way behind of where he should have been. On seeing me also struggling, he reminded me how important this run was for me, pushing me to the finish line. I finished the race in 4 hours 52 minutes, scrapping through to qualify for my big run in June. 
 
 Running teaches you to be disciplined, makes you focused, increases your resilience and empowers you with a never say die attitude. Although running a marathon is in groups, completing a marathon is an individual triumph. It is a triumph over your fears, your ability to endure the distance and the sacrifices of your social life. The irony of it is we train the whole year just to endure this sweet pain on the marathon and soak in the glory of finishing it against all odds. Like they say, we amateur runners don’t have a runners’ body but we make our bodies run.
