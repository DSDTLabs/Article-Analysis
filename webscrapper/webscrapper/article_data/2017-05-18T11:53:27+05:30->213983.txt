BHUBANESWAR: The CBI's joint director A Y V Krishna reached here on Wednesday to take stock of the progress of investigation into the chit fund scams. While the   were tight-lipped about the outcome of Krishna's stock-taking visit, sources said the top cop asked the probe agency to expedite investigation into the   scam. 

 Seashore chit fund scam so far caused maximum embarrassment to the ruling BJD, though its   and MP Ramachandra Hansdah were arrested in 2014 in connection with Artha Tatwa (AT) Group  . Role of the state government came under scanner in the Seashore Group scam as the company had joined hands with several agencies of the government to execute different projects on public private partnership (PPP) mode. 
 
 In the Seashore scam, the   has so far arrested only three persons - the company's CMD Prashant Dash, his brother Prabhat and a conduit Subhankar Nayak, who reportedly spilled the beans regarding the nexus between several politicians, police officers and bureaucrats with the scamsters. However, the CBI drew flak for not turning up the heat on the bigwigs in the case so far. 
 
 "We discussed the progress of the probe in all the 44 chit fund scams, including Seashore Group. We apprised him of the present status of all the cases. Our probe into Seashore scam is still open. We already questioned some bureaucrats and police officers. Action will be taken once we come across any evidence against them," said a CBI officer. 
 
 The CBI said at present their focus is to expedite the conviction process. "In the past one month, at least 13 employees of seven chit fund companies have been convicted," the officer added.
