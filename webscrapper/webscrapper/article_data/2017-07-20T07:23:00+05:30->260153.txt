 Ludhiana: Tension prevailed on Gaushala Road, old city, when two groups of students clashed inside Veer Haqiqat School around 11am on Wednesday. They attacked each other with rods and when one of the students ran to his house, located near the school, a group chased him and pelted his house with bricks. Three students and a teacher suffered injuries. 
 
 Two students, one of Class XI and the other of Class XII, had got into a fight some days ago. On Wednesday, the one in Class XII went to meet the other to resolve the issue. But again a tiff ensued and the Class XI student slapped the other. He was also thrashed by other students of Class XI. 
 
 After a few minutes, the situation got worse when both the groups, of around 25 students, attacked each other with rods. The teacher who intervened also suffered minor injuries. A student of Class XII who ran home was also attacked.
 
 The 17-year-old boy told the police, “I had gone there to resolve the matter, but it ended in a fight. The Class XI student beat me up and tossed my turban.”
 
 School principal K K Rudra was on leave, but the staff tried to play down the issue. The division number 3 police reached the school and registered a complaint.
 
 Even as both the groups struck a compromise later in the day, the matter has now reached Punjab State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights. The panel chairman, Sukesh Kaila, said, “I received a complaint that the school has no CCTV cameras and security guards. I will look into the matter.”
