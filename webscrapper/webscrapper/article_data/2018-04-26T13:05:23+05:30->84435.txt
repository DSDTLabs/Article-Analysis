MADURAI: “Save   Coalition”, a forum comprising retired professors, lawyers and social activists, has demanded the scrapping of the one-man   commission inquiring into the   sex scandal. Instead, it has demanded a probe by a panel formed with distinguished educationalists and a retired high court judge as members. It claimed that there was no provision in the rules governing MKU for the governor to form an inquiry commission.

 The outfit said that the Nirmala Devi incident, where she allegedly tried to lure a group of girls to do sexual favours for higher officials in the university, was just the tip of the iceberg. The scandal was an extension of the deteriorating environment in the university in the last few years, the members said. 
 
 The coalition while expressing confidence in the CB-CID inquiry felt that the probe could have been conducted under the supervision of the high court. The office-bearers claimed to have evidences of the corrupt practices that took place in the university in recent years and would share them if a credible inquiry was conducted. Secretary R Murali said that to ensure fair probe into the allegation and other corruption charges in the university, higher officials like the VC and registrar should stay away from their offices.
