Madurai: The   has directed the state government to disburse pension to retired employees of the state-run  . 

 Justice S S Sundar gave this direction on a petition filed by the State Transport Corporations Retired Employees Welfare Association represented by its president   and a few retired employees.
 
 When the petition came up for hearing, the petitioner’s side said the state’s transport secretary-cum-chairman of the state-run transport corporations acted against the settlement made between transport corporations and employees association on January 22, 2011. The secretary restricted the revision of pension at 15% from April 2015. Challenging it, a case was filed before the high court.
 
 Now, the   State Transport Corporations Employees Pension Trust which is responsible for disbursing pension stopped the pension for all the retired employees from February last. 
 
 Demanding pension, the retired employees staged peaceful protests in front of head offices of the transport corporations. But, there was no action on the part of the corporations. If pension was not given, the families of the retired employees would be put under great hardship. Hence, the court needed to intervene in the issue and to direct the government and transport corporations to disburse pension to all retired employees.
 
 Following it, the bench directed to provide pension to them and adjourned the case to April 12.
