Hyderabad: The baby  , which was captured on Sunday, was playing hide-and-seek with the local children for the last three days near the nala at Azampura, Chaderghat. The children who play near the nala had spotted the reptile on and off. They had found it to be aggressive despite its size and were alarmed when it tried to  .

 “Today, the children informed us about the latest spotting. Initially, I did not believe the children’s words, but when I saw the crocodile, I was taken aback. We regularly spot snakes in the nala, but never came across a crocodile,” M Prabhakar, an eyewitness and one of the three people who nabbed the reptile, told TOI. 
 
 He said that no one had any idea about how to nab the reptile. “I decided to get into the nala and searched for a long time. A few times, it hid itself behind stones and on some occasions it tried to attack us. On one attempt, I could grab its tail, but it still escaped. So, three of us used sticks and immobilised it,” Prabhakar said.
 
 As the nala is close to a temple, devotees used to dump leftover food packets in it. Perhaps the reptile was getting out of the nala for food. Initially, the locals were not sure whom to hand over the reptile, but finally they decided to alert the police. 
 
 In 2010, an eight-foot crocodile was found at a construction site filled with storm water in Nanakramguda. It took nine days to trap the reptile.
