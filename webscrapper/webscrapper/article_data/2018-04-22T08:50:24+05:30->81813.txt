 “It is clear that policy of polarization being adapted by BJP in other parts of the country is being replicated in Punjab also. Things should be clear to one and all that who is behind the latest attempt of polarization in Punjab when names of RSS and BJP leaders figure in the FIR registered just fter the clash which has caused tension not just in Phagwara but in the region,” Pathak said.
