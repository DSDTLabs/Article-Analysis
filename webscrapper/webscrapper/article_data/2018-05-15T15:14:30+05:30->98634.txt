CHANDIGARH: A park meant for children to play and for adults to enjoy a stroll has become a   in   next to Sector 38 West.

 This big park is on the outskirts of the colony, facing towards the dividing road of Sectors 38 West and 39. On this makeshift dumping ground, heaps of rotting domestic waste are strewn all over a space that belongs to the village. Children from the poor   can easily use its open ground for playing, but they can’t go into this place choked with stinking rotten garbage and animal feces, which has made even passing by this park difficult.
 
 Colony resident   said: “Once that the practice started, people don’t think twice now before disposing of garbage at this spot. Everyone started doing the same thing. The mountain of garbage has become so big that it seems nearly impossible to clear it completely.” The garbage is scattered over a huge area and it contains harmful plastic waste such as food wrappers, PET bottles, and carry bags. Several drains are clogged with this plastic waste. Apart from the garbage problem, stray dog menace has also increased in the area. The risk of dog bite has multiplied, creating an even more unfavorable place for walking and playing.
 
 When the TOI team made some enquiries in the neighbourhood, several residents came out with complaints about a the irregular service of safai karamcharis (sanitation workers of the municipal corporation). They claim to have never spotted them in the area.
