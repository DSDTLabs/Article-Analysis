NEW DELHI: A couple was arrested on Tuesday for trafficking runaway girls after luring them from railway stations in the city. They used to keep a lookout for such girls, strike up a conversation and assure to take them home safely. However, the girls would be raped and subsequently sold off in Haryana and other states.

 In October 2016, the couple, Haseena and Armaan, met a 15-year-old girl who had arrived at Nizamuddin railway station from Chhattisgarh. They lured her with the promise of a good job and marriage and took her to their apartment where Armaan raped her. They kept her locked inside a room and later sold her for Rs 70,000 to Pappu Yadav, a resident of Faridabad, who raped and then “married” her.
 
 On February 2, the girl managed to escape and reached Nizamuddin railway station, where she again bumped into Haseena. This time Haseena handed her over to two rikshawpullers — Mohammed Afroz and Mohammed Zakir — who gang-raped her.
 
 The police received a call from BSF personnel that a minor girl was being taken away forcefully by two men. A police team reached there along with Delhi Commission for Women members and the rickshawpullers were arrested. Later, Yadav was also arrested. After getting this news, the couple fled from their rented apartment in Sarai Kale Khan.
 
 The couple was arrested after the police got a tip-off that they were at a traffic signal in Sarai Kale Khan. “The arrested have confessed to having sold off another girl. Raids have been carried out in Uttar Pradesh to trace her,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya. A case has been registered at Sunlight Colony police station.
