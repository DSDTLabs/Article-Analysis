 Goyal said that the starting of Mahamana Express is like reviving the bond that the two cities have shared in the past. “It was   who had ensured that   gets a modern library facility. The entire expenditure to set up the library at Varanasi was borne by him,” he said. 
 
 PM himself tweeted: “Mahamana Express connects Varanasi & Vadodara, both vibrant cultural centres as well as Varanasi & Surat, both vibrant textile centres.”
