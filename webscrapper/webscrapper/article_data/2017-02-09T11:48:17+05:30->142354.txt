MANGALURU: The state government’s recent circular on new admissions to Class 1 has put both parents and the school authorities in a tizzy.

 According to the circular, if any child, who is below 5 years and 10 months by June 2017, he or she will have to wait for a year to get into class I. Earlier, under voluntary admission clause, parents were able admit their children who were above five years to class 1. “But the new circular states that children who have completed 5 years 10 months by June 2017 will only be eligible for admission and there is no mention about voluntary admission in the circular dated January 18, 2017,” said Renny D’Souza, director, Childline (Padi).
 
 If the government doesn’t make changes or allow voluntary admission, then the children who are below the stipulated   will have to waste one academic year. “Authorities concerned are trying to convince the government on this issue,” added Renny. The age eligibility for LKG is 3 years 10 months.
 
 Walter H D’Mello, deputy director of public instruction,   said: “The circular is issued keeping RTE norms in mind. If a child needs to be admitted in class 1, he or she should be aged above 5 years, 10 months." 
 
 The circular further states that no school should deny admission for children aged between 6 and 14 years under any circumstances and they should be admitted to a class according to their age. Those parents who come without the birth certificate of their children also cannot be denied admission. Circular directed the school authorities to undertake a written statement from parents before admitting a child.

 The circular will come into effect from June 2017 and does not apply to children who have already taken admissions. The aim of sticking to 5 years 10 months for class 1 admission is that children who turn 16 during class 10 will be more mature mentally and can be good decision makers.
