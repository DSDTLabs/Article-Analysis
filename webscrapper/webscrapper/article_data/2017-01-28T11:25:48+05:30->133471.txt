INDORE: Giving the city’s development plan a major push,   (IDA) on Friday decided to invite tenders for a proposed underpass near   and prepared a detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed underpass at Vijay Nagar Square and a flyover at Pipliyahana Square.

 IDA, in its board meeting attended by chairman Shankar Lalwani and district collector P Narahari, held a discussion over a survey that determined the feasibility of easing traffic at Vijay Nagar Square, Pipliyahana Square, Bengali Square and Tower Square.
 
 “The underpass at Shivaji Statue Circle will be developed with one branch starting from MY Hospital towards   while the proposed underpass at Vijay Nagar Square will have a branch starting from Rasoma Square towards Mangal City mall,” an IDA official said.
 
 A flyover at Pipliyahana Square will be developed alongside the ring road.
 
 The board also decided to allot plots to as many as 66 plot holders of Scheme 166 whose previous land allotments were cancelled due to the court’s intervention and encroachments.
 
 “In a lottery based system held on January 11, IDA had announced the list of affected people who would be given possession over the plots in the same residential scheme. The board has given its permission,” he added.
 
  (IMC) will be handed over flats, meant for financially weaker sections, developed at Scheme 155 under the   (JNNURM).
 
 The flats will be given to residents affected by the Bada Ganapati – Rajmohalla Circle (Ganeshganj) road widening project.
 
 IMC will be asked to either pay the development cost to IDA or adjust it under other heads, in which the development body is liable to pay the corporation.
 
 The issue related to Sayaji Hotel’s lease cancellation, for violating its lease terms by developing shops, could not find a place in the meeting’s agendas.
