VADODARA: With government of India (GOI) deciding to increase the minimum support price (MSP) by 1.5 time of cost of production of agriculture crops, the demand to include milk in the list of agriculture produce has surfaced. 

 Dairy major -   ( ) – India’s largest dairy co-operative federation that markets brand Amul, has demanded this post the announcement on MSP made by union finance minister   in the union budget on Thursday. 
 
 “Milk is a much bigger crop than wheat and paddy put together. More over in milk, 80% producers are landless and marginal farmers, so the number of beneficiaries are more than the other agricultural crops,” said GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi, adding that the increase in MSP by 1.5 time of cost of production will reduce farmer distress which is very much required at this moment. 
 
 The 18 member of GCMMF in Gujarat presently procure an average of 210 lakh litres of milk per day from 36 lakh milk producers who are registered as members in 18,549 village level milk societies across the state. 
 
 The co-operative player has also demanded that the government should extend the 100% exemption granted on profit earned by farm producer companies (having turnover of up to Rs 100 crore) to other allied agriculture sectors like dairy, animal husbandry as well as to primary village co-operative societies. 
 
 “This will result in better remunerative prices to farmers for their agriculture products,” he said, adding that the extension of Kisan credit card to animal husbandry will benefit in form of direct receipts of government benefits and will create credit history for milk producers. 
 
 “The Rs 10,000 crore corpus fund for aquaculture, fisheries and animal husbandry will help create infrastructure facilities in animal husbandry sector which will indirectly benefit the dairy sector,” he added.
