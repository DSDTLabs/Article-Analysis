NEW DELHI: Congress lamented on Monday that lynchings were the idea of “New India” and the “new normal” for the country under Prime Minister   and ruling  , alleging that mob justice, communal violence and atrocities against Dalits have spiked in saffron-ruled states. Amid the anger over lynching of seven persons in  , AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said, “Lawlessness aided and abetted by the state has become the new India of today. There is intolerance galore, innocents targeted, state-sponsored violence. This is the new norm.”

 He said BJP thrives on emotions and vulnerabilities of people and uses it to target those with different views and ideologies. He said police was a mute spectator to lynchings in Jharkhand, where even an 80-year-old woman was not spared. Singhvi said while Modi makes grand statements, “his factotums practise a licence to kill which would make James Bond blush”. 
 
 Calling mob justice the philosophy of the ruling dispensation, he said it was evident in the way Dalits were stripped and beaten up in Una in Gujarat, in how Dalit student Rohith Vemula was driven to suicide in Hyderabad University, in Union minister V K Singh alleged dog analogies with regard to Dalits and   being lynched by a mob in Dadri over claims of cow slaughter. Singhvi said the situation has turned so bad that 23 former bureaucrats had to urge the CM of Rajasthan to arrest the culprits who lynched dairy farmer Pehlu Khan in Jaipur recently. “How many examples - from Jammu to Rajasthan to Haryana. They are all BJP-ruled states,” he said.
