Vadodara: The rural area of Vadodara district in 2016 saw one of the biggest liquor raids in the state’s history. Even before police raided the farmhouse at Ampad village on the outskirts of the city, rural police made major crackdowns on   and liquor dens in their jurisdiction.

 According to the figures released by Vadodara rural police, their jurisdiction saw a 2.4% increase in the number of prohibition cases. “After the prohibition law was amended we have become more vigilant about bootlegging. However, we were constantly monitoring bootleggers and their activities even before that,” said superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural), Saurabh Tolumbia.
 
 The big rise was in rape cases, which rose 216.67% here over 2015. These cases also include case of minors eloping. “In most rape cases, the complaint registered is that of kidnapping of a girl. When the girl returns, her parents write to us to add the section for rape,” said a police official. There is also a 5.56% rise in cases of sexual harassment.
 
 There was a dip in the number of road accidents, which is one of the major concerns in the area as National Highway 8 and various state highways fall within the rural police jurisdiction. Tolumbia said the number of accidents in 2016 could be reduced through crime mapping. “We identified black spots in the jurisdiction of various police stations and conducted customized traffic drives for each police station,” added Tolumbia.
 
 Police also contacted the roads and buildings department to construct dividers, speed-breakers and traffic islands wherever needed.
 
 A dip was also seen in the number of major crimes like dacoity, murder, kidnapping and domestic violence. Overall, 2016 saw a 1.52% rise in crime in rural Vadodara.
