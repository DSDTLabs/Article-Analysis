PONDA: Irked by the state government’s dilly-dallying nature in increasing the rate for sugarcane produce, Goan sugarcane farmers have threatened to go on hunger strike from Thursday.

 Rajendra Desai, president of Gomantak Us Utpadak Sangatana (Goa  ' Association), an umbrella body of the sugarcane farmers, revealed that their representation met chief minister   in his chamber, on Tuesday afternoon, but the meeting was inconclusive.
 
 “Parsekar doesn’t seem keen to solve the issue and tried to postpone the matter again. We told him that the issue needs to be solved before the elections,” Desai said.
 
 The sugarcane producers presently get Rs 2,500 per metric tonne of cane supplied by them to the  , and the farmers want this rate to be hiked to Rs 3,500 per metric tonne of cane.
 
 Sources said the state government, on several occasions in the past, had assured a hike in the rate and a proposal regarding the same was moved by the managing director of the sugar factory. But the government denied the existence of such a proposal. The farmers recently met at the factory conference hall to decide on future plans and after the meeting, a group of farmers, led by Desai, met Parsekar on Tuesday.
 
 Harshad Prabhudesai, a farmer, said the present rate isn’t sufficient to even repay their  . “Each farmer takes a bank loan to cultivate sugarcane and can hardly produce about 40 metric tonnes of cane per year,” Prabhudesai said.
 
 “”Though the government claims paying a support price to the farmers, it actually pays only the rate. The same rate is also paid to Karnataka farmers,” Prabhudesai claimed.
 
 Desai declared that they would begin the hunger strike at Azad Maidan, Panaji, from Thursday.
