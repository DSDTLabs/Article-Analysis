HYDERABAD:   police found the skeletal remains of a woman near a water body on the outskirts of the city on Monday. 

 Alerted by locals, police went to a lake in Peda Toopran village and found skeletal remains of a woman in the thick vegetation next to the Venkata lake bund. 
 
 "About three months ago, unidentified persons dumped the body wrapped in a thick blanket. The body was noticed by locals on Sunday when they went to cut grass," Shamshabad inspector   said. 
 
 Except for the skull, other bones in the body were found scattered nearby and police suspect that dogs might have ripped the body apart. Cops found a brown T-shirt with 'Fashionable Girls' logo on it and pieces of damaged leggings.
 
 "We have also found a black blanket and a copper bangle with 'Om Sairam' inscribed on it at the crime scene. The victim was killed somewhere else and her body was dumped next to the lake," the inspector said. 
 
  doctors who conducted a spot post-mortem said the victim could have been in her early twenties. A femur bone was preserved for DNA analysis. A murder case was registered.
