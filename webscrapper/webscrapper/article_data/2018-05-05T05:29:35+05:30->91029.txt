MUMBAI: Two months after a 28-year-old   with a high-end   chain went  , the   detained one of her colleagues on the suspicion that she has been murdered. 

 Kirti Vyas, employed with   Salon’s Andheri (W) branch, has been untraceable since she left her residence at Bharat Nagar in   on March 16 morning. She was picked up by two of her colleagues, a couple, from near her building and dropped at Navjivan Society near Grant Road station. Her phone has been switched off since then.
 
  
 “The investigation is at a crucial stage. It has been learnt that she has been killed. We are in the process of registering a murder case,” a senior police officer told TOI, on condition of anonymity. 
 
 But the family is unaware the detention. “We have no cl-ue of any development in the missing case. In the morning, crime branch officers came home and asked questions,” said Kirti’s sister Shefali. Late on Friday, when TOI visited the crime branch unit-II at Saat Raasta, many of Kirti’s collegaues were outside the office. “One of our colleagues has been called for questioning. We have no clue about Kirti’s whereabouts,” said a colleague. 
 
 When Kirti did not return home till late at night on March 16, her family approached the D B Marg police. “In the CCTV footage, Kirti is seen leaving the building at 8.50am. A shopkeeper told the police he saw her get into a car with two people, but when my mother called her at 11am, she did not answer the call,” said Shefali. As police were making no headway in the case, the probe was handed over to crime branch unit-II.
