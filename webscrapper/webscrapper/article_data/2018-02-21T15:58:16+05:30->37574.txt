LONDON: The management of a London club soaked in Indian heritage already battling redevelopment plans have been dealt a second blow after being fined £4,122 because inspectors found the building overrun with mice.

 
 Goldsand Hotels, which runs the   and the Hotel Strand Continental in the Strand, admitted four breaches of environmental health regulations at   magistrates' court.
 
 The India Club restaurant and lounge bar was once a hub for Indian nationalists, writers, intellectuals and politicians associated with India's independence. Established in 1946 by V K Krishna Menon, India's first high commissioner to the  , it served as a meeting venue of the India League, a British organisation which campaigned for Indian independence. The club's founding members include Edwina Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru.
 
 Councillor Danny Chalkley, Cabinet member for city highways and public protection, told TOI: "There is no excuse for a dirty kitchen in any of Westminster's restaurant... Inspectors found mouse droppings and poor practice at the Strand Continental, and this fully justifies a fine of over £4,000." In a statement   said it was "deeply disappointed" by the findings of the 2016 inspection and "swiftly took action to make sure nothing similar ever happens again".
