 Recently, Naik termed Kasganj riots as ‘blot’ on the state and made his displeasure known to chief minister Yogi Adityanath.
 
 Naik was also behind PM Narendra Modi’s message to all governors to act as ambassadors of change and development and further Central government plans in their respective states. Being assertive, Naik refused to give consent on many recommendations of Akhilesh Yadav government.

 the House and read out the entire speech in his address to a joint session despite unruly behaviour by opposition legislators.
 
 Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit directed all ex-MLAs not to misuse government emblem on their letter heads when the governor pointed it out as illegal.
 
 Naik also started a new culture in Raj Bhawan by greeting senior politicians on their birthday by driving down to their residence. He was also the inspiration behind UP Foundation Day celebrations in the state.
