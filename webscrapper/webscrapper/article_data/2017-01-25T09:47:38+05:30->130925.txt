PATNA: The   (BoI) has initiated the process of auctioning the ruling JD (U) MLA Dadan Pehalwan’s assets worth Rs 1.5crore, which were attached earlier this week after his son defaulted on the repayment of a loan taken by his son. The MLA is a guarantor of his son.

 The assets include a rice mill at Dumraon in Buxar district and a plot of one and a half kattha land at Saguna Mor on the ouskirts of Patna. The rice mill belongs to Dadan’s son Kartar Singh. The principal loan amount along with interest has gone up to Rs 1.5 crore.
 
 Dadan told TOI on Tuesday evening he has consented to the BoI proposal to sell off the attached properties for recovering the loan amount.
 
 BoI sources said a letter for auctioning the MLA’s attached property has been sent to the Patna district administration. “We have sent a letter to the Patna district administration, requesting for deployment of police force for auctioning the property. We intend to complete the auctioning process within a month or two,” bank’s Patna zone deputy zonal manager Amarendra Kumar said.
 
 Dadan Singh alias Dadan Yadav alias   represents Dumraon assembly constituency for the fourth term in the Bihar assembly. A former wrestler, Pehalwan has hopped from one party to another and was earlier in the RJD, Samajwadi Party, BSP.
 
 “I have asked the bank officials to sell off the properties, recover their dues and return the remaining amount to me. I don’t remember the year when my son took the loan, but I don’t think defaulting on repayment of a loan is a big issue,” the MLA told this newspaper.
