MOHALI: A day after the sensational murder of 39-year-old Ekam Singh Dhillon in Phase 3B1, his father   on Monday said his son would not be cremated till all the accused were arrested. He also accused superintendent of police (city)   of defending accomplices of  , wife of Dhillon and the main accused.

 Seerat had confessed to shooting her husband for which a local court sent her in two-day police remand on Monday.
 
 Jaspal Singh said, “We are not going to cremate the body until a case is registered against Bhandal.” The SP had allegedly misbehaved with  , younger brother of the victim, on Sunday. Darshan and his family had demanded Seerat and others be arrested when the body was found in a suitcase from a BMW car on Sunday. This triggered an argument between the two with both threatening each other. However, Bhandal refuted the allegations.
 
 Jaspal Singh also claimed that Seerat was in illicit relationships with three friends of Ekam. “Ekam came to know about them. We want the police to arrest them,” he said. He alleged Seerat had fled from outside the house on Sunday in the car of one of her lovers. The family also met new Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh demanding a fair investigation in the case.
 
 Sources said Ekam had in the past taken Seerat to a gurdwara and asked her to swear upon the holy book that she was not having an extra-marital affair. DSP Alam Vijay said they had detained a person who was said to be having illicit relations with Sirat but he was let off as he had nothing to do with the murder case.
