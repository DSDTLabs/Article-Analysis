Sparks are flying on the sets of TV serial,   that chronicles the story of an innocent wrestler from Kusumpur, who falls in love with  , a spoilt brat from Kolkata. No, there's no romantic chemistry brewing here â€” it is, in fact, a tiff between lead actor   and   Snehasish Chakraborty. It's a classic case of who runs the show, we hear. Is it the writer/producer who churns out episodes interesting enough to keep viewers glued to their TV screens or is it the lead actor in this case? Rumours have it that the actor and the producer are giving each other cold shoulders and if Pratik doesn't forbid his ego from getting the better of him, he can soon be replaced. What happens will be interesting to see!
