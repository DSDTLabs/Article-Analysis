MUMBAI: NCP chief   said on Friday that   governor   should resign after the three-dayold BS Yeddyurappa government collapsed. Pawar said Vala's actions had damaged democracy.

 
 "I congratulate   and JD(S) MLAs for not falling prey to allurements.   should not have made haste to make Yeddyurappa chief minister when it did not have a (clear) majority," Pawar said. BJP's decision to make Yeddyurappa chief minister was a "blow to democracy", he said.
 
 "The governor of Karnataka should keep the prestige of his post intact. He, too, has dealt a blow to the democracy, and therefore he should resign," Pawar said.
