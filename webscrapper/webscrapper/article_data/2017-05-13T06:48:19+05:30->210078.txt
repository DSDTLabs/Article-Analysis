LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Friday said that it was an obligation of the state government to establish and run   in the state and the previous   had taken steps in this regard. 

 Considering that licences for meat shops and slaughter houses can be granted under the Food Safety Act, 2006, the court asked the licence-seekers to apply and directed authorities concerned to issue permits as per rules. If local authorities find any difficulty, they can approach the state government. The court directed the high-powered committee to consider the aspects set forth in the verdict and formulate the policy in the matter of slaughtering and licensing to meat shops.
 
 A bench of Justice A P   and Justice   passed the directives on a bunch of writ petitions filed individually . The petitioners had demanded that their meat shop licence, which had expired on March 31, be renewed. The petitioners had pleaded that the state wanted to close slaughterhouses and therefore it issued an order March 22. The petitioners submitted that the state action forced the closure of meat business. The act of the state indirectly put restriction on food tastes of a citizen.
