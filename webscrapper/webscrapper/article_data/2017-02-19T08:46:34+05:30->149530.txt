KANYAKUMARI: The clearing of the prosopis juliflora (karuvelam trees) by setting the bushes on fire following an order of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court has come as a blessing in disguise as it has attracted some rare winged visitors to  . Bird watchers spotted more than 10   at  , a rare phenomenon in a coastal stretch, according to them. 

 The woolly-necked stork is a medium large bird, typically 85cm tall. It is glistening black with black ‘skull cap’, white neck, white lower belly and upper parts are glossed dark green, and the breast and belly have a purple hue. It is a widespread tropical species which breeds in Asia, from India to Indonesia, and also in Africa. In India, the bird is a resident and spotted in water bodies adjacent to forest areas.
 
 The bird is listed as ‘vulnerable’ under   (IUCN). It is rare to find woolly-necked stork in coastal areas and one bird was spotted five years ago. In recent incidents, forest rescue team found an injured bird at Muttom fishing harbour on December 28, 2016. It apparently strayed into a coastal area and suffered from exhaustion. Forest department nurtured it back to health and released it later. 
 
 During the bird season, painted storks and pelicans will be seen in large number in Kanyakumari water bodies in addition to visiting flamingoes from Rann of Kutch. “There have been incidents of spotting one or two woolly-necked storks in Kanyakumari district in the past. But finding a flock of these birds is a rare incident,” said environmentalist, S S Davidson from the district.
 
 Woolly-necked storks are attracted to bush fires. Recently, the district administration started clearing prosopis julifora trees and the cleared trees are heaped and set on fire. When bush fires happen, woolly-necked storks visit the place to feed on insects and small reptiles fleeing the flames. “Setting fire to julifora trees seems to be attracting these rare birds to their unusual habitat”, Davidson added.
