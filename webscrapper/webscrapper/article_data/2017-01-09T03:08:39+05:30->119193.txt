NOIDA: Upset over delay in the delivery of houses, nearly 300 homebuyers under the banner of   Flat Owners Welfare Association ( ) held a protest on Sunday and gave call to the 10,000-odd homebuyers in the area to boycott the upcoming assembly elections.

 The protest was held from 10:30am to 2:30pm in Noida Extension. The buyers have been protesting against delay in the delivery of houses through demonstrations and social media via   for the past several months.
 
 “We have appealed to all the buyers not to cast their votes on February 11. The buyers have been taken for a ride by the builders, the state government and Noida Authority. We had expected things to be addressed before UP go to the polls, but demonetisation has slowed down matters further,” Abhishek, president, Nefowa, said.
 
 Echoing the sentiments, general secretary, Nefowa, Shweta Bharti said: “We urge all buyers who attended today’s rally to take the message far and beyond and urge all home buyers who have not been handed over houses to refrain from casting votes on February 11. We do not want to participate in an electoral process where leaders, irrespective of any party, do not really care about the home buyers’ issue.”
 
 “By delaying our projects, the builders have made the buyers suffer endlessly,” Indrish Gupta, co-founder, Nefowa, said.
 
  Extension has 58 ongoing projects with over 3 lakh units. Of these, nearly 15.000 have been handed over. The buyers claim, by 2016 end, the builders should have handed over about 1.5 lakh units to buyers.
