NEW DELHI: The government on Friday appointed  , additional secretary in the finance ministry, as the new chairman of   ( ). He will take over from   on March 1.

 The low-profile IAS officer from the Himachal Pradesh is currently handing matters related to the capital markets and his shift from North Block on the Capital’s   to the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, is seen as part of a strategy to ensure a smooth transition at the key regulatory agency.
 
 For market players, however, the 1984-batch officer is largely an unknown face. In any case, he is not known to interact much even with his colleagues in the government. “He is a strong and silent worker who comes to office early and works till late. He does not gossip or attends parties,” said a senior finance ministry officer.
 
 Although there were several senior officers in the fray, Tyagi beat them in the race as he was seen to be non-controversial and had the ability to take decisions, which will be crucial at Sebi, which now has an expanded mandate. 
 
 The appointment was made on the eve of finance minister Arun Jaitley’s post-budget meeting with the Sebi board on Saturday. 
 
 Unlike some his predecessors — Sinha, C B Bhave and M Damodaran and G N Bajpai — Tyagi has been given a five-year term, something that was not given to   when he was appointed RBI governor (Otehrs had three-year term). Though Sinha spent five years at Sebi, but not in one stint.
 
 Apart from Bajpai, all Sebi chairmen have been IAS officers, although others had worked outside the government set-up for a while before moving into a regulatory role. For instance, Bhave set up NSDL, Damodaran was with IDBI Bank and Sinha was at UTI Asset Management Company.
 
 Although Tyagi has been dealing with the capital markets sector for over two years, he has worked across several sectors — from rural development to steel, petroleum and environment and forest.
