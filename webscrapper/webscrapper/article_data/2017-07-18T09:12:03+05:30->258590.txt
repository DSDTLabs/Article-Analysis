MUMBAI: Australia's loss has turned out to be Afghanistan's gain. Earlier this month, a   involving the A teams of hosts India, hosts South Africa and Australia was in danger of being scrapped after the Australia A cricketers pulled out of the tour on the eve of their departure due to an ongoing bitter pay dispute with Cricket Australia ( ).

 However, TOI has learnt that the Tri-series, scheduled to begin from July 26, is now very much on, with   replacing Australia A. Confirming the development, Atif Mashal, the chairman of the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB), said: “Yes. The team will be captained by Shafiqullah Shafaq and coached by Lalchand Rajput.”
 
 Shafaq, a wicketkeeper, created T20 history recently when he slammed a double hundred in a T20 game (214 runs off mere 71balls) in a domestic game in Afghanistan. Rajput is a former India opener and coach who was recently interviewed for the position of India coach before the job went to Ravi Shastri. The Afghanistan A team is likely to be without their star players, leg-spinner Rashid Khan and off-spinner Mohammad Nabi on a tour which should provide good exposure to talented cricketers from the country , which gained Test status only last month.
 
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, batting legend Rahul Dravid, who was controversially appointed as the overseas batting consultant by the BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) is set to skip the tour of Sri Lanka and accompany the   team to South Africa instead. Manish Pandey will lead the India A team in the Tri-series, while Karun Nair will be the captain for the two four-day games in Benoni and Potchefstroom in August.
 
 Dravid is likely to be accompanied by ex-India pacer Paras Mhambrey as the bowling coach of the team.
