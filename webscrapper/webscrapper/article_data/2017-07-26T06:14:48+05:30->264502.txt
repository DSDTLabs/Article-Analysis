MUMBAI: Six accounts of three banks have come under the  's scanner after it was found that a gang used them to   Rs 74 lakh of a victim looking for a suitable groom. 

  TOI had reported (July 20) about the plight of a 40-year-old woman who became a victim of the gang. Amar Joshi posed as a UK national on a matrimonial site, became friendly with the victim and later, under the pretext of being caught by Customs at Delhi and Mumbai airports for getting extra UK currency, extracted Rs 74 lakh. He told the victim he had to pay Customs duty and got her to deposit money in some accounts. During investigations it transpired that most of the money was deposited in accounts of Aryan Karyavan, Vijay Traders, Sachin Kumar and K Sharma. 
 
 "Most of the accounts were dummy or belonged to non-existing customers with zero balance. Immediately after the money was deposited, he either transferred it to other accounts or withdrew it from ATMs. We are trying to figure out accounts where the money was transferred," said an officer privy to the investigations. Police said people often give their accounts for use by gangs for 10% commission of the amount deposited. "Why should all the work be done by police? Is it not the responsibility of bank officials to check the accounts? It is the negligence of bank officials, otherwise how could these   have been operating in the city for so many years?" added another officer.
 
 Police blamed matrimonial sites for not having foolproof systems to counter fake profiles. "The Bandra victim was duped by a conman who posed as a UK national on the site in May. He uploaded somebody else's photo and put a fake number. There is no verification by the sites to even confirm if the man has uploaded a genuine photo of has given correct information," he said.
