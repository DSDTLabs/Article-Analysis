Bareilly:  's crime branch has busted a gang that was allegedly processing high-quality heroin and smuggling it to several states, including Delhi and  . Officials said that the raw material for the drug was sourced from farmers within and outside the state. 

  "Poppy farmers dilute their produce to keep aside some opium to sell it to drug traders. They make huge profits out of it as the margins multiply after each processing," SP (crime) Ramesh Bhartiya told TOI. 
 
  A week ago, a carrier named Naeem was arrested by  's crime branch with 4kg of high-grade heroin worth Rs 16 crore in the international market. Following this,   police was involved in the case and it managed to trace Bhola, the kingpin of the gang.
 
  Officials said that over the years, Bareilly has infamously acquired the status of 'the hub of drug trade and trafficking in UP'. Police and   have conducted several raids and made numerous arrests, but apparently this hasn't deterred the people involved in the business. 
 
  The trade further got a shot in the arm after opium production was closely monitored by the Centre and only a handful of farmers were issued licences for cultivation.
 
  "The raw material was readily available in the past, but that is not the case now. This has directly affected the price of the end product against the rising demand," said an officer in the crime branch team trying to trace drug traders in the region. 
 
 "The gang has a unique modus operandi. The carrier is given a new mobile and a SIM card every time he is out to deliver a consignment. The carrier hands over the drugs as well as the mobile to the person to whom the consignment is delivered," SP Bhartiya added. 
 
 According to a crime branch official, there are several pockets in the outskirts of the city which are infamous for drug trade, that is spreading across state borders.
