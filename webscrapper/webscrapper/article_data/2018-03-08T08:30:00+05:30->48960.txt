There are 78 sports academies in the country, whereas China has six lakh such academies. I’m the coach of a national team but I have to double up as a physiotherapist, psychologist and counsellor. In contrast, a sports team from other nations generally has a head coach and several other trainers.”

 Experts also spoke of the need to include sports education in the school curriculum.
 
   , director (skill development), CII, said: “To ensure India plays sports, we need to inculcate it in our students. From the next academic year, CBSE will have one exam on sports education. It will be mandatory for kids to clear this exam, like any other subject. We need to change the mindset of people in this country, and we can only do that by educating our younger generation about sports.”
