NEW DELHI:   on Saturday registered an FIR against AAP   from Uttam Nagar Naresh Balyan for his speech in which he allegedly incited people for violence and called for attacking public servants.

 
 According to the police, the case was registered after Balyan delivered a speech on Friday near a JJ colony in west Delhi’s Bindapur. The meeting was attended by over 500 people.
 
  
  
 
 The police complaint stated that Balyan was heard justifying the assault on Delhi’s chief secretary Anshu Prakash. According to the FIR, Balyan said: “I say that such officers should be beaten up and assaulted. Whoever is sitting by and stopping the work of the ‘aam aadmi’ should be treated this way.”
 
 Police officers present at the meeting in Bindapur said that a number of people in the crowd cheered and affirmed with the statements that were made in the meeting and reportedly responded by saying that “they would go to government offices and behave in the same way with officers present there.”
 
 Cops said that the content of the video was examined and subsequently, a case under sections 189 (threat of injury to public servant), 505-1 (statement conducing to public mischief), 116 (abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC was registered.
 
 Reacting to the police action,   Delhi chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj accused the BJP of controlling the Delhi Police. 
 
 “BJP controls the Delhi Police and they file ten more FIRs on AAP MLAs. Video evidence is also available for IAS officers who have beaten state ministers and the Delhi Dialogue Commission vice-chairman. Why is there not a single arrest? Is it not politics?” Bharadwaj questioned.
