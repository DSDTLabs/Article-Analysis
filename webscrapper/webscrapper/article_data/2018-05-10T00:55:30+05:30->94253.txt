Chandigarh: The Amarinder Singh cabinet on Tuesday approved lowering of pass marks from 66.66% to 50% for criminal law and revenue law papers that PCS and IAS officers need to clear so that power of executive magistrate, assistant collector or collector can be vested in them.

 However, the bureaucrats will still need to pass in higher standard (66.66%) to clear their probation/promotion.
 
 The changes have been approved in view of the fact that a large number of officers do not score the prescribed marks in criminal law and revenue law papers in their first or second attempts. Hence, when such officers are posted as sub-divisional magistrates etc, they cannot be vested with powers of executive magistrate or assistant collector Grade-I or collector. Consequently, they are not able to perform their duties effectively.
 
 The cabinet approved an amendment in the Rule-12 of the Civil Services (Departmental Examination) Punjab Rules, 2014, for the posts of assistant commissioner and extra assistant commissioner.
 
 The marks have been cleared although all candidates are allowed to consult reference books while answering questions for departmental examinations.
 
 Till now, the officers needed to obtain 66.66% marks in revenue and criminal law papers, and 55% marks in civil law, developmental laws, industrial and commercial laws, local government laws and public service laws. The examination is held thrice annually — in February, June and October.
 
 This February, out of 39 PCS officers who had appeared for the departmental examination of assistant commissioners in Chandigarh, only 12 passed the revenue law paper, considered to be the toughest.
 
 As per the civil services (departmental examination) Punjab Rules, 2014, “All the members of service, shall qualify the examination within a period of one-and-a-half-years from the date of their appointment to the service. The members of the service shall be given only four chances.”
