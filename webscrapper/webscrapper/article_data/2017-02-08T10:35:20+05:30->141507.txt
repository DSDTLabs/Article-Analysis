PATIALA:   has decided to ask   (SAD) chief   to act against those in the party who he feels tried to   in  .

 SAD had triggered a political coup of sorts by declaring the first Sikh Army chief of India as its candidate against Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh in his own den.Amarinder, however, had refused to get rattled and had continued to campaign for the Congress across Punjab instead of getting tied down to Patiala.
 
 The SAD candidate is believed to have met Sukhbir in Delhi. The Punjab deputy chief minister is camping there for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elec tions. The General is believed to have complained against two prominent Akali leaders from Patiala.
 
 Without naming the leaders, General told TOI, “I have sought strong action against the two leaders. One of them was spotted touching Captain's feet on election day .The other deserted my campaign just prior to the elections and was reportedly helping the rival camps,“ he said.
 
 “I have produced evidence before the party chief which substantiates the allegations,“ he added. “I went to their (leaders') homes and sought an explanation. They had nothing to say . They promised extensive support, but they were seen assuring Captain. I will not tolerate such indiscipline,“ the General contended. “These leaders have let the party down and should be suspended.“
 
 The General had expressed unhappiness with the `indiscipline' in his party during the campaign and had pulled up local leaders more than once.
 
 A local Akali leader in Patiala on the other hand said, “He (General) should have left behind his Army baggage when he joined politics.Many are relieved that the election process is over.“
