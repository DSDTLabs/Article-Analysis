SURAT: At least 168 passengers from the city, bound for New Delhi, were stranded at the airport here after   (AI) cancelled its   AI494 flight on Saturday morning. 

 Angry scenes were witnessed at the airport as the passengers gheraoed the AI staff for providing late information to them when many had already reached the airport with their luggage to board the Delhi-bound Airbus. 
 
 Sources said the passengers demanded that the airline make alternative arrangement for their Delhi travel. However, the AI arranged taxis for a few passengers who could not wait at the airport. Passengers were taken to Vadodara to board another flight towards Delhi. 
 
 An angry passenger told TOI, “They (AI) knew that the Airbus was cancelled from Delhi, then why did they keep us waiting at the airport for more than an hour? The staff made the announcement late and by then we had given our luggage for security check.”
 
 Another passenger said, “This happens with Surat invariably. AI is using old aircraft on   route, despite many representations to AI management.”
 
  president Sanjay Ezhawa said, “We have written to minister of civil aviation and AI chairman and managing director asking them to find a permanent solution to the problem. Each time, AI gives excuse of technical fault for delay and cancellation of flights.” 
 
 Sources said that AI had arranged another aircraft for remaining passengers travelling to Delhi. The aircraft arrived at about 7:30pm.
