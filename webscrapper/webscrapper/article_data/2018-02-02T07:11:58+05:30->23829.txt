 After private school managements challenged the Gujarat high court order upholding the Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act for fee regulation, the apex court has asked the state government to reconstitute fee fixation committees, and include a retired high court judge. The apex court has also directed that the revision authority be reconstitued with two retired high court judges.
 
 The provisional fee caps fixed currently are Rs 15,000; Rs 25,000; and Rs 27,000 for primary, secondary and higher secondary sections . This will be revised after hearing school managements and each representative of parents’ associations supporting and opposing the fee regulation law. The government will have to make it clear how it will take people’s view into consideration, said advocate Vishal Dave who appears for parents’ association.
 
 The Supreme Court has made it clear that all fee structures will be provisional and will not be finalized without the apex court’s nod.
 
 An appeal against the fee structure will be finalized by the revision committee in the next 30 days. The SC has fixed time limits for all these processes and posted further hearing on May 3.
 
 The SC has ordered schools to submit their proposals in two weeks’ time after fee caps are finalized. The state government, meanwhile, has deferred its decision on finalization of fees for 118 schools.
