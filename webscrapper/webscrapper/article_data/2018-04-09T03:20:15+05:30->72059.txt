KOLKATA:   accident   Riyan Nayak (3), was kept off ventilation for over 12 hours on Sunday, before he was put on external respiratory support system again. 

 "Doctors kept him off ventilation with minimum artificial oxygen support from 6am to 7pm. However, his condition started getting a bit unstable in the evening so he was again put back on support," said a relative.
 
 On Saturday, Riyan opened his eyes for the first time since last week and even called out his mother. But on Sunday, he was unable to recognise any of his family members. "He couldn't identify anyone on Sunday. Doctors said it's normal during such head injuries and asked us not to panic. We are keeping our fingers crossed," the relative added.
 
 Riyan's sister  , who was taken out of ICU on Saturday, complained of vision problem. "Doctors are checking her. She is complaining of blurred vision in the right eye," the relative said.
