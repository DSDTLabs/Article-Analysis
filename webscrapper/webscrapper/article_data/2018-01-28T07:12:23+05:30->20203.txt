NEW DELHI: Amid talk in opposition circles to seek impeachment of Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra after four senior-most judges recently raised concerns over allocation of cases, BJP spokesperson and Supreme Court lawyer   accused   and the Left parties of politicising the apex court. 

 Four senior-most Supreme Court judges – Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur, and   — raised concerns over allocation of sensitive cases to particular Benches at a press conference on January 12, unprecedented in India’s judicial history.
 
 “The Supreme Court is an extremely respected and eminent institution in our constitutional scheme as well as democratic structure... Every judge who makes it to the   is an institution by himself or herself. It is unfortunate and condemnable that Congress and the Left parties are seeking to politicise the SC by making such statements in public domain," Kohli said. 
 
 The BJP leader said one wonders whether they are trying to intimidate the institution. 
 
 "However, the Left leader  , who is talking about the CJI impeachment, is himself impeached by his own party. He has resorted to this gimmick to save his own existence,” Kohli said, adding, "The Congress leadership will do well to recall the shameful assault on the judiciary and in particular the Supreme Court in the 70s during the Emergency period."
 
 He said the BJP was one of the worst sufferers of Emergency and its commitment to protect the dignity of the SC remains intact.
