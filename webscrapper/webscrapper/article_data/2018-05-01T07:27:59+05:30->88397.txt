KOCHI: With the district collector set to pass a notification officially marking a section of MG Road as a no-horn zone, psychologist suggests abusive application of car horns is a behavioural defect and needs to be brought under control.

 “If you want to know the psyche of the city, all you need to do is step out on the road. You can see the display of impatience in the driving culture of the people. The reason why people display such behaviour on the road showing a complete lack of concern with no regards as to how their actions impact the society is because they feel their vehicle is a safe space for them. If they behave in a similar way elsewhere then they will face some sort of repercussions,” said clinical psychologist, Dr CJ John.
 
 He said that abusive use of car horn was a behavioural problem and must be treated as one. “It is a display of frustration. They do so without concern for the people around. It is important that at such times friends and passengers point it out to them and take the matter seriously,” said Dr John.
 
 Clinical psychologist Dr   said that such inebriations in   could only be brought down by disciplining them and that aggressive awareness programmes will help the process.
 
 “In  , Malayalis do not discipline themselves but once they cross the borders of the state they are completely in control. I would even suggest that placing fines would also serve as a solution to curb excessive honking,” said Dr Philip.
 
 He said aggressive honking at red signals often had problems such as attention deficit and internal restlessness and hence incapable of tolerating delay.
 
 “We are often trying to let out our anger and frustrations using the horn needlessly. This, in turn, affects the state of the mind of the others, creating a vicious circle, where one person’s actions affect others on the road and hence creating a domino effect. And because we have been accepting this sort of behaviour, we normalized it,” said Dr C J John.
