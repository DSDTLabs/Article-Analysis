“Everyone wanted a change, I not only wanted change, but wanted to be the change and here I am,” says  , the newly elected president of the Tamil Film Producers’ Council ( ). He is also the general secretary of Nadigar Sangam. Will he be holding posts in both these bodies? “Yes, I will tirelessly work for both,” he replies. So, who will he stand by if a conflict arises between these two bodies? He says, “First of all, I don’t want any conflict to arise. It is to avoid such situations that my team and I are here. But unfortunately, if one such situation arises, I will stand for justice.” 

 Ask him about his immediate plans as the president of the TFPC, and he says, “So many small films are lying in the cans waiting for a theatrical release. I plan to meticulously work towards their release as many small film producers will benefit from that. Also, our late CM, Jayalalithaa madam had assured that state awards would be announced soon, but that could not happen at that point. So, I will request the government to conduct the award function as soon as possible.” 
 
 Vishal has been consistently acting against piracy, even before the elections. Having won the elections now, what measures does he have to take on this threat to the industry? “Now, the battle has begun. The guys who indulge in   will have to look for other jobs. I will block each and every possible loophole that gives room for piracy. I have plans to create a separate team to keep a track on movie piracy. Each and every piracy issue will be taken up and addressed. I will work towards a ‘no piracy’ state in Tamil cinema.”
