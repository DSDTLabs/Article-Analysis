HYDERABAD: The issue of chief minister   not garlanding BR Ambedkar's statue on his birth anniversary was embroiled in a controversy. So much so that municipal administration minister KT   faced some rough moments and was questioned about the CM's "reluctance" by a member of the audience at a function to honour recepients of Dr Ambedkar T-PRIDE awards at   on Saturday. 

 As Rama Rao rose to speak at the Rapid Incubation of Dalit Entrepreneurs' (T-PRIDE) awards function, a person from the audience spoke loudly questioning the minister.  , who was taken aback, sent someone from the dais to find out the man's grievance. The minister repeatedly asked the person to sit down and not disrupt 'a good' function. "Anna (elder brother), I cannot see you. Please sit down," the minister pleaded. When the person kept shouting, the minister said, "Please make him sit. Somebody please take care of him."
 
 On being informed that the person was demanding to know why the CM had not garlanded the statue of Ambedkar, Rama Rao said all ministers had participated in functions in districts and garlanded the statues. "Perhaps, you are not aware of this. We rushed to the city to participate in this function," he told the man. 
 
 "We do not do things in a customary way. Our deeds speak for us," the minister said as he spoke about the initiatives to help Dalits entrepreneurs. "In Gujarat (where   is in power), they only talk, but ours is a government which actually works for the welfare of Dalits," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the CM said in a statement that Ambedkar understood the Indian society completely and would remain an inspiration for several generations.
