 KS (name changed), a resident of   and trader, is shattered. His   is now stuck with  , which has been accused of cheating hundreds of investors of crores of rupees.

 Praveen told TOI it all started in 2008, when a friend introduced him to the company and told him about the good returns. “I invested about Rs 2 lakh to start with and was happy to get annual returns in the range of 40% to 45%. Encouraged by this, I made four more investments in the names of my family members,” he added.
 
 All this was meant to save money for his family’s dream home. “All went well till end of last year and we had a total investment of about Rs 50 lakh. We hadn’t withdrawn any money and didn’t get any doubt about the company as there was no hitch all these years,” he said.
 
 The problem started in January 2017, when the returns began dwindling. “Whenever we checked, the company guys would say they have some problems with their bank and it would be settled soon. Like many investors, I too waited in hope, only to get this shocker,” he said.
 
 Praveen said he’ll lodge a police complaint on Wednesday as he couldn’t do it in the past two days.
