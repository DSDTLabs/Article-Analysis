JAIPUR: The   of UK on Wednesday observed the 175th anniversary of   being made a Fellow. Darwin, as a young 29-year-old scientist, was honoured with the title 20 years before he published On the Origin of Species, coming to be known as ‘Father of Evolution’.

 International Business Standard reproduced on its website the certificate showing Darwin’s election date, 24 January 1839, signed off by members of the Royal Society.
 
 The website quoted Keith Moore, librarian at the Royal Society: “Charles Darwin was one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century or indeed of any age for his work on evolution by natural selection. What’s wonderful about his becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society is that it came twenty years before the publication of On the Origin of Species (1859) while he was still sorting, distributing and thinking about his specimen collections from the Beagle voyage. Darwin’s potential for scientific achievement was recognized.”
 
 In Origin, Darwin showed that all species on Earth descended from common ancestors. He has been recognized since then as among the most influential people in human history. He featured in news in India recently, after Union minister of state for human resource development Satyapal Singh claimed that evolution was not true, for no one had seen humans emerge from apes. The minister has since been advised to exercise restraint by HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.
 
 Darwin toured South America and the Pacific on a vessel called the Beagle for five years from December 1831, making natural history collections and writing extensive notes of his findings. At the  , he found evidence to support his theory of evolution. International Business Times reports that Darwin’s father considered the journey a waste of time.
