 Talking about her character in the show, she says, “My character’s name is Gulguli. It may sound funny, but she is a strong woman.

 She adds, “Even today, women are struggling for equal status in the society and that’s what the show will portray. The recent New Year incident in Bengaluru has left me disturbed and I think it is high time that we start thinking on the upbringing of our boys. They must be taught to respect women.”
