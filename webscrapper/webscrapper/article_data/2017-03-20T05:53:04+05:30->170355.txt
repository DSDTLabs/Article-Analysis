NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades after he first flew in a plane,   co-founder and CEO Brian   may just be on course to rework your flying experience. 

 From a “bus in the sky”, Chesky wants an aircraft to feel more like a “home in the sky”. 
 
 He said the global aviation industry may soon get a makeover with electric airplanes and other innovations.
 
 “There is going to be a revolution in aviation. We would like to support that... We may or may not participate in it because we are figuring that out. But we will be part of it in some way,” Chesky told TOI as he sat down for an interview after negotiating a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam.
 
 
 
 
 The 36-year-old, who co-founded the $30 billion start-up in 2008 after he could not find a hotel room in San Francisco, sees India as an emerging market but keeps reiterating that Airbnb is betting longterm, given that the country is growing fast and has one of the world’s largest middleclass populations, which will expand further. While he is not looking to personally invest in India, at least immediately, the focus is on strengthening the presence of Airbnb, which is seeing around 200% growth here. 
 
 He is focusing on selling experiences such as ‘Trips’, a new feature that allows an Airbnb user to get a local feel —from truffle hunting in   to learning how to drape a sari in 20 different ways in India. Chesky said the company, which now goes beyond offering rooms and music to travel experiences, will slowly expand its product portfolio in India
