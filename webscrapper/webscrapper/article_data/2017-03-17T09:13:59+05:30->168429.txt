GUWAHATI: A top   functionary said on Thursday that the leaflet issued against teenage singer  's programme, slated for March 25, was an “appeal“, not a  .

  claimed a fatwa needs to have a formal seal of its issuing authorities. The state Jamiat secretary, however, maintained that many signatories to the appeal have the authority to issue fatwas.
 
 Despite the adverse reactions evoked by the leaflet within and outside the country, Qasimi hailed the “appeal“ issued in the name of 46 clerics. He said, “This is very relevant to the present time but it can't be called a fatwa. A fatwa is issued when an act is committed in violation of the Sharia and bears the seal and signature of the authorised person who issues it. It (the leaflet) is an appeal because it doesn't have the seal or signature of the people who have issued it.“
 
 Qasimi said, “The appeal was meant for the Biradarone Millat (Muslim brothers) to avoid programmes like Afrin's musical night, but not against the singer. It is up to her if she listens to the appeal.We won't stop her from going ahead with the programme.“
 
 He added, “Our objective is to educate the greater Assamese society against social and cultural evils who hold cultural nights at a venue surrounded by a madrassa, a masjid and a graveyard. Nahid, too, is part of the society.“
