THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In what could be termed as scant disregard for the stipulations of   (UGC),   syndicates have recommended the names of two   as nominees to the search committees being set up for the selection of vice-chancellors to the universities. 

 According to sources, Kannur University syndicate has recommended CPM leader and former MLA Prakasan Master as the member of the search committee while the Sanskrit university syndicate recommended MLA T V Rajesh to the panel. However, the governor, who is also the chancellor of the universities has rejected both the recommendations. "The chancellor has refused to accept the names of the CPM leaders as members of the search committees and rejected the file sent to him by the state government," sources said.
 
 The office of education minister C Raveendranath, meanwhile, said that the government had decided to go by the stipulations in the UGC regulations on the selection of VCs and PVCs to various universities.
 
 For months together, the post of VC in Kannur and Sanskrit universities were lying vacant. Similarly, the government has not appointed new PVCs in MG University, Cusat and Kannur University.
 
 As per the UGC regulations, the university syndicate should recommend an academic expert as the nominee of the university to the search committee set up by the chancellor for the selection of VC. The other members of the committee would be a representative of UGC and a nominee of the chancellor. Normally, governor choses the state chief secretary as his nominee in the search committee.
 
 Sources said the governor was of the opinion that the university syndicates could recommend any academically qualified hand competent enough to become the member of the panel. Since the state government has decided to go by the UGC guidelines, only those candidates with 10 years of teaching experience in the capacity of professor would be considered for the post of VCs.
