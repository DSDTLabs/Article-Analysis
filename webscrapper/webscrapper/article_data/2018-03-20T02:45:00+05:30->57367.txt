Visakhapatnam: Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda) will seek the services of a ‘project management consultant’ for its ambitious multi-level grade separator (flyover) at the busy   junction of the city. The PMC will assist   in construction supervision, quality assurance and auditing the designs of the   throughout the construction. The PMC will also help the contractor of the project in obtaining necessary permissions and approvals.

 Vuda vice-chairman P Basanth Kumar said that the NAD flyover designs are currently being vetted by the National Institute of Technology-Warangal. “The design evaluation process may take another one week. The contractor is likely to launch the works in the first week of April,” said Basanth Kumar.
 
 Vuda superintending engineer KVN Ravi explained the role of the PMC in the project. “The PMC would play the role of a specialist in the execution of the project,” said Ravi.
 
 Right from the inception report, the consultant will prepare fortnightly progress reports, quarterly progress reports and final report in one month after completion of the project. The PMC will also take care of liaison meetings between the Vuda officials and the contractor at monthly intervals to deliberate upon the contents of the progress reports, pertinent issues and financial matters.
 
 Vuda has already released the mobilisation advance to the Vijay Nirman Company Private Limited who bagged the project.
 
 The flyover project was proposed back in 2015 as a long-term measure to ease the ever growing traffic at this busiest   of Visakhapatnam.
