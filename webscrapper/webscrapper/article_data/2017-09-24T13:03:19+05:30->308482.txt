CHENNAI: In a big relief to   chairman TR   alias Parivendhar, the Supreme Court has directed 136 parents/teachers who had lodged complaints against him to file affidavits in Madras high court saying they had no objection to quash the criminal proceedings against the educationist.

 “On filing the affidadivts, the high court shall quash the proceedings arising out of the FIR,” said a division bench of   and Justice   on Friday. Till the FIR is quashed the amount shall not be disbursed to the aggrieved parents, who must file individual affidavits.
 
 After paying several lakh rupees to S Madhan for for PG medical seats in   university last year, the parents lodged cheating case against him as well as Pachamuthu since they got neither admissions nor refund of the money. Madhan staged a suicide drama and disappeared for months, before being arrested from a hideout in Tirupur.
 
 In order to secure bail, Pachamuthu deposited Rs 75 crore, and another Rs 10 crore. However, last week, Madras high court refused to quash the case even though it asked aggrieved parents to furnish proof and take refund from out of the deposit. It also named a retired judge as administrator.
 On Friday, however, the apex court recorded the submissions of the parents that they had no objection to quashing the case against Pachamuthu. It also made it clear that Pachamuthu too should be involved in the disbursal process so that he would be able to verify that only genuine persons had filed affidavits and received payments.
