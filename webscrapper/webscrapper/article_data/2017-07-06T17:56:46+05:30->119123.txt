He claims that  , who plays the parallel lead, is his friend. And he is shocked at rumours of him getting upset with   because he got more support from the audience during a screening of the first episode of the show.
A source said, “The crowd cheered happily for Ankit when he made an entry on stage after the screening. Due to this reason,   felt a little left out as the audience had to yet warm up to him. He immediately left and refused to take anyone’s calls for the entire day.”
 Harshad, said, “Firstly, Ankit and I don’t shoot together, so there is no question of rivalry or competition here. I did leave early on the day of the screening as I had to pick up a friend from the airport. People should not see much into this. Ankit is a good friend and I share a great rapport with him.” 
 When contacted, Ankit also dismissed the incident as gossip. “I heard about these silly rumours, but it is not true. I am not shooting with Harshad right now so how will there be tension?” he added.
