CHANDIGARH: A day a fire broke out in a second-floor room of PU girls’ hostel number 3, a senior official said a team visited all hostels on Saturday and decided to form a committee to identify fire hazards at student accommodations.

  dean of student welfare ( ) Prof   said electrical wiring and fire-fighting infrastructure at the hostels would be checked after the formation of the committee, which would comprise all hostel wardens and an executive engineer.
 
 He said PU would call a meeting of its electricity department on Monday to direct it to install meters that cut power supply to a room in case one exceeds the power load limit. “The university already has this system in the new block of girls’ hostel number 6,” he said.
 
 On Saturday, when the hostel room caught fire, no fire   as there was no warning system in the hostel. PU registrar Col G S   (retd) said the university would install fire alarms in all hostels and carry out regular drills and practices to use fire-safety equipment.
