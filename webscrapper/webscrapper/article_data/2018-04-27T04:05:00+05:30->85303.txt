Vadodara: A labourer allegedly stabbed his father to death in Sankad village of Chhota Udepur’s Naswadi taluka after the latter refused to give him money late on Wednesday night.

 A week ago, the accused Raisingh Dungra Bhil had returned to his village from Saurashtra where he worked as a farm labourer . Police said that since he had returned, Raisingh kept borrowing money from his father Rama every day and spent the cash on his bad habits like liquor.
 
 On Wednesday night, Raisingh and his wife were talking outside their house where his father was also present. Later, he asked him to lend Rs 10,000. When Rama refused to give the money, the duo got into heated arguments. Rama told his son to use the money he earned as farm labourer in Saurashtra instead of asking around.
 
 A police official said that Rama’s arguments enraged Raisingh following which he stabbed his father in the chest with a knife that he was carrying. Hearing Rama’s cries for help, his second son Dinesh and wife rushed out. Dinesh told the police that as Rama collapsed, Raisingh and his wife Geeta fled away from there.
 
 Before the family could rush Rama to a nearby health centre, he had already died.
