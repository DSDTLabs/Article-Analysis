They say the show must go on! And, this holds true for actor  . Work commitment made him fly off to   just a day after explosions took place in the city. 

 He says, “I was shocked to hear about this terrible incident. We were constantly following up on the news. I checked with my contacts in   and was assured that there was nothing to worry. I will be there for a month-long shoot. My family is concerned for my safety, but I have told them that there is nothing to worry. I am sure that I’ll be taken care of. However, such incidents make you feel that life is unpredictable. Anything can happen anywhere.”
