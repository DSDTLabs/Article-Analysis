PANAJI: People who have   their vehicles in various nooks and corners of   may have to part with them for good. A survey by the city’s traffic   has revealed that 199 vehicles have been identified as ‘abandoned’ within the limits of Panaji. Of these, 101 are two-wheelers, 93 are four-wheelers and five are autorickshaws.

 The owners have been requested by the traffic police to remove these vehicles within seven days, after which a fresh survey will be conducted. A list of vehicles still lying at the spot will then be sent to the North Goa district magistrate and the commissioner of the Corporation of the City of Panaji ( ) to begin the auctioning process after a notice is served to the respective owners.
 
 “From the looks of these vehicles, it is evident that they have not been used for a number of days and are occupying precious parking space in Panaji city. Some businessmen are using these vehicles as storerooms/godowns to keep their goods. Even some junk vehicles are found parked on the road,” the notice issued by authorities read.
 
 The Motor Vehicles Act deems that any vehicle left unattended for more than 10 hours will be considered an abandoned vehicle. 
 
 In the past, around 50 such   were auctioned by the CCP after the owners failed to claim them.
