HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum has directed a private firm selling 'Ayurveda inspired products' to pay a compensation of 1.2 lakh to a consumer, who complained of developing black patches and   after using its weight-loss products. 

 K Prabhakar, the complainant, submitted that in the last week of March 2015, had visited a medical camp conducted by   at  , where the doctor suggested that he use the products. He claimed that the firm neither gave him a prescription nor a receipt stating that was against company policy. The 'medicines', he said, comprised dietary supplements,protein supplements etc, which he consumed from April to December, 2015.
 
 In the first week of December, he noticed that they were having adverse effects, causing black shades, and irritation on face, hands and legs. He immediately informed the firm about the side effects, met them personally, sent a registered post seeking a solution , but got no response. Claiming that this 'abnormal condition' affected him both physically and mentally, he filed a complaint seeking compensation. In defence, the firm, submitted that the products were not medicines, but only dietary supplements, licensed by the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India . They claimed that the alleged problems were caused because the complainant used the product in violation of the prescribed dosage. Their argument was not entertained by the bench which termed the firm's statement as "immature". 
 
 "They cannot find fault in the complainant in the absence of any medical certificate. Also, though they proudly acclaimed that their products were certified by 'FSSAI', they failed to file any license or certificate issued by that agency to prove their products are safe to all types of customers and non-hazardous. Hence, the opposite parties have failed to defend their own contention," the bench observed.
