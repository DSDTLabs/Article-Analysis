Yet,  , 32, and  , 23, can’t thank their lucky stars enough after escaping death by a whisker in Thursday’s accident. “I know my earning will be zero over the next few days as my auto was confiscated by police as evidence on Thursday. 

 But I feel lucky after getting released from the hospital,” said Chakraborty, who has been playing his auto from Ruby to   for last 13 years. When the bus rammed his auto, Chakraborty thought it was his end . “Even in the hospital, I kept asking doctors whether my limbs were intact. The deadly sound of the crash is still resonating in my ear,” he shuddered. 
 
 
  
 Chakraborty is uncertain when his auto will be released from the police station. “I have already spoken to our union leaders and they all have agreed to help me in getting it released soon.

It hit the auto before I could react,” said Roy.
