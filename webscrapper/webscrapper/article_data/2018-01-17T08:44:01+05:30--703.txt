COIMBATORE: The civic body will soon sell biodegradable   bags at stalls to be set up inside the corporation premises to popularise the same among the public.

 Under the smart city mission, the civic body had held meetings with the hotelier association, catering association, corporates, marriage hall owners, small shop owners and city residents to create awareness about   bags that are soluble in hot water.
 
 “We are getting enquires about the bags. People want to be part of the change, but do not know how to get these bags. To introduce them in the market, we will set up a stall inside the corporation campus. All the alternative products for plastic will be available there. It will be a one-stop shop,” said an official.
 
 The first stall will be set up inside the main corporation building campus at   in a few weeks, a source confirmed. For this, officials have received the nod from the city corporation commissioner, K Vijakarthikeyan. He told TOI that the stall will be set up soon. “The bags will be sold at the same rates they are purchased at,” he said.
 
 Apart from the bio-degradable bags, spoons, cups and other alternatives will be for sale at the stalls. “The cost of bags will range between Rs 1.90 and Rs 6. People who are looking for alternatives for other plastic items such as cups can also find them in the stall,” said an official. Regular programmes will be held at temples, wedding halls and other public events to create awareness on these alternatives as well.
 
 Once it becomes popular, the bags will be sold at every shop and the civic body may set up stalls in all corporation offices, the official added.
