SRINAGAR: In a snub to the Central government’s unilateral suspension of all offensive operations against terrorists in Kashmir, terror outfits dared security forces in at least two gun-battles, blasted a bomb and snatched a service rifle of a constable across the Valley on Wednesday. 

 A joint team of army’s 23 PARA Commandos, SOG and CRPF launched a cordon-andsearch operation at Jamnagri area of south Kashmir’s Shopian district. As the forces were zeroing in on a specified target, terrorists hiding in the area opened fire which was retaliated by the forces, triggering off a gunfight, sources said.
 
 However, sympathisers rushed to help the terrorists escape from the hide-out, by throwing stones on the security forces who were engaged in the encounter. Four persons were reportedly injured in the clashes. Sources said the terrorists managed to escape from the spot.
 
 Before the announcement of the unilateral ceasefire, a brief exchange of firing took place between security forces and terrorists in Tral forests, a police official said.
 
 Two civilians were injured in a bomb blast near Pincho Mandi in Chatabal area of Srinagar old city on Srinagar highway to Baramulla.
 
 In another incident, two pistol-borne terrorists entered   at Hazratbal from Rumi Gate, overpowered the constable on guard duty and snatched his service rifle. 
 
 “They are even snatching rifles outside Kashmir University now. It doesn’t look like any place in Kashmir is safe any longer,” former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted.
