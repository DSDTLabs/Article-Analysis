Guntur: Unlicensed agro traders are making a killing in rural areas, thanks to tacit support from various government departments. 

 The merchants, trading bio-fertilizers, bio-chemicals and spurious seeds, are brazenly handling high-volume sales by setting up swanky shops with big hoardings at main centres of mandal headquarters to lure innocent farmers. The outlets are designed in such a way that no farmer will suspect the trade is illegal. In fact, the vigilance and enforcement wing was surprised to see the new shops when they carried out raids on some other shops in Palnadu region. While the vigilance people conducted raids with a suspicion that merchants were selling unbranded fertilizers, they were stumped to find that these traders do not possess any kind of license.
 
 According to rules, the merchants involved in the sale of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides should secure license from the agriculture department, besides getting a no-objection certificate from local revenue, police, and fire departments depending on the location of the shops. The merchants should also take trade license from labour department before starting operations. They should also secure permission from the local body, either the panchayat or the municipality. 
 
 “It is really shocking that the traders involved in sale of bio-fertilizers and pesticides do not have any licenses,” said Sobha Manjari, regional vigilance and enforcement officer (RVEO).
 
 The   outlets are said to be rampant in Gurazala, Macherla, Vinukonda, Chilakaluripet, Sattenapalle, and Narasaraopet constituencies.
