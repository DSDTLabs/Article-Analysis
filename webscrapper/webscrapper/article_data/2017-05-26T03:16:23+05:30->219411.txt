Apart from this, four peacocks are undergoing treatment at   in Jacobpura, sources said.
 
 “Cases of heat stroke are reported every summer, but we are able to save the birds with emergency care available at some NGOs. However, this time electrocution owing to rainfall in May has led to more deaths. In the last 15-20 days, we have also provided treatment to peacocks that suffered severe heat stroke and diarrhoea,” said Dr. Rajkumar of Jain Bird Hospital, a charitable bird hospital in the city.
 
 Amit Chaudhery of PFA,  , said, “Peacocks can’t fly for more than 15-20 feet. They often perch on power cables and get electrocuted when those are wet. The forest department has failed in ensuring that power cables are covered to save these birds. The department doesn’t even have any plan to work on it.”
 
 Staff in the district forest department, however, claimed no death had been recorded by them yet. “So far, our officials have not got any information about the death of peacocks. Electrocution is definitely a major cause of   deaths in Gurgaon. However, this time there have only been a few reports of heat strokes from Jharsa and Manesar. We have sent them to different veterinary hospitals,” said a wildlife guard, requesting anonymity. 
 
 While no death was reported in 2014 and 2015, two peacocks reportedly died in June 2016 in the city owing to heat stroke. Despite making several calls and sending messages, Shyam Sunder, district forest officer, didn’t respond to TOI’s queries.
