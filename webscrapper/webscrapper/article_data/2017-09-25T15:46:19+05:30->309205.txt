  Mimi Chakraborty: Raj is back with all his grandeur for yet another relationship tale, which is his forte.A well-made family entertainer, BDMK is a must-watch this Puja. It is a feel-good film which will leave you with a happy feeling. While Ankush is at his best, Nusrat is looking ethereal! Kudos to Raj for making such a beautiful film!
 
 Yash Dasgupta: BDMK is synonymous with Durga Puja. It has the perfect Puja feel and all the elements of a hit. According to me, this is Nusrat's best film till date and Ankush's comic timing is enviable.Moreover, the film bears Raj's signature style. Go, watch it and fall in love all over again.
 
 Sohini Sarkar: Jomjomat Pujor chobi! It's a typical love story in the quintessential Raj Chakraborty style. Ankush-Nusrat's chemistry is electrifying and the songs are really nice. Rajda has used all the characters to perfection -be it Saurav (Das) or Rajdeep, who is Kaushikda's (Ganguly) assistant.
