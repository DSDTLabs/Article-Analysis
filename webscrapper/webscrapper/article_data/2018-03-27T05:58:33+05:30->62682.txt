I welcome the decision of holding practicals in the subject as it would ensure better results. The question paper was easy as well,” she said.

 Another student,   of the same school, said, “Two questions from macroeconomics were tough. The difficulty level of rest of the questions were average. The four and six-marks questions were the easiest ones among all. It was not at all lengthy. We were able to finish the paper before time and also got some time on hand to revise the answers.”
