Surat:   

 Two burglars targeted the ATM of Central Bank of India at Resham Bhavan in Mahidharpura area. One of them entered in kiosk at around 9.45 pm while the other was standing outside to keep an eye. The burglar first opened the lower body cover of the ATM using some key and then tried to break open the cash box. It was also attempted to slice open the gap from where the cash is dispensed. However, he could not do so. 
 
 After trying for few minutes, the burglars left the spot. They closed the opened cover before leaving. The ATM is placed inside the narrow space that is not easily visible from outside. If someone tries to tamper with the machine, it can be seen only if the miscreant enters the unit, the police said
 
 Movement of these two persons has been captured on the CCTV camera installed inside the ATM. “We have recovered the video grabs of the CCTV cameras and we are examining it. In the video, faces of the burglars are not clearly visible,” a Mahidharpura police official said.
 
 In another attempt reported at Union Bank of India’s ATM at Siddheshwari Society on Ved Road, burglars escaped with CCTV digital video recorder (DVR) worth Rs 3,000. The burglars made a failed bid to open the ATM. They later stole the DVR installed inside the unit. Hence, the police could not recover the CCTV footages. 
 
 In the theft attempt at Mahidharpura, the burglars could not steal the DVR since it was installed inside the bank branch adjoining the ATM. “We are now examining the CCTV footages of different roads connecting these two spots to establish the identity of the suspects and the vehicle used by them,” the police said.
