AHMEDABAD: With just a few days to go for   2017-18, stock markets players are worried that tweaking of long term   for listed equities will be a setback, although a temporary one.

 At present, if an investor is holding a stock for more than 12 months, it is considered to be a long-term investment. Any long-term gains from transaction in such stocks are exempt from taxes. Any gains from transactions in shares held for less than year attracts short-term capital gain tax at the rate of 15%.
 
 “The markets are worried that the holding period for availing capital gains tax exemption may be raised from the present one year to three years. If this happens, the markets could get a temporary setback, but the markets could gradually absorb it,” said  , head of business-private client group,  .
 
 “Markets could see strong selling pressure if this is done with a retrospective effect. However, investors should use such opportunity to buy the stocks for the long term. Even in the short term, say by Diwali, we see Nifty at a level of 9,000 mark,” he added.
 
 As the real estate market is down and banks have lowered interest rates on fixed deposits, a lot of money is expected to flow into equities. “The stock markets will genuinely offer positive returns, higher than the inflation rate,” Sharma added. According to him, in current market condition, equity investments with long term horizon of 5-7 years, will fetch 10-12% compounded annual growth during the period.
 
 “Since a lot of household savings have come into the banks, we expect sops for first-time investors in the current budget,” he added.
 
 As far as the impact of demonetization on corporate results in concerned, sectors like real estate, transport and logistics may be impacted adversely. “However, the markets may not fall on account of bad results or poor economic data as the worst is behind us,” he said.
