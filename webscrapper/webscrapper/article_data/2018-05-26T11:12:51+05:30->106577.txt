BENGALURU: All three public sector general insurers — Oriental Insurance,   Insurance and   — have been pulled up and told by finance ministry officials to boost their capital levels, ahead of their merger, said sources. All three have poor scorecards with United India’s solvency ratio at 1.54, Oriental at 1.67 and National Insurance at 1.26, according to public disclosures made by the companies.

 
 The solvency ratio represents the ratio of the company’s own capital to the risk that it is exposed to and is equivalent to the capital adequacy ratio for banks. While United India and Oriental have scraped through the regulator’s solvency ratio requirement of 1.50 — a measure of an insurer’s ability to meet claims — National Insurance has not met industry standards.
 
 This poor performance comes into sharp contrast when measured with New India Assurance’s 2.58 and private players ICICI Lombard General Insurance’s 2.05 and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance’s 2.76 as on March 31, 2018.
 
 Given the deadline of merging by April 2019 and then going public, it would be near impossible for the three to boost their capital levels organically, said an executive from a public sector insurer. The executive added, “Irdai officials made representations that the government would have to step in with fresh capital or allow insurers to raise funds from the market. Both suggestions were discussed, but nothing was finalised. But the companies and Irdai did make it clear that it would not be possible for them to cut expenses, trim their budget and meet capital requirements on their own within the next 11 months.”
