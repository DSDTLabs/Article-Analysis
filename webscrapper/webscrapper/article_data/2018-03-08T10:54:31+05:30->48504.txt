COIMBATORE: A 30-year-old pregnant   committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling of her room at her residence at   here on Wednesday evening. The woman, identified as R  , has left behind a suicide note, saying no one was responsible for her death. “She was four months pregnant,” police said.

 According an investigating official, Meenakshi got married to one Rajesh, who was her relative, some six years ago and they have a two-and-a-half-years old son.
 
 On Wednesday 8.30am, she reportedly called up her husband, who was at his workplace, and asked him to take their son along with him. “Since he was busy at work, he couldn’t come home and instead sent his mother, who was residing separately,” the official told TOI. 
 
 When the mother-in-law reached the house, she found the front door was locked from inside. Since there was no response from inside, she asked her son to come down and the duo broke open the door only to find Meenakshi hanging from the ceiling of her room. Her son was sleeping in another room, the official added. 
 
 Finding her struggling for life, the mother-son duo took her to the government hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. 
 
 Later, the police was alerted and they found a suicide note, in which Meenakshi has stated that no one was responsible for her death and asked her family to take care of her son. Postmortem was performed at the government hospital itself. 
 
 The revenue divisional officer has held an inquiry with her husband and his family, since the unnatural death took place within seven years of her marriage.
