CHENNAI: A 74-year-old social activist in R K Nagar who tried to stop a ruling party legislator from occupying a tract of land in R K Nagar worth about Rs1,000 crore, has been arrested on charges of keeping 2,100kg of ganja at his residence.

 Vedagan, a social activist, had been alleging that the MLA was trying to usurp the land identified by the government for allotment to homeless poor in the   constituency, which former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had represented till her death last December.
 
 The issue came to light after Vedagan, arrested on April 19, moved the special court for Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for bail. This was his third attempt to get bail. Though the special judge dismissed the bail application citing that the investigation was at an initial stage, he directed the commissioner of police to nominate an officer known for his integrity to inquire this case and submit a report to the court.
 
 According to his counsel, Vedagan is president of Ezhil Nagar Welfare Association. After the state government identified the land for the benefit of 4,000 residents, he moved the high court for proper allotment of residential plots to the target beneficiaries. Vedagan obtained a favourable court order, too, said his counsel. This angered the ruling party MLA and his associates, said Vedagan’s counsel. 
 
 Vedagan refused to part with the documents relating to the land. Despite the fact that he is 74 and has been residing in the area for more than 50 years, police registered a series of criminal cases including the one alleging that he had 2,100kg ganja, all at the instance of the ruling party legislator, Vedagan’s counsellor said.
 
 Vedagan managed to obtain bail in a couple of cases from the Madras high court, but because of rejection of bail plea in the ganja case, he has to remain in prison for many more days to come, his counsel said.
