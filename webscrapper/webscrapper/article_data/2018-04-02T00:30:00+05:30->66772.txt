Health at stake: Garbage dumping and burning continue unabated near the Bank of Baroda Layout 6& 7th Main, JP Nagar 7th Phase. Heaps of trash left unattended by BBMP dot the street. Plastic waste is often put on fire on the road side and residents are exposed to polluted air. BBMP must look into the issue.
