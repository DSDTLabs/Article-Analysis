Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar told the legislative assembly on Tuesday that the proposal for microfilming (reproducing a document on film), scanning and digitisation of archival records at the directorate of archives and archaeology is under way.  The directorate has begun scanning old land records, Parrikar said in a written response to a question tabled by Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes, during Question Hour. Fernandes had raised concerns that several important documents maintained by the directorate of archives were being affected by poor storage facilities, lack of space and changing weather conditions, and sought to know the steps taken to protect them.  In reply, the chief minister said records were being cleaned and fumigated. He also said that those that had turned brittle were regularly repaired and sprayed with chemicals. “All the records are then stacked and preserved in a scientific manner in dehumidified areas,” he added.
