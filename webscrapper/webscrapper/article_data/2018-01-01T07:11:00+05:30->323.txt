Jalandhar: Five dozen organizations have announced to launch public protests against the proposed enactment of Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act and Punjab Control of Organised Crime Act (PCOCA) saying that these would be used to supress public agitations on different issues of public interest.

 A convention organized by these organizations, largely leftist and ultra-leftist groups, announced that they would hold big rallies in Barnala and Jalandhar on February 16 and 17, respectively, to protest against the proposed laws.
 
 The speakers said that SAD-BJP government was also ready to promulgate both the laws but then avoided going ahead with these just before the assembly polls. But now, the Congress, which had opposed these laws before was going ahead with their execution. They said that though PCOCA was being brought against gangsters, the state government wanted to supress political opponents and dissenters.
