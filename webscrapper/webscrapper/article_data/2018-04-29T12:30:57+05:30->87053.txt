LUCKNOW: Around a dozen members of   staged a flash protest and pelted eggs and tomatoes at the 9-A Kalidas Marg official residence of state cabinet minister Om Prakash   on Saturday over his remark against Yadav community.

 Minister   Rajbhar had allegedly given a statement in Varanasi on Friday that members of Yadav community consume more alcohol than others and they are also in liquor business.
 
 The minister was not in the residence when the incident took place.
 
 His aides told reporters that Rajbhar had left to visit his constituency   in Ghazipur district.
 
 No official complaint has been lodged by the minister so far, said police.
 
 At around 12.45pm, a group of youths, including a girl, led by one Mulayam  , a PhD scholar in Shakuntala Devi National Rehabilitation University, assembled outside the minister’s house.
 
 They raised slogans demanding Rajbhar’s resignation for his alleged defamatory remark against Yadav community, broke his nameplate, pelted tomatoes and eggs at the gate, and fled. They also demanded apology from the minister. The drama lasted for a little over 15 minutes. The protesters had informed mediapersons in advance, hence their act was caught in camera.
 
 Police personnel deployed at the house remained mute spectators. Later, PAC guard Om Prakash informed   police and asked for extra security.
 
 He told TOI that while boys threw tomatoes and eggs, the girl clad in half-jacket dismantled the name plate outside the gate.
 
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, who led the protest, told TOI, “Yadavs have only been in the profession of selling of milk.”
 
 “We are yet to get any written complaint in this regard. However, a case will be filed, we are waiting for a call by senior officials,” said SHO Gautampalli, Suraj Kumar.
 
 In a tweet late Saturday night, SP national president Akhilesh Yadav wrote, “Log nasha karte hai, jaati nahi. (People consume drugs not communities.)”
