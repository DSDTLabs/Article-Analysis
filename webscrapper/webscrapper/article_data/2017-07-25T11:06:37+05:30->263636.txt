NAGPUR: The   (Kokate) Gram Panchayat on Monday unanimously passed a resolution against release of Brahmapuri’s problem tigress in   Tiger Reserve.

 The resolution says most of the villagers around Bor work as farm labourers, rear domestic animals and also do farming. On many occasions, villagers have sighted tigers even in the day time in the farms and also when they stayed there to protect crop from wild animals, says the resolution submitted to the Bor and New Bor range offices on Monday. 
 
 “Releasing the problem tigress of   will add to the woes of villagers. We will resort to chain-hunger strike if the tigress is released in Bor,” the resolution adds.
 
 A copy of the resolution has also been sent to the PCCF (wildlife) AK Misra. Sarpanch of Bori (Kokate) Roshan Maske said villages like Hingni, Adegaon, Garamsur, Amgaon, Salai Pevat and others in the periphery of the tiger reserve will also submit their resolutions to the forest department in a day or two.
 
 The PCCF (wildlife) considered 138.12 sq km Bor as the best place to release the tigress as Navargaon village has been relocated and at least 17 sq km area has become completely inviolate. There is good prey in the meadows that have come up on the agriculture fields. It is also better placed administratively.
 
 However, with Bor already overcrowded with tigers, local villagers have up the ante against releasing the tigress, which they say has killed two persons and injured five. These villagers were harmed after they came in critical distance of the wildcat while venturing deep into the forest.
 
 In the meanwhile, in a release issued on Monday, APCCF (wildife) N Rambabu has appealed to the people not to panic and said all precautions were being taken prior to the release of the tigress. In case of any fears, villagers have been told to contact forest staff. They have also been asked to contact forest department helpline number 1926.
