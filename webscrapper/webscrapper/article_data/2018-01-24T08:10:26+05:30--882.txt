NEW DELHI: The   will on Wednesday hear   petitions filed by 20 former AAP   challenging the Centre’s notification against their disqualification as legislators for holding office of profit.

 The plea will be heard by Justices S Ravindra Bhat and A K Chawla. Five of the ex-MLAs — including Kailash Gahlot who also holds the law portfolio in the government — argued that EC had acted in “undue haste”, and without “affording” and “giving any opportunity of fair hearing” to the petitioners. 
 
 “Respondent number 1 (EC) has acted contrary to the principles of natural justice by wilfully depriving the petitioners to submit oral submissions,” the   filed through counsel Manish Vashist argued.
 
 The ex-MLAs have argued that EC “failed to follow due process of law by not offering the petitioners a full hearing before making the final opinion to the President”. In addition, the former MLAs argued that EC did not consider that the “parliamentary secretary” was a “mere post” as opposed to an office. “The holders of the post are only carrying out an additional function to assist governance. They do not have any executive powers and, hence, are not responsible for decision-making, unlike ministers,” the ex-legislators claimed.
 
 HC had on Monday dismissed an application filed last week by the then MLAs challenging EC’s communication and given them the liberty to   a fresh plea. The legislators had filed the applications in the main pending petition, wherein they had challenged EC’s stand to examine a complaint against them for holding office of profit. The petition was filed in HC in August 2017 by the   after EC had commenced hearing on the petition moved by advocate Prashant Patel seeking their disqualification for holding the office of parliamentary secretaries, which he had said amounted to office of profit.
