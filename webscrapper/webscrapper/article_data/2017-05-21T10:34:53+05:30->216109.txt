How do you count elephants for a census in a dense forest where sighting them is difficult?

 By counting piles of their dung. That the   14 to 16 times a day makes the process that much easier.
 
 The ministry of environment and forests has begun Project   for the   census of 2016-17. The nation-wide census will determine elephant population and demographics across India. The training of field staff for the census has been completed in UP and other states.
 
 The census would be conducted using the direct and indirect method. The direct method will be used in areas where elephants are easily visible due to high population density. Field staff and census workers will click photographs and prepare a profile of the animals. The density is usually one elephant every 5sq km to 8sq km.
 
 The indirect count, meanwhile, would be more interesting. It will be used in areas where the density of elephant is low and sightings are less. Instead of counting elephants, it will be the piles of elephant dung which will be counted.The method is called 'dung decay' technique.
 
 On an average, an elephant defecates 14 to 16 times a day.“Given the standard, suppose we find 32   in a region in a day then we can say that there were two elephants there,“ says senior scientist at Indian Institute of Sci ence, Bangalore, Surendra Verma.
 
 Census workers will have to walk across the forests and count dung piles and collect samples. The samples will decide if there is one or more elephant which has defecated along the stretch.
 
 The dung decay method is to be used at 35 locations in the country including at  .
 
 “The dung decay rate would vary for all locations depending on temperature, landscape, rainfall and other factors. It will show how frequent and recent is the movement of elephants in the region,“ says the scientist.
 
 The dung decay technique has been used by elephant experts in the country and is said to have 90% to 100% precision.
