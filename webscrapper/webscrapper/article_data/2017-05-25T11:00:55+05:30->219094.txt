NEW DELHI: Direct-to-home operator DishTV on Thursday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 28.33 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, hit by revenue fall. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 482.77 crore in January-March a year ago,   said in a   filing.

 Total income from operations was down 12.44 per cent at Rs 718.98 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 821.15 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
 
 Dish TV's total expenses were at Rs 748.07 crore, up 0.91 per cent, as against Rs 741.28 crore of Q4 of FY 2015-16.
 
 "Subscription revenues during the quarter were lower by 11.1 per cent compared to the same quarter last year mainly due to the absence of a major cricketing event as well as package down gradation by existing subscribers," said Dish TV in a statement.
 
 Resultantly, average revenues per user (ARPU) declined as well.
 
 "Higher transponder cost, due to additional capacity acquired during the quarter, led to an increase in overall COGS. Mark-to-market losses, due to foreign exchange fluctuations, resulted in higher Other Expenses during the quarter," it added.
 
 For the entire 2016-17 fiscal, Dish TV's net profit stood at Rs 109.28 crore, down 84.21 per cent, from Rs 692.42 crore in the previous fiscal. Its revenue from operations for the fiscal stood at Rs 3,061.90 crore, down 1.98 per cent, compared to Rs 3,123.98 crore in the previous year.
