PUNE: After a 19-year-old college student refused to befriend an   man, he allegedly created a fake account in her name on a social networking site and shared obscene posts about her.

 The   police on Saturday registered an offence against the suspect and booked him under section 354 (A) (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Information and Technology (IT) Act.
 
 A Hadapsar police officer told TOI that the complainant and the suspect were studying in the same college in the city. “The suspect had proposed the woman for friendship a few months ago. However, she turned him down,” the officer said.
 
 Furious by the rejection, the suspect created a fake account in her name on a social media website in December last year. “He then started posting lewd material about the complainant on the web,” the officer said.
 
 The officer said the woman recently came to know about the fake account and obscene posts, following which she filed a police complaint.
