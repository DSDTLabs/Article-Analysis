Jaisalmer: Many war heroes who had fought the Indo-Pak War in 1971 at   are living a life of abject penury and yet to receive any financial assistance from government. Sipahi Richpal Singh of Sikar district, Havaldaar Bhanwar Singh and inspector Laxman Singh both from Nagaur, Lans Naik Bhairo Singh, who retired from 18 BN BSF haven’t received any assistance from either Central or state government. They were deployed in Jaisalmer’s Kishangarh sector and occupied Islamgarh, Bhaikhan, Sakirewala Khoo, Arjun Wala Toba, Fateh Khan Wala Toba of Pakistan and hoisted Indian flag in these areas.

 Lans Naik Bhairo Singh, resident of Shergarh, Jodhpur, had played an important role in the victory in Indo-Pak War in 1971. Today, he is leading an anonymous life. Suneil Shetty essayed his role in J P Dutta’s ‘Border’ movie based on the 1971 War. The movie showed that Bhairo Singh had become martyr, but in real life, the war hero had stopped the tank brigade of Pakistan and showed his bravery. He is living in penury and somehow manages two-course meal. His son is 12th pass and still unemployed.
 
 “We are forced to live in pain as there is no one to hear us,” he said.
 
 The Central government apart from giving Seva Medal has done nothing. The state government did not give any land for cultivation or job to his family members. His son is running from pillar to post for a government job.
 
 Even the movie maker did not give any help to Bhairo Singh. Today, he feels cheated.
 
 Singh said he had not seen ‘Border’ movie, but heard about it. He feels disappointed that the Central government had given him Seva Medal for bravery during 1971 War, but no other benefits of Seva Medal were given to him.
