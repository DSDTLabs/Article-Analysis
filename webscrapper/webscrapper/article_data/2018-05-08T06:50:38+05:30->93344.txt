PATNA: Three bike-borne criminals gunned down Sanskrit teacher Radhesh Ranjan (33) of Lakshmi Narayan High School at Bhagwanpur under Bafapur Banthu panchayat in   district on the school campus at around 9.30am on Monday. The locals, teachers and students blocked the road for more than two hours after the incident.

 Ranjan, a native of Bahlolpur village in   district, was going to the classroom when the criminals shot him thrice and escaped, Bhagwanpur police station SHO Ajay Kumar said. Ranjan was rushed to Hajipur sadar hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead. Police suspect personal enmity as the reason behind his murder as Ranjan was attacked by unidentified persons almost one and a half years ago outside the Government High School at Pauni Hasanpur village under the Vaishali police station area. 
 
 Ranjan had joined LN High School only eight months ago. “He had got himself transferred from the Pauni Hasanpur school after escaping a bid on his life. He had registered a complaint against two unidentified persons,” SHO Ajay said.
 
  said Ranjan had lodged an FIR on December 14, 2016 after criminals fired at him after the dispersal of school. “The police asked him many times whether he had doubts on anyone. But he never mentioned any name. Nobody was arrested in that case,” he said.
 
 “We have yet to record the statements of his family members. There was no CCTV camera inside or outside the school. However, police have recorded the statements of a few people who were present at the school,” Bhagwanpur SHO said.
