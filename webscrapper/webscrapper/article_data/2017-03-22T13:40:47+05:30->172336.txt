CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday declined to pass any order on a public interest litigation against the candidature of AIADMK general secretary   in the April 12 byelection to the RK Nagar constituency. The court asked the PIL-petitioner to approach the authorities concerned for remedy.

 The first bench of Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice RMT Teeka Raman, disposed of the PIL filed by PA Joseph of Arumbakkam without any specific directive to any authorities.
 
 In his PIL, Joseph said Dinakaran had been imposed a penalty of Rs 28 crore for   (Foreign Exchange Regulation Act) violations, and the punishment was upheld by the first bench of Madras high court too. He also served a whole term after being detained under COFEPOSA (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act), and his detention was upheld by the Supreme Court.
 
 In this regard, Joseph said adjudication proceedings under special laws such as the Customs Act, 1962 and FERA, 1973 are parallel to criminal proceedings and added that restricting disqualification from contesting in polls to only conviction in criminal proceedings and not for payment of penalty under special acts after adjudication proceedings was unfair.
 
 “The parliament has no power to restrict the disqualification only to criminal conviction when the very Act holds that both adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are parallel and the very act never differentiate both proceedings,” said Joseph. 
 
 He sought to declare sections 8(1)(c) and 8(1)(e) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 as illegal and unconstitutional since it restricted disqualification only to criminal conviction and not for punishment for adjudication proceedings under special Acts such as Customs Act, 1962 and FERA, 1973.
