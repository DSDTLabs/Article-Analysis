Ludhiana: A Class XII student was killed after a speeding truck ran over her two-wheeler near Sherpur on Tuesday morning.

 Gurleen Kaur, 17, a resident of Daba Road, New Shimlapuri, was going to her school when the accident took place around 7.15am. 
 
 Randhir Singh, Gurleen’s father, said in his police complaint, “My daughter was driving to her school, Darshan Academy on Chandigarh Road, when the rashly-driven truck hit her scooter. As she fell down, the truck ran over her. My injured daughter cried for help, but passers-by clicked her pictures instead of taking her to a hospital.” 
 
 Division 6 police station assistant sub-inspector Pooran Singh said, “The truck driver sped away after the crash. We are scrutinising the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area to arrest the accused. A case has been registered under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.”
