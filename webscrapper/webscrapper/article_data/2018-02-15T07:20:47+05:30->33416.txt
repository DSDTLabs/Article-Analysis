HYDERABAD: L&T Metro Rail (Hyderabad) Limited and Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited have crossed swords over naming   after private entities. Prakash Nagar (near Begumpet) station has been renamed 'Invesco Prakash Nagar' in honour of a corporate. Invesco is an Indian subsidiary of US-based investment management firm. Sources said L&T is also in talks with several other companies to name other stations like the one at Jubilee Hills.

 L&T has been striking deals with financial aspects to prefix the company’s names to the Metro stations. Opposing the move, HMRL Managing Director NVS Reddy told TOI, “We have not agreed to L&T’s proposal of attaching private company’s names to stations even though it’s a practice being followed in many cities.”
 
 When asked about the developer having already renamed the  ,   said,”This was done without our knowledge and approval.”
 
 
  
 The Metro rail has commenced its operations between Miyapur and Nagole stretch covering a distance of 30 km and 24 stations are in operation. Each of the stations is currently named after popular locations like Parade Ground, NGRI, Ameerpet, Begumpet, KPHB, Kukatpally, Miyapur and so on. An official of Municipal Administration Department told TOI, “L&T may be working on increasing revenues through various methods. However, prefixing or renaming stations with company names will add confusion to the general public. The way   Station had got prefix of Invesco has to be looked into.”
 
 Officials revealed that L&T HMRL might get a break even only in the sixth or seventh year from the day of operation due to cost escalation. The company has spent around ?13,200 crores on the project so far.
 
 Hyderabad Metro revenue model was built so that 50% of revenue comes from passenger fare, 45% from property development and 5% from advertisements.
