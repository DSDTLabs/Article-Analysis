THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   minister   has initiated action against authorities of a Bhadrakali temple in Vithura, Thiruvananthapuram, after their plans to conduct a   using human blood went viral on the social media. 

 Authorities of   said hundreds of devotees would attend the 'yagna' (fire ritual) from March 12-23 and 'donate' blood using disposable syringes. The ritual is believed to cure diseases and has been performed thrice in the past.
 
 Though the practice has been termed primitive, temple official A Manikantan said only a few drops of blood would be taken from each devotee with the help of a lab technician for the ritual. The blood will be sprinkled during the yagna, which will be conducted as per Vedic practices. "The ritual will give devotees a strong belief that their diseases have been cured. When people don't mind giving blood during hospital tests, why should donating a few drops for their belief affect them?" he added.
 
 Devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran, however, asked district collector and rural SP to act against the organizers. In his Facebook post, the minister said that such rituals are an insult to the state. "Human and animal sacrifices, which were abolished in the state following renaissance, are coming back. Such rituals must be opposed," Surendran wrote.
