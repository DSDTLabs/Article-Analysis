Krishnagiri: The Kumudepalli Lake, which three months ago depicted a poor picture with weeds obstructing water flow and surroundings filled with garbage and thick vegetation, is now flowing smoothly in a clean and green environment.

 The credit goes to Ashok Leyland, flagship of the Hinduja Group, which desilted the lake and cleaned its surroundings as part of its corporate social responsibility.
 
 The rejuvenated lake, spread across 4.5 hectares area with a storage capacity of 60 lakh kilolitres, was on Tuesday dedicated to the residents of Kumudepalli village at a function attended by Krishnagiri collector C Kathiravan, Hosur sub-collector J U Chandrakala and Ashok Leyland president (HR, communication and CSR) NV Balachandar.
 
 Ashok Leyland had taken up the rejuvenation of the lake in December 2017. “Within three months, the lake and its surrounding areas have been transformed and it will be an integral part of the local community and ecosystem,” Balachandar said.
 
 The lake stores water from PWD irrigation canal, besides rainwater. “We have constructed a crossover bridge and its side has been paved with stones. A new 400 metre pathway is in place for the school children,” Balachandar said.
 
 Ashok Leyland employees and other dignitaries participated in the function.
