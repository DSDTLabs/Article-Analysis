BENGALURU: The   on Tuesday expelled its former block functionary and BWSSB member K   for six years after a video in which he was seen sprinkling petrol inside a BBMP office went viral.

 In the February 16 video, Narayanaswamy is seen threatening to burn down the BBMP office even as Chengal Rayappa, the assistant revenue officer of Horamavu, pleads with him to calm down. Narayanaswamy was allegedly pressuring Rayappa to make khata (document for property) for a private layout, sources said. While Rayappa said he couldn’t do so as the matter was in court, Narayanaswamy allegedly insisted that he make the khata illegally. Days later, Rayappa was transferred.
 
 Soon after the video went viral on social media and television channels, the ruling Congress got into damage control mode. In the assembly, during the discussion on law and order in the city, home minister Ramalinga Reddy said he had asked the police to file a suo motu case against Narayanswamy for his attempt to burn down the BBMP office.
 
 Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) president   announced that Narayanaswamy had been expelled from party membership for six years.
 
 Earlier in the day, Narayanaswamy told mediapersons that he was forced to visit the BBMP office after he received complaints from people. “I didn’t go there for personal work. I went there to get justice for public. There were a lot of complaints against the officer on delaying issue of khata. I am not denying what has happened but one should look at the causes that prompted it,” he said. Narayanaswamy has been absconding since.
