Ghaziabad: A day after TOI reported about the mess in   2 in   as water from the drains was overflowing on the road since Sunday, the   swung into action and cleaned the area on Monday.

 A super sucker machine, a jetting machine and two dumping trucks were deployed to clean the road of overflowing drain water. The task was overseen by a GDA team. On Monday, members of the  , an association of women residents of a dozen housing societies in the area, also barricaded footpaths alongside the road with barbed wires in order to prohibit hawkers and vendors from squatting.
 
 “The dumping trucks will collect the overflowing water and dispose it elsewhere. A team of officials has been deputed to the spot. They have been asked to conduct the cleaning operation smoothly,” executive engineer, GDA, Chakresh Jain, told TOI.
 
 On Sunday, residents of several housing societies had complained to the GDA after water from clogged drains began overflowing onto the Mall Road. The GDA had, however, told residents that a plan to undertake cleaning of drains in the area has been hanging balance owing to the imposition of the model code of conduct for the assembly polls.
 
 Residents have alleged that the drains are being clogged owing to improper disposal of waste materials and garbage into it by hawkers and vendors squatting over slabs covering the drains.
 
 “We have placed heavy flower pots on the slabs covering the drains after barricading them with barbed wires. This will prevent slabs from getting stolen. In the past, several slabs have been stolen. Garbage is being dumped into drains through these holes,” said Sunita Khokhar, a resident of SPS Heights and also a member of the Green Team.
