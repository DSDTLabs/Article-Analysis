 The TV star recently launched the promo of his new show where he was seen making fun of his downfall and dull period. The promo was much appreciated by his fans. Kapil hogged the limelight last year, for all the wrong reasons. Be it his much talked about mid-air brawl with former co-star   or his alleged addiction to alcohol, Kapil constantly made headlines.
 
 Post Kapil's spat with Sunil early last year, several actors who were a part of The Kapil Sharma Show quit. Ultimately this began to affect the TRP's and also took a toll on the comedian's health. In a span of six-months, considering all the circumstances, the channel on which the show was aired decided to give Kapil a short break to recover himself.
 
 Recently, while talking to a new agency, Kapil had stated, that his fellow star Sunil Grover got angry after seeing himself in news after their fight. He said, "I think Sunil got more angry after seeing himself in news. Because he was not so angry (when the incident happened). I have said enough from my side, and now I don't feel like talking about it. It happens between friends but can't hold a grudge forever. Then I will also start feeling that 'mein galat nahi hun' (I am not wrong)."
