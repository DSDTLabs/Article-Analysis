 The NCP announced this after a meeting late on Monday. Sources said the party may scale down its demand to 106 to make the things work with the Congress. A decision about the final seat-sharing is expected before this weekend.
 
 “After discussions with our party workers we have sought 116 seats, but we will not be adamant and there will be scope for communication and negotiations. The party can think about sacrificing around 8 to 10 seats to satisfy the alliance partner,” NCP sources said.
 
 NCP’s city unit chief   said the party had worked out the percentage of votes garnered and number of elected members. “We are trying to be fair in a coalition. The aim is to unite people from the same school of thoughts,” she said. 
 
 The first round of talks between both parties were scheduled late on Tuesday. Both parties will also factor in that three NCP corporators and six from the Congress have switched loyalties to other parties.
 
 Both have let local leaders decide about the alliance. On Monday, state unit chief of Congress Ashok Chavan said in Mumbai that they cannot join hands with NCP in Mumbai as the party had already declared their candidates. 
 
 “Local leaders did not want to join hands with the NCP in Mumbai. If the leaders in other cities want a coalition and send their proposals, they will be considered,” Chavan added.
 
 Former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar also said local leaders are aware of the ground situation. “They will be able to judge local conditions better. So we have given them the powers to take a call on alliances,” he had said during a recent party convention.
