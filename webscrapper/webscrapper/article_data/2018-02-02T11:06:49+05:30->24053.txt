 "Achhe din aa gaye kya? (Have the good days come?" Lalu said mockingly to the media persons gathered. 
 
 "Prime Minister   had promised to waive off loans of farmers. Has he done so?" Lalu also asked the reporters. He added that   has failed to fulfil the promises made to the farmers before becoming the prime minister.
 
 Lalu said that the PM had also promised employment for all, but a large number of youths are being retrenched from jobs. 
 
 "The government had promised 'achhe din' (good days) to the people but it has not yet delivered its promises. It is still a mirage for the people," Lalu said.
 
 During the court proceeding,   managed to produce two prosecution witnesses and record their testimonies in court.

 Mishra said there was no plan by the government for free distribution of animal fodder in that period.
