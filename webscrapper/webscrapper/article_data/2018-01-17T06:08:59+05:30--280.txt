BENGALURU: In an action-packed sequence, a chain-snatcher trying to escape the clutches of law climbed the roof of a house, only to crash-land in the kitchen and fall into police net eventually.

 On Tuesday morning, teams from HSR Layout police from southeast Bengaluru were busy keeping an eye on every nook and cranny of their jurisdiction, following stern directions from the city police commissioner to go for early-morning patrolling in residential areas to curb incidents of chain-snatching.
 
 Around 5.30am, an alert from the control room said a white Maruti Omni was spotted in HSR Layout and that it could be the same vehicle which was used to rob a woman of her gold chain on the morning of January 14.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police M B   immediately alerted police officials, who were patrolling near Mangammanapalya. A Cheetah motorbike and a Hoysala vehicle were rushed to Mangammanapalya.
 
 The Cheetah-borne constables were the first to reach the Maruti van. Constables   and   from HSR Layout police station noticed the van moving at a snail’s pace. The constables then approached the driver and asked him who he was and what he was doing there.
 
 "The driver’s reaction was unbelievable. He instantly hit the accelerator and sped. We chased him for nearly two kilometres, after which he entered a road that led to a dead-end," police officials, who were part of the team, said.
 
 On reaching the dead-end, the suspect stopped the vehicle, jumped out of it and climbed the roof of a house. "He, however, ran out of luck as the asbestos sheet broke and he fell directly in the kitchen of the two-bedroom house, which was occupied by a family," police said.
 
 The accused is   alias Somashekar, who’s in his late 30s and from  . "The accused had robbed a woman of her gold chain on the morning of January 14. We had identified the vehicle by then. To our luck, he returned in the same vehicle today," police said.
