AHMEDABAD: When it comes to funding   or taking up an exclusive project for the big cat species, the   has always citied the reason that the species is found only in one  . Even the state’s proposed Rs 274-crore Long Term Conservation Of Lions Project (LTLCP) has been denied funding by the Centre.

 Interestingly, even with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, allocation of   in 2016-17 was just Rs 95,000 per lion but was Rs 9 lakh per tiger. 
 
 A senior officer, who asked not to be named, said that the state government admitted in the assembly that for two years — from January 2015 to December 2016 — the central government did not provide additional   for   lion projects in Gujarat. There are 523 lions in Gujarat, according to the May 2015 lion census.
 
 “When it comes to grants, the Centre has neglected lions. Not just the Centre, the state government has also ignored funding of lion conservation. If the centre allocates less than Rs 5 crore for lion projects, the Gujarat government in its 2018-19 budget said that provisions for a mere Rs 4 crore were made for ‘Project Lion’, a conservation and development project for greater Gir.
 
 “The Rs 4 crore equals just 22% of the Rs 18-crore provision for plantation drives on private agricultural land to improve the economic status of farmers. There is a lack of political will for conservation of wildlife in the state.”
 
 According to officials, the Centre’s share in lion conservation funding was just 2.57% of what the Union government spends on Project Tiger. Gujarat is the only state where lions have survived. In the last five years, the Centre allocated just Rs 25.87 crore for lion conservation against the Rs 1,007 crore that Project Tiger got.
 
 Officials sources said that in 2016-17, allocation for funds for Project Tiger doubled. From Rs 155 crore in 2015-16, allocation in 2016-17 rose to Rs 342 crore. An official said that Gujarat has been getting funds for lion conservation based on project proposals it submits, but for the tiger, a specific amount of funds are allotted in the budget.
 
 The state government told the assembly has that in 2016-17 Gujarat allocated Rs 21.88 crore from its own coffers while in 2015-16 it had allocated just Rs 14.29 crore.
 
 The Rs 234 crore Long Term Lion Conservation Project was turned down by the Centre. The projects did not find a place in the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme, which is centrally-funded.
 
 A senior officer said that the UPA government had also turned down the state government’s Rs 234-crore proposal for the LTLCP. The Centre had then claimed that Rs 234 crore could not be allocated to a single species. After the Gujarat government sent a revised proposal for Rs 150 crore.
 
 Senior officials said that in 2014, the Gujarat government submitted the project proposal with an estimated cost of Rs150 crore for financial assistance under the IDWH. Gujarat had sought Rs 135 crore from the Centre while the state was to pay the remaining Rs 15 crore. However, in 2016, the Centre sent intimation of funds under IDWH being denied.
 
 Replying to a question MP Darshana Jardosh in the Lok Sabha, Rao Inderjit Singh, the Union minister of state for planning, said, “Required funds could not be released by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change in view of limited funds available.”
