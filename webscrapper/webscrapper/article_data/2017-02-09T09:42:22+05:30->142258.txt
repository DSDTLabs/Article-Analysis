NASHIK: The Infant Jesus Shrine on Nashik road is gearing up for the annual celebration of the feast of the infant Jesus scheduled on Saturday and Sunday.

 “The feast draws lakhs of pilgrims from all over the country and abroad each year. This year’s feast will be themed on the  ,” Father  , the church chaplain, said. 
 
 Preparations for the feast are in the final stage. A grand ‘pandal’ has already been set up to welcome around a lakh devotees. The installation of the stage behind St Xavier’s School in front of Father Sidney Fuse Hall is also complete.
 
 While the main feast will be celebrated on February 11, the   prayer to the infant Jesus has already started from February 2. This year, different themes were decided for each day of the prayer. For the convenience of the locals, the prayers are being held in English and Marathi.
 
 “Traditionally, the prayer is offered in English and Marathi as most visitors are from the Marathi belt. We also offer the same prayer in Tamil on the feast day,” Father Miranda said.
 
 The feast is also known for its grand fair organised on the occasion. The church administration has made arrangements to avoid traffic pile ups and manage the crowd.
 
 “The number of visitors will increase day to day and we expect a huge turnout this year. The stalls mostly have goods brought from Mumbai markets. Remarkably, Novena booklets, pictures, medals in this   are sent to different parts of the world during the feast. Special outlets have been opened for the sale of these goods in the shrine premises,” Father Miranda said. 
 
 The petition counter in the Shrine is the most vibrant location during the feast period. Thousands of devotees fill the petition slips and drop them in the box. All petitions are placed on the altar during the Novena Mass on Thursday. 
 
 The pilgrim house of the shrine remains closed during the annual feast as the entire rest house will accommodate volunteers who assist the shrine during the annual feast.
