Chandigarh: Within hours of getting bail in the Manesar land scam case, former chief minister Hooda attacked the BJP government over illegal mining and poor condition of farmers.

 “Despite the remarks made by the Supreme Court, the Haryana government has not been able to stop illegal mining. As far as agriculture is concerned, farmers are forced to commit suicide or throw their produce in the market due to poor state policies,” said Hooda.
 
 Talking about the land scam case, in which he is key accused, he said “We have full faith in the institution of judiciary. We will come out clean. This case is purely an act of vendetta by certain people who are trying to cover up their failures.”
 
 Deepender Hooda, who had accompanied his father to the courts complex, accused the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government of showing disrespect to farmers, soldier and sportspersons.
 
 “Showing disrespect to players, especially those who have earned you laurels in the international level, is the worst thing one could expect from the government. At a time when the entire country has adopted our sports policy, this government has started troubling players. This was for the first time when players have revolted against the government,” he said.
