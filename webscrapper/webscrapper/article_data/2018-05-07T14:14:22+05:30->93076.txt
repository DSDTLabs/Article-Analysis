GUWAHATI: Setting aside the suspension order of one Bina Babu  , an assistant planning officer (APO) who was arrested on charges of graft in 2016, the Gauhati high court has asked the state government to reinstate him. 

 No chargesheet was filed in the case even after the official's arrest over a year ago. The departmental enquiry into the case has also not been concluded yet either.
 
 On August 12, 2016, the anti-corruption branch of police, in pursuance of an FIR, arrested Singha on charges of abusing his position as a public servant to obtain pecuniary advantages and practising corruption. Following his arrest, Singha was under judicial custody till being released on bail later.
 
 Advocate Bishwajyoti  , the counsel of the petitioner  , said, "Due to being arrested and being detained in custody for more than 36 hours, he was placed under suspension from service. But even after more than one year, police have not filed chargesheet in the case, and neither has the departmental probe concluded."
 
 He added that a committee was formed in December 2017 to review the suspension order of the petitioner and as per the recommendation of the committee, the period of suspension order was extended by three months.
 
 "The suspension order has expired in March this year and no extension of the period of suspension was ordered thereafter. Since the period of suspension order has not been extended, Singha's suspension cannot be sustained any longer in view of the law settled by the  . Therefore, the suspension order has been quashed and set aside and the respondents have been directed to re-instate the petitioner to his post," Purkayastha added.
 
 However, in its order, the high court has directed the state government to transfer the official from his old office if the authorities feel that the presence of the petitioner in the same office as before may vitiate the investigation and the ongoing departmental enquiry till the probes are completed.
