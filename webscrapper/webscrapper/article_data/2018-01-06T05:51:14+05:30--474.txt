NAINITAL: In possibly the first instance of a court suggesting framing of a law which can act as a strong deterrent for child rapists, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday, expressing concern at the increasing number of instances of rape of minor girls, recommended to the state government to "enact suitable legislation within three months for awarding death sentence to all those found guilty of raping girls aged 15 years or below." 

  The division bench of justices Rajiv Sharma and   made the suggestion to the state government while hearing the appeal of a man, Karandeep Sharma, who was convicted of the rape and murder of an 8-year-old and was awarded the death penalty. The court dismissed his plea and upheld the death sentence awarded to him by the lower court. 
 
  Sharma had raped the child and murdered her in Rudrapur in   district in June 2016. The trial took place in a POCSO court which announced its judgement in April last year. 
 
 Stressing on the strong need for a legislation "which can act as deterrence in such heinous cases," the HC also cited data from a report of the   ( ) to point out the alarming increase in crimes against children in the hill state. 
 
 "According to the report of National Crime Records Bureau under the caption 'Crime Against Children (States & UTs)', 489 cases were registered in the year 2014, 635 cases were registered in the year 2015, and 676 cases were registered in the year 2016 (in the state)," the judges remarked, adding that "the ratio of cases registered under Sections 4 and 6 of POCSO Act/ Section 376 IPC is disproportionately large vis-a-vis the population of Uttarakhand." 
 
 Incidentally, almost a month ago, the   had passed a bill awarding death sentence to those found guilty of raping girls aged 12 years and below, thereby becoming the first state in the country to take such an initiative. 
 
 Explaining the need for such a legislation, MP chief minister   had said, "There are people in society who can be set right only by severe punishments."
