KANNUR:  , a dalit woman autorickshaw driver from   in the district, who had to leave her home following the frequent attacks allegedly by the CPM and the CITU workers, is at the receiving end again. The LDF government has decided to take back the land allotted to her by the previous UDF government, saying that she has another piece of land in her name.

 The decision comes while the construction of the house is fast progressing on the land. “It was the CPM which made hell out of my life and now they are snatching away the land the   sanctioned to me at Kattampally after I had threat to life in my native place. I will fight the case legally with the support of all the political parties who know what my plight is,” said Chithralekha, adding that her freedom to live and work was being questioned now.
 
 
 She said the six cents in her name at Edat actually belonged to her grandmother Narayani who gave it in her name to pledge it to buy an autorickshaw in 2004.
 
 “The party workers burnt that three-wheeler in 2005, destroyed the second one I bought and also made me flee the place just because I had an autorickshaw, which they consider a male domain, and also humiliated me as I am a dalit,” she added.
 
 MLA KM Shaji, who has taken the initiative to build the house by getting funds from various sources, said he would complete the work at any cost. “The government decision citing ridiculous reasons cannot be justified and we will fight the issue legally, politically and also with mass support, and will make sure that she is not evicted from the land,” Shaji said. DCC president   also urged the government to withdraw the decision.
 
 The government decision came after British art dealer and script   visited her last month, to make a film on her struggles.
