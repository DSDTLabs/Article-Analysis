GURUGRAM: A sudden rise in the number of   cases, especially among children, over the past one week has set the alarm bells ringing in the city. 

 More than 300 cases have been reported at   in Civil Lines alone in the past one week. Private hospitals are also receiving a large number of patients complaining about stomach ache and loose motion.
 
 “At least 40 to 50 children with symptoms of diarrhoea are coming to the paediatric   every day. In addition, several are reporting to the hospital emergency, out of which four-five kids are being admitted to the hospital on a daily basis,” a paediatrician at the General Hospital said. 
 
 At least 15-20 patients are visiting the general OPD every day for treatment for stomach ailments, said a paramedic at the hospital. 
 
 Doctors claimed the excessive   was the main reason. The mercury level is shooting up and residents are not prepared to deal with the climatic excesses. Stale and unhygienic food is another major cause of bacterial infection in stomach.
 
 Dr  , principal medical officer at the civil hospital, said: “We are witnessing a spike in diarrhoea cases, mainly among children. We have made preparations to handle these cases. Not only diarrhoea, we are equipped to deal with all seasonal diseases.”
