PUNE: A group of researchers at the   ( ) has launched a novel programme to prevent sexual violence against children.

 Called Program for Primary Prevention of Sexual Violence, the project offers free-of-cost “treatment” to people with paedophilia — individuals with a sexual interest in children and/or young adolescents or those who wish to consume child pornography — but who have not acted upon their impulses.
 
 “The very thought of paedophilia as a sexual orientation is hard to accept, especially in the Indian society. Therefore, we are spreading awareness about paedophilia so that, with treatment, future sexual violence against children can be prevented,” said Dr  , the director of  .
 
 There is also a website — troubled-desire.com — for self-diagnosis. “A series of questions are asked for the diagnosis. The patient can then choose to visit the centre or get counselling from experts on the site. It is all confidential. The IP address is not tracked, nor are any personal information, which can lead to identification, revealed,” said Prashant Kulkarni, an anthropologist and programme officer.
 
 “We first screen these people. Once we have established that they are paedophiles, we start the treatment. It involves psychotherapy and sexological treatments. But if that is not enough, medicines can be prescribed, which may even be lifelong,” said Dr  , who is a principal investigator and heads the psychiatry unit of the hospital.
