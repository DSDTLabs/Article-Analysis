Morgan Freeman's lawyer has demanded an immediate retraction and an apology from a news channel for a report in which multiple women accused the veteran actor of   and inappropriate behaviour.

 In a letter sent to the media house, Freeman's lawyer   said the report was a product of a "year-long witch hunt" against the 80-year-old that has caused damage to his reputation and career. 
 
  
  
 "At a minimum, a news channel immediately needs to issue a retraction and apologize to Mr. Freeman through the same channels, and with the same level of attention, that it used to unjustly attack him on May 24," read the 10-page letter. The letter also claims that one of the women named in the report, Freeman's Revelations Entertainment co-founder  , has rebutted the story. 
 
 "A news channel also needs to retract the portions of the story that concern Lori McCreary and apologize to her for defaming and injuring her," it added. It also claimed that a news channel reporter Chloe Melas, one of the co-authors of the report, misinterpreted Freeman's remarks to her during a press junket for his film  . 
 
 The letter stated that Melas "baited and prodded supposed 'witnesses' to say bad things about Mr. Freeman and tried to get them to confirm her bias against him". The media house, however, shot back at Freeman and in a statement said that it stands by its report. 
 
 "The unfounded accusations made by Mr. Freeman's lawyer are disappointing and are difficult to reconcile with Mr. Freeman's own public statements in the aftermath of the story," a news channel said. 
 
 "A news channel stands by its reporting and will respond forcefully to any attempt by Mr. Freeman or his representatives to intimidate us from covering this important public issue," it added.
