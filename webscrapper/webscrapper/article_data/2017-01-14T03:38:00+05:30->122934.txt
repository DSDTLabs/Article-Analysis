Panaji: Former   from Tivim and Sakhali constituencies on Friday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in presence of   state president Vinay Tendulkar, Tivim MLA Kiran Kandolkar and Sakhali MLA Pramod Sawant.

 Former Pale MLA Chandrakant Verekar’s son, Vijaykumar, along with his supporters, joined the BJP at a function held at the BJP headquarters in Panaji. 
 
 Around 20 Congress workers from Tivim joined the party. Dyneshwar Kambli from Tivim said that they have decided to join the BJP as Congress didn’t take them into confidence before former tourism minister Nilkant Halarnkar was accepted into the party.
 
 Kandolkar said he will make sure that, during next month’s elections, Congress doesn’t win a single seat. tnn
