Thane: A female   rescued from Kasarwadavli village on Sunday and treated at Thane SPCA was shifted to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park ( ) on Tuesday night. 

 The young   that was chased by a pack of dogs was brought to the SPCA for bite injuries, but on closer examination, was found weak, down with fever and covered with ticks. 
 
 Pawan Sharma, a wildlife warden associated with the Thane forest department, said, “By the time the SPCA ambulance reached   village, locals had managed to drive the dogs away and restrict the jackal to an isolated place. The volunteers immediately took the severely injured animal to its veterinary hospital where it received basic medication after which it was taken to a Mumbai-based vet for further treatment.”
 
 Dr Deepa Katyal, the Mumbai-based vet, said that the canine was almost dead when she was brought to her on Tuesday morning. “She was dehydrated and weak, her blood pressure was low, fever was high and she was barely moving. Using a catheter, I gave her a bottle of warm saline and some multi-vitamins which stabilized her to an extent. I also gave her some tick medications as her ears and skin were covered with ticks. As there was significant discharge from her nose and eyes, I informed the volunteers that she could either be suffering from one of the varieties of tick fever or even canine distemper,” said Dr Katyal.
 
 Veterinarians claimed that she is most likely suffering from viral, contagious and incurable canine distemper.
