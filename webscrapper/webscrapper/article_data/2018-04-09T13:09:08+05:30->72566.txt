PATNA: LJP chief and Union minister   on Sunday reiterated that there should not be any amendment in Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 as it would lead to increased atrocities on dalits.

 Talking to media persons here after chairing a review meeting on the upcoming Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations to be organised by his party on April 14,   said the SC/ST Act was the biggest tool with dalits and any changes in it would render it “toothless”. 
 
 “The rights given to dalits in the country will remain unchanged. No force can change SC/ST Act as it would lead to their harassment,” Paswan said.
 
 He added the LJP was the first party to go file a review petition in the   after its verdict on the SC/ST Act. “It was on the request of LJP and other SC and ST leaders in NDA that the Centre also filed a review petition, on which a decision is yet to be taken by the apex court. The government will chalk out future course of action only after the apex court gives its verdict,” Paswan added.
 
 He said the protests by dalit youths across the country against the last order of the court were genuine, but the opposition parties caused vandalism in the cover of demonstrations.
 
 Paswan also held detailed deliberation with party functionaries on the preparations for the upcoming Ambedkar Jayanti celebrations, which will coincide with the national convention of Dalit Sena, the backbone of LJP. CM   and his deputy   are also slated to attend the meeting, which is seen as NDA’s attempt to counter the opposition’s campaign to mobilise dalits against NDA.
 
 Paswan also met CM Nitish at his 1, Aney Marg residence on Sunday evening. Sources said Nitish is likely to announce inclusion of Paswans in the Mahadalit category, which is a long pending demand of LJP.
