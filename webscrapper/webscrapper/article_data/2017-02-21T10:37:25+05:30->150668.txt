 Many have taken the unusually warm spell in February for early arrival of summers. Experts, however, advised people not to pack their woollens for the time being because maximum and minimum temperatures will drop to 28-29 and 11-12 degrees Celsius by Wednesday and Thursday. 
 
 State Met director J P Gupta said temperatures increased because western disturbance (WD) hovering over hills has cut off the cold winds coming towards UP. The WD may cause light rains or thundershowers at isolated places in the Northwest UP on Tuesday. But in the rest of the state, including Lucknow, sky would be mainly clear.
