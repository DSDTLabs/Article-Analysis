GURGAON:   continued to harass residents across the city, even as the mercury climbed up. This, despite claims by officials they have resolved the   in the   feeding New Gurgaon.

 Many residential areas,  ,  ,  ,  , Ardee City and sectors 4, 10 and 45, witnessed intermittent power cuts. In some places, outages lasted up to 10-14 hours. Private areas, where supply infrastructure is incapable of handling peak load, were worst hit. “The transformer in our area was burnt by excess load. There was no power for almost 14 hours in lane D,” said Ardee City resident Nihal Mandhotra.
 
 Other Ardee City areas too have been facing 2-5 hour cuts daily. Similar conditions prevail in Block U, DLF 3 where 8-10 hour cuts are common.
 
 Sushant Lok 1 residents too complained of outages, but their bigger worry was voltage fluctuation that damaged electrical goods in many homes.
 
 Those living on the other side of the highway are not safe from severe power cuts either. 
 
 Sector 10A residents, for instance, complained of a 9-hour power cut on Wednesday night. Reports of cuts poured in from Sector 21 as well.
 
 Power disruption continued two days after a technical snag hit transformers at the PGCIL sub-station in Sector 72. Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN) superintendent engineer Anil Yadav dismissed DHBVN officials’ accusation that they were to blame. “Our supply was continuous, except at 7am, when the Delhi-Mehrauli line snapped,” he said, adding it was restored by 11am.
