Chennai: When Pradeepkumar received a book of Thiruppugazh poems by Arunagirinathar, he saw in the preface that it had taken V T Subramania Pillai 15 years to get it published. That started the classical musician’s fascination for the literary work — a 15th century collection of Tamil religious songs dedicated to Lord Murugan — and led him on a four-year journey, culminating in the  , Arunagiri Perumale.

 “I wanted to take up some Tamil literature and dwell deep in it,” he says. “When this book came my way, I knew this would be it.”
 
 The documentary was screened by the  , in partnership with the CP Ramaswami Aiyar Foundation, after a musical performance by Pradeepkumar and band mate Susha on Monday.
 
 The documentary is a passion project in which Pradeepkumar traces Arunagirinathar’s footsteps as he sets out to discover and document the saint-poet’s journey in places where legend holds he composed the Thiruppugazh.
 
 Pradeepkumar was chosen for the Fusion Arts US Exchange Program in 2008, which, he says, opened to him a world of cultures and musical traditions from around the globe. The documentary itself features a live music concert in which Pradeepkumar, Susha, Sean Roldon and a 16-piece   from Boston, Massachusetts, performs the poems of Thiruppugazh. These run alongside the narrative and along with a series of lively illustrations that Susha created.
 
 “What I’d collected were just stories and had to be shown in some way,” he says. “I wanted it to look like turning the pages of a comic — that’s why the illustrations. This is also my own journey. I have looked at Arunagirinathar’s life through the lens of his own work.”
