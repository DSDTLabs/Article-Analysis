The constituencies of St Andre, Cortalim and Velim got a maximum of 12 nominations each, but many contestants are expected to retreat tomorrow. Of the total 405 nominations received, 133 were rejected on scrutiny, an election officer said.

 Sanvordem candidate Uday Gaunker will have to contest the election as an independent and not on Aam Aadmi Party ticket due to a mistake in the filling of his nomination form, ruled the returning officer of Sanvordem.
