NAGPUR: Additional director general of police (law and order) SP Yadav, who headed the force in the city earlier, appeared before the special court for Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act ( ) on Saturday in the sensational gang-rape of a woman by gangster   and his accomplices in 2014. Apart from Yadav, former additional CP Deepak Pandey also deposed before the court to grant approval for investigation. 

 MCOCA was slapped on Afroze and his accomplices Akash Motghare, Pundlik Bhoyar and Anil Ingle on the charge of gang-raping and kidnapping a woman teacher at a desolate place along the   in Kalamna area in December 2014. The gang had also robbed the woman and her boyfriend. Following a complaint by the womanâ€™s boyfriend, cops had registered an offence at Kalamna police station. There was a similar offence registered against the gang at Hudkeshwar police station. 
 
 The then additional CP Pandey had granted approval to invoke MCOCA under section 23 (1) (A) of the stringent Act. A charge sheet was filed in 2015 for prosecution under section 23 (2) after sanction from Yadav. 
 
 Special public prosecutor Vijay Kohle said that senior police officers effectively put forth their views on slapping MCOCA considering the serious nature of the case. The defence counsels tried to corner officers during cross-examination, but they had studied and prepared the case well while deposing. Since the two officials ensured that the evidence in the case was not tampered with, the prosecution had a smooth sailing during cross-examination, Kohle said.
 
 With key depositions by the rape survivor and her friend supporting investigation details, the prosecution is hopeful that justice would prevail when the final judgment is expected to be announced later this month.
 
 The court had earlier witnessed a lot of drama in the case as accused Afroze targeted the special judge by verbally insulting him. His outbursts were incorporated in the record too.
