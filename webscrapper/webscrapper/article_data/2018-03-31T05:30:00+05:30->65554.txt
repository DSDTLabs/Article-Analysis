Mysuru: Unable to handle rejection from a girl he was besotted with, a 30-year old man scaled a high-tension electric transmission tower near Ramakrishna Circle in Ramakrishnanagar and threatened to commit suicide.

 Shankar, a resident of Yadahalli and a worker at a marble shop in Dattagalli, is said to be in love with a woman. He is said to have informed her about committing suicide and then scaled the tall transmission tower at 12.30pm to jump from it and end his life.
 
 Kuvempunagar police rushed to the spot along with fire department personnel and tried to bring him down safely. But Shankar did not relent to their pleas. The personnel then called his mother. The high drama ended after 54 minutes when Shankarâ€™s mother reached the spot and cajoled him to climb down.
 
 Police then warned him before letting him off.
