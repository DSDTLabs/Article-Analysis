PANAJI: Continuing to crack down on   unlawfully occupying space within the   municipal market, Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has issued final   to 103 vendors asking them to vacate the premises immediately, commissioner Dipak Dessai said.   is expected to take possession of the illegally-occupied stalls as soon as the code of conduct is lifted by the election commission.

 Cracking the whip on vendors, who have illegally bought space or squatted on the municipal market premises, Dessai issued final eviction orders based on an order issued by the high court of Bombay at Goa. In October 2016, CCP had issued eviction orders to vendors and simultaneously issued show-cause notices to 152 vendors, asking why action should not be taken against them.
 
 “Final eviction orders have been issued to (illegal) shop owners. Thus, totally, I have issued 291 eviction orders. Those who do not go for appeal, CCP will take possession of the stalls after the code of conduct is lifted,” Dessai said. The corporation has issued the order under Section 4(1) of the Goa Pubic (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1988.
 
 Since taking over as the commissioner and backed by the high court order, Dessai has attempted to resolve the logjam over the municipal market complex. A total of 471 illegal occupiers at the Panaji municipal market have either failed to pay rent or sign fresh lease agreements with CCP and are awaiting disposal.
 
 CCP has time till July to execute the high court’s orders to initiate recovery of arrears of rent and evict illegal occupants.
