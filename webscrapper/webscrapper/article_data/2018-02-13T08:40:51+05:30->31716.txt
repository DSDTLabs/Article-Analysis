CHENNAI: The Justice  , which is probing the circumstances surrounding former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death, has given copies of 10 exhibits pertaining to the evidence submitted during deposition, to V K Sasikala’s lawyer.

  is Jayalalithaa’s co-convict in the disproportionate assets case and is serving sentence in the Parappana Agrahara jail near Bengaluru.
 
 “We had demanded all the evidence, but got only copies of the deposition made by witnesses. Today we got 10 sets of exhibits and we will get 450 more in the next two days. Sasikala will file her sworn affidavit by February 26 after going through the documents,” Sasikala’s lawyer, Raja Senthoor Pandian said on Monday, after coming out from the commission’s office.
 
 The judge had passed an order on January 30 based on Sasikala’s petition, which demanded documents pertaining to statements made by other witnesses against her. Only after the evidences were given would Sasikala file her affidavit, her counsel had said.
 
 He also raised doubts if the pen drive containing videos of   taking medical treatment submitted to the commission on behalf of T T V Dhinakaran, were sent for forensic examination. “This is my conjecture,” he said.
