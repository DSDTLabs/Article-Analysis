PANAJI: Goa has acquired the dubious distinction of becoming a hub for   and human trafficking, say organisations that are fighting to tackle the menace of human trafficking. They demanded a special court to conduct trial in   cases. 

 According to statistical data published in a study conducted by Centre for responsible tourism (CRT), 83% women in the tourism industry confirmed that they had bad experiences while interacting with domestic tourists, while only 17% women admitted to have had awkward exchanges with foreigners. 
 
 Arun Pandey, director of NGO Arz, said that human trafficking is most common along the coastal belts. He said that an average of 90-100 women are rescued every year, 25% of the women rescued are local women.
 
 “A Google search for ‘Goa tourism’ led me to find images of bikini-clad foreigners on beaches, apart from some famous tourists destinations, brochures, websites and other forms of tourism advertisement portraying females as erotic and exotic who light up the fantasy of male tourists,” researcher for CRT,   said.
 
 “It is mostly domestic tourists from 18-19 states across India that demand for sex services. Girls from Darjeeling and Northeastern states are brought to Goa to work in massage parlours and are pushed into prostitution. There There are no strict laws to stop this,” Pandey said. He added that there is a need for a dedicated police force to tackle human trafficking in the state. tnn
