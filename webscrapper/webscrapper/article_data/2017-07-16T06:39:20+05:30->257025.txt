BATHINDA: Former state executive committee member of AAP   has asked party MLAs and MPs not to vote for   nominee   in the presidential election to be held on July 17.

 Mahal has asked AAP MLAs and MPs to refrain from voting for Meira if the party was really concerned about the 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims. He also asked party legislatures to clear their stand on 1984 riots and their decision for voting in favour of Congress nominee. 
 
 He said AAP had been blaming Congress for the 1984 riots and was now thinking of voting for its nominee. Mahal, who has also been running a campaign on Facebook for AAP MLAs to make their stand clear about voting for the Congress nominee, said that, “The party must not adopt double standards and make its stand clear by elaborating on the compulsion to vote for the Congress nominee when AAP was pursuing the 1984 anti-Sikh riot cases.”
 
 He said that he had asked AAP chief whip in Punjab   not to issue any directions to MLAs to vote for the Congress nominee. Mahal said former leader of Opposition and MLA H S Phoolka had declared not to vote for the Congress nominee and others must follow suit. Meanwhile, Khaira declined to comment on Mahal’s campaign. He said, “The party has decided to vote for Meira Kumar.”
