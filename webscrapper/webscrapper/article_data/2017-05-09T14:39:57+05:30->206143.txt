INDORE: With depleting water level and reduced supply from regular water sources, industries in Indore region are facing shortage of water. They are counting on availability of tankers to meet operational demand. The advance booking of tankers has gone up to four to five days while prices of tankers have also almost doubled hitting operational costs of the companies. 

 Most of the industries have tied up with tanker suppliers for daily supply for another three months until the regular water supply resumes. Tanker water is costing around Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 depending upon their capacity forcing industries to shell thousands of rupees every day to meet the water requirement, industrialists said. 
 
 A pharmaceutical manufacturer   said, “Industry is completely dependent on tanker water and boring water supply these days. Each pharmaceutical industry is purchasing at least two tankers daily.” 
 
 Pharmaceutical, packaging and textile industries of the region, the major consumer of water in the belt are the worst sufferer due to reduced water supply. 
 
  (AKVN) is also supplying about two million liter per day (MLD) water through tankers to industries based out of Pithampur.
 
  P D  , general manager at a battery manufacturing unit said, “Tankers are not immediately available on a call, we have to intimate them beforehand our requirement.”
