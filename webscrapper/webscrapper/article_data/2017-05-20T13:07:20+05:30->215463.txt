AURANGABAD: The city police have nabbed a conman on the charges of duping several   officials of crores of rupees by claiming to be the personal assistant of state   and Jalna MP  .

 The suspect, identified as  , hails from Bhokardan, the hometown of Danve. He has not only issued orders by forging the signature, stamp and letter head of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis but also collected money promising government jobs.
 
 A senior police officer said, “After some senior government officials started complaining to Danve about the self-proclaimed PA, Danve informed the police and they laid a trap to nab the suspect.
 
 Borse is said to have collected crores of rupees from government officials and others on the pretext of getting their works done.
 
 Aurangabad commissioner of police   told TOI, “The suspect has been arrested and we are trying to nab his two accomplices. As per the primary investigations, the officials posted in different parts of the state, including Pune and Mumbai, have been duped by the suspect.”
 
 Yadav said Borse has collected several crores of rupees from senior officials on the pretext of getting them transferred to postings of their choice. A majority of the cheating took place during the recent general transfers in government departments across the state.
 
 “The case is very sensitive and we are trying to find his source of forged documents and also to identify all the people who have been duped by him,” Yadav said.
 
 Another senior police officer said, “It is more than shocking that the signatures, stamps and letter heads of the chief minister have been forged. It is not possible for the police to cross-check the authenticity of every document we receive.”
