BHAGALPUR: Women candidates have won 36 of the 51 wards of the   (BMC) area. These 36 wards include not only the 25 reserved for women but also 11 general wards from where either men or women could join the fray.

 Of the 52 newly elected councillors, 35 are new faces. In the 2012 election, only 26 women were elected to the BMC.
 
  will have a woman Mayor as the post is reserved for women this time. With women being in majority, it won’t be a surprise if the post of deputy Mayor is also captured by a woman.
 
 Sources said ward councillors belonging to the minority community would play a crucial role in the election of Mayor and deputy Mayor as 19 of the newly elected ward councillors are Muslims. If they collectively decide to vote for a common candidate, s/he would only need votes of seven more councillors to reach the magic figure of 26 to become the first or second citizen of Bhagalpur.
 
 Women contestants who defeated male rivals in the general wards include sitting deputy Mayor  , Rashmi Ranjan, Neetu Devi, Bibi Anwari Khatoon, Pakeejah, Usha Devi, Firoza Aasmeen, Kavita Devi, Anjum Shaheen, Nazma Khatoon and  .
 
 The names of Mayor probables doing the rounds include Seema Sah (wife of   chairman Tuntun Sah who owes allegiance to BJP), Nasreen Begum (a close relative of JD-U’s Rajya Sabha MP  ), Faridaa Aafreen (relative of a prominent silk exporter) and Babita Devi (relative of a health department official). The post, incidentally, is reserved for backward women.
 
 Tough fight is also likely for the post of deputy Mayor. Outgoing deputy Mayor Preeti Shekhar (who is associated with BJP) has already made it known that she would again throw her hat in the ring.
