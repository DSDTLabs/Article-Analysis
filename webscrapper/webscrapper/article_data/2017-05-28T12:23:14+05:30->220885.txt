PANAJI: Muslims across the state are all set to observe the month-long fast as the holy month of   commenced on Saturday evening.

 Based on the lunar calendar, Ramzan occurs in the ninth month of the Islamic schedule.
 
 During this time, Muslims fast for a period of 30 days as an exercise in self-control and humility. 
 
 Members of the association of all   jamaat who form the hilal committee in Goa confirmed sighting of the crescent moon thus in ushering the holy month. 
 
 Muslims follow a moon-sighting (hilal) methodology that can differ from country-to-country. Resultantly, the start of Ramzan also differs by a day or two apart in various parts of the world. 
 
 The first installment of the sacred namaz, Taraveeh was offered in mosques across the state on Saturday night. 
 
 Muslims in Goa are thus observing the first roza (fast) from the dawn of Sunday. Most believers refrain from celebrating functions like weddings, birthdays etc during the Islamic month. 
 
 However, iftaar parties are a popular form of social gathering during which people break the fast together and offer prayers thereafter. Besides fasting, Muslims spend the month offering an increased amount of prayers, Quran recital, and engage in acts of charity through the month. 
 
 The month long fast and prayer concludes with Eid-ul-Fitr, which will be celebrated in June.
