Surat: Impure water poses serious health risks to people living in four housing societies on Aswinikumar Road in Katargam zone in the city. They have been getting coloured water in their water taps for the past three days.

 Officials of hydraulic department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) have not done anything about it so far.
 
 Over 1,000 people live in Saraswati Society, Rambag Society no 2 and two other housing societies in this area which also houses at least 11 dyeing mills. People say these mills allegedly release waste water into drainage which gets mixed up with water supply pipelines. 
 
 Congress councillor Dinesh Kachadia said, “It has become difficult for residents of these societies to live in their homes as the coloured water has pungent smell. People have been forced to spray their own houses for the past two days.” 
 
 A resident said, “This issue crops up every now and then. We need a permanent solution to this problem.” 
 
 Presently, only a small portion of waste water has entered the water pipelines. However, if the leakage is not checked soon, the problem will assume dangerous proportions and more housing societies will get affected, sources said. 
 
 There is a plan to move out these dyeing mills from the residential areas. Mill owners are demanding built structures with other facilities from the state government, which so far has not agreed to it.
