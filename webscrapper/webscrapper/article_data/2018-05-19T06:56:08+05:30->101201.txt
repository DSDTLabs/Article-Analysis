PUNE: Any relief from the oppressive heat in the city just evaporated even though day temperatures have fallen over the last few days . 

 The mercury is expected to soar once again from May 25, especially over central and northwest India, including  . Temperatures could be above the normal by 4-6 degrees celsius with a possibility of heatwave conditions in some parts, an extended range forecast from   (IMD) said.
 
 Parts of northwest India,  , including Maharashtra could have day temperatures close to 40 degrees celsius and above during the period May 25 to 31, the forecast based on weather models said.
 
 Currently, temperatures in the state have come down considerably. From the high 40 degrees celsius reported in many locations, day temperatures in seven locations in Madhya Maharashtra recently saw the mercury dip below though day temperatures in Vidarbha remain high.
 
 A senior met department official told TOI that strong northwesterly winds from Afghanistan and Pakistan are expected to blow into northwest India and central India. “These winds are hot and tend to increase the temperatures of the regions they blow into. Central India, including Maharashtra, is likely to experience the effect of these winds. Most parts of northwest India and central India are expected to be under the influence of hot weather conditions, including the possibility of a heatwave during that period,” the official said.
 
 Meanwhile, based on this extended range forecast, the met department has predicted monsoon to make a landfall over Kerala around May 29. 
 
 A weather system over the Arabian Sea around May 23 could have brought monsoon over Kerala a little earlier than usual. However, weather models are currently showing that the system may have a westward movement in the Arabian Sea, which is unlikely to help the monsoon flow. 
 
 The monsoon flow is expected to establish over the Kerala coast during the end of May after this system moves away.
