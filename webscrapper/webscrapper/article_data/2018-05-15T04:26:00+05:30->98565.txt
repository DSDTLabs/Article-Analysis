Ahmedabad: With an eye on the approaching month of Ramzan and the   after it, K L N Rao, special commissioner of police, Sector I, held a crime conference with senior officers including the DCPs of Zones I, II, III and VII on Monday afternoon.

 Officials said crime statistics for the month of April and the first four months of the year were discussed. Compared to the same period in 2017, there have been more cases of murder and attempted murder, while there have been fewer offences such as vehicle theft, house break-ins and chain snatchings.
 
 A few areas, such as Sabarmati and Chandkheda, reported increases in vehicle thefts and chain snatchings. A few major thefts in Satellite and Anandnagar have also remained undetected. Officials have been asked to look into these cases and increase vigilance.
 
 “Officials have been asked to gear up for the coming bandobast and reach out to citizens for effective policing,” said Rao.
 
 The month of Ramzan will start soon and police personnel in police stations like Karanj, Shahpur, Gaekwad Haveli and Sarkhej will be on alert. The focus will also be on the route of the Rath Yatra, which will be taken out in July, for which preparations will start soon. Area meetings will take place over the next two months, from police inspector to police commissioner level, said a senior city police official.
 
 Hawk squads to get reflective jackets
 
 Senior city police officials said the Hawk Squads, motorcycle-borne constables at the police station level, will be given reflective jackets. Officials said this will increase visibility of policemen, especially at crowded places and will work as a deterrent for crimes such as chain snatchings, bag and mobile snatching and robbery. These squads will especially be deployed in crowded public places, they added.
