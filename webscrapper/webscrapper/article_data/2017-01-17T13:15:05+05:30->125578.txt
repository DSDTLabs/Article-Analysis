Actress   believes it is possible for an actor to have a film career and find love. 

  
  
 The ' ' star, who is still very close with her ex   despite their split - says balancing a career in the film industry and having a family and love life is all 'just about prioritising'.
 
 "I don't think it's mutually exclusive, career or love.   seems very in love with her husband. That's a very great family and she's the best there is. So people can find a way to do both, it's just about prioritising," she said. However, the 28-year-old actress doesn't believe in a 'happily ever after' but insists that doesn't mean a person can't be 'happy in a different way'.
