Mumbai: In an exclusive interview to TOI immediately after meeting the media,   CEO   on Monday described a whistleblower letter as “a malicious, slanderous and personal attack on me by diabolical minds. I will not tolerate it. If somebody attacks me personally, we will follow whatever legal recourse we have to go after that”.

 The letter alleges that former CFO   was paid a massive Rs 17.4 crore as severance in exchange for his silence on certain accounting practices and an overseas acquisition.
 
  Asked about Narayana Murthy’s support for US-based finance professor Marti G Subrahmanyam as co-chair, Infy chairman R Seshasayee told TOI, “It is for us to say whether Marti is the right person, or somebody else is the right person.”
 
  We have to take a decision; we will take the decision in the interest of shareholders at large.”
