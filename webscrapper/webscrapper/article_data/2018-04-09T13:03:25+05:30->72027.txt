PATNA: Several passengers travelling in the Chandigarh-Pataliputra Express (22356) on the night of Friday-Saturday expressed their anguish at the poor quality of food served to them on the train. They lodged complaints with the   vendors, who served meals and breakfast to them on the running train. The train had reached   about eight hours behind the schedule on the intervening night of Friday-Saturday. 

 Giving vent to their feelings,   and his family, who boarded the train at Chandigarh, said they were travelling in the AC coach B2. “As the pantry car service was not available in the train, we ordered for meals and breakfast through the IRCTC mobile vendors. While we insisted on getting bill, the vendor charged Rs 100 per vegetarian meal,” Singh said, adding the quality was so poor that they were forced to throw the food into dustbin.
 
 Manjeet Singh, who was travelling in the same coach with his wife and two minor children, said while the vendors exorbitantly charged Rs 100 per vegetarian meal, rice was not fully boiled and ‘chappatis’ were not fully baked also.
 
 Repeated calls to IRCTC’s PRO (Delhi)   and its regional manager (Patna) on their cellphone numbers went unanswered.
