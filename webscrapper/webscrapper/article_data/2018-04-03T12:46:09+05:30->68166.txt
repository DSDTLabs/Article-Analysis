BAMBOLIM: Goa has started providing holistic assistance under one roof to minor victims of abuse.

 The victim assistance unit operating from the   (GMC) and Hospital will provide police assistance, counselling and sociolegal assistance. The rehabilitation of the victims will be carried out at the victim assistance unit (VAU).
 
  Rashmi   of the   police station has been temporarily posted at VAU with immediate effect. Emidio   who heads the unit said on an average about 22 cases are referred to them every month by various police stations .
 
 Due to paucity of time, we are unable to attend to more cases and provide holistic assistance in one place, he said. Pinho said the facility has been created under the Goa Childrenâ€™s Act, and no other state in the country has such a facility till date.
 
 The cases that are attended by VAU range from sexual abuse of children, kidnapping, mental torture to child witnesses.
 
 The VAU has a counsellor, legal advisor as well as a social worker to help a victim overcome trauma and lead a normal life. He said though they receive cases of children of all ages, their youngest victim was a 13-month-old baby, two years ago.
