Surat: The Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) has asked the additional chief secretary of the industries and mines department to conduct an enquiry into the appointment of a realtor as the board of director of the Sachin Notified Area Authority (SNAA).  A few members in the Sachin Industrial Cooperative Society Limited (SICSL) had opposed the appointment of D M Patel, a realtor and former employee of the GIDC, as the board director director of Sachin Notified Area Authority by the department of industries and mines, government of Gujarat.  Ramaben Ramoliya, former secretary of SICSL, had written letter to chief minister Vijay Rupani urging to cancel the appointment of Dinesh M Patel as the board director of Sachin Notified Area Authority. Ramoliya alleged that Patel does not own even a single foot of land at the GIDC and that the earlier management of the SICSL had never recommended Patel’s name as the board member.  Talking to TOI, Ramoliya said, “Patel is not an industrialist, he is a realtor. Still, due to the blessings of some senior officers in GIDC and the present body of SICSL, his name was referred to the government for the notified area authority. He (Patel) is not owing a single feet of land at Sachin GIDC” Ramoliya added, “The CMO has ordered the additional chief secretary of the industries and mines department to carry out investigation into the appointment of DM Patel. If the government would fail to revoke the appointment order, the member of SICSL will sit on indefinite hunger strike.” When contacted, Dinesh M Patel stated that he is ready to face any inquiry from the industries and mines department.  “I have never approached the government or the authority to take me on the board. Still, if the government feels I am not fit for the post, they can remove me. I don’t care about people like Ramoliya who have no other business to perform,” said Patel.
