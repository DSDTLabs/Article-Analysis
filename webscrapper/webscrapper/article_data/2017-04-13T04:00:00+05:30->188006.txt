Mumbai: The government has agreed not to reduce any   as part of a bank turnaround plan, without consulting with staff associations. This assurance by the government has paved the way for employee associations signing a contract, where they have agreed to work with banks and government on a recapitalisation plan. The Centre had insisted on employees signing this memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government and bank management as a precondition for infusing capital into weak banks.

 According to D Thomas Franco, senior vice-president of the  , the government had forced the associations to sign an MoU by refusing to part with capital without the agreement. “We agreed to sign the agreement only after the government agreed on a clause that employee allowances would not be revised without consultation with the associations,” said Franco.
 
 The government has given   the mandate to draw up a bank-wise action plan for turnaround. According to Franco, the details have not been shared with the association. “We are doing an analysis on our own of each bank’s performance over the last 10 years. We have also asked the   to come out with an alternative plan for turnaround,” he said. While the   will come out with its report before April end, AIBOC would finalise its proposals by May 10.
 
 “Everyone knows that the problem is that of loans by large corporates turning into non-performing assets, and cutting on small expenses does not help,” Franco said. He added that associations feared branch and staff rationalisation as proposals to cut costs. “In India, we have only one bank branch for every 10,000 citizens as against 6,000 in Brazil or 4,000 in the US,” he said.
 
 The association is also pushing for implementing recommendations made by the parliamentary standing committee on finance to improve corporate governance.
