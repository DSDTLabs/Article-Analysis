QUEPEM: Plans are afoot to keep paddy fields along the route of the   canal fallow for one season to allow repairs to the decades-old water source. The move is expected to address complaints from farmers of inadequate water supply for their crops.

 The 17-km-long canal was built in 1952 during the Portuguese regime. It originates at Bhat (Quepem), passes through municipal areas and the villages of Paroda, Chandor and Guirdolim, and terminates at Macazana. A 138-metre stretch of the canal runs beneath the garden in Quepem town and the   road. 
 
 Farmers have, in recent years, complained of major leakages at several points in the canal, due to which they haven’t been able to cultivate their fields as often as they used to during the last five decades. Even sources from the public works department (PWD) said unavailability of water in the Paroda canal had often prompted the release of water from the Selaulim irrigation canal. Taking cognisance of the complaints, Cuncolim MLA Clafacio Dias has requested farmers from Paroda, Chandor, Guirdolim and Macazana to keep their fields unploughed for one season to allow the canal to be repaired. 
 
 “I have already informed the panchayats concerned to take up the issue at their ensuing gram sabhas. If they agree, I will put the proposal before the water resources minister to prepare estimates,” Dias told TOI.
 
 Assistant engineer, works division II, R Sawant, said the PWD had, in November last year, spent Rs 25 lakh towards desilting and plastering the canal from Quepem to Guirdolim. “Desilting is done annually. As much as 30-50cm of silt is removed,” he said. The department, however, has no record of when the underground stretch of the canal was last cleaned.
