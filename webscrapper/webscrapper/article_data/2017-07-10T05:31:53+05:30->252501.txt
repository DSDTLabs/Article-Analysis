GURUGRAM: Haryana State Pollution Control Board ( ) has collected a penalty of Rs 1.5 crore from developers operating in   cities of Haryana for violating construction and   pollution   in the past one year.

 According to HSPCB officials, regular inspections and rising awareness among public, of reporting dust pollution violations, has led to stricter action against offenders. 
 
 “We have conducted regular inspections to strictly impose directions given by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on construction and dust pollution. However, the idea is not just to penalise offenders, but to make sure the norms are followed,” said a senior official of HSPCB. 
 
 There are more than 180 construction sites that were sent notices by HSPCB to follow NGT’s dust pollution norms in the last one year. Over 100 individuals and organisations were given notices, who had violated   and burnt waste in the open. While most organisations faced penalties ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 5 lakh, individuals were fined Rs 5,000.
 
  “Most of the time, action was taken only on small developers. One will still find big construction sites on Golf Course Road, SPR, NPR and Sohna road, flouting the norms. That is why, steps taken by the board haven’t had any significant impact on the level of dust pollution in the city,” alleged Neeta Bajaj, a resident of Golf Course Road (extension), who filed the complaint on dust pollution violations. 
 
 In April 2015, NGT gave strict instructions to the civic authority (MCG) and monitoring agency (HSPCB), to check dust pollution caused by construction. There are more than 1,200 construction sites in and around Gurgaon.
