Visakhapatnam: District collector   on Wednesday urged officials of the tourism department to identify land and set up a committee to formulate a plan for setting up a   aircraft museum in the city, along the lines of the   aircraft museum that was inaugurated late last year by President Ram Nath Kovind.

 The district collector was conducting a review meeting of various tourism projects to be developed in the city and surrounding areas. 
 
 During the meeting that was held at the collectorate, Kumar said plans are afoot to establish a major tourist circuit in the region with Vizag city as its epicentre.

The collector further said the construction of the four luxury cottages in Lammasinghi must be completed by the end of March.
