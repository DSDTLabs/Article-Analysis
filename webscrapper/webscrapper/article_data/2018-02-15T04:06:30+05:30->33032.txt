MUMBAI: Roughly 50,000 children across India get   every year, but there are less than 40 pediatric oncologists in the country.

He said pediatric cancers were different from adult cancer.
 
 The skewed patient-doctor equation has spurred the country’s premier cancer care hub,   Memorial Hospital, to offer its expertise   at a subsidised cost.

 Tata Memorial Hospital’s pediatric oncology team treated 2,800 cancer cases in 2016. “There is a roughly 5% increase in cases every year but centres in Mumbai and Delhi are overcrowded,’’ said Dr Banavali. Such measures will help distribute the treatment across the country.
