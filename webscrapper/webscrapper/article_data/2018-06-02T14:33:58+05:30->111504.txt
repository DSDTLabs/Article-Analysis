COIMBATORE: Defending actor   for his comments on anti–Sterlite protests,   state president   said the actor never intended to term the protesting public as anti–social elements. Talking to reporters here on Friday, Tamilisai said there was growing intolerance for diverse opinions in Tamil Nadu. “This intolerance for alternative views has resulted in scathing attacks. Rajinikanth has made a bold statement and it should be welcomed,’’ she said. 

 
 The BJP leader said anti–social elements infiltrating public protests cannot be encouraged. “Such a situation would result in danger for the state. We do not trivialize protests. At the same time the opposition parties should not create a perpetually protesting Tamil Nadu,’’ she said. Endorsing Rajinikanth’s view, she said the opposition parties were instigating series of protests only to make Tamil Nadu graveyard. tnn
