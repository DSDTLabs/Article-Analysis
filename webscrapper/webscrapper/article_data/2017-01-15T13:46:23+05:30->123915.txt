 Addressing the speculations that follow-ups to 2015's 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' the 39-year-old said he is waiting for director   to give him a call about reprising his role, reported The Wrap.
 
 Hardy said,"Yeah I believe so! I don't know when that starts, but I believe that's in the books. There's a couple of those floating around. I'm waiting for the call to come. It was so good man".
 
 The award-winning filmmaker had said at the beginning of 2016 that he wants to make two more 'Mad Max' movies.
