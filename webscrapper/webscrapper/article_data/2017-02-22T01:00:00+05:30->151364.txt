Amar Upadhyay, currently seen in ' ', set a good example of a responsible citizen while he was shooting at Madh Island, recently. He came across a group of three guys who were clicking pictures on the beach. He soon realised they were sneakily taking photographs of some girls. Amar confronted the trio and asked them to erase all the pictures. A verbal spat ensued and finally, the actor snatched the cameras and deleted the pics himself. 
Says Amar, “I first thought the boys were practising photography on the beach, but when I saw what they were actually doing, I was aghast. As responsible citizens, it is our duty to raise voice against such wrong happenings.”
