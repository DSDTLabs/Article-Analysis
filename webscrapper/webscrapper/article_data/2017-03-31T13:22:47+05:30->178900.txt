LUCKNOW: Sharply reacting to former Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey’s claims that he was right in appointing   as the leader of opposition as has been the convention and done twice in the past, Governor   on Thursday said that “two wrongs cannot make a right”.

 A controversy over the appointment of the leader of opposition by outgoing Speaker Pandey is snowballing into a major issue. In his second letter in three days to the Assembly and new Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit on Thursday, Naik stated that his concern should be addressed. How could an outgoing Speaker who has lost the election and was not a member of the house appoint the leader of opposition, he asked.
 
 Four days ago, Pandey had appointed Chaudhary as the leader of opposition for being the leader of SP’s legislature party, without waiting for the election of the new Speaker. The governor objected to it and wrote to the assembly about the “unconstitutional” manner in which Pandey had notified the appointment of Chaudhary. Besides, Naik was of the opinion that this job should have been done by the new Speaker.
 
 Reacting to Naik’s letter against him, Pandey released his reply to the media, maintaining that since it had been the convention and done twice in the past, he was fully justified. Taking note, Naik shot another letter to the new Speaker and the assembly that Pandey should understand the basic principle that two wrongs never make a right and a wrong is a wrong. He has also requested that the new Speaker takes note of it and reviews the appointment of the leader of opposition.
