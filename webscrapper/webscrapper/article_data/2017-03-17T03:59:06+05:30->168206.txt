 plans to make Lonavla, Neral and Matheran stations tourist-friendly by putting up history of the ghats, images of nearby tourist spots and a map of the area on the platforms.

 Ravindra Goyal, CR divisional railway manager, said the three stations attract a lot of tourists round the year. “We plan to provide detailed maps and history of the three stations. We are also planning photo exhibitions at these stations,” he said. CR also plans to develop the area around Bhushi dam in Lonavla. Nearly 10 acres available near the dam can be beautified.
