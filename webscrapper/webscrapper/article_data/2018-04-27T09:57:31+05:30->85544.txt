BENGALURU: PM Narendra Modi’s claim on Thursday that his NDA government had spent Rs 2,100 crore on construction of toilets in   triggered a war between   supporters and   wokers on Twitter and other social media platforms.

 Minutes after the PM’s nearly 45-minute interaction with his state party workers through a mobile app, BJP’s social media unit put out a comparative statement on household toilets constructed during the first four years of Congress-led   government and four years of NDA government. The BJP claimed that 34 lakh toilets were constructed at a cost of Rs 2,100 crore by the Modi regime under Swachh Bharat Mission while the progress made during the UPA rule was 20 lakh toilets at a cost of Rs 350 crore.
 
 In the Twitter war that ensued, Congress questioned BJP about the cost escalation. The Congress tweeted: “Cost of construction per toilet was Rs 1,750 under UPA and Rs 6,177 under NDA”, Congress tweeted and sought to know how the cost rocketed under Modi.
 
 Joining the tirade, Congress social media incharge Divya Spandana (Ramya) stated: “BJP walo toilet to chod do. Sab mein scam! #ToiletEk-ScamKatha”
 
 BJP countered: “Dear @INCIndia, do not stoop lower than your President’s IQ. Central govt gave Karnataka govt Rs 2,100 crores for toilet construction. If you say not enough toilets were built, ask Mr. SiddhaRupaiya!”
 
 Aam Aadmi Party too took potshots at BJP with a tweet that read: “Difference in number of toilets – Rs 14 lakh (sic). Difference in cost – Rs 1,750 crore. Where has the rest of money gone?”
