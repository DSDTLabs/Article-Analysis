 Rohit led India during the final T20I against South Africa in Cape Town on Saturday after skipper Kohli reported unfit for the game. He had also captained India successfully in ODIs and T20s against Sri Lanka in December last at home. "MS Dhoni was not available for selection as he had requested for rest. We've kept in mind the workload and upcoming schedule while finalizing the team for Nidahas Trophy. Our high-performance unit has suggested that adequate rest should be given to our fast bowlers to help improve performance and prevent injury," senior selection committee chairman MSK Prasad said.
 
 In Dhoni's absence, the wicketkeeping slot will be a toss up between Dinesh Karthik and Rishabh Pant who are in the squad while Tamil Nadu all-rounder   is likely to fill in for Pandya. Baroda batsman   and Hyderabad fast bowler   have also been named in the squad.
 
 Karnataka batsman  , who has scored more than 2,000 runs in various formats in the ongoing domestic season, did not find a place.
