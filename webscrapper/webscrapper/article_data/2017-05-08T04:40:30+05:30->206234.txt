NEW DELHI: Swaraj India’s   on Sunday responded with caution to the row between   and Kapil Mishra. Yadav said such allegations needed to be substantiated with evidence. The former AAP member, however, called the party a “sinking ship” while referring to a “naked power struggle”.

 “I might agree with charges of power greed, arrogance, authoritarianism against Kejriwal, but charges of taking bribe need solid evidence (sic),” he tweeted. Yadav clarified that he was not backing Kejriwal, but merely saying that allegations of corruption must be backed by evidence.
 
 Yadav, who was among the founding members of AAP but quit over ideological differences, said the party had compromised on ethics. He said: “While   is using all foul means to murder AAP, the party is determined to commit suicide. It is morally and politically dead.” 
 
 He said AAP had compromised on three key factors — ethical politics, good governance and electoral viability — which formed the foundation of the party.
 
 Prashant Bhushan, who along with Yadav formed   after quitting AAP, tweeted: “The true test of character comes in adversity. We are now seeing the true faces of AAP's remnants as its ship sinks. What an opportunity lost (sic).”
 
 Yadav quoted Bhushan’s tweet to respond: “True. We are witnessing mudslinging in a sinking ship. No one comes clean in this naked power struggle.”
 
 In a post on another social networking site, Anupam, spokesperson of  , wrote: “What is happening within AAP is a natural corollary to its misdeeds and misadventures over the last two years. A party founded to take on and change the existing political culture was unfortunately reduced by Kejriwal to a mechanical election machine in his sheer lust for power. And when winning at all costs, even at the cost of your values, morality and core principles becomes your guiding light, it is always a death knell.”
