 Fire officials said some workers noticed columns of smoke coming out of the factory's chemicals department at 8.30pm. 
 
 "As of now, 40 fire tenders and hundreds of fire officers are fighting to bring the flames under control." But there was no sign of the fire dying down when reports last came in and the officer described the situation as "not optimistic".
