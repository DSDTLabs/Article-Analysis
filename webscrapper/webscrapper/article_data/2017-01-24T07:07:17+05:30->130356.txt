HYDERABAD:  's   for state is now being challenged by a cheaper, local version of irrigating land. He is now being urged to adopt the   (FWC) developed by renowned engineer   which could bring down the   lakhs of acres.

 Addressing the media here on Monday, senior Congress leader Marri Sashidhar Reddy said that while Telangana government was planning major lift irrigation projects at a cost of about '5 lakh an acre with a recurring cost of a minimum of' 50,000 acre annually to provide water for irrigation for a single irrigated dry (ID) crop, Hanumantha Rao's FWC would result in the provision of water for irrigation of three crops in a year at a cost of only ` 5,000acre.
 
 He pointed out that Gottigaripalli near Zaheerabad was implementing the scheme and has successfully overcome two successive droughts. He also said that the Rajasthan government was following a similar programme to provide water for the drought-prone areas in the state.
 
 A consultation meeting was held to elicit opinion and suggestions of people from different walks of life on the way forward in implementation of T Hanumantha Rao's concept, he said.“At this meeting of about 100 people, a major consensus emerged on the need to convince the state government to take this concept forward.In this regard, it was decided that we should seek an appointment with the CM to make a presentation on Hanumantha Rao's concept for watershed development so that the CM fully apprecia tes its role in drastically reducing investments in the irrigation sector and divert scarce funds to other important sectors to achieve balanced growth,“ Sashidhar said.
 
 “There is a unanimous resolution that FWC is a pioneering concept that has relevance for our current times as it is an eco-friendly model of development, fully in tune with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,“ he said.
 
 He requested the chief minister to give time to him to present the FWC and also submit a roadmap to implement it across the state.
