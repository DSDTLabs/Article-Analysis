NEW DELHI: An investigation has revealed that love and not terror had forced   alias   - the LeT man held in Kashmir last week - to convert to Islam. Sources said that Sharma had converted and took the name of Adil to marry a woman he had fallen in love in Kashmir. 

 In the last two-three days, sleuths and cops conducted raids in Delhi to track down the contractor who had earlier employed Sharma and sent him to work in J&K.
 
 The contractor told cops that Sharma worked in power grids and he had sent him and three others to Kashmir. "While Asif and Yogesh returned to UP after work, Sandeep fell in love with the daughter of a retired sub-inspector there," the contractor said. 
 
  As the woman's family didn't allow the marriage due to Sharma being from another religion, the LeT member allegedly converted to Islam at a local mosque in presence of some maulvis and subsequently got married. 
 
 He also formally changed his name to Adil, an officer said. Adil then took to commercial driving in Anantnag and Pulwama apart from his welding works to make money but could only make around Rs 300 per day. 
 
 Around this time, Adil met Shakoor, an LeT operative, who offered him a huge chunk of money and used his welding abilities to rob ATMs.
