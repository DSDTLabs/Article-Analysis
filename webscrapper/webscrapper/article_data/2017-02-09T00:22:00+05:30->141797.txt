Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission (MPHRC) on Tuesday took cognizance of the incident wherein an undertrial in Niwari prison of Tikamgarh district lodged a complaint of being sodomised in jail during a court hearing on February 4.

 The commission has sought a report from director general (prisons) in this regard. The matter was reported in TOI on Tuesday. Complainant told the court that he has undergoing torture in jail for long and he even complained about it to jail officials, but nothing happened. Complainant had told court that jailer Praveen Tripathi, jail sentry Ashok Kushwah and an undertrial in a murder case, Hiralal Yadav, perpetrated atrocities on him.
 
 Subsequently, the court ordered to register a case under sections 377 (unnatural sex) and 506 (threat to kill) against the jailer in question and two others after the undertrial lodged a complaint during the court hearing. A case was registered against the trio on February 4. Police said the incident had taken place close on the heels of suspected death of a convict in the same jail in December 2016. The convict allegedly committed suicide inside the jail and the jailer was already facing an inquiry in the case.
 
 Besides, seeking report DG prisons, the commission recommended proper healthcare facilities for inmates in jails. The commission observed that jail inmates are not being given proper healthcare facilities in the state. The commission pointed that there have been several incidents where jail officials could not gauge the seriousness of the poor health of the prisoners that led to their death.
