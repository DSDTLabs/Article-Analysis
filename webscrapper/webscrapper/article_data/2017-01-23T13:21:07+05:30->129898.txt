BENGALURU:  , near Vijayanagar, west Bengaluru, turned into a selfie zone on Sunday. Residents posed for photos with the saplings they were planting by the roadside, thanks to an innovative attempt by an all-woman residents' group to harness the power of selfies to green their locality. 

  Bandhavya, the 60-member group, got people to plant over 70 saplings on the occasion. Residents will be taking selfies with the saplings over the year, while monitoring their progress. The best-performing plant will be given a prize at the end of the year. 
 
  "We wanted to do something that would make a difference," said  , president of the recently formed group. 
 
  The drive began with 105-year-old environmentalist   planting the first sapling. She has planted and tended 400 banyan trees along the 4km stretch of the highway between Hulikal and Kudur. 
 
  "Usually, people plant a sapling and go away, but we wanted to involve the younger generation. This seemed the perfect way to go green," said Manjula. 
 
  "While we all wanted to plant saplings, we didn't know where to do so. We then approached the local corporator," she pointed out. 
 
  Many kids who participated in the drive intend to revisit their saplings over the weeks. As many saplings die within a few months, the selfie challenge will ensure their progress is monitored and they are properly watered. Local corporator   and MLA V Somanna were present at the event.
