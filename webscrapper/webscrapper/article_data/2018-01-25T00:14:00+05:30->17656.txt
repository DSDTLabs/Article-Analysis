Chennai: Any average city dweller would have noted the availability of only Rs 500 and Rs 100   at ATMs whereas the absence of   and  ,000 notes would be pronounced. 

 While Rs 200 notes are unavailable because of the slow pace of   of   machines, non-availability of Rs 2,000 notes makes them elusive. Bankers say that the new Rs 2,000 notes are in short supply with many of them not receiving the notes even for disbursals within their branches. When it comes to Rs 200 notes, the cost of recalibration per ATM is between Rs 2,500 and Rs 5,000 and banks are shying away from further expense. For ATM operators and banks, costs have shot sky-high since demonetisation and the reduction in note supply. Furthermore, there is a reluctance to push hard for distribution of Rs 200 notes. 
 
 “The key issue is compensation. In many cases, we have not been paid for the cost of recalibration from November 8, 2016. Once we come to an agreement with banks as to the costs of recalibration, you can see more Rs 200 notes in circulation,” says V Balasubramanian, president, retail payments, FSS.
 
 ATM operators say that up to June 2017, the industry lost Rs 400 crore because of demonetisation. “Media reports that the cost of recalibration would be Rs 1,000 crore, which we feel is exaggerated, has also caused hesitation among banks,” said the head of an ATM service provider.
 
 “In November 2016, there was immense pressure put on us by RBI and the government; banks gave us the assurance that costs would be taken care of. We set up war rooms and worked 24X7, but when it came to payments, banks later backed off. For more than five months, they did not pay us and later paid only partially. So given the cost recalibration of Rs 200 notes, which might be a quarter of what we incurred during demonetisation, both banks and ATM operators are going slow,” he added.
