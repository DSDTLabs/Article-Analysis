 TRICHY: A year after finding a few fragmented pieces of urn along the Vilvanni river bank near Keeranur in   district, a team of 10 archaeological enthusiasts during a study in the vicinity has stumbled on an age-old   (  in Tamil).
 
 Researchers believe the oval-shaped patterns, on the surface, could be at least 2,500 years old and may have been used by the ancients for worship. Further to the discovery of labyrinth, the archaeological researchers urged the government to consider launching excavation to identify any evidence of early human settlements at the same site in Pudukkottai district. According to A Manikan dan, founder of Archaeological Research   that researched along the banks of Vilvanni river, the labyrinth pattern was said to be spotted recently at a secluded place near Ambalathidal. The labyrinth was said to be in practice and used during the Neolithic period as a spiritual tool for the ancients to wor ship, said the Pudukkottaibased researchers. However, the labyrinth was not strictly restricted to a particular civilisation since the patterns in recent years were discovered in Dharmapuri and Coimbatore districts, and in Crete as well. Crete is one of the numerous isles that make up the archipelago of Greece.
 
 “The ancients had been using the labyrinth pattern to pray by navigating through the lines to the nucleus. The pattern found near the banks of the Vilvanni river in Ambalathidal was made out of a mixture comprising limestone and pebbles. It is quite surprising to see the patterns have remained intact, possibly due to less human movement in the secluded spot,“   said.
