GURUGRAM: The family of a local journalist claimed on Saturday that it received “a phone call demanding Rs 50,000” just one day prior to his arrest on Friday. Pradeep Nirala was arrested on charges of criminal conspiracy after being detained by cops for three days in connection with a murder case in Badshapur .

 Refuting allegations of Pradeep’s involvement in the murder, his lawyer Yatish Goel and his brother Hariom Nirala said the “least the phone call proves is that he was in police custody before the cops formally showed him where he actually was”.
 
 According to Goel, Pradeep’s son got the call on his mobile phone on Thursday. 
 
 “The caller, who identified himself as Arij Khan, asked his son to arrange Rs 50,000 and bring it to the police station,” he said at a press conference in Gurugram.
 
 In the recorded phone conversation, a copy of which is with TOI, the man (Khan) tells Pradeep’s son that his father is in bad shape and has been beaten up at the police station. He is also told to collect the laptop from Badshapur police chowki, and to take the motorbike as well.
 
 Pradeep’s family rubbished claims that he had been involved in brokering a deal on behalf of the accused in an earlier attempt to murder case that eventually led to the killing of 43-year-old Badshapur resident Anand Vashishtha on Tuesday.
 
 “Even if he has done anything wrong it should have been produced as evidence in the court. Thus despite police insistence for 10-day custody, Pradeep was sent him to judicial remand,” said Goel.
