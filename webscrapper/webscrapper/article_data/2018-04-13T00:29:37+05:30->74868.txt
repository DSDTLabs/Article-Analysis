MUMBAI: A   on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to   in an alleged   case over a prime plot of land in Khar. The criminal case is filed against Bhojwani by actress  ,   of her husband, veteran actor  . 

 Bhojwani sought pre-arrest bail as the economic offences wing had registered an FIR in December 2017 which refers to transaction of sale of reversionary rights in immovable property sold by the trustees of Seth Mulraj Khatau Trust Settlement in 1980. Banu alleged that Bhojwani forged the deed of conveyance for the plot without annexing power of attorney, thus cheating her and the registration authority. 
 
 Special public prosecutor Raja Thakre and defence counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Bhojwani, have argued in the case before Judge M M Umar earlier. Banu had also intervened through her counsel Harshad Ponda and advocate Sameer Nangre to oppose his plea.
 
 Bhojwani claimed rights over the land which he said his father had obtained from the trust. Desai said the FIR was “belated” and an “abuse of legal process”. He argued that an eviction suit filed in 2010 by Bhojwani against Banu had led to disputes but no allegations of forgery were made though “Dilip Kumar knew all the facts since the 1990s”. Thakre argued that Bhojwani relied on forged documents to claim rights over the plot. He claimed Bhojwani’s custodial interrogation was required to find out who from the registration department had helped him procure forged documents. The the probe reflects evidence of forgery, he argued. 
 
 In January, the court had granted Bhojwani interim protection against arrest. His counsel claimed the case appears to be motivated by vested interests of other developers interested in the property. Bhojwani, in his pl-ea filed through advocate Parim-al Shroff, said, “The FIR stands registered on...absurd and prepo-sterous complaint filed by Banu.”
