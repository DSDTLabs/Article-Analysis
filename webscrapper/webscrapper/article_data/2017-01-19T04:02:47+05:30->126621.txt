MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Wednesday warned the Railways that it will initiate contempt proceedings against the   of   if it does not abide by its undertaking to make all suburban stations disabled-friendly according to an NGO’s audit report.

 “We are putting you to notice. Go by this report. Accept it as gospel truth and make compliance,’’ said a bench headed by Justice Abhay Oka. The court heard a PIL by India Centre for Human Rights and Law. The HC had earlier directed the Railways to complete work on providing amenities, including ramps, low-height booking windows and drinking water taps. When the NGO checked, it found several deficiencies. The Railways opposed the appointment of an independent access auditor but subsequently agreed to accept the NGO’s audit report.
 
 Submitting the audit report, the NGO’s advocate, Kranti LC, said overall compliance was only 37%. “The conclusion is a bleak picture,’’ he said. The judges pointed out that the Railways were unwilling to appoint an auditor, saying they had no money. “The only thing to be done is for you to give a clear undertaking that deficiencies will be fixed in a particular time,’’ said Justice Oka.
 
 The Railways was granted three weeks to study the report and make a statement on compliances. Posting the matter on February 9, the judges said no more time will be given. “Any effort made to back out from the undertaking, the general managers of both the railways will be pulled up for contempt. We’ll not show leniency now,’’ said Justice Oka.
