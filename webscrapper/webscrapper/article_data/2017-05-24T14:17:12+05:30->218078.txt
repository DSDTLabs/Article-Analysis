Veteran Telugu actor   faced the ire of women’s organisations for his lewd comments on women at the pre-launch function of Nagarjuna’s   movie.
Terming the actor’s comments ‘derogatory and sexist’, women’s organisations in the city have lodged a complaint against the actor at the   in city on Tuesday morning.
 Kondaveeti Satyavati, director of   told Hyderabad Times, “As soon as the news broke out, we along with activists of other women’s organisations met the police officials at the Jubilee PS and registered a complaint against Chalapathi on Tuesday morning. Currently the police are discussing the case with legal experts. We are hoping that by today case will be slapped on him under IPC Section 294 for making obscene acts or words in public and under Section 354 for making sexually coloured remarks.”
 Since the actor’s comments have a sexual conation with regard to minors (pillalu), he may even face legal action under laws to protect minors from sexual offences, added the activist.
 She further said, last year also in a TV show the actor had made similar lewd comments on women.
 Responding to the actor’s apology, Satyavati, added, “We don’t want any apology from him or other offenders. Tollywood stars and politicians making vulgar comments on women should be strictly punished. We urge Telugu film fraternity to condemn the incident.
 But, she welcomed the statement made by the film’s producer  , condemning the actor.
