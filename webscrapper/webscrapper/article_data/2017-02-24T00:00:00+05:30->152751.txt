After a long break,   is back in Malayalam with the project Mudra directed by Albert. 

 The actress, who plays a Bharathanatyam dancer in the movie, is thrilled that her dancing skills are finally put to use in a movie. However, she says that training in a new dance form was quite a challenge.
 
 While she absolutely loved the dance form, performing in aramandalam almost took the life out of her, says Isha. “It almost killed me as in we have to hold ourselves in the half-sitting posture, with the knees turned sideways and the spine erect for a long time. I am trained in Kathak where you have to stand erect constantly. I trained for my dance sequences for quite a few days in Trivandrum and every time I shifted from aramandalam, my teacher would call out to me saying ‘hold the posture.’ Thanks to my amazing tutor Dr Gayathri Subramanian, I could finally do justice to my dance sequences in the movie,” she says.
 
  Isha adds, “I am glad that I have a background in dance, otherwise I don’t know how I would have done it. It’s not easy to juggle classical art forms in the first place, as they are very rigid styles with specific rules regarding every minute aspect.”
 She is, however, smitten by the beautiful costumes of Bharathanatyam.
