GURUGRAM: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday issued contempt notices to the Haryana government and additional   (school education) P K Das, for flouting its order to carry out an audit of schools in Gurgaon division.

 Justice   issued the order to assistant advocate general  , representing the state government and Das. Every year, parents complain to the Fee and   (FFRC), following which an audit takes place. However, the process was put on hold after Das had given a go-ahead to schools to hike tuition fees by putting a stay on an FFRC order in June last year.
 
 In November 2016 the high court quashed Das’ stay on audit of Gurgaon private schools by FFRC, asked authorities to restart the process within two months and submit a report.
 
 “Despite the order, government authorities failed to submit the report. Parents have been running from pillar to post demanding an audit of schools,” said Ramesh Rana, president of All India Parents Forum. 
 
 FFRC, formed under Section 158A of Haryana School Education Act, deals with fees charged by private schools. It lists a number of rules, including the schools’ duty to submit Form VI to the education department before a new session commences. 
 
 Additional chief secretary P K Das said he was not aware of the order yet, and that he would have to see it before making any official comments.
