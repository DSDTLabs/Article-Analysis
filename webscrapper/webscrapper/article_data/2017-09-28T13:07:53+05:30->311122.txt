PANAJI: Goa government on Wednesday sanctioned posts for   at the department of animal husbandry and veterinary services ( ) on contract basis in the reserved category.

 “These posts are for candidates in the reserved category but we don’t yet have qualified persons who can fill the posts,” AHVS director Dr   said.
 
 Since there is no animal husbandry college in Goa, students who wish to pursue a career in this field have to go to institutes in Mumbai or Pondicherry. Most of these students fall in the general category.
 
 Officials from the AHVS said that 18 posts in the department come under the reserved category but not a single candidate has taken up the veterinary course, so far. These are posts in the   and SC/ST category.
 
 “A degree in this five-year course needs to be accomplished to fill the posts. Even if we start sending (reserved) candidates now, it will take another five years for qualified candidates to be available for the posts,” Desai said.
 
 The AHVS has asked for de-reservation and the process for the same is ongoing.
 
 “In the meantime, we are hiring veterinary officers on contract basis in this category. We have sent our proposal for de-reservation and are waiting for it to come through.” he said.
