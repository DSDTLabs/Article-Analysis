GAYA: Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai   on Monday made the first public appearance after the Friday evening blast near his Tibetan monastery suite and recovery of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from places close to the monastery. 

 However, media persons were denied entry to the religious discourse delivered by the spiritual leader. At the same time, devotee participation in the religious discourse was much less than normal attendance in similar programmes held earlier.
 
 The impact of the blast was all too obvious. The spiritual leader entered Kalchakra Maidan, the discourse venue amid tighter security. Earlier, an additional ASP rank official was specially deputed to head the spiritual leader's personal security. The Dalai is likely to stay in   till the end of this month.
 
 Sources said post-bomb blast, foreign tourists in large numbers rescheduled their programme and made an early departure from the place. 
 
 According to tour operator AK Ojha, tourists of different nationalities have advanced their departure thereby causing heavy loss to the hospitality business in Bodh Gaya.
 
 Meanwhile, agencies involved in the investigation of the blast and recovery of IEDs were mostly engaged in behind-the-scene operations with little public apperance. The   experts have collected sample for analysis to match it with the modus operandi of different subversive groups active in the country.
 
 When contacted, Magadh police range DIG   on Monday said policemen were working on the lead provided by the CCTV footage of the area where the blast took place and the IEDs were recovered. 
 
 Asked if any arrest, detention or quizzing has taken place, the DIG replied in the negative. He did not share details of the follow-up action taken on the basis of the CCTV lead.
