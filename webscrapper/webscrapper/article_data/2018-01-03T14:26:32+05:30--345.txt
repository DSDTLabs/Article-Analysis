TRICHY: Barely a month after the highways department and the city corporation conducted eviction drives in heavily congested zones in the city, the   are back on the roads and so are the traffic congestions and snarls, questioning the very purpose of the drive.

 Concerned about frequent traffic congestion in the city, the district administration had directed both the state highways and Trichy Corporation to remove encroachments in last November. 
 
 Encroachments on   main road,   road and East Boulevard road were cleared between November 25 and December 13. However, the encroachments are now back at the same place. 
 
 “The eviction drives sustain only for a week. Hawkers and traders, after a week or so, make use of the roads to stock products and name boards which force pedestrians to walk on the roads near   and Palakkarai,” said S N Krishnakumar, a motorist on Babu Road. 
 
 Besides jeopardising the very purpose of evictions, the cost spent on heavy machinery used in each drive ranging between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 has gone to waste. Meanwhile, despite stiff opposition, even as the Trichy Corporation removed the encroachments at Marakkadai, encroachments back on the stretch since one week causing bottleneck on Madurai road.
 
 “From next week, we would do a follow up of our eviction drives on the completed stretches. As we have planned to check for encroachments once in every three months, we are confident in keeping encroachments at bay,” a highways department official said. 
 
 As a solution, social workers have suggested the constitution of an encroachment removal committee to monitor encroachments in arterial roads periodically. Similarly, soon after eviction drives if the roads are expanded, public claimed that return of encroachments would come down to an extent.
