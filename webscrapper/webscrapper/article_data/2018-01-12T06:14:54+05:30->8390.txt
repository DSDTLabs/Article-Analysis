KOLKATA: The state government has set up an inter-departmental committee, under the chairmanship of environment minister  , for a concerted effort to combat air pollution. The committee will come up with a detailed road map — short-term and long-term — to maintain ambient air.

 Kolkata has hit the headlines in recent times for being the second worst polluted city in India after Delhi. US Consulate air quality monitoring station’s report indicates that the city’s air quality is declining at an alarming rate.   Pollution Control Board, however, has disputed the relevance of one station’s report to represent the air quality of the entire city. But, environmentalists argued that the US consulate station only analyses the air quality of a place where vehicular movement is restricted. The picture will be far worse if the air quality in other regions are checked.
 
 
  
 The committee will have several sub-groups, including an air quality monitoring committee which would use the data manually collected by the PCB to understand the trend of region-specific pollution levels and adopt specific mitigation measures. Even the manual reading of the Air Quality Index (AQI) showed abnormal rise of PM10 and PM2.5 levels. While PM2.5 is finer particulate matter that directly goes to our lungs as we breath in, PM10 is coarser. In places like Behala Chowrasta, Moulali and Shyambazar, the PM10 count has seen a major hike.
 
 The committees will send periodic report to chief secretary Malay Dey with recommendations of requisite actions. “We’ve identified the broad categories of pollution and are now desperately trying to contain them,” said a senior state government officer.
