JALANDHAR: With   having disconnected   and even MC offices, AAP has promised to act against  , MC presidents and officials who erred in paying power bills if it came to power in the state.

 AAP leader   said the party was receiving reports from several villages and municipal bodies that power connections of their tube wells were being disconnected due to non-payment of electricity bills.
 
 He said paying such bills was the primary responsibility of elected heads of local bodies and officials. “This has happened because such elected heads, in connivance with officials, diverted funds meant for paying power bills. If AAP comes to power, these MC presidents and sarpanches would be disqualified from contesting elections. The officials will also face action. People cannot be denied supply of drinking water,” he said.
 
 He said PSPCL officials would also be put in the dock for having acted late in such cases.
