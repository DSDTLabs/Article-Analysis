HYDERABAD: The number of students who appeared for the agriculture, medical and allied groups saw a 12 per cent drop this year, in comparison to 2017. Reason: Lack of pharmacy jobs, fewer number of agricultural seats in   and introduction of national eligibility cum entrance test, say experts.

 
 According to the  , Hyderabad, figures, 66,858 candidates appeared for the agriculture and medical stream as against 73,496 last year.
 
 While a majority of qualified candidates seek admission to agriculture courses, Telangana is unable to meet the demand owing to a dearth of seats. “In the last few years, eight new private agriculture colleges opened in Andhra Pradesh. However, in Telangana, the number has remained constant — at 1,000 seats — with no new colleges setting shop here,” said  , senior professor at Prof   Telangana State Agricultural University, adding there is an urgent need for more public-funded agricultural institutions in Telangana.
 
 The reason for lesser number of candidates for pharmacy is rooted in lack of employment in the market, say experts. “Students of the six-year Pharm D course are demanding creation of clinical pharmacist cadre posts in state-run hospitals for the past many years. Even B Pharmacy students have been struggling to find jobs in the market,” said a faculty member at a private pharmacy college.
