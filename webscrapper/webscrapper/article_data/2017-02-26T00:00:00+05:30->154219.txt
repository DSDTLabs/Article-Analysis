 Looking at myself in the mirror and feeling good about myself.
 
 
 Extremely comfortable and safe. Even when I experiment with new styles, I keep the look simple and minimal.
 
 
 An LBD, black stilettos, red lipstick, mascara and a smile.
 
 
 My grandmother’s stunning piece of jewellery that I keep close to me as a fond memory after she passed away.

 A pair of pencil pants, blazer, high-heeled pumps and hair tied up in a messy ponytail.
 
 Jeans and a tank top.
 
 
 I am quite impulsive, I tend to pick up things quickly. Recently, I have started trying a piece of clothing, thinking over it and going back the next day to buy it, but only if I am sure it looks good on me.
 
 Love yourself – I think we do not do that enough.
 
  
 Rolling up my jeans and wearing a pair of white sneakers, and finishing the look with a high ponytail and mascara.
 
 
  
 I like the way Julia Roberts carries herself. She seems comfortable and happy in her skin.
