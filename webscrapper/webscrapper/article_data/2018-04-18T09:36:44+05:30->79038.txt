  : In a bid to tackle rising instances of crimes against women and children in the state, Meghalaya home minister   introduced in the assembly on Tuesday the   (Amendment) Bill, 2018 which proposes to create more reserved posts for women in non-gazetted ranks of the police department.

 
 "The bill proposes to increase women police personnel, in the ranks of the sub-inspector and the constable, to combat the rising instances of crimes against women and children in the state. It also lays down a reservation policy for women to these posts," the statement of objects and reasons of the bill said.
 
 The statement also pointed out that at present, the number of women in the police force, especially in the non-gazetted posts, is very few," the statement pointed out. The state's consolidated fund will not incur any additional expenditure to implement these proposals, it added.
 
 Recently, chief minister   had stated in the assembly that the police department was giving special attention to sensitize its officers and personnel to deal with crimes against women and children.
 
 "The government has taken several steps to combat crimes against women and children as well as human trafficking. We have issued directives that all these crimes should be transferred to fast-track courts. Anti-human trafficking units in all the districts and a women's helpline (181) have been set up. 'Operation Muskaan', which was initiated by the Union ministry of home affairs, is being implemented in the state to trace, rescue and rehabilitate missing children,"   had said.
