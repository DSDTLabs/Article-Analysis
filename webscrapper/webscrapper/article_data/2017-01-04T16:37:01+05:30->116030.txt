KOLKATA: Youngsters will lose interest in medicine if the draft   (Amendment) Bill comes into effect, felt teachers and senior medics in Kolkata. It was unfair to make aspiring doctors take an exit examination – as the bill proposes – for they were already overburdened with a plethora of exams, they pointed out. The focus should rather be on sharpening the   that has been going down in recent years, it was argued.

 The draft bill proposes a 50% reservation of post-graduate courses for government medical officers, apart from a combined counselling of undergraduate and postgraduate students. 
 
 "An additional exam will serve no purpose other than demoralizing students. On an average, a   takes one exam every month for four years. Then, he has to appear for a final exam, which is often followed by a series of tests to get into postgraduate courses. One more test will not produce better doctors. The stress should rather be on clinical training," said Rezaul Karim, teacher at the Sagar Datta Medical College.
 
 It would have been better had the bill suggested a uniform clinical training course for medicine students across the country. "A multiple-choice written exam will not help to select a better doctor. Development of clinical skills has remained neglected. It has, in fact, deteriorated alarmingly and this is what needs to be addressed. What the bill proposes is just the reverse. It will serve no purpose other than leaving students weary. They will now be tempted to take their college exams lightly," said  , senior professor and head of the department of breast service at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER).
