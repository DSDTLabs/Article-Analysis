KOLKATA: Three   prominently above a crowd of onlookers, close to one of the heavy iron piers. They were held aloft by three strangers, united in sadness for 27 citizens whom they had never met, but each felt they knew.

 A motely group of Kolkatans had assembled near   on Friday afternoon, exactly a year after the under-construction flyover had crashed, killing 27. They stood under the mangled remains of the flyover — even after a year, the government has not been able to take any decision on its future — mourned in silence, carrying posters and placards requesting the government to pull down the structure.
 
 Across the heavily packed road with traffic, various political outfits put up small podiums to pay respect to the crash victims. Party flags adorned the dais where political leaders from   sat with their followers and fiddled with their phones. A few metres away, members of the Burrabazar Congress Committee erected a stage and paid tribute to the victims. Long after they left, the podium continued to poach the carriageway. Close to 50 people led by former CPM MP Sudhangshu Sil took out a rally, raising slogans in favour of dismantling the remains of the flyover.
 
 “This is where the problem lies,” said  , a resident of Kali Krishna Tagore Street who participated in the condolence meet organised by some local residents. “Even grief has been politicised now. Every party is trying to appropriate our pain and sadness,” said Rastogi.
 
 Many residents returned without even participating in the condolence meeting after they saw politicians all over the place. “Close to 50 residents including women and children had come down to participate and bring out a candle-light march in memory of those who died. But when we saw so many politicians, we decided to cancel our plans. We do not want any trouble,” said  , who stays in the building adjacent to Ganesh Talkies in Posta.
