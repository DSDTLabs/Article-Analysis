KOLKATA: SitiCable officials on Wednesday claimed that its 35 lakh subscribers across the state have opted for just 1.4 Star channel per connection on an a la carte basis since January 1. The four most widely subscribed channels were Star Jalsha,  , Star Plus and  , but their numbers were not significant enough to revert to a fixed-fee agreement with the broadcaster that was called off a month ago.

 Star channels were beamed into 12 lakh SitiCable subscriber homes in Kolkata as part of packages till December 31. “Since we started offering them a la carte, 74% have opted for Star Jalsha, which is by far the most popular Star channel. But just 45% have chosen Star Jalsha Movies and 14% have opted for Star Plus. A mere 5% have opted for the Star Sports channels. This shows that the numbers are not big enough for the channels to be included in packages. We will continue to offer the channels a la carte,” said   of SitiCable. Star India did not respond to TOI’s calls.
 
 Less than 1% of SitiCable subscribers, according to Sethia, have opted for the other Star channels. “It makes no sense to burden subscribers with all 64 Star channels which don’t have a large enough viewership. Barring Star Jalsha, the rest have alimited following in this part of the country. Some have opted for Star Jalsha Movies largely because it is telecasting the ISL football matches,” he said.
 
 There is, however, a considerable discontent among SitiCable subscribers since they are set to miss out on a number of sporting events lined up in the coming weeks, including ISL matches, English Premier League and Bundesliga, apart from the ongoing   U-19 Cricket World Cup, the final of which will be played this Saturday. Star Sports is also set to telecast the   matches from April.
 
 SitiCable, however, has made it clear it will not continue with the fixed-fee agreement with Star India if the broadcaster insists on a 110% fee hike.
