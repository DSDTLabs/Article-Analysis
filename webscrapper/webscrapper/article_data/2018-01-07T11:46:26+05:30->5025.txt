SALEM:   governor   on Saturday nominated P Kolandaivel, an assistant professor at Bharathiyar University in Coimbatore, as the new vice-chancellor of Periyar University. Kolandaivel will be the VC for three years, a press release said.

 The post was vacant from July 2017 when former VC C   completed his term. Political parties, including Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), had raised allegations against the VC selection committee set up to find a replacement. Alleging that the selection committee had listed corrupt candidates for the post,   MP Anbumani Ramadoss had urged the state government to constitute a new committee for VC selection. Anbumani also urged the governor to nominate a steadfast academician to the post.
