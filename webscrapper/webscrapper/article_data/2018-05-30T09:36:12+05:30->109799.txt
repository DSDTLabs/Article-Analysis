CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Directorate of Government Examinations on Wednesday announced the results of the first ever class XI board exams conducted this year. An overall pass percentage of 91.3% was recorded. 

 Nearly 8.63 lakh students appeared for exam that was held in March-April this year. 
 
 Continuing the trend across classes, girls with 94.6% overtake boys at 87.4%. More than 29% (biggest chunk of students) in range of 200-300 marks while the smallest of 4.29% have scored above 500 marks (the highest bracket).
 
 
 
 
 The highest pass percentage of 97.28% was recorded in Erode which was followed by Tiruppur district with 96.40% and Coimbatore with 96.19%.
 
 The 11th board exam was introduced by the school education department for the first time this year as many schools in the state were earlier not following the 11th syllabus fully and were giving importance to 12th standard portions even during 11th classes in order to achieve high results in the 12th exams. 
 
 In the backdrop of NEET, the department felt that both higher secondary class portions were required to equip students to crack competitive exams and to prevent schools from skipping the 11th portions, brought in the board exams this year.
