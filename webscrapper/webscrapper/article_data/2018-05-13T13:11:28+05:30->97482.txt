Singer   is going to be a father soon. I remember him professing his love to GF   on air during the first season of  , which he eventually won. The marriage was met with a bit of opposition from Debaleena’s family as Aneek is into showbiz, not the most coveted profession for a   groom. But finally love won over social customs and I’m really happy about that.
