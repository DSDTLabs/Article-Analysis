Nagpur: Following the Gorakhpur hospital tragedy, the state government is taking special vigilance to improve neonatal health care system. In last seven days, the government has invested over Rs 56 crore in Vidarbha. Places like Melghat and Gadchiroli where the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is relatively high, are being prioritized. The grants are being released under the 13th finance commission and are being sanctioned by state public health department with an aim to reduce IMR. According to one of the recent RTI, the IMR (deaths per 1000 births) at Melghat — recorded in the years 2012-13 is 42, 2013-14 is 37, 2014-15 is 41, 2015-16 is 43. While in 2016-17, the IMR has shown a dramatic rise at 58. On the other hand at Gadchiroli, the situation is not that worse but if is compared with IMR of the state, a lot needs to be improved. As per the district health official, the IMR at Gadchiroli was 35 till the year 2014-15 and since then the IMR has been 30. The official said, “Presently, the IMR of state is 11. The IMR of the district has been bought down with time but if we compare it with state we are still three times ahead.” The works being initiated by state government are bringing positive hope at both the districts. A total of Rs 14.20 crore has been invested to establish a Sick Neonatal Care Unit (SNCU) and upgrade labour room of 96 health buildings run by health department. Of the total funds, Rs 1.05 crore will be used to set up NICU at either Melghat or Gadchiroli. To make the rural hospitals and sub district hospital perform safe C-section delivery, the labour rooms are being upgraded at par with operation theatre (OT). Rest of the funds will be used for civil works to prepare delivery room and recovery room at Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs). Further, to cater the increasing demand of vaccines, a state vaccine store will be constructed at either Melghat or Gadchiroli — consisting of Walk-In Cold Rooms (WICs) and Walk-In Freezer Rooms (WIFs). In the same run, more repair works are being taken at 49 department run health buildings at Melghat and 26 at Gadchiroli. The vaccine store construction and repair works will be done at Rs 38.12 crore. Very recently, under the same scheme, funds of Rs 1.09 crore and Rs 1.35 crore have been sanctioned to construct SNCU at Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College, Yavatmal and at Achalpur (Amravati District) respectively.
