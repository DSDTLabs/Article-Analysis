HYDERABAD: Senior Telangana TDP leader and firebrand politburo member   on Friday dared party national president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu   to take action against him if the latter thinks he has indulged in anti-party activities.

 
 “I will rub my nose on the floor of Naidu’s house if I am at fault,” he said at a press conference at his residence here. “Naidu trusted Revanth Reddy and did not take action against him when he met   to join  . While no action was taken against leaders like Revanth, why am I being targeted? Is it because I am a Dalit and do not have huge money like Revanth,” he asked.
 
 “A situation is being created in the party to force me out of the party,” he said. When asked if he would be joining the ruling TRS, Narsimhulu said: “Time will decide everything..I still stand by my earlier statement that KCR is our good friend and that TDP should go with TRS or merge with it in Telangana.”
 
 He praised KCR for honouring Dalits by giving them   seats. “Naidu is not even willing to meet me. I was not even invited to the Mahanadu in the city. Had Naidu given me an appointment, this press conference would not have been held to pour my heart out,” he added.
