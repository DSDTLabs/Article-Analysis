BENGALURU: The top cop’s idea to enable callers to fix appointments with police officials hasn’t fetched the desired response — no one has used the facility for nearly two months now. 

 In the first week of June, chief minister Siddaramaiah had inaugurated the modernized police   with multiple services. The number 100 was IVRS enabled and provided callers the option of fixing appointments with senior police officials, especially station house officers (SHO).
 
 “Those seeking appointments with SHOs or inspectors should   and select option 3. But not a single caller has availed of the facility,” said police commissioner Praveen Sood.
 
 He said the idea was to make it easier for citizens when they visit police stations for verification or other purposes. “Often, senior citizens and women are forced to spend long hours inside police stations to get their work done. People may not be comfortable sitting and waiting at police stations. Instead, they can schedule an appointment with SHOs, drop by at the police station at the specified time and get the job done,” he explained.
 
 6.5k calls a day
 
 The police control room receives about 6,500 calls per day. “The number of calls has increased after the control room was upgraded with 100 lines. Of these 6,500 calls, 4,000 are to do with law and order issues, while 1,000 are related to traffic,” a source said.
