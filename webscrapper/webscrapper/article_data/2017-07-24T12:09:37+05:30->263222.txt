BAREILLY: Expressing disappointment over "no change" in the prices of food grains and pulses in the retail market, the   government has instructed district magistrates to get tough on traders who are not passing the benefits of the Goods and   (GST) to the consumers. The Centre has exempted cereals, pulses, atta, maida and besan from the  , which was rolled out from July 1, claiming that these items would get cheaper by up to 5%; however, noticing no change in the prices of some of these items, the state government in a letter to the directorate of agro marketing and agro foreign trade stated that instead of getting cheaper, these items were being sold on older prices. 

  According to data for the second week of July available with the state government, the prices of all edible items, except a few, have been fallen. Wheat, rice, maze, barley, gram, lentil, moong and urad dal, onion, apple and banana have become cheaper after the GST implementation, it says. 
 
  Agro marketing director Dhiraj Kumar said, "It is observed that the prices of 17 agro products have fallen to the tunes of Rs 9 to Rs 374 per quintal after July 1, but there is no visible change in the prices of these items in the retail market. It is very unfortunate that traders are not passing the benefit of GST to the consumers." 
 
  Bareilly DM R V Singh, meanwhile, instructed the district supply officer ( ) and deputy director of mandi to hold meetings with stockists and retailers to sensitise them about positive aspects of the GST and convince them to pass the benefit of the new tax regime to the consumers. 
 
  Meanwhile, ADM (enforcement) S P Singh told TOI, "DSO and deputy director of mandi have been instructed to check the prices in the retail market and send their reports on Monday."
