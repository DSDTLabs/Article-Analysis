PATIALA: A day after police confirmed that dreaded gangster   and two of his associates were shot down in an encounter in Rajasthan, state security agencies remained on an alert as a preventive measure on Sunday.

 The state prisons department issued an advisory to all jails in where gangsters are lodged to keep a close watch on their activities. A flag march was taken out at   central jail, where around 17 gangsters, directly or indirectly involved in Nabha jailbreak, are lodged. According to sources in police, the vigil was up across the state, especially in view of the threat given by sympathisers of gangsters on social media. The sympathisers had warned of killing six policemen to avenge the killings of Vicky Gounder and his two accomplices.
 
 In the threat, the sympathisers had claimed: “Whatever happened today is unfortunate. Vicky will continue to live in our hearts. We had warned you to take proper action. We had already told you that you will kill one then we will kill two. Now, six of your men will die. We will let you know how someone’s son is killed. We will surely avenge Vicky’s death (sic).” The message further threatened the cops: “When your own will die, only then you will realise. You did your job, now it is our turn.” 
 
 The page on social media on which the threat was issued was removed on Sunday. However, various other pages that are also maintained in the name of Vicky Gounder and his associates, including  , continued to be flooded with messages expressing grief over the deaths and anger against police. 
 
 His sympathisers uploaded the videos of his last rites being performed at his native village, attracting hundreds of condolence messages. While police department maintained it was a routine exercise to put up check posts to maintain law and order, it was learnt that specific directions had been issued to the district police forces of Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Jalandhar, Gurdaspur and Amritsar districts to heighten vigil.
