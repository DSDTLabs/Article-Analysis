NEW DELHI:  , leader of opposition in Delhi assembly, filed a complaint at Parliament Street police station against an alleged AAP activist, Dalip Kumar, for threatening him with physical assault. Gupta claimed that Kumar, who claimed to be an AAP activist, threatened him while replying to his tweet. 

 In a tweet on Friday, Gupta had claimed that ever since the Arvind Kejriwal-led government came to power, it had been trying to silence his voice — be it in the assembly, through assault by MLAs or marshals, or, more recently, on January 30 at the CM’s residence.
 
 Reacting to the alleged threat, Gupta said: “In view of the surcharged political atmosphere prevailing in Delhi for last four days, it is not possible that a political activist will issue such an open threat to the leader of the opposition without the consent of ruling party's leadership. Hence, it can be logically concluded that the threat by the activist has the AAP leadership’s consent.”.
 
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari condemned the alleged threat. Echoing Gupta’s views, he said: “In the current volatile circumstances, this threat by an AAP activist to a senior leader of opposition could not be made without the consent of AAP leadership. This should also be seen in addition to a reported statement made by MLA Naresh Balyan today that officials should be assaulted if they object to MLAs proposals (sic).”
 
 He claimed that AAP’s “anarchy and naxalism” had reached its peak and people would soon throw the government out. He demanded the immediate arrest of Kumar Balyan for inciting violence.
