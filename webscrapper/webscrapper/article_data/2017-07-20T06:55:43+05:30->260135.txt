LUCKNOW: As if narrowing of lanes to facilitate Lucknow   construction was not enough, commuters face inconvenience also because of heavyset machines and trucks loaded with building material which take up more than half the space on Faizabad Road, Station Road and MG Marg.   gets jammed frequently because of cement-concrete mixers, cranes, trucks carrying water,   material, etc occupying the half the roadâ€™s width. 

 On Thursday afternoon, traffic from Mahanagar taking the Badshahnagar U-turn to reach Nishatganj flyover was stuck for almost an hour because of a cement mixing truck coming from the opposite side. The vehicle took up almost half of the limited space on the road and blocked movement of cars, autorickshaws and bikes that were carrying mostly children returning from school. 
 
 Similar problem is faced by commuters on Faizabad Road near HAL and Lekhraj Market up to Polytechnic Crossing because of metro construction activity. The problem worsens near diversions when construction vehicles and equipment   traffic for long durations. Though   has improved Badshahnagar plan of late by widening roads, removing encroachments, shifting bus stoppage etc, the good efforts are nullified by random parking of these construction vehicles along construction site. 
 
 Though Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation barricades one side of the road at night to allow movement of heavy vehicles on Secretariat and MG Marg, it continues to block the traffic all day. The routes where metro corridor is proposed comprises one of the busiest routes in the city and any extra obstruction leads to a jam.
