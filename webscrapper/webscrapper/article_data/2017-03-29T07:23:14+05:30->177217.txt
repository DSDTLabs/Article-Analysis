VADODARA: Since long it has been said that the city needs to monitor its chemical and petrochemical units in wake of the threats they pose to environment and even life. 

 While the scale of the smell may be large on Monday, residents in some areas of the city have been facing the issue since quite some time. A case in point is that of a posh apartment scheme in Gorwa whose residents have been making frequent complaints regarding gas leakage to the   (GPCB).
 
 Environment activist   said that Vadodara is potentially air pollution threatened city. “Air pollution disaster can take place in Vadodara because of its location and industries around it,” he said, terming Monday as complete failure of disaster management authority.
 
 “Even in 2001-02, a similar panic had spread in the city. A lot of industries dump their effluent into the drainage system which travels into several areas of the city. Secondly, the storm water drains in the city have been partially covered. There is a high possibility that some industry must have dumped its effluent in the drainage system which might have resulted in the stench,” said Prajapati.
 
 “You need air monitoring stations which can reflect the air quality of Vadodara city in general. Secondly, there should be industry specific air monitoring stations keeping in mind industries inside and around Vadodara city. There is need of mobile air monitoring system which should be available handy with the pollution control board,” he said.
