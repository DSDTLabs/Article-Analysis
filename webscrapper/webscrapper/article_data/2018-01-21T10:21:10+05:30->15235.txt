Three key functionaries (sah-karyavahs) Bhaiyaji Joshi, Dattatreya Hosabole and Krishna Gopal will also be present at the mega Sangh congregation being organised before three northeastern states -Meghalaya, Tripura and Nagaland- go to polls next month. Tripura will vote on February 18, followed by Meghalya and Nagaland on February 27. The event on the banks of the Brahmaputra is dedicated to the river, which is known as Luit in Assam. "Fifteen hundred tribal and Dalit families have offered to provide food for the workers. Volunteers will be collecting the food from door to door," said RSS functionary from Assam, Naba Bujarbaruah, who is one of the key organisers of the event. 
 
 The RSS meet will be significant for BJP which has been striving to expand its footprint in the northeast region, especially after coming to power in Assam, its first government in the region. Although RSS maintains its apolitical stance, its cadres can galvanise the saffron party and help it consolidate its position in the region. The RSS has consistently worked in Assam and other northeastern states even after the killing of dozens of its Pracharaks and workers like Pramod Dikshit, Muralidharan and Shukleshwar Medhi. 
 
 "The Sangh effectively ignored and bypassed aggressive regionalism and unbelievable hate propaganda and established itself in mainstream society in the northeast," said Sangh functionary Vinay Joshi.
