Nagpur: The Nandanvan police on Tuesday booked 25-year-old Dolly Uike for abetting suicide for her beau Vikas Kakde (35).

 The cops took the action after receiving a suicide from the deceased’s brother, Pandurang (38), who lodged a complaint against the woman.
 
 It is learnt that Kakde, who was a graduate, was unemployed which led Dolly to take a decision for a better future. Accordingly, she decided to step out the relationship.
 
 Kakde, who was allegedly addicted to alcohol, couldn’t handle the situation and hanged himself from the ceiling fan with a veil at his place in Darshan Colony on June 11, the same day Dolly got married to other man.
 
 Police said Kakde mentioned in his last letter that Dolly betrayed him and married some other person. “She compelled me to take the drastic step. I sought strict action against her deeds,” he wrote in the letter.
 
 Kakde and Dolly, who stayed in the neighborhood, were in relationship for four years. However, things turned sour when she started ignoring him following his attitude.
