COIMBATORE: Antony, an auto driver at Sivananda Colony, was surprised when VS   Kumar, a social worker, gave him books on Tamil sage poet Thiruvalluvar on Wednesday morning.

 “I will definitely read them as I get a lot of free time between the rides,” Antony said.
 
 Suresh Kumar said that he was on a mission to educate auto drivers. “People often complain about the way auto drivers behave and how they break traffic rules. But we do nothing about it. So, I decided that I will educate them and ensure that they use their time wisely. They meet a lot of strangers every day. But,  ,  ,” Suresh told TOI.
 
 As many as 15 auto drivers at Sivananda Colony received books on Thiruvalluvar. Notebooks, stationery such as pens, pencils were also given to them.
 
 “I told them to pen down their thoughts every day. They observe several things and I wanted them to express themselves. It will help them educate others as well,” said Suresh. 
 
 The auto drivers said that they will ensure that at least their children are educated. “We will read these books and share the knowledge with our family as well,” said an auto driver.
 
 Antony said that it was a really good initiative. “All auto drivers in the city should be given this insight. This will really help us. Many of us couldn’t get educated due to financial constraints. But this initiative has proven that we can get educated anytime,” he said.
 
 The drivers were also informed about traffic rules and how some of their violations could prove fatal. “I will continue this initiative in all the auto stands across the city in the coming days,” added Suresh, who is also a member of the Rotary Club of Coimbatore Green City.
