RAJKOT: A 21-year-old woman hospitalised with stab wounds was forced to make a false gangrape complaint against three persons allegedly by her husband on Wednesday morning. However, during questioning the woman told the police that she was stabbed by her husband as he suspected her of having an affair. 
 
 Following the statement by Santok Rana (21), a resident of Vishwanagar RMC quarters on Morbi Road in Rajkot, her husband Prakash Rana was booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) 326 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 498 (subjecting woman to cruelty). 
  
 Santok was rushed to hospital early Wednesday morning with stab wounds where she accused her landlord   and his associates — Mahesh Rathod and Ajit Rathod — of gang-raping her at knifepoint on the nights of Monday and Tuesday. She also alleged that the trio had stabbed her after the crime. 
  
 However, when Malaviyanagar police officials interrogated Santok’s husband they found discrepancy in statement. “On finding contradiction in statements of husband and wife, we decided to quiz Santok at  . She said she was stabbed by Prakash who forced her to lodge a false rape complaint against Kamlesh, Mahesh and Ajit. Prakash suspected her of indulging an affair,” said a cop.
