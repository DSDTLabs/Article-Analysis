NOIDA: High electricity tariff in builder apartments was one of the major issues raised by consumers at a meeting held by the Noida power department under PVVNL, Meerut division, in the city on Friday. Consumers in high-rises also demanded individual power connections and the need for a few transformers to increase load capacity.

 The public hearing by the Noida power department was held at   in Sector 6 and aimed at addressing all issues relating to consumer redress, such as billing, new connections, load increase/upgrade, meters, voltage fluctuations and so on.
 
 “A majority of the complaints were related to builder connections at higher rates as four to five RWAs as well as residents from high-rise societies broached the topic. We are aware of the issue as the Vidyut Lokpal had said that the matter is being looked into by the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission. A decision is expected in a month’s time,” said Rakesh Kumar Rana, the superintending engineer of PVVNL.
 
 Earlier this month, TOI had reported that UPERC is currently deliberating on a module to provide direct power connections in housing societies and that which will be acceptable to the builder, consumer and the regulatory discom/power department.
