NEW DELHI: Students of Delhi University are   about a notification issued by the   in October, which states that only fifth and sixth semester students will be allowed to sit for supplementary exams after their regular tests. 

 First and second year students won’t get this option, which means they will need to come back to take the supplementary exams after completing their third year. Students say this is “discriminatory”, as many may not get their degrees on time.
 
 The three-year LL.B course consists of six semesters: two in each year. In each semester, there are five papers. For promotion to second year, it is incumbent for a student to clear at least five out of the 10 papers. Likewise, for promotion to third year, it is mandatory to clear 15 out of 20 papers.
 
 Earlier, rules stated that students must clear eight and 18 papers in first and second year, respectively.
 
 “Students had to clear so many papers and, at times, also their supplementary exams. It was because of that this new system was introduced on the basis of the recommendation of a committee headed by Justice VS Deshpande in 1989,” Ved Kumari, dean of the law faculty, said.
 
 Students claim that the   was released only a few days before the exam, which, they say, is another instance of the dean’s “autocratic” functioning, a charge denied by Kumari. She said such decisions were taken by a faculty of law committee, “which includes five members outside the faculty, including an SC and an HC judge”.
 
 Kumari cited a response by HC to a petition by a law faculty student in 2011, which had said that Justice VS Deshpande Committee had stated that no student should be allowed to carry over the load of more than one semester to the next semester. “This helps in quicker evaluation of papers and enrolment of students for further studies,” Kumari said.
