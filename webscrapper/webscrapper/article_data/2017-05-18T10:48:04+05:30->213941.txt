MUMBAI: Sri Lanka pace great Chaminda   believes that the India's star-studded batting line-up, led by India skipper  , will sparkle in the upcoming   beginning in England from June 1.

 "These guys (the bowlers) are really good, but how they assess the conditions in England (will be crucial). India has talent, combinations, different bowling attack (variety) swing, seam, but I am sure that they will use their experience and they will do well.
 
 More than bowling the batters (batsmen) in the Indian side will do well in the Champions Trophy," Vaas, in the city to coach selected players of the   T20 league, said here on Wednesday. India start their campaign against arch-rivals against Pakistan on June 4.
 
 Once a side full of big names, Sri Lanka are currently in a rebuilding phase, and Vaas, who's currently the bowling consultant of the team and will join it in England after his week-long coaching stint is over here, hoped that the islanders will perform well in the multination tournament.
 
 "Sri Lanka after Mahela ( ) and Kumara ( ) are in a transition (phase). They are trying to build a team and whoever is in the team will give 100 per cent and try and do well (in the Champions Trophy)," he said.
