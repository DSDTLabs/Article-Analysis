MUMBAI: BJP MP Kirit Somaiya has yet again trained guns on the   on the corruption issue ahead of the civic elections.

 A day after the Sena announced that it was ending its alliance with the BJP for the civic polls across the state, Somaiya said he would come out with a ‘black paper’ on graft and malpractices in the BMC. This is the BJP’s first salvo against the Sena as the poll campaign gets going.
 
 “The black paper, which will cite details of the cases of corruption in the Mumbai civic corporation, will be made public next week,” Somaiya told a channel on Friday. A wide section of Shiv Sainiks have been upset with Somaiya for putting the entire blame for corruption in the BMC at the Sena's doorstep. The Sena is of the view that as its ally, the BJP too should accept a portion of the blame. Somaiya’s onslaught on the Sena , which has come hot on the heels of the latter announcing the end of its alliance with the BJP for the upcoming elections in the state, is a clear indication that the BJP was all set to take on Matoshree in the days to come, said observers.
