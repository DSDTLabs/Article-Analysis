Coimbatore: The public   constructed using the Swachh Bharat Mission fund near the   Town   became free-to-use after TOI reported about the contractor fleecing its users. Stickers have been stuck on the facility, announcing its free status.

 The toilet was constructed at a cost of about Rs 42lakh, which was sanctioned by the Central government and using donations by the corporates in the city. It was meant to be a free-to-use facility since it was opened last April. But, Vardhan Infrastructure Civil Engineers and Contractors was charging Rs 5 from users. 
 
 A back-of-the-envelope calculation revealed that the contractor was pocketing Rs 3 lakh per month since last April. Representatives of the company had told TOI that they charged the public to maintain the toilet, even as the city corporation provided free water and electricity to maintain it. The contractor had also received permission from the district collector and the corporation commissioner to set up advertisement boards to earn revenue from it. That revenue, as per tender norms, was supposed to be used to maintain the facility.
 
 Corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan said that he had already called for an inquiry into the matter. “We will issue show cause notices to the contractor, asking why action should not be initiated against them,” he said.
