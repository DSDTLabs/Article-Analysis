AHMEDABAD:   on Tuesday reserved its order till Thursday on a PIL demanding proper implementation of the Right to Education (RTE) Act in more transparent manner so that poor students get benefit in securing fee admissions in private schools.

 A student studying at the   (GFSU)   filed the PIL seeking directions to the government to place all details related to number of seats, names of schools etc on website. He complained that revelation of incomplete details on public domain has led to a situation in which nearly 65,000 poor kids missed admission in Class 1 in 2017-18.
 
 The state government, on the other hand, insisted that the state government has been implementing the law in phased manner. The decision for targeted implementation was taken after states like   and Tamilnadu failed to implement the law when they tried to implement it 100% from the first year when the law came into effect.
 
 Government pleader   informed the court that the state government has placed proper system of verification at every level so that private schools cannot get away with false information. She submitted that the governmentâ€™s target is to ensure over 1 lakh admission in Class 1 under RTE laws.
