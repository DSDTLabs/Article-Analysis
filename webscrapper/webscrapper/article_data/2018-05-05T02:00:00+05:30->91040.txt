PATNA:   (NOU) has been tasked with conducting the maiden state-level combined entrance test for admission to the state’s 321 BEd colleges for the session 2018-20.

 NOU registrar S P Sinha said the schedule, including the dates for submission of applications and examinations, would be submitted to the chancellor’s office within a day or two. 
 
 NOU will develop a common web portal for the candidates to apply for the admission test. “The university aims to complete the examination in July,” Sinha said and added the university received a letter from the Raj Bhawan on Friday, asking it to conduct the examination.
 
 Sources said the state-level combined entrance test would be conducted by universities in rotation.
 
 According to a Raj Bhawan notice, the admission test will carry 120 marks, including 15 marks from general English comprehension, 15 from Hindi, 25 from reasoning, 40 from general awareness and 40 from learning-teaching environment in schools. The students will have to give answers to the multiple-choice questions on OMR sheet.
 
 The application fees will be Rs 1,000 for general candidates, Rs 750 for OBC, EBC, women and handicapped candidates and Rs 500 for SC and ST candidates.
 
 A decision to hold state-level combined entrance test for BEd admissions was taken at a meeting of university VCs held at Raj Bhawan under the chairmanship of governor-cum-chancellor Satya Pal Malik on February 14. Subsequently, a three-member committee consisting of VCs of different universities was constituted to decide the modalities of the entrance test. 
 
 The committee has reportedly submitted its report to the Raj Bhawan. A team of officials of Raj Bhawan and the universities also visited neighbouring UP to procure details of such an entrance test.
 
 Last year, BEd admissions were made on the basis of combined entrance test, albeit at the university level and not at the state level.
