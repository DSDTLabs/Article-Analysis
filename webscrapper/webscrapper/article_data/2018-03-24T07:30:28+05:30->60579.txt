AMARAVATI:   chief minister and TDP president   on Friday turned down Union finance minister Arun Jaitley’s offer for talks in order to arrive at a consensus on the twin issues of giving special category status and allocation of central funds to the state.

 “There is no need to meet any Union minister at this point. If they come face to face, just greet them and go on. Let us have healthy relations with everyone, but continue to fight for our state’s causes,” Naidu told TDP MPs during a teleconference on Friday morning.
 
 On March 16, TDP, which has 16 MPs, quit the BJP-led NDA government, days after two of its MPs had left the Union cabinet.
 
 During the teleconference, former Union minister and party MP YS Chowdhary told Naidu that Jaitley invited him for talks to end the stalemate over “poor budgetary allocation” for the state, sources said. Jaitley told Chowdhary that the NDA government wanted to keep its promises to Andhra, but didn’t mention anything about the special category status — a demand on which the allies parted ways — to the state, sources said.
 
 Andhra finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said meeting any BJP minister at this point would send wrong signals to people of the state.
 
 “Let the NDA government respond on its own and tell people of Andhra Pradesh what it wants to give to the state,” Ramakrishnudu said.
 
 Naidu seconded his opinion and told his MPs that they should stay away from BJP ministers and that there was no point in talking to them at this juncture.
