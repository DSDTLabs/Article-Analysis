 But Smriti had a problem with the title of the event,  . “My question is, ‘What is wrong with womanhood that you need to redefine it? What is lacking in womanhood that we need to add new adjectives to it? The very fact that we are women and we have come together to celebrate these achievements not only of women but also of men symbolises that we as a gender encompass celebration of excellence irrespective of gender and that is what define us,” she added.
