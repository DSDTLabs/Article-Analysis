KERI: Every year, just a day before Holi Pournima, devotees from Sanguem, Dharbandora and   throng Diggi, a locale in Karnataka’s Uttar Kannada district, to partake in a fair held at the temple of Gavaladevi. 
 
 This tradition, which has been kept alive since the pre-British era, assumes historical and cultural significance as the temple was situated on what was once considered a gateway between Goa and  . Although the gateway, which ran along the Diggi Ghats, was used chiefly for salt trade between Goa and Supa before 1858, it was also the route that many devotees from Goa took to get to the temple of Gavaladevi. 
  
 Suresh Bhandari, a resident of Uguem, Sanguem, which is situated at the foothill of the ghats says, “Every year, devotees from Sanguem and its surrounding areas brave a perilous route that winds through thick forests just to get to the temple of Gavaladevi and seek the deity’s blessings.” 
  
 In fact, it was largely because of monetary contributions by the faithful from Goa that the temple, situated in a densely forested area in Diggi, was refurbished a decade ago. 
  
 The temple, interestingly, has one of the area’s biggest anthills in its sanctum sanctorum, and its sacred tank is known to have perennial sources of water. Villagers from Diggi, Bondeli, Kanne, Mayare, Soliye, Kindale and Metkun consider Gavaladevi to be their presiding deity, even as they worship several other folk deities that are set in stone in the vicinity of the temple.
