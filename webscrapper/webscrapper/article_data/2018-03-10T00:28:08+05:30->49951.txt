Indore: The   aspirants, who have raised   on answer keys released by Madhya Pradesh Public Services Commission (MPPSC) for preliminary examination, have a reason to cheer. The   has decided to   the amount charged by candidates on each objection found valid.

 A number of candidates, who had appeared for the preliminary exam held on February 18 for various positions, alleged that a total of 15 answer keys were wrong. 
 
 The candidates were upset about the provision of MPPSC charging Rs100 per objection. “We had to pay for wrong answers. Besides, there is a portal charge. This is objectionable,” said an aspirant. 
 
 With the questions being raised by hundreds of aspirants and experts from the state, the board has changed its policy. 
 
 “If a candidate’s objection is found valid then the   charged will be refunded to him. An expert panel for different subjects is checking the objections and we are working towards announcing the results as early as possible,” said MPPSC secretary Pawan Kumar Sharma,
 
 The board had received objections till March 3. The officials said that MPPSC has received a total of 849 objections. Of them, 750 are for general awareness question paper and 99 for the second paper. 
 
 Preliminary exam for several positions in the state government was held on February 18 and the model answer key was published on the commission’s portal four days later on February 21. 
 
 The candidates were given a week to challenge the answer keys. Model answer keys meant to bring in transparency in multiple choice question-based examinations have instead led to confusion among examinees.
 
 The aspirants in the city are highly disappointed with negligence of the authorities. The coaching experts from the city said release of incorrect answer keys is a mockery of the examination system.
