 SHRC member D Jayachandran also directed the government to recover the amount from the sub-inspector, Govindaraj.
 
 This apart, the state has also been directed to give suitable instructions to the director general of police, Tamil Nadu and all commissioners of police, to instruct their subordinate officials to ensure strict compliance of guidelines set by the Supreme Court in D K Basu case while arresting an accused.
 
 The commission passed the orders on a complaint filed by V Nandamani, a resident of Kolapakkam, who is working as a quality supervisor in a pharmaceutical company at Bengaluru.
 
 According to Nandamani, on October 10, 2010 he visited his relative Venkatesan at his house in Unamancheri. As they were chatting in front of Venkatesanâ€™s house, at about 8pm, Govindaraj came there along with a few other police personnel and attempted to arrest Venkatesan.
 
 As the neighbours opposed the arrest, Govindaraj immediately contacted Otteri police station, from where personnel reached the spot in a van and arrested both Venkatesan and Nandamani. Later, Nandamani was held in the police station without any justification and tortured, and finally remanded to judicial   for eight days, the complainant alleged.
 
 The police however, claimed that the duo was arrested based on a complaint lodged by Ganesan, stating that they assaulted him and furnished details of their arrest and remand. 
 
 After perusing the documents produced in support of the claims made by both the parties, the commission concluded that the complainant was subject to human rights violation and directed the government to pay the compensation within four weeks.
