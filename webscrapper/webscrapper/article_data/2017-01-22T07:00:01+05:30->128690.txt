LUCKNOW: Senior Samajwadi Party leader Ambika Chaudhary by joining the rival BSP camp on Saturday opened Pandora’s box with clear signs that the old guard within the party is jittery about its political future. 

 At the same time, political analysts see it as a sign of changing times. With 44-year-old Akhilesh Yadav at the helm of the affairs as SP national president, the party is now looking at a makeover which has a younger and thus more appealing identity to resonate better among the sizeable young voters, they say.
 
 However, veterans in SP insist that the new order in the party has left little room for the old timers, most of whom had stood with party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav for decades. It was perhaps this sentiment that prompted Ambika to express solidarity with the SP founder when he said on Saturday that the way Akhilesh Yadav treated Mulayam during the recent family feud was painful.
 
 Senior SP leader and Mulayam aide Beni Prasad Verma, a founding member of the party, has been unhappy over the manner in which his son Rakesh has been sidelined by the new guard. Rakesh has been denied a ticket from Ramnagar in Barabanki and has been replaced by Akhilesh loyalist and sitting MLA Arvind Singh Gope. Sources close to Beni said the veteran politician is so upset that he was now planning to field his son as an independent candidate.
 
 Similar sentiments were aired by Mulayam aides and loyalists Rakesh Yadav and former MP from Sambhal Shafiqur Rahman Barq. The party has denied a ticket to Rakesh Yadav’s son Ashish, a sitting MLA from Etah. Appointed as the chairman of   reportedly owing to his proximity with Mulayam, Rakesh is disappointed with the party’s decision to drop his son who has now resigned from the party. Barq was so annoyed by the SP leadership after being denied a ticket for his grandson Zia-Ul-Haq, that the two have joined AIMIM.
