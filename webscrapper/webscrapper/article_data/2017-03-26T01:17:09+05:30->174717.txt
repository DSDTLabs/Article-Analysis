NEW DELHI: The European drug regulator has recommended suspension of around 300 medicines on which   were conducted by Chennai-based  , citing unreliability of data. Bioequivalence studies are usually the basis for approval of generic medicines. 

 The   (EMA) said that the suspension has been ordered for all   for which the bioequivalence studies were conducted by Micro Therapeutic Research Labs at two sites in India. “The review, by EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), concluded that data from studies conducted at the (two) sites between June 2012 and June 2016 are unreliable and cannot be accepted as a basis for marketing authorisation in the EU,” EMA said in a statement. It, however, said there is no evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness of medicines authorised and being evaluated in the EU on the basis of studies at the sites. 
 
 Aurobindo Pharma, Zydus, Sandoz, Sanofi and Mylan are among the major pharmaceutical firms that will be affected by the suspension. “The CHMP’s recommendation concerning these medicines will now be sent to the European Commission for a legally binding decision valid throughout the EU,” EMA said. 
 
 The regulator, however, said that some of the medicines which have been recommended for suspension may be of critical importance in certain EU member states. Therefore, national authorities can temporarily postpone the suspension in the interest of patients.
