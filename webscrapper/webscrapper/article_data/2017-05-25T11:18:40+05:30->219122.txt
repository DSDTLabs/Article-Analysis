PANAJI: It's a question of time. And none of the key players in the organizing of the 36th National Games to be hosted by Goa have an answer.

 The Games were scheduled to be held in November. But a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the event after Chief Minister   revealed during the budget session at the legislative assembly in March that the Games would be put back to next year. The   (GOA),   (SAG) and the Indian Olympic Association ( ) now don't seem to have the foggiest notion when the oft-postponed Games will be held after the CM's statement.
 
 The IOA, responsible for organizing and development of sports in the country are in the dark over the rescheduling of the 30-discipline event involving about 8,000 athletes and 2,000 officials. Said Rajiv Mehta, IOA secretary general: "We have not received any email or letter on our query about the dates of the National Games and we are still waiting. "I have been in touch with the secretary of GOA and the CM's office but there is no response whatsoever on the subject."  , honorary secretary, GOA, an affiliated unit of the IOA, is waiting as well for intimation from the state government.
 
 "Postponing the National Games was a suo moto decision by the government which I cannot convey to the IOA without an official communique," said Bhakta. "The situation is not very encouraging," Bhakta lamented. "If the Games are not held in November, Goa's ability to play hosts will be shown in very poor light when the IOA holds its Annual General Meeting in December."
 
 However, VM Prabhudesai, executive director of SAG, a wing of the Goa government for the development of sport, believes that the IOA will take a sympathetic view of a postponement if any.
