The  's ban on sale of   alongside highways has proven to be expensive as tipplers, barring beer drinkers and those whose favourite swig is cheap liquor, will have to shell out more for a drink from April 1. 

 Liquor is categorized into slabs on the basis of their declared prices and, as expected, the state budget, announced by chief minister   on Friday, proposes to hike additional excise duty (AED) on all slabs barring the one at the bottom by 8%. The proposal will push up the price of a   (180 ml) of Indian Made Liquor (IML) by a minimum Rs 2.50.
 
 Siddaramaiah justified the hike by claiming excise revenue fell short of its target in the current financial year (2017-18) because of the ban on sale of liquor on highways. 
 
 "For the reason stated (SC ban), we expect to mobilize revenue of Rs 17,600 crore for the current financial year," Siddaramiah said. The revenue target fixed for the current financial year was Rs 18,050 crore, but actual collection fell short by about Rs 2,000 crore. The chief minister has fixed an excise revenue target of Rs. 18,750 crore for the next financial year.
 
  The first slab, which includes brands like Raja Whisky and Original Choice and cost up to Rs 449 per bulk litre, has been untouched. Liquor under the second slab (declared price between Rs 450- Rs.499 per bulk litre) which includes brands like   whisky and Old Monk rum, will be dearer by Rs 2.79 per quarter. 
 
 The per quarter   of liquor under the third slab, with declared price between Rs 500- Rs 549 per bulk litre and including brands like Bagpiper and Officer's Choice, will go up from Rs. 68.56 to Rs. 72.14. In all, there are 18 liquor slabs.
 
 The MRP of liquor on the highest slab, with a declared price above Rs 15,000 per bulk litre and including brands such as Blue Label and  , will go up from Rs 783 per quarter to Rs 831.
 
 " The poor generally buy liquor belonging to the first slab and the volume of consumption is also relatively high. The government didn't want to burden people at the bottom of the pyramid, so they have been spared from a price hike," said  , joint commissioner-excise.
