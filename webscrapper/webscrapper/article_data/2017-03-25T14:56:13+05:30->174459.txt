Following our report on   being finalised to play the hero in Edit II Productions' next 'Bhaag Bakool Bhaag', there's more cracking news on the cast. Actress  , who was last seen in ' ', has been roped in to play one of Jay's two wives (as reported) in the show. Playing the title role in the sitcom 'Bhaag Bakool Bhaag', Jay will be seen in two avatars — one of a rural guy and another of a modern urban man — to suit the personalities of his wives. Hiba, who will play the city wife, refused to comment. When contacted, she said, "I am not allowed to speak about it."
The show, we hear, is loosely based on the Govinda, Tabu and Karisma Kapoor-starrer 'Sajan Chale Sasural'. Caught in a Catch-22 situation, Jay, like Govinda in the film, will not be able to disclose about his other marriage to either of his wives. Slated to air on an early evening time slot on Colors, the show will go on floors in the first week of April.
