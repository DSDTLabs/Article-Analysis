NEW DELHI: The   (MACT) has ordered an insurance company to pay a compensation of Rs 1.08 crore to an executive of a private company, who suffered permanent disability following a car accident.

 Noting that wheelchair-bound Archit would need an attendant throughout his life apart from physiotherapy, MACT judge   awarded Rs 19 lakh towards future attendant charges and Rs 8 lakh for physiotherapy sessions, besides other relevant compensation amounts.
 
 Two years ago, Archit was travelling in a car with two other people — one of whom was driving the car and the other was the vehicle owner — when allegedly due to the driver’s rash and negligent driving the car hit a divider. Archit was severely injured in the accident.
 
 Archit’s petition for compensation, filed through his counsel  , also named the insurance company with which the car was insured, along with the two other occupants.
 
 The tribunal court was satisfied with the contentions of the petitioner on the basis of the police report and observed, “...The negligence on the part of the driver of offending vehicle is prima facie proved.”
 
 Archit’s medical bills summed up to Rs 8.86 lakh, which the court awarded under the same caption. Goel also argued that his client had suffered 100% financial loss as a result of the disability. A doctor, who had prepared Archit’s disability report, deposed in court saying the victim was “unable to do any kind of routine work as sitting, standing, walking, etc...” 
 
 “Looking at the nature of injuries, consequent disability, deposition of the doctor and the fact that the petitioner was doing field job and his services have been terminated, the functional disability is taken as 100%,” the court noted while granting Rs 66.24 lakh towards loss of income.
 
 In addition, relevant compensation amounts for mental agony, pain and suffering, special diet and disfigurement were also awarded to Archit, adding up to Rs 1.08 crore.
