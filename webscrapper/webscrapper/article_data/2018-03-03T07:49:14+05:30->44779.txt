TIRUVANNAMALAI: Three   died and two others sustained serious injuries when the compound   of a century-old mutt collapsed on Thiruvudal Street in Tiruvannamalai. 

 The deceased have been identified as K Ramesh, 20, of Edapalayam, M Alamelu, 50, of Pavupattu village, and Laxmanan, 50, of Mathur village. 
 
 The   – Poongavanam, 45, of Kilpennathur, and Abith Hussain, 27, of Tiruvannamalai – were undergoing treatment in the Government Tiruvannamalai Medical College Hospital. 
 
 The incident happened at around 12.15pm when the workers were engaged in digging a trench along the compound wall of the mutt to build a house. 
 
 They had been engaged by   contractor Mani, Tiruvannamalai superintendent of police R Ponni said. 
 
 Dr Srinivasan, a native of Tiruvannamalai, engaged the building contractor to construct a house on a vacant plot next to the mutt. Without taking any precautionary measures, the contractor made the workers dig a trench. 
 
 “The old compound wall lost stability and collapsed. The workers were buried under the debris,” said the SP. 
 
 Locals acting swiftly, rescued three workers from the debris and shifted them to a hospital, but Ramesh and Alamelu were declared brought  . Later, fire and rescue services personnel rescued another worker and retrieved the body of Laxmanan. The condition of Pongavanam and Hussain was said to be critical, said the SP. Police have registered a case and started inquiries. 
 
 It may be recalled that two road construction workers died and another sustained injuries when the compound wall of Ramana Maharishi Ashram along the Girivalam path collapsed on December 15 last year.
