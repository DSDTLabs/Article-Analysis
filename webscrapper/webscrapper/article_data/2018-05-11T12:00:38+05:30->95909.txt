Achamma ( ) is a different girl, who was born in an autorickshaw. She does all ‘don’t do’ things that are imposed upon by the society, when it comes to girls. After promising her dad that she will not hurt him like her elder sister who eloped with a guy, Achamma tries to confine to societal standards.

 To give a break to the monotonous life, she finds herself a Masters in Social Work course at a co-ed college and joins the same. There she meets Hari Krishnan ( ), who is equally a quirky person. Hari is visually challenged but doesn’t want to be called so. Aparna, who misunderstands him as a womaniser initially, becomes a good friend of him. Will the tomboyish Achamma fall for him? If so, how is this ‘blind-love’ going to be? Let’s wait and watch. 
 
 The film, on the other hand, is beautifully crafted with an appealing background score, acting and script.
