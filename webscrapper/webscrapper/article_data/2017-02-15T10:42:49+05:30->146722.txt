HYDERABAD: It was not America as such that   was fascinated with. The glitter and glamour of tinsel town appealed to him more and he wanted to make a foray into Tollywood. 

 The 27-year-old from Vangapahad village, Hasanparthi mandal, in Warangal who went for his MS to the US was   on February 10 by a carjacker. He had completed his studies in December 2016 and was looking to get a good job when was killed in Milpitas, California. His body is expected to be brought to Hyderabad on February 17, Friday. 
 
 According to a friend of Vamsi, so keen was he on getting into   that he used to make the rounds of major film studios in the city, but did not get the break he was looking for. Vamsi spent a lot of time in the gym to make sure he was fit. He also learnt how to play the guitar. Eventually, he was forced to reconcile to the fact that he had to take care of his father, a farmer, and mother who had saved to send him to the US.
 
 To bring back Vamsi's body to India, a team of   (TANA) is working to complete formalities. TRS supporters in the US are coordinating with TANA. A friend of Vamsi in the US told TOI two persons Umanath and Jetti Venkat Rao were currently in touch with the  . TANA representatives have got clearance from the coroner's office. Procedures were initiated on Tuesday and some more formalities have to be completed. 
 
 Going by one friend's account, the culprit had dragged Vamsi out of his car pointing two guns at him and shot him. The killer then sped away with his car. The police apprehended the killer after he crashed the car nearby.
