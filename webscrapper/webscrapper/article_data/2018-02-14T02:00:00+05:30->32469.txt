PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday refused to interfere in the   (PUSU) election, which is scheduled for February 17. The petitioners had demanded that the election process which started on January 2 be postponed till the new academic session of the university begins.

 While hearing a writ petition filed by Patna University students Amar Azad, Sanjeet Kumar, Amit Sarogi, Inzamamul Haque, Faaim Anwar Siddique, Ejaz Shams, Ghulam Ghaus and Anshuman, Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh ordered the PU vice-chancellor to file a counter affidavit within a week providing details of the academic calendar of the university for year 2017-18 and 2018-19.
 
 The petitioners said some of them were interested in contesting the election but were unable to do so because of examinations. They had also cited the Supreme Court order on the basis of Lyngdoh Committee which has recommended that the election in educational institutes be held within six to eight weeks of commencement of academic session.
 
 The court said it would look into the matter that the elections are streamlined according to the academic session onwards according to the rules and regulations.
 
 Though the studentsâ€™ union election should take place each year, the last PUSU election was held in December 2012.
