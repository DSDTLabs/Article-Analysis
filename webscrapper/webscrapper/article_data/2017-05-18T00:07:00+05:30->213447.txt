Thiruvananthapuram: The motor vehicles department is planning to launch a drive to check the use of flashy extra fittings in vehicles.

  will conduct the checks along with cracking down on helmetless two-wheeler riders, drivers not buckling up the seat belt, and those driving under the influence of alcohol.
 
 The fancy fittings include LED lights and other illumination on the roof of vehicles. According to MVD norms, such fittings are included in the unauthorised installation category.
 
 The enforcement wing of the MVD had earlier conducted drive against unauthorised boards and beacons and modification of vehicles.
 
 The department decided to launch the drive following rise in number of complaints by motorists against distractions. 
 
 MVD’s special enforcement squad will monitor such vehicles at various junctions and penalise motorists flouting the rules. MVD can impose a spot fine of up to Rs500 for illegal fittings. The fancy illumination lights used as décor are seen in contract carriages, vans and even in autorickshaws.
 
 According to an MVD official in enforcement wing, only headlights and tail lamps are permitted and any other illumination can distract other motorists, especially those coming from the opposite direction.
 
 “We had been receiving complaints against these illuminated objects in vehicles which distract them while driving. Being a vacation season, a large number of vehicles are seen with illuminated lights plying in the city. These violations are mostly seen in tourist buses,” said the official. 
 
 The drive will be launched next week in the city, after getting the approval of the transport minister.
