 Salem: The charred body of a woman was found behind the bushes in an isolated place near Salem on Wednesday. Police suspect this to be a case of murder but are yet to get any clues to ascertain the identity of the woman or the motive behind the act. Police have started investigating the public if they had spotted any strangers roaming in the locality the previous day.
 
 According to the police, a shepherd noticed the body and informed his villagers who in turn alerted the police. Senior police officials rushed to the place. A postmortem was performed on the spot as much of the body was burnt to be able to take it to the government hospital for the purpose.
 
 Police said public had spotted smoke billowing from behind the bushes near Reddipatti bridge at Suramangalam on Tuesday afternoon. “But they assumed that it must be the bushes that caught fire. So, the incident must have happened early on Tuesday,’’ a police official said.
 
 Police have also asked for CCTV footages from commercial establishments along the road to find out people who crossed the place.
 
 They have also asked all police stations in the district about complaints of missing women registered recently. “Information on missing women would help us identify the body as it could be one of them,’’ said police.
