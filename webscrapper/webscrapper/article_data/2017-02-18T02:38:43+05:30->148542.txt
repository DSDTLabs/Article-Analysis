GURUGRAM: The   has penalised only 101 defaulters for   in the last three months, highlighting the fact that the authorities have failed to keep a check on the banned activity. That’s an average of just over 1 a day. 

 Gurgaon has been among most polluted cities of the country this month.
 
 According to the MCG, 86 people were fined in New Gurgaon areas, while 15 people were penalised in Old Gurgaon for waste burning. Each violator was charged Rs 5,000 as fine.
 
 On November 7, the district administration imposed Section 144 of the CrPC to prohibit open burning of waste/ garbage and promised to take strict action against those violating the norms. 
 
 “While 200 people were penalised post-Diwali (within a couple of weeks) when pollution levels were high, only 101 were fined in the last three months. It shows the authorities act only when the situation goes out of control,” said Amina Sherwani, a city-based environmentalist. 
 
 Green activists have observed that waste burning is still rampant in the city. “I witness at least six waste burning activities if I travel just for 7km in the city. It seems the authorities have not adopted any measure to take strict action against waste burning. Despite the ban imposed by the NGT, waste burning is going on,” said Vivek Kamboj, founder of NGO Haryali.
 
 Niranjan Raje, former member of Environment Pollution Control Agency (EPCA), said, “The particulate matter (PM) was not visible during winter. The human eye only can see particulate matter (PM) with 10 diameter, while PM with 2.5 diameter cannot be seen with the naked eye. Levels of oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, which are emitted from waste burning, are rising in the atmosphere.”
