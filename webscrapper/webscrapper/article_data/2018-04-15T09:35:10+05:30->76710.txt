Gold Coast:   was happy to get the national flag back in her hands as she ran around the Carrara Sports Centre celebrating her victory in the women’s 50kg freestyle event here on Saturday.

 
 
 
 “For the last four years, I’d been waiting to hold the Indian flag in my hands like this. After the Glasgow Games, I hadn’t heard the national anthem inside the arena. In the Rio Olympics qualification, I had come first but there was no anthem or flag raised. I missed that. I’m feeling very proud at having achieved this,” Vinesh said.
 
 Asked about the all-important clash with Jessica Macdonald, the Glasgow gold medallist said: “She’s been a world champion. So there was some pressure competing against her. Our coaches and fans were all hoping that a wrestling gold in the women’s section would come soon. That has come and I’m very happy that I’ve won in this manner, scoring points in a fine away,” she said after winning the bout on technical superiority, which means a gap of 10 points.
 
 Vinesh went after the weaknesses of her opponent while sticking to her strengths. She also used her trump card, the leg attack, to good effect to dominate her rival. “She has great strength in her upper body, and to fight while remaining in contact with her wasn’t easy. I had to stay away from her, and then jump into attack in the hundredth of a second to score points.”
 
 
 
 Vinesh also acknowledged the assistance the wrestlers got from Sushil Kumar. “Right from the morning he’s been with us teaching us what to do. When a champion like him is standing behind you, you get the courage to try and become like him — a champion.”
 
 In the men’s 86kg freestyle, Somveer won the bronze beating Alexander Moore of Canada while Sumit Malik won a gold in 125kg. In women’s 62kg freestyle Sakshi Malik bagged a bronze.
