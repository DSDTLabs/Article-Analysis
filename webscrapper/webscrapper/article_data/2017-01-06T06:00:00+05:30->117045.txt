Visakhapatnam: A low pressure persisted over south Andaman sea and neighbourhood areas on Thursday. The system was also associated with an upper air cyclonic circulation extending up to 7.6 kms above mean sea level.

 The system is very likely to become a well-marked low pressure area over the same region in the next 24 hours and strengthen into a depression in the subsequent 24 hours, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday. TNN
