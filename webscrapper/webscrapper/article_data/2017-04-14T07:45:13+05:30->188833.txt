BELAGAVI: The   (Buda) is likely to start work on its   residential layout (scheme no. 61) in June and simultaneously invite applications from public to distribute sites. “Technical and procedural work of the project is in the last stage and the work will start once the urban development department approves the scheme. All procedural works will be finished within a month. After that, tender will be floated for the development of the layout,”   commissioner   told TOI.

 The proposed layout, spread over 159 acres 23 guntas, faced legal hurdles since the past 10 years. Earlier, the government had asked farmers to accept the formula of 60:40 land sharing after development. As the proposal did not yield a positive response, the cabinet enhanced it to 50:50. 
 
 After this, farmers who possessed 111 acres gave their consent, while the rest approached the court opposing the land acquisition. In June 2016, regional commissioner ordered acquisition of the land, announcing Rs 5.61 crore as compensation to the landowners. However, a court ordered stay on the move.
 
 Ahmed said that the Budais already in possession of the land and the regional commissioner has ordered compensation to those who gave consent to the land-sharing formula. “As a majority of farmers gave consent and the government approved the scheme, we will try to vacate the stay as soon as possible,” Ahmed said. 
 
 According to him, nearly 1,500 sites will be developed in the layout in which 50% will be given to the land owners and the rest to applicants. Buda had conducted a public demand survey for sites in 2010. Surprisingly, it received around 60,000 applications, which shows the demand for Buda sites.
