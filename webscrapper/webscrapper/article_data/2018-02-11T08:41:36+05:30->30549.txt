Through his tweet on October 13 last year, railway minister Piyush Goyal had announced the renaming of   as Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya station. But four months on, one still sees the old ‘Mughalsarai’ signage at the station.

 
 Reason: The East Central Railway (ECR) and Mughalsarai DRM office are still waiting for a formal order from the railway ministry.
 
 While ECR’s chief public relation officer Rajesh Kumar told TOI that “the order of railway board is awaited”,   magistrate Kishore Kumar said, “Once we get the order through ECR, its implementation will be done at the station.”
 
 In June last year, the Yogi government decided to rename Mughalsarai town and its railway station after the RSS ideologue Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. While the name of Mughalsarai town was formally changed to DDU Nagar on September 12, 2017, the Centre’s nod was needed for renaming the station.
 
 The Centre gave its approval in August 2017 after which the state government notified the change. The notification was sent to the railway ministry. The ministry gave a go-ahead but the wait for a formal order has delayed its execution on the ground.
 
 On Upadhyaya’s birth anniversary — September 24 — last year, the   had got a symbolic pole (number 673/1276) installed at the spot at Mughalsarai station yard where the RSS ideologue’s body was found on February 11, 1968.
 
 Interestingly, the RSS and its frontal wings had started calling   Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar since 1970.
