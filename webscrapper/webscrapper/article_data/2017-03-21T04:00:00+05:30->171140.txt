 Japan’s   decided to exit an under-performing joint venture with Tata Teleservices, while Bahrain Telecommunications ( ) snapped ties with C Sivasankaran’s S Tel and UAE’s Etisalat exited the country after the spectrum auction scandal, which erupted six years ago.

The industry will be left with five major players namely — Vodafone-Idea, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, RCom-Aircel-Sistema and BSNL plus MTNL,” Harsh Jagnani, VP, sector head,  , said.
