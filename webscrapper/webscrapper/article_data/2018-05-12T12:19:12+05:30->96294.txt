PANAJI: The state   on Friday chalked out a strategy for preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The   will start with a state-wide tour via public transport to interact with people. The ‘Jana Gana Mana public engagement program’ will also coincide with a membership drive and other public engagements aimed at building the party’s social image.

 The decision was taken at the first Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) meeting held since Girish Chodankar took over as party president.
 
 “Party members will travel to every part of Goa via public transport,” Chodankar said. “We will meet the people in a market place and talk to them. We want to hear about their problems. There will be no speeches.”
 
 The party plans to use the current public disillusionment with the Manohar Parrikar government to build momentum for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
 
 As soon as he took over as GPCC president Chodankar had said that his first task would be to strengthen the party at the grassroots level. In line with that, Chodankar has decided to allot each constituency to one PCC member who will be responsible for strengthening the block-level committee.
 
 To help build the party’s image, which has taken a beating in recent years, the party plans to organise an eye donation camp where Congress leaders will pledge to donate their eyes as well as encourage others to do the same.
