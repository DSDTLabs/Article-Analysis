TRICHY: Chicken lovers in the city are concerned due to the spiraling prices of their favourite meat in the past one month.

 The price of one kilogram of broiler chicken compared to the month of March has increased by around 25% to 30% since the beginning of April.
 
 Higher demand during the summer holidays and decrease in the production of broiler chicken are considered to be the major contributors for the price inflation.
 
 “Generally, the number of customers at every chicken shop increase significantly in the month of April and May and so the price is also increased for these couple of months,” said  , owner of   at Thillai Nagar. He added that chicken shop owners follow the norms set by a broiler committee. 
 
 Currently, one kg of skinless broiler chicken on an average costs around Rs 180-190, while chicken along with skin costs around Rs 160-170. In March, one kg of broiler chicken costed around Rs 130 (skinless) and Rs 120 (with skin).
 
 The increase in the price though has not caused a major effect in the sales as broiler chicken is still sought-after because of their affordability compared to other meat varieties.
 
 It has also been said that broiler chicken generally do not survive in severe heat and hence, the poultry farms decrease the production around this time every year. “Poultry farm owners never take the risk of producing broiler chicken in large numbers during summer. Hence, the reduction in supply is also a major reason for the price increase,” said V M Baskar, owner of A1   at  .
 
 Mohamed Kani, who owns a chicken shop at  , said that the price of chicken would come down once the summer vacations are over.
