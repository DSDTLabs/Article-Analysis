 More than 10 workers were involved in the maintenance work. Around 6pm, the workers were digging soil from upper side to lower side to level the sidewall. 
 
 “The land suddenly slipped along with boulders and stones and fell on the workers,” the   police said. 
 
 Raja got stuck in the soil and died on the spot while the rest escaped narrowly with minor injuries, they said. The police rushed to the spot after alerted by locals. They also sent the body to   Government Super-Specialty Hospital for Postmortem. A case was registered and further investigations are on.
 
 In October 2016, boulders and stones rolled on to the ghat road of Yercaud due to a major landslide at No.13 hairpin bend (HPB). The landslide was triggered by heavy downpour. The district administration banned all the heavy vehicles including timber and sand laden trucks to use the damaged road. Highway department officials started clearing the debris on the roads. They also immediately placed sand bags to give support to the side walls of the ghat road.
 
 However, the highways department officials could not continue the maintenance work due to various reasons including the demise of chief minister J Jayalalithaa. The officials finally obtained the permission and started the maintenance work a couple of days ago.
