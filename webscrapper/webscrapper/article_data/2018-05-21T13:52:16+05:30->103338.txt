PITHORAGARH: Three children who were siblings died of suffocation after getting trapped in a wooden box in a village in   tehsil in   district.
 
  The incident took place on Saturday when the three kids — Nisha, 10,  , 7, and Kartik, 5 — were playing hide-and-seek at their home in   village while their parents had gone out to collect keeda jadi (Himalayan viagra) with a group of other villagers.
  
  Police said that while playing, the three children had hidden in a 10ft x 5ft wooden box, used to store grains, when the lid of the container fell and they were locked in it for over five hours.
  
  Sekhar  , circle officer of Pithoragarh, said, “Prima facie it seems to be a case of accidental death caused due to suffocation but we will conduct a post mortem on Monday. Surendra Singh and his wife went to upper Himalaya with other villagers to collect keeda jadi leaving the three children with their grandparents. The grandparents were out in the field working when the incident took place.”
  
  Kushal Singh, grandfather of the kids, said, “When we reached home around 6pm, we couldn’t locate the children. We looked for them in the entire village but couldn’t find them. At night, a relative spotted slippers beside the grain storage container. We opened the lid and found the children lying senseless inside.”
