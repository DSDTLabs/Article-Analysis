MUMBAI: A   on Saturday remanded  ,   in connection with the  ,   till February 3.

 Tiwari had gone to Hazra’s 15th floor flat with her boyfriend, Pankaj Jadhav, at 3am on December 11, 2017, police said. The next day her body was found in the duct of the highrise.
 
 Hazra was arrested on January 14. The police, in their remand plea, said polygraph tests had revealed he was not telling the truth on “significant aspects of the case”. Forensic reports said the victim’s body had multiple abrasions and injuries and very high alcohol content.
 
 Hazra was produced before a Borivli metropolitan magistrate court where he raised a burqa to reveal his identity to the magistrate and signed a vakalatnama to appoint a lawyer.
 
 A written application sought “maximum possible police custody” since “further probe is needed to check whether anyone else is involved in the crime’’ but no such oral plea was made by the police or the police prosecutor Savita Morale. Hazra’s lawyer B D Hatkar made a plea for judicial custody as he said the “probe is mostly over”.
 
 The Tiwari family questioned the police probe and lack of any other arrests, pointing out her “boyfriend was in the house too that night.”
 
 
 
 My daughter has been murdered and it cannot be the work of only one person. She weighed over 50 kg and it would have needed at least two persons to push her into the duct from the tiny bathroom window. Why are there no further arrests?” asked her father TN Tiwari, a retired senior executive with a company from Jamshedpur, outside the court.
 
 Her mother Indu said, “The guilty must be hanged or sent to prison for life.’’
