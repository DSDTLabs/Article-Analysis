PATNA: JD (U) president and Bihar   has said he will stay away from campaigning in UP, which is going to the polls in February-March.
 
  “I am not going anywhere. I am working on my own agenda of development and have to resume my ‘Nischay Yatra’ from February 4 in this regard. Why should I go to other places to work on the agenda of others?” the CM said on Wednesday when asked if he would campaign in the poll-bound states.
  
  Prodded further on which party he sympathises with, Nitish said with a smile, “Main ‘aap’ ke saath hun (I am with you)”. He, however, evaded a query if he by ‘aap’ meant Aam Admi Party.
  
  Talking about the yatra during which he reviews the progress of welfare schemes launched as part of his ‘Saat Nischay’, or seven resolves, Nitish said he has covered 36 districts. “Only Vaishali and Patna are left. I am going to Vaishali on February 4 and will cover Patna’s rural areas on February 5,” he said.
  
  Prior to announcement of election in five states, Nitish had made several trips to UP and JD(U) had expressed intentions to join the fray in the neighbouring state. Alliance talks were also held with RLD and three other small parties. However, the SP and   announced their alliance and reportedly refused to take any other party on board.
  
  After successful ‘Prakshotsava’ celebrations in Patna to commemorate the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh, a section of JD(U) functionaries had hinted that the party would play a vital role in Punjab polls too. But its core committee meeting in Patna on January 23 decided against contesting the polls in Punjab.
