VIJAYAWADA: The   Tirupati Devesthanams ( ) management on Wednesday decided to issue a notice to chief priest Venkataramana Deekshitulu asking him to show cause as to why action should not be taken against him for his disparaging remarks to the media in Chennai a day earlier against the Tirumala shrine and the way it is administered. 

 "As per the decision of the TTD board, a notice will be sent to him seeking his explanation for allegedly making derogatory remarks against the Tirumala temple management," TTD executive officer Anil Kumar Singhal told the media after a meeting of the temple executive board in Tirumala on Wednesday. He wanted that the centre take over the temple administration and had petitioned against the present temple management to President  , Prime Minister   and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Dipak Mishra. 
 
 According to sources, the TTD also want to question Deekshitulu for reportedly calling on   chairman   in his cottage during the industrialist's visit to Tirumala on April 19. 
 
 Meanwhile, in another development that appeared to target Deekshitulu, TTD chairman Putta Sudhakar Yadav said the temple management is considering bringing archakas also under the current rule that all those who have crossed 65 years of age should retire. Deekshitulu is over 65 years and will have to retire the day the rule is implemented.
 
 Deekshitulu said he will challenge the decisions of the TTD in court. "I have not officially given any intimation about my retirement. Along with me, three more senior priests will be impacted if the retirement rule is extended to archakas. They have no right to do so," he told TOI over phone from Tirumala.
