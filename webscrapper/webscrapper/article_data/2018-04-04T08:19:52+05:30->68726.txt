KOCHI: The high court, on Tuesday, stayed a   against   (IFS)   for allegedly torturing an accused in   using third-degree methods. A stay on the probe was issued by the court after considering a plea by the 2009-batch Kerala cadre IFS officer.

 Uma was the divisional forest officer at the forest headquarters at Thiruvananthapuram and was the controlling officer of the elephant poaching cases spread over Malayattoor, Munnar, and Vazhachal forest divisions. She has alleged that the case filed by Aji Bright of Oruvathilkotta in Attingal alleging torture is intended to derail the investigation by demoralizing her.
 
 No complaint of torture was raised by the accused when he was presented before three magistrates at different times and when two medical examinations were conducted, the officer pointed out.
 
 A complaint by the accused had said a team led by Uma tortured him using third-degree methods that resulted in severe damage to his backbone. State human rights commission had taken suo motu cognizance and had asked the state police chief to probe the alleged incident.
 
 As per the IFS officer’s petition, the case involved poaching of 18 elephants for illegal ivory trade. It had interstate ramifications and involvement of big industrialists and highly-placed persons are suspected.
 
 Claiming to be the biggestever catch in the history of illegal ivory trade in the country, the officer’s petition said the team busted poachers, carriers, transporters, and traders. Raids and arrests were conducted in various parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Delhi, and Kolkata. Altogether, 26 cases were registered, 75 persons were arrested, 465kg of ivory and ivory artefacts, 12 unlicensed guns and eight vehicles seized, the petition stated.
