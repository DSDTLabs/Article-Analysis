NAGPUR: The officials of Kamptee-based   ( ) are planning to shut the club after their   journey was marred by controversies.

 “Everyone knows how we play and what we are capable of but we suffer due to   referees’ wrong decisions. We protested the decisions with valid proofs but nothing happened. Hence, we are seriously thinking about closing the club,”  , Secretary, NFC, told TOI.
 
 The club feel that they have been victimized by NDFA and its referees for last three seasons. This year due to referees’ howlers their team had to bow out of the tournament in Super Six stage.
 
 “We protested against referee’s decisions twice. And both the decisions could have proved vital for us. In our last Super Six match against   (RSSC), a clear self-goal was disallowed by assistant referee. We protested it with a video recording which clearly vindicates our stand. Yet, no action was taken by NDFA,” he added. tnn
