 “I also raised a question on the problem of choked and dirty drains. I specifically queried about the drains running through sectors 21, 25, 28, 29 and 37,” he said. “A technical committee will be put place to tackle the issue. Once this committee submits its report, the problem will be addressed and resolved,” he said. 
 
 “On the request from residents of Sector 21 and 25 regarding shifting their electricity cables underground, I have been informed that since these are old sectors with extremely narrow roads, it would not be possible to undertake it,” he said.
 
 “I have also been promised that Noida will get additional 37.50 cusecs (90 MLD) of Ganga water by 2020. Work on this project is going on and will be completed on time,” he said.
