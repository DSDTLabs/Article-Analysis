LUCKNOW: After TOI wrote about the failure of the central government's   (affordable medicines and reliable implants for treatment) pharmacy in providing even basic medicines to patients at King George's   ( ), a meeting with medicine dealers was held to brainstorm on increasing availability. 

 On Tuesday, KGMU officials said, a circular will be sent to doctors across faculties to send in details of medicines they prescribe to patients and to take note of the ones present with the pharmacy currently. 
 
  "Response from doctors has not been very good previously when they were asked to send in medicine details for purchase. The vice chancellor has taken note of the problem and a circular will be sent to all doctors for larger public benefit," said KGMU spokesperson Prof NS Verma. 
 
 "There has been some procrastination from the medical faculty in this area," he added. "Steps to increase availability will be taken; the licence to sell orthopaedic implants to patients has also been procured. These will be sold from the limb centre by February," added faculty in charge for   Prof Ajai Singh. 
 
 KGMU doctors, on the other hand, said good quality branded medicines should be available at the AMRIT pharmacy and the stress on generic medicines should be put on the backseat in cases of life and death. 
 
  In August 2017, AMRIT pharmacy was launched amid much fanfare by   health minister   through video conferencing. It claimed that around 164 cancer drugs, 191 cardiovascular medicines, stents, implants and in total around 5,200 medicines will be available at the 24X7 functional pharmacy. However, a reality check by TOI exposed the unavailability of even basic medicines at the pharmacy that had patients and their attendants returning empty-handed.
