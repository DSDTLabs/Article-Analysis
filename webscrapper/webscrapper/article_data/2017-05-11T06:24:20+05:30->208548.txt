JAIPUR:   has issued   seeking implementation of its earlier orders on   on the catchment areas of the   in Jaipur.

 The division bench of   and V K Vyas issued the order on a PIL by P N Maindola of the Lok Sampathi Samrakshan Samiti.
 
 The court issued notice to chief secretary, principal secretaries of water resources, revenue, forest, panchayati raj, district collector of Jaipur and commissioners of JDA and JMC.
 
 The petition said the high court had given directions in 2004 to demarcate the catchment area of the Ramgarh dam and declare no construction zone and in 2012 ordered to remove the encroachment on the catchment areas. But it is yet to be complied with.
 
 The petition further sought scrapping the master plan and JDA act 1982 which allows construction of resorts, restaurants, swimming pools, farm houses etc., in the catchment areas of water bodies. It said constructions already made should be demolished. 
 
 There are seven major rivers which make way for Ramgarh dam. They are Bangang, Madhobani, Lakhar, Kedawat, Rahal, Gugalia and Gomati. A no construction zone from 100 meters to 500 meters be fixed from the Centre point of the seven rivers of the Ramgarh dam and other water bodies should be implemented, the petition said.
 
 The petition said four years have passed after the high court order of May 29 2012, but none of the directions have been implemented due to non-definition of the catchment areas of these rivers and demarcation of peripheral hills of Ramgarh and Kukas. 
 
 Beside the rivers there are hills of which peripheral belts are to be declared within forest land for plantation.
 
 The petition sought creation of a nodal agency consisting of experts for overseeing the implementation of the directions made by the court. Since the flow of water from Ramgarh Dam is from the four tehsils of Amer, Virat nagar Jamvaramgargh and Shahpura a nodal agency is required for the planned development so that water flow to the dam is not disrupted.
