CHANDIGARH: The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), north region’s premier centre for tertiary care, is not as satisfied by the   as last year.

 The total allocation to the elite institute for the financial year 2018-19 has risen by only Rs 68.18 crore, against Rs 201 crore the last time.

It has got Rs 3,018 crore this year, against Rs 2,400 crore the last time. “Both are institutes of national importance but there is a huge difference in their budgets. We have 500 teachers against 800 of AIIMS, and there’s a gap in our transport and house rent allowances as well,” said an official in the PGI administration.
 
 Out of Rs 1,207.78 crore the PGI will receive, Rs 892.98 crore will go into paying the staff and Rs 225 crore into buying equipment. The rest will be spent on human resource. From its internal resources, the institute will generate Rs 135 crore for the financial year. Last year, it kept Rs 920 crore for salaries and Rs 210 crore for equipment.
 
 This time the allocation is less, as most of the money required for upcoming facilities such as Mother and Child Centre,  , and a 250-bedded hospital on campus had already been given. In the 2016 budget, the PGI received Rs 938.58 crore, while last year it got Rs 1139. 60 crore.
