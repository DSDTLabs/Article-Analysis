New Delhi: Unaffected by former minister Kapil Mishra’s allegations against Arvind  , JD(U) chief   expressed solidarity with the chief minister and called the controversy a part of BJP-sponsored campaign to unsettle non-BJP governments in the country. 

 Kumar sent JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi to Kejriwal’s residence on Monday to convey that the opposition stood with him and considered him clean and honest despite the fact that his own party MLA has launched a tirade against him.
 
 “I had a thorough discussion with Kejriwal, who said the   campaign is BJP sponsored and yet another effort to defame him and destabilise his government,” Tyagi told TOI.
 
 Kumar was convinced they should stand by Kejriwal and thwart BJP's witch-hunt, Tyagi said.
