GURDASPUR: Coming to the rescue of Sunil Jakhar, the Gurdaspur parliamentary seat contestant for the   who is being labeled as an `outsider', chief minister Amarinder Singh said he had himself successfully contested the Amritsar   election in 2014 despite hailing from Patiala.

 Two other contestants  , joint nominee of SAD-BJP, and Major General Suresh Khajuria (retired) of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) hail from the constitu ency while Jakhar is from Fazilka and his political opponents have been dubbing him as a para-dropped candidate.
 
 Talking to newspersons after accompanying PPCC chief Jakhar for filing his nomination papers on Friday , Amarinder said, “Opponents raise such petty issues in an attempt to mislead the voters.“ He said even previous Gurdaspur MP, late Vinod Khanna, too hailed from Mumbai.
 
 When asked about the party's pre-poll promise of a complete farm loan wavier, the CM said, “The Punjab cabinet has approved the draft notification and the same will be issued after clearance from the Election Commission.“
 
 After filing his nomination papers, Jakhar, in a lighter vein, said the  's decision to field Salaria had come as a relief to him as he was a big fan of Vinod Khanna and contesting against his wife Kavita Khanna would have burdened his heart.
 
 “The BJP is a party of businessmen and industrialists and hence it has chosen Salaria,“ he added.
 
 `Salaria couldn't run his own college'
 
 Taking a swipe at the SAD-BJP's joint candidate for the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha byelection, Swaran Singh Salaria, the CM said he had failed to even run his own medical college in Chintpurini, which had jeopardized the careers of 1,800 students.“A month ago Salaria had approached me to get the ticket from the Congress and now he has managed to get one from the BJP. He will never leave his business interests in Mumbai for the sake of the people of the constituency,“ he alleged.
