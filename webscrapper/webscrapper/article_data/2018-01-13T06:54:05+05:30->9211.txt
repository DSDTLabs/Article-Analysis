 A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice H G Ramesh also ordered notice to the BBMP while adjourning the hearing on a PIL filed by  , an NGO, while posting the matter for further hearing on January 22.
 
 Senior advocate  , appearing for the petitioner trust, submitted that 2,000 applications for registration have not been processed in Mahadevapura and BBMP authorities are not accepting applications or issuing acknowledgements for the hard copy of applications received.
 
 The court was told that as the last day to enrol was Friday, the applicants will not be able to register and exercise their franchise, denying them their constitutional right.
 
 The petitioner trust contended that the demand for production of Form 7 (seeking deletion of name) is wholly unnecessary as a declaration in Form 6 obviates the same.
 
 The petitioner sought direction to the CEO-Karnataka and other respondents to formulate a mechanism to process all applications submitted for inclusion, transfer or any other modification to the electoral roll in a timebound manner.
