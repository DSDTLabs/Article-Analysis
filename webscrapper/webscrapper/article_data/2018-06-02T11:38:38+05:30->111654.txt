MAPUSA: Taking a dig at the   for calling May 26 as ‘betrayal day’, former chief minister Laxmikant   said that the sum total contribution of the Congress (Centre) towards Goa’s development during their 48-year rule will be far less than the contribution of Prime Minister   during the past four years. “During his four years,   has allotted Rs 30,000 core for various major developmental works in the state,” Parsekar said. 

 He also dubbed the Congress’ Jana, Gana, Mana, Nomon Tuka Goykara public outreach campaign “a mere street show”. tnn
