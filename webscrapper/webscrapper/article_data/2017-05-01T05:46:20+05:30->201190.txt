 Police said passersby were shocked at the sight of the car falling off an elevated road and onto a busy carriageway but quickly recovered their wits and hurried to the aid of the vehicle’s occupants.
 
 They took Shithiq Rithviya, who complained of chest pain, and the four others, including three of her relatives, in the vehicle to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. Doctors there said Rithviya died at 8pm of a heart attack she suffered in the accident.
 
 The four others are receiving treatment. Doctors described their condition as stable.
 
 A police officer identified the injured occupants of the cab as Mohammad Ashad, 34, Mohammad Ajmal, 30, Nazeema Nazad Ajmal, 24, and the taxi driver, Mutheeshwaran, 32.
 
 Police said a private cab company owned the taxi.
 
 “The woman and three men in the cab were members of a family from Colombo who had been staying in Mannadi since they arrived in the city,” the officer said. “The car driver was taking the four passengers back to Mannadi, after they finished shopping, when the accident took place at 4.20pm.”
 
 “The front tyre of the car was flat and, as the driver approached a bend in the road near the subway, he lost control of the vehicle,” he said. “The car rammed the parapet along the top of the subway wall, broke through and fell on the road below.”
 
 Sharath Kumar, a witness who was riding past on a motorcycle, said the occupants of the cab were lucky that it didn’t turn turtle and land on the subway on its roof.
 
 “I joined other passersby and helped the injured people out of the vehicle and took them to the hospital,” he said.
