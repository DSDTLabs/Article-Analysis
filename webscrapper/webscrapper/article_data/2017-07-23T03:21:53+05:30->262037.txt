KOLKATA: It may go unnoticed but the   flyover has settled 8mm after the   (TBM) passed under its foundation earlier this month. Some of the buildings under which the TBM passed also lost 5mm of their height but Kolkata   Rail Corporation (KMRC) officials are patting each other’s back for a job well done.

 “We are very happy. We had expected the flyover to settle by about 15mm but it was a mere 8mm. The settlement of buildings was also well within limits. Anything less than 30mm is considered satisfactory. We learnt our lesson from the Howrah District Library that suffered damages due to tunneling. While working on the eastern bank, we strengthened the foundations and the soil before allowing the TBM to proceed,” KMRC managing director   said. 
 
 When asked whether a building can remain safe even after settling by 30mm,   said that cracks do appear but these can be repaired and there is no damage to the structure. The TBM for the east-bound tunnel is now nearly 2066 metres (2.066 km) from Howrah Maidan and 100metres from Strand Road. It will have to move a further 900 metres to reach the spot where the Mahakaran station will be built. Construction of the station started early on Sunday. Both tunnels are expected to reach the under-construction station by November-December. 
 
 “The TBM for the west-bound tunnel is also approaching the spot but will not require traffic restriction when it passes close to the Brabourne Road flyover. Ten buildings will have to be evacuated though. Notices have already been sent to residents of four of these. We plan to commission the entire E-W Metro corridor by December 2020. Our target for the first phase between Sector V and Phoolbagan is June, 2018,” Kumar added.
