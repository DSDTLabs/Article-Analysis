CHENNAI: Medical students and government doctors will go on a protest from March 21 if the Directorate General of Health Services, which conducts online counselling for students under the all-India quota, does not allot 27% of the seats to OBC candidates during 2018 PG admissions scheduled to begin on Wednesday. 

 Representatives of various doctors' bodies said only 3% of the postgraduate seats were reserved for OBC candidates in the 2017 admissions by the Centre against the usual 27%. "There should have been 2,100 OBC students in the DGHS admission list. But the list had admitted only 165 in degree and 18 others in diploma courses. This is against social justice," said  , general secretary of Doctors Association for Social Justice.
 
 Like every state, Tamil Nadu surrenders 50% of its seats to the all-India quota but none of these seats were given to an OBC candidate in a state medical college.
 
 "The state should ensure the reservation roaster is maintained," he said.
 
 The doctors' bodies wants TN to ensure that   rules do not infringe on incentives and reservations for in-service doctors in PG and superspecialty admissions. The state should push for amendments in the Medical Council of India Act, they said.
 
 The representative also wanted the state to issue nativity certificates only to students who have studied in Tamil Nadu from Class I. "  insists students should have studied in their schools from Class I to get nativity certificates," Dr Ravindranath said.
 
 In 2017, when NEET-based admission was first introduced in the state, the total number of government seats under the single window counselling system dropped to 3,546 from 4,225 in 2016. But the number of students from other states went up from 589 in 2016 to 715 in 2017.
