The batch of 1982 of the Kendriya Vidyalaya No1, Jaipur, took a trip down the memory lane and organised a reunion party at a city club recently. The party was organised for the first time after the batch graduated from the school. "We are meeting precisely after 35 years," exclaimed Dr Navjeet Singh Ahluwalia, a cardiologist in Delhi. "There was no way I could give this party a miss. It's so good to meet old friends," he said. At the party, the batchmates - who had come from different cities - were busy talking about their old school days.

 
 
 Recalling how her friend Shailendra Sharma, who is now a software engineer, would get her in trouble, Vinay Sharma, a homemaker from the city said, "Shailendra ne mujhe bahut daant padwai hai. I remember an incident when he asked me to help him sneak out of the class. That time, one of my aunts happened to be a teacher at our school. So, being his good friend, I asked Shailendra's class teacher that my aunt is calling him. And guess what? My aunt didn't come to the school that day. Mera jhooth pakda gaya and iski (Shailendra) wajah se mujhe daant pad gayi."
 
 
 
 Rajnish Sharma, a businessman in Jaipur, was busy hearing stories from others about how he used to spare nobody when he came to his mischievous escapades. "I don't remember a lot of things; ye log mujhe bata rahe hain ki tune ye kiya tha, vo kiya tha. But yes, I was quite a prankster in school. I still am," he laughed off.
 
 Sandeep Sapra, a businessman, said, "We are all occupied in our professional lives that we don't get time to meet each other. While I used to meet few of them sometimes but this is for the first time that I am meeting my entire batch after 35 years."
