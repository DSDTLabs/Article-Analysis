LUCKNOW: Rebel JD(U) leader   on Tuesday became the first former NDA leader to turn up at   president  's residence in Lucknow, asking him to consider joining a 'Fourth Front' of regional and national parties, including Congress, TMC, BSP and Left. 

 The former   MP lauded the 'fruitful' BSP-SP arrangement in the recent   and Gorakhpur bypolls, said that this election would serve as a primer on how opposition parties can come together.
 
 "People remember my role as a NDA convener, and before that how we brought leaders like VP Singh as prime minister. As much as I miss LK Advani and AB Vajpayee's role in my attempt to build alliances, my 'Sanjhi Viraasat Bachao' is a similar attempt to stitch an outfit of like-minded parties. It is with this proposal that I came and met Akhilesh Yadav today," he said.
 
 The former MP said that he was not worried at the lack of consensus over a prime ministerial face if such a front is formed to stop the repeat of saffron party's runway success of 2014.
 
 "Top leaders of 19 parties opposed to BJP attended my first programme in New Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. This exercise will continue till 2019," he said.
 
 Yadav also came in defence of jailed RJD leader and former Bihar chief minister Lalu Yadav, saying his family was being given a rough deal in both fodder scam and railway property sell-out scam cases. "We have higher courts and RJD will appeal. As far as railway cases are concerned, CBI documents have proved otherwise," he said.
