NAGPUR: Dreaded goon Ashish   and his gang on Sunday created a ruckus at the   pump near Medical chowk and thrashed two persons, including the owner  , demanding extortion amount.

 The gang’s leader Felix, already externed from the city for two years, was netted from   locality on Monday along with his accomplice Abhijeet Dhande. 
 
 Police said Felix, along with his close aide Akash Wanjare who is also externed, learnt to have roughed up petrol pump employee   before snatching Rs 1,400 from him. They later barged into the office Kandwe before manhandling him.
 
 The gang also threatened Kandwe for money apart from warning him of dire consequences if he or his employees charged him or anyone close for filling fuel at the petrol pump. Felix has several offences registered against him in the past. His gang, based at Siraspeth, enjoys domination in the locality by engaging in anti-social activities.
 
 Police said Kandwe was reluctant to admit about Felix’s threatening and thrashing him and his employees. It was the CCTV footage which had nailed the lie. Kandwe later agreed to register an offence of threatening and extortion at the Imambada police station after the cops assured him of security and also of taking strict action against the goons.
 
 After the arrest of Felix and Dhande, the cops are now conducting searches for Wanjare and others involved in the incident.
