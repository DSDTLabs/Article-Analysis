MUMBAI: In a first, two city hospitals on Tuesday collaborated to fly the heart and   of a brain dead farmer to the city from Aurangabad.

 The liver went to a patient in his 20s who had unsuccessfully undergone a transplant just 10 days before. “The call from Aurangabad came as a life-saver, literally,” said Dr Ravi Mohanka, transplant surgeon at Global   in Parel.
 
 Global coordinated with Fortis, Mulund, to get the organs on a chartered flight. The heart went to a 56-year-old Nashik woman. “Both hospitals shared the flight cost,” Mohanka said.
 
 The city’s 43rd heart transplant was made possible by the efforts of the Government Medical College, Aurangabad.
