Following the incident we increased patrolling in the city and nabbed the culprits that were found roaming around the college area.”
 
 He added, “The duo confessed to the crime and stated they have looted a total of six youths in the last two months. Their modus operandi was to identify college students wearing gold chain and other ornaments. Then they used to follow them and get into a fight over petty issues. After this, they used beat the students and run away with the jewellery. So far, two youths have lodged complaints with us. We will get the details of other students from the accused during interrogation.”
 
 The jeweller has also confessed to buying stolen jewelleries from the duo at cheaper rates. “The jeweller has also confessed of buying gold jewellery worth Rs 1.50 lakh from the duo. We are investigating the case in detail to find the exact number of people looted by the culprits,” Deshmukh said.
