Being my father's 50th film, I couldn't have asked for a better gift for him than this song' ' this is how filmmaker   describes the Appa I Love You song from his upcoming film,  . The lyrical video uploaded online shows many leading ladies, including Sruthi Hariharan, Amulya, Mayuri, Thara, Shruthi, Pooja Gandhi, Shraddha Srinath, Pranitha Subhash, Meghana Raj, and others, getting emotional after listening to the song, which has received close to three lakh hits online in a week's time.

 Telling us more about the song, Yogish says, 'The father-daughter relationship is the undercurrent of our film, so we felt that having an emotional song would be apt, instead of showing it in a scene. When we expressed this to Arjun (Janya, the composer), he came up with a brilliant composition. It was only after Anuradha (Bhat, singer) had recorded the song that we came to know that her father was in the hospital at the time. This resulted in her infusing a lot of emotion into the song.'
 
  
  
 Speaking about why they played the song to the many heroines, the filmmaker adds, 'Tharun (Sudhir, the director) was very close to his father and I was my father's pet. We found that irrespective of gender, we had tears in our eyes whenever we heard the song. Tharun was keen to play it to the heroines and capture their candid reaction. Nothing was really planned; it just happened. I think that people are connecting with the song because of the simple, yet beautiful lyrics by   that tug at their heart strings, the soothing composition and the fact that Anuradha has given life to the song. It has been beautifully packaged by Tharun and shot by   and team. Everything's worked out well. We knew that song was good, but didn't think that it would go viral.'
