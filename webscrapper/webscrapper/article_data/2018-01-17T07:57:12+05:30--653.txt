PUDUCHERRY:   chief minister V   on Tuesday instructed the director of accounts and treasuries not to extend any facilities (salaries and other perks) to the three   loyalists who have been nominated as members of the legislative assembly in the Union Territory by the Union government.

 "As per the orders / instructions communicated by the hon'ble speaker..., the director of accounts and treasuries is hereby directed not to extend any kind of facility due to a member of the House to any of the persons who are claiming to be nominated as MLAs without prior approval of the finance minister," Narayanasamy said in an order dated January 16.
 
 He said only the speaker or the Madras high court could take a decision in this regard. He warned that misquoting civil accounts manual would amount to contempt of court and contempt of the House.
 
 Narayanasamy's reaction came four days after the finance secretary V Candavelou sent a note to the director (accounts and treasuries), seeking immediate action on payment of salaries and other allowances to the three nominated MLAs.
 
 The   government in the Union territory and the BJP-led government at the Centre are at loggerheads over the nomination of V Saminathan (Puducherry BJP unit president), K G Shankar (treasurer) and S Selvaganabathy (BJP loyalist) to the legislative assembly in June last year. 
 
 The Puducherry government took strong exception to the Union government's decision to nominate BJP loyalists without seeking its opinion. Lt governor   administered the oath of office and secrecy to them at  . The speaker declared that the legislative assembly did not recognize their nomination and maintained that it was done by incompetent authority and without jurisdiction and hence void.
