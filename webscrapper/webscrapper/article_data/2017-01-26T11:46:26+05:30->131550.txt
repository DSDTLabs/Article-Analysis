INDORE: Making efforts to make roads safer for stray animals, an animals’ rights group from the city will conduct a drive in the city on   where dogs and other small   between Bhanwarkuan and   will have reflective collars put on them. The drive will start at 6am and will continue for the coming months so that the animals are visible at night.

 The initiative had been taken three months ago by members of   group who collected old denim clothing from people and started cutting then into shapes of collars.
 
 “We purchased the reflective tape and stitched them onto the belts. The last step was to tackle the huge number of buckles we needed which we purchased in bulk. As many as 100 buckles have been made by us,”  , a member of Paws factory group, said.
 
 The stretch between Bhanwarkuan and Rajendra Nagar Square had been especially chosen by the group for the drive given the high number of accidents which happen there. One of the major reasons for accidents was because the animals were not visible at night. Mostly dogs and cows sitting on the road caused the road mishaps. Group members also plan to feed the stray animals with biscuits, milk and toast during the drive.
