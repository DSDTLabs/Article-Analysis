NEW DELHI: President   joined the debate on Ambedkar’s legacy by saying that the framer of the Constitution stood for non-violence in pursuit of social justice and equality.

 
 “In his final speech in the Constituent Assembly, Ambedkar said now that we have constitutional methods of expressing opposition, we should avoid disruptive mechanisms,”   said at a function in  , birth place of Bhimrao Ambedkar, on his 127th birth anniversary Saturday.
 
 The remark came in the midst of a bitter debate over Dalit rights triggered by the   judgement putting checks in the implementation of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. The protests called by Dalit groups on April 2 were marked by violence and arson as also police action. Kovind, who flagged “right to equality” and “universal franchise” as two biggest contributions of the Constitution, appeared to nudge the Dalit community to avoid extremes in search of their objectives.
 
 “He (Ambedkar) fought for welfare of weaker sections of society but his path remained nonviolent – stressing consensus through dialogue. He believed that this was our country, for all of us, and that whatever needed to be done to bring justice to the weaker sections of society could be achieved by adhering to social harmony,” he said.
 
 The President only used the terms “traditionally disadvantaged” and “weaker sections” in his speech.
 
 In what appeared a bid to convey that underprivileged sections had gained through the twin constitutional guarantees of equality and voting, Kovind said, “These rights, along with the importance of education that Ambedkar underlined, are crucial for the proper exercise of all other rights granted to citizens by our Constitution.”
