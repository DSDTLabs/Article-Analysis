Vadodara: Citizens can heave a sigh of relief from Saturday with the widened Shastri Bridge being inaugurated. The inauguration is in time as the area witnesses heavy traffic jams during monsoon, particularly when the Alkapuri railway underpass is waterlogged.

 Work on the bridge had been delayed considerably and was well beyond its deadline. The work order for the project was given on June 23, 2014, and work was to be completed in 18 months. But instead of December 2015, the work got over only recently and finishing touches to the project were being given even on Friday.
 
 The bridge has been widened at a cost of Rs 30.39crore. Apart from being a bottleneck, the narrow bridge used to witness accidents frequently.
 
 Chief minister (CM) Vijay Rupani is scheduled to inaugurate the bridge along with other civic works in the city on Saturday. The works to be inaugurated include the state-of-the-art sewage treatment plant (STP) at Rajiv Nagar on the New VIP Road that has come up at a cost of Rs 88.51crore.
 
 The storm water drain laid parallel to the national highway from Darjipura at a cost of RS 31crore will also be inaugurated by Rupani. The work will ease the waterlogging in the eastern parts of the city during monsoon. The CM will also inaugurate the renovated Sindhusagar pond and conduct the draw for 166 houses that have been constructed at a cost of Rs 166crore. In all projects worth Rs 322.71crore will be inaugurated by Rupani.
 
 The STP and Sindhusagar have, however, been mired in rows as the residents of areas around the STP opposed it as it was raising a stink when operated on a trial basis. Regarding Sindhusagar, opposition Congress alleged after a visit to the pond that it had not been deepened properly and water accumulated in it was raising a stink.
