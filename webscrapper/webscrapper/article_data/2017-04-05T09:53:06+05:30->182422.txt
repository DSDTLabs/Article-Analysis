PANAJI:   (GBA) has urged town and country planning (TCP) minister   to not start work on either RP-2021 or RP-2031 till the plan envisages a clear process and criteria for the protection of eco-systems and Goan identity. GBA said that a proper planning process, after consultation with local self governing bodies and stakeholders, followed by activation of   (DPCs) for both districts as constitutionally mandated, was necessary before the RP was implemented.

 GBA, in its meeting held on Monday, noted that the elected and administrative government wings were making confusing statements on the RP and outline development plans (ODPs). GBA alleged that ODPs for municipalities have exposed a disastrous single-point agenda of increasing built-up area or floor area ratio (FAR) so far. The governmentâ€™s arbitrariness in planning had resulted in three of its ODPs being challenged in courts, said a GBA statement.
