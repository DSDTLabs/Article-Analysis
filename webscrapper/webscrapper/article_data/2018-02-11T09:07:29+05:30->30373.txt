MACHILIPATNAM: Minister for youth affairs Kollu Ravindra and local MP Konakalla Narayana Rao laid foundation stone for a Rs 22.70 crore   plant here on Saturday.

 The minister and the MP also laid foundation stone for a sewerage plant at a cost of Rs 21.50 crore. Speaking on the occasion, Ravindra said the two projects were funded under the district headquarters’ Amruta scheme (central government). He asserted that the drinking water scheme will end the water problems of the town. He said the existing drinking water system which was installed by the British was not able to meet the drinking water requirements of the region. “This new scheme will end the water woes of the town,” he said.
 
 The minister said the state government in coordination with the central government had taken up the programmes to provide basic infrastructure to the urban and rural areas. Road connectivity, drinking water supply, drainage system and street lights are being provided on a priority basis across the state. Machilipatnam will get these facilities under these special programmes, he added.
 
 Rao said the government was ready to provide an additional 20,000 tap connections to the people if the construction of the new drinking water plant was completed. The new plant will also supply drinking water to neighbouring Pedana town. The MP further said the state and the central governments were going to develop basic infrastructure in the towns under the urban development plans. The government’s focus is more on drinking water, roads and drainage system for every town, he said.
 
 Municipal chairman  , vice-chairman P Kasiviswanadham, market yard chairman Ch Subrahmanyam, municipal floor leader P Subrahmanyam, councillors Bathina Dasu, Kasani Rangamma and others were present.
