When I was a little girl I was gifted my little point and shoot camera by a grand aunt. I pointed the lens up at the coconut tree in my house compound light was streaming through it. I captured a frame and got the roll developed. When I saw the photograph I felt something. Maybe it was love.
 
 
 I have followed my heart and I’m here. I was the only girl in my class in the film institute. I have been the only woman on many sets, but when a passion consumes, you   becomes irrelevant. It is a male-dominated industry. That’s a fact. There are biases and discrimination, but if you keep proving you have talent, the glass ceiling will have to break. Common bias is, ‘can she shoot action’, ‘shoot hand-held command’ and ‘run a set’. These things are very easy for me. The questions should be ‘can this   translate my vision into images’, ‘tell my story effectively with her lens and lighting’ and ‘are the director and cinematographer able to bring a story to life as a team’. Ultimately, what I get out of my job has little to do with the limits placed on me because of my gender. The joy of doing what I love surpasses them.
 
 
 I want   and more opportunities, because unless women have mentors — men and women who back them — we can’t be represented in the work force equally. The number of women cinematographers are fewer when compared to men across the world. The first woman cinematographer’s Oscar nomination happened this year, so there is hope. She has shone the light. I wish for a future where talent should decide who gets the job, not gender. It takes strong men to support strong women. Every male director who has chosen me has my utmost respect for that. They made the choice not based on gender, but talent.
