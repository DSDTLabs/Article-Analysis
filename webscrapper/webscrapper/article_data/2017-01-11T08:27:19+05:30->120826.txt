BHUBANESWAR: Following intense media glare on hunger-struck children from   in chromite-rich Sukinda valley following death of 22 children in three months from March to May last year, the government has spent over Rs 20 crore for development of the village. 

 This works out to be around Rs 17 lakh a family since the tribal village has just 116 families or Rs 3.50 lakh a head. The village has a population of around 570 people.
 
 Collector (Jajpur)   said here on Tuesday that the government spent Rs 13.5 crore from the   for a road to the village. Similarly, another Rs 25 lakh from other government sources was spent on internal road among the four hamlets of the village. "Money was also spent on constructing a school building, four tube wells for drinking water," he said.
 
 Das was speaking to mediapersons after attending an NHRC hearing on plights of Nagada village. "The motorable roads are in advanced stages of construction," he said. The NHRC asked the government to apprise it of its progressive action plan to prevent malnutrition deaths in Nagada and similar other villages.
 
 Nagada, a habitation of Juang tribe, which is identified   (PVTG), is within 10 km radius of 10 big chromite companies in the industrial belt of Jajpur district. However, due to no road connectivity, the village under under Chungudipal gram panchayat remained untouched by any government initiative till it was highlighted by the media some months ago.
 
 The government had formed a taskforce under the   (RDC), central division to ensure holistic development of Nagada village. Nodal officers were appointed for health, energy, road connectivity, food and drinking water security of the village.
