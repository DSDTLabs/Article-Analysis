BHOPAL: It has not even been a week since the   left Bhopal, that the city’s sanitary conditions have returned to ‘normal’. With garbage spilling on the roads, or rotting in the bins,   Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) cleanliness drive seems to have ended with the survey.

  
 “Garbage has returned and there has been no cleaning in the area for three days. This is the same place where chief minister   and the elected representatives of BMC had called on for the Swachh Bharat Mission,” said a resident of Ahata Rustam Khan. “There is no behavioural change and it seems impossible as BMC does not impose fines,” he said.
 
 The situation is the same, just five kilometres away at Koh-e-Fiza. Residents have complained about the unhygienic living conditions due to a drain along BDA colony — an issue that remains unresolved for years. The situation would only get worse during summer, said residents. What is even more alarming is the Hoshangabad Road highway stretch along RBI and Maida Mill — a sight that calls for immediate remedy.
 
 “After the city reported its first case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) last year, the administration took some notice. As of now, there is no controlling the growth of stray animals including pigs. The railway track and empty stretch of government land is becoming an ideal breeding ground for them,” said a private medical consultant who lives in the area.
 
 The numerous posters lined across Bhopal encouraging the city to become ‘Number 1’ in the Swachh Survekshan 2018 do little to change the on-ground reality.
 
 “All these are cosmetic changes. The real change needs to come from within. Not far away from  , the slums reveal another picture of apathy and negligence,” said a resident.
 
 The BMC officials said, “Our teams have a fixed schedule, which is followed every day. If there are any complaints, they will be resolved through call centre.”
