NEW DELHI: The ruling   is headed for a comprehensive defeat in Uttarakhand and may end up with single-digit figures in the 70-member Assembly.

 The party's drubbing is manifested in the defeat of its chief minister  , who has lost both the assembly seats he contested.
 
 While Rawat has lost Haridwar (rural) assembly seat by over 12,000 votes, he has been defeated by  's Rajesh Shukla in Kichcha assembly seat by 2154 votes
 
 "Rawat's defeat is a total rejection of his leadership," said state BJP spokesperson Munna Singh Chauhan. 
 
 He attributed Rawat's defeat to thriving corruption and a strong anti-incumbency in the state.
 
 Chauhan said the massive surge of support for the BJP was due to a clear "Modi wave which has only gathered steam over the two-and-half years of his extra- ordinary performance at the Centre".
 
 "Narendra Modi's style of leadership, his head-on approach towards dealing with corruption inspired confidence among the masses who voted overwhelmingly in favour of the BJP for a clean and accountable government," he said.
 
 In the run up to the elections, several Congress MLAs had dumped Rawat and joined the BJP.
