Pune: The Hadapsar police on Sunday arrested a  , Sachin Vishnu Gaikwad (38), from Ambegaon Budruk for   a group of 24 people to the tune of over Rs 11.34 lakh. Gaikwad had allegedly collected the money from them to book their flight tickets. 

 The fraud came to light after one of the group members, Prakash Shivarkar (51) from Gadital in Hadapsar, lodged an FIR against Gaikwad. 
 
 “The group had approached Gaikwad through an acquaintance and had instructed him to book their flight tickets to Indonesia from Mumbai for May 17. Gaikwad collected varying amounts through cash/cheque from them and promised to arrange the tickets at the earliest but did nothing,” said assistant inspector Kiran Londhe.
 
 Londhe said, “When some of them called Gaikwad and told him to hand over the tickets, he told them that his father had passed away in Solapur and that he could not come to Pune. He told them to reach the airport where he had arranged to hand over the tickets to them, but no body came to give the tickets.”
 
 “That is when the people realised they had been cheated and launched a hunt to trace him. The group members later came to know that Gaikwad’s father had not expired. They managed to nab Gaikwad and handed him over to the Hadapsar police,” he added.
