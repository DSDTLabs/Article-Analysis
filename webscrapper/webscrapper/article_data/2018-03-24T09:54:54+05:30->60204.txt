NAGPUR: With summer just setting in, the city is witnessing water crisis.   activists took out a rally on Friday condemning Nagpur Municipal Corporationâ€™s failure to tackle water shortage and provide 24X7 water supply.

 Two days ago, newly appointed chairman of water works consultative committee Pintu Zalke claimed there would be no water crisis during summer.
 
 NCP activists led by city president Anil Ahirkar and corporator Duneshwar Pethe took out a rally to the NMC head office, Civil Lines. They met deputy municipal commissioner  , officiating superintending engineer (water works)   and other officials and demanded to solve water crisis. They warned of severe agitation in case water shortage prevails in the city.
 
 The delegation also demanded to restrict increase in property tax to two times. Other demands include exemption from property tax for properties measuring below 1,000 sqft on lines of Mumbai, increase in ward and zonal funds, control of series of fire incidents at   dumping yard, exempt from copy of rental agreement and registry for   admissions and control of stray dogs.
 
 NCP leaders Raju Naggulwar, Ramesh Phule, Vishal Khandekar, Devidas Ghode, Mahendra Bhange, Sanjay Bhagat and others were present in the agitation.
