 Raw commenced from two different locations: The Brooklyn Centre and The Manhattan Center – that hosted the very first edition of Raw where   defeated Damien Demento in the main event. 25 years later, The Deadman reappeared at the same venue and had a rather cryptic and mysterious message to deliver that all but point to one conclusion: The Undertaker may finally be done with wrestling.
 
 
 
  
  
 "I declare for all of those who have fallen, it is truly time... you Rest in Peace," Taker said. 
 
 Taker highlighted the carnage that began on this very sacred ground twenty five years ago, how he's been "digging holes" and any person who came in his path, got "buried into the ground". How for 25 years, he has pulled men from their pedestals and put them into the cold, dark Earth, and that the likes of Stone Cold Mick Foley and Kane, have all tried and failed to conquer him.
 
 It was also interesting to note how the Undertaker appeared in a different outfit that his usual one, without the coat, gloves or hat - that he left behind in the ring since his loss to Reigns. There have been rumors pointing towards a match against John Cena at Wrestlemania 34, but the fact that Taker stuck to the storyline from Mania suggests that he might well be done.
