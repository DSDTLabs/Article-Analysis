PATNA: The   department on Monday forecast moderate to heavy rainfall across the state over the next 48 hours. “The low pressure area forming over Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal led to an associated upper air cyclonic circulation extending up to 9.1km above mean sea level, which is contributing to active monsoon in Bihar,” said a Met official. 

 Meteorologists have forecast moderate rains in Patna with the likelihood of heavy intensity showers as well. “Humidity is likely to persist due to continuous rain activities,” they said.

Active rainfall is being witnessed all over the state, while isolated places are reporting heavy rainfall activity,” Patna Met department director Soumendu Sengupta said. “Southern parts of the state are likely to witness heavy showers due to another cyclonic circulation forming over northwest part of Bay of Bengal,” he added.
