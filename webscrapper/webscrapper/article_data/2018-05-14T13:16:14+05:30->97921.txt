LUDHIANA: Charging Rs 48.37 as value added tax (VAT) on product’s   after discount has cost a clothing store Rs 4,000.

 The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum comprising president   and member   imposed the fine (Rs 2,000 for mental harassment and an equal amount as litigation expenses) on Colorplus Fashions Limited Franchise, The Attire-7, Carnival Complex, Mall Road.
 
 Vivek Maini, a resident of   in  , had moved the forum against the store in February 2017.
 
 Vivek in his complaint to the forum stated that he purchased a shirt from showroom on February 15, 2017 after tendering an amount of Rs 848 against the invoice. The maximum retail price of the product was Rs 1,599 and after a rebate at the rate of 50% on the MRP, the cost came to Rs 799.50. However, the franchise charged Rs 48.37 as VAT on the price after discount. The complainant alleged that practice of charging VAT on the discounted price is illegal. He sought a refund of the excess amount of Rs 48.37 with interest at the rate of 18% per annum besides compensation of Rs 25,000 for mental and physical harassment and litigation expenses of Rs 15,000.
 
 The respondent refuted saying that the VAT can be charged from the customer. The respondent in a written reply stated, “Display boards in the shops have been put up mentioning levy of extra VAT on sale. The expenses claimed by the complainant are exorbitant. The customer paid VAT and bill amount after voluntarily buying the goods, and now he (complainant) cannot raise any such dispute.”
 
 The forum observed that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has also held that shops selling goods at 40% discount cannot charge VAT or any other duty on the discounted price.
 
 This practice of charging VAT was unfair trade practice. The forum directed that the extra amount charged must be refunded with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of purchase, besides compensation and litigation expenses.
