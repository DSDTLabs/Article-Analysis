Udhagamandalam: The residents of   area at Gudalur taluk in the Nilgiris had been living in fear for the past couple of days after they sighted a   in their habitat. Two cows were found dead in the locality and the locals alleged that the animals were killed by a carnivore. The residents said they had taken up the issue with the forest department, but there was no response from the officials.

 “The tiger on the prowl has sent the residents panicking. The situation is quite alarming because the tiger is often sighted in the human habitat. The carnivore had killed two cows on Friday. We had alerted forest officials about the tiger movement in the area, but they are yet to take any action,” A Rangan, a local resident, said.
 
 A wildlife activist, who didn’t want to be named, heavily came down on the forest officials for their inaction, saying the forest department should act quickly in situations like this. “The presence of foresters will, to an extent, alley the fears of local residents. The big cat had been roaming near Nilakottai area for the past couple of days and it had already killed two cows. It’s high time the forest officials ensured the safety of local residents and their livestock,” he said.
 
 According to the activist, around 40 cows were reported killed by carnivores in Gudalur area in the past six months. “The lethargic attitude of the forest officials is highly condemnable,” the activist added.
 
 The local residents, meanwhile, said they were afraid to come out of their homes. “We feel highly insecure as a tiger is on the prowl. Once it gets the taste of human blood, the carnivore wouldn’t leave the human habitat,” said another resident, who is also a social worker.
 
 TOI made several attempts to reach the district forest officer (Gudalur division of forest) for his comments, but the official didn’t respond to the calls.
