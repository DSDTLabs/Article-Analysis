LUCKNOW:   has directed   to appear before a committee for not furnishing details of its  , as sought by the university in December.

 The university had received complaints about the college’s self-finance courses and their affiliation. LU had written to the college on December 16, asking for detailed information about the courses. Later, the university had formed a committee.
 
 “There were complaints about affiliation of some courses, while in some, students were not admitted according to rules. LU had earlier constituted a committee to look into the matter. The coordinator of the committee had sent reminders to the college to give point-wise information on December 16,” said LU spokesperson NK Pandey.
 
 However, there was no response to the university’s letter, he added. Registrar RK Singh has now asked the college to appear before the committee on Monday with all documents sought.
 
 Pandey said the college has been asked for names of all self-finance courses,   and a copy of the university’s affiliation letter.
 
 IT College principal Vinita Prakash said, “LU informed the college that guardians of students have complained against the college. However, names of guardians given by the university do not match our records.”
 
 She added, “We wrote again to the university to give us names of the students so that we can organize a meeting with them to know if they are bonafide students of the college or not and then listen to them. But the university has not given us the names.”
 
 Prakash said the college had sent replies to all letters from the university. She added that the college has organized a meeting on Monday to listen to students’ problems and students can join the meeting.
 
 “It is strange that these students are not complaining to the college about any issues but to the university directly. This raises suspicion about them being bonafide students,” she said.
