Mangaluru: The district administration has set up a committee to look into the issue of pollution of the Gurupur River, Mangaluru City Corporation commissioner Mohammad Nazeer said.  The committee consists of officials from MCC, zilla panchayat, department of industries and Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and the revenue department, which will monitor the visible pollution of the river. Taking note of concerns expressed by CPM corporator Dayanand Shetty at the monthly council meeting of MCC on Wednesday, the commissioner, who earlier in the day attended a meeting chaired by deputy commissioner Sasikanth Senthil, said the DC is seized of the issue and has got all stakeholders on board to address the issue. The DC has already held meetings with all the departments concerned and given each of them specific directions to address the same, he said. Admitting that MCC too has limited liability in the river getting polluted, Nazeer said the DC has asked the civic body to ensure that no sewage joins the river through open storm water drains. In addition, there is the issue of untreated effluents discharged from industrial units in Jokatte that join the river downstream of the Gurupur vented dam and the same get stacked against the dam with the ingress of salt water from the sea upwards towards the dam, he said. The pollutants and any debris in the river and the sea that flow inland normally gets dissipated with free flow of river water upto December and pollutants tend to get accumulated downstream of the dam once the planks are lowered to supply drinking water, he said. Deepak Poojary, corporator, said the civic body also has to take cognizance of industrial units discharging untreated effluents in to river while acting on DCs directions on untreated sewage in to the river.
