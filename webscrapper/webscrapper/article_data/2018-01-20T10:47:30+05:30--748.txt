PUNE: State education minister Vinod Tawde on Friday said the process of closing down 557 of the 1,300 schools with less than 10 students had started and their complaints would be reviewed soon.

 “The process of shutting down 557 schools has begun. It is wrong to say that   guidelines have not been followed while closing down the schools. Of the 557 schools where the process has started, 50 have filed complaints and we will review them. If we find merit in these complaints, we will not close them down,” Tawde said while speaking on the sideline of a function organised at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology.
 
 Tawde and   chairman   were present for the function which also saw the launch of the new website of  , unveiling of DTE information brochure, release of TEQUIP-2 report for Maharashtra and launch of Maharashtra chapter of community building online platform named Fourth Ambit.
 
 He said the government has already prepared its reply to the National Human Rights Commission’s notice against school closure and will be sending it in a day or two.
 
 On non-payment of salaries faced by teachers of Sinhgad group of Institutes, Tawde said, “The institute keeps saying that the social welfare department hasn’t released funds. This is wrong. We have released 60% of the funds and remaining will be released in a soon. Secondly, from next time, scholarships will be credited directly to students’ accounts instead of the college account.”
 
 Tawde also made it clear that schools won’t be able to refuse admissions to students allotted seats under RTE without proper explanation. “We have come up with a system so that schools do not refuse admission to students without base if he or she has been allotted the school through online allotment system. The school, if refusing admission, will have to provide the parent with a receipt stating the reason for refusal. Receipt has to be given also if the admission is accepted,” he said.
