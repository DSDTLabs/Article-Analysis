HYDERABAD: Irked by the indifferent attitude of administration towards resolving academic issues, students of the National Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management ( ) launched a relay hunger strike on Wednesday demanding suspension of the institute director  .
 
 NITHM students have been protesting since April 11 against a host of issues, including abrupt change in assessment pattern.
 
 On Wednesday, as many as 18 students sat on a strike as others extended their support by raising slogans and carrying posters decrying the institute’s apathy towards their concerns.
 
 Protesting students demanded that the institute be recognised as a university. Slogans of ‘we want justice’ resonated at the Gachibowli campus where students continued to protest till late night.
 
 The administration’s appeal to students, to call off the the strike, failed to have any impact. On the contrary, students said that they were determined to strengthen their agitation by constituting a joint action committee soon. Local police had to intervene.
 
 Following the protests, authorities set up a two-member panel comprising tourism commissioner B   and Tourism Development Corporation’s MD   to probe the matter. “The government committee shall visit the institute on Thursday to discuss various issues raised by students and come up with an amicable solution,” said the NITHM director.
