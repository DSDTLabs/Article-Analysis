NEW DELHI: Two children who had been abducted by two women in separate incidents were reunited with their families by the northeast district police.

 In the first incident, an 11-year-old boy was kidnapped by a woman as she wanted a male child. The police received a call on Saturday evening that a woman had been caught while trying to kidnap a child. The woman said that she always wanted a son, but couldn’t have one due to medical issues. When she saw the boy playing in the park, she decided to kidnap him.
 
 A case under IPC sections 363 (kidnapping) and 506 (criminal intimidation) was registered at Bhajanpura police station and the woman was arrested. “The accused said that she had two daughters and wanted a male child,” said DCP (northeast) Ajit Kumar Singla.
 
 In the second incident, a child, who was allegedly kidnapped six years ago from Gokulpuri, was rescued from Ghaziabad. A reward of Rs 20,000 had been declared to trace him.
 
 “One Rabbu Salam had filed a complaint on February 1, 2011 about his five-year-old son going missing. Cops checked government-run child shelters in Delhi and adjoining areas and other homes run by NGOs, but couldn’t find the child,” Singla said.
 
 On February 6, the child was located in a private orphanage in Sahibabad. He had been lodged there by UP Police. “The child’s parents had since shifted to Bihar. However, the landlord was able to provide their address. The boy’s father was called to Delhi and taken to the orphanage where he identified his son. The child has no recollection of how he was kidnapped,” Singla added.
