Panaji: Communist Party of India (CPI), Goa state council, on Tuesday, said it is the responsibility of the labour and employment ministry to formulate a comprehensive policy on the issue of employment.  All employers must compulsorily submit the list of vacancies to the employment exchange and recruitment must be carried out through the assistance of the employment exchange. Secretary, CPI, Goa state, R D Mangueshkar, said in case the government fails to provide gainful employment to the unemployed youth who are registered on the rolls of the employment exchange, the government must provide an ‘unemployment allowance’ which should be not less than Rs 5,000 a month, till the person secures gainful employment elsewhere.
