GURUGRAM: A man was stuck in the mangled remains of a pick-up truck for more than an hour after it rammed into another vehicle near Shankar Chowk on Delhi-Gurugram expressway. Police and fire brigade teams reached the spot and rescued him after cutting open the vehicle. The man, identified as Ajmal (25), was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

 Cops said a tyre of a Mahindra Bolero Pick-Up developed a puncture while descending from Shankar Chowk flyover on the expressway around 4am on Thursday. The driver stopped to replace it. As the driver and his helper were changing the tyre, another pick-up, allegedly speeding, rammed into the vehicle. 
 
 While the driver and helper of the first pick-up, who haven’t been identified, didn’t suffer any injuries, Ajmal, the helper of the second pick-up, got trapped in the cabin while driver Aadil managed to break free. A passenger travelling with the duo suffered minor injuries, but fled.
 
 Aadil contacted cops, and a team from DLF 2 police station soon reached the spot. After they were unable to rescue Ajmal, the fire brigade was called, and he was finally pulled out after they managed to cut the vehicle open.
 
 “We were informed about the   around 4.25am. We first tried to extract the man with the help of a hydraulic cutter, but realised he was severely injured and that it might harm him further, so we used an   instead. We cut open a door and the vehicle’s roof and finally pulled him out with the help of a crane. He suffered grievous injuries in his head and legs. He was immediately rushed to General Hospital in Civil Lines,” said Ramesh Saini, additional fire officer.
 
 From there, he was referred to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, where his condition is reportedly critical. No FIR has been registered so far. “We have removed the vehicles from the road and are waiting for Ajmal’s statement,” said head constable Devender Kumar, the investigating officer.
