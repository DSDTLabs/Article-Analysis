 That film, last month, had won the SAG Awards' equivalent of best picture outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture over best picture Oscar winner ' ' and almost-winner 'La La Land', which wasn't nominated for the ensemble award. 
 
 Also going home empty-handed after this year's Oscars were Dev Patel-starrer 'Lion', up for six awards; 'Hell or High Water', nominated for four; 'Jackie', up for three; and two-time nominees 'Deepwater Horizon', 'Florence Foster Jenkins', 'Kubo and the Two Strings', 'Moana', 'Passengers' and 'Rogue One: A   Story.' 
 
 Meanwhile, 'Arrival' only won one award, for best sound editing, after receiving eight nominations, tied with 'Moonlight', which won three awards, for the second-most nominations this year.
