: Taking a serious view of the lenient attitude of Andhra Pradesh’s public representatives, including ministers, and officials towards cock fights, betting and other unlawful activities during Sankranti, the   on Tuesday told   that its DGP and chief secretary will be held responsible if such activities recur this Pongal season.

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice G Shyam Prasad were critical of the AP authorities while hearing a public interest petition filed by K Ramachandra Raju, who charged AP officials with inaction despite rampant gambling.
 
 
 
 
 The bench went through reports furnished by the district collector and SP and felt nothing much is being done at the ground level to prevent cock fights and gambling despite court orders.
 
 Taking objection to the claims that the   had permitted the practice, the bench said what the apex court had said was that the seized birds be returned but it should not be seen as permission to hold cock fights.
 
 Referring to the statement made by a minister in support of cock fights, the bench said those in authority should not be seen making such loud proclamations.
 
 The bench also sought to know from the state the number of cases it has booked against violators. “If you can’t implement the law, tell us. We will select an officer and direct you to appoint him to deal with these crimes,” the bench said. The case will come up for hearing again on January 4.
