NEW DELHI: The   administration on Friday called in the cops for an innocuous event held by the students to discuss the issues of infrastructure and other systemic problems in the campus. 

 The Jan Sunvayi, a first-of-its-kind assembly of students called to raise concerns over the rising cases of sexual harassment and alleged corruption in the college, was conducted amidst high police presence. The meeting was organised by a newly-formed non-political outfit, Students' Collective.
 
 The gathering, which witnessed participation of over 100 students across departments, saw students raising issues such as sanitation, infrastructure, misappropriation of students' funds and lack of democratic and transparent functioning of the administration.
 
 "According to the university guidelines, all colleges and departments must have an internal complaints committee (ICC), which is absent in our college," said a student at the meet. 
 
 Students also said that funds were not released for various college societies and blamed the administration for its "autocratic functioning".
 
 "Around 200 students attended the event to discuss the prevailing problems. We also tried to look at the Ramjas College constitution. We have decided to form audit committees to look into various problems and document them for further action," said Abinash DC, a student who organised the programme.
 
 Even the teachers supported the students. "It is a unique initiative undertaken by the students where they have assembled and participated in a truly democratic venture. They have attempted to reclaim their space and other colleges should emulate that," said a college teacher.
 
 The students, however, condemned the "administration's decision to place police in the campus after some miscreants created a false narrative that violence was possible at the event."
 
 Despite repeated attempts, the administration did not respond to queries over the deployment of police in the campus.
