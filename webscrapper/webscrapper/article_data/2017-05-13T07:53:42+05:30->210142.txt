CHENNAI: Several areas of   went without power for nearly six hours since 6am on Thursday after a pelican sat on, or touched, feeder lines from Kalivendapattu to  . Staff checking the   later found the bird’s charred body.

 “Early in the morning, two feeder lines from Kalivendapattu to Taramani tripped. These lines bring power from south Tamil Nadu to the Taramani sub-station from where power is supplied to many areas in South Chennai. It is mostly wind, solar and power from Kudankulam which is being used on these feeder lines,” said a senior Tangedco official. 
 
 Residents in areas like Adyar, Thiruvanmiyur, Kotturpuram, Alandur and parts of Velachery were forced to sweat it out for more than six hours. “Power was restorted in all areas by 1.30pm after the lines were repaired. Many employees had to walk several kilometers to check the line and find the fault area. That is why it took so long,” he said. 
 
 On Wednesday evening, an overloaded feeder line from Manali to Tondiarpet snapped and several North Chennai areas were without power till Thursday morning.
 
 “Power supply was disrupted in several areas in north and central Chennai since Wednesday evening due to a snag in feeder lines supplying to Tondiarpet substation. Washermenpet, Royapuram, Mannady, Sowcarpet, Chintadripet and Egmore and parts of Anna Salai were affected,” he said. 
 
 A high tension line tripped, affecting supply to the Tondiarpet substation. “In most areas, power was restored by evening.” 
 
 This is the second time this year that feeder lines have tripped in north and south Chennai. On April 27, a line in North Chennai tripped due to high atmospheric temperature and the load shifted to another line, resulting in all lines tripping within a few minutes. The   lines also sagged and tripped leading to blackouts. Last year, on April 30, many areas went without power after the   line tripped.
