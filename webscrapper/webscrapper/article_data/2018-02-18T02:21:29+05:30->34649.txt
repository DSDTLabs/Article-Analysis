Mumbai: Incidents of   with some of them being thrown out are increasing every day and are creating havoc in Mumbai, said the   while   to a “able-bodied” young man who was convicted for pushing a senior citizen out of the train.

 “Commuters in rush hours in local train always feel unsecured due to such instances which are occurring frequently,” said  .
 
 The incident happened in a Kasara-bound fast local around 7.20 pm on January 9, 2015 after it left Dombivli. Mohammed Ansari (then 22), the convict, was travelling in the compartment reserved for handicapped persons and had already picked up an argument with other commuters who objected to his travelling in a reserved compartment.
 
 Nandkumar Joshi, a senior citizen, entered the train at Dombivli and on hearing the arguments, he tried to pacify Ansari. Joshi said Ansari pushed him out of the running train. “The act of pushing the victim out of the train running at a speed of 100 km per hour reflects intention of the applicant (Ansari) as required by section 307 of IPC (attempt to murder).”
 
 The defence said Joshi was a blood pressure patient and fell down as his blood pressure level shot up. The judge did not buy this theory and said two other commuters witnessed the incident. “The incident in question is a serious incident which had endangered the life of the victim. Had he not got the medical treatment immediately, he would have certainly died. Fortunately for him, no other train was running on the opposite track,’’ the court said.
 
 Dismissing the defence argument that it was not verified that the witnesses were carrying tickets to establish they were in the train, the judge said that in criminal cases proof of mathematical precision is not required.
 
 The sessions court had sentenced Ansari to seven years rigorous imprisonment. Releasing the applicant on bail for such serious offence which is proved before the trial court will certainly give a wrong signal to the society.
