Actress-director   has roped in   and   for her next directorial, which she says is a family drama centred on a young, educated couple.

 Says Lakshmy, “I was planning to make a film on the 2015 Chennai floods, but because it was a lot of visual effects, it hasn't taken off yet. And I was impressed with a recent Hindi film and tried to get its remake rights, but that didn't happen either. But watching the film left me inspired, and I wrote an entirely new script following that. While Ashok and   have come on board to play the leads, the other details on the project are yet to be firmed up. Well-known cinematographer Jomon T John has also evinced interest in being part of it, but since he is busy currently with Rohit Shetty's Hindi film, we are looking at how to work together.“
 
 The film, she says, is titled House Owner, and will be a feel-good drama. “Owning a house is a quintessential middle-class dream and this film will be about the challenges that the couple face. But the treatment will be lighthearted,“ she assures.
 
 Meanwhile,   adds that she might do her movie on the floods, too, if things fall in place. “I am hoping to start my next film by September-October. If I manage to get everything ready for the Chennai floods story, I will direct it first, because the script is already locked, and then begin this film in February . Else, I'll do this one first and the other film later. I hope to complete shooting both the films by next June,“ she says.
