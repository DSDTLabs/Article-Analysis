MELBOURNE: When   doesn't want to answer a question her voice drops in decibel level before tapering off and finishing with a shake of her head that signals, 'next question'. It has much the same effect as the superstar American's thunderous serve, perhaps the most dominating shot in the women's game that has gone whizzing past clueless opposition countless times. Next point.

 There was none of that nonchalance or 'I'm not answering that question' petulance, from the 35-year-old, the  's second seed, when asked about her engagement to Reddit co-founder  , which she announced with a rhyming verse that ended with 'I said yes'.
 
 "It's been really great. I've said that from the beginning," a beaming   said of her engagement in her pre-tournament press conference. "I just didn't want to think about it until after Australia. Grand Slams mean a lot to me. I was, like, I'm not going to think about it. It's almost a little unreal right now because I haven't taken it in. I'm being rather selfish and focused on my career."
 
 "It was right in the middle of pre-season," she said of the announcement. "I'm really focused on training, cardio, all kinds of stuff. Now, I'm on the road, already back at work. I don't want to get too happy because I want to stay focused. It was," Serena said, when reminded of the romantic nature of Ohanian's proposal which the American recalled in her verse. "I'm actually just a really good writer, so...," she said keeping with the mood, "If you guys want any tips, I'm around."
