KOLKATA: An 18-year-old   was detained at Kolkata   on Friday morning when he attempted to enter the terminal with a fake e-ticket. On inquiry, it was found that he is scheduled to travel on Saturday, but had edited the date on the e-ticket soft copy to enter the terminal on Friday to see off a friend.

 
 It was the absence of any luggage with the passenger that made the   jawans suspicious when Has Ole Vandre displayed the e-ticket on his cellphone and furnished his passport at departure gate 4A. According to the ticket, he was booked on flight EK-571. The jawan did allow him to enter the terminal but followed him to the Emirates counter to check if he was a bona fide traveller.
 
 The Emirates ground staff checked the ticket PNR and found he was booked on the next day’s flight to Dubai. “There was no passenger booked in his name on Friday.,” a security officer said. On being questioned, Vandre confessed he had edited the soft copy of the e-ticket to enter the terminal. He wanted to see off his friend   who was travelling by the Emirates flight on Friday.
 
 CISF later handed him over to police. A case of forgery and unauthorised entry has been registered. His cellphone that contained the edited e-ticket was also seized and handed over to police. Authorities at the German consulate were also informed. Sources said Vandre would be allowed to take Saturday’s flight.
