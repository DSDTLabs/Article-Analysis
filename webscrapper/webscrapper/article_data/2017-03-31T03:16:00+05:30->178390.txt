Calangute: Construction of the sewerage pipeline network and the sewage treatment plant in Calangute have fallen two years behind schedule. The foundation stone for the two projects were laid by chief minister Manohar Parrikar in February 2013, and both were expected to be completed by March 2015.

 The sewerage system for Calangute was being constructed as the ground water table in the coastal tourism hub was contaminated due to large amounts of sewage being discharged through soak pits by resorts and hotels in Calangute. 
 
 Some hotels clandestinely release raw sewage into open areas, nullahs, fields, and some have even been caught releasing sewage into covered roadside drains.
 
 The then Parrikar-led government had made the  , along with a garbage treatment plant, a priority for the previous government.
 
  But, though a modern garbage treatment plant has come up on the Calangute plateau, construction work of the sewerage network and the sewage treatment plant, work on which had started much before the garbage treatment plant, whose foundation stone was laid in November 2014, still lay incomplete. 
 
 Both the sewerage network and the sewage treatment plant are being financed by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) at a cost of Rs 150 crore.
 
 According to Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, the construction work is in its final stages.
