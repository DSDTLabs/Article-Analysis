  Lalit Peiris said, “We started operations last year. Since then, we have carried nearly 12,000 people to Colombo. Previously, there were three flights a week — Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Now, we will operate on Tuesdays as well.”
 
 “We have seen that the crowd from Kolkata is mainly tourists. So when there is a lean period, the flights are nearly empty. So, we have decided to offer a three-nightsfour-days package for Rs 32,000. Under this package, tourists will have the opportunity to stay in a three star hotel and experience Sri Lanka comfortably,” Peiris added.
 
 “There is also a huge crowd that comes to Kolkata from Sri Lanka. These tourists come mainly to visit the holy places of India. As a result, we are also trying to increase the pilgrimage tour in India. We are hopeful that we will be able to attract tourists from both the countries,” Peiris added.
 
 The airline operates from 14 places in India. “The Kolkata   takes off at 12.30pm and reach Colombo at 3.30pm,” Peiris added.
