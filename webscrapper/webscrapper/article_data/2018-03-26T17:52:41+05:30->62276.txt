NEW DELHI: The Indian National Congress’ (INC) official mobile app ‘With INC’ seems to have disappeared from the Google Play Store, after anonymous   who goes by the moniker Elliot Alderson on Monday alleged that the app was sending users’ personal data to Singapore.

 
 However, the   party's social media head tweeted saying the party app "has been defunct for a while now".
 
 "The URL for membership on the INC ( ) app has been defunct for a while now. Our membership is through the INC website. How difficult is that to understand," tweeted the Congress party's social media head Divya Spandana.
 
 
 
  
  
 On the app being deleted by the Congress, Alderson 
  speaking to ToI, said, “I think they got scared after my first tweet saying that I will look into their app.”
 
 The vigilante hacker on Sunday had put out a message on micro-blogging site Twitter, saying he will publish “interesting details” about the Congress mobile app he’s found, on Monday.
 
  
  
 
 On Monday, Alderson alleged that when a user signs up for the  , her/ his personal data which is not “encrypted” is routed to the app’s servers in Singapore.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Monday’s development comes in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s app -- the NaMo app-- running into trouble for asking its users for a strings of permissions including camera, photographs, location, contacts, and microphone.
 
 
 
 Interestingly, it was Alderson, who had pointed out on Saturday that the   was sharing user data with a third party in the US without the users’ consent.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 On Sunday, the hacker alleged that the NaMo app had “quietly” updated its privacy settings.
 
  
  
 
 Congress President   had earlier in the day urged users to delete the NaMo app.
