NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of Kharghar’s Cidco-developed housing society Gharkul are now facing   woes due to the heavy rains. 

  Around 200 flats have been facing leakage. The buildings have also seen slab falls and cracks on the pillars.
 
 The flats in the 96 buildings were handed over in 2000. The leakage started within five years of the construction being completed, alleged residents. 
 
 “The Gharkul housing society has 96 buildings. Water seepage through electrical conduits has been reported in various buildings,” alleged corporator Nilesh Baviskar who has already complained to Cidco officials. 
 
 Most of the overhead water tanks have been covered with polythene sheets. On August 29, the power supply to one of the buildings was disrupted due to seepage, Baviskar added. 
 
 Gharkul housing federation chairman Gorakhnath Surve said, “We have been following up with Cidco on thecomplaints of seepage and slab falls.”
 
  “The slab in our kitchen suddenly fell off but luckily no one was inside. Cidco has to be blamed for the poor quality of work,” one of the residents said. Another resident Hanuman Shinde alleged, “Most of the buildings with RCC pillar structure have developed cracks. These cracks led to water seepage. Portions of the terrace slab have also started collapsing.”
 
 The residents said that since the area is on lease, it was difficult for the housing societies to take any decision regarding repairs and maintenance. 
 
 The residents have been demanding that Cidco should allow the area to be converted into the freehold category. Cidco PRO Mohan Ninawe said, “The complaints will be looked into. ”
