PALANPUR: Potato growers in north Gujarat are feeding huge quantities of tubers to cattle in gau shalas in  . With prices falling to Rs 2 to Rs 6 per 20 kg and fresh arrivals expected from January 17, the farmers who stocked their produce are now selling the crop in distress.

 President of Cold Storage Owners Association Ganpat Kachhwa said, “We will have 20 lakh bags (each containing 50 kg) lying the 200 cold storages around Deesa. By January 15, the fresh arrival of potatoes would commence. We have no space to accommodate the new arrivals.”
 
 District agricultural officer, (Banaskantha), P K Patel said the area under potato cultivation has increased from 66,170 hectare last year to 78,089 hectare in 2017.” 
 
 Deesa has about 70 per cent of the total products in the state besides Kheda, Mehsana and   districts. 
 
 A potato farmer in Deesa Babu Mali said, “We are ready to sell a 50 kg bag for Rs 40. But there are no buyers. This has been the situation for the last three years.”
 
 Mali said farmers are not even able to recover the transportation costs.
 
 Kachhwa said they are expecting at least 5 crore bags of fresh produce as the atmosphere for potato growing was very congenial. 
 
 “This is only going to cause a glut and aggravate our problem,” member of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sangh’s executive committee Magan Patel said.
