GAYA: A 1984 batch IPS officer AK Upadhyay, now posted as DG, Bihar Police Building Construction Corporation (BPBCC), and a well known   poet, was felicitated at a special function organised in Bodh Gaya on Thursday for his contribution to poetry.

 Upadhyay writes poetry in the pen name of 'Bebak' (frank).
 
 The poem for which he has been honoured is — Police mein aye ho to bhalai bhi karo, Insaf ki khatir ladai bhi karo, mulzimon se pesh ao muhabbat se magar, shaitan ke bachche ki pitai bhi karo (Do some good being a part of police service, fight for justice, treat culprits with compassion and crack the whip on the wicked)”
 
 Introducing the poet cop, former IG MA Kazmi said, “The profile of a cop and a poet was radically different if not divergent. A poet needs a tender heart, while effective policing requires a strict mind. Upadhyay has beautifully bridged this gap by using the right mix of the pen and the baton, pen for writing poetry and baton for effective policing and he has never allowed the cop in him to take the better of the poet or vice versa.”
 
 Recalling the senior cop's somewhat humble origins, Kazmi said Upadhyay’s iconic integrity will continue to inspire the future police officers of the state.
 
 Shabbi Shamsi, the organiser of the felicitation function said the presence of who’s who of Gaya's literary world bore testimony to Upadhyay’s poetic genius. Gaya SSP Garima Malik presented a special memento to the police officer, her former boss in the Bihar Military Police (BMP). Malik recalled him as a hard task master and a forgiving boss.
 
 Replying to the felicitation, Upadhyay said though he never got a field posting in Gaya, the place has given him so much appreciation that he felt truly overwhelmed. He promised to concentrate more on Urdu poetry after his superannuation.
