HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday took strong objection to Andhra Pradesh's stand that it had identified only one MLA who took part in the cockfights during   festivities in West Godavari district in defiance of the court's orders. 

 A bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice K   expressed serious displeasure on the statement made by state's counsel and wondered as to how the government couldn't zero in on the offenders as the event was aired live by several TV channels. Resuming the hearing in a public interest petition (PIL) filed by Kalidindi Ramachandra Raju of Bhimavaram in West Godavari, the bench said that as many as 800 places had been identified where the cockfights were held illegally. 
 
 "I myself saw several politicians claiming openly on national and local TV channels that they will defy court orders on cockfights. We have asked you (state) to get the TV footage and identify the offenders. To say that you could get the name of only one MLA is nothing but making a mockery of our order. There are legislators, MPTCs and ZPTCs who made several claims before the media on Sankranti day," Justice Ramesh said. 
 
 Responding to this, advocate general   sought two weeks from the court to come up with more details. 
 
 "We had issued notices to all TV channels. Only one TV channel has responded and from the footage, we could identify only one MLA", the   defended. 
 
 To this, the bench directed the AG to source footage from all the TV channels. "The question of TV channels not responding to you should not arise or you can leave the matter to us. We will get the footage from the channels and entrust the matter to an independent agency to identify the offenders from the footage," the bench told the AG. 
 
 The bench at one stage said it would direct the director general of police to file a signed report on the progress the state has made in the matter. However, when the AG sought more time, the HC bench adjourned the case by two weeks.
