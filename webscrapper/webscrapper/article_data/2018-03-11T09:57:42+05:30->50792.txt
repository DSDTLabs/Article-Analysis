RAJKOT:   yards held protests on Saturday after they were not able to sell groundnut at minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 900 per 20 kg despite having a token issued by the government. The deadline for procurement of groundnut at   was Friday.

 More than 150 farmers waiting for their turn to sell their groundnut stock at the two market yards shouted slogans against the government and demanded that their produce be procured at MSP.
 
 Amreli APMC chairman Deepak Malani said the arrival of groundnut stock was far beyond the capacity of the market yard to handle. “The labourers and other facility is fixed at the market yard and it can’t increase overnight. There are farmers who have messages in their mobile and waiting since last three days for their turn and all of sudden on Friday evening it was announced that now server has stopped accepting new stock entry because the time limit for procurement set by government is over.” 
 
 He said because of the stringent guidelines set by the government after large-scale malpractices came to light had slowed down the procurement process.
 
 The government had suspended procurement of groundnut on January 19 after the complains of malpractice. However, before that procurement centres had issued token to farmers. The procurement had resumed last month, but only for those farmers who had been issued token earlier.
 
 Farmers also alleged that there was malpractice in sending SMS to farmers giving details of where to take their produce. Some alleged that SMSs were issued to people who had not even registered before January 19.
