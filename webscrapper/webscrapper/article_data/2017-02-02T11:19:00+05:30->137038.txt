PANAJI: India’s preparations for the Fifa Under-17 World Cup later this year has been thrown into disarray as the players have been asked to take a break before resuming training at an unannounced date.
 
  The All India   Federation (AIFF) had officially announced that “the team which has been sent on long exposure tours to Germany, Dubai, Spain, South Africa, Norway, Brazil, Russia among others would resume their practice on February 1, 2017 in Goa.”
  
  However, according to sources, the players have been asked to spend some time at home. Interestingly, the team had arrived in Delhi on January 23 from Russia and spent a week in Delhi doing nothing, apart from watching the Indian Women’s League and a couple of movies.
  
  “The boys are going home now and will start training possibly next week,” a senior official associated with the team told TOI on Wednesday.
  
  Sources said the AIFF booked the artificial-turf ground at Fatorda from Wednesday to resume training, according to the original plan. But with the   saga dragging on for longer than initially expected, the AIFF has been forced to tweak plans.
  
  It is still not clear who will be the interim coach but indications are that former India coach Savio Medeira and AIFF’s head of youth development, Richard Hood, will collectively take a call later this week. Earlier reports that technical director Scott O’Donnell will be the interim coach have proved to be untrue as the former Cambodia coach is serving his notice period and will leave for Australia on February 9.
  
  Adam has been under fire after the players complained of verbal and physical abuse, an allegation the German coach has repeatedly denied.
