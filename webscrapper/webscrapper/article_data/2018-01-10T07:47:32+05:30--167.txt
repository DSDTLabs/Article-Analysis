BENGALURU: Karnataka chief secretary K   has won accolades from none other than Prime Minister  , who described her as a role model for her peers and citizens.

 Addressing the all-India deputy commissioners’ conference recently in New Delhi, Modi said he was inspired by a tweet of a senior IAS officer, who recalled how her small benevolence to a shepherd, some 27 years ago, brought a smile to her face. “Though I cannot recollect her name, such officers should be a role model for others,” Modi said.
 
 Reacting to this, Ratna Prabha told TOI, “I am very happy that the Prime Minister has seen me as a role model, it inspires me to do better work.”
 
 When she was deputy commissioner of Raichur district, Ratna Prabha had helped a shepherd, Narasappa, get admission in school. A few days after she was appointed chief secretary,   came to meet her to tell her how she had given him a leg-up in life.
 
 On January 4, Ratna Prabha had tweeted: “Narasappa of Idapnur village Raichur said he was grazing sheep near a school & I was passing by as DC in my car, stopped called the school teacher & admitted him & now 27 years later he was before me as a constable. came to Thank Me!! Cant believe small actions have lasting results’’. Modi said: “It’s heartening to know this country has such officers. If all officers and lawmakers follow in her footsteps, no one can stop this country from progressing.”
