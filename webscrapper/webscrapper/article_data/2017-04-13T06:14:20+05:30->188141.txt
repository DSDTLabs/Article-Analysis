NEW DELHI: The Manmohan Singh-headed PMO was “evasive” in claiming that delays in generating progress reports on the 2010   were best explained by the sports ministry and its justification for allowing a non-government body to conduct the Games was not convincing, the   of Parliament has concluded.

 “The PMO’s submission that the reasons for delay in generating the monthly progress report can be best explained by the ministry of youth affairs and sports appears evasive at best. The committee is aghast to note that the government stirred into action on August 7, 2006, more than two years after the appointment of chairman, organising committee,” the PAC said in its report on the CWG tabled in Parliament.
 
 Under the chapter “Role and responsibility of the PMO, distortion of the minutes of the first GOM”, the report raised doubts whether the correct record was presented to the then PM   with regard to decisions that led to   heading the CWG organising committee.
 
 “They (committee) observe that while the PM as approving authority of the minutes have every right to amend the minutes, the record of the proceedings would clearly bring to light whether the draft put up to him for approval was a true reflection of the decisions taken during the first GOM or whether the facts were twisted before placing the minutes for his approval,” the reports said.
 
 Though certain references to the Manmohan PMO have been deleted from the report adopted by the PAC, the report is still scathing of its decisions and oversight of the scam-hit event. The PAC slammed the decision to appoint Kalmadi as chairman of the organising committee as “imprudent” and found unconvincing the Manmohan PMO’s claim that it followed the Asian Games model as the 1982 event was in fact de facto organised by the then PMO.
