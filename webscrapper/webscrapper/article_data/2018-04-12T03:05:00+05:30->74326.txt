NAGPUR: Pt Prabhakar   was one of the most persuasive teachers’ I have learned from; he made sure that all his disciples learnt the nuances of music and marched ahead, said Sadhana Shiledar, one of his students, on Tuesday. 

 Shiledar, assistant professor of music at Vasantrao Naik Institute of Arts and Commerce, was participating in a panel discussion on the ways and musical journey of Deshkar, held at  . The programme was organized by   to pay tributes to Deshkar on his death anniversary. 
 
 The discussion, conducted by Renuka Deshkar, highlighted the musical supremacy of the maestro and dwelt upon music in today’s era. 
 
 Talking about the musical ‘overtunes’ practised by the present generation, vocalist Chitra Modak said, “Music is an art that can be practised only if you are firm to learn and practice. Until you absorb the finer details of the art and imply it, your learning will be incomplete.” 
 
 Comparing the music teachers then and now, Snehal Paldhikar, principal of Smt Binzani Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Mahal, said, “Teachers today cannot be compared with those during our days. Today, a teacher is seen to be quivering with uncertainty with his own knowledge, rather than being confident about it. While teaching us, Deshkar used to be deeply involved in the process, right from rolling down the mattresses till the completion of recitals, and it helped us immensely to grow as musicians.” 
 
 The discussion concluded with the panellists drawing the conclusion that concept-based reality events should be organized to show the beauty of classical music which will also bring to fore many gems in the field. 
 
 The discussion was followed by a melodious presentation of songs by Pune-based classical singer and a voice-over artiste Shilpa Puntambekar. Her recital of various songs based on raag Bhoop left the audience sway their heads.
