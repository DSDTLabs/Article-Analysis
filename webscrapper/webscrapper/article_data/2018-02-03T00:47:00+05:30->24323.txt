Jaipur: At Jawaja in Ajmer and Bhim in Rajsamand, workers associated with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) met in large numbers to speak of their problems. It was on February 2, 2006, that   was first implemented in 200 districts of the country. Friday, thus, marked the 12th anniversary of the launch of this programme. People sought not just 100 days as at present, but 200 days of work to each household under the Act. Many complained that even 100 days had become hard to get, in recent years. 

 At Jawaja, villagers from Surdiya and Taragarh gram panchayats said no work was being undertaken under this programme, leaving people in distress. Susheela Bai, a social activist, who addressed the gathering, said the rural jobs programme worked well for a few years after it was first implemented, helping people pull themselves out of poverty while creating assets locally.
 
 The people later went to the office of the local development officer and submitted a list of demands, including providing work under the Act promptly. Under the Act, anyone applying for work should be provided work within 15 days of the application. If this is not done, the government ought to pay applicants a small percentage of the wages under the Act as compensation for not providing work. This, however, is rarely done and the marchers on Friday demanded that these provisions of the Act be properly implemented.
 
 The people demanded better work conditions for women cooking meals at government schools. Minimum wages in the state must be raised to at least Rs 300, and work should be guaranteed to each household not just for 100 days a year, but 200 days.
