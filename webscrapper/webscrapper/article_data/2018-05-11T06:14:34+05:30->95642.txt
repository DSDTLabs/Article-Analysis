AHMEDABAD:   police arrested four persons —  , Bhavik Patel, Krishna Patel and Ajay Chauhan — all residents of Ajay Tenements, for severely beating up a Vadodara-based travel agent, Akshay Patel, which lead to his death. 

 The beating was precipitated by the deceased’s alleged molestation of Kamlesh Patel’s wife.
 
 Kamlesh Patel and the others had handed over Akshay Patel to Amraiwadi police. “We rushed Akshay Patel to hospital twice, as he had been beaten up badly. He succumbed to his injuries when he was being taken to hospital the second time,” said inspector Odhar Desai of Amraiwadi police station.
 
 According to police sources, the very same day, the woman who was allegedly molested, also ingested poison in a bid to commit suicide.
 
 According to police sources, Kamlesh Patel’s wife had met Akshay Patel because she wanted to go to Malaysia on a work permit.
 
 “She had paid Akshay Patel Rs 12,000 to Patel to get her marriage certificate and passport issued. Patel had demanded another Rs 30,000 to get a visa for her. Patel had come to her house to collect the money,” added Desai.
 
 When the woman went to get a glass of water for Patel and picked up her mobile to call Kamlesh, who run a DJ business, for the money, Patel allegedly grabbed her from behind and asked her for sexual favours, said a police source. Police said that on hearing the woman’s cries for help, locals and Krishna Patel, who works with her husband, rushed into the house and caught Akshay Patel. “Kamlesh Patel also rushed home upon being told about the incident. They confined Akshay Patel to a room and beat him up. They then handed over Akshay Patel to us,” said a police official.
