PATNA: State   chief Nityanand Rai on Tuesday termed PM Narendra Modi as the “messiah of the poor”, who has made a permanent place for himself in the hearts and minds of the downtrodden people.

 “Today, the poor in the country believe that only PM Modi can ensure development for them,” Rai said at a function organised by the state BJP to celebrate the achievements of Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre. Senior party functionaries, including state vice-president Devesh Kumar and spokesmen Rajib Ranjan and Sanjay Singh Tiger were also present.
 
 Rai said despite launching a false propaganda against the PM, the opposition parties were not in a position to dislodge him from the helms of the country’s affairs. “The PM is unassailable. No one can stop his march by spreading rumours or making false charges against him,” Rai said.
 
 Asked why CM Nitish Kumar, who heads the NDA government in the state, has so far not issued any statement to laud the achievements of Modi government at the Centre, Rai said the former would take part in a joint celebration to be organised by the state unit of NDA on June 7.
 
 The BJP functionaries said Jan Dhan Yojana, construction of low cost toilets, Mudra Yojana, PM Awas Yojana, PM Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana and the budgetary allotment of Rs 95,000 crore for the uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes were some of the major achievements of the Centre.
