HYDERABAD: IVF centres that follow the procedures laid down by the   ( ) feel commercial surrogacy should be banned. 

 "Only a childless couple knows the pain of not having a baby. When technology makes it possible for them to become parents through surrogacy, why should they be denied that?" asks P Jyotsna  , a patient counsellor at Dr Padmaja Fertility (IVF) Centre, Habsiguda, in the city.
 
 "The authorities can very well find out where illegal activities are taking place and take action against such centres and agents," she adds.
 
 One of the main provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in November, is to prevent the exploitation of women. The bill states that except for medical treatment, the surrogate should not be paid anything. In ART centres that adhere to the norms, the surrogate mother does not get paid either by the hospital or any agent. 
 
 "The issue goes beyond money. Ultimately, a childless couple having a baby through surrogacy is a joy that only they can explain. Why should they be deprived of that joy?" Reddy says, on asking why she would rent her womb for nine months. Meanwhile, some online petitions have also been started to urge the government not to put an end to commercial surrogacy.
 
 In a petition started on April 25, Divakar   says that instead of the clause on only blood relatives standing in as surrogate, the bill should also include friends and others. 
 
 Another online petition argues that "if there are faults with the system, it needs to addressed by thoroughly regulating fertility clinics offering surrogacy services... Banning surrogacy is not the answer, it will simply drive the practice underground".
