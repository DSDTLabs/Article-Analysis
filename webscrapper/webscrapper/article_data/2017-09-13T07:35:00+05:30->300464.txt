Gurgaon:   officials are yet to receive any orders on the closing down of liquor vends within 400 metres of schools across   as announced by   in Gurgaon on Sunday. Meanwhile, more parents have complained of liquor vends near city schools.

 “As of now there is no communication in the matter and even if they do plan to shut down liquor vends within 400 metres of schools, it will have to be done through a change in the state excise policy,” a senior official at the department of excise and taxation, Gurgaon, told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 Sharma had made the announcement after parents raised concerns over the presence of a liquor vend just outside Ryan International School, Bhondsi. Ever since parents have been reporting of liquor vends near schools across the city.
 
 “Liquor shops can be seen near so many schools in Gurgaon. There is one right outside a reputed school in Sector 52 on St Thomas Marg near the Ardee City red light. I had even sent the pictures to the district administration for action against the vend, but nothing has happened so far,” said a concerned mother of two school-going girls, who did not wish to be named.
 
 Another liquor vend was spotted near a school in Sector 38 close to Medanta hospital. However the excise officials said that all the liquor vends in the city are as per the law which mandates 150 metres of distance between liquor sale point and the gate of a school, a temple or a hospital. 
 
 They also said that reallocation of liquor vends will prove to be a big challenge. “We have already had a lot of trouble with the allocation of vends this year due to the Supreme Court’s highway ban. And there have been multiple protests against allocation of vends near schools, religious institutes and in residential areas,” said an official. “However, if orders are issued, we will comply,” he assured.
