Nagpur: Indian Institute of Management Nagpur (IIM-N) is conducting a survey on Metro Rail fare structure as directed by the Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Limited (NMRCL). Students of the institution have prepared an online questionnaire for getting citizensâ€™ feedback.

 The questionnaire contains fare structures of Bengaluru, Pune and Mumbai metros and asks the respondent to mention how much minimum and maximum fare he or she is willing to pay. A comparison of all the Metro fares shows that ticket of Nagpur Metro Rail, as per the detailed project report (DPR), is costlier than the other three.
 
 For example, the fare for 0-2 km of Bengaluru Metro for 2016-17 is Rs 10. The proposed fare of Pune Metro in 2018-19 is Rs 13 while that for Mumbai in 2019-20 is Rs 11. The minimum fare for Nagpur Metro for 2018-19 as per DPR is Rs 15. 
 
 The maximum fare of Bengaluru Metro is Rs 42 for 17-18 km. The same for Pune Metro is Rs 45 for above 30 km while that of Mumbai Metro is Rs 37 for above 35 km. The maximum fare of Nagpur Metro is Rs 41 for above 21 km.
 
 The fares for Nagpur Metro were calculated by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on the basis of Delhi Metro fares in 2009. They were escalated at the rate of 15% every two years to arrive at the initial fare structure for Nagpur Metro. 
 
 It is imperative for NMRCL to keep the fares low otherwise not many people in Nagpur, who are habituated to commuting by their personal vehicles, will use it.
