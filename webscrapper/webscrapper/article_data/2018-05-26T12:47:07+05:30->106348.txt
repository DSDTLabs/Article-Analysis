MADURAI : A one-day workshop on ‘Creating Safe Networks for Walking and Cycling’ jointly organised by the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration,   and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) was held on Friday. A large number of officials including Madurai Corporation commissioner   took part.

 In the workshop it was urged to identify and design streets that cater to the requirements of all users, particularly pedestrians and cyclists. Although there is a considerable population in the city who walk and peddle for their daily needs, the facilities available for them was starkly inadequate.
 
 Officials informed that according to 2011 census, a whopping 44% of road users are pedestrians and cyclists. But the dearth of pedestrian and cycling infrastructure undermines their basic civil right.
 
 It was also informed in the workshop that to cater to the needs of the residents, 10 km of streets has been identified under the smart city scheme to be transformed into smart streets. The streets include Chitrai Street, Avani Moola Street, Masi Street and Veli Street. The city has also identified a heritage walk to facilitate convenient movement of tourists and locals.
 
 An official said that engineers from the corporation have studied the characteristics of Madurai roads and accident prone spots. The issues would be addressed under the smart city project, the official added.
