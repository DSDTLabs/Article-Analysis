With UP government allocating Rs 288 crore for   rail projects in the state, Lucknow Metro — whose priority section is ready for commercial run any time in July — has received a lion’s share of Rs 233 crore. Sources told TOI that this is the last instalment for Lucknow Metro the from state government’s coffer under equity. It has already paid over Rs 1,000 crore to the project in the past two years. 

 Metro officials said, “Since Central funding came in late, project’s earlier expenses were met out only by the state government. We had requested for last instalment of Rs 233 crore this year, which hopefully has been sanctioned and approved in this  .” The remaining   of Rs 55 crore will go to five other metro-rail projects in UP which are in advanced stage of planning — Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad and Gorakhpur. 
 
 While DPRs are already complete and sent to the government for approval for Kanpur and Varanasi metro, corridors in Allahabad and Gorakhpur have recently been finalised. 
 
 In 2017, the Centre has released about Rs 446 crore and state had to give Rs 233 crore. Lucknow Metro officials said that the allocation would help complete the project timely by March 2019. 
 
 “Since all tenders on North-South corridor have been issued, the fund will help in making faster payments to our contractors — be it coaches, signalling, underground section or second elevated stretch from KD Singh Babu Stadium to Munshipulia.”
