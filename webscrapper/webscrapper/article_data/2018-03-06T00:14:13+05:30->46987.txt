Pune: The civic body plans to go ahead with the Taljai hill-Sinhagad Road   project after a detailed study despite stiff opposition from citizens.

  As of now, the civic body does not have any map or plan on the detailed alignment of the tunnel and the points from where it will start and end. 
 
 Officials on Monday said the Pune Municipal Corporation will appoint a consultant to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and the plan will be chalked out on its basis. 
 
 The project aims at providing a direct access between Sahakarnagar and Sinhagad Road and was announced by PMC’s standing committee chairman Muralidhar Mohol in the 2018-19 civic budget. The committee allotted Rs 2 crore for the project and the funds are likely to be utilized for appointing the consultant firm and preparing the DPR.
 
 “The DPR will focus on the alignment of the tunnel, approach roads, environment impact assessment and project feasibility,” an official said. 
 
 Residents of Sahakarnagar, who had submitted about 4,000 objections to the project when it was mooted in the 2013 development plan, feared that it would lead to destruction of the biodiversity-rich Taljai Waghjai hill complex.
