Even as the controversy surrounding anchor-turned -actress  's protest against the casting couch menace in the Telugu film industry rages on, character artiste   who has been supporting Reddy in her fight, has now accused film critic Mahesh Kathi of sexually assaulting her. Speaking to a television channel, Sunitha said that Mahesh Kathi had forced himself on her and attempted to rape her at his residence. 

 "I know Mahesh Kathi through Facebook and after watching him on  , I called him up to congratulate him. He then invited me to his house and to my surprise, he asked me if I will give commitment. When I refused, he locked the door behind him and sexually assaulted me," Sunitha alleged. 
 
 In a strong rebuttal, Mahesh Kathi stated that the allegations against him were totally false and threatened to take legal action against Sunitha. "Let her show me the proof and I am ready to go the police station with her. These are completely false allegations and I will take legal action against her," Kathi said. 
 
 The film critic later took to Twitter to reiterate his intentions. "I will be filing a defamation case against Sunitha for falsely accusing me of sexual harassment and   for instigating her (sic)," he posted on Twitter.
