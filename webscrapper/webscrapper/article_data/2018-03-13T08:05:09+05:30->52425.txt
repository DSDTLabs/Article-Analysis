NAGPUR: Continuing its tough stand on lawyers pleading for the government, the Nagpur bench of   on Monday came down heavily on the   asking why it needed such a big number of counsels. HC orally directed the department to justify the distribution of such a big numbers of lawyers at its Nagpur and Aurangabad benches.

 While appointing senior counsel Sunil   as amicus curiae, Justice   asked the Law and   whether it could stop fresh appointment of the lawyers pleading for the government or renewing terms of existing ones till next hearing scheduled after two weeks.
 
 He directed Manohar to go through appraisal reports of additional and assistant government pleaders (AGPs) and public prosecutors (APPs), earlier submitted by the department’s principal secretary through government pleader (GP) on an affidavit. The GP however refused to share the affidavit with media terming it as “confidential”. A copy usually kept with the HC’s Criminal Section was also removed by the GP’s office to avoid a leak.
 
 HC pointed out that Nagpur had 58 government lawyers on its panel, while Aurangabad had 52, despite the fact that latter had more than double the number of cases. The judge also stated Nagpur had seven AGPs, compared to just a couple in Aurangabad.
 
 The court’s directives came while hearing a criminal appeal filed by Balaji Kinhale from Pusad. On Wednesday, HC had sought appraisal reports of AGPs after being irked over their inability in assisting the court or filing replies. 
 
 The judge asked the secretary to clarify whether the performance of GPs, AGPs and APPs, was subjected to periodic assessments and/or appraisals, whether it was found satisfactory, and if not whether the remedial measures were taken.
