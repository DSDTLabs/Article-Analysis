Panaji: Parents of the students studying at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) of Valpoi have decided to pray for an early hearing of the writ petition they had filed last year in the high court of Bombay at Goa. The parents, in the petition, have asked for interim orders to be given for repair of the existing school building and for provision of emergency services. The parents also stated that the school building is in a “very poor state, endangering the lives of the students”. The JNV in Valpoi was established in 1987, operating from a police training school building. The state government later handed over 1lakh sq m of land in Marsodem to set up the school. The school was shifted to its new complex in the academic year 1997-98.  Soon, a private party filed a civil suit, claiming ownership to the property which was now in the school’s possession. In 2005, the case was ruled in favour of the private party. Both, the Union of India and the Goa government, appealed this judgement in the high court, and accordingly, the high court ordered a status quo on construction activities in the disputed property. “This stay order lead to the school complex becoming totally inhabitable and unsafe,” states the writ petition filed by the parents in the high court in 2016. “The petition has been admitted, but it has not come up for final hearing. We are now going to ask for an early hearing,” advocate S N Joshi, representing the parents, told TOI. In their petition filed last year, the parents prayed to the court to “direct constitution of a high powered committee to identify an alternate suitable land in a radius of around 8km from the existing school complex for the purpose of shifting Navodaya Vidhyalaya and submit a report to this court within two weeks or any other time frame that may be fixed by this court.”  They have also prayed that interim relief be provided by allowing repairs to the buildings till the school can be shifted to a new location.
