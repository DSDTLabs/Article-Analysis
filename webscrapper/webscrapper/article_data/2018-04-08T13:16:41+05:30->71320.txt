NAGPUR: Owners of the restaurant at a   building which was set on fire by business rivals have asked the Sitabuldi police why no complaint was registered against all five arsonists when CCTV images clearly showed them entering the building. However, footages showed only four exiting. Three of them are absconding and one has been arrested.

 Following a fresh complaint, the cops said they will make fresh investigations to identify the fifth person. Senior PI Hemant   told TOI that the complainants had mentioned only four persons. “We will look into the footages again,” he said.
 
 Owners of the restaurant Arjun Chhabra and Pawan Nirbhan with the help of Sitabuldi police had obtained CCTV footages from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and adjacent buildings. TOI also has the footages.
 
 It can clearly be seen that five persons in two groups — 2 and 3 — had entered the under-construction building in the wee hours of March 12. However, only four can be seen fleeing towards Times Square on West High Court (WHC) Road. This was pointed out in TOI’s report on March 16 too.
 
 It raises a big question on the Sitabuldi police’s investigation. Chhabra and Nirbhan along with their parents have also met Kharabe and PSI Nitin Vitole asking them to trace the fifth person.
 
 Sitabuldi police had arrested Roshan Shaikh on March 29 in dramatic fashion at the airport. An offence was registered against Shaikh, Ashutosh Mundhada (32), Irfan Khan (26) and Wajid Khan (26).
 
 According to Chhabra and Nirbhan, Mundhada had planned the arson. “He was upset after we got the franchisee of a reputed restaurant brand for which he was trying for a long time,” they said.
 
 The fire did not claim live but Chhabra and Nirbhan suffered huge property loss.
