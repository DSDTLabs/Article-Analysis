“It all happened so quickly, in the last week of the year. In fact, I was officially on board this project on December 31, 2017, when I finished the final talks with the makers,” says Mayuri, who begins shooting for the film this week. Apparently, it was Jaggesh who recommended Mayuri for the character. “I am thrilled to be working with Jaggesh sir, who is a living legend. I got to learn from the director that it was Jaggesh sir who said that I am the only one who would fit this role, and referred my name. It is a big honour,” adds Mayuri.
 The actress will be essaying the role of a journalist. “This character appealed to me because she has prominence in the story. She is someone who keeps changing jobs, because that’s her nature. she gets involved in the central plot when she lands a job as a journalist,” says Mayuri.
