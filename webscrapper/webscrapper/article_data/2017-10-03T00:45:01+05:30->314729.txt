MUMBAI: A new circular issued by the ministry of minority affairs for pre- and postmatric scholarships for minority girl students is drawing flak as it allegedly complicates the process of filling applications.

 The circular issued on September 4, 2017, by the ministry-run  , makes it mandatory for the students to submit the income certificate of their parents/guardian issued by the competent authority.
 
 Till last year, the applicants were just asked to submit a self-declaration regarding the income.
 
 “Various states issue income certificates in their respective regional languages. Self-declaration of income certificate was enough as this could easily be made in English or Hindi as the norms demand. The new norm has been deliberately introduced to discourage minority students from seeking scholarship,” said former   minority affairs minister Arif Naseem Khan.
 
 Khan has written to several authorities, including   minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas   regarding the issue.
 
 The former minister argued that income certificates, like in Maharashtra, are issued through online software which is available only in Marathi language.
 
 “Minority girl students complained about this hurdle recently when our volunteers were helping them fill the application forms. The government gives good slogans like ‘Beti padhao, beti bachao’ but moves like these will discourage many betis from seeking monetary incentives for education,” he said.
 
 However, Naqvi clarified that income certificates issued by different states would be valid. “I don’t think this should be a hindrance. I will look into it and, if an amendment in the conditions laid down is required, we will do it,” Naqvi told TOI.
 
 The foundation gives a scholarship of Rs 5,000 to minority girls who score moraks of 50% and above in Class IX and X examinations and Rs 6,000 in Class XI and XII examinations.
 
 The last date for submission of applications is November 15, 2017.
