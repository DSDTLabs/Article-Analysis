GURUGRAM: Tension gripped Sohna’s   village after 100kg of “cow meat”— later it turned out to be that of buffalo after the test — was seized by cops from a pick-up van on Thursday morning.

 Police and the villagers, however, have different versions of how the whole episode of the seizure unfolded.
 
 According to police, after receiving a tip off that “cow meat being transported in a pick-up van” was passing through the area, cops at the Nimoth police post set up barricades on   road near the village to nab the three people, who were reportedly transporting the meat from Delhi’s Ghazipur area towards Gurgaon.
 
 Locals, however, have a different story to tell. According to them, the trio, who was transporting the meat, crashed into another pick-up van. Soon after, stench started emanating from the vehicle. Around 100-150 of villagers surrounded the accident spot, to check what was being transported in the van. Soon, the trio fled.
 
 “We got suspicious after the men fled and decided to call the police,” said Kapil, a resident of Kherli Lala.
 
 According to Ram Niwas, the sarpanch, the villagers informed the police about the incident, who, in turn, took half an hour to reach the spot.
 
 Police, on the other hand, have been claiming that they seized the meat after intercepting the van. 
 
 The FIR filed by investigating officer   states that a barricade was set up on the spot. The police team spotted the van speeding, and chased it. The van then collided into another pick-up van coming from Ballabhgarh side in the opposite direction. Taking advantage of the crowd that gathered at the spot, the trio managed to flee.
 
 The FIR, filed under sections 229 (rash driving), 336 (endangering life and personal safety of others), 427(punishment for mischief causing damage), 429 (mischief by killing or maiming animals), also states that the veterinary surgeon confirmed it to be  .
