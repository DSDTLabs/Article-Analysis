New Delhi: An   has been lodged against five students of  , including three members of the Student’s Union, by the university administration for removing   from the campus’ Brahmaputra hostel and for misbehaving with security officials.

 On March 31, Mohit Pandey, president of JNUSU, along with other members and inhabitants of the hostel, decided to remove the cameras to “reject the move to put surveillance mechanism,” in spite the administration’s claims that this act would amount to contempt of court due to “the court order to install cameras at all important public places.”
 
 Pandey said the installation of cameras was “undemocratic” as “the proposals have been rejected at various general body meetings (GBM) and hostel meetings.” 
 
 He also took a jibe at the high cost of   cameras mentioned in the FIR. However, the   Registrar Pramod Kumar called it a routine process of increasing security in the campus.
 
  The Registrar also said, “there is no attempt at increasing surveillance in the campus.This is a standard procedure.”
