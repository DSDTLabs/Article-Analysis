VARANASI: Police on Wednesday recovered the remains of a 70-year-old woman from UP’s  , whose body had been preserved by her sons — since her death on January 13 — to avail the family pension she had been receiving after her husband passed away in 2000.

 
 The Kabirnagar-based woman,  , was receiving a family pension of Rs 40,000 per month after her husband   — a custom superintendent — died 18 years ago. However, after Amaravati’s death, her sons embalmed her body using chemicals and stored it in a room of their house to continue receiving the pension.Over time, neighbours became suspicious as the family never allowed anyone to enter their house. “Upon receiving information, we raided the house on Wednesday and found Amaravati’s body. Ink stains on her thumb indicated that thumb impressions had been taken repeatedly to claim family pension,” said Bhelupur inspector  . “The body was sent for postmortem and the house was sealed,” he added.
 
 Amaravati had five sons and three daughters, of whom, two sons and daughters are married. All five sons are unemployed. “We are interrogating the family members,” added Srivastava.
