Trimming eyebrows is thought to be a woman thing. But with the rise of the metrosexual man, it is becoming a regular grooming regimen for men too. Agreed, this is a rather painful exercise, but if done right it can leave you with beautiful shaped brows that can change the way you look. Because well-trimmed brows can enhance your look. However, one done badly can have the opposite effect. 

 While brow trimming is not rocket science, it needs expertise. Keep in mind that eyebrows once trimmed, look shabby once they grow back. So, you have to keep at it. Here’s what to keep in mind when trimming your rows... 
 
 
 
 Do not ever consider trimming your eyebrows if you don’t know what shape you want them to be. You need to have a good idea about the brow shape that will look good on your face and accordingly instruct the expert. 
 
 
 Men should trim their eyebrows to give their forehead/face a clean look. The thumb rule is that it should look groomed and not plucked to a point that it is too thin. Even women don’t like thin brows, now! Keep a definite shape in mind. Ask for a suggestion from the salon expert on what’d suit you – they are usually clued in. twe
 
 
 
 Sometimes, trimming eyebrows can cause red boils and other infections and allergies. Make sure your skin is tough enough to handle the constant pulling and threading. If your skin is too sensitive then you need to avoid trimming at all costs. A badly shaped eyebrow is better than a forehead full of big, red splotches. 
 
 
 
 You can choose how you wish to trim your eyebrows. You can either wax it or trim it depending on what your pain threshold is. Remember the popular Friends episode where Joey gets only one brow trimmed because of the pain! Always follow up the process with a cool pack/astringent to soothe the skin.
