NEW DELHI: Joined at the head since   and recently separated in a landmark surgery at  , Odisha   Jaga and   are likely to be discharged next month. Sources said the twins had recuperated well after surgery.

 “Jaga is taking normal feed. He is healthier. Kalia is little weak. He is on mechanical ventilation, which will be removed in March. After that, we plan to discharge both of them,” a senior doctor said. The twins, nearly three years old now, were admitted to AIIMS in July where doctors separated them in a surgery conducted in two phases.
 
 Twins joined at the head are rare, occurring once in 25 million live births; it is even rarer for them to share the vein carrying blood back from the brain to the heart. Worldwide, there had been few successful surgeries to separate such twins, doctors said. 
 
 They added that both were doing fine till now and the   government, which was funding their treatment, planned to take them to their home state where local doctors would continue to monitor the health of the twins. “We have ordered helmets for both. It will protect their head from damage in case of a fall,” doctors said.
 
 Health and family welfare minister of Odisha, Pratap Jena, confirmed that the twins would return to Odisha and the state government was making preparations for their treatment in the state. 
 
 Last year, the Odisha government had sanctioned Rs 1 crore from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMRF) for the twins’ treatment. “As overstay in hospital may cause infection, we are considering shifting   and Kalia to Bhubaneswar from New Delhi,” Jena added. He said a five-member doctors’ team from Odisha would soon visit AIIMS.
