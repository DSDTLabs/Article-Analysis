 Sangam (Allahabad): In order to pressure the Narendra Modi government to bring legislation in Parliament for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has decided to launch a decisive campaign, Ram Mahotsav across the country, starting this Ram Navami. This is for the first time that the   has set a deadline for starting Ram temple movement.
 
 A decision in this regard was taken by VHP’s central decision-making body, ‘Marg Darshak Mandal’, at its annual meeting at Magh Mela in Allahabad here on Tuesday. The saints and VHP leaders were unanimous in their decision for such a campaign. 
 
 The meeting was presided over by Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and attended by president of supreme governing body of akharas, ‘Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad’, Mahanat Narendra Giri, VHP general secretary Champat Rai and organisation secretary Dinesh among others.
 
 “The VHP will pursue Ram Mahotsav agressively at each village and in urban localities to mobilise people for construction of the Ram temple from Ram Navmi this year. This will be our answer to the Modi government if it fails to make a law for construction of Ram temple,” said Mahant Nritya Gopal Das.
 
 Mahant Narendra Giri said the campaigns would be different from the ‘Ram Shobha Yatras’ which they took out earlier for construction of the temple.
