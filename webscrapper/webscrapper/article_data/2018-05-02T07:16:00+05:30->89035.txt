GHAZIABAD: A “code word” given by a mother to her 12-year-old daughter to seek from a stranger who approached her saved the child from probably being trafficked on Sunday evening. 

 The girl, who lives in Parsavnath Majestic Floors in  , had gone to a shop just outside the society compound to buy a packet of chips when a stranger approached her and apparently told her that her father had met with an accident. Told to accompany him, the girl, a student of Class VII, asked the man for the “code word” that her father should have conveyed had he wanted her to come. 
 
 The man was flustered with the little girl’s response and fled before she could raise an alarm. The girl’s father is a software engineer and her mother a homemaker. The couple have two daughters (aged 17 and 12) and a son (7). 
 
 Wary of cases of abduction and other crimes involving children, the couple had developed the “code word” system for their children and would change them every month. 
 
 “My wife keeps a close watch on our children and regularly gives them lessons in self-defence and how to behave in difficult situations. Until now, I did not pay much heed to the code words and many a times forgot the password she would give to me. But it proved to be a lifesaver,” the father said. 
 
 Asked about the code words, the 12-year-old girl said: “The password could be anything, like the name of gods or a small phrase. We have been told to use them in cases of relatives and neighbours when our parents are not with us.”
 
 The girl’s mother was all praise for her daughter. “Giving a lesson is one thing and using it in an unexpected situation is another. I am very proud of my daughter and will urge every parent to develop similar internal communication systems,” she said.
 
 The girl’s family has not filed any formal complaint about the incident. “We will initiate action whenever we receive a complaint,” said SHO (Indirapuram) Sachin Malik..
