Mysuru: Prime Minister   will declare open the Bengaluru-Mysuru railway electrification line later in the month.

 The PM is likely to launch the project after mid-January, sources told TOI. Also, he is expected to launch two trains — Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU) and Humsafar Express — between Mysuru and Bengaluru.
 
 At present, 26 trains operating between Mysuru and Bengaluru daily carry some 30,000 passengers. Electrification is set to reduce travel time between the cities by 15 minutes, opening a window to ramp up rail traffic and extend existing routes.
 
 Sources said the railway authorities have zeroed in on Maharaja’s College Grounds for the launch of the project — possibly January 5 or 6 — but it’s highly unlikely as the Prime Minister’s Office is yet to confirm it.
 
 Mysuru MP Pratap Simha told TOI: “I’ve requested the PM to inaugurate the double line and electric train in Mysuru. The PMO is working on the schedule. The PM is leaving for Davos on January 24 on a four-day visit. We are urging him to inaugurate the project before the Davos trip.”
 
 New Humsafar Express coaches arrived at the KR Nagar railway station on Sunday. These coaches are likely to be used for long-distance routes. The railway authorities are discussing whether Humsafar Express should operate from Mysuru to Delhi or to Thiruvananthapuram.
 
 The MEMU train that runs from Bengaluru to Ramanagaram will be extended to Mysuru. Besides this, Humsafar Express will operate between Mysuru and Bengaluru.
 
 Late last week, the authorities conducted MEMU train trial between Bengaluru and Mysuru, and the train did the run in two and a half hours. Like a passenger train, the 20-coach MEMU train will stop at all stations.
