JAIPUR: In a fresh twist to the   hit-and-run case, the Jaipur police have registered a case against a forensic expert of the state forensic science laboratory (FSL) for allegedly changing blood samples of the accused. The FSL had stunned the police when it contradicted the police's claim and said that Maharia was not drunk when he ran over three people in a speeding   on July 2.

  assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Jag   informed TOI that a case has been registered against Dr   for changing the blood samples. "We have lodged a case against Dr Jain after an inquiry by the home department indicated discrepancies and found his involvement evident in the matter," he said. 
 
 
 
 
 The Jaipur police have booked the FSL expert under relevant sections of the IPC, including cheating and destruction of evidence.
 
 “We lodged the case only when the home department’s report indicated contradictions in the FSL report,” an official said, adding that other people who aided Dr Jain in allegedly shielding Maharia may also be booked.
 
 “Dr Jain has been booked. But if we find out the involvement of other people during investigation, then we may name others in the FIR too,” said an official.
 
 Siddharth is the son of independent legislator from Fatehpur (Sikar) Nand Kishore Maharia, whose BMW car was involved in an accident that claimed three lives.
 
 The Jaipur police had claimed that Siddharth was in an inebriated condition and driving the vehicle when the accident took place. Police had also produced the video footage of Siddharth and his friends drinking at a hotel to support their claim.
