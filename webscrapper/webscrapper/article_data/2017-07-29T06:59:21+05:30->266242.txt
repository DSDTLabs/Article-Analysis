CHENNAI: Panic gripped the residence of former chief minister   at Venus Colny in Alwarpet on Friday after police seized a mysterious object which looked like country-made   near his house. Police sent it to a forensic laboratory for examination.

 On Friday morning, a man who came to clean the house, found an object which appeared like a bomb wrapped in polythene cover and informed police. Cops who rushed to the scene with a bomb disposal squad, inspected the suspicious object. Initial examination revealed that it was a ball that was filled with mud and pins to make it a look like a bomb.
 
 “We have sent the object to a forensic laboratory to find out whether it was an explosive,” said an investigating officer. A case has been registered and police are conducting inquiring into the incident. “We are collecting CCTV footages and are trying to find out those who had dumped the object,” the officer said.
 
 Supporters of the AIADMK ( ) leader suspected the hand of their rivals, in a bid to scare them. Sources said   was not in his residence when the incident happened. He was in his native Periakulam and is likely to come to Chennai on Sunday.
