PATNA: The   (BIT-P) discontinued Bachelor of Architecture ( ) course for the second consecutive year after it failed to get the affiliation from the   (CoA). 

 CoA is a statutory body of the government of India under the Architect Act, 1974 that grants licence for practice to architecture students after they complete their course.
 
 A student of the 2013-18 batch said she had applied for training at few architectural firms, but feared that her application would be rejected.
 
 “Because of BIT-P’s fault, we are in trouble. I cannot start my own firm as it will not be legal without CoA licence,” a student said on condition of anonymity.
 
 The BArch course was started at BIT-P in 2012 and the first batch passed out in 2017. The affiliation of CoA expired in 2015 and emergency affiliation was given to the institute till 2016. As the institute was not able to fulfil the criteria for the recognition of the course, the CoA derecognized it in 2016. Later, students stage protests against the institute administration.
 
 Another BArch student said, “We had called off our stir after receiving written assurance from vice-chancellor M K Mishra that all our problems would be sorted out. However, nothing has happened so far.”
 
 BArch head Anamika Nandan told this newspaper the BIT-P authorities were in talks with the officials of CoA to provide licence to students, who completed their course. “A   team will soon inspect the institute,” she said.
