GHAZIABAD: A Class VI girl student disappeared from her house in  ,  , under mysterious circumstances on Monday.

 The missing girl has been identified as Archie Yadav (12), a student of Vansthali Public School, Vaishali, Sector 4,  . Archie went missing after returning home around 2.30pm on her own when her mother Sudha Yadav could not pick her up at the bus stop. Sudha still had to go to fetch Archie’s elder sister Pallavi from her school bus stop, which is about 500 metres from the house.
 
 According to the girl’s father Subhash Yadhav, Sudha got slightly delayed in getting back home with Pallavi, because her school bus was late. “As she was waiting for Pallavi, my wife had called Archie in the following 15 minutes to let her know about the delay,” Subhash said.
 
 But when Sudha returned, she saw the door of the house locked from outside with the keys lying on the staircase nearby. When she entered the house and couldn't find Archie, she first searched for her and then Subhash around 3.05pm.
 
 A CCTV camera installed at the building’s staircase shows the girl leaving the house in her regular attire, crying and running in the direction opposite to that of her bus stop. 
 
 The police are not ruling out the possibility of kidnapping and an FIR under Section 363 (kidnapping) of the IPC has been registered at the Indirapuram police station.
