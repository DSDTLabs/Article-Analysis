On Saturday, director   had announced his big budget film Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham on Kunjali   IV with   in the lead. The director had earlier told us that he would go ahead with the project only if Santosh Sivan’s directorial   with   didn’t start shooting in eight months.

 The announcement has apparently sent down ripples signifying that Mammootty’s film is in troubled waters. However, Santosh insists that the film “is not dropped but will take time to start shooting”. “Everyone associated with both projects are busy and it’s not like one fine day we can get them together and begin shooting to see whose film goes on floors first,” says the director.
 
 The filmmaker and the multiple time National award winning cinematographer though tells us that Priyadarshan had contacted him a week ago to talk about his Kunjali Marakkar project with Mohanlal. “A week ago, Priyan had called me to ask when we would start shooting. I told him, ‘I am busy with a few films and the movie will only go on floors after that’. Priyan said he would definitely like to make a movie on Kunjali Marakkar; both films will be from different perspectives and there will be enough to differentiate the films. He said his film have more of sea warfare and will be made on par with international films. That will require a lot of time and he wanted people to be fully committed to the project.”
 
 Santosh is currently busy shooting for Mani Ratnam’s movie Chekka Chivantha Vaanam, which has been delayed due to the Kollywood strike. Mammootty, meanwhile, will resume filming his period movie Maamaankam.
