 Senthil Kumar, a local resident who is working at an oil refinery in the gulf, has come over to his village to be part of the protest. He said extraction of hydrocarbon would make the ground water saline. Unless the ground water is treated, it cannot be used, he said. As the technology is not popular in India, people will suffer, he added.
 
 “The government is trying to pacify the locals in order to allow a few business men make profits,” said Tamil film director Shanmugam. While several countries are dropping such extraction projects, the government is going ahead with the project without respecting public sentiment, he said.
 
 Speaking at the event, film director Karu Palaniappan took a dig at the Centre, thanking the Union government for introducing the project which opened the eyes of the people to its ill-effects. “Continuous campaigning by state BJP leaders in favour of the project too has helped people know about the disadvantages of the project,” he said.
 
 Taking a dig at BJP leader H Raja, Palaniappan said that Raja had asked outsiders to move out of   but he must know that BJP and ONGC are outsiders who should not interfere in state matters.
 
 Expressing similar sentiments, music director G V Prakash Kumar too urged the Union government to call off the project.

Members from several organizations from across the city gathered at central to take out a rally. However they were prevented by police because they had not got prior approval.
