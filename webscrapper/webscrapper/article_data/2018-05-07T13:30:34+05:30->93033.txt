The first week of May was indeed a stress buster for Malayalam movie stars. The entire acting fraternity took a break from their work to come together for the rehearsal sessions of their mega show, which was held in May 6 in Thiruvananthapuram.

 While the show was a mega success, it was the rehearsals that was more fun, especially the actors. Stars such as  ,  ,  , Jayaram,  , Manoj K Jayan and Tovino Thomas all got together in Thiruvananthapuram to practise while having a blast at each otherâ€™s expense.
 
 Selfies were the norm, with the younger stars crowding to take one with the superstars around. The rehearsals also saw some interesting combinations such as Dulquer and Mohanlal coming together for a skit as well Mohanlal and Mammootty shake a leg.
 
 Here are a few candid shots from the rehearsals:
