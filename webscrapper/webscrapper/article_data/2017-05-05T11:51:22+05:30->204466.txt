JAIPUR: Giving a boost to medical tourism, city doctors provided treatment to 13 Iraqi children suffering from heart ailment called   (CHD).

 Seven have already been discharged while remaining kids are recuperating in the hospital.
 
 “The children were treated for CHDs. Patients have responded well to the treatment. Out of the total 13 children, seven have already been discharged while the rest are recovering and are under observation. Once discharged, all of them will be able to lead a completely normal and healthy life,” said Dr  , additional director & head of the department, paediatric cardiac surgery in   Escorts Hospital, Jaipur. 
 
 War-torn Iraqis have found relief in Jaipur as their children with CHDs were operated by surgeons. The children belonged to the age group of six months to three-and-half months.
 
 However, it is expected that 300 such children from Iraq, suffering from same kind of heart ailment, will be operated in the city.
 
 If a child is suffering from CHD, it means he is born with an abnormally structured heart. The abnormalities could be because of holes between chamber partitions or it may be because of leaky valves of heart. These abnormalities can be treated through surgeries.
