Tuticorin: Charging the Centre with making full efforts to weaken the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) by not allocating sufficient funds and by refusing to give the nod for its expansion programmes, president of All India BSNL Officers’ Association, S Sivakumar alleged that the government was instead extending its support to help private telecom players.

 Addressing reporters here on Wednesday after taking part in the state executive committee of the association, Sivakumar said that BSNL was not given due focus for modernisation and expansion, though it has been growing steadily and also extending its services to the rural population. He said that BSNL is losing to private players who are aggressively expanding.
 
 He substantiated his claim by pointing out the recent creation of a separate corporation for maintaining more than 66,000 transmission towers of BSNL across India. “It is a classic example to support their claim that the Centre is in favour of private telecom companies, especially the Reliance Group,” he said.
 
 Sivakumar alleged that the BJP government supported private telecom players to make the best out of the 4G services launch though BSNL was the forerunner in submitting the application and was waiting indefinitely for the approval from the government.
 
 He also alleged that private telecom service providers that have been allotted only 2G and 3G bandwidth are now cheating customers by claiming that they are offering 4G services. “Sadly the Union government, though aware of the malpractice, is backing those fraudulent players by not taking action against them,” he added.
 
 On the delay in wage disparity, he said BSNL agreed for a 15% hike, whereas the Union ministry of communications refused to give its consent for the same. Condemning this, BSNL employees and officials have decided to organise demonstrations in the district headquarters across the country and a candle light procession at the national capital on October 4.
