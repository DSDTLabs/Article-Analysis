JAIPUR: Before presenting the proposed   Regional and   2018 ( ) in the ongoing state assembly for approval, the state government has sought suggestions and objections from the public till February 22 on the draft.

 
 The Bill aims to unify development rules across all urban areas. “The proposed draft lets the government follow an existing master plan, or ‘direct to prepare a fresh master plan under the provision of this Act and on and from the date on which the fresh draft master plan is published, such master plan or master development plan shall ceased to be in operation’, states the draft of the Regional and   Bill,” an official said.
 
 
 Once the draft is implemented, the state government can revise the regional or master plan, according to the necessity, even after implementation. The government can also conduct fresh surveys and revise the plan after directing the concerned town planning or local body.
 
 
 Sources in the department said that this would expedite development work as it might save unnecessary legal complications for the state government and help to revise master plans.
 
 
 Due to existing urban planning provisions, several government proposals, including those for regularising unauthorized colonies and illegal developments, have been stalled for long.
 
 
 The state government had earlier planned to bring an ordinance. A draft of the proposed ordinance was sent to the attorney general (AG) of India  . However, the AG turned down the proposal and directed to table the draft in the state assembly. “For the ordinance, approval is required from the state cabinet and finance department. The ordinance then comes into force after receiving the nod of the governor. As for the Bill, I will be tabled in the state assembly. Public representatives will debate on the pros and cons of the Bill,” an official said.
