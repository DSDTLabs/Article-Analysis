SHIMLA:   will implement emission standards under Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) from April 1, nearly two years after the Centre issued a notification for making the eco norm for cars mandatory in the country. 

 This means that only newly manufactured four-wheeled vehicles compliant with BS-IV will be allowed to be registered in the state. Transport minister G S Bali described the introduction of BS-IV as a “milestone” for checking pollution emitted by vehicles in the state. “This will reduce the emission of carbon mono-oxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur,” he said. “There is sufficient stock of BS-IV-compliant petroleum fuels in the state.” 
 
 The move comes two years after the Union minstry of road transport and highways had issued a notification on August 19, 2015, for making BS-IV the mandatory emission standard in the country. Bali said teh notification had been issued after the amendment of Rule 115 in the Centre Motor Vehicle Rules Act, 1989. 
 
 He said that as per this notification, the four wheeled vehicles manufactured on or after the October 1, 2015, will comply with BS-IV emission norms, but this shall not be applicable to four-wheeled transport vehicle plying on interstate permit, national permit or all-India tourist permit.
