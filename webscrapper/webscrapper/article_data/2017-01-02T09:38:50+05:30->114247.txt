CHENNAI: With as many as four all-Indian pairs and   participating in doubles at the 2017 edition of the  , the local interest couldn't have been greater. While Paes, who is seeded third alongside Brazil's  , will continue to be the biggest attraction, the pair of   and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan will also be keenly watched considering the former's snub for the Davis Cup tie against New Zealand in February.

 Paes confirmed that he will go into the Australian Open with Sa as his partner and hopes to find a good understanding with him starting in Chennai. "I think Andre is my 116th or 117th partner. I am going to play with him here, then in Auckland and the Australian Open. Hopefully, we will have a few good results and have a good partnership going. We can hope fully play well for the next few months, if not the whole year. Any new partnership takes some time to build," Paes said.
 
 There are also the unheralded pairs of Vishnu Vardhan-Sriram Balaji and Purav Raja Divij Sharan, both of whom will be hoping to create an upset or two.
 
 While Vishnu and Balaji have a relatively favourable tie against Sweden's Johan Brunstrom and Andreas Siljestrom, Purav and Divij have their task cut out against the formidable Paes and Sa.
 
 After his exclusion from the Davis Cup tie against New Zealand, the Chennai Open provides a perfect opportunity for the 36-year-old Bopanna to hit back at his critics.
