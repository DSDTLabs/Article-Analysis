PILIBHIT: The capture of a tigress that is said to have killed three persons in a week in a 4-km radius of   area has again brought to the forefront the problem of man-animal conflict in poll-bound Berkhera constituency. The matter has now become an election issue with BSP candidate from Berkhera assembly area,  , blaming the six killings in Pilibhit since November 28 on the SP-led government’s apathy in setting up safety measures for the villagers. Gangwar also said, “The state government took credit for notifying PTR but completely failed to fulfill the requirement of a tiger reserve.”
 
  The BSP leader has also raised the issue of reparation for damage to crops caused during combing operation by forest teams atop elephants. He has demanded a survey of damage and prompt action in the matter.
  
  Villagers in the area said the capture can at best bring temporary reprieve for them so long as no steps are taken to deal with the menace permanently. Nor have they been given any compensation for crop damage caused during the combing operations by the forest department teams.
  
  As Babu Ram, a farmer of  , put it, “My 1.2 acres of sugarcane crop was completely ruined during the tranquilizing operation by the forest department.” The man-eater was hiding in his field. Another resident of the same village, Kalicharan, said, “Elephants trod on my mustard and wheat crops during the combing operations.”
  
    Pandey and Shatrughan of Chandupur village, Ram Charan of Manpur village were among those who suffered heavy damages to their standing rabi crops during the combing by the elephants.
  
  When asked about this, ADM (finance and revenue) AK Saini said there was no provision under revenue laws to compensate farmers for this kind of damage. He added that he would seek guidelines from state authorities on this issue.
