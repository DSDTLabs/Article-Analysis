THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Seeking support of non-resident Keralites for the successful functioning of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board ( ), finance minister T M   said the government has targeted mobilization of Rs 20,000 crore through the   in two years. 

 "We expect at least 10 lakh NRKs to join the Pravasi Chitty, which is a great opportunity for them to enjoy an interest rate much higher than that being offered by banks and to be a part of Kerala's developmental activities," the minister said during a sector-based discussion on 'Finance' held as part of the Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) meet here on Saturday.
 
 The KIIFB CEO K M Abraham, who also took part in the discussions, said Pravasi Chitty, which is being linked to pension and insurance schemes, was a good investment opportunity for the NRKs. "The applications and procedures for the Chitty are done online and they are simple and transparent," he said on a query from the   representatives.
 
 Former finance minister K M Mani said investment from NRKs was vital to save the government from huge liability it could incur for spending on developmental activities. Dr   said more profitable projects should be initiated under KIIFB, while Gulfar Mohammed Ali said the NRKs were ready to invest in good projects. Among other recommendations from NRKs that came up during the discussions were launch of investment products like a state sovereign fund, formation of a consortium for loss-making PSUs, chitty for NRKs in other Indian states and upgradation of KSFE into a bank.
