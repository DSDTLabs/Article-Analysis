NEW DELHI: Fireworks are expected during the three-day   session of Delhi assembly starting Monday. Sources said   MLAs were likely to raise the issue of   across the city. The opposition BJP, on the other hand, may try to corner the AAP government for not clearing a proposal to notify 351 city roads for commercial and mixed land use.

 The city government maintains that traders are being harassed by the civic bodies. Scores of commercial establishments have been sealed in the past few weeks over non-payment of conversion charges and other reasons, such as unauthorised construction and violation of norms. 
 
 The sealing drive is likely to intensify from Tuesday — the deadline to pay conversion charges ends on Monday.
 
 Saurabh Bhardwaj, AAP MLA from Greater Kailash, alleged that the corporations were using the threat of sealing to extort money from traders. He said: “Traders at GK-I and GK-II markets are living in a state of terror ever since the sealing exercise began,” he said.
 
 While AAP MLAs plan to raise the issue inside the assembly, the party intends to hold protests outside the corporations’ headquarters. The BJP, too, is likely to up the ante. Vijender Gupta, the leader of opposition, has requested the speaker to allow discussion on sealing.
 
 “The government didn’t notify 351 roads for commercial and mixed land use so that thousands of traders could be protected from sealing. The civic bodies had sent the proposal to the Delhi government in 2007. In the last three years, the AAP government didn’t bother about the traders,” Gupta said.
 
 Filling up of EWS quota in private schools, FDI in single-brand retail, the SC order to set up a new SIT to re-examine the 1984 anti-Sikh riot cases and the Max Hospital baby death are also likely to figure during the session.
 
 No bill is expected to be tabled. “The   should have been longer so that various issues relevant to the city could be taken up,” Gupta said.
