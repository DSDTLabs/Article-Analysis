BHUBANESWAR: A three-member   central team, led by the party's national general secretary Saroj Pandey, reached here on Saturday for a fact-finding exercise on the alleged rape and subsequent suicide of a Class IX girl in the Kunduli area of Koraput district. 

 The girl was allegedly raped on October 10 last year and she committed suicide on January 22.
 
 Pandey said the team would visit Kunduli on Saturday, interact with the girl's family and locals. "We will discuss the issue with police and the district administration," she said. The other members of the team are MPs Jyodi Dhruve and Anju Bala.
 
 Pandey said the girl was forced to commit suicide as despite her frequent appeals to the police and the government, she did not get justice. Terming the 'silence' of the State Women's Commission and chief minister   on the issue as unfortunate, she reiterated BJP's demand for a CBI inquiry into the alleged rape and suicide.
 
 A BJP statement said the team would return to Delhi on Monday and submit a report on its findings to party president  .
 
 BJD spokesperson Amar Prasad Satpathy accused the saffron party of politicising the issue. "The crime branch and a judicial commission are probing the unfortunate incident. The truth will come out," Satpathy said.
 
 Speaking at a public meeting at Mahanga in Cuttack district on Friday, Union minister   said the Kunduli incident would sink the Naveen government in the same way the Anjana Mishra rape case had sunk the JB Patnaik-led Congress government in the state. 
 
 In January 1999, Anjana, the estranged wife of an Indian   officer, was allegedly raped on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar.
