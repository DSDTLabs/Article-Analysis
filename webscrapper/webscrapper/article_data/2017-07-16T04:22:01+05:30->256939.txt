MUMBAI: The   outbreak in the city and its extended suburbs continued with a BJP corporator’s wife and niece diagnosed with the   even as a truck driver from Rabale succumbed to the influenza in a Navi Mumbai hospital (see box) last week.

 Kandivli corporator  , whose wife, Shanti, has H1N1, said BMC is not doing enough to tackle the rise of H1N1 cases. Shanti is admitted in Borivli’s Trinity hospital and was scheduled to be discharged late Saturday.
 
 Yadav said, “First, my brother’s teenage daughter was detected with H1N1 and then my wife. While my wife was detected with swine flu, I found the medicines were insufficient.’’
 
 He also alleged that civic-run Dr   in Kandivli has inadequate facilities. He said, “The blood reports are being given almost 48 hours later. How can one wait that long as there are chances of the patient’s condition getting worse?’’ Yadav further said that as ward committee chairman, he raised the issue with the authorities. “But there isn’t any improvement in the situation.”
 
 However, a senior BMC health official said H1N1 spreads through air droplets. “We have been telling people to cover their mouth while coughing, but many don’t,’’ the official said. The BMC has also been carrying out “contact tracing” for every patient: tests are carried out and medicines provided to relatives and friends with symptoms.
 
 While H1N1 infection usually ebbs in rainy season, this year has been different. Mumbai, which registered less than 10 cases last year, listed 484 cases between January 1 and July 1 as well as 16 deaths.
 
 The official said adequate stocks of oseltamivir, the anti-viral medication, and vaccines are available. “The syrup isn’t available, but tablets are.”
