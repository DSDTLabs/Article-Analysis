MUMBAI: Indian flyers are in for a bonanza. After about a 15% rise in average   in the last couple of months, airlines are back with massive discounts for the lean travel months of June to August. 

 Earlier in the day,   took the lead by offering fares as low as Rs 899. The fares are mostly for shorter sectors. For instance, an Agartala-Kolkata flight ticket can be bought for an all inclusive fare of Rs 1,599. The ticket for an Ahmedabad-Mumbai flight is available for Rs 1,299 and a Bagdogra-Guwahati flight is for Rs 899, the lowest available flash fare. 
 
 Rival   soon followed with fares such as Rs 1,189 for Delhi-Jaipur and Rs 1,642 on Mumbai-Ahmedabad. Go Air introduced fares such as Rs 1,699 for Ahmedabad-Pune and Rs 1,950 for Delhi-Jammu. 
 
 “The discounts have come after at least a couple of months and we have already seen an increase in our bookings,” said Sharat Dhall, president of Yatra.com. “The summer holiday season is coming to an end and airlines are making a smart move to bolster demand, especially in the months of July and August,” he added. 
 
 Airlines had, hurt by price wars, dented margins and an inch-up in fuel prices, begun to hike prices in the beginning of this calendar year. 
 
 “In the last few months airlines have been trying to increase their yields primarily through increase in close-in pricing. But the resultant hike in fares had an impact on seat occupancy. Which is why you saw just about an 18.6% rise in traffic during March compared to last year. While other months have seen growth in 20s. The sales will drive higher growth for the domestic sector" said Balu Ramachandran, head of air and   at Cleartrip.
