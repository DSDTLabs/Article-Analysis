MUMBAI: With easterly winds continuing and sea breeze setting in late, the city on Saturday recorded a maximum temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius, which is generally experienced in April and May. 

 It’s the second   in the last one decade, as per the records of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) (see box). On Friday, Mumbai had recorded a maximum temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius. 
 
  Saturday’s maximum temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius equals the maximum temperature recorded in February 2015. Last year, it was 33.2 degrees Celsius, recorded on February 23.

Mumbai said it was the continuing easterly winds which was the reason for this spike in maximum temperatures. “The sea breeze is also setting in late during the past few days leading to this rise in temperatures. The situation is likely to be the same for the next 2-3 days,” Rajeev said. 
 
 The all-time record for the hottest February day is 39.6 degrees Celsius recorded on February 25, 1996. 
 
 Mumbaikars said that afternoons especially are unbearable. “Despite such high temperatures breaking records year after year, we are looking at cutting trees in the city. There is a need for us to thicken our green cover further,” said Nikhil Desai, a resident of King’ Circle.
