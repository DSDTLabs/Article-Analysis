CHANDIGARH: Captain   on Thursday became the 26th chief minister of Punjab with former Prime Minister   and   vice-president   attending his swearing-in ceremony in Chandigarh.

 At the packed   lawns, Amarinder inducted nine ministers in his council, which was a delicate balancing act between castes, regions, age groups and gender. 
 
 This is among the smallest council of ministers to take oath in the past three decades. In the previous two Akali governments, 18 and 16 ministers were sworn in.
 
 As expected, Amarinder did not go for a deputy CM despite the buzz that cricketer-turned-politician   will be given the post. The former   MP was allocated local government, tourism, culture affairs, archives and museum departments. 
 
 He was the third minister to take oath after Amarinder and veteran leader Brahm Mohindra. Sidhu was seen touching Amarinderâ€™s feet after taking oath.
