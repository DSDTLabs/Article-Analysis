AHMEDABAD: While Gujarat may be among the biggest consumers of gold among the states of India, buyers of the precious metal here are reluctant to invest in gold monetization schemes (GMS). 

  A study carried out by IIM, Ahmedabad found that residents of Gujarat are less inclined towards investing in   or other gold monetization schemes. The public stock of gold in India is close to 25,000 tonnes, according to estimates provided in the study. Of this, only six or seven tonnes of the yellow metal was invested in a gold monetization scheme.

Moreover, gold is also passed on from one generation to the next, adding to the consumer’s emotional attachment to the commodity. Therefore, they are more reluctant to hold gold assets in paper form.”
 
 Gujarat ranks fifth in a state-wise analysis of the propensity to consider gold as an investment rather than a sentimental object, conducted as part of the same study, titled, ‘Gold Monetization in India as a Transformative Policy’. Reluctance to invest in gold is higher in the rural populace. “Rural buyers are more reluctant to part with gold as compared to urban consumers, but they are also ready to pledge gold as collateral, with 74% of rural consumers being open to pledging gold, suggesting “liquidity use” of gold on the basis of requirement,” Sahay added.
 
 The study concluded that there is a need for improvisation for better implementation of the   that was introduced in 2015.
