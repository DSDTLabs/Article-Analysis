CALANGUTE: The Goa State Pollution Control Board ( ) on Tuesday conducted an inspection at   to verify complaints that a number of hotels and resorts in the area were releasing sewage into the   creek.

 GSPCB officials conducted water sampling and analysis of the entire Baga creek and also inspected nullahs and outlets connecting to the creek from Arpora as well as from the   side.
 
 The team comprised Calangute village panchayat member and member of the GSPCB, Shawn Martins, Arpora sarpanch  , member of the Candolim health centre management committee,  , village development committee (VDC) member Anna D’Mello and other officials from the pollution control board.
 
  The team inspected the entire stretch beginning from the Tambudki bridge and flowing by the Sankwadi area towards the Baga bridge and the Baga creek connecting Calangute beach. They found a number of pipes discharging sewage into the Baga creek during the inspection, following which the pipes were sealed.
 
 The GSPCB officials said they would have to verify the source of the pipes before initiating any action. Local activists have been complaining that most of the resorts in Baga have been releasing their untreated sewage into the Baga creek, leading to unsanitary conditions, while local fishermen have been complaining that the fish which used to be found aplenty in the once-pristine Baga creek, have now almost disappeared due to the pollution of water.
 
 “We want to save the Baga creek and after doing the analysis, GSPCB will take necessary action,” Martins told reporters. 
 
 “We have noticed that there is sewage water flowing through the connecting nullahs so we are analysing this water by collecting samples in order to make the people aware that this is their creek which is polluted,” he added.
