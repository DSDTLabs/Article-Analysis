NEW DELHI: A day after   ( ) filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) seeking reply from the Haryana government over high   in the Yamuna,   has directed   to collect and analyse samples from four major locations to tests for   concentration. 

 The plea, filed on Monday, had stated that the river had high ammonia levels polluting the drinking water source.
 
 A bench comprising Justice Jawad Rahim and SP Wangdi ordered Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to collect samples to detect the levels of ammonia and other pollutants at four locations — Pajewala in Haryana, Wazirabad water treatment plant, Okhla and ITO barrage. NGT further asked CPCB to submit the findings in the next date of hearing on February 16.
 
 On Monday, NGT had served a notice to the Haryana government seeking a reply on the high ammonia levels.
 
 “The present application, filed by DJB, seeks direction to the Haryana government to urgently take steps and check dangerous ammonia levels and other consequent pollution in the drinking water source of the Yamuna,” said the petition, citing that it has been the cause of polluted water in Wazirabad reservoir.
 
 DJB had also contended that the sewage treatment plants were being unable to treat water properly, due to which the pollution levels were extremely high.
 
 “Constantly monitor ammonia levels before the water enters into the Wazirabad pond in Delhi from Haryana. Take immediate steps to clean the water and reduce the foul smell,” the plea said, adding immediate steps were needed to keep ammonia levels below 0.3 PPM and under no circumstances above 0.5 PPM.
 
 A DJB estimate states that nearly 35% of the water supply in Delhi was affected due to high ammonia levels and pollution.
