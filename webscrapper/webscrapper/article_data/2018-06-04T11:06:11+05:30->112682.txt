This was announced by Union cultural and environment minister Mahesh Sharma here on Sunday during a workshop of stakeholders on issues related to pollution around the 17th century monument.
  
  He said, “We are forming an 11-member committee for Taj Mahal, which will have industrialists, social workers and journalists on board.” According to the minister, the opinion of the committee will help the administration to look at various issues in depth. “Whatever suggestions are being given at this workshop will be recorded and documented, so that no one passes the buck,” Sharma said.

The apex court also expressed concern over Taj Mahal being infected by insects and asked the authorities, including the ASI, what steps they have taken to prevent this.
