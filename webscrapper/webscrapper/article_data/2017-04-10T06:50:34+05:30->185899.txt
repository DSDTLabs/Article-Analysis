MUMBAI: As this academic year draws to an end, schools in the city are confused about the state's directive to conduct a re-exam for the students who fail in class IX. 

 While the state issued a government resolution about the same earlier this year, some schools are unsure if the directive will be implemented this time while some others are planning to conduct the re-exam as per their convenience.
 
 According to a government resolution issued by the school education department in January, all schools in the state will have to give students, who fail class IX, a second chance by holding a re-exam in July.
 
  The decision was made as part of the state's Key Result Area objectives declared in September 2016. The state said that over 1.5 lakh students had failed in class IX in April 2016 which could lead them to drop out of the system.
 
 Some schools are unsure if they have to conduct the re-exam in July. "We have been following up with the education department to get clarity on the issue but there are no clear instructions. We do not know whether we should plan the next academic year keeping in mind the re-exams in July. We also want the government to advice us on how to accommodate the students who pass the re-exam," said trustee of a school.
 
 Some other schools are planning to hold the re-examination at the end of April instead of July. 
 
 Suvarna Kharat, deputy secretary of the school education department was unavailable for comment.
