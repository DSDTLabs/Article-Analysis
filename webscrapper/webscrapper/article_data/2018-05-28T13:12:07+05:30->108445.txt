 Squealing in the arms of her mother, baby Himanshi excitedly points at Gabru, the family dog. She never got to see her father, Ghanshyam Dhakad, who died on June 8 after being picked up by police during the farmers’ protest last year.
 
 
 Ghanshyam’s wife, Rekha, is still seething with anger. It was Rekha who left chief minister   searching for words when he met her to offer condolences. “What will I do with Rs 1 crore that you will give me? I will give you Rs 2 crore — can you get my husband back?” she had asked Chouhan.
 
 Rekha repeats the same to TOI. “We have received the money. But no one can fill the shoes of a father,” she says. Ghanshyam had gone to pick up an LPG cylinder from Dalauda when he was picked up by police, says his family. He left the house just hours before Himanshi was born in Rekha’s maternal home.
 
 Unlike five others who were shot by police, Ghanshyam died after being beaten by police, alleges his family. “Police covered it up. The guilty were merely transferred. Where is justice in this?” Rekha asks.
 
 Those who killed the five other farmers could face action once the probe commission submits its report. “But, what of my husband,” asks Rekha. “It’s a clear case of custodial death, but no FIR has been filed. How will we get justice?”
 
 Rekha has put the Rs 1 crore in a fixed deposit account as “safety cover” for her children. She got a job as a 4th class employee at Sitamau tehsil office. “I do the work of a clerk. My focus is now on getting my children educated well.”
 
 Her son Rudra is in class 2 of an English-medium school. “I want CM to fulfil his promise of paying for my children’s education,” she says as Rudra prods the dog to bark. The dog is important for the family because their house is in an isolated location. Ghanshyam’s father Durgalal Dhakad says the CM had even promised a plot near a populated area and help in constructing the house.
