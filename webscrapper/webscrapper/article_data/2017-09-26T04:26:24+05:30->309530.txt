NEW DELHI: Former railway minister   Prasad Yadav failed to appear before   on Monday again and sought two more weeks’ time from the central agency. The anti-corruption probe agency wants to interrogate the   (RJD) chief in connection with alleged corruption in connection with maintenance contract for two IRCTC hotels to a private firm when he was the Union minister. Yadav, sources said, sent his lawyer to the agency who submitted the request seeking two weeks’ time for questioning.

 However, it was not clear whether Lalu’s son   will also skip his summon for Tuesday. CBI had first summoned father and son on September 11 and 12. Lalu Yadav did not turn up at that time citing an ongoing court case in Ranchi where his presence was required, while Tejashwi claimed he had political commitments to take care of.
 
 CBI has alleged that Lalu Yadav, as railway minister, handed over the maintenance of two hotels run by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation— a subsidiary of the Indian Railways—in Ranchi and Puri to Sujata Hotels, a company owned by Vinay and Vijay Kochhar, in return for a prime plot of three acres in   procured through a benami company.
 
 The FIR alleged that he abused his official position for extending undue favours to the Kochhars.
