 A division bench headed by Justice Jayant M Patel adjourned the hearing on a contempt petition filed by her to July 20 to await the government's response.
 
 During the hearing, the government advocate sought three months' time to effectively implement the cabinet's decision to appoint her on compassionate grounds. He told the court that the relevant rules needed to be framed by the department of personnel and administrative reforms as this was a special case and the first of its kind.

 In the order, the state was told to treat her case as a special one and provide her a job on compassionate grounds within three months (either in the government or in an undertaking controlled by the state). The Union government was asked to consider and decide within four months on her representation and pay an appropriate sum of money to her.

The state government had paid her Rs 3 lakh on a direction from the court and another Rs 9.5 lakh towards her medical expenses. The central government had informed the court that as per the scheme for assistance to civilian victims of terrorist violence, a maximum compensation of Rs 3 lakh was permissible.
