MUMBAI: Five former   who met at the wedding reception of another ex-co-worker were killed when the car they were travelling in crashed into a tree on the Mahim-Palghar Road in the early hours of Wednesday.

 The accident, which occurred on the pitch dark, desolate stretch around 3am, was discovered three hours later.
 
 
  
  
 
 The victims were returning home after attending the wedding in Vadrai, a fishing village in Satpati. The celebrations had continued late into the night. 
 
 Viraj Vetal (25), a   resident who was helping his father in his transport business, offered to drop his former colleagues Nilesh Tamore (25), Kiran Pagdhare (30), Dipesh Pagdhare (24) and Santosh Bahiram (27) to their respective homes in Tarapur, Vadrai, Satpati and Palghar, respectively. 
 
 They had all worked together in a pharmaceutical company earlier. While Viraj later joined his father’s business, others took up other jobs.
 
 Satpati police suspect that the car was speeding at over 140kmph. Viraj is believed to have lost control of it and banged into a huge   tree at Patil Pada in Mahim village, around 7km from Vadrai. The car was found dangling on the edge of a dry nullah next to the tree.
 
 Such was the impact of the crash that even the air bags could not save the car’s occupants.
 
 The accident came to light around 6am when constable Prakash Raut of Satpati police was on his way to work. Raut said he called for an ambulance and the bodies were taken to a rural hospital. Danish Khan, a pot seller in the vicinity, said he had heard the sound but could not see anything as it was dark.
 
 A case has been registered against Viraj under IPC sections 304A for causing death by negligence, 279 for rash driving, 337 for causing hurt and 338 for grievous hurt, and Section 184 of the Motor Vehicle Act. While cops did not confirm if Viraj was drunk, they said the possibility of him dozing off behind the wheels cannot be ruled out.
