LUCKNOW:The   government has banned the sale of tobacco near universities and colleges in the state. UP’s higher education department has issued an order asking all universities, colleges to make their campus tobaccofree.

 The order asks officials to ensure that there are shops selling tobacco products within prohibited zone of 100 yards around higher educational institutions and submit quarterly reports on sections 4 and 6
 
 (b) of the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act ( ), 2003 to director, higher education, for follow ups.
 
 Higher education director   has directed officials — registrars, regional higher educational officers and principals — to enforce a ban on the use of pan and tobacco in universities and colleges. Officials have been asked to put up sign boards against tobacco use in campus. No student, teacher, or any employee should be seen consuming tobacco products inside the premises. Educational institutions should also organise various activities to spread awareness on the ill-effects of tobacco, the letter states.
 
 
 
 
 The ban will also be a value addition to the ‘Swachhata’ campaign of Central and state governments. A clean and green environment will ensure better teaching-learning on the campus, said an official, adding that a nodal officer would be appointed to help colleges enforce the order. Sale of tobacco products near educational institutions will be violation of COTPA, said officials.
 
 Union ministry of health and family welfare had earlier written to chief secretaries of all states regarding developing a mechanism to combat tobacco menace. It said permission/authorisation to retail shops should be granted in a manner that if they sell tobacco products, they should not be allowed to sell non-tobacco products.
