INDORE: Pakistan-returned deaf and speech impaired girl, 
  is all set to meet prospective grooms, but under the watch of district officials.

 
 After receiving an overwhelming response to a ‘matrimonial ad’, posted on   seeking for a ‘smart, deaf-mute boy’ for Geeta, the ministry of external affairs has shortlisted some candidates and directed the Indore district administration to organize her meeting with the prospective grooms.
 
 “We received around 60 proposals. They are mostly from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. They had been sent to the ministry, where the officials concerned shortlisted some candidates, and asked the district collector, Nishant Warwade to organize their meeting with Geeta,” Indore-based sign language expert Gyanendra   said.
 
 Purohit, who worked as interpreter for Geeta during her initial days back in India, had posted the ‘matrimonial ad’ after he claimed to have received consent from the ministry.
 
 
 
 
 Purohit said, “Geeta’s priorities include a smart and good looking deaf-mute boy, who has good command over sign-language. Her preference is for an established person, whose religion should be Hindu.”
 
 He added, the external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj has said Geeta is India’s daughter and her marriage will be organized by the government. “We have received about 22-25 shortlisted bio data from the ministry. The same will be shown to Geeta and whom she will select, will be given a call and opportunity to meet her,” zila panchayat CEO, Neha Meena told TOI.
 
 The date and place to hold a meeting of Geeta and the shortlisted candidates are yet to be finalized, she said. “With the help of zila panchayat, the social justice department and the NGOs helping in the matter, we are preparing a timetable to organize a meeting of the shortlisted candidates and Geeta. Every step will be taken with the prospective bride’s consent” Warwade said.
