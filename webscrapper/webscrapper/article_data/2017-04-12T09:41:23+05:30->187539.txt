 Chikkodi municipality’s 40-year-old chairperson,  , is back in school for some unfinished work. With help from her youngest daughter Niveditha, who is writing her   this year, Munde is preparing for her own   scheduled for April 12.
 
 “I failed in English and Mathematics in 1993 during my SSLC exams. A lot was going on; I was preparing to get married (which took place in 1994), and couldn’t focus on studies. But I feel I’m ready now to complete my education,” says Munde.
 
 Munde studied at the Government high school in Yellihulloli of Hukkeri taluk.
 
 Her wish to finish her secondary education has been such that the decades of gap between the last time she sat for these exams doesn’t count anymore. She’s re-taking all subjects.
 
 Munde, who has three daughters, says despite being a young mother, she was active in community work. Over the years, she became the municipality chairperson. “Now that my children are older and I don’t have many responsibilities, I want to compete my studies,” she says.
