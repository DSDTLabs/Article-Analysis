PUNE: The cyber crime cell of the Pune police on Sunday arrested   (34) for allegedly installing skimmer (machine) at isolated ATMs in Pune for stealing   data. 

 Mbaeze from Sangvi is the third suspect arrested in card-cloning case. Police had earlier arrested his accomplices, Ogbehase Fortune (42) from Pimple Gurav and Bashar Dakingari Usman (26) from Pirangut, on July 11 and 12.
 
 Mbaeze had come to India on a business visa in 2015. Before coming to Pune, he was staying in Mumbai. The cell inspector Manisha Zende said, “The involvement of Mbaeze had come to light during the interrogation of his two accomplices. We have recovered three cellphones and Rs 8,000 from him.” 
 
 She said, “We suspect Mbaeze for using skimmer for copying data of debit cards from ATMs. Mbaeze claimed that he was a garments dealer, but failed to furnish evidence.” We have invoked charges of conspiracy under section 120 (b) of the IPC on the three suspects, she added.
