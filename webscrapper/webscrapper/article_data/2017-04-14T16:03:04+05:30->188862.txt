BAREILLY: The family of Yashpal, a young man who served time in a Pakistan jail after straying into that country, only to return home with mental health problems in 2013, has spoken up for release of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the   officer who was awarded the death sentence by a Pakistan military court for espionage. 

  Yashpal, 27, a native of   village under   tehsil of  , was working as a rickshaw-puller in Delhi. He reportedly took the wrong train and ended up in Pakistan in 2010, where he was arrested and lodged in prison. Even after completing his prison term, Yashpal languished in jail due to delay by UP government in confirming his citizenship status. He was sent to India in July 2013. However, on his return, it came to light that he had become mentally ill. "My son is suffering from mental illness after he was tortured in Pakistan. Six other Indian prisoners were released along with Yashpal on the same day. Four of them too were suffering from mental illness. The government should actively work on securing Jadhav's release. They should take all steps required to save Jadhav's life," said Babu Ram, father of Yashpal. 
 
  "The case of Jadhav has again highlighted the issue that the government needs to reform their policy for helping prisoners lodged in Pakistan's jails. If any representative of the Indian government stays in touch with Indian citizens languishing in jails there, Pakistan will not be able to torture Indian prisoners," said Babu Ram who works as an agricultural labourer. He added that they are still awaiting district administration to fulfil their promises of giving free land and loan to purchase livestock for helping Yashpal to begin a new life. Things have not changed even in three years as Yashpal never speaks to anybody and sits in silence outside his house.
