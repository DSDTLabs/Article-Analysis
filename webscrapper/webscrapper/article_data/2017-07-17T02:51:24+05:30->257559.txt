GURUGRAM: Residents of   1, DLF -3 and 4 faced six-hour-long power cut on Sunday, leaving them agitated. While residents of   witnessed power cut from 3am to 9am,   and 4 saw frequent outages from 6am to 11am.

 Locals complained that two-three hour   have become a routine in the area and they have to depend on diesel generators in the absence of power supply. 
 
 “Power cut on Sunday morning has ruined an off day. Though, we are quite used to it now. We try to wrap up all the important work at night as power cuts have become a regular phenomenon during morning hours,” said Kashmira Singh, a resident of Sushant Lok 1.
 
 Residents of DLF-3 said the power supply always becomes erratic after rainfall. “Even a slight rainfall leads to long power cuts. As the city witnessed light showers last evening, the power supply became erratic since then. Today morning, we witnessed at least two-hour-long power cuts for two to three times,” said Harish Yadav, another resident of DLF -3. 
 
 Residents blamed poor power distribution infrastructure in their areas for erratic power supply. “It is ridiculous to promise 24-hour electricity in Gurgaon, as the entire power infrastructure needs to be changed,” said Rajat, a resident from Sushant Lok 1.
