KOLKATA: Biswajit Ghorui-—who earned the sobriquet, “Mangsho Bishu”, for his capability of   or fish at a short notice—worked with an   and sold around 13,000kg carcass meat a month that he sourced from   in and around the city to his Rajabazar cold storage, where it was treated with chemicals. Ghorui’s monthly transaction was of an astronomical amount: he bought carcass meat for around Rs 8 lakh—Rs 60 a kg—and sold it for around Rs 24 lakh a month.

 
 “Ghorui has bought four properties in the Garia area in the past three years,” said a police officer, adding neighbours thought he was into meat export business. The officer added every morning, when Ghorui left for work, he would travel only in app cabs. Also dabbling in realty, he had recently fitted ACs in almost all his bedrooms, neighbours told the police.
 
 Ghorui’s questioning has led the police to two more linkmen. “We have arrested Sk Sikander Ali from Madhyagram. He used his threewheeler to transport carcass meat from Sharafat to Ghorui and then ferried ‘treated meats’ to distributors in North 24 Parganas,” said an officer. Ghorui also took the help of another transporter, Mohd Iqlak, whose exact role is being investigated. “Ghorui has claimed he sent the processed carcass meat to at least three of his contacts in Kolkata, who in turn, sent the consignments to other states as well as outside the country. A manhunt has been launched,” the officer added.
 
 The Special Investigation Team are identifying the men who took the consignments-—carcass meat blended with edible meat—to markets. “They doubled as field agents and took specific orders. Ghorui has named a number of distributors in the adjoining districts,” an officer said.
 
 SP (South 24 Parganas) Koteswar Rao said as the gang was well organized, it would take time to unravel the entire modus operandi. “Given the extent of the racket, we are ascertaining if the meats were stored in places other than the Rajabazar cold storage,” he said.
