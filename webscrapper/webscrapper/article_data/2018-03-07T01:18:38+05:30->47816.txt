NEW DELHI: Delhi’s   ( )   is the best airport in the world in terms of  , according to the latest Airport Service Quality (ASQ) 2017   released by  .

  
  
 
 In 2016, South Korea’s Incheon International Airport was on top of the list. 
 
 At present, ASQ is the only worldwide programme to survey passengers at airports. The programme measures passengers’ views on 34 key performance indicators and 74% of the world’s top 100 busiest airports are part of its network. The 34 parameters include airport access, security screening, check-in facilities, restrooms, stores, restaurants, etc.
 
 The IGI airport has been ranked number one in the world in the highest category—airports with over 40 million passengers per annum. The airport surpassed the likes of Singapore’s Changi, Incheon and Bangkok airports in terms of passenger growth. The Delhi airport took the number two spot in the same category in 2016, while it was the number one airport in the world in 2015 in the smaller category of 25-40 million passengers per annum. In 2017, it saw a total of 63.5 million passengers. 
 
 Officials said this makes the Delhi airport the seventh busiest airport in Asia and puts it among the top 20 busiest airports across the world in terms of passenger traffic. “It is profoundly gratifying to win this year’s ACI-ASQ award for the world no. 1 rank in the highest category of over 40 million passenger per year. The award demonstrates DIAL’s strong focus on operational efficiencies and resilient approach towards service delivery,” said I Prabhakara Rao, CEO, Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL).
 
 Rao added that the initial phase between 2006 and 2010 was the toughest. The GMR-led consortium took over operations in 2006 when the airport was ranked 101. However, a lot of work was put in and its rank improved. “We have developed rapidly and have been able to handle the growth of passengers...while still providing quality service...the quality will not go down,” Rao said.
