NASHIK: A 24-year-old pregnant woman was set on fire, allegedly by her husband and in-laws in Satana taluka of Nashik district on Saturday night after she refused to abort her pregnancy. The victim has 55% burn injuries and has been admitted to the Nashik civil hospital. 

 The woman's husband, brother-in-law and father-in-law are absconding.
 
 According to the Satana police, Rupali Vilas Kumavat, 24, a resident of Ambika Nagar, Satana, was at home when an argument broke out between her and her husband Vilas, brother-in-law   and father-in-law   over her  . The police said that Rupali was Vilas' second wife and lived separately from Vilas who would visit her from time to time. Since Rupali already had three children, her husband and in-laws did not want her to have a fourth child.
 
  As the argument heated up, her husband beat her with a wooden stick, while her brother-in-law doused her with petrol. Later, Vilas lit a matchstick and threw it on Rupali. The suspects fled the scene after setting Rupali on fire. API G B Buva of the Satana police station, who is investigating the case said, "When Rupali started shouting, residents of the nearby area ran in, extinguished the fire and rushed her to Nashik civil hospital." 
 
  Buva said that Vilas works in the construction firm. A few years ago, Rupali had lodged a rape complaint against Vilas and as part of the settlement he had married her and kept her separate from his family.
