New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday pulled up the Delhi government, various civic bodies, including DDA and the municipal corporations, for converting playgrounds in residential areas into “ornamental parks” and multi-level parking.

 It demanded to know if all such   are utilised for other purposes, “where will children go to play?”
 
 The poser by a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar came during hearing of a petition filed by a Defence Colony resident who alleged that several parks in the area were being converted into ornamental parks or parking lots, robbing children of valuable space to play.
 
 Taking note of the plea,   asked why the authorities are converting parks into parking lots. “That is what Delhi is fit for now, parks becoming parking lots. Where will the children go to play?” the bench remarked, while directing the authorities, including the Delhi government and the DDA, to file affidavits about the status of available parks in the city and to also indicate whether there was sufficient green area and lung space for citizens.
 
 It also issued notice to the Centre, the Delhi government, DDA the national and state commissions for protection of child rights and SDMC seeking their replies.
 
 The bench listed the matter for hearing on September 5.
