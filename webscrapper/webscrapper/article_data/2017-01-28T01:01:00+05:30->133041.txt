New Delhi: The 26-year-old   who was seen throwing her two-and-a-half-year-old child off the   in a video at their   house was detained on Friday.

 The woman, Sonu’s family said she was short tempered and had earlier attacked her husband as well. The child, Ashu, is being counselled by Child Welfare Committee who would also decide on his future custody.
 
 In his statement, Sonu’s husband, Nitin Gupta, told the police that she had tried to attack the child earlier too. A relative told the cops that she had once burnt Ashu’s clothes and also throttled him, but was stopped by her father-in-law, Ravinder. 
 
 Sonu married Nitin five years ago and had started suffering from severe stress after her delivery. She was also undergoing treatment, her family told the police. Police have requested counsellors to talk to Sonu and find out if she was suffering from an ailment. 
 
 Sonu told the police that she had an argument with her in-laws over inviting some relatives home after which she attacked Ashu in a fit of rage.
 
 Ravinder said he has been trying to counsel Sonu, but she used to get aggressive and to vent her anger she used to hurt Ashu. “She even had scuffles with other family members over petty issues and accused them of invading her private space. We then planned to get her treated,” said Vishal, Nitin’s relative. 
 
 Police said Ashu was handed over to his maternal uncle. Counsellors have also spoken to Sonu’s parents to know more about her childhood.
 
 Police said they will not arrest Sonu till Ashu’s MLC report suggests grievous internal injuries. “We are waiting for the report and have requested the woman to cooperate in the probe,” said Romil Baaniya, DCP (southeast).
