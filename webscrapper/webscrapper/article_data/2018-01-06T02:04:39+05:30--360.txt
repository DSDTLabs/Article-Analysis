GUWAHATI: Two couples, one Muslim and the other Bodo, in Assam’s Darrang district have decided not to part with their sons despite DNA tests confirming they got swapped at birth in 2015. The biological son of Sahabuddin Ahmed and   Parveen now lives as Rakesh Boro, the son of Anil and  . Similarly, Anil and Sewali Boro’s son lives as Zunaid in the Ahmed household. 

 Sewali and Salma both delivered sons on March 11, 2015, at Mangaldai Civil Hospital in Darrang. When time came to hand over the babies to the families, the nurses somehow mixed them up and the blunder went unnoticed for several days. 
 
 “A week after we came back from the hospital, I found my wife crying, saying the baby did not belong to her as he looked different. He had small eyes, a tribal feature,” Sahabuddin, a teacher, said. 
 
 Around the same time, the   had a similar experience. Sahabuddin approached the hospital, but his complaint about a mix-up was rejected. He then filed an   query seeking the names and addresses of all the women who delivered children at the hospital the day his wife did. “There was one Bodo woman in the RTI reply I received. I wrote to the couple about the possibility of a mix-up. They invited us home and, after seeing the babies, were convinced there had been a mix-up. Boro’s mother, however, refused to accept the truth,” Sahabuddin said. 
 
 He then approached the SP, who ordered an FIR in December 2015 and a DNA test. The test was conducted in April 2016 and the report came in November. But the results mean nothing to either. 
 
 “We have decided not to part with our son. I’ve raised Rakesh and breastfed him. How can I live without him?” Sewali said. Salma added, “We tried to see the reaction of the babies by swapping them, but they wouldn’t leave the mothers who raised them. We will not switch them again.”
