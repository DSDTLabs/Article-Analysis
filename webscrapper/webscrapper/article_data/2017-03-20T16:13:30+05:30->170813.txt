Actor  , who was last seen as a lead character on the show Bani...Ishq Da Kalma, will now make his comeback with 'Meri Durga'.   will be replacing Vishal Bhardwaj.
 
  Vishal has been replaced after just one scene as he couldn't match the requirements of the character.
  
  
 
  
  Talking about his comeback, Adhvik said, "Well, my last show as a leading man was   on Colors. After that, I have done a couple of films down south and also a few Hindi films. In fact, one will be releasing in May where I play a leading man. Besides, on TV I did an interesting multi-layered role in   a year ago."
  
  Adhvik's role on the show will be very strong and multi-shaded. "This role is special for me because it is my first outing as a suave, charming and a typical dashing hero on television. Having said that, there are many twists in the character, which, in a way, is quite new and challenging for me. I am going to really enjoy this one."
  
  During his break, Adhvik did some rather interesting things and turned into an entrepreneur. He says, "During the break from TV, I opened up a chain of multi-designer stores called   in  . But I didn't stop acting and I starred in 3 films. I was also honing my fighting and action skills. I'm already a pro in martial arts. To add to that, I learned sword fighting, horse riding and using the weapon nunchaku. So I have been pretty much occupied with life."
