MEERUT: Wading into troubled waters, the   (VHP) on Monday declared that it will launch a series of meetings in the entire country to unite Hindus on Ram temple in Ayodhya. The VHP's announcement came a day after   took over as the new chief minister of  . 

 The meetings, called as 'Ramotsava Sankalp Sabha', are meant to kindle awareness and unite Hindus for the cause of Ram temple in Ayodhya. VHP said it will organise rallies and 'aartis' between March 23 and April 11 as part of the movement.
 
 The Hindu outfit's members said that with BJP in power at the Centre and in the state, work on pursuing the agenda of construction of the Ram temple will begin this year itself.
 
 Gopal Sharma, VHP's   secretary, said: "We have got instructions from the VHP core committee to hold meetings, rallies and aartis in all the districts of the country. In these rallies, our main motive will be to make the Hindus aware about the reasons why   should be constructed in Ayodhaya-- the birth place of Lord Ram."
 
 The members claim that after the demolition of Babri, VHP supporters had gone from door-to-door and collected Rs 8 crore for the construction of the temple, which has been deposited in Shri Ram Bhumi Nyas Trust.
 
 "So funds will not be an issue for the temple," a VHP member said.
 
 "We already have funds in place in the form of Rs 8 crore that was collected after Babri was demolished. Now that BJP is in power at both Centre and in the state, it will be easy for a law to be passed in this regard, and once done, the temple will not take much time to be constructed.
 
 "The construction of the temple is going on. Its pillars are ready," said Sharma.
 
 The chief of Ram Janambhoomi Nyas trust, Nitya Gopal Das, recently announced that about 3/4th of the stone carving work is done.
