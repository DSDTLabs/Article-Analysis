LUCKNOW: A day after resigning from their council membership, two SP   Yashwant Singh and  , along with   legislator Thakur Jaiveer Singh joined the  , in the presence of deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, deputy chief minister Dr Dinesh Sharma and others, on Monday. 

 The way is now clear for the BJP to accommodate three of its five ministers as MLCs. BJP leaders claimed the former MLCs had joined the BJP without any pre-condition. Sources said Yashwant Singh is a close confidante of independent MLA from Kunda Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya, who is believed to have close contacts with BJP leaders as well as senior Sangh functionaries. 
 
 Though there had been speculations around Raja Bhaiyya joining the BJP, sources said it is very unlikely. Yashwant Singh said he joined the BJP as he was impressed by the functioning of Prime Minister   and reiterated there were no pre-conditions to his joining the party. Bukkal Nawab, who is accused in a few cases of land grabbing, also joined the party without conditions, said sources. 
 
 Sources said Thakur Jaiveer Singh holds sway over a sizeable chunk of voters in and around Aligarh and he or his family member might be compensated duly for the resignation, at the time of   elections. 
 
 All three MLCs resigned just before national BJP chief Amit Shah reached Lucknow on Saturday on a three-day visit and joined the party while he was in town and the co-incidence set the rumour mills abuzz, though as decided, Shah was not present when the three joined the party. 
 
 Whether any other   or BSP MLA or MLC would join the BJP too is not confirmed, while Shah stated categorically there was no proposal regarding SP leader Shivpal Yadav joining the party.
