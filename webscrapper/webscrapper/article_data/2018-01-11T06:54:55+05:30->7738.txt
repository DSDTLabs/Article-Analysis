GANDHINAGAR/BHARUCH: Amid   that could badly hit   and affect  , the   has requested the Centre to increase the discharge in the downstream of   from the present 600 cusecs to 1,500 cusecs.

 The Narmada river passing by Bharuch has dried up as little water is being released from the dam, a phenomenon that is being witnessed for the last two years. On Tuesday, the Dahej Industries Association met chief minister Vijay Rupani and apprised him about the grave situation of salinity ingress caused by sea water gushing into the dry riverbed.
 
 MS Dagur, additional chief secretary (ACS), Narmada department, has written an official letter to the Union ministry of environment, forest & climate change, seeking more discharge into the river. TOI has the copy of the letter.
 
 In January 2006, the environment sub-group of Narmada Control Authority decided that minimum 600 cusecs water would be released for 157 km downstream length .
 
 
 
 
 In January 2006, the environment sub-group of Narmada Control Authority (NCA) had decided that minimum 600 cusecs water would be released for 157 km downstream length either through river-bed power house (RBH) or through Godbole dates. However, the government has admitted that 600 cusecs water was not adequate to address the environment concerns.
 
 “Earlier, the total release of water in the downstream during a water year was quite significant because of riverbed power house operation, overflow during monsoon etc., and there was no significant adverse impact in the downstream. However, during last two years, because of limited running of RBPH, 600 cusecs being released through Godbole Gates is just not sufficient to meet the downstream environmental requirements,” Dagur wrote.
 
 The state government has received several representations from the MPs, affected people and NGOs, who have raised serious concerns on issues ranging from salinity ingress, poor water quality, water depth, width of flow, erosion to movement of boats.
