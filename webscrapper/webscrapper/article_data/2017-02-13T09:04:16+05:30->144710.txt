KOLHAPUR: The candidates contesting   and   elections can withdraw their nominations on Monday — the last day for doing so.

 Leaders, belonging to major political parties, are wooing independent candidates to withdraw their nominations to ensure victory for their candidates or faction. The voting for 67 members ZP is scheduled for February 21.
 
 All political parties, including Congress, NCP, BJP,   and Left, are busy campaigning and leaders of all these parties are touring every ZP and Panchayat Samiti segment to reach out to the people to woo them.
 
 The BJP, which did not have major presence in the local level politics in the district, was the first party to declare the list of candidates for Kolhapur ZP and Panchayat Samiti elections. The party has formed an alliance with the local factions and is banking on the support of these factions. However, the party has not yet released its manifesto for the election.
 
 The Congress — though delayed in releasing list of candidates contesting election on party ticket — is the first and only party that has released its manifesto for the ZP elections. The party focuses on health and infrastructural development in villages. Till date other parties have not published the manifesto, but have kick-started campaigning for the candidates. The parties are expected to publish the manifesto within two days.
 
 “Currently, we are keeping a watch on independent candidates and are trying to woo them to withdraw nominations on Monday which is the last date for the same so that it will be easy for our candidates to win the election. The situation is same with every party and all are eying on these candidates,” said a senior politician attached with the NCP.
