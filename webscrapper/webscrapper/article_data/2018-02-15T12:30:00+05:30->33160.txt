GAYA:   leader   Arya, who is also a member of the Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist), has been shifted to   under heavy police escort on Wednesday.

 A high security inmate of   Jail, Arya would be produced in Kharar sub-jail in connection with a 2011 case registered against him. He has been languishing in different jails of Bihar and Andhra Pradesh ever since his arrest in May 2011 from Katihar.
 
 The Maoist ideologue has over a dozen cases pending against him in different states including Pubjab, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Confirming Aryaâ€™s transfer to Punjab, a senior official of the Gaya Central jail said that he has been sent through road route. Jail sources said that he is unlikely to come back, as he has already been granted bail in cases registered against him with different police stations of Gaya district and he may be taken either to Sasaram or   as several cases have been registered against him in these two places.
 
 Jail officials are said to have heaved a sigh of relief following Arya's departure as, besides being a high security prisoner, Arya had emerged as a leader of Gaya jail inmates and insisted on implementation of the rights of the prisoners, undertrials as well as convicts, in respect of diet, health and other amenities. On several occasions, Arya had lodged formal complaints against jail officials.
