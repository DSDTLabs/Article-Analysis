NEW DELHI: A   involved in the   last month was apprehended at   on Friday. Police said the teenager, who operated out of  , plotted the crime to make his presence felt in the area.

 He used to carry two pistols and a machete to spread terror among other criminals in the area. He was wanted for several cases of murder and robbery.
 
 A team led by ACP (operations) K P Singh and inspector special staff, Rajinder Kumar was formed to track down the accused after inputs about him trying to kill other rivals were received. He was produced before a juvenile justice board and then sent to a reform home,” said Romil Baaniya, DCP (southeast).
 
 The juvenile, few months away from turning 18, wanted to “settle scores” with his rivals, Sunny and Bobby without being prosecuted as an adult. He earned his living by taking contracts from water-mafias operating in the area. He confessed to some of the murders, which the cops are yet to verify.
 
 In November, he had abducted Hemraj from Neb Sarai for a ransom of Rs 50,000. When Hemraj’s father could not arrange for the cash, he shot him and then buried the body in a pit in Neb Sarai. On December 3, he allegedly stabbed 18-year-old Firoz in Sangam Vihar 20 times with a screwdriver.
 
 After several raids at his hideouts, three of his associates were nabbed while he managed to escape. Hemraj’s body was exhumed and sent for a forensic examination which confirmed the bullet injury.
 
 A probe revealed that the juvenile’s father, who worked as a daily wager, did not live with the family while his mother earned her living working as a household help.
 
 He joined Sunny and his brother Bobby and committed a slew of crimes. But after a scuffle with Sunny in December, the juvenile plotted to kill both the brothers.
