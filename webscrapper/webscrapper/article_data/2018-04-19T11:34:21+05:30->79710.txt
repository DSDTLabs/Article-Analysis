NEW DELHI:   (AIMIM) president   on Wednesday said all those involved in terror attacks these days were ‘illegitimate’ children of  .

 
  “Terrorism has become a new religion in itself. All those who carried out bomb blasts in  , Ajmer Shareef and   express are illegitimate children of Nathuram Godse,” Owaisi said at a public meeting in Saidabad area of Telangana.
 
 Godse, an ex-RSS man, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948, shooting him at pointblank range.
 
  Speaking specifically about the Mecca Masjid blast verdict, Owaisi accused the BJP government of siding with the accused instead of the victims.
 
  “This is the first government in the country which has its loyalties towards blast accused rather than victims who lost their lives,” he said.
 
 
 
 
  The member of parliament from Hyderabad also claimed the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had acted at the behest of the BJP to go soft on the accused.
 
  “People say NIA is a caged parrot. To me, NIA is that parrot in the cage which is also blind and deaf,” Owaisi remarked.
 
  Demanding a retrial in the case, the AIMIM chief said he would soon meet the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Governor ESL Narasimhan to present facts related to the case.
 
  When the verdict came out on Tuesday, Owaisi was one of the first political leaders from the opposition to react and in no uncertain terms made it clear he felt justice was not done.
