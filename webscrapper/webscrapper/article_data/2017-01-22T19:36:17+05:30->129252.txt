KOLKATA: A fire broke out a   in Kolkata on   beside Purabi Cinema near   on Sunday evening. Eight fire tenders took more than two hours to bring the fire under control.

 Fire officials suspected the fire possibly started because of a short circuit in the showroom’s godown in the mezzanine floor of the shop that soon spread across the entire floor of the shop. The shop was situated at the ground floor of a building that houses a guest house – International Guest House – in the upper floors. As the fire spread, police evacuated the occupants of the guest house and sprayed water on the adjacent buildings to prevent the fire from spreading further.
 
  
  
 A senior fire official said the presence of large amount of combustible items in the form of rexine, cotton, jute, plastic and paper fuelled the fire that made it difficult for the fire officials to douse the flames. “The fact that the shop had a false ceiling made things difficult for the fire fighters to reach the seat of fire. We will inspect if the shop had proper firefighting measures and had followed the requisite fire precautionary norms,” said Sovan Chatterjee, the state fire minister.
 
 Fire officials said a thick black smoke was spotted billowing from the shop around 3.45pm. However, no one was injured in the incident. While the firemen were fighting the blaze, Howrah-bound traffic movement between Sealdah and MG Road crossing was stalled for close to two hours.
