NAGPUR: The   project of the   (DLSA) was flagged off on Monday from it’s office premises at Nyay Mandir, Civil Lines. The mobile court van was started as a part of the ‘Justice at your doorstep’ scheme of the judiciary which envisioned taking the legal remedies at the residences of the victims or aggrieved. 

 The concept was materialized by the DLSA to ensure the tenets of justice was taken to the ones who cannot easily avail them either due to economic constraint or shortages of resources or reach. The mobile court van would also meet the requirements of spreading the legal awareness among the weaker section of the society. On the first day, the mobile van visited several localities in city like Indora, Jaripatka and also RBI square for awareness. 
 
 Principal district and session judge  , also president of the DLSA, along with the DLSA secretary  , were among the dignitaries present for the occasion. They have appealed the masses to harness maximum utilities of the mobile court van. 
 
 The van, as it has been envisioned, would be moving around in various talukas and trying to cover maximum possible remote villages where they are expected to create legal awareness among the local population and also address their issues. The van is also expected to target an audience ranging from women to workers and backward sections of the society by organizing legal workshops and awareness camps for them. The mobile court would also try to redress various legal problems of the villagers and taluka-level population who often find it difficult to access the courts.
