Tuticorin: The   government should be allowed to appeal to get a better share in   river, state secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist),   has said. Addressing reporters after taking part in the party’s 22nd district conference on Friday, he welcomed the Supreme Court’s ruling that no state could claim exclusive rights over any river.

 However, he added that reduction in Tamil Nadu’s share in Cauvery from 192 tmc to 177.25 tmc cannot be accepted as it will have serious implications on farming operations in the delta region. He recalled that 192 tmc was a reduction of 13 tmc from the interim award of 205 tmc awarded by the  . “This is disappointing as the Tamil Nadu government sought 264 tmc water,” he said. 
 
 “State government should be allowed to appeal against this verdict,” he said and added that it should be heard afresh. He also welcomed the court’s ruling that neighbouring states could not construct any new reservoirs across the Cauvery without consent of Tamil Nadu.
