LUCKNOW:   may have approved 83 more mobile   in the city but the government recognised startup which is authorised to install them is facing difficulties with the first set of 20 machines, allegedly for want of support from government agencies. 

 Instead of the first 20 ATMs in the first phase,   is running only 13 because of alleged harassment by police and also the regional transport office’s (RTO’s) reluctance to register water e-carts on grounds that differently abled people don’t possess driving licenses. On April 8, when the scheme was flagged off by urban development minister Suresh Khanna from LMC’s head office in Lalbagh, he handed over seven such ATMs to differently abled people. The idea was to provide them with means of livelihood.
 
 Company founder Vineet Vats said, “RTO people are not registering their e-carts claiming they don’t possess driving license. So the entire effort to provide them livelihood remains defeated. Also those which are installed are facing harassment by police on the pretext that e-carts block traffic. Hundreds of other vendors park their carts on roadsides but no one hinders their work. Ours is a genuine, LMC-approved product but it is facing resistance by government agencies.” 
 
 Lucknow RTO AK Tripathi, however, said that the RTO is bound by rules which don’t provide for registration of vehicles in the name of differently abled people as they don’t posses driving license. Since the company has been authorised by LMC to vend water at public places, it is also liable to pay certain vending fees to it. Vats said, “We don’t mind paying vending fee to LMC but they should give us protection while on road so that we are not forced to move from our designated place.” 
 
 The company has installed water ATMs at markets and public places and targets to install 127 ATMs in Lucknow by July. The water ATM carries 300 litre water at a time and gives 250 ml of clean, drinking water in a recyclable glass when Rs 2 is deposited.
