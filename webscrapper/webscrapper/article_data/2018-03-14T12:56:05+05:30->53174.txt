CHANDRAPUR: A massive fire has been raging at garbage dumping yard of   (CMC) in the outskirts of the city since the last two days.

 The fire was first noticed on Tuesday evening in the dumping yard spread over 50 acres. The habitation in Asthbhuja ward and a section of the bypass road through the locality was engulfed with thick smoke rising from large piles of burning garbage.
 
 Commuters claimed to have burning sensation in the eyes and drop in visibility due to the thick smoke. The residents of   ward said fire in dumping yard is common during summer. 
 
 CMC has built a garden in a section of the dumping yard, where people go for morning and evening walks. However, no one visited the park on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the thick fumes.
 
 Mayor   claimed that cattle herders living in the neighborhood tend to set the dumping yard afire to deter their cattle from rummaging there. She directed the officials to identify the culprits and file police complaint against them.
 
 CMC has still not allotted the work for segregation of garbage at dumping yard and compost making from it. Tenders for the work were summoned twice, but were cancelled both the time before bidding was finalized.
 
 Two companies have offered their services for the work. While one has quoted the rate of Rs799 per tonne of garbage treatment, other company has offered to work free of cost provided it gets ample land and water for the work.
 
 Standing committee chairman   claimed that they have directed the officials to study the feasibility of the claim of the company offering to work free of cost.
