CHENNAI: Sewage-contaminated drinking water supplied by Metrowater has put   residents at risk of infection. While supply by Metrowater was stopped at least three months ago in several parts of the locality, residents still use hand pumps connected to Metrowater lines to draw water. These pumps draw only foul-smelling water which is not even fit for washing.

 An official said “Triplicane residents are supplied water through tankers. We have stopped supply due to water shortage. Residents may be pumping water from the bottom levels of the supply channel. It may be contaminated.” 
 
 A few hundred homes spread across Fakir Sahib Street, Chella Pillayar Koil Street and the surrounding working-class neighbourhoods depend on these hand pumps. Triplicane resident   said, “We only get a few pots of water a day from the water tankers. It is never sufficient for us.” Groundwater levels have plummeted in Triplicane and residents are sinking bore wells to depths up to 200feet.
 
 S   dug a 120-feet deep bore well on Saturday at a cost of Rs 40,000. “I am not sure if the well will yield water. It depends on luck.” Six months ago, Rajan dug a bore well but found no water. Mahalakshmi has a similar tale. 
 
 Triplicane residents used to receive 6 million litres per day (MLD), but supply was slashed to 3 MLD three months ago. The official said, “We will resume regular supply in a month or two. If the north east monsoon begins well, we will resume regular supply sooner.”
