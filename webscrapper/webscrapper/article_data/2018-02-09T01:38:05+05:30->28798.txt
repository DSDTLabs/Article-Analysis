NEW DELHI: In a corruption case involving   officers and private builders/companies, the CBI on Thursday arrested two senior executives of Noida-based 3C Universal Developers Pvt Ltd and an assistant   commissioner in a   case involving Rs 5 lakh. 

 The arrested persons include, assistant provident fund commissioner Surender Kumar; 3C Universal Developers executive Santosh Kumar, and the chief financial officer of the company Dinesh Pahwa, CBI said. 
 
 The company has built several residential projects in NCR. CBI had received information that APFC Surender Kumar was allegedly in the habit of demanding illegal gratification from various private parties in the name of regional provident fund commissioner by providing them relief in the cases of violation of provident fund provisions.
 
 Pahwa engaged Surender Kumar through Santosh Kumar for seeking favours in the matters of the company relating to delay in deducting, depositing and filing returns of employee provident fund and not taking action for delay in mandatory deduction and not filing the return, a FIR filed in the case has alleged.
 
 Surender Kumar assured that no action would be taken against Pahwa and demanded a bribe of Rs 10-15 lakh for the alleged favour, the agency has alleged. It was decided that first instalment of Rs 5 lakh would be paid on February 7 (yesterday), it said.
 
 The agency laid a trap and arrested Santosh Kumar, Surender Kumar and Dinesh Pahwa while exchanging the bribe, the sources said.
