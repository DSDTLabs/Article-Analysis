CHENNAI: Alleging that Bangalore based S  , who has moved the   seeking to undergo DNA test to prove that she is the biological daughter of former chief minister J  , is canvassing unproven details and is seeking a roving inquiry which is unsustainable by law, the   wanted the court to dismiss the plea as not maintainable.

 Recently, the high court ordered notice to the Apollo hospitals, where late chief minister J Jayalalithaa was hospitalised till she was declared dead on December 5, 2016, in relation to the case.
 
 Filing its counter affidavit in the plea, the state government submitted that the petitioner’s claim that the former chief minister visited her on many occasions during visits to Bengaluru, and stayed with her could not be verified, due to efflux of time and that there is no proof available with the government to show that Jayalalithaa visited the petitioner between 2007 and 2008.
 
 This apart, there is no evidence available with the government to prove the petitioner’s claim that she visited Jayalalithaa at her   residence and stayed there, the affidavit added.
 
 To the claim that the former chief minster was not laid to rest properly as per her religious customs, the state in its counter claimed, “Former chief minister was laid to rest on   with full state honours by the state government, with guard of honour and with human dignity, as enshrined in the Constitution. At the time of burial, neither the petitioner, nor any other relative of Jayalalithaa made any request to follow any specific rituals or rites.”
 
 Pointing out the sworn affidavit filed by Jayalaithaa dated April 25, 2016 with the returning officer of R K Nagar assembly constituency during the May 2016 assembly election, the state said, the former chief minister herself had declared that she had no spouse or dependants, which clearly shows that the claim of the petitioner to be utterly false.
