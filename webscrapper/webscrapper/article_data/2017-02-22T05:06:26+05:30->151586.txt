MUMBAI: A fierce fight appears to be on between   and   in the Marathi-dominated south central Mumbai localities of Dadar, Parel, Lalbaug and parts of Mahim, which saw the birth and growth of both parties. 

 These localities have also recorded a high turnout in every election over the years, especially civic polls. 
 
 The G-North Ward of Shivaji Park recorded 53% while the neighbouring G-South Ward of Prabhadevi and Mahalaxmi saw 53%. 
 
 Every party, especially Sena and MNS, had selected strong candidates as this ward is a matter of prestige. The Sena took shape in this very locality in 1966.
 
 The Sena has fielded an old hand, Vishakha Raut, who was the mayor in 1997 and also a former MLA representing the same area, though she was nowhere in the picture for the past 10 years. All this, to defeat first-time   candidate Swapna Deshpande, wife of Sandeep Deshpande, sitting corporator from the area.
 
 In Prabhadevi, Sena’s Samadhan Sarvankar, MLA Sada Sarvankar’s son, got the seat in place of shakha pramukh Mahesh Sawant, who is contesting as an independent candidate. 
 
 The split of votes between the two may benefit MNS candidate Santosh Dhuri who currently represents the ward in the BMC.
 
 Although the major fight in the island city would between the Sena, BJP and  , MNS in Dadar and AIMIM in Byculla may get some space to raise their voice in the civic house. 
 
 The voting percentage of slums and old chawls where Sena has a significant touch is much higher than that of highrise voters.
