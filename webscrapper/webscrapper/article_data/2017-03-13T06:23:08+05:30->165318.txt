SURAT:   (SMC) will shortly construct an intake well in Tapi riverbed at  , some 28km from the city. It plans to draw at least 600 MLD of water from this intake well and supply it to treatment plants in Varachha and Rander before reaching it to people. This will take the number of SMC’s intake wells to eight. Surat municipality used to supply 10 million litres per day (MLD ) of water to Rander area of the city from Varachha waterwork which was located outside the city limits way back in 1897. An officer of hydraulic department of   said, “The waterwork must be situated beyond the city limits to counter pollution caused by urbanization.”

 Municipal commissioner   visited the place a few days ago. “Guy Pagla is a suitable place for the intake well. The water would be drawn and supplied through pipelines to the treatment plants in the city,”   said. 
 
 A pipeline would be diverted to   while bringing the water to Rander from Guy Pagla to cater to new areas of the city in future. This is because Surat city which measures 326 sq km in area is likely to expand to 500 sq km in the next 20 years. The second pipeline would go to Bhesan to meet the needs of people living in the south west zone of the city. 
 
 “Areas of Katargam-Varachha, Rander and Adajan which are getting   would be supplied pure water once this intake well becomes operational,” another SMC officer said.
