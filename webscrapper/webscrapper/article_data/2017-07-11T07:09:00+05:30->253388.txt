GURUGRAM: After fixing the city’s three major drains,   has now decided to clean all   along city roads to check   by allowing rainwater to flow out smoothly. 

 Officials said most of the stormwater drains in the city are  .
 
 “There are outlets and passage along all city roads for flow of rainwater into stormwater drains. They are designed in a way to take rainwater from roads to the main drainage line. But in many places, these outlets and passages are blocked with waste, obstructing the flow of rainwater. So, we will soon start cleaning these drains,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav.
 
 The urban development body has already completed cleaning of all the three major drains — Leg 1, Leg 2 and Badshapur. The Badshapur drain, in particular, has been widened and deepened at a few places in Khandsa village, to increase its water holding capacity.
 
 “Cleaning and widening of the main drainage lines will not be effective if rainwater is flowing into these blocked stormwater drains,” Yadav said.
 
 Apart from the cleaning of stormwater drains, officials said desilting of Najafgarh drain would also deal with waterlogging. Najafgarh drain is the outlet for Badshapur drain and the decision to clean the drain was taken few days back at a meeting chaired by Union urban development secretary Durga Shankar Mishra.
 
 “Cleaning of stormwater drains, widening of Badshapur drain and now disilting of Najafgarh drain will all help in averting waterlogging in Gurgaon,” Yadav said.
