PANAJI: Union minister for railways   on Tuesday asserted that in the next 10-15 years, India would be one of the top three economic powers in the world, but for it to achieve that goal, a multi-modal coastal transport remained a vital cog. 

 Speaking while commissioning   ship Shaunak at   Limited, Prabhu said that coastal security was key for India’s security and economic prosperity. “I believe that based on the way our economy is growing, in 10-15 years India will be the second or third largest economy in the world. Trade has always been an important factor for economic development and international trade will be equally important,” Prabhu said.
 
 The Union railways minister went on to add that the   had to be well-equipped and always prepared to protect the country’s international trade and transport interests. “Even domestic trade, most of it will happen along the coast, shipment of cargo will be along the coast and for this it is important to protect the coast. Our marine biodiversity is also protected by the Coast Guard,” Prabhu said.
 
 Most of India’s import and export trade passes through the country’s major shipping ports along the eastern and western coast. “Railways link everybody and quite a large part of the rail network runs along the coast and in a way, the Coast Guard helps protect this rail network. Multi-modal transportation is going to be an important thing. Rail infrastructure is susceptible and to protect it, among the other agencies, the Coast Guard also helps ,” Prabhu said.
 
 Shaunak is a 105m off-shore patrol vessel indigenously built by Goa Shipyard. It is equipped with navigation and communication equipment and is designed to carry a twin-engine light helicopter and five high-speed boats including two quick-reaction inflatable boats for swift boarding operations, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol.
 
 The ship will be based at Visakhapatnam.
