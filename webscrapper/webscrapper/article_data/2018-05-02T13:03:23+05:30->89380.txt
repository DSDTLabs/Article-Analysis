CHENNAI: Days after the Madras high court dismissed a plea seeking their disqualification, O Panneerselvam and the 10 MLAs who stood by him during the February 2017 revolt against the Sasikala camp, filed a caveat in the   on Tuesday, anticipating a petition from the DMK. Questioning the delayed order and the HC's refusal to interfere, DMK working president M K Stalin had said the fight would continue in the Supreme Court. 

 The Madras high court last week dismissed the DMK plea seeking disqualification of OPS and 10 MLAs for having violated the party whip and voted against the   government's trust vote. "Caveat is a protection, else the case will be decided without hearing our side. We want to ensure that we are heard," said minister K Pandiarajan, one of the 10 MLAs, who switched loyalty to OPS. Incidentally, OPS had directed the MLAs to stay away from media and not to comment on the court verdict. The case was filed by the DMK with political vengeance despite knowing there were several rulings in the past about the powers of speaker,   spokesperson   said.
 
 The bench headed by chief justice   said that in view of the fact that the question of issuance of mandamus on the speaker was pending consideration of the Supreme Court, it was difficult to conceive how the court can disqualify the MLAs concerned and render the proceedings in the SC infructuous. "Passing of such orders would not only amount to judicial overreach, it would also amount to gross breach of judicial discipline, if not contempt," the order said.
