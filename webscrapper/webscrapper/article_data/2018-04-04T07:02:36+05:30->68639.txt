KOCHI: Members of the   said that septage waste is being dumped into   and authorities concerned are turning a blind eye towards the issue.

 “Rampant dumping and   and septage into the Kadambrayar has more or less killed the river and have poisoned the   of the once considered freshwater source in the district,” said M N Giri, a member of Kadambrayar Samrakshana Samithi. Kadambrayar starts from Kizhakambalam wetlands and around 40 streams join together to form the river. It passes through Kizhakambalam, Kunnathunadu, Mardau, Thiruvaniyoor, Chottanikkara, Tripunithura and Thrikkakara. Around 80% of the two – kilometre stretch from Brhamapuram Bridge to Kozhichira as well as Manakkankadavu, Edachira canal are theworst polluted, said Giri.
 
 Rakesh, who resides on the banks of Kadambrayar, said that waste from slaughter house is also being dumped into the river. “Foul smell emanating from the river has become a menace to us. Few days ago, the presence of industrial effluents were also found. Earlier there were fish kills and these days you can hardly find any fish,” he said.
