GUWAHATI: A woman allegedly killed her seven-month-old son by throwing him into a well in central   at Raha in  , some 101 km from here. 

 The mother, identified as Bhanumoti Sarma, has already been arrested on charges of murder and sent to jail later in the day. 
 
 Nagaon SP Debaraj Upadhaya told TOI that the mother claimed that the baby fell into the well accidentally. "The possibility of the baby falling into the well accidentally was very low as the well has four feet high rings above the ground," the SP said. 
 
 He added that the seven- month-old boy was slightly weaker than a normal baby due to some health issues during his birth. "Due to the child's poor health condition, the family was undergoing tremendous tension and the woman and her husband used to have heated arguments often," said a source. 
 
 He added that on Monday morning, a girl from the neighbourhood was playing with the kid. Suddenly, the mother came running to the girl, snatched the baby from her and then rushed to the well and then allegedly threw him. 
 
 The family members, too, alleged that she was threatening to kill the child for a long time. The father of the child, Dilip Sarma, said that she was not happy with the kid as it was unable to move freely and was having problem with normal activities.
