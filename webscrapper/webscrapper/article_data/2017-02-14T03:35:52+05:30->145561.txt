NEW DELHI: The   on Monday refused to entertain a fresh plea questioning the procedure adopted by   to recommend three names from which the President would choose one to succeed   (retired) as vice-chancellor.

 Advocate   alleged that the procedure adopted by AMU to shortlist three names did not conform to the University Grants Commission’s norms and expressed doubt whether the three persons had the requisite academic qualifications. 
 
 The   had prescribed that vice-chancellor of a central university must have at least 10 years experience as professor.
 
 AMU’s counsel Raju Ramachandran told a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice N V Ramana that all three names sent to the President had the requisite UGC qualification and there was no irregularity in the shortlisting. 
 
 On the basis of Ramachandran’s statement, the SC disposed of Bhushan’s plea but said the main contention — whether AMU was a minority institution or not — would be decided later.
