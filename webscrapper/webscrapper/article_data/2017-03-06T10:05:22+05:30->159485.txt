LUCKNOW: Senior   leader   on Sunday said UP Minister Gayatri Prasad   should   from the cabinet and surrender before the police as he was named accused in a gangrape case registered on the directions of the Supreme Court.

 “He should resign from the cabinet and surrender,” said Agarwal in response to a question during a press conference in Lucknow on Sunday morning, hours before UP Governor   shot a letter to the chief minister seeking a clarification on Gayatri’s being retained in the cabinet.
 
 Talking about Prime Minister’s roadshow in Varanasi, Agarwal said the fact that Narendra Modi and other senior BJP leaders where camping in the temple town was clear indication that the saffron brigade was scared of losing. “Or why else would the PM with almost his entire cabinet camp in Varanasi if the party is so confident of forming the government in UP,” he said.
 
 About the prospects of SP-Congress alliance, he said the two parties will form the next government with a clear majority. “The impressive crowd that came out during the Akhilesh-Rahul roadshow in Varanasi on Saturday was testimony of how people of Varanasi region will vote in the final phase of the elections,” he said.
