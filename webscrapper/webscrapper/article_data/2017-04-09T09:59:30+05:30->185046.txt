PANAJI: The mortal remains of human rights activist and lawyer,  , were consigned to flames at the city crematorium on Saturday morning. Sonak’s wife and well-known artist Harshada Kerkar lit the funeral pyre, as slogans from his emotional friends rent the air during the last rites.

 As one of the speakers noted, the ‘morcha’ from his residence to the crematorium was the last one for a man involved in leading them for a host of causes. 
 
 A few prominent citizens, including his brother and high court judge, Justice Mahesh Sonak, social activist Aires Rodrigues, Nandkumar Kamat, Avinash Bhonsle and Subhodh Kerkar recalled his fight for justice for the downtrodden, human rights, good governance, integrity in public life and environmental issues.
 
 Many citizens wanted to speak on the occasion, but it was decided to have a special condolence meet in the city on April 15 to pay tributes to Sonak
 
 Among the issues Sonak will be remembered for include the cause of the Vanarmare tribals from Nirancal. After he filed a complaint with the Goa Human Rights Commission demanding compensation and police protection after their hutments were vandalized in October last year, the ostracized tribe received aid in cash and kind from society and also, for the first time, their voting rights. 
 
 Being associated with the Gujarat-based organization Anam Prem, Sonak helped organize a number of trips to Goa for less privileged sections of society, including transgenders from Maharashtra, MP, Orissa, New Delhi and   in 2012. 
 
 The human rights activist was barely concerned about the consequences when he defied authorities and took up public issues. “He took the oppressed, suppressed and those in need under his wing without waiting for someone to ask him to do so,” close friend Manoj Joshi told STOI.
