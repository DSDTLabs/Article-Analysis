KOLHAPUR: The   (MIF), a farmers’ body, took out a rally outside the   office of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) and threatened to gherao the Mantralaya if the state government fails to revoke the  , implemented from April 1, 2017.

 While addressing the rally, MIF president ND Patil said, “The recent hike is against the farmer community and should be cancelled. We will form a human chain and gherao the Mantralaya (secretariat) if the government fails to revoke this decision.”
 
 He added, “We have decided to organise a protest march in Karad and Pune. The state power minister gave us wrong figures on defaulting power bills. He also lied about disconnection of agricultural connections. Therefore, a privilege motion should be admitted in the legislative assembly.”
 
 Vikram Patil Kinikar, Kolhapur president of the federation, said, “Apart from the current power tariff, the power supply is very erratic and it causes difficulty in irrigating the fields. On this back drop we have demanded stable power supply. The recent hike in   is brutal and should be revoked with immediate effect. The government should bear additional expenses and provide power at subsidised rates.”
 
 More than 2,000 farmers participated in the rally and shouted slogans against the government.
 
 Prabhakar Kolekar, a farmer from Karveer taluka, said, “We are engaged in agriculture despite losses. It is our only option of survival, but government does not want the farmers to live without any difficulty. It hardly think about our welfare. The recent hike in power tariff is additional burden on us and should be revoked.”
 
 M G Shinde, chief engineer (CE) of Kolhapur zone of MSEDCL, said, “We have received their petition of demands and would summit to our company headquarters in Mumbai.”
