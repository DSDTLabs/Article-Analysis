GURUGRAM: Animal lovers have expressed serious concerns over the rise in illegal hunting of wild animals and birds using pellets and blade wires.

  of   (PFA), said that over 60 birds and animals —  ,   — have been victims of illegal hunting, road accidents, electrocution and illegal blade wire fencing since January this year.
 
 In April this year, two nilgais, aged around eight to nine years, died after being shot with a country-made gun in the Aravalis. The male and the female antelopes were found in Mahendergarh and Bilaspur areas, respectively, with bullet injuries to their abdomen. They were soon rushed to Sardana, an animal shelter run by the Gurgaon centre of People for Animals, but they succumbed to their injuries after a 48-hour battle for survival.
 
 Chaudhery, president of PFA-Gurgaon, told TOI, “Killing of nilgai is rampant in Gurgaon and in most cases, it is not even reported. Local people hire hunters to kill the antelopes. These hunters use country-made guns to kill the wild animals.”
 
 “The increasing number of deaths of nilgais and other wild animals point towards the large-scale organised destruction of Gurgaon forests, in which the forest and wildlife department is complicit,” he added.
 
 While over 10 sightings of leopards have been confirmed by the wildlife department in the past year, the department conducted successful rescue operations at least four times last year. In November 2016, villagers killed a leopard in Mandawar after it attacked eight people in the village. MD Sinha, conservator of forests (Gurgaon circle), said, “The Aravalis need a comprehensive wildlife management plan. We need to conserve the Aravalis first so that human interference is limited in the wildlife zone.”
 
 “Also, we need to build enough water holes in forest area so that wildlife doesn’t venture out in search of water. Most importantly, there is a need to spread awareness to be a wildlife sensitive society,” he added.
