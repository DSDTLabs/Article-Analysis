CHANDIGARH: Presiding over the budget session of the Haryana assembly on Monday, governor   said that the state government would keep pursuing the SYL canal issue and do its best to protect the interests of the people in the state. 

 “The government will earnestly keep pursuing the matter and shall do its best to protect the interests of the hard-working and law-abiding people of our state, who have faith in our  ,” he said while addressing MLAs on the first day of the session. Concerted efforts have resulted in a favourable verdict (on the SYL issue) from the Supreme Court on Presidential reference and this has paved the way to initiate the long-pending construction of the remaining portion of the canal, Solanki said.
 
 He said it was heartening that on November 28 last year an all-party delegation from   to the President, seeking his intervention to ensure that state gets its rightful and legitimate share in surplus Ravi-Beas waters.
 
 On the other hand, opposition parties sought a longer duration to discuss the issues related to the alleged land and lease scams, SYL canal and Jat reservation. Leader of opposition   of the INLD sought an extension of the session for two more days. Former Haryana speaker Raghbir Kadian and MLA Kuldeep Sharma, both of Congress, accused the BJP government of conducting a shorter session just to avoid being embarrassed.
 
 “Issue related to Gwal Pahari, lease of HUDA-owned resort and purchase of electricity meters from a blacklisted firm are directly related to the chief minister as he is the incharge of the departments concerned, hence the speaker and advisory committee chose to have shorter sessions,” alleged Sharma.
 
 He further said, “Similarly, the government is in no mood to sort out issues related to the Jat reservation. We have requested for calling attention motion as the government has tried to manipulate at various places. Moreover, these allegations have not come from us but from BJP MLAs only.”
