NAGPUR: City’s   was nervous when the auction for   started. The thought of ‘what if none of the franchise buys me’ kept haunting him. When Shubham went unsold on the first day, the jitteriness doubled up.

 
 
 His hopes went downhill as the auctions were nearing the end. Finally, the swift raider heaved a sigh of relief when   bought him for the forthcoming edition at the price of 8 lakh.
 
 “I was nervous on both the days. You never know what is going to happen until you get picked by a team. It is a matter of luck. I feel very lucky that I have been picked up by Gujarat,” Shubham said on Friday.
 
 “Frankly speaking, the price of 8 lakh doesn’t matter much to me. These are the unique opportunities to scale higher and improve as a player,” he added.
 
 The 21-year-old is known for his swift raids and dives. The raider had impressed many teams when he was with   in the last edition. Currently, the skipper of city’s renowned kabaddi club —  , Mahal, — is working hard on his fitness as a lengthy Pro Kabaddi season is in the offing.
 
 “Amidst the glamour of Pro Kabaddi, there is a lot of hard work. I am focusing on fitness right now. A lot of special drills need to be done before you enter such a highly competitive championship,” said Shubham, who had played 6 games for Delhi last year.
 
 Though Pro Kabaddi has seen a decent participation from city players in previous seasons, Shubham feels many Vidarbha players could play the franchise-based tournament.
 
 “I feel Vidarbha has many talented players who can play at the top level. The specialty of Vidarbha players is their fearlessness. Since we play on the soil, we become tougher and develop daring to take on any team. If players from this region get more exposure, many would play the league,” Shubham opines.
 
 The raider feels tournaments like Khasdar Krida Mahotsav should take place regularly. It will give opportunity to the players to become confident for the next level.
