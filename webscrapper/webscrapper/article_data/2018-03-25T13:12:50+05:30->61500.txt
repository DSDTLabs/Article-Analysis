MANGALURU: The third additional district and sessions court on Saturday acquitted all three accused in the murder of a   activist in 2014. 

 On March 21, 2014, swords were used by the perpetrators to murder Bajrang Dal activist  , who was an autorickshaw driver in Bantwal. He died while being rushed to hospital.
 
 Judge   acquitted Irshad 23, Imran, 21 and Hussain, 23, all residents of Malloor, as the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them. 
 
 “The prosecution failed to prove the case. There was no corroboration of statements. Also, the eyewitnesses gave contradictory statements to the police and the court. Moreover, there were two spots for mahajar located within 3km from each other. Instead of visiting both on the same day, the police did the mahajar on separate days, with a long gap in between. These incidents created a bundle of doubts in the mind of the court,” Shashiraj Rao Kavoor, the defence counsel, told STOI.
 
 Rajesh was accused of murdering a person named Iqbal. However, he was acquitted in the case. Based on a police complaint filed by his wife H S Pallavi, the police had begun investigating the case.
 
 The police from the Bantwal station arrested Irshad, Imran and Hussain in connection with this case. Suspecting foul play, the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) had begun intense protests after the youth were arrested. The case was later handed over to the CID.
 
 On March 31, 2014, the police filed a chargesheet. The prosecution had produced 24 witnesses and 47 documents before the court.
 
 “We knew all three accused were innocent. The police had arrested them under pressure, hence, we had stood by them. We believed in the court and it has delivered justice. Truth has triumphed,”  , state president, DYFI, said.
