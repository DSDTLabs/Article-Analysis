Action films are a completely different challenge and  , who has done romantic comedies and dramas in the past, has figured out that it’s not easy. He admits, “Before ' ', I had not done a role which required me to do action. I have never picked up a gun or even killed a fly in my life (laughs!). In this film, I am cocking two guns and shooting two people while I am driving a car. How cool is that? Doing action gives you a different high altogether.”

 Ask him what goes into training for an action film and Saqib says, “I’m not even going to count the hours you have to spend in the gym. If you are doing a film like this, you have to be in the best shape. Senior actors like  ,   and   are in the film and they’re all super fit. So, I have to be as fit, if not more, because I am younger. I am supposed to kick, jump, punch and shoot people and it should look authentic. I have undergone a lot of kick-based training for this role and it was so taxing that after a point, I didn’t have any sensation in one side of my body. Also, the film has Daisy Shah and Jacqueline Fernandez, who are brilliant with action, so I realised I had a lot to learn.”
 
 He believes that 'Race 3' will give him the best Eidi yet. He says, “Ever since I became an actor, I wanted my film to release on Eid. This release slot is always taken up by Salman Khan, but since I am part of 'Race 3', my wish is finally coming true.”
