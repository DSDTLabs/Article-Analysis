HYDERABAD:   does not respect actresses, they are only showpieces in movies, said  , in an event conducted at Lamakaan on Sunday about sexual harassment at workplace.

 The panel was discussing several forms of sexual harassment that women face in the workplace, focusing on Telugu film industry. Apart from Sri Reddy, actress Apoorva and academic-activist   were also part of the discussion.
 
 “Almost all Tollywood directors have asked for sexual favours. Most actresses are not coming out and saying this aloud fearing for their reputation and career. There is sexism even in pay. If an actor is paid Rs 10 crore, actresses will get hardly a crore," Sri Reddy said speaking to TOI. During the discussion, panelists specified that sexual harassment at workplace is based on power equation between the victim and the offender.
 
 “People say that sexual harassment happens everywhere. Actors are looked upon as icons, but they remain silent during any untoward incident, which needs to be changed,” said Sujatha Surepally.
 
 Panelists said that when sexual harassment in Telugu industry is termed as ‘casting couch’, it ‘normalises’ harassment.
 
 “Whenever a woman speaks up about being sexually harassed by strong and high profile people, it is termed as a publicity stunt. The question then arises, why is the blame put back on the victim. It is not easy to fight back. It affects the reputation of the actress and the word spreads that a particular actress is arrogant and a troublemaker,” said actress Aproova.
