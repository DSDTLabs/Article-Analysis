DEHRADUN: A day after the   (BSP) announced its list of 50 candidates for Uttarakhand, BJP leaders claimed that the social-engineering of ‘Behenjee’ had little chance of working in the state. Claiming that voters in the state are politically mature and will not fall for the formula applied by BSP in UP, BJP leader Khajan Das, who is seeking a ticket from the Rajpur (reserved) constituency, said, “The so-called social engineering done by the BSP while preparing its list of candidates, will not work in this election because people of Uttarakhand want overall development.”
 
  In 2012, BSP had secured 12.19% votes and had won three seats in Haridwar district. This year, one of the   has joined Congress while Mamta Rakesh, wife of the second winner,   who passed away after an illness, has also joined the Congress party. Sarvat Kareem Ansari, the third is the sole leader who would be contesting from the party.
  
  BSP leaders said they were upbeat about winning more seats in the election. “All the tickets have been given to the winning candidates and the party will do great in the coming elections. The distractors have already been weeded out of the party,” said BSP leader Satish Kumar. But BJP doesn’t share the enthusiasm. BJP leader Puneet Mittal said, “Uttarakhand has never been a stronghold of BSP in both the state and parliamentary elections. The BSP list clearly shows the little preparedness and seriousness of the party about the hill state.” Explaining the reason for the BSP’s decline in Uttarakhand, BJP leader Sajjad Shams said, “There is a basic difference in the SC community in Uttarakhand because they are more educated and aware of their rights in the hill state than they are in UP.”
