NEW DELHI: Yoga guru and Patanjali founder   on Thursday invoked cow slaughter to argue against  , the top grosser in the brand’s portfolio. The levy on on   has been increased from 5% to 12% under GST. This will not only increase prices of one kilogram of ghee by Rs 40-50 but will also impact Patanjali’s ghee sales by around 50%, said senior executives at the Haridwar-based FMCG firm. Cow ghee contributes 15% (Rs 1,467 crore) to Patanjali’s overall revenue. Patanjali makes disinfectant from cow urine and fertilisers from dung. While it has already launched milk powder, it will soon start selling packaged cow milk. “When the livelihood of lakhs of farmers and cowherds are at stake, I am sure the government will take notice,” said Ramdev.
