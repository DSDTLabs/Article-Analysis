Bengaluru: A 13-year-old Class 7 student in a private school committed suicide on Wednesday, because he was allegedly bullied by his classmates.  Police said Vikas Raja Singh killed himself in his house in Dasanapura in Nelamangala, around 40km from Bengaluru. Sources said the family had moved from Periyapatna near Mysuru to Dasanapura in 2015. The child’s father, Raja Singh, is a floor manager in a private biscuit factory on Tumakuru Road, while his mother, Veda Bai, works in a private food manufacturing unit in Nelamangala. Veda found Vikas hanging from the ceiling fan when she returned from work at 6pm on Wednesday. The 13-year-old left behind a note in Kannada accusing his classmates of bullying him. Madanayakanahalli police said they would question the school principal and a few students. “The note indicates that Vikas was depressed as he was constantly bullied and his class teacher would take him to task for no mistake of his. His parents told us that Vikas often shared the pain of becoming a target,” police said. Vikas joined the private school in Class 6, after the family moved to Dasanapura. Vikas struggled to adjust to the new atmosphere, his parents told police. Police said they have not registered any complaint against the school or the management yet. The investigation is on.
