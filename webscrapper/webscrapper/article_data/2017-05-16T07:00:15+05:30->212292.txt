MUMBAI: Maharashtra rural development minister  's followers were defeated in crucial elections to the   agricultural produce market committee ( ) by the supporters of her cousin, Dhananjay Munde.

 Pankaja, the daughter of deceased   veteran Gopinath Munde, has been reeling under a string of successive electoral defeats on her home turf, Beed.
 
 Out of 18 seats, Dhananjay's panel won 14 seats by a huge margin and lost the remaining seats to Pankaja's panel by a narrow margin.The elections assumed significance as Dhananjay and   had left no stone unturned to wrest control over the APMC. In the last month's election to the Ambajogai APMC too, Dhanan jay  's panel secured a clear majority. Dhananjay was Gopinath Munde's blueeyed boy and seen as his poli tical legatee. However, Gopinath later chose to promote Panjaka as his successor. “The NCP and Congress con tested the elections together and won unexpectedly. BJP had launched a high-powered campaign for the elections. Under such circumstances, we were unsure of victory, but the people voted in favour of Dhananjay Munde's panel,“ said a NCP leader.
 
 In the municipal council polls, NCP won 27 seats, followed by BJP (4) and Shiv Sena and Congress won one seat each. In the panchayat samiti elections in Parli tehsil, the NCP-led panel won handsomely. In the zilla parishad polls, out of 60 seats NCP won 24, followed by BJP (19) and Congress (3).
 
 “In view of successive poll defeats in Beed district, BJP will have to redraft its strategy to take on Dhananjay MundeIf the trend continues, then it will be difficult for the BJP to retain seats in the 2019 assembly polls," a BJP minister said.
