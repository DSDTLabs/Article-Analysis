NEW DELHI:   members of a gang of   who were cheating   in Lutyens’ Delhi were arrested from Janpath on Friday. The accused were selling cheap artificial jewellery as precious gem stones to tourists.

 Police said that the arrested men are brothers and have been identified as Tariq Ahmad (37) and Gulzar Ahmad (37), both natives of Kashmir.
 
 Cops added that the gang came on their radar after multiple complaints were received via email from foreign nationals who had come to Delhi for holidays. The tourists told police that a group of men met them while they were passing through Lutyens’ Delhi and cheated them by offering sightseeing packages or taking them to shops selling fake products at exorbitant prices.
 
 DCP (New Delhi) Madhur Verma said that a team of special staff was deployed in busy areas of central Delhi in plain clothes to track the movement of the gang. On Friday, they noticed two men outside the hotel talking to a group of tourists and trying to sell them sightseeing packages.
 
 Senior police officers said that the accused would sell the tourists offered them luxury services at nominal rates. However, later the tourists would find the services substandard. Similarly, they would take them to shops selling artefacts where the tourists would be cheated.
 
 To avoid detection, the accused only came to Delhi during tourist season and stayed in Kashmir through the year.
