Chennai: Several senior citizens who queued up in front of   bus depots on New year day to renew their free bus passes had to return home disappointed, unable to produce the additional identity proofs sought. 

 Launched in February 2016, the free bus ride scheme for senior citizens was one of the signature programmes launched by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa . 
 
 Under the scheme, tokens are issued to the beneficiaries on a quarterly basis using which they can travel free of cost on all MTC buses, except air-conditioned services. More than 1.93 lakh beneficiaries avail these coupons every year. Besides the token, an photo-ID card is issued to all applicants, to ensure only eligible candidates benefit. The number of tokens issued is entered on the ID cards and users renew them annually. 
 
  Without prior intimation, MTC now wants the applicants to return these discarded ID proofs along with photocopies of their Aadhaar and ration cards, he added.
 
 “We usually dispose of the ID card every December as it does not have the space to record beyond that,” said Jayaram Sivaram of the T Nagar Resident Welfare Association. “No such procedure was in place when we renewed it last year, but now the authorities have come up with a new set of requirements”. 
 
 Responding to this, an MTC official at the headquarters said that instructions were given to collect Aadhaar details as data on ration cards was illegible in many instances.
 
  The official, however, said that he was not aware of instructions to collect the old ID cards. This is not the first time senior citizens are facing an issue in renewing their free passes. Last year, those from suburbs were denied applications stating that they were not residing within the city limits.
