AHMEDABAD: The state government has further extended the deadline for fitting   (HSRPs) on vehicles till July 31 this year. The last date earlier was April 30.

 According to a notification issued by the state government, several old vehicles still have not got HSRPs installed. 
 
 To help such vehicle owners, the government decided to extend the last date for installing HSRPs by another three months.
 
 The official said the government on November 16, 2012, decided to have HSRPs on new vehicles sold. According to officials, around 30% of new vehicles were still not fitted with HSRP number plates. Officials said that even as the RTO has made it compulsory, several vehicle owners did not go to the RTO to get their HSRPs fixed.
 
 Officials said there were more than 50 lakh vehicles in the state, which needed to be fitted with HSRPs. Officials said that the exact number of vehicles cannot be estimated as no one comes back to renew registrations of the vehicles when they expire.
 
 Officials said Ahmedabad city has around 45 lakh vehicles. Of these, around 60% were registered after 2012. Only two lakh of the remaining vehicles have got HSRPs fitted.
