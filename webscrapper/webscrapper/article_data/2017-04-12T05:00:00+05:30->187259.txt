Barely a month after foraying into Bollywood playing Alia Bhatt’s bestie in  ,   has begun shooting for her maiden Telugu film. She is playing Sumanth’s lady love in the upcoming romantic drama directed by Gautham. “When I heard the script I was completely bowled over. It’s a love story that will play out in three different time farames,” says the actress, who joined the sets of the film last week.
How can the same love story play out in three different time-frames? “You will have to watch the film to find out,” says Aakanksha who sounds quite kicked about her role. “I play an urban Telugu girl who is very strong willed and independent yet has a vulnerability about her. She’s very real and has many layers to her personality. I have a significant role to play in the scheme of things,” shares the Jaipur born actress who shot into limelight with the TV show,  .
 Talking about the film, Aakanksha adds,“The romance in the film is of the slice-of-life variety. There is no melodrama attached and I’m sure the audience will be able to identify with it.”
