 and   are all set to team up again three years after 'Kick'. This time it’s for Remo D’souza’s untitled next in which Salman plays a widower with a nine-year-old daughter and Jackie is his dance teacher.

  
  
  Remo, who has worked earlier with the actress in the Tiger Shroff-starrer 'A Flying Jatt', told Mirror, “She is one of the best dancers we have and perfect for the role. We have already seen this jodi on screen and they look nice together.”
 
 And when does his film kick off? “Salman is currently in Morocco and will return to Mumbai in two weeks time. We’ll figure the dates then.” Meanwhile, his leading lady who started learning pole-dancing for Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK’s upcoming film, 'A  ', under instructor  , has taken it up as a hobby now.
 
  
  
 “Since the film is set in Miami, we thought it would be a fun way to integrate the city into the film by having me pole dancing to a song,” informs Jackie, admitting that it isn’t an easy dance form and takes time getting used to.
 
 “Pole-dancing is actually a sport recognised at the Olympics. You need strength to carry yourself on the pole and perform. The toughest part is that it’s really painful as it pulls the skin a lot and it takes time to get used to the sensation.”
 
 Besides 'A Gentleman', she has two other films lining up for release, including the David Dhawan-directed 'Judwaa 2' also featuring Varun Dhawan and   and 'Drive' opposite   Rajput.
 
  “Working with the Dhawans is always a pleasure because they are amazing people and this time we’re recreating a cult movie. In Drive my character is a lot of fun and its director Tarun Mansukhani is a genius,” she exults, describing her co-star   as a gentleman for real.
