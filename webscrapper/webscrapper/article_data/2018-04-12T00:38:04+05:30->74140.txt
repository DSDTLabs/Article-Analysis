NEW DELHI: The   has floated the tender for setting up a   plant, along with an engineered landfill site, at  .   said the   was proposed to generate 15MW of energy daily.

 Once functional, it will be the city’s fourth WTE plant — after Ghazipur, Okhla and Narela-Bawana. While the plant at   has the capacity to process 1,200 MT of garbage to produce 12MW of energy, the one at Okhla can process 1,200 MT of waste to generate 9MW. The WTE plant at Narela-Bawana has the capacity to process 2,000 MT of waste to produce 24MW. 
 
 Officials said the plant would be set up over an area of 12 acres near the existing Bhalswa landfill site. An engineered landfill site will also be developed there. “The idea of having an engineered landfill site is to ensure that the garbage is processed daily and only the residual from the WTE plant is dumped at the landfill. This can help avoid piling up of waste,” a corporation official said. 
 
 The 40-acre landfill site, which was commissioned in 1994, reached its saturation point several years ago. However, with no alternative land available, waste continues to be dumped there. While several recommendations were made for the reclamation of the landfill site, nothing happened on the ground. Due to excessive release of methane from the waste, fires are quite common at the site.
 
 After a “landslide” at the Ghazipur landfill last year claimed two lives, there has been renewed urgency on the part of the corporations to find alternative dumping grounds. Recently,   was allotted a 12-acre plot near the existing landfill site in Bhalswa. “Once, the new site becomes operational, we will shut the existing one and create a green cover,” the official said. 
 
 The civic body has also floated the tender for outsourcing collection and disposal of garbage in four of its zones — city, Karol Bagh, Keshavpuram and Narela.
