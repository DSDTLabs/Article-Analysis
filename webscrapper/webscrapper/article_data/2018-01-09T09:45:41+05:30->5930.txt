CHENNAI: Police have detained a 52-year-old temporary   bus driver who fatally knocked down a motorist near Santhome on Sunday night.

 Balakrishnan, 52, of Kannagi Nagar was identified with the help of CCTV footage from an ATM in Santhome. On Sunday night,  , driving bus number 102 from   to Kannagi Nagar, rammed a biker moving ahead of him at Santhome. The biker was later identified as R  , 18, from Dummil Kuppam.
 
 Balakrishnan drove away from the scene even though the biker was lying in a pool of blood. A group of locals gathered and protested near the spot condemning the rash and negligent driving. Police pacified the crowd and assured them that action would be initiated. Since three MTC buses had crossed the Santhome stretch at that time, police analysed CCTV footage and found that Balakrishnan was involved in the accident.
 
 Police said Balakrishnan was employed with a private travel agency in Kannagi Nagar. He had submitted his licence to MTC officials when they called for temporary drivers to operate buses during the strike. Police have detained him for questioning.
