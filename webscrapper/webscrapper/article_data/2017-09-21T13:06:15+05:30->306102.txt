PALANPUR:  , five km from  ,   

 Rampaging mobs from both communities took the roads and began heavy stone pelting at each other. Some of them even torched vehicles and a roadside kiosk.
 
 “A young boy was having tea at roadside stall when another youngster on a bike came there. His bike just brushed him a little and there was a heated altercation between the two. This snowballed into rioting,” said Mehsana superintendent of police, Chaitanya Mandlik. 
 
 Apart from torching vehicles and small kiosks, the mobs began burning tyres of the road. Police reached the spot and dispersed the rioters. 
 
 The injured students from different communities were rushed to   for treatment, said RS PAtel, police inspector, Mehsana local crime branch. 
 
 Mandlik said that at least 20 people from both communities were taken into preventive detention. Cross complaints have been lodged in the B-division police station. 
 
 Police have beefed up deployment and patrolling in Nagalpur, where an uneasy calm prevailed after the violence. Most of the shops and business establishments downed their shutters early fearing escalation of tension.
