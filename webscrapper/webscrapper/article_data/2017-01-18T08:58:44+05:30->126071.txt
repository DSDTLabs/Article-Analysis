UDAIPUR: Supporters raised slogans of ‘Jai-Sardar, Jai-Patidar’ as  , convener of the   (PAAS), made his exit from Udaipur city on Tuesday morning. 

 Hardik had come here for six months stay, a period that was stipulated by the Gujarat High Court to be spend by him outside the state. 
 
 Thousands of men from the Dangi-Patel community from all parts of Rajasthan as well as Gujarat had gathered here to hail and accompany their leader on the his return journey. Around 8.30 am,   went to the Pratapnagar police station where he had been marking his weekly attendance for past six months. He completed the formalities of the last attendance and left with a cavalcade of men who cheered all the way. 
 
 Before departure, Hardik expressed gratefulness to the community men for extending him all courtesies during his stay in Udaipur. “ I am overwhelmed by the love and warmth I received from Mewar but the police and administration tried everything to make my journey difficult. I am committed to continue my struggle for the quota demand. We will have a mixed strategy of Gandhian as well as BhagatSingh’s way to protest,” Hardik said to the media. 
 
 “Agar koi hamare ek gaal pe thappad mare toh hum dusra gaal aagey kar denge, lekin apne adhikaro ke liye shaheed hone se bhi peeche nai hatenge,” Hardik said.
 
 Over 500 people in 130 vehicles had been the part of the cavalcade and community men had put up gates at major junctions throughout the route to welcome him. At a toll plaza near Kherwada, there was a minor tiff between the supporters and toll employees, however, one of Hardik’s men cleared the confusion by making payment for all their vehicles. 
 
 “Taking lessons from the past incident, we were extra cautious and did not want to create any misunderstanding regarding toll fees and hence we paid for every vehicle,” Gehrilal Dangi, district president of Patel Navnirman Sena told TOI. Hardik also addressed a mass gathering at Himmatnagar in Gujarat later afternoon.
