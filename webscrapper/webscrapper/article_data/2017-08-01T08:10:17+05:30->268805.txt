 Chief secretary  , on April 6, had asked the forest department to furnish documents related to the soil purchase and the procedures followed.

 He had said the firm which supplied soil claimed that it was sourced from five different places. He, however, had said that further documents had been sought from the forest department.
 
 Also, the department was asked to inquire from where the soil had been brought. Singh could not be contacted for his comment.
