AHMEDABAD: Sense International India will mark its twenty years of services in India through its art projects, Art Makes Sense and SensX, designed to raise awareness about the little-known disability – deafblindness — a condition which combines vision and hearing loss.

  Art Makes Sense is India’s first collaborative art show that has brought together 63 of India’s celebrated artists to create tactile artworks in their signature style using textures and art installations that can be felt through touch. The paintings have no glass and encourage people with or without visual impairment to enjoy works by some of India’s master artists. 
 
 The project will be curated by  , curator & MD, Marvel Art Gallery. Art Makes Sense will be open to all for viewing at Hyatt, Vastrapur, on February 21 from 10:30am to 9:00pm. 
 
 Additionally, around 20 deafblind children and adults and their interpreters in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru will be working with artists to create unique art pieces at a two-day workshop, which can be appreciated using the senses such as touch.
 
 “It is when you become and feel like one of them will the sensitivity grow. Our purpose will be achieved in the process with the mass dissemination of knowledge and awareness generation of this unique disability,” said  , director, Sense India.
 
 Sense India is accredited by the United Nations with global partners spread across the UK, Bangladesh, Kenya, Peru, Romania and Uganda whose directors were present to lend their support to the projects.
