KOLHAPUR: Launched as a part of the ‘Novel Schemes’ last year, the health camps organised by the   (ZP) is a hit among senior citizens across rural parts of the district. 

 ZP has organised the camps in parts of the district where people do not have an access to proper health infrastructure and doctors. ZP has sanctioned Rs 3 lakh to organise these health camps and have provided medical aid to over 2,800 senior citizens. 
 
 The district rural administration has decided to continue the scheme as ‘Aadharwad’ this time, which means caring for someone. 
 
 District health officer,   said, “Elderly people from the rural parts of the district do not have a proper access to healthcare. We have launched this scheme to cater people across 12 talukas in the district. So far, we have conducted over 12 camps and have sent our expert doctors in orthopaedics, medicine, ophthalmology and gynaecologists to test these patients and provide them treatment free of cost.”
 
 He added, “During my visit to the camps, we found that most of the senior citizens are suffering from high blood pressure problem, water-borne diseases, heart ailments and tuberculosis.”
 
 While our trips to these rural areas, we found that over 84 patients were critical and we shifted them to the   (CPR) civil hospital for further treatment.
 
 Around 433 senior citizens with blood pressure complaints, 303 with diabetes, 352 cataract, 701 arthritis, 7 paralytic, 23 with heart ailments and 18 tuberculosis patients were treated through the camps.
