PATNA: The noble initiative of Patna DM   Agarwal to persuade people to   bore fruits on Monday with at least 205 district officials pledging in writing to   

 Agarwal, who pledged to donate his eyes in December last year, had been relentlessly pleading with his officials to follow the suit. On Monday, the DM along with consenting officials filled the pledge form and signed it.
 
 "Not only the officials, even their spouses signed the form," a beaming DM told TOI, recalling many of these officials had initially made a lukewarm response to his move.
 
 Eye donation is almost an alien concept in  . According to figures furnished by the   (IGIMS), one of two hospitals in the district where eye transplant surgery is performed, hardly 100 such surgeries have happened during the last two years since doctors at this government facility begand transplanting eyes. 
 
 As of now, 150-odd needy patients are in registered with the IGIMS, waiting for cornea transplant. According to a rough estimate, no less than 10,000 people in Bihar are in need of donated eyes. 
 
 "With eye donation not in vogue in our state, many move to places like Chennai for the transplant," the DM rued.
 
 Buoyed by the overwhelming response of his officials, Agarwal now wants to rope in senior citizens in the noble exercise. "The administration will organise a special eye donation camp for senior citizens on May 20," he said and added the administration would put up hoardings in different localities, profiling the donors as a mark of salutation to their gesture. 
 
 The pledging individuals will be given an eye card with the contact details of the hospital and administration. "A team of doctors will visit the house of the donor with a refrigerated box and collect the corneas. All that the relatives have to do is to give us a call after the death of the pledging donor," Agarwal said and added the donation should be made preferably within eight hours of death.
