BENGALURU: The high court on Thursday ordered notice to Commercial Street police, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the   (NIA) in a petition filed by Asim Sharif, a leader of   (PFI), challenging the case against him in relation to the murder of RSS worker Rudresh. 

 Justice John Michael Cunha posted the matter to February 14 for hearing. Appearing for Asim, advocate MS   argued the central government has gone beyond the law while referring the matter to the NIA suo motu without the presence of cogent material. He said in the absence of a request from Karnataka, the Centre lacked material and jurisdiction to refer the matter to NIA suo motu by detaching it from Commercial Street police. 
 
 The petitioner claimed all the accused along with him are falsely implicated in the case and alleged a statement was extracted from the co-accused after subjecting them to third-degree treatment. 
 
 He contended assigning the case of a local murder to NIA is nothing but arbitrary use of executive power under political pressure, which is against the mandate of Article 20 of Constitution and grossly changes the perspective of entire case. Apart from the case registered by Commercial Street police, the petitioner has challenged the second FIR registered by NIA on the same set of facts. 
 
 Rudresh was hacked to death on October 16, 2016 on   in  . On October 27, four persons were arrested. Based on their statement, the petitioner was arrayed as accused number 5 and arrested on November 2. On December 7, MHA passed an order under Section 6(5) of the NIA Act and directed the agency to register a case.
