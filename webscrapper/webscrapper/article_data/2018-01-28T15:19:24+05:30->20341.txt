 "Yes, it is true that I am portraying the role of Suhasini in 'Mere Sai'. I feel blessed and honoured to be part of this immensely popular show amongst Sai followers. I would like to share something personal. My grandmother, who is no more, was fortunate to receive Baba's blessings in person. She was a baby during that period of 1913 to 1918," Supriya said in a statement. 
 
 "When I see 'Mere Sai' and see young children in the show being blessed by Baba, I feel overwhelmed thinking that in the history of time my grandmother too was one the few lucky ones. Her devotion to Sai grew with her age. And I feel all these blessings have kept her family actually following what all saints preach."
 
 The actress added that she is a student of "Sai Baba's pristine teachings of upholding faith and patience.' All of us just need to open our hearts to receive blessings".
