BHOPAL: It seems the state government remembers about recruitment drives only when the assembly polls are round the corner. If we take a glance at the BJP government’s track record in the last 14 years, we clearly find that most of the recruitment drives took place in the election year or a year before the polls.

 Even this time with state polls duein November this year, the government is all set to recruit 36,000 teachers. It has already held 14 recruitment testsfor 34,391 government posts in 2017 in different government departments.
 
 
 Strangely enough, the government does not have authenticfiguresof number of jobless and it is now planning to launch a survey to assess the number. After every academic session in universities and engineering colleges, the number of jobless peoplehas been going up. From 2015 to 2017, the rate of unemployment has gone up by 53%, according totheeconomic survey carriedoutlast year.
 
 After defeating Congress in November 2003, theBJPformed its government in Madhya Pradesh and did notdo any recruitment till 2007. There were only two recruitment exams in 2007, according to the website of MP   . But in the election year 2008, nine recruitment exams were conducted by the Professional Examination Board or   in which 2.35 lakh candidates appeared. The data gathered from the government’s website also suggests that only five recruitment exams were held in 2009, five in 2010 and six in 2011. But come 2013, the poll year, the number rose to 18 exams in 2012 and 16 in 2013. In the two years, recruitment for the posts of accountants, lab technicians, pharmacists, forest guards, clerks, jail guards, staff nurses and others were held.
 
 Last year, the professional exam board held 14 exams for 34391 government posts. Government sources said that out of the36000teachers’ posts, processfor recruitment of 11,000senior teachers islikely tostart after this month. This would be followed by recruitment of 25,000 more teachers later this year, preferably before the assembly elections.
 
 AkshayHunka, convener of recently formed   said, “The government has even politicised the issue of unemployment, thebiggest problem faced by educated youth. Even the recruitment exam for patwaris was held in December last year in which lakhs of educatedunemployed appeared”.
 
 When TOI tried to contact minister for employment and industries  , he was not available for his comments. Denying that theissueof patwaris recruitment is related with elections, revenue minister   said the recruitment exam is held whenever vacancy arises in government departments.
