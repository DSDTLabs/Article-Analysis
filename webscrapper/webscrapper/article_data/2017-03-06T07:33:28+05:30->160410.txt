AMARAVATI: The new assembly and secretariat blocks at   in Guntur district are virtually under a security blanket. With the budget session beginning on Monday, additional forces and different units of the police department have been deployed for the smooth conduct of the first-ever legislative session in bifurcated AP. 

 An elaborate surveillance system has been put in place on all the routes that connect to the state's new power centre, Velagapudi. The police department has set up a multi-layer security channel at all entry and exit points to the assembly blocks. Police personnel from law and order units,   (APSP) and armed reserve (AR) are positioned at all vantage points, starting from the national highway between Guntur and Vijayawada. Also, intelligence and special branch police, in plainclothes, are keeping an eye on people with criminal records.
 
 The police department is taking additional care as the district-level officers do not have much experience in protecting so many VIPs for such a long period. Although senior officers in the district had been on duty during the VVIP visits, these programmes were generally confined to a single location. The entire assembly premises would be under the direct control of the speaker and the police cannot enter the place without the speaker's permission.
 
  "Our people have to adjust a little. We have cautioned them to exercise a restraint as we can't rush into the premises without permission from the speaker's office," said a senior police official.
