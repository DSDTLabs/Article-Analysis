Looks like   is so excited to pair up with   in her upcoming film, ‘Thaana Serntha Koottam’. She says, “I have been ardent fan of Suriya from my school days. My mother has acted with his father   in three movies. I used to challenge her saying that I would act with his son one day. I am so happy that it turned out to be a reality.”

 Keerthy adds that Suriya has always been her pillar of suggestion. “Suriya sir is such a reserved person and doesn’t talk much. But whenever I ask for any suggestions, he comes up with a supportive gesture.”
 
 On delineating her characterization in the film,   says, “I don’t have a name in Thaana Serntha Koottam. My character involves humour and surprise elements as well. I play the role of an orthodox girl. I loved the way   narrated the script and my characterization.”
