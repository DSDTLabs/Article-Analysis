 is a regular at Delhi ramps now, and one would think he's choosy about his outfits, but the actor says that he strictly believes that fashion is not just about wearing good clothes, but is also about a fit body. "I personally believe that a good fashion sense is all about having a great body. If you are fit and have a great structure, you can look good in anything you wear. And that holds true for both men and women. I am very strict about my workout. I keep reinventing, like I keep switching from pilates to yoga to running to stay fit," said Vidyut, who recently walked the ramp for designers Bharat and Reshma at DT  . 

  He added, "It is great to be back in Delhi, I love the fashion sense of people here. I have hardly managed to take time out for myself when in Delhi, but this time I am doing a road trip from Delhi to Shimla and further. I am very happy with the way my last movie shaped up, so I am celebrating that success with this trip."
