  The micro nutrient-rich food has been served as a pilot project in Dhenkanal district in association with the   (WFP). "With 80% schoolchildren suffering from anaemia, the micro nutrient-enriched food is expected to improve their health," official sources said. 
 
 "We have started serving the powder from this month to around 1.5 lakh students in classes I to VIII in eight blocks.
 
  The powder contains seven micro nutrients, including iron, folic acid, Vitamin B12, A, D, thiamine and zinc. The powder is being added to curries or dalma and served," said state nodal officer, Mid-Day Meal programme, Gangadhar Sahoo. 
 
 Before serving the powder, a base-line survey among children wsas conducted by the   (IIPH) which recorded various parameters like haemoglobin endurance and anthropometric details. "Besides the micro nutrient powder, fortified rice kernels will also be added in the meal to enhance nutrition," Sahoo added. 
 
 A similar project was launched for pre-school children in Telengana district, which resulted in reducing anaemia levels from 46% to 10% and iron deficiency from 40% to 8%.
 
  "Depending on the success of the project in Dhenkanal, the programme will be replicated in other parts of the state," said Sahoo. The state government had signed a MoU with the WFP in September 2015 for the micro nutrient programme. "For every project there is an incubation period of two years during which the baseline survey is conducted," he pointed out.
