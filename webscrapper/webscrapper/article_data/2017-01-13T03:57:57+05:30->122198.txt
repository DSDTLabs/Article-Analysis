NEW DELHI: A group of   in Sonipat district in   have written to the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to intervene with the  , which has been offered huge tracts of land by the Haryana government for setting up of a $10 billion industrial township in Kharkhoda.

 In a letter addressed to Li Keqiang, Bhoomi Bachao Sangharsh Samiti of Kundal, which has been protesting against the acquisition of nearly 3,000 acres for the past five years, said that farmers have not given possession of land to the Haryana government and they won’t do so “till their last breath”. The association that claims the support of over 10,000 families of farmers in the region has demanded higher compensation under the new land acquisition law and other benefits such as allotment of developed plots.
 
 They have also said that affected farmers have already challenged the land acquisition process for nearly 2,800 acres and the matter is still pending in the Supreme Court. The Saimiti has also claimed that the state government has not shared the details of locals’ protest with the Chinese investor.
 
 In January 2015, Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) had signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda to develop Wanda Industrial New City in Kharkhoda. The huge tracts of fertile farmland was originally acquired during Bhupinder Singh Hooda government to set up an industrial model township, which never took off due to farmers protest.
 
 “We the farmers and working class of India request the Chinese authorities to take necessary action in this regard and deter this deal as this sets a wrong precedence and thus results in poor image of a communist country working for the survival and benefits of the common man,” the Samiti has submitted to the Chinese government. Samiti president Hasraj Rana said they had no other option left than approaching China.
