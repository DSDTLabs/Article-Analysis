KOHIMA: Two persons were killed and 10 injured in police firing in Dimapur and Longleng districts after protesters opposing 33% reservation of seats for women in   (ULBs) turned violent. 

 Despite the violence, elections to 10 town councils were held on Wednesday. In two other town councils, Tening and Longkhim, no one turned up to vote.
 
 Official sources said the voting percentage in the 10 town councils was quite high. However, the exact figure could not be determined due to weak telecommunications network. 
 
 On Tuesday night, police fired on a mob protesting against the civic polls near the private residence of chief minister   in Dimapur. Two youths - Thejavizo Metha and Bendangnungsang Nopku - died as a result. Three others were hurt.
 
 In another incident in Longleng district on Wednesday, police resorted to firing to prevent a mob from damaging the ballot boxes and burning down polling stations. Seven people were injured in the clash. The state government suspended polling in the Longleng town council after the violence but tension remained high there. The administration also issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC.
 
 On Wednesday, there was a bandh in Kohima, Dimapur and other areas. In Kohima, bandh supporters burnt down two vehicles, while another vehicle was gutted in Dimapur.
 
 Thousands of people attended a service for the two persons killed in Dimapur. The Joint Coordination Committee comprising Naga tribal organizations demanded that the Zeliang government should be disbanded immediately. It also demanded the suspension of police personnel involved in the firing.
 
 In view of the prevailing situation, all mobile data services have been blocked in the state since midnight. Some tribal bodies which were opposed to the holding of elections called for a bandh in the districts.
