RANCHI: Three counters were opened for residents to pay their holding tax by   (RMC) at its office's premises on Thursday. 

  C P Singh had directed the corporation not to outsource holding tax collection to any agency. RMC started collecting the holding tax after Sparrow Softech Pvt Limited, an agency which was roped for the task, stopped collection two months ago. 
 
 Municipal commissioner Shantanu Agrahari said unless the state government makes an alternative arrangement, they have decided to collect the tax in order to avoid confusion among the residents. "Due to the public's demands, we have started collecting holding tax through our counters. They can also make an online payment through our portal if they face any problem," Agrahari said. 
 
 He added that RMC will continue to collect the holding tax until the state government makes a final decision. 
 
 An RMC official said, many residents are not aware about the decision, as they have to fill the self-assessment forms and mention the total area of the residence before paying holding tax. "Annual rental value and total carpet area needs to be calculated thoroughly before filling self assessment forms, which might be one of the reasons why the corporation is receiving a good response," he said.
 
 The official added, "We do not have enough man power to assign everybody tasks to collect holding tax, its good they are visiting the counters for submission."
 
 Other counters, where residents could pay the holding taxes, included three counters at Doranda and 13 branches of ICICI banks across the city. These, however, wore a deserted look as only a few residents were spotted on the first day of the submission.
 
 Meanwhile, tax payer Raja Sinha, a resident of Morhabadi said, he went to RMC's office, "But after waiting for one hour, there was no one seen at the counter. Then a fourth grade employee informed me to pay my holding tax at ICICI bank instead."
