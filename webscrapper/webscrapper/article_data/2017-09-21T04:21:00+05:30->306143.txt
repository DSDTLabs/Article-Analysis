Gandhinagar: In the 2012 assembly elections, Gujarat Congress lost the monitoriy-dominated Jamalpur seat due infighting among its Muslim leaders. Senior Congress leaders Badruddin Sheikh and Vazirkhan Pathan have written to the Gujarat Congress president asking him not to give ticket to Sabir Kabliwala who, in 2012, had fought against the party and helped the BJP.

 Kabliwala, former Congress MLA, had joined the BJP but later returned to the Congress and is considered a strong candidate for the Jamalpur seat. Around 13 Muslim leaders have demanded ticket for Jamalpur seat and are accusing each other of helping the BJP. tnn
