AHMEDABAD: The   (KAPS), which has an installed capacity of 440 mega watts (MW), will not produce a single unit of power for at least another year. 

 While one of the two units was already shut down on July 1, 2015, power generation at the second unit was also stopped on March 11 last year power following leakage in the coolant system used for cooling the  . Both units have a capacity of 220 MW each and are based on   (PHWR) technology.
 
 Sources at KAPS said that both the units will be non-operational for at least one year as fuel from the reactor core of the units has been unloaded for replacement of coolant channels.
 
 In fact, a detailed investigation by the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) has found corrosion in the walls of the coolant channels, which could have happened any time in 2012.
 
 An update of investigation into leak in coolant system in unit-1 of KAPS released by AERB on Wednesday has confirmed presence of several cracks in the coolant channel's walls. A close examination also found "existence of localised corrosion spots" on the outer surface of the channel, which were similar to the corrosion spots seen on the outer surface of the channels removed from unit-2 of KAPS that was shut down in July 2015 after minor leak in the channel.
