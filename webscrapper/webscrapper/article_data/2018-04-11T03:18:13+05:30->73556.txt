MUMBAI: Authorities at the Byculla women’s prison are likely to record Indrani Mukerjea’s statement on Wednesday. The prime accused in the   murder case is under treatment at   after an overdose of anti-depressants last week. 

 The police hope Indrani’s statement clears the air on what exactly happened that required her hospitalization. Her chemical analysis report on Monday had confirmed that she overdosed on medicines. Meanwhile, a special CBI court on Tuesday allowed Indrani’s lawyer Gunjan Mangla’s plea to meet her at JJ Hospital. The court said three lawyers, including Mangla, Sudeep Pasbola and  , were permitted to meet her in the presence of two hospital attendants. The court said the advocates are expected to remain at the hospital for reasonable time. Mangla said she was likely to meet Indrani on Wednesday morning. 
 
 A senior jail official on Tuesday visited the hospital and found Indrani conscious and recovering. “She is fine and spoke to us,” the officer said. On Friday night, Indrani woke up complaining of restlessness and was taken to JJ. 
 
 An inquiry into how she fell ill has been ordered.  , inspector- general of police (prisons), who is heading the inquiry, said statements of around half a dozen people, including the jail nurse and a woman constable who gives Indrani her medicines in her cell, have been recorded. There were two more inmates in Indrani’s cell at the time of the incident. Their statements too have been recorded. 
 
 “After the death of an inmate,  , in the prison, which led to a riot, Indrani was shifted from the general barracks to another cell, where she has two fellow inmates. She would take anti-depressant medicines, prescribed by the jail doctor,” said an official. Jail officials expect JJ’s reply on the request for Indrani’s statement by Wednesday morning.
