Bathinda: Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore stressed on the need for farmers to use only recommended seeds and pesticides on cotton crop to avoid pest attacks on the crop. He also asked the scientists from the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to make farmers aware about the methods to avoid pest attack and have regular interactions with the farming community. He also urged them to do research to make crops pest resistant.

 Badnore was speaking at the   organized by PAU at its regional research station (RRS) in Bathinda on Tuesday. He also advised the farmers to reduce expenditure, use water and fertilizers judiciously and adopt subsidiary occupations to make farming a profitable venture.
 
 PAU vice-chancellor (VC) Baldev Singh Dhillon, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University VC Professor Mohan Pal Singh Ishar and secretary to Punjab governor J M Balamurugan were present on the occasion.
 
 Badnore said prime objective of such fairs was two-way interaction between the experts and farmers. He hailed the Punjab farmers for toiling hard for country’s food security. Equating the farmer fairs to knowledge-encapsulated events, he advocated a two-pronged strategy for ensuring a lucrative agricultural enterprise, judicious expenditure and adoption of subsidiary ventures. He also advocated use of PAU-developed ‘Happy Seeder’ machine to control stubble burning.
 
 VC Dhillon said to stay in consonance with the central government’s theme of doubling the farm income in near future, the farming community must look towards mushroom cultivation, beekeeping, dairy and horticulture.
