PATNA: The National Investigation Agency ( ) on Tuesday took over the probe into the low intensity blast near the world-famous Mahabodhi Temple and recovery of two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from places close to the Tibetan monastery in Bodh Gaya from state police.

 The state police have already handed over all documents and evidences related to the case to the NIA. Sources said the NIA submitted these documents before a special NIA court here on Tuesday. It is suspected that the terror plot was hatched outside India.
 
 An NIA source said the agency would soon move the special NIA court seeking production warrant of three suspected terrorists – Mohammad Paigambar Sheikh (24), Jamirul Sheikh (34) and Shish Mohammad (23). The trio, who were arrested by Special Task Force (STF) of West Bengal police recently, allegedly owe allegiance to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), a Pakistan-funded terrorist outfit based in Bangladesh. 
 
 On January 19, three IEDs were planted by suspected JMB terrorists in Bodh Gaya to target Buddhist monks, who had reached the holy city from across the world. It is believed that the JMB had planned the attack to seek revenge of genocide of Rohingyas in Buddhist-dominated Myanmar.
 
 One of the IEDs planted below a generator set near Kalchakra ground exploded, while two more IEDs were recovered – one from near the gate number four of Mahabodhi Temple and another near the Tibetan monastery where Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama was staying.
 
 An NIA team headed by a SP-rank officer is camping in Bodh Gaya to probe the blast. A senior NIA official said the agency was trying to ascertain where the conspiracy to carry out the terror attack in Bodh Gaya was hatched. “It seems that the terror plot was hatched either in Bangladesh or Myanmar as Aqa Mul Mujahideen, a Rohigya militant group, has close links with JMB,” the official added.
