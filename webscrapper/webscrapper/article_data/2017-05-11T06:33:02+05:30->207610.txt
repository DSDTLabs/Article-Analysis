NEW DELHI:   will continue to raise concerns over the reliability of EVMs.   MLAs and party workers will   a demonstration, as part of their “Save Democracy Campaign, outside the   on Thursday. 

 Party MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj had on Tuesday conducted a live demonstration on a “prototype EVM” in the Delhi assembly, showing how it could be tampered with to favour a particular candidate. 
 
 Addressing a press conference, labour minister and AAP’s Delhi convener Gopal Rai said AAP would participate in the all-party meeting called by ECI on May 12. He also sought that the poll panel must declare the date of the “hackathon”.
 
 “We have been hearing about it in the media but no final dates have been shared with us. We would like to request ECI to finalise the dates and we will participate in the hackathon. We want to tell ECI, ‘Give us your EVM and we will put our motherboard and show you how it can be hacked’,” Rai added. “If we find that the ECI is open to suggestion and is positive, we will support it, but if we find that ECI is rigid and not prepared to listen on the EVM tampering issue, then we will see how our ‘Loktantra Bachao Abhiyan’ will progress.” 
 
 He asserted that the awareness campaign was necessary because whether an EVM can be tampered with or not is not the only concern. According to Rai, the real question is that there is a need to protect the electoral process that forms the foundation of democracy.
 
 “When complaints of alleged EVM tampering started pouring in after the polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab, political parties raised concerns with ECI. However, the commission gave an impression that these complaints were just imaginary doubts and EVMs are tamper-proof. But on Tuesday, Bhardwaj proved it on the floor of the assembly that an EVM can be hacked,” Rai said.
