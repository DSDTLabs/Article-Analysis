Udupi:   president   said, “Just by believing that there is a wave, a party cannot win every time. It is important to strengthen the party at the booth level. Workers are the real reason for a party winning elections, and to strengthen the party at the booth level, Shakthi Kendras are formed. The Karnataka elections are important for the BJP, as people here are not happy with the corrupt   government. Anger against the state government should be converted into votes for the BJP, so that the party forms a majority government in the state.” 

 He was addressing the   here on Wednesday morning. He appealed to party workers to not take the election lightly. He said, “ Our job is to strengthen the party for another 50 years, by winning from the panchayat to Parliament. For this, the booth level is important. The BJP’s biggest leaders are   heads, and they have to work in the grass-roots level”. 
 
 ‘Workers not taking elections seriously’
 
  I feel party workers in Karnataka are not taking the election seriously. I felt there was a good response from the public towards the BJP, however when a leader does not work with interest and workers are lazy, the condition of the party will be pathetic. 
 
 Youth must stay away from controversies
 
 “Why should BJP party workers involve themselves with political issues? Youth should concentrate on the welfare of the state, and work for the betterment of the nation, and stay away from controversies. What others do is not our problem, our interest should be to unite the party.
