MYSURU: Unhappy with the recruitment of as many as 456 teachers to the Girijana schools through the Karnataka Public Service Commission ( ), members of the   Teachers’ Association and Teachers’ Welfare Association staged a   here on Thursday near the deputy commissioner’s office.

 The protesters feared that the state government was attempting to sideline   through such a move. “Contractual teachers are being sidelined. There are 14,034 students spread across 118 Girijana Ashrama schools in 16 districts of Karnataka. More than 390 teachers have been teaching at these schools for low salaries for many years, and appointing teachers through KPSC would be doing them a grave injustice,” the protesters said.
 
 In the 118 schools, as many as 563 teaching posts are lying vacant, while 170 are working on a contract basis.
 
 Demanding that the government withdraw the appointment of teachers through KSPC, the agitators said, “We want the government to show some consideration to our service, and give up appointment of teachers through KPSC.”
