Vadodara: The standing committee of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will take up for discussion a proposal to set up a trust under the civic body to look into heritage and related works in the city. The proposal was moved over two years back, but was put in the cold storage since then.

 The proposal for the trust moved in September 2015 had stated that the trust should be headed by a retired bureaucrat and should have experts as its members. It was suggested that the trust should work independently.
 
 The proposal was held by the standing committee and never taken up for discussion again. But the agenda for the meeting of the committee on Saturday has included the item again.
 
 Apart from setting up the trust, the proposal had also sought authorisation for expenses towards the heritage cell and appointments of personnel to it by outsourcing and other related decisions. It had also sought preparation of various publicity material using various mediums.
