Nagpur: At Rs4,070 per entry for wildlife safari, Umred-Karhandla, Bor and Pench seem to have become costlier than premium Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). This is likely to create tourism imbalance in region as many would prefer to visit only Tadoba. All the tiger reserves, sanctuaries and national parks in the state are set to open from Sunday. A review of entry fee by TOI found that Pench has revised its rates and has made Bor Tiger Reserve and Umred-Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary as high-end parks. At both places, tiger sightings are not regular like Tadoba. As per the new rates, online safari booking to Pench, Bor and Umred-Karhandla for six persons will cost Rs3,970 per trip, including Rs100 towards camera fee and Rs2,000 towards Gypsy.  Those entering offline will have to pay additional Rs100, taking the total Rs4,070. On weekends, tourists will have to pay more. In Pench and two popular gates — Gothangaon (Kuhi) and Karhandla (Umred) — entry for private vehicles is banned. Hence, these parks have become costlier than Tadoba. The parks will continue to remain costly even as Gypsy rate in Tadoba has been increased from Rs2,000 to Rs2,200. “In Tadoba, where tourism routes are more than Bor and Umred-Karhandla and sightings are far better, one safari costs Rs3,700. It includes Rs2,200 towards Gypsy, Rs1,000 gate fee, Rs300 guide fee and Rs200 for high-end camera,” said regular visitor Himanshu Bagde. “Even as there is uniformity in re-opening the wildlife parks, there is huge disparity in safari rates. It is simply going beyond the reach of middle class tourists who wish to visit Karhandla,” said naturalist Amrut Naik. Naik added that tourism has dropped by 50% at Umred-Karhandla after its iconic tiger Jai went missing in April 2016. “As sightings are few and private vehicles are not allowed, there are not many visitors to the park. The tourism model here has completely collapsed,” he said. “When private vehicles were allowed till June 2016, the 12 guides at Gothangaon gate got at least 200 trips during summer season. In 2017 season, we got only 18 trips. Moreover, as there is drop in bookings, five Gypsies have already been sold by owners,” said a section of guides. Contrary to this, safari to Tipeshwar sanctuary near Pandharkawda and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) in Gondia and Bhandara districts comes to around Rs2,700, including gypsy. Per adult fee Tipeshwar is Rs100 while it is Rs50 in NNTR.
