NEW DELHI: The   on Friday refused to grant an urgent hearing to a petition seeking to restrain   from being sworn in as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu till the verdict against her in the disproportionate assets case is pronounced.

 Advocate GS Mani mentioned the petition before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar saying swearing in of Sasikala as CM would be unconstitutional.
 
 The CJI consulted Justices NV Ramana and DY Chandrachud on the bench before declining the request for urgent hearing.
 
 The Supreme Court had on February 6 asked the Karnataka government to wait for one week for the verdict on batch of pleas challenging the acquittal of the late Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa in a disproportionate assets case. The case also involved AIADMK leader VK Sasikala.
 
 Chennai-resident Senthil Kumar, who is general secretary of NGO Satta Panchayat Iyakkam, had then filed a PIL in the Supreme Court urging the top court to stop the swearing in of Sasikala till the SC verdict was pronounced.
 
 Kumar sought a stay on Sasikala's swearing-in contending that if she was convicted and forced to resign, there could be a "possibility of riots erupting all over Tamil Nadu".
 
 He said the law and order situation may worsen in such an eventuality as the state was already facing a "desperate situation" due to cyclone, demonetisation and death of Jayalalithaa.
