NEW DELHI: In an apparent case of   rage, a 28-year-old man was beaten up along with his friend in Dwarka   market on Thursday evening over parking of a car. One of the accused also attempted to shoot at the two men.

  (28), a resident of New Roshanpura in Najafgarh, told cops that he had gone to the market along with his friend Ravinder Dahiya to have dinner. The duo told cops that they had parked their Maruti Swift outside a restaurant.
 
 “A white Tata Safari SUV, bearing the registration number HR 13E 8693, was parked in front of our car. As we were heading out, the SUV owner came and shouted at us to remove our car from there,” Ashwini told cops, adding that the accused was joined by two men.
 
 Police said that the three men overpowered Ashwini and his friend, and started punching and kicking them.
 
 Suddenly, the SUV owner brought out his pistol and fired at the two. However, the bullet jammed and fell out of the barrel. A large crowd had gathered by then and the accused threatened the onlookers with his pistol before he fled in his car. Locals managed to nab the other two accused, Bharat Bhushan and Shashi Bhushan.
 
 Police said that a case under sections of the arms act, as well as sections 323 (causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 336 (endangering life and personal safety of others) of the IPC has been registered against them.
 
  footage of the area is being scanned. The arrested men are also being questioned for details of the SUV owner.
