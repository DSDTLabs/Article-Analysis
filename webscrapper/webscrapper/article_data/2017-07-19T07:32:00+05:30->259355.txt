Chandigarh: Known for his controversial remarks, BJP MP from Kurukshetra Raj Kumar Saini again invited the ire of Jat leaders over his remark in Jind about farmer leader Sir Chhotu Ram. Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala and senior Congress leader Ran Singh Maan have sought registration of a sedition case against Saini.

 “Saini has zero knowledge of Haryana’s history and the struggle of legendary leaders who fought for the rights of farmers and the poor. He should be booked and arrested for sedition,” said Chautala.
 
 Calling Saini as a BJP agent trying to divide the society, Maan added, “Even 24 hours after his statement went viral on social media, no BJP leader has condemned him. Since BJP leaders know that they have no face to show in public, they have made people like Saini to divert their attention and create a divide in the society.”
