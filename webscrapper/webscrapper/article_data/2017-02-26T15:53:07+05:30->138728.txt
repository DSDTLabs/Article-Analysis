Newlyweds   and   have begun another new journey together. The couple recently started a new foundation '   ' which, according to the website, is their effort to contribute to the society.

 On the webpage, Yash writes, "The greatest satisfaction one could ever get in life can only be found in the service of others. At our new office, help us make a difference... I have determined to contribute my bit to the society. It was this determination that has led to the birth of YashoMarga Foundation. This is an institution that is established to extend a helping hand. This institution will help the farmers and the labourers who work hard without caring the heat, rain and cold. This is not a task that is possible by me alone. Like it is said, 'little drops of rain, make a mighty ocean', it is fully possible to accomplish some good when the noble minds meet."
 
 Way to go, Yash and Radhika!
