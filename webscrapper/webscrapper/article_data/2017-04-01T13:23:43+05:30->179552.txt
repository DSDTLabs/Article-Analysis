NEW DELHI: AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi has a way with words. 

 Here he is today, about the BJP and it's   agenda: "BJP's hypocrisy is that in Uttar Pradesh cow is mummy but in the   it's yummy." 
 
 Owaisi was talking about recent stringent cow protection moves in the BJP-ruled states of   and Uttar Pradesh ( ) and the dilemma it may face in beef-eating, Christian  , where it recently cobbled together a majority in the Assembly elections.
 
 In UP, the new   government has come down heavily on illegal slaughterhouses, although critics say the chief minister's targets are meat-sellers in general and by extension the Muslim community.
 
 Gujarat yesterday passed a bill that could jail a person for 14 years for "cow slaughter." 
 
 "We have equalled killing of a cow or cow progeny with killing of a human being," a Gujarat minister said. 
 
 So what will the BJP do in Manipur, is a question Owaisi and other BJP critics are asking. 
 
 They are accusing the BJP of hypocrisy, especially after recent reported BJP comments that there "would be no  " in the Northeast. BJP leaders from Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram said to a Delhi newspaper that Uttar Pradesh-style beef politics would not come to the North East.
 
  All three Christian-majority states are bound for elections in 2018. In fact, the Naga People's Front is a BJP ally in the Manipur government.
