VIJAYAWADA: The permanent government complex (PGC) to come up in the capital of   will be the first of its kind in the country to have a unique   system (DCS). 

 The new system, followed in advanced countries, allows the distribution of   in the form of chilled water from a central source to multiple buildings spread over numerous locations through a network of underground pipes for optimal use of space and cooling. 
 
 According to current plans the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) will float a special purpose vehicle and seek the participation of private players.
 
  The DCS will be located on the outskirts of the government complex. Suitable land for it will be identified in the vicinity of river Krishna.
 
 In this system the cooling or heat rejection is usually provided from a central cooling plant and the power requirement of DCS is estimated at 350MW. As per plans, the power requirement of government complex, including the power required for DCS, would be met through a captive power plant of approximately 1,000 MW capacity.
 
 The estimated makeup water demand of 10 MGD will be met through fresh makeup water (8 MGD) and STP-treated water (2 MGD).   system would be designed for supply at 4.5° C at the building level and 13.5° C return temperature. Main plants would be underground. 
 
 Officials say that some time back the DCS system was introduced in   Tec (GIFT) city in Gujarat. However, the concept is still new to the country and Amaravati will be the first capital to have such a system on a big scale.
 
 The plan is to initiate a feasibility study for technical studies of DCS, identification of the site and provision of continuous water, hydrological studies in about three months and method
 
 A large proportion of   in the country is attributed to cooling. The DCS is 35-50% more energy efficient than conventional cooling systems. District cooling will produces 35-50% lower carbon emissions.
