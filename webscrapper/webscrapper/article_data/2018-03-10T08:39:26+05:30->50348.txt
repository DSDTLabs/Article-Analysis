LUCKNOW: The high-decibel campaign in Gorakhpur, led by chief minister  , has seen ministers and top leaders of all parties joining the grind, but mafiaturned-politician Harishankar Tewari is conspicuous by his absence. He has kept away from the campaign even though he has been approached by   Yadav.

 Tewari, who has considerable influence among Brahmins, is yet to canvass against BJP’s Brahmin candidate Upendra Shukla. Sources close to Tewari say he is under pressure from the Brahmin community for not favouring SP candidate Pravin Nishad, a backward.
 Tewari knows that Brahmins account for almost 10% voters in Gorakhpur, and can determine the fate of a candidate, hence he doesn’t want to antagonise them.
 
 Sources say Akhilesh had sent his trusted MLC Udaiveer Singh along with SP legislative party leader Ram Govind Chaudhary to Tewari, a five-time MLA from Gorakhpur’s Chillupar assembly seat, to request him to campaign for Nishad. Udaiveer confirmed that a SP delegation requested Tewari to support Nishad. “He may not be campaigning for us but his family is in our support,” he told TOI.
 
 Tewari’s son and BSP MLA Vinay Tewari has joined the SP-BSP campaign. Vinay says his father is a member of  , so there is no question of him joining the SP-BSP campaign. “Moreover, my father is not keeping well,” he says.
 
 Tewari is said to have differences with Yogi Adityanath and has been losing ground in Gorakhpur. He lost his traditional Chillupar seat to BSP’s Rajesh Tripathi, also a Brahmin, in 2007 and then again in 2012.
