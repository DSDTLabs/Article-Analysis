CHANDIGARH:  , who retired as army commander, Northern Command, has said as far as data security is concerned, it is time to move beyond   and the debate centred on privacy from the national security perspective.

 Hooda said since a lot of personal data is with  , Facebook and Amazon, which are not governed by Indian laws, more focus should be on the foreign entities to see how they sell, hold and disseminate the data of Indian citizens. “There is no legal control of our personal data with them and this can have huge national security implications,” said Hooda on the sidelines of the two-day workshop organised by   at PEC in collaboration with The Times of India on Monday.
 
 “We are only looking at Aadhaar and government agencies’ data, but a lot of personal data is held with MNCs like Facebook Amazon and Google. So, how are we going to control that data from a national security perspective? There is absolutely no legal control of our personal data with them. There should be some sort of legal provisions to make that data safe,” said Hooda.
 
 Hooda raised concerns over those holding this data, asking whether they have the sense of responsibility towards India’s national security? These are the areas, Hooda said, that need to be seriously looked into. Hooda said the analytics of these foreign entities is very advanced. “For example, Google is trying to aggregate all data from various subsidiaries and that has a huge national security implication,” he added.
