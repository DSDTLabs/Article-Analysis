CHENNAI: The city's first   could open in a few weeks. The   of the 8-km   stretch by   (CMRS) K A Manohar began on Wednesday and is expected to continue on Thursday. 

 When services begin, trains from Koyambedu to Shenoy Nagar will run in two tunnels, while only one tunnel will be used for those from Shenoy Nagar to Nehru Park. The second tunnel on this section will be opened along with Central metro station in end-2017.

 CMRL managing director Pankaj Kumar Bansal said "the line will be opened after making changes, if any, suggested by the CMRS and after the state and the central government fixes a date".
 
 As the trains are set to run below Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, metro rail has installed facilities to cut down on vibrations. He said, "We have a technology on tracks to prevent the vibration caused by trains from affecting the sensitive equipment used in these places". The underground line will also be flood-proof.
 
 Manohar said, "We will inspect access to service, tunnel ventilation, emergency measures and disaster management." These features are different from the elevated line. 
 
 On Wednesday, the CMRS checked tracks, overhead traction system, tunnel ventilation, air-conditioning, fire prevention, knowledge of staff, procedures for maintenance, ticketing and amenities. 
 
 On Thursday, trains will be operated from Nehru Park to Koyambedu (7.63km) to test braking, platform screen doors and other safety measures. The 4.54km upline between Koyambedu and Shenoy Nagar will also be checked.
