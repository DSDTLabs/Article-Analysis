MUMBAI:   was a disappointed man after his name did not feature in the tentative list of 351 players who will be part of the   auction pool. After all, anybody who has accumulated 890 runs in 10 matches at an impressive average of 59.3, and was instrumental in his team's progress to the Ranji Trophy semifinals earlier in the season, would be hoping his performances would be noted by those calling the shots. However, that was not the case with the experienced batsman from Jharkhand.

 The irony is that the 28-year-old is in terrific form in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali inter-zonal T20 tournament as well. Jaggi smashed 90 off 51 balls as East Zone made short work of   to record their second successive win in the tournament at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.
 
 Set a 179-run victory target, East Zone rode on Jaggi's brilliance to cross the line with two balls to spare. He struck eleven boundaries and four sixes before falling to medium pacer Basil Thampi, who had him caught by Tanmay Agarwal. Jaggi also scored a vital 51 in East Zone's win over   on Tuesday.
