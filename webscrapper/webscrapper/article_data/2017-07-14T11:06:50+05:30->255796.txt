BHOPAL: In an unusual move the   (BMHRC) has cut down surgeries and assigned use of operation theatres (OTs)to each of the five critical departments once every week. The extraordinary notice issued by hospital administration allocated one day a week to respective departments to use OTs. 

 The move comes in the wake of shortage of staff, especially anaesthetists, at the premier super-speciality hospital that caters to the healthcare of Bhopal gas victims. "We have been given only one OT day per week. This way we'll be able to perform only one or two surgeries per week," stated a letter from a senior consultant. 
 
 Some consultants placing the administration on record suggested BMHRC administration would be responsible for any untoward incident or loss of life for over delays.
 
 Each of the departments were issued directive to carry out surgeries on assigned days. On Saturday, peripheral anaesthesia services are coordinated. Hospital administered by   government's department of health research has been facing acute shortage of doctors. "It is a new low for the hospital. Situation has never been like this. There are over five lakh gas victims who are dependent for free medical care," said activist Abdul Jabbar.
