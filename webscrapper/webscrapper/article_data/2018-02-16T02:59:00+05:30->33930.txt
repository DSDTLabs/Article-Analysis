Visakhapatnam: A high-level videoconference will be held in the city on Friday to iron out obstacles in the free movement of Nepal-bound containers via train from the Vizag port.

 The Indian Railways’ Container Corporation of Indian Ltd (Concor) transports the containers from Vizag to Birgunj in Nepal.
 
 An eight-member team from the Nepal embassy, representatives from Vizag port, Customs and Concor will take part in the meet.
 
 Due to delay in certain formalities like clearance of the Import General Manifesto (IMG) and Export General Manifesto (EMG), Vizag port is unable to deliver the containers to Concor which transports goods to Nepal. The Himalayan country imports several goods like fruits, medicines and cellphones from China, Africa and Europe.
 
 Because of the delay in official procedures, nearly 700 Nepal-bound containers were stuck at Vizag port for two months.
 
 “We can release containers to Concor in one day if we have documents like IMG and EMG. However, lack of documents will hold up the containers,”   managing director MT Krishnababu told TOI.
