Malayalam actor   was recently seen in the lead role in a one-minute film about road safety awareness, exhorting drivers to avoid high-beam lights and use dim lights for safety at night, especially in cities.

 However, the actor was in for a surprise when he was driving from Kozhikode to Palakkad via Perunthalmanna, on July 9 and that urged him to go live on his social media page with a message for the authorities. Apparently, for about 80 to 90 kilometers, there was no street light on the highway he was driving on, which forced the motorists to use high beam lights, for their own safety. "I was part of a campaign against high beam lights and so, never wanted to be a bad example by not following it myself. However, it is conditions like this that forces our motorists to use high beam lights," says the actor, in the video.
 
  
  
 While a few commented that he should have acted in such a film after understanding the ground realities and not just for money, Unni responded saying that he had not taken any remuneration for it.
