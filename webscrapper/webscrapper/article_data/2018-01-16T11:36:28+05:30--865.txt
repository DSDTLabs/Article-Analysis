YAVATMAL: The Yavatmal office of BSNL has put a woman junior telecom officer (JTO) under suspension for committing fraud in caste certificate submitted to the office. Police have registered an offence against accused   Bhaskarrao Parate under Maharashtra SC/ST Caste Certificate Verification Act, 2001.

 According to a document, an assistant general manager  , who was asked by her senior to lodge an FIR against Chhaya, was also found to be submitting a bogus certificate along with Chhaya husband, Ashok Bende. All three belong to Khosti caste which comes under special backward category.
 
 Chhaya has applied for an anticipatory bail which is posted for hearing on January 23.
 
 According to sources, Chhaya first obtained the bogus certificate of   tribe from the Yavatmal executive magistrate in 1986 which was declared invalid in 1987. She again obtained the same caste certificate on June 22, 1989, and got a clerical job in BSNL in 1991.
 
 A committee appointed by the BSNL’s corporate office, New Delhi, too declared Chhaya’s certificate invalid.
 
 Chhaya’s husband, Ashok Bende, who was holding the general manager’s post, deliberately ignored the committee findings, leading his wife to remain in service till she was suspended by the new GM (telecom) Nitin Chahande.
 
 The sources further said Chahande asked Manju, the assistant general manager, to file an FIR against erring Chhaya. “Khodwe did lodge the FIR but later applied for   along with Ashok Bende following the fear of getting booked in the same case,” source said. 
 
 Ashok Bende is on leave and Manju refused to speak to media when contacted for her reaction.
