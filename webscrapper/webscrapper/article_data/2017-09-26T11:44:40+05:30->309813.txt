 Tipped off by informants
 
 â€œOur informants had alerted us that they would come near the swimming pool and wait for their agents who will exchange new currency for the banned ones. Policemen disguised in civvies were deployed in the area. Everything went accordingly and the accused, who had parked their car near the pool, sensed something amiss and tried to speed away . We detained them and seized the banned currencies," police said.
