LUCKNOW: Congress workers, led by   president  , observed on a daylong fast at the party's headquarters in Lucknow on Monday to protest against the "feeling of fear, suppression and intimidation" which they said that had taken root in society under the   rule. 

 "In this environment of intimidation, only the voice of power, weapons and police uniform is being heard. Everyone else is being ignored. This generation, which is living in fear, needs to remember that Gandhi ji had brought the entire country together, irrespective of caste, religion, and region. Independence was won through non-violence.  , who this government is trying to appropriate, is the same person who gave us the Constitution that promises equality for everyone," said Babbar.
 
 Accusing BJP of having greatly harmed any kind of civilized dialogue or behaviour in the country, Babbar said that its latest act of painting a statue of Ambedkar saffron and changing his name in official usage to Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, smacked of dictatorship. Dictatorship, he added, had no place in a democracy like India and all like-minded parties should join hands to ensure defeat for BJP in the next elections. 
 
 "Will BJP decide how we should remember any great person in this country by changing his or her name and clothes? Next we will not be able to refer to even Lord Krishna as   or anything else that he is fondly called in the country. BJP will decide for us what his name should be," he said.
