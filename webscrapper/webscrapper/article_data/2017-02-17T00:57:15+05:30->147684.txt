MUMBAI: There would be no shortage of power in   as BEST was prepared to meet the demand surge associated with the season, said BEST general manager Jagdish Patil on Thursday.

 “We have procurement of 950 MW to supply   to 10.5 lakh consumers in the island city,” Patil said. “Besides, we can procure additional power upto 150 MW and in emergency we can purchase it from the power exchange.”
 
 BEST also plans an awareness campaign on consumption above  , which can cause power cuts.
 
 “We will provide citizens with a chart on how much electricity (in watts) will be consumed per bulb, fan, tubelight, AC, geyser, etc,” an official said. “You can compute the average consumption in your house and compare this with the sanctioned load mentioned on electricity bill.”
 
 The issue came up at the BEST committee meeting on Thursday, with acting chairman Yakub Memon seeking detection of such cases and giving residents six months to either reduce consumption or upgrade the cables.
 
 An official said people add ACs and appliances and cross the sanctioned load. “The problem worsens when other residents exceed the load at the same time; this overheats the cable and leads to power cuts,” the official said.
