RANCHI: For the first time in the city, fine was imposed on men found openly urinating in public places. A team of   (RMC) officials organised a drive on Tuesday to nab those who were found urinating openly alongside the streets. 

 City manager Sandeep Kumar said, "It was the first day of the fine collection so we organised a drive just for a short while to make people realise that urinating publically will no more be acceptable in the city."
 
 On the first day of the drive near   and five people were fined with Rs. 100 each as per the provisions in Jharkhand State Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.
 
 Kumar said, "We chose Kutchehry Chowk because we have newly constructed urinals there but despite that people are seen urinating on roadside." 
 
 The drive will now be conducted on a daily basis by the RMC employees until marshals are not appointed.
 
 The people around Kutchehry appreciated the efforts of RMC.  , who has an office near Kutchehry said, "Everyday people used to come and urinate right next to our office leaving the whole area smelling like public toilet. At least now we will be able to escape this stench."
