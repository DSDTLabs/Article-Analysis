QUEPEM: Water in the 17km Portuguese-era   canal, which once served as a source for drinking, irrigation and domestic use may be unsafe.

  Citizens have alleged that water from septic tanks and soak pits from two housing complexes is overflowing into the canal.
 
 The two residential complexes which are located behind the police deputy superintendent’s office are openly discharging sewage water in the canal, citizens alleged.
 
 Local physician Dr Umesh Netravalker has written to the Quepem Municipal Council (QMC), the health officer at the primary health centre and the deputy collector on the issue.“Water from overflowing septic tanks behind the buildings accumulates in a large area before it reaches in the canal. The stagnant water emits a foul smell in the entire area. The mosquito menace is also increasing” the complaint stated.
 
 Flat owners, meanwhile, allege that the builder has cheated them by not providing adequate sewage disposal infrastructure. “Authorities must initiate action against the builder, ” a flat owner said.
 
 “Authorities, such as town and country planning department and QMC have blindly issued clearances even though the complex is in a low lying area,” Rosa Fernandes, another flat owner said.
