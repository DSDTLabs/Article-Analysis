BENGALURU: Former finalists   exploited the weakness of TC Sports Club’s second choice custodian Ibrahim Nadheem Adam to the hilt as they booked their place in the Group stages of the   with a 5-0 rout here on Tuesday.

 
 The match, which the visiting Maldives club had to win big after losing 2-3 at Male, became a no-contest before the half hour mark. The Blues, who again started without skipper  , quickly realized that there was a chance to score with almost every shot on goal. Their first chance came in the 9th minute but Spaniard Antonio Dovale blasted it wide even as the pocket-sized Nadheem, who came in for injured ‘keeper Dmitry Asnin of Belarus, heaved a sigh of relief.
 
 But Nadheem’s luck didn’t last long as Dovale made amends with a stinging shot, three minutes later. By this time the BFC players had taken note of the ‘keeper’s limited skills and Dovale found his second following a corner. A minute later, Nadheem had no place to hide when Aussie Erik Paartalu floated in the third goal from outside the box. By now even the handful of BFC fans had sorted it out and they were shouting “shoot, shoot, shoot” every time the Blues launched an attack. Even after changing ends, there was no let up from Bengluru as the wave of attacks continued. Dovale then completed his hat-trick three minutes after restart.
 
 The Blues will now open their campaign in Group E against   on March 7. Their first home match will be against Bangladesh club Dhaka Abahani here on March 14.
