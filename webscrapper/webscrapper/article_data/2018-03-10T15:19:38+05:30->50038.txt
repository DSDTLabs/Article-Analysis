PATNA: The   on Friday ordered the state government to submit a counter affidavit about the mechanism to hire law officers for courts across the state under the Bihar Law Officers Engagement Rule, 2017.

 The division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice   asked if the state government under the rule would hire the law officers as its permanent employees under Article 309 of the Constitution or under an executive order or a policy decision.
 
 The bench was hearing a batch of petitions filed by Vijay Kumar Vimal, Deepak Kumar and Anjana Gupta, who have challenged the several clauses in the Rule made effective on October 20 last year.
 
 Sources said it is for the first time that such a rule has been brought by the state government, defining conditions by which the advocates would be hired as law officers. Earlier, there were no such rules for hiring law officers in the state.
 
 While Dinu Kumar and   argued for the petitioner,   represented the state government.
 
 While seeking clarification, the court asked the government if the law officers would be hired through the new Rule under Article 309, all the benefits given to a government employee would have to be provided to them and they could not be removed any time as per the government’s wish.
 
 The petitioners’ counsels argued that under the new rules, lawyers having at least 20 years of experience would only be eligible for appointment as additional advocate general and senior standing counsel in the Supreme Court, whereas Article 217 states that at least 10 years of experience is required to become eligible for being a high court judge or an advocate general.
 
 The court stated that the above rule is just as an offer to advocates made by the state government, which might even be refused by them. The court fixed March 20 as the next date of hearing on the matter.
