The peppy number   on the   album, featuring   and  , is perhaps the best and grandest song in terms of visuals because of the magic by ace Bollywood art director  , who has worked in films like Barfi, Jagga Jasoos and more. Rajat put up amazing sets that combine fantasy elements with reality in this song. Shot in the Ooty forests, the set was very elaborate. The art department did a commendable job everyday, as they had to start at 3 am to put up the set, only to dismantle it at 6 pm due to forest department restrictions, and then put it up again the next day.
Director Anup (Bhandari) who is also the lyricist and music composer of the film, roped in a 60-member orchestra playing violins, cellos, etc., to create a number that blends the essence of a 90s romantic song in a contemporary way. The legendary Sax Raja, who has arranged music for Hamsalekha, Ilayaraja conducted the orchestra for the songs. 
 Anup got singer Deepak Doddera for the Kannada version, while he sung it for the Telugu version, Ninnu Nenu Preminchanantu.
