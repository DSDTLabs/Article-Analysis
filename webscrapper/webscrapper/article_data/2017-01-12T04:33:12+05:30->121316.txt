KALYAN: Taking the digital leap, a local   is launching a   to deliver fresh produce at the doorsteps of consumers in  . As the union has 1,690 hawkers as members, the vegetables will be delivered at home within a couple of hours of placing the order — and buyers will have the option of making   or cash.

 The 'Smart Fresh Vegetables' app of the Bhaji Pala Falfule Feriwala Kalyankari Sanstha was unveiled on Tuesday by local MLA   and Kalyan APMC market chief Ravindra Godvinde. 
 
 “The app will be available for download next week,” said Prashant Mali, who runs the Sanstha. 
 
 Mali said, "The idea struck me when my friend Murli Paraki said all businesses are going digital and that we should also try something different to boost the business of hawkers. Then we started working on the plan. Now, the app is almost ready and it will be available for download soon.”
 
 Paraki said, "It will benefited all those who did not have time to go in to market as through app they will get fresh vegetables available in market at their doorstep". To start with, they plan to focus on the posh localities of the city.
 
 Paraki said, "A team will monitor orders on the app. They will take fresh vegetables from hawkers and supply it to consumers.” The app service will be initially available within Kalyan city only, and based on its sucess, expanded to nearby places later.
