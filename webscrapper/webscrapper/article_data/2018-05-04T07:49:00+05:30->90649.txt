Ludhiana: Joint commissioner of MC Anita Darshi has issued a show-cause notice to two executive engineers of the buildings and roads department to justify reasons behind poor quality of roads in zone A and D.

 However, officers claimed that they were getting the patchwork done in areas and they would justify their position.
 
 In the show-cause notice, Darshi has said she found condition of roads (Jawaddi road, Dugri road and Dugri Bridge) pathetic during inspection. In the letter, she has also mentioned that premix (28.13 tonnes) was issued for patchwork in zone D on April 17, 18 and 19, but condition of roads has not improved.
 
 A similar notice has been issued to an official for roads in zone A. Both the officials have been asked to explain where the patchwork was done in the past one month.
 
 Civic officials had courted controversy due to poor construction of roads after residents or some RTI activists had raised the issues. But this time, the matter has been highlighted by an officer of the MC.
 
 Sources revealed that sometimes the officials have to change the plan of road construction or patchwork under pressure of political leaders which is a possibility in these cases too.
 
 Joint commissioner Anita Darshi said she had inspected some roads and found some shortcomings. “Though I have issued show-cause notices, this is an internal matter and officers can justify their stand,” she added.
