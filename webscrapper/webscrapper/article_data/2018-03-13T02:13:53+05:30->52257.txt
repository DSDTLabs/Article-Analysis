Gurugram: Some three years ago, the MCG had announced that it would   all community   with recycled sewerage water. But recycled water is used at only three locations in the city at present, an RTI query has revealed.

 According to the response given by the MCG to an RTI application filed by Aseem Takyar, a city-based RTI activist, treated water from   sewage treatment plant (STP) is being used at only three parks — the community parks in Sector 15 (part 2) and old DLF on MG road, and Biodiversity Park.
 
 “In 2015 and 2016, the authorities made an announcement to use recycled water in parks and green belts on a large scale. But the project has still not been implemented. Although water shortage hits the city every year in summer, parks and green belts are not watered with treated water,” Takyar said.
 
 He added, “The lack of recycled water has led to overconsumption of groundwater for construction purposes. There is no system in place to provide recycled water for many construction sites. It is leading to illegal extraction of groundwater.”
 
 Experts said the treated water could be used to deal with the water crisis in the city.  , a hydrologist, said: “Recycling sewage water seems to be the only way forward for the city, as groundwater tables are fast depleting and water bodies are steadily drying up. While canal water is used strictly for drinking, treated sewage water could be used for cleaning, gardening and all other purposes.”
 
 In 2015, the corporation had planned to install 56 STPs in Gurugram. The civic authorities made an announcement to lay dedicated pipelines for recycled water in old and new Gurugram the next year. Currently, over 170 million litres of waste water is treated daily in the city. While some of it is used at construction sites and for irrigation, a large amount is released into an 8km-long drain that flows to the Yamuna.
