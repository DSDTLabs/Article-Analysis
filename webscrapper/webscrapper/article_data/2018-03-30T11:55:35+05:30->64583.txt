TRICHY: Six years after KN   was murdered, his family hopes that the   investigation will bring the culprits to book.

 His elder brother and former DMK MLA KN   told TOI that CBI officials have made enquires with the drivers and business partners of Ramajeyam. “I have met the   in Chennai and replied to their queries. The conduct of their investigation has given us hope that there will be a progress in the case soon,” he said on Ramajeyam’s death anniversary here on Thursday. 
 
 In these six years, the case has been transferred to three investigation agencies. After Trichy city police and CB-CID made no breakthrough in the case, CBI took over and registered a fresh case in January this year, as per the directions of the Madurai bench of Madras high court.
 
 Left with the frustration over the failure of the investigation agencies, Nehru expressed his anguish over the pain that was caused by his brother’s mysterious murder. “Lost is lost. But we want to know the reason behind the murder and that will give a solace to our hearts,” he said Nehru.
 
 It may be recalled that the special crime branch of the CBI in Chennai had sought information about the murderers from the public on Wednesday.
