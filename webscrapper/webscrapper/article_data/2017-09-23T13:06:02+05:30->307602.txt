CHANDIGARH: For the second consecutive year, the sanitation department of the Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh headed by MOH, leads in terms of receiving complaints on the MC   cell. The number of complaints attended to and the level of satisfaction have also increased vis-a-vis the previous year. 

 Municipal commissioner Baldeo Purushartha on Friday held a meeting to check the status and progress of the MC’s grievance cell and also paid heed to the problems faced by employees and officers while dealing with the complaints.
 
 “During the monsoons, complaints of waterlogging and sewage enhance every season, but overall, the number of complaints has gone down. Maximum complaints were received from sanitation and related issues. It has been observed that there is a dire need to address the particular area,” said sources from the MC.
 
 Since, it was a monthly review of the grievance cell of the MC, the concerned department maintained the data from all the departments and the same was compared with the previous date and number of received complaints.
 
 “We received satisfactory feedback this time on most of the attended complaints, but since we deal with daily civic issues, it is challenge to maintain the level of satisfaction among the residents. Since we have created a kind of system, through which we can get the exact grievance, the concerned officer has to attend it immediately as it passes through the senior officers and no one can ignore any single grievance”, said a senior officer of the MC.
