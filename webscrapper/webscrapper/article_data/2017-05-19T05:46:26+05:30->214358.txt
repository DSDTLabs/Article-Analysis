Dharwa used metal thread art painting to draw pictures with subjects ranging from women, trees, houses and waterfalls. Dharwa started this unique way of painting two and a half years ago and was included in   in October last year.

 Dharwa, 61, who lives in  , started the metal thread art painting as he was fond of creating new forms of art.
 
 The certificate issued by IBR states that Dharwa created a new national record for ‘Metal Thread Art Paintings’ and it has been accepted by India Book of Records.
 
 “The details of your achievement have been entered into our record database. Dharwa created 21 paintings using metal threads on nature and environment, human life and development as on December 8,” states the certificate awarded to Dharwa by IBR.
 
 Speaking about his work, Dharwa said, “I was fond of making best from waste, so when I got retired, I decided to do some work of art.”
 
 “I picked up painting, but took a challenge that the picture should be made without using paints. I decided to use metal and copper wire to make the painting. The first painting I made took around 5 months to complete,” said Dharwa.
 
 Dharwa uses black acrylic sheet to embed the threads to make a picture and dust of copper and brass as colours. “This work needs patience and I have to work on it for 10 to 12 hours at a stretch. Now, I can complete my work within two months,” he said.
