JAIPUR: Twenty-five-year-old  , who died after being trapped in the   at  , along with four other persons of a family on Saturday, was dreaming to be an   (IAS). 

 “He was studying in a private university in Jaipur for past four years. It was his fourth year of BA LLB. After completing it, he was planning to appear in entrance exam for Indian Administrative Services (IAS). He had a long way to go,” said Shaurya’s father, Amit Agarwal, who was inconsolable after cremating his son in Vidhyadhar Nagar on Sunday. “Shaurya was happy and made others happy too,” said Agarwal. 
 
 Agarwal reached Jaipur from Uttarakhand late on Saturday night after being informed about the incident by his relatives. In the fire incident, Shaurya’s three cousins (two girls and a boy) were killed along with their grandfather. It was the house of Shaurya’s paternal aunt (bua). “Last time he talked to me was on Friday. He was happy as he told me that he was going to his buaji’s house. Saturday and Sunday were holidays. In Jaipur, Makar sankranti is celebrated in a big way, so he wanted to be at his buaji’s house rather than staying at hostel,” said Agarwal. 
 
 Agarwal said that before going to sleep at his buaji’s house, he had called his mother at 12 midnight. “It was the last time, we heard his voice. He told his mother that he would call her again tomorrow but that day never came,” said Agarwal. 
 
 The massive fire at 4 am engulfed the entire two-storeyed independent house Shanti Kunj, burning it to ashes before anyone from the neighbourhood became aware of it. The five victims, including senior citizen Mahendra Garg and his grandchildren, are said to have woken up and cried for help after the fire spread through the house.
 
 Shaurya’s buaji (aunt) and his uncle Sanjiv Garg, who owns a steel factory, were in Agra to attend a wedding. They were informed about the fire by a neighbour.
