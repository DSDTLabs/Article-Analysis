 The board has arranged for metal detectors, physical frisking, police deployment and videography of each candidate to prevent unfair practice during the test. Also, no one will be allowed inside the centres after 9.30am.
 
 “The CBSE chairman discussed the arrangements in detail with state governments for smooth conduct of the examination. The states have extended their support for the process, including police deployment,” said a senior CBSE official. There are over 2,000 centres across 103 cities/ towns where this year’s exam will be conducted, in which foreigners, Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) will also appear for the first time.
 
 “There is no scope of any impersonation. Videography arrangements have been made at all the centres. However, there will be no disruption due to this and the aspirants may not even realise they are being videographed,” said the official.
 
 No one, except the candidates, will be allowed inside the centres.
