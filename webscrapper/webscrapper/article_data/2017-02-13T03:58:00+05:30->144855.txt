Panaji: Chimbel villagers have brought to the notice of the panchayat another violation of hill cutting in a no-development zone in Chinchwada after the panchayat issued a stop work notice on a violation last week. The project promoter has not displayed any board to provide details of the road and the construction built at the site. Chimbel Manch, a local NGO has written a letter to the panchayat with details of the violation on a slope with a steep gradient, shown as no development zone (NDZ) in regional plan 2021.  The villagers have questioned the panchayatâ€™s silence in the matter.
