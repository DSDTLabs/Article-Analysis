Trichy: Continuing the anti-encroachment drive, Trichy Corporation on Saturday removed several vendors creating obstruction and traffic snarl-ups in Woraiyur here. The drive began at the Woraiyur vegetable market, the officials pulling down unauthorized shelters under which illegal shop owners kept their things causing obstructions to easy customer movements.

 As many as 60 wayside vendors were also forced to leave the areas after being found encroaching on the roads. The officials from Trichy Corporation kicked off the action at Wallaja road, Victoria road in Woraiyur.
 
 The drive was particularly aimed at evicting all vendors who have illegally occupied both the sides of the stretches and caused disturbances to the free movement of the vehicles and the pedestrians. The public alleged the unauthorized sellers on the roadside obstructed their movement from morning till night.
 
 “Crossing the Woraiyur market area through Wallaja road and Victoria road was not difficult when the area was busy with vendors. The congestion had affected normal public movement. The   has freed up some space,” said D Raj, a resident from Kura Theru in Woraiyur. The official also removed structures found protruding onto the pavements
 
 Though a heavy police protection was present in the area for smooth conduct of eviction, the officials did not face any strong opposition from the encroachers.
 
  It may be recalled that the district collector had already ordered to clear the encroachments across the district particularly within the city limits a few months ago. Following this, the officials of Trichy Corporation and the state highways department carried out the eviction.
