Madurai: A high-tech corrective surgery for refractive errors to eliminate the need for glasses was performed on two truck drivers at the Dr Agarwalâ€™s Eye Hospital recently.

 According to medical director of the hospital, Dr S Bernard Albert Rajkumar, the drivers, Vinoth and Venkatesh, who are twins and aged 26 years were affected by blurred and dim night vision characterised by glare, which would affect their vision and hence their livelihood.
 
 Taking up the challenge, the hospital, Madurai performed a simple 10-minute zyoptix procedure using high-end sophisticated technology to deliver precise treatment for perfect vision correction. The new personalised laser vision correction system is unique to each eye for sharp, clear and accurate vision.
 
 The eye is mapped in detail and imperfections called higher order aberrations are marked. These minute flaws can affect the finer aspects of eyesight and are responsible for experiencing glare, halos, blurring, starburst patterns or even double vision.
 
 Speaking about their eyesight after the procedure, the two patients said they were glad to be able have regained their eyesight, without having to go for glasses which would affect their livelihood.
