KOLKATA: The   ( ) is planning to come up with new ideas to develop cities that would predominantly have the happiness quotient.The authorities are planning to collaborate with the   to explore ideas on this.

 An official said that a city or township could be `happy' in nature by ensuring that citizens commute and travel from one place to another in much less time and by having less traffic jam and by having zones of recreation and entertainment, a sense of safety and security , centres of yoga, meditation, sports arena and a feel-good look in the public spaces.
 
 The Hidco authorities have already contacted the IIT-Kharagpur expressing intentions to work on this idea. “Proper planning and guidelines are needed to consciously and sci entifically proceed on this project.IIT-Kharagpur will send a team to conduct a survey and make an assessment to identify areas for improvement in New Town to make the township a happy place to live in,“ an official said. During the international symposium held at New Town on the prospects and challenges of future cities, it was felt that future cities need to recognize human behaviour as a design tool. The concept was introduced by a professor from Amsterdam who ela borated by explaining that the pedestrians-cyclists-motorcyclists-busestrains-ferries conflict and chaos in a central part of Amsterdam was taken care by making the zone a pedestrian plaza as humans were more efficient in criss-crossing each other in a chaotic origin-destination situation.“Tapping on human behaviour could become a key element in developing future cities that would have the happiness quotient,“ Hidco officials said.
 
 Urban planning experts from different international universities like the University of Columbia, University of Tokyo, University of Edinburgh and experts from IIT-Kharagpur participated in the international workshop on future cities at New Town recently in which they discussed ways on how to develop smart cities that will have a balance of smart technologies and nature. The IIT team will soon give a synopsis document to the Hidco authorities so that they can make an assessment.
