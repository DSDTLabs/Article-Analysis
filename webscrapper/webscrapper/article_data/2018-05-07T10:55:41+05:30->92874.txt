HYDERABAD: General   is a man for all seasons, helping Indians stranded abroad, by taking the battle to the forefront.

 “We have done all we could to help Indian workers stuck in Kuwait,”   told TOI on the sidelines of the “Deccan Dialogues” initiative at ISB in Hyderabad. In January, Singh travelled to   after thousands of Indian workers employed with a major company faced problems. Their salaries were not released and they were also not allowed to leave the country. Following his intervention, they were able to return to India. “Some chose to stay back. That is their decision, but we took measures to get back everyone,” he said.
 
 There has been a proposal to shift Indians serving prison terms in foreign countries to complete their sentence in Indian jails by sending them home. To this query, V K Singh said not much headway has been made. “We have to respect the law of land of any country,” he said.
 
 The minister said he took a similar position in strifetorn Yemen in 2015. During Operation Rahat, Singh coordinated the evacuation of more than 5,000 Indian workers who returned to India by special flights from war zone.
 
 On people losing jobs abroad, especially in the Gulf, the minister said this was a reality and attributed it to economic reasons. He said it was beyond the purview of the government to protect jobs of Indians if companies were shutting down.
