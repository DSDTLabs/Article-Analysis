HYDERABAD: All India Majlis-eIttehadul Muslimeen president   ridiculed Prime Minister   for his `open arms' welcome to UAE crown prince  .

 When the prince arrived in New Delhi to participate in India's Independence Day celebrations as chief guest, Modi's gestures amused Owaisi.
 
 Addressing a public meeting in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, late on Wednesday evening, Asaduddin Owaisi said, “We respect our guests and the Prince definitely should have been welcomed befittingly. But it looked like Modi had forgotten to do his yoga in the morning. So when the prince arrived in the evening, by his gestures, it looked like he was doing yoga with his open arms.If Modi has so much love for a 'dhadiwala' from abroad, why does he not show the same love to `dhadiwalas' in India?“ He was careful in not using the word `Muslims' as it would have violated the   or ders on seeking votes in the name of religion.
 
 The MIM leader also got an applause when he referred to   leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav, as a 'drama company'. “The `bade miyan and chote miyan' are taking people for a ride by saying there is development in Uttar Pradesh. It is only the family which has benefitted, so far, not the common man,“ he said. Owaisi also questioned the claims of Akhilesh Yadav over the 'so-called' development that had taken place in UP.
