GURUGRAM: The rumours of Class XII   paper being leaked in Delhi did not cause much anxiety among Gurugram students. After appearing for the accounts   on Thursday, some students were of the opinion the paper was lengthy, while others said it was easier than expected. 

 “The accounts paper was far easier than what we had expected. The best thing about it was that I was able to complete it on time,” said Pranav Agarwal of DPS, Sector 45. 
 
 Meanwhile, Rohan Panesar, another DPS student, said, “Part B of the question paper was easy. However, questions 16 and 17 in Part A were quite lengthy.” 
 
 Neha Baweja, another Class XII student in the city, resonated his thoughts, saying, “I felt question 17 was lengthy. The rest I was prepared for. I expected the paper to be really tough, but it wasn’t that hard at all.”
 
 Students were clueless about rumours of the accounts paper being leaked in Delhi and unanimously said they don’t want to take the exam again, as it would mean reliving the stress. “I had no clue about the leak. Moreover, it was reported in Delhi and not Gurugram. The paper went okay but that doesn’t mean we want to to sit for it again. A new date means preparing for this lengthy exam again, which is not easy,” said Pranav, another Class XII student. 
 
  officials at Panchkula, however, said the accounts paper in Gurugram went off without any glitch. The examination has not been cancelled and it won’t be held again, he said.
