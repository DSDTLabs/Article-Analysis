CHANDIGARH: Police on Wednesday arrested a two-member gang of ATM cheats who have duped 150 persons to the tune of Rs 35 lakh by changing their ATM cards on the pretext of helping them in their transactions. Identified as Sandeep Kumar (30) and Sanjeet Kumar (22), the accused hail from a criminal tribe settled on the outskirts of Hansi town of Hisar.

 Police said thge duo had confessed to have cheated many people in the border villages and cities of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan over the past three years. They will be produced before the court on Thursday.
 
 “They had a plain modus operandi. They would carry the expired cards of all banks and stand outside the ATM kiosks. After spotting a person struggling to use the card, they would come to their rescue. They would help him withdraw the money and later deceitfully return an expired card to the unsuspecting victims. Unmindful of the fraud, the person would leave. Later both would withdraw money from the ATM using the card,” said inspector Narinder Singh, in-charge of the criminal investigation agency (CIA) wing of Hansi police.
 
 “The victims learnt about the fraud only after we contacted and informed them about it,” said Narinder.
 
 According to information, police had been receiving complaints about both the persons. Since the duo had been operating in neighbouring districts only, the CIA team had deployed its men around the ATM kiosks and laid the trap.
 
 Expressing inability to share further details, Narinder said acting on a tip-off, his team apprehended the two when they were about to cheat one more person. Nearly 50 ATM cards of various banks were recovered from them.
