Vadodara: Godhra Congress MLA C K Raulji has kept everyone guessing regarding the sides he plans to take. While it was widely believed that he would side with former opposition leader in the state assembly Shankarsinh Vaghela and resign, he has not done so and at the same time he has not gone with the Congress MLAs to Bangalore.

 Raulji is a known aide of Vaghela and it was expected that he would resign along with others. Raulji was also seen in Gandhinagar on Friday around the same time when Thasra Congress MLA Ramsinh Parmar resigned from Congress. While most had expected that Raulji would do so soon, he did not turn up in the assembly speaker’s office and later returned to Godhra.
 
 Godhra has been rife with speculation about Raulji ever since the party’s signboard and flags were removed from the bungalow that he uses as his office. With a new party office being made, even the Congress uses the same office. At that stage, Raulji had tried to quell rumours by stating that the house was merely being renovated.
 
 Raulji who began his political career from the Janta Dal had joined the BJP later. When Vaghela split the BJP and floated Rashtriya Janta Party (RJP) in 1995, Raulji went with him. Eventually, with the RJP merging with the Congress, Raulji too joined it. He has been a MLA for five terms and also a minister on three occasions.
 
 On being asked about what his plans were, Raulji said that he had not come to a decision as yet. “I will meet my supporters and workers before making any declaration,” he said. On being asked about his visit to Gandhinagar on Friday, Raulji said that he had gone for some other work and when it did not materialise he returned to Godhra.
