PATNA: A division bench of the Patna high   comprising Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Sudhir Kumar Singh, while hearing a PIL on Tuesday, asked the state government to file an affidavit within four weeks on the situation of four Ayush colleges and several Ayush centres across Bihar where positions of teaching staff and doctors are vacant for several years.

 Ayush stands for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy, which is a department under the ministry of health and family welfare.
 
 The PIL was filed by one Anand Kumar Singh this year. Singh’s counsel Brajesh Kumar said the four Ayush colleges at Buxar, Bhagalpur, Begusarai and Darbhanga were derecognised by the Central Council of Indigenous Medicine as they did not fulfil its norms.
 
 “No academic activity is taking place at these four colleges in which there are more than 400 vacancies of staff. Besides, posts for more than 400 Ayush doctors at block and sub-divisional level are vacant,” the counsel said, adding a State Ayush Mission was to be formed under the guidance of National Ayush Mission, but the state government was yet to form any mission.
 
 According to him, the state government has not taken steps on projects for 200-bed hospital in Patna and Muzaffarpur and a medicine laboratory for examining Ayush medicines in the state.
 
 “A committee of Ayush directorate was to be formed in the state health department, which is also pending,” the counsel added.
