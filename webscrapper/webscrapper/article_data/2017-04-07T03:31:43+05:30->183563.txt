NAVI MUMBAI: A charitable organization,  , has leased 17 flats in sector 27,  , to provide free accommodation to cancer patients undergoing treatment in the city. 

 Located opposite   in Kharghar, the accommodation is meant for patients who come from other cities. The trustees realized that these people had a hard time finding a place to stay. "We have made 17 flat available. While the accommodation is free, meals have to be purchased for Rs 10," said trustee  .
 
 The foundation, which is 10 years old, has around 40 members who volunteer their time and money for a number of causes. "We wanted to find accommodation close to   in Kharghar, and once we zeroed in on a premise, we spoke to the developer who willingly leased the rooms," he continued.
 
 The foundation also requested the hospital authorities to start free bus services ferrying patients from Kharghar to Parel and back. 
 
 "Two buses leave Kharghar at 8am and at noon and start the return trip from Parel at 2pm and 6pm," Gupta added.
 
 Currently, all the rooms are occupied and Gupta said the foundation was now scouting around for more accommodation. "We have been getting a lot of requests for rooms but the space is limited," he said.
