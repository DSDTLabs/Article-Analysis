Vadodara: A resident of Pune has filed a complaint of criminal intimidation against his relatives residing at Warasia after he was threatened by them when he went to meet his daughter and estranged wife. 

 Complainant Sandeep Budhrani has alleged that when he came to the city in January 2016 to meet his five-year-old daughter and wife Yasika, his uncle-in-law Naresh Dariyanani and his mother-in-law Bharti Virvani asked him to return to Pune. Police said the accused threatened Budhrani to go away, otherwise they would beat him up by calling goons and register false cases against him.
 
 While his case of restitution of conjugal rights is going on in a family court in Pune, Budhrani was allowed by the court to meet his daughter on the premises of Vadodara family court once a month. Later Budhrani was also allowed virtual access over Google hangout during Diwali holidays last year.
 
 Accordingly, when Budhrani was chatting, his brother-in-law Tapan Virvani, who had come to the city from the USA, threatened him with life if he did not withdraw his case from Pune court. Budhrani told police that all these while he was trying to get his wife back so that he need not have to register a case to meet his daughter.
 
 Budhrani was working with a multinational company dealing in oil and gas supplies in Dubai. But in January 2016 when Budhrani had come to Pune, his wife had left for Vadodara with their daughter without intimating him, creating misgivings between them.
