Mysuru: Demanding that the party initiate action against former Union minister  , for his tweet in which he purportedly targeted public works minister  , leaders of the Dalit Sangarsha Samiti (DSS) said that the former must have thought before making such remarks.

 “Moily is ant-Dalit. The senior Congress leader opposed Dalit leader B Basavalingappa from becoming the chief minister,” said DSS leader Somashekar.
 
 He urged Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) to initiate action against Moily, for making false allegations against Mahdevappa.
 
 The DSS leaders also want Mahadevappa to contest the upcoming assembly elections from Nanjangud constituency. “We will launch an effective campaign if Mahadevappa contests from Nanjangud,” the member said.
