PUNE: Police on Friday rescued a 4-year-old boy kidnapped for   on March 23 and arrested a   and his relative. 

 Sandeep Thokal (30) had allegedly kidnapped  , a kindergarten student while he was waiting outside an English medium school in Chakan. He had kept the boy at the residence of his relative,   (35), in Bhugaon. Thokal was a close friend of the boy’s father, police said. 
 
 Rudra’s mother, Ashwini, had registered a complaint of kidnapping against some unidentified people with the Chakan police station after he did not return home. The kidnapper had not contacted his parents for 11 days. 
 
 On April 4, Thokal, whose identity was then not known, sent a text message to the boy’s father in Hindi. “He demanded a ransom of Rs 15 lakh,” inspector (Chakan police station) Santosh Girigosavi said. He added that Thokal had made two phone calls to the boy’s father the same night, threatening him to kill Rudra if the ransom was not paid. 
 
 Girigosavi said Thokal had asked the boy’s father to hand over the money to him at Aurangabad railway station on April 5. A trap was laid, but the suspect did not reach the station, the inspector said. 
 
 “We formed two police teams, analysed CCTV footage of the suspect kidnapping the boy in a car and conducted technical investigation. We arrested Thokal from his hideout in Chinchwad where he had parked the car. During interrogation, Thokal revealed that he had kept the boy at Kavita’s house in Bhugaon. We rescued Rudra and arrested Kavita for helping Sandeep in the crime,” Girigosavi said.
 
 “Thokal had kidnapped the boy for ransom, with which he had planned to repay his car loan and tide over his financial constraints. It was found during investigation that Kavita had sought Rs 50,000 to keep the boy in her custody,” he added.
 
 Rudra’s father works with a private firm in Chakan. The parents got back the boy on completion of legal formalities, Girigosavi said.
