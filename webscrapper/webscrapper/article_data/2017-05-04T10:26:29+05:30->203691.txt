MUMBAI: Hours before  , her sister   has issued a lett-er alleging that   had worsened in the last three months and clarifying her stance on shifting her out for further treatment. 

 Contrary to bariatric surgeon Dr  's complaints against Semil's interference that resulted in a police complaint and his claims that the family's decision to move Eman to a UAE hospital was a mistake, Semil, in her letter, states: "Many things have been said about me and my family for Eman's medical care and our interaction...My humble request I want you know (sic) what is the truth before I go from India." TOI has a copy of the letter. 
 
 Semil, who believes that her words have been misconstrued for being "a conservative woman", has also disclosed screenshots of "WhatsApp chats" with Dr Lakdawala to "save my sister, family, our reputation". Semil refers to "false promises" assuring her places she could take Eman to once she could walk and later questions the case that was filed against her for giving water to Eman stating how, "Dr Mufazzal complained me about giving water but here he himself told me to give juice and chocolates to my sister". The chats show how Semil had insisted on using the elevator at their Alexan- dria home as it could bear Eman's weight, but he forced them to raze a wall and have Eman lifted by crane to grab eyeballs. She also shared pictures of Eman sitting on the bed 10 months ago, debunking his claims that bending could be dangerous for Eman.
