Tirunelveli: The 24-hour general strike call by the joint forum of trade unions in Kerala – to protest the central government’s decision to allow fixed tenure employment across sectors – affected inter-state road transport between Tamil Nadu and Kerala from the late hours of Sunday.

 Those returning from Thiruvananthapuram to Chennai after Easter holidays on Sunday managed to make their way while the fall out crowd that had booked tickets for Monday night had a tough time as bus services between the two states came to a halt around 11pm on Sunday.
 
 Some omni buses from Chennai to Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday night dropped their passengers at Thiruvananthapuram and returned to Kaliyakkavilai, in Kanyakumari district on Monday morning. The buses then made their way back to Thiruvananthapuram to pick up their passengers for the Thiruvananthapuram to Chennai journey on Monday night.
 
 The strike also affected movement of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) and Kerala State Transport Corporation buses. “More than 80 buses operating from Kanyakumari and Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram were stopped at Kaliyakkavilai from 11pm on Sunday,” a TNSTC official said and added that the buses would resume operation at 11pm on Monday.
