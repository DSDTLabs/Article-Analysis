MUMBAI: Cartoonist   (83), brother of playwright  , died of a brief illness in a hospital in Pune on Monday night. 

 When Tendulkar held his 90th solo exhibition in Pune this May, he had said he was not chasing after his 100th show. “I have crossed the 80s and this is my 90th exhibition. I view both these numbers with curiosity tempered with uncertainty,” he had said, adding that he will only think about holding his 91st show.
 
 But that 91st solo exhibition was not to be. Tendulkar, who had been suffering from bladder cancer for the last three years, was admitted to   on July 9 after he complained of pain.
 
 “He developed pulmonary embolism (blockage of an artery in the lungs) and died around 11pm on Monday,” said a doctor from the hospital. He is survived by wife, a son and a daughter. Tendulkar led an active life and expressed his straightforward views about civic issues, but the traffic chaos on Pune’s streets was on the top of his list. His cartoons depicting violations of traffic norms displayed at various signals across the city were instant hits.
 
 Tendulkar had taken to the streets to impress upon citizens the importance of following traffic rules. Many would remember him standing on Karve Road to create awareness on the topic. Each of his exhibitions would have at least 30 freshly drawn cartoons. “I feel some of my cartoons are becoming difficult to understand, just like me. So I display them on a board with a title ‘Agaadh Chitre’ (hard to understand), he had said in a note sent before the 90th exhibition.
 
 Tendulkar also wrote extensively in newspapers and magazines. He authored books like ‘Bhuichakra’, ‘Pocket Cartoons’ and ‘Sunday Mood’.
