SRINAGAR: A teenager was killed by a bullet-hit when he was throwing stones to disrupt the anti-terror operations of security forces against two hiding Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists at Padgampora in south Kashmir's   district on Thursday morning, director general of J&K police, S P Vaid said. 

 Amir Nazir, 15, was part of a mob pelting stones when a bullet hit him in the neck. The incident happened despite Army chief Bipin Rawat's recent warning against those attacking security forces during anti-militancy operations of "tough action". 
 
 The slain Lashkar terrorists were identified as Jehangir Ganai and Mohammad Shafi Wagay alias Ehsan, both locals from Koel in south Kashmir. 
 
 The security forces came under intense attack from stone pelters, which forced them to open fire, leaving several injured. While Nazir succumbed to the bullet-hit on the spot, six of the injured were shifted to hospital. 
 
 The encounter started when security forces cordoned off a few residential houses last night and started search operations. They faced heavy firing from the militants, police officials said. 
 
 As the news of the firing spread, people in large numbers gathered and started attacking security forces with stones in an attempt to break the cordon and help the militants flee. Clashes soon erupted at the encounter site and security forces restored to firing and lobbing teargas shells to disperse the protesters. Anti-riot police were also called in, but the mob refused to relent. 
 
 In a seperate incident, one Hizbul-e-Mujahedeen militant, Mustaq Seer, was killed in a brief encounter when he was traveling in a vehicle near
 Bandipora on Thursday.
