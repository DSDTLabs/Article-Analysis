FIR in   case: Acting on a complaint by   chief officer, Johnson Fernandes, Fatorda police on Thursday registered an FIR against Bharati   and others for using a forged ‘non-availability certificate’ pertaining to the registration of her birth, which bore the seal and sign of the civic body’s sub-registrar.

  The forgery came to light as Shirodkar’s year of birth was mentioned as 1966, while MMC maintains birth records from 1971 onwards. tnn
