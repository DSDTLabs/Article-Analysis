Panaji: Congress on Monday called for an all-party meeting to discuss the impact of the Supreme Court’s judgement quashing the 89 mining leases in the state.   unit president   said that the Manohar Parrikar-government must take all stakeholders into confidence while preparing a roadmap for the mining industry in Goa.

 Naik further said that because the chief minister had mishandled the iron ore mining policies, the state had suffered a loss of Rs 50,000 crore.
 
 “BJP should call a meeting of all political parties and ascertain their views as regards finding a solution to the vexed mining problems, and it should hold a separate meeting with stakeholders,” Naik said.
 
 Naik, while addressing reporters at Congress House, said that Parrikar has issued an order on September 10, 2012, paving the way for the closure of mining operations in Goa. The decision, Naik said, had left mine workers, truck owners, small traders, barge owners and several others jobless.
 
 “Manohar Parrikar should hang his head in shame for creating a mess of the mining industry and for mishandling of the mining issue thereby causing a loss of not less than Rs 50,000 crore and for not being able to convince the Supreme Court of India,” he said.
 
 The former   MP said that the state government had failed to convince the Supreme Court about the difference between fresh mining leases and renewal of mining leases. “The confusion between grant of fresh leases and renewal of leases could have been effectively dealt with by taking a clear and transparent approach. The Supreme Court and earlier the high court appeared to be totally confused while dealing with the mining cases,” Naik said.
 
 In order to prevent major mining companies from outside Goa from encroaching upon the mineral resources of the state, Naik has said that the government should explore all the legal options.
