The government decision comes as a great relief for students. Now we can avail this vital facility within the college campus itself. The RTO office is flocked by agents, even the RTO officers cannot pay attention to new comers owing the work load. If a RTO officer is comes specially to colleges, they will be able to give students attention.”
 
 Another student of   Priyanka Jadhav said, “The government has taken good decision. The RTO office is known for malpractices by the agents. Even though there is an online process of slotting appointments, agents are almost necessary to complete your work in time. Now, the government has come one step forward for our generation. This move will reduce the corruption at entry level as well.”
 
 The RTO officer of Kolhapur, DT Pawar said, “This is good decision by the ministry and we will implement it to the best of our ability. Most colleges are equipped with computer laboratories. We could conduct the learner licence online test on those computers. The questions will be different on each system and there is no chance of students cheating off of each-other. We could deploy an officer to conduct the test and procedures in colleges.”
