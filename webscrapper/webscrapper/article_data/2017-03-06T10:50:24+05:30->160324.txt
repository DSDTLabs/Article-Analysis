The buildings mostly dated back to the 19th and 20th century, while a few are even older. 
 
 “Every picture tells a story and every story has to be captured through the lens. This was the motto behind today’s photography session. In order to get the perfect light on the buildings, the photographers will come at various time for the next three-four days and click pictures of the heritage buildings. The best ones would be showcased in the exhibition,” said Hatangadi, who also explained the architectural and historical significance of the buildings before each photoshoot. SVS Ravi Kumar, faculty at the AU photography department and a member of Intach and Vizag Photowalkers, said, “This heritage photoshoot was a beautiful learning experience. Despite living in Vizag, many of us didn’t even know about these historic treasures. Once explained about the significance of the structures, the students could connect to the subjects and capture them through their lens.”
