AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) has opposed the power tariff hike sought by   (TPL) and the four distribution companies (discoms) affiliated to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL). The apex industry body in the state recommended that these discoms take measures to bring down the cost of electricity rather than burdening consumers with an increase in tariff.

  According to GCCI, TPL has sought a tariff increase of 31 paise per unit for Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar and 18 paise per unit for Surat for 2017-18. The private sector company also proposed to continue the regulatory charge of 45 paise, to recover revenue gaps from past years. The four state-run discoms have demanded a 53 paise per unit increase.
 
 “The twin proposals will put a burden of Rs 1,200 crore on electricity consumers,” GCCI said in an official statement.
 
 In its petition to Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC), the industry body maintained that TPL and the discoms should bring down power procurement and purchase cost.
 
 “Torrent Power should give preference to power purchase from bilateral GUVNL transactions, which will result in lowering the overall procurement cost and consumer tariff,” the association suggested.
 
 Among other suggestions, GCCI recommended that GUVNL reduce power purchase cost through a reduction in fixed costs. The petition filed by the trade body will be heard by the state power regulator, GERC, before approving tariffs for 2017-18.
