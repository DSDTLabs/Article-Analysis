NEW DELHI: Spelling   for Congress leader   Kumar, the Delhi high court on Thursday upheld a trial court order granting him anticipatory bail in two anti-Sikh riot cases of 1984.

 Justice Anu Malhotra dismissed the plea by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the 1984 anti-Sikh  , seeking to cancel Kumar’s anticipatory bail, saying that as per the records, Kumar was available throughout the investigation.
 
 “It has been submitted on his behalf that he shall continue to make himself available as well,” the court observed and noted that SIT failed to give any ground for cancelling the bail.
 
 HC had on December 12 reserved its order on the plea by SIT, where the probe agency had argued that the trial court order granting anticipatory bail to Kumar was “perverse” and it ignored overwhelming circumstances against Kumar.
 
 The Congress leader was   anticipatory bail by a trial court on December 21, 2016 in two cases of killing of three Sikhs during the riots, which had occurred after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He had told court his name never figured earlier and it is a case of fresh allegations coming up after 32 years. There two cases filed against Kumar fall in the jurisdictions of Janakpuri and Vikaspuri police stations in West Delhi.
 
 The complaint in Janakpuri relates to the killing of Sohan Singh and his son-in-law Avtar Singh, on November 1, 1984, and in the other Gurcharan Singh was set on fire on November 2, 1984 in the jurisdiction of Vikaspuri Police Station.
