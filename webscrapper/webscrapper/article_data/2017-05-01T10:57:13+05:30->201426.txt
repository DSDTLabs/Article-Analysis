HYDERABAD: Diversion of PDS rice by road became difficult with the introduction of GPS tracking system which were installed on the supply vehicles. The movements of these vehicles are monitored on a regular basis from the central command control centre in Civil Supplies Bhavan here. But now, some unscrupulous elements have taken to the rail route to divert the subsidy rice to the open market in neighbouring states. 

 The enforcement teams have caught at least five gangs trying to divert the rice through trains in April. Tip offs revealed the gangs were attempting to take the rice in other bags (not PDS gunny bags).
 
  Interrogation and preliminary investigation into this   of diversion through rail revealed the modus operandi of the gangs. Officials said these gangs are buying rice from the consumers directly at Rs 6 to Rs 8 per kg and were taking them to Maharashtra where they would sell it in the open market for Rs18 per kg to Rs 21 per kg. 
 
 In some cases, gangs admitted that they exchange rice for wheat in Maharashtra. This rice is also finding its way to   and other states through trains, and also by road. Officials said every effort is being made to check this as this PDS rice is also being exported to African countries from the   in Andhra Pradesh.
 
  Officials admitted that that there are thousands of white card holders in Greater Hyderabad and other districts who are above poverty line. They are taking their quota of rice from Fair Price Shops every month to keep the white card in continuation and avail government benefits and other schemes. 
 
 “These people are selling the rice to gangs. As identification of such above   holders is not possible without the involvement of Fair Price Shop dealers, the enforcement teams are now probing the role of   No one will be spared,” said officials.
 
  “The diversion has come down to a large extent but lot more needs to be checked,” Civil Supplies Commissioner C V Anand said.
