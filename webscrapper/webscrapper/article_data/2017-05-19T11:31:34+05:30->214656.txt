COIMBATORE: Chief minister Edappadi K   on Wednesday unveiled the plans to desilt the Mettur dam in   and said his government has set aside Rs 100 crore for the restoration of water bodies across the state.

 “The drought has affected several people this year. To address the issue, we want to store rainwater to the maximum. We have allocated Rs 100 crore for restoration of 1,519 water bodies across the state. The work on desilting Mettur dam will begin in a week,“ Palaniswami told the media at the Coimbatore airport on Thursday.
 
 The state government had ordered desilting of five major reservoirs in August 2015, but the work had been pending since then. Last year, water conservation activists had taken out protests demanding desilting of Mettur dam. There are no records to verify when the Mettur dam was desilted last.

 Citing the plight of farmers of the state, Palaniswami said the   government has been taking steps to help them.“The government is trying to help the farmers obtain crop insurance. It will be valued at anywhere between Rs 6,000 and Rs 7,000 crores.“ The state government would also provide a solatium to the affected farmers, he added.
 
 On Thursday morning, the chief minister held a video conferencing with seven district collectors. “I have asked them to speed up work on potable water projects,“ Palaniswami said.
 
 The state government has also instructed officials to identify farmers left out from the list for the solatium. “I have directed d the officials to identify eligible farmers left out during the identification process,“ he said.
