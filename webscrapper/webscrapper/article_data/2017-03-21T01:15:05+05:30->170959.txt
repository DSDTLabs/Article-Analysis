NAVI MUMBAI: Demolition squads deployed by   and   faced stiff resistance from locals in   after they began razing an   under-construction four-storey  . 

  Around 60 protesters managed to halt the drive for over two hours after which cops were deployed. 
 
 The developers of the building, Vinod Madhavi and Arun Kumbar, had argued that the construction was not illegal. “NMMC has never issued a commencement certificate and an occupation certificate to this building. It’s being built without required permissions,” said deputy civic chief Amrish Patnigere. 
 
 The developers were served eviction notices under the MRTP Act but they ignored the warnings, said officials.
 
 Two more structures were also razed up to the plinth level on Monday. A total area of 305 sq m was cleared of encroachments in the drive.
