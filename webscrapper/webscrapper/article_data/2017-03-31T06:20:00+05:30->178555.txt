Kolkata: The atmosphere at Jadavpur University’s School of Women’s Studies remains tense over the fate of its contractual staffers and the School itself. The   ( ) had sanctioned and funded this School on a plan-to-plan basis that was reviewed every five years.

 Ten employees had pressed the panic button as their appointments were supposed to lapse by the end of the XII Plan period (March 31). Though a recent UGC notice has given a one-year relief to these ten employees, they are worried about the rider that says the scheme itself will be reviewed by the UGC.
 
 Founded in January 1988 by professor Yasodhara Bagchi, the School was recognised by the UGC in February 1989. Currently, it has 10 contractual and six permanent staffers. If the contracts of 10 staffers get renewed only by a year, many feel it automatically makes the School’s future uncertain as well.
 
 Tension mounted recently after reports stating, Tata Institute of Social Sciences might have to close its Advanced Centre for Women’s Studies, also sanctioned and funded by UGC.
 
 “The women’s studies programme has been reviewed several times over since it was set up. The guidelines change, every five years. Sometimes, the changes are significant. On other occasions, they are minor,” said Samita Sen, the director of School of Women’s Studies.
 
 However, the five-year plan no longer exists. “People have pressed the panic button because there is little information available about the kind of review that UGC will do about these schemes. Will this be a review of the performance of the centre or the individuals? We hope Women Studies Centres that have contributed richly to both intellectual and policy frameworks will continue to receive support from the UGC,” Sen said.
