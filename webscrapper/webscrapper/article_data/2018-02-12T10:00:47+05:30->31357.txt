HYDERABAD: Despite several campaigns, healthcare experts say more public awareness is required to eliminate the stigma associated with menstruation in urban and rural areas in Telangana. 

 According to a survey conducted by  , a New Delhi-based organisation, over 57% of women in Hyderabad have borrowed a sanitary pad from a friend, colleague or family member at some point.
 
 Releasing the findings, Everteen, a brand of feminine hygiene products, said nearly 43% women in Hyderabad feel uncomfortable buying sanitary pads in front of other customers at the store or while talking about it with strangers. The statistics also show that nearly 85% women prefer sanitary pads being delivered at their doorstep.
 
 A 2017 study conducted by the Centre for World Solidarity (CWS), found that menstrual hygiene is still a grossly neglected subject across all 21 districts of Telangana.
 
 The latest   Survey 2015-16 also revealed that AP and Telangana do not feature among the seven states in India where 90% or more women in 15-24 age group use hygienic protection during menstruation, say healthcare experts.
 
 Dr  , medical director of   and a leading gynaecologist and IVF Specialist in New Delhi, said, "Provisioning sanitary pads is a monthly agony for most women, irrespective of whether they are homemakers, working professionals or students. As many as 24% teenagers in India skip school every month due to period pain."
 
 "The social stigma has a direct impact on a woman's intimate hygiene. We also come across patients who have persistent infections because of not using the right sanitary products. Widespread public awareness and innovative solutions are required to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat in the context of women. By focusing on complete feminine hygiene, India can save a lot in healthcare costs through prevention," she added.
