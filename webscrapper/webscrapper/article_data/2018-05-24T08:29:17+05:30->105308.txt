NAGPUR: Municipal commissioner Virendra Singh has suspended five   Corporation (NMC) staffers for not reaching their workplace on time. They include Manoj Singh (deputy engineer, Dhantoli zone), MG Bhoyar (water works employee, Dharampeth zone), AS Sheikh (working in lighting department, Dharampeth zone), Nitin Zade (employee of public works department, Dharampeth zone) and Anil Nimborkar (mason of public works department, Dharampeth zone).

 Singh and additional municipal commissioner   paid a surprise visit to Dhantoli and Dharampeth zones on Wednesday morning. The zone offices open at 10am and all employees are expected to be on their desk at 10am sharp. However, many employees habitually reach office quite late.
 
 “Singh reached Dhantoli zone office at 10am. As employees had no idea of his visit they were in a state of panic. On entering the office, Singh ordered the main door closed. He then interacted with the staffers and asked them about the problems faced by them and citizens in their working. As Manoj Singh was not on his desk, the commissioner was furious and ordered the assistant commissioner of Dhantoli to suspended him. The civic chief also directed that a list of employees not inside the office be prepared and a proposal be sent to the head office for deduction of their salaries,” a NMC official said.
 
 Singh also directed the NMC administration to install biometric attendance system in all civic offices. He made it clear that employees reaching late would be suspended in future.
 
 After this, Singh proceeded to Dharampeth zone at 10.15am and ordered the suspension of four employees for not remaining present at their desks on time.
