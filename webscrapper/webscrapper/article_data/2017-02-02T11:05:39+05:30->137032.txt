MUMBAI: Even as they appointed Delhi boy,  , to lead the India U-19 team for the two 'Youth Tests' against England in Nagpur later this month, the junior selectors sprang a surprise by leaving out talented batsman Prithvi   from the team.

 Though Shaw has only managed 9 and 12 against England in the on-going one-day series at Mumbai, the 17-yearold had last month kick-started his First Class career on a sound note, slamming a match-winning 120 against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy semis before cracking 71 & 44 in the final.
 
 "No one has been dropped in this age group. We're giving opportunities to a lot of boys who deserve it and have done well.   is very much in our scheme of things. We've noticed his performances in the Ranji Trophy. The present set of players whom we've picked for the 'Tests' are those who aren't available next year (due to age issues), and have done well in junior cricket.
 
 "We want to keep their hopes and enthusiasm alive to enable them to take their cricket further," former India seamer and current U-19 chief selector  , told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 Most of the players in this team may fail to make it to the U-19 One day World Cup in New Zealand next year as they would cross their age cut-off date by then.
