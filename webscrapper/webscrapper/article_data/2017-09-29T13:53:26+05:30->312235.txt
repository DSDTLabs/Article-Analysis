Amidst huge fanfare   and   starrer ‘Mahanubhavudu’ has finally hit screens on September 29. Directed by   the film also has  , Nassar, Raghu Babu in pivotal roles.

 
 
 The movie begins with a man on a stretcher narrating his tale.   (Sharwanand) is a man who suffers from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). He is obsessed with cleanliness and runs a mile away from anyone sick, even if it's his mom or boss. He bumps into Meghana (Mehreen), who's almost as obsessed with cleanliness as he is and falls for her. She's very Swachh Bharat oriented and he cannot help but fall for her. Meghana's father is introduced, played by  , a mud wrestling loving sarpanch. Vennela Kishore is introduced as his funny cousin, Kishore.
 
 The first half of the movie is filled with situational comedy related to the cleanliness, an interesting fight scene, the 'kiss' scene and three exciting songs. The script is fresh with director and writer Maruthi exploring the effects of OCD pretty well. Most of it is spent establishing Sharwanand's character and his love story. The shocking and heartbreaking yet unsurprising twist before the interval is exciting too, making us wonder how effective the second half would be.
