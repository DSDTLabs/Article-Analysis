GUWAHATI: Universities across the state are trying to facilitate digital transactions on campus following a push by the   (UGC). 

  (GU) and   (TU) are already taking fees online. Students of the latter university, a central one, have even launched an awareness drive outside campus to popularize online payment among shopkeepers.
 
 While the universities admitted that poor internet connectivity in the region was a problem, they added that the momentum in favour of a cashless campus was strong. "In our university, all major transactions have gone online. The government's digital push has encouraged us further," said TU registrar  . He added, however, that it was proving to be hard to accept small-value transactions online.
 
 The GU, on the other hand, has introduced smart cards for students to facilitate online payments. Director of students' welfare at GU,  , said the university had activated all such cards. "These cards are going to be immensely helpful for students. They can now make payments without having to stand in a queue for hours," Kakati said.
