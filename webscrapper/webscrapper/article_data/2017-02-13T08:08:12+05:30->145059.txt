NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has asked   to review   — money charged from patients for OPD consultation, lab tests, imaging services and room rentals among others — to meet the institute’s increased non-plan expenditure. 

 V Srinivas, deputy director (administration) of the institute confirmed this to TOI on Sunday. He said   charges have not been reviewed at AIIMS for   now. “The last   took place in 1996. Since then, the institute’s expenditure has grown multifold, especially on salary of staff, travel cost and consumables,” he said.
 
 Sources said that a meeting was held recently in the chairmanship of the institute director to work out services where charges need to be hiked. “The charges for diagnostic tests, for example CT scan or MRI, are nominal. But even that is waived by doctors in nearly 30% to 40% cases. Also, there are some tests that cost only Rs 10 to Rs 25. We are going to scrutinise these costs,” said a senior official.
 
 AIIMS currently generates about Rs 100 crore from user charges. Proposals were made even in the past to make the institute run on a revenue generation model but they failed due to stiff resistance from some faculty members and even political parties.
 
 In 2010, a circular titled ‘study for determination of user charges’ was circulated among faculty members for their opinion. But the exercise was suspended following protests.
