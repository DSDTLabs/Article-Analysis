Even as he’s busy gearing up for the release of his war drama ' ',   has started working on his next production. 
The filmmaker, who had the best success ratio at the box office last year, has signed   to helm his next outing. We hear, he was spellbound by the script written by Nitesh, whose last release created a dangal at the ticket windows. Sajid liked the story so much, he decided to back the project almost instantly. Nitesh, who has been working on the subject for 15 years, couldn’t have asked for anything better. 
 
 In keeping with Sajid’s productions, this film will also be made on a huge scale. While the movie is scheduled to go on floors only next year, the industry is looking forward to what this powerful combination has in store.
