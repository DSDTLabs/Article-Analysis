CHENNAI: DMK working president   on Sunday urged governor   to quash the appointment of   as the   secretary. The process adopted in the appointment was against the ‘rule of law’ and it overlooked existing norms and seniority, Stalin said.

 Expressing anguish and wondering how the governor gave his nod to the appointment, Stalin, in a statement, said the post of secretary to the assembly stands as the symbol of primacy of democracy. The appointment made with scant respect to the roster and against the rules of the legislative assembly has resulted in mental anguish to officers and employees of the assembly, he added.
