With a repertoire of critical and commercial successes like the patriotic thriller ' ', socially-relevant dramas 'Toilet: Ek Prem Katha' and 'Padman', and the recently-released horror-flick ' ', KriArj Entertainment is now gearing up to go on floors with another slate of content-driven films.

 One of their projects will reunite producers   and Arjun N Kapoor with   and Karnesh Sharma’s Clean Slate Films. Says Prernaa, “We saw a high-octane performance by Anushka in 'Pari', which was a risky and experimental film. We will soon collaborate with Karnesh and her again. Our focus is to bring real and unheard of stories to life on the big screen.”
 
 Presently, the production house is busy with the Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor-starrer 'Batti Gul Meter Chalu', directed by Shree Narayan Singh. Their musical-comedy 'Fanne Khan', which features Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anil Kapoor and Rajkummar Rao, has almost wrapped up.
 
 While Prernaa’s film with Vishal Bhardwaj, featuring Deepika Padukone and Irrfan, has been put on hold, she shares, “We are already discussing another project with Vishal. We are keen to collaborate with a visionary like him.”
