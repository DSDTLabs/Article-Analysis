NEW DELHI: Indian Railways’ plan to   the national capital region from trucks by introducing the Roll-on Roll Off (Ro-Ro) scheme may have hit a road bump after pilot runs found that bigger trucks could not be transported in railway wagons owing to the low height of electrical wires and foot over bridges. Due to these technical hurdles, a major load has been shed from the railway wagons, which the scheme aimed to remove from the roads in the first place.

 According to officials, trucks with height of over 3.2 metres were found to be in danger of touching electrical wires in places and even low foot over bridges, causing the   to remove such trucks from the scheme until alternatives are thought of. Officials said this has considerably reduced the number of bookings for the services, however they will continue to ply for smaller trucks and other commercial vehicles.
 
 “There are a few technical constraints to the scheme which the pilot runs have found and we have submitted a detailed report regarding that to the   headquarters for the Railway board. These problems need to be overcome so that we can utilise Ro-Ro to its full potential and leverage it in a positive way,” said Arun Arora, Delhi divisional railway manager. He further added that Ro-Ro has been an environment friendly initiative despite the constraints. “It can address problems of pollution and road congestion. This has paved the way for proliferation of Ro-Ro services pan India wherever such constraints are not there,” said Arora.
 
 The detailed report states the findings of the pilot runs and suggests solutions which include a reduction in the height of railway wagons, an increase in the height of overhead bridges and wires or the introduction of a parallel ring railway line for the Ro-Ro scheme.
