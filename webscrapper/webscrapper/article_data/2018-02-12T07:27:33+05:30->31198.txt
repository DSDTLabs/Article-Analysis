KANNUR: The state government has plans to set up district-level co-operative societies exclusively for   persons.

 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of   here on Sunday, minister for cooperation   said the move for exclusive societies was aimed at elevating the status of the transgender community in the society.
 
 He said the government would release the working grant for the third gender-friendly initiative.
 
 “This is for the first time in the country that co-operative societies are being established for the transgender community and this is expected to help them find self-employment, besides sustaining them financially,” Surendran said.
 
 Nearly 500 transgender people in the state were expected to be part of the initiative, the minister said.
 
 The planned societies would abide by the co-operative law, he said.
 
 Additionally, the government would also form taluk-level   for youngsters. Women would have more than 50% representation in such societies, he said.
 
 On fake gold being pledged in the cooperative banks, the government had directed all gold-loan providing co-operative credit societies to examine the yellow metal pledged with them.
 
 All such cooperative societies should form a four-member inspection team, comprising a director board member, employee and appraiser. The teams, Surendran said, should complete the inspection by March 11. Co-operative department officials, too, would inspect the pledged gold.
 
 Referring to the issue of income tax on primary credit cooperative societies, Surendran said the state government would put pressure on the Centre to restore income tax exemption. Also, since the matter has been before the Supreme Court, the state would urge the centre to instruct the I-T department to postpone tax imposition, he said.
