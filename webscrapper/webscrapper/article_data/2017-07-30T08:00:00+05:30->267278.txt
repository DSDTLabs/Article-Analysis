Elin Hilderbrand’s newest release, 
 , is a fun read full of drama and excitement. It fulfills all the criteria required to become a perfect, light vacation read. Estranged identical sisters, love affairs, betrayal, wild teenagers, fashion, and gossip — the book has it all. Founded on a 
 -like platform, 
  goes beyond just mean girls and plotting against ugly shoes, and establishes a good ol’ delightful tale of friendship and family.

 
 
  will remind the readers of the movie,
 . A story that employs identical twins mostly to have an episode of mistaken identity that acts as a plot twist. Tabitha and Harper, as expected, are commonly mistaken for each other and they end up using it to their advantage. The book also reveals the strong bond shared between sisters, even though a violent sibling rivalry is on the brew.
