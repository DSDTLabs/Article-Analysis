Nagpur: In a strange case, a builder has refused to submit the sanctioned building plan to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for obtaining a fire compliance certificate. Submission of the plan is mandatory for obtaining the certificate. Rai Udyog is building Nagpur Improvement Trust’s (NIT’s) private bus stand cum commercial complex at Jagnade Square on public private partnership (PPP) basis. Builder Kishor Rai had obtained the no objection certificate (NOC) from NMC’s fire department in February 2017. After completing the construction, he applied for the fire compliance certificate on December 21, 2017. However, he did not submit the sanctioned building plan with the application. Chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake dashed off a letter to Rai on December 22 pointing this out. The letter makes it clear that unless the building plan is submitted further action would not be taken. However, Rai instead of submitting the plan, wrote a letter to Uchake on December 30 stating that the project was being executed by NIT and hence NIT had sanctioned the building plan. Rai asked Uchake to look into the matter and forward the file for further process. Commenting on Rai’s decision, Uchake said, “We can’t issue a fire compliance certificate without the sanctioned building plan. We need to know the details of the building as approved by the planning authority. Suppose a person submits an application for fire compliance certificate for a seven-storey building but the planning authority has sanctioned only five floors. We need to know this fact so that we can issue the compliance certificate accordingly.” Rai however, refused to buy this logic. “The project belongs to NIT and hence NMC has no jurisdiction over it. Why should I submit the building plan to NMC? It is just another method to harass entrepreneurs,” he said. Uchake plans to seek the building plan from NIT if Rai does not submit it within some days.
