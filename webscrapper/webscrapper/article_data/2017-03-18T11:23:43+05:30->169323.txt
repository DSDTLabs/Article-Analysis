JAMMU: The strategic   that was closed on Friday evening following landslides in   district, was reopened on Saturday after restoration of one-way traffic, an official said.

 "Traffic will be allowed from Srinagar to  ," the traffic department officials said.
 
 "No vehicle including those belonging to the   or the paramilitary forces will be allowed to move in the opposite direction."
 
 "Restrictions on movement of vehicles have been imposed to ensure smooth passage of one-way traffic as there has been narrowing of the highway at some places due to landslides," the official added.
 
 The closure of the highway that is a lifeline of essential supplies to the landlocked valley, has led to shortages of vegetables, milk, mutton and poultry products here.
 
 Authorities have moved out checking squads to ensure that hoarders and profiteers are prevented from robbing the consumers due to highway blockade by hiking the prices of essentials.
