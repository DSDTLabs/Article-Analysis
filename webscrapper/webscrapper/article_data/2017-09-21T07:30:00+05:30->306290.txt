Chandigarh: Come September 24, Panjab University’s highest governing body, the senate, is going to decide on a recommendation for imposing a “major penalty” — which could also mean dismissial from job — on a professor who has been accused of sexual harassment on four occasions. 

 The senate’s decision will come nearly a week after the professor did not appear before the Panjab University Committee Against Sexual Harassment (PUCASH) on September 18 in connection with the fourth and most recent complaint of sexual harassment against him, as he was on medical leave. 
 
 But that will not be stopping the varsity from taking action against him.
 
 In a meeting on April 30, the PU’s syndicate, which is the second-highest governing body of the varsity, had recommended the “major penalty” against the professor on the basis of a report prepared by PUCASH in connection with previous complaints against him. During the meeting, it was decided that the professor should be terminated, dismissed or demoted from existing posts.
 
 The syndicate had decided to forward the matter to the senate for a final decision, which will be taken in the meeting on September 24. At that time, members of the syndicate had unanimously approved the “major penalty” on the faculty member. In the PUCASH inquiry report, the faculty member was indicted of sexual harassment. 
 
 PUCASH would be calling the professor again over the fourth complaint. Sources at   said it had been alleged in the fourth complaint that the professor entered class in an inebriated condition and misbehaved with a student. 
 
 The first meeting of PUCASH on this complaint was held on April 24, and an email was sent to the complainant to submit her statement to the committee. It was also communicated to the professor that he should appear before PUCASH on May 10. Once the statements were recorded, it was concluded that the faculty member used “sexually coloured abusive language” and pulled the complainant’s hair.
