  : Reacting to the life sentence to Asaram, 80-year-old Aman Singh   who was allegedly kicked by the self-styled godman on February 4, 2013, said: "Bahut acha raha," (It was very good). 

 Dangi had filed a complaint alleging that Asaram had kicked him while he was trying to touch his feet leading to severe back pain. He later moved court on his complaint. The court of Judicial Magistrate of First Class (JMFC)   had ordered police to register a case against Asaram and issued summons on June 19, 2013. 
 
 In September 2014, the high court quashed orders of JMFC after hearing an appeal filed by Asaram's counsel as it found that "no case could be made out against the petitioner". Recalling the incident, Dangi told TOI over phone, "There was a function in Vidisha. When he passed by me, I bent to touch his feet. He moved backward and kicked me hard..." Talking about the verdict, he said, "Bahut acha raha. Apan ko aur kya leno deno, saja mil hi gayo." (It was very good. I do not have anything to do with him now, he has been punished)".
