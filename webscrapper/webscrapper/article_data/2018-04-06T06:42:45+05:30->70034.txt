KOLKATA: IIT-Kharagpur has partnered with   to archive the teaching methodologies of Indian classical music. 

 Explaining the rationale behind the initiative, the lead researcher of the project, Pallab  , said there is no " swaralipi" (notations) in classical music, as a result of which, a particular style, adopted by a maestro, usually always dies with him. 
 
 Every artiste has his unique style, which he passes onto his students, Dasgupta said. "One particular gayaki remains confined to just one ustad (expert) and his disciples. It never gets shared with others." 
 
 "We may also need to look at artificial intelligence techniques to understand different ways to learn the ragas," he said. IIT-Kgp director   said,"The institute has come up with this unique idea using internal resources, but we welcome external funding for this drive too." 
 
 "If something is not done soon, this knowledge may be lost with the passing away of the present generation of musicians,"   said. PTI
