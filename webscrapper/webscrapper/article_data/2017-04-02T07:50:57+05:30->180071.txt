V R Soundararajan, advisor to the market association, said just 180 lorries had come to the market on Saturday compared to the usual 400 lorries.Onions from   and tomatoes from Mulbagal in   were in particularly short supply “There could be a huge shortage of vegetables in the coming days if the strike continues,“ he warned, adding that the state government should hold talks with the truckers and resolve the issue at the earliest.
