BHUBANESWAR: The   (BMC) on Wednesday launched street corner meetings to create awareness on ways to give feedback on the city's cleanliness status for the ongoing   (cleanliness survey). 

 The Centre has extended the citizens' feedback submission date to February 28 from February 12. The state capital is competing among 500 cities, which will be rated after final assessment by the survey team and the citizens' feedback.
 
 On Sunday, a four-member central team of independent observers took inputs from ground zero about the city's sanitation status as part of the final phase of the survey. Last year, the smartest city clinched the top slot for cleanliness in eastern India and received the Swachh Sarvekshan award, but it missed out on the top 10 All-India ranking. Mysore was adjudged the cleanest city in the country, while the national capital fetched the fourth rank last year. 
 
 Of the 2,000 total marks for the contest, the citizens' feedback carries 600 marks. For the feedback to reach the   (MoUD), an app called Swachhata was launched a month ago. But many are not aware of it. Secondly, there is a toll-free number for the citizens to directly give their opinion on the city's sanitation. 
 
 "The street corner meeting aims to get more and more people involved in the feedback drive," said a BMC spokesperson.
 
 Till February 27, fifty street corner meetings will be organized by the communication cell of the BMC. The communication team will organize the meeting at shopping malls, prominent intersections, markets, nearby movie halls, bus stands and railway stations.
