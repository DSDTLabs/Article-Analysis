Trichy: With encroachments being a major hurdle for the Trichy Corporation in implementing the smart city programme, the civic body on Friday evicted as many as 92 encroachments found along the NSB road and Big Bazaar Street near Rockfort. The civic body plans to relocate the traders and hawkers to corporation’s Yanaikulam ground near Singarathope.

 With the smart city covering 7 sqkm area around Rockfort, an iconic identity of the city, the local people have been lamenting the encroachments by traders on NSB Road and Big Bazaar Street. The tenants have been violating the agreement by renting the shops maintained by Trichy Corporation to secondary tenants for a price, officials said.
 
 “Around 56 shops in NSB Road and 36 shops on Big Bazaar Street were evicted on Friday. They had occupied an additional space varying from 100 to 150 sqft apart from the 100 sqft allotted for rent. This had shrunk the usable road space by half, from 30 feet to 15 feet in width,” a corporation official said. 
 
 As the warnings issued by corporation a week ago to voluntarily remove the encroachments were snubbed by the traders, officials with Srirangam zone of Trichy Corporation along with police personnel removed the encroachments. Corporation sources said that they are chalking out plans to propose Yanaikulam ground as an alternative location for traders.
