CUTTACK: Campaigns for the   are in full  , composers, sound recorders and singers in the city have never been as busy. Over 200 artistes have been working overtime to churn out promotional songs for independent candidates and those from different political parties. 

 While some candidates have been banking on   to lure voters, a host of others have commissioned new songs which highlight their achievements.
 
 "For most of the candidates, we use tunes of popular film songs and customise the lyrics according to their requirements. This being the rural polls, candidates prefer Odia film songs to drive home the local connect with rural voters," said lyricist Dilip Jena who has so far received orders from 32 candidates in the poll fray for  .
 
 It is easy to overlook the effort that goes into the music behind the poll madness. "Noisy election songs and fiery slogans have always been an intrinsic part of elections. But a lot of hard work and creativity goes in making these election campaign songs. We hardly get two to three days' time to prepare a package of five songs. Penning down a new song or changing lyrics of an already popular chartbuster within a couple of hours is not easy," said A K Mohanty, another lyricist.
 
 The cost of recording a package of five song ranges between Rs 6,000 and Rs 12,000 depending on the team doing it. "If an established singer like T Shourie sings a song, then he will charge more money than a newcomer," said Jena.
 
 Candidates also feel that a finely crafted election song has a unique impact on voters. "People will not remember our speeches but I have found people being able to instantly recall campaign songs," said Minati Biswal, a zilla parishad candidate.
