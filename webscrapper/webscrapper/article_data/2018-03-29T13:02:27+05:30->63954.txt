PATNA/BHAGALPUR: JD(U) on Wednesday mounted pressure on   to get Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey’s son   surrendered as he was named in the FIR lodged regarding communal clashes in Bhagalpur.

 Referring to Shashwat and making a veiled attack, JD(U)’s general secretary Shyam Rajak said a criminal is neither anyone’s father, nor son. “The government is not at all liberal; we do not make any compromises with regard to enforcement of law. Nitish ji has his own image and way of working. He can go to any extent to ensure good governance,” Rajak told media persons on the premises of legislative assembly.
 
 On Tuesday, JD(U)’s secretary general K C Tyagi had condemned Choubey’s statement that the FIR lodged against his son was a “piece of garbage”. He said mockery of law might adversely impact all the NDA constituents.
 
 RJD also attacked the Nitish government. “Why is Arijit not getting arrested? It seems this government is being run by goons and rioters,” leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, told media persons outside the house.
 
 There were communal clashes in Nathnagar locality at Bhagalpur after Arijit allegedly led a procession to celebrate the first day of ‘Vikarm Samvat’ on March 17. Later, an FIR was lodged against Arijit and eight other BJP functionaries on March 24. Arijit has moved for anticipatory bail.
 
 On Wednesday, a local Bhagalpur court issued arrest warrants against 12 other accused in another FIR lodged on the written complaint by assistant sub-inspector of Nathnagar police station Hareram Choudhary.
