Puratchi Thalapathy   is someone, who is not known for attending award ceremonies, but the ‘Thupparivaalan’ actor surprised everyone by attending an awards function last night, inspite of his busy schedules with   and Producer’s Council. He was there to honour the Indian Women’s cricket team captain  . 

 Talking to the audience Vishal said, “Normally, I don’t prefer attending award functions, but, I attended this only because I had to honour Mithali Raj. I am a fan of her, I admire her determination, hard work and for placing Indian Women’s Cricket on the world map. It was amazing meeting her for the way she has inspired young girls, who aspire to make it bigger in sports in the near future. This is a good memory to relish for life.”
