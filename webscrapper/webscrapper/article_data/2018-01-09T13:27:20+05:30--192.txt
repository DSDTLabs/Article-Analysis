MADURAI: India has got the highest enrolment in higher education at present with 70 million and is set to grow further and retain at least for the next 20 years, said chairman of   Karumuttu T Kannan. “There is a big challenge before the government and institutions since many of them are first-time college-goers. They should be taught English and there is a responsibility of creating opportunity.” he said.

 He addressed faculty and scholars from various engineering colleges in India and abroad during the inauguration of an international conference on transformations in engineering education.
 
 When teachers enter the classroom they should have an element of sacrifice, but it has been lost by the Indian education system.   suggested the aspect of sacrifice needs to be picked up from the old system - gurukula. India has created great infrastructure in the education sector, but somewhere got the model wrong. 
 
 “Thiagarajar College of Engineering is focusing on various aspects like research and innovation in teaching. The college has state-of-the-art lab facilities including a few which have been created in partnership with industries, he said. 
 
 Secretary general of International Federation for Engineering Education Societies ( )   said that in a globalised world there is an increased need of interrelated work. Global competence for engineering graduates should be a key qualification. 
 
 Fundamental dynamics of globalisation should also be included in the engineering curricula. Genuine commitment is the need of the hour among all stake holders in engineering education throughout the world. He wished to see students from various countries in the world to work together.
