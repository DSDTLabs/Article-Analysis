PANAJI: The two-day Goa Common Entrance Test ( ) will begin from Tuesday for the 4,168 students registered for it. The test will be held across 15 centres.

  This year, however, the number of students answering the test is lower by around 1,200, as compared to 2017, since for the first time, the biology   has been dropped from GCET.
 
 Navelim is the largest centre for GCET this year with 628 students answering from there. The Mapusa centre, which will have 500 students answering , is the second largest.
 
 The GCET is restricted to students aspiring for seats to engineering and pharmacy degrees in Goa and is conducted for the subjects of physics, chemistry and mathematics. 
 
 In 2018, students, who want to join the medicine, dentistry, homeopathy and ayurveda degree courses and the nursing or allied health degree programme in Goa have all answered the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), conducted on May 6 by the CBSE. 
 
 “Mobile phones, calculators and other electronic gadgets are not permitted inside the examination hall. But, unlike at NEET, here students are not frisked as no two students seated next to each other have the same question paper, thus reducing the scope for cheating. Not a single case of cheating has occurred at GCET during the last ten years,” said an official.
 
 There are four series of question papers. The papers are distributed in such a manner that no student will have another answering the same set of questions sitting around him in the examination hall.
 
 There are two centre representatives appointed for every exam centre. There are senior professors from one of the professional degree colleges in the state. These centre representatives transport the question papers to and out of the examination hall. Each centre will also have one centre observer and one presiding officer.
 
 The GCET is conducted by the directorate of technical education which is assisted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
