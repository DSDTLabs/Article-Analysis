GHAZIABAD: Even as work on the 9.3km six lane UP Gate to   is on in full swing, the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) is gearing up for the most challenging part — construction of the section of elevated road which would go over   (ROB).

 “We are already in talks with the railways and have submitted our design, so that the railways could decide in which part the elevated road could be built,” said Chakresh Jain, executive engineer, GDA. “In return, railways has demanded Rs 12.50 crore as supervision charge which entails laying of electrical lines,” Jain said, adding that in a week’s time the amount would be handed over to the railways.
 
 This part of the construction work is critical as rail traffic from Vasundhara ROB is heavy at all times of the day and diversion of traffic would be needed during the construction. “It is one challenge that the railways and the GDA would have to address to meet the June 2017 deadline,” Jain said.
 
 According to the GDA design, the elevated road section over the ROB will be 20 metres above the ground as against the normal 8 metres. 
 
 “When the road is at a height of 20 metres from the ground, with the ROB being nine metres from the ground level, it will ensure that train movement remains unaffected. That is an engineering challenge and we are happy that we receiving full cooperation from the railways,” Jain said.
 
 Being built at a cost of Rs 1,147.6 crore, the project is touted as the country’s longest elevated road to be built on a single pier. 
 
 Once complete it would reduce the travel time from Raj Nagar to UP Gate considerably from the existing 40 minutes.
