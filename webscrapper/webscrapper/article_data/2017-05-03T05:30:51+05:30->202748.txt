THANE: A   constable who has been on the run after allegedly trying to run over his friend-turned-foe in Thane on April 21, shared an "intimate relationship" with the other man, said police sources. Their friendship had soured recently. 

 A probe by the has revealed that the motive behind the alleged murderous attack by constable Ramesh Awate on Atul Pethe (31) was "personal grudge, not a dispute over money", said a police source.
 
 Awate was captured on street cameras, driving his car into a sweet shop in Panchpakhadi area where Pethe was standing. 
 
 Senior inspector Anil Pophale of Naupada police station said that minutes earlier, Awatehad barged out of the shop, hurling abuses at Pethe. "Awate then drove the car towards Pethe who jumped on the bonnet. He was dragged a distance, but jumped aside and was saved."
 
 Nearly 10 days after the incident, the police said that they are unaware of Awte's whereabouts, but expressed suspicion that he could be hiding in his hometown at Jejuri in Pune district.
 
 Senior police officials said that they are seeking legal opinion in the case. "Suitable action will be taken against the accused and he shall not be spared if he is found guilty," said city police commissioner Param Bir Singh.
 
 Pethe said that he had come in contact with Awate through family friends around eight months back and the two were even connected on social a networking site. Awate had borrowed Rs 3 lakh from Pethe's mother but did not return it.
 
 Pethe said Awate had often tried to bully him. "I will definitely fight him. I have evidence against him which has already been forwarded to relevant government agencies for action," Pethe told TOI.
