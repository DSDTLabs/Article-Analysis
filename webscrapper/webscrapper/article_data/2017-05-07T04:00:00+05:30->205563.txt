AHMEDABAD: Discrepancies in the prescription on the first and last pages of   books led to the bust of scam, where   were produced in court so prisoners could get bail. Crime branch sources said in some OPD books even the hospital stamps were found to be missing. This led the   high court to order an internal vigilance cell inquiry.

 “The inquiry revealed that of 97 such cases, in 73 cases the fake medical certificates were from VS Hospital and the 24 remaining had certificates from the   and Research Centre,” said a senior crime branch official.
 
 Crime branch sources said they have registered an FIR amd sought inquiry papers related to these 97 such instances.
 
 “We will identify the beneficiaries of the scam and the the hospital officials who aided the scam. We suspect that more names could tumble,” said a crime branch official.
 
 Crime branch sources said the inquiry by the vigilance cell of Gujarat high court revealed that several accused had obtained bail more than thrice using these fake certificates.
 
 Crime branch sources said once the scope of the probe is expanded they will question those who allegedly obtained bails using fake medical papers.
 
 “We don’t rule out an inside hand in preparing these fake papers. We have formed teams to probe the role of hospitals from where such fake papers were issued,” added a crime branch source. Earlier this week, Gujarat high court had ordered Ahmedabad city crime branch to probe the scam, where in 97 instances, fake OPD books and case papers were presented while applying for bail.
