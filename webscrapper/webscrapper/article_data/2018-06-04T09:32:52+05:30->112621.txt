GUWAHATI:   Real Estate and Infrastructure Developers Association (Areida) on Sunday requested the state government to intervene into the problem of acute scarcity and unabated price rise of   and stone chips. The real estate body said they have been suffering huge losses for the last few years. The prices have shot up by 30% since December 2017, Areida office-bearers said. 

 "Sand and stone chips which used to cost Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,500 per cm (cubic metre) is now selling at Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,800 respectively. The quantities available even at these inflated prices are grossly insufficient and a large number of projects have been stalled and workers are being laid off en masse," Areida president PK Sharma said here on Sunday. 
 
 "This sector has otherwise received a boost across India, with as many as 20 different support initiatives notified by the central government, including the Prime Minister's flagship programme   (PMAY) and the earnest endeavour of the government to provide affordable housing to all by 2022. Unfortunately, while other states have made significant progress taking advantage of the government's liberal policies, we in Assam have languished," Sharma said. 
 
 The crisis of construction materials first hit the industry in April 2017, real estate developers said, adding that there has been no respite since then. "Small quantities of chips and sand have been trickling in but at highly inflated prices," Sharma said.
 
 While the prices of apartments have shot up by 30% over the last year due to the crisis, many houses have remained unsold.
