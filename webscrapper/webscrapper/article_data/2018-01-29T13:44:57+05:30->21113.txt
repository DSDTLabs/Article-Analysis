 Britney Spears has added extra dates to her final   tour due to phenomenal demand from the fans. 

 The singer announced that she will be performing extra shows in   on July 20 and a second London gig at The O2 arena on August 25 after tickets sold out in seconds. 
 
  
  
 Spears, 36, had earlier said she was bringing her 'Piece of Me' tour to the UK and Ireland, after her four year Las Vegas residency ended on New Year's Eve. 
 
 However, the London and Brighton dates sold out in seconds when they went on sale, leaving many fans disappointed. 
 
 Britney will commence the tour at the MGM   in Washington DC on July 12 and will wrap it in the British capital.
