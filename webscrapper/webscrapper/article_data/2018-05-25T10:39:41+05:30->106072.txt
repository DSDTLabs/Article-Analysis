ALAPPUZHA: Campaigning in   has picked up pace and on Thursday evening, chief minister   turned up the heat on   while campaigning for Saji Cherian, the   candidate. 

 
 Vijayan said that BJP was plotting to destroy all constitutional institutions in the country and BJP-RSS combine will stand in the way of development in the country. "NDA government is not ready to even allow a discussion on the no-confidence motion in Parliament. BJP is trying its best to destroy democratic principles and secular fabric of the country by even controlling the apex court," he said.
 
 The chief minister came down heavily on senior   leader A K Antony, who had launched a scathing attack on CPM while campaigning for UDF candidate D Vijayakumar in Chengannur on Wednesday.
 
 "Antony claimed that CPM is not capable of fighting BJP. But, it is Congress, which has lost all its political clout, power and energy. After the elections in Karnataka, Congress was forced to sit back and seek JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy's help to form the government. Congress is unsure of the stand of its MLAs and is keeping them locked away fearing BJP," he said.
 
 The chief minister said that when Kerala is being appreciated for its development and achievements, a jealous Antony is levelling baseless allegations.
 
 "Antony is panicking when Kerala is successfully executing various developmental projects and it is being appreciated by the NDA government. Kerala is staging splendid performance in all fields like health, law and order, elderly people's well-being and public education than other states. But Antony is disturbed by all these achievements of the state. Kerala could bag all the achievements under LDF regime and UDF government cannot even dream of attaining these," he said.
