INDORE: In its bid to smooth traffic at the busy   (BRTS), a joint team of officials from the   and   accompanied by a   on Thursday removed encroachments from alongside the corridor.

 The team, led by sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sandip Soni, started the drive from Navlakha square around 2pm. “The drive was launched to remove all hurdles and encroachments at BRTS to facilitate smooth traffic,” Soni told TOI.
 
 The team removed about 20 kiosks erected illegally near Navlakha petrol pump that were posing an inconvenience to people passing the area. The removal of encroachments paved the way to improve the left turn at the square.
 
 The drive then advanced towards Bhanwarkuan square, removing handcarts and kiosks erected on both sides of the corridor.
 
 The team intensified the drive on a stretch between Bhanwarkuan square and Rajiv Gandhi Circle where sheds, that were erected by some restaurants and had placed chairs and tables on the road, were demolished.
 
 The team also seized garbage containers and big swings kept on the roadside by a manufacturer for selling. Meanwhile, traffic cops issued challans to a car service centre for parking vehicles on the service road. The service centre owner signed an agreement that he would not repeat the violation in future.
 
 “During the drive, we removed about 25 kiosks, 30 sheds, 25 counters and other structures illegally erected by encroaching upon the footpath at both sides of the corridor” said IMC deputy commissioner, Mahendra Singh Chouhan.
 
 He added that about 10 trucks loaded with material seized during the drive was sent to IMC headquarters.
 
 “During the drive, the team had to deal with encroachers’ resentment including a large number of women. Due to the presence of heavy police force, there was no untoward situation,” Chouhan said.
 
 He added a similar drive would be launched soon to free the remaining part of BRTS of encroachments.
