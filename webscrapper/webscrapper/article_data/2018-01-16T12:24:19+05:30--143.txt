RANCHI:   on Monday accused the   administration of providing him with very little time to meet his father and   (RJD) supremo   on Monday. "The administration kept us waiting and wasted our time for some reason or the other. I was hardly given three to five minutes to talk to my father," he said.

 Tejashwi, who arrived in the city on Sunday, visited the jail campus at around 11 am and left at 11:50 am on Monday. It was his first visit to the jail ever since Lalu was convicted in the fodder scam case related to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 89 lakh from the Deoghar treasury.
 
 "When we visited the jail after applying for the same, a lot of time was spent in fulfilling formalities, including taking our photographs. We were later informed that Lalu has to appear before the CBI court via video conferencing in another fodder scam case. We hardly got any time to talk to him," Tejashwi said.
 
 The RJD leader said his family was worried his father's health. He claimed that Lalu is patient of diabetes, blood pressure and had also undergone a heart surgery. "We wanted to know if he was taking his medicines on time," he said.
 
 Tejashwi said his father was saddened over the demise of former Union minister and RJD leader  , with whom he spent considerable time in politics. He added that his father was aware of the attack on   chief minister  's cavalcade but refused to comment on the incident.
 
 On RJD's future plans, Tejashwi said efforts are underway to strengthen unity within party members.
