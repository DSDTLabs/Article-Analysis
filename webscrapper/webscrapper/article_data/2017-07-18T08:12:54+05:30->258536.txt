JAIPUR: Union minister Nitin Gadkari during his recent visit to Rajasthan mentioned about poor   engineering in the country. This is quite evident in the state capital as roads constructed just one-and-a-half years ago between   (along the   corridor) is in bad shape. 

 This stretch has become accident prone for motorists due to road rutting and driving on this uneven road, alongside the heavy vehicles, has become risky for small vehicle owners. Residents even complain that many school and colleges are falling on the route and lackadaisical approach of development authority can invite accidents. 
 
 Prithvi Raj Singh, who travels on this road everyday on motorbike says, “There are so many colonies on either side of road. Moreover, flow of trucks on this route is high as it connects Ajmer and Delhi road via B2 bypass. The levelling of road should be done every year as poor condition of road is putting lives of many residents at risk,” he added. 
 
 However, JDA engineers claimed that the milling work has been completed and road is levelled. “The traffic on road is three times than its capacity. This is the reason why the road was damaged. Road cutting is often witnessed on national highways, where movement of heavy trucks is frequent. Acting on the complaint will take time,” said a JDA engineer. 
 
 However, residents alleged that there are many patches where road is uneven and many incidents of motorist falling in past six months have increased. Also, civic body is misusing public funds to repair newly constructed roads. 
 
 According to official sources, the complaint was registered on chief minister’s portal and following this Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) engineers repaired the road. However, no penalty has been imposed on the contractor.
 
 “The contract of this road was signed in 2008. There was no provision of defect liability during that time. But, the road is repaired on the contractor’s cost,” added the engineer.
