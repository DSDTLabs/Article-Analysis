VADODARA: Hopes of the hippopotamus pair at the Sayajibaug zoo becoming a family were dashed after a calf was found dead in their enclosure. The calf is believed to be either still born or died within a short while of being born.

 The male hippopotamus Chunnu and female hippopotamus   were brought from the   in Indore in October 2016 and January 2017. 
 
 Officials said the staffers had informed that the pair had mated and Dimpy had conceived. The officials had started taking care after the development and were expecting she would deliver a baby soon.
 
 On Tuesday afternoon, the officials were informed about the possibility of Dimpy having delivered a calf. Officials rushed to the enclosure and checked it. When the calf was not seen outside, the water in the enclosure was emptied. The calf was found dead in the water.
 
 “This can happen with hippopotamuses in captivity when they deliver for the first time. They do not have any experience or exposure of parenting,” said zoo curator  .
 
 The zoo officials are hopeful that the pair will breed and the zoo may see the birth of another calf in about a year. “They are in their prime and can do so easily,” said Patankar.
