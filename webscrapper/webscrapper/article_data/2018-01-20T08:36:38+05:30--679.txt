 Many   workers and leaders, on the condition of anonymity, say the prevailing political situation in Nagaland presents a "golden opportunity" for Congress to bounce back from the wilderness.
 
 "People in Nagaland are fed up with infightings within the NPF and poor governance. Unfortunately, the Congress is organizationally not in a good shape. This is the reason why we will not be able to use the opportunity to turn the situation in our favour. The reality is that we are not a political force any more," a Congress leader said.

The members of the committee include party general secretary CP Joshi, state Congress chief K Therie, Congress in-charge for  , former chief minister KL Chishi, Congress's minority department vice-chairman Anil Thomas, Assam's former minister Pradyut Bordoloi, former Congress legislators I Imkong and Lanpha Konyak.
 
 Congress sources said the committee will look into details for devising its strategy to take on the NPF.
 
 "For all these years, Congress languished organizationally. We do not think in a short duration something will happen that will help the party to bounce back. Anyway we are trying our best to take our party to the electorate to get the mandates so that we can form a stable government," the leader said.
 
 He said people across Nagaland are looking desperately for a change and the Congress would have delivered more effectively had it been organizationally strong. Recently, the Congress appealed to all former Congress workers and leaders to come back to the party's fold and help in reviving the party in this region.
