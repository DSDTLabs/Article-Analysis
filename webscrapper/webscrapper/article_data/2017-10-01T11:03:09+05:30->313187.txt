 The Goa   Association has placed three players under suspension for participating in an unregistered tournament in Chandor on Saturday.
 
  Former India captain   and defender  , both from   Sports Club, besides midfielder Hayden Fernandes from FC Goa’s developmental team have been identified by the   and handed bans.
  
  “Abranches has repeated the offence and might face a year-long ban. Nickson and Hayden will get a minimum of one month ban with a fine. The GFA has evidence in the form of photographs and videos,” GFA general secretary Welvin Menezes said in a statement on Sunday.
  
  The suspensions comes just a day before the Goa Pro League kicks off. All three players were impressive in the AWES Cup played earlier in the season and were pencilled in to play important roles for their clubs.
  
  The GFA had earlier suspended 46 players but let them free after asking them to pay a fine.
