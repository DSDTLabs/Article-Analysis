 actress   said she felt like she had lost her desire to act until she started shooting for her latest movie  .

  
  
 "I just loved turning up to work every day. And I have to say, that's not necessarily always the case. For a few years there, I lost my mojo in what this was about. I love being a mother, I love being a wife. I have a very nice career behind me," Zeta-Jones said.
 
 "If I'm out and in it, I like to be really knee deep in it and invest the time, the energy and creativity and enjoy it. I wasn't seeing any scripts that would even come close to me feeling like that," she added.
 
 Reportedly, she also said to having a lot of 'insecurities' but she tries to teach her daughter to be strong and confident.
 
 She said, "I try to instil in my daughter, and in myself, a sense of strength and power, you stick by your word. But of course there are vulnerabilities. There are insecurities like every woman. 
 
 "I'm a working mother, I have all those insecurities. And I think that coming from where I came from in Wales, it takes a certain kind of resilience to be able to take the knocks and keep battling through."
