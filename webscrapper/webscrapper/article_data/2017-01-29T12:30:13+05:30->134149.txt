SHILLONG: It is the day that the people of the serene northeastern town of   have been waiting 16 years for, to see their local hero - one who has etched her name in the history of Indian boxing -fight before their eyes. Sunday will be a day of reckoning not just for the   capital but also for the whole of India as   will take the ring as the first Indian professional boxer in her IBC Fight Night bout against   of Hungary.

 "Playing in front of the home crowd is going to be a huge thing for me. In my 16year boxing career, I am boxing in an official fight in my hometown for the very first time,"   Devi told TOI over phone on Saturday.
 
 But it is going to be a very different fight for the 2006 amateur world champion. The bout will be longer -the two minute rounds for an amateur woman boxer will be replaced by at least four rounds of three minutes each. Scoring will not just depend on the number of clean punches but the boxers will be given points based on their defence, effective aggression, clean and hard punching and ring generalship. But the most marked difference will be the absence of any head gear in the fight.
 
 While Sarita had earlier acknowledged that "fighting without head gear will be my biggest challenge", her training at SAI Rohtak under veteran coach   -who has mentored the likes of   -looks to have boosted her confidence. For, on the eve of her fight against the World No. 29, Sarita said: "Professional boxing is a different horizon. It is always tougher with the longer rounds and tougher opponents. But I'm well-prepared for the fight!" But she has a tough contender to overcome in her first professional bout. A veteran of 59 bouts, the Hungarian has 19 wins with four knockouts to her credit. She matches her in the ring aggression with aggressive verbals off it.
