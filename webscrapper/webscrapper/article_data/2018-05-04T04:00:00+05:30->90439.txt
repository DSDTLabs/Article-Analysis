Surat: Seven people were booked at Varachha police station on Wednesday for cheating an Ayurvedic doctor,  , of Rs 2.55 crore. The accused offered to give Rs 4.5 crore to the trust but demanded Rs 3 crore cash in return from the doctor for tax benefits.

 Police booked Imran Faruq Hamdani, a resident of New Rander; his son-in-law and chartered accountant Nakib Memon, a resident of Bilimora in Navsari; Vijay Thummar, an Ahmedabad resident; Riyaz Pathan, also an Ahmedabad resident, Harshad, a Varachha resident, Mahesh, also an Ahmedabad resident and Appubhai. The accused were booked for criminal breach of trust, cheating and other Sections of the Indian Penal Code. The complaint was lodged by Akbar Suleman Patel, a resident of New Rander. 
 
 Patel runs a nursing training institute under the Ekta Education Trust and accepts donation on behalf of the trust for which a donor can claim deduction in income tax. Patel was approached by the accused who offered to give donation of Rs 4.5 crore to his trust but only if they got Rs 3 crore cash in return. 
 
 He agreed to give them the money back in cash after accepting Rs 4.5 crore in his bank account through direct bank transfer. The accused took Patel to different places in the city and Ahmedabad where they met different individuals who told Patel that it was safe to do business with the accused.
 
 Patel was convinced and so arranged Rs 2.55 lakh and gave it to the accused and said he will give the remaining Rs 45 lakh soon. Patel handed over the cash only after he was shown a message on mobile phone of one of the accused that Rs 4.5 crore has been transferred to the account of his trust. But when Patel checked, money had not been transferred into the bank account of the trust. The fraud took place between April 18 and April 25 in the city and Ahmedabad.
 
 Patel tried to contact the accused but their phones were switched off. “We have registered the offence and are trying to trace the accused,” police said.
