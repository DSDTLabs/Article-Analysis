AHMEDABAD: It was an ‘audio-visual’ medium chosen by the medieval Rajasthanis to narrate story of Dev Narayan, one of the Bhomias (protectors) of the community — a painted cloth scroll depicting life journey of the hero, accompanied by live performance to narrate the story where the characters come alive from the scroll. 

 
  To mark the International   on May 18, LD Museum has organized an interactive session on the narrative scroll. The museum has a parh (painted cloth scroll) dating back to 1939 which is 32 feet wide and five feet tall and is prepared by  , a traditional parh maker from Bhilwara.
 
 Prof Ratan Parimoo, director of the museum, said that the parh is meticulously restored and framed as an example of crafsmanship and rich heritage of story-telling. India has a long history of story scrolls, dating back to 6th century BC where Buddhist monks used to paint scenes from Jataka tales to take it to the masses.
 
 “These pictorial scrolls narrate the intricately-woven story of three generations of Baghrawat Dev Narayan. The figure of Dev Narayan is painted in centre of the scroll as his life events are painted in a pattern from one end to another. The scroll, having hundreds of images, is considered portable shrine in which backdrop the performance consisting of singing and dancing takes place. In that sense, the scroll is visual equivalent to the gatha but it’s also the deity’s dwelling place,” said Parimoo.
 
 The figure of Dev Narayan is always accompanied by the mythical great serpent Vasuki, identified as ‘Basak Nag’ in the narrative. Like consecration of a deity in a temple, the parh is considered complete when the eye of Dev Narayan and the serpent are painted on the scroll. Painting a scroll also used to be an elaborate ritual from choosing a good date and time to handing it over to bhopa (priest) and the first performance on 11th day of the month of Kartik in Pushkar.
