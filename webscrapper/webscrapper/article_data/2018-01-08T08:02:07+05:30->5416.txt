NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Film Certification has handed over U/A certificate to Sanjay Leela’s Bhansali’s controversial film ‘Padmavat’ after the filmmakers showed the final print incorporating the modifications suggested by the panel. Now that the certification process is completed, it is the prerogative of the producer to decide on the date of the film’s release, sources said.

 In its December 28 meeting with the film producers, the review committee of CBFC and a special panel of historians had recommended five modifications to ‘Padmavati’. First, the Board recommended a change in the film’s title to ‘Padmavat’.
 
 CBFC also asked for the inclusion of two disclaimers; one clarifying that the filmmakers do not claim historical accuracy, and a second that says the film does not endorse the practice of Sati and Jauhar. The filmmakers were also asked to modify a song sequence featuring the Mewar queen, played by  .
 
 While this brightens the prospects for an early release of the film, industry sources said uncertainty still prevails over the release date. Apart from the controversy that catapulted Bhansali’s period drama into the limelight, from an industry point-of-view, release of ‘Padmavat’ will be significant for it will be the first Indian feature film to get a simultaneous global release across 60 countries by global studios-Paramount Pictures.
 
 Since the exhibition of a film is a state subject, sources said it is likely that the film will not be released in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the states that have been the nerve centres of the protests against the film.   and the Mewar royals have continued to hold out their protests against the film despite the modifications.
