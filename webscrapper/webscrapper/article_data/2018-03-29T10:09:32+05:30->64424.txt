CHENNAI: River Cooum has become largely free of floating non-biodegradable materials, as   and PWD have placed 'bloom placers' at eight locations. 

 These barriers filter the flow and block movement of waste material dumped in the river. They are effective during the monsoon, as they would allow free flow of water from the downstream towards the upstream before culminating into the sea, say PWD officials.
 
 Accumulation of this non-bio degradable material on water surface will block penetration of sunlight into the water, resulting in poor oxygen levels and increasing the quantity of acidic material in the water. Due to this, gas formation will happen under water, which at times will become even toxic, say experts.
 
 While the PWD is in the process of deepening and desilting the water body, the corporation, on its part, is working on removing encroachments along the bank and put up 'bloom placers' at eight places along the river course. All the floating garbage from the river are cleared periodically and are taken to the   dump yard. 
 
 The first barrier was installed near   off   college in   last year on a trial basis. After its success, barriers were installed in seven other places in the city. The second one was installed on the river near  . Within the next fortnight the work of installing barriers will be completed, said a senior PWD officer.
