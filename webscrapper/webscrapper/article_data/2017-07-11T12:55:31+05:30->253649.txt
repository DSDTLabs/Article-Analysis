 Sridevi was seen rocking the velvet suit like a pro! The lustrous blazer boasted shoulder padding—which was worn over a laced black slip. She worked the wide-legged pants with high heels. For this luxe look, she sported a braided updo and matching colour earrings. And when it came to her make-up, she went for a subtle take with a hint of shimmer on eyes and glossy lips.
