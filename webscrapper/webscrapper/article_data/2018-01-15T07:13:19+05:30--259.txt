PUNE: Police investigators on Sunday night managed to ascertain the identity of the two assailants in the murder of city property developer   (56), who was fired upon in the parking lot of his housing society, 'Sayali', off the plush Prabhat road around 11.15pm on Saturday.

 TOI had reported the incident in its late edition on Sunday.
 
 "A relative of one of the two suspects identified them after watching   footage obtained from the housing society. We will soon arrest them," a senior police officer said.
 
 
  
 
 Shah succumbed to his wounds while taking treatment at a private hospital in Navi Peth. The Deccan police and the crime branch have launched a probe to determine whether there was a possible underworld link to the killing, police sources said. 
 
 Shah, who was shot in front of his 24-year-old son Atit, held vast tracts of land parcels in Mulshi, Paud and   on the western fringes of Pune, which are high in demand. 
 
 The murder shook the otherwise peaceful and tranquil surroundings of Prabhat road and sent a wave of panic among the community of builders and developers in the city.
 
 Additional commissioner of police Ravindra Sengaonkar told TOI that the motive behind Shah's murder is yet to be ascertained. "We have sent out teams to arrest the suspects," he said.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (zone-I)   said the police are probing the case from all angles. "Some teams are working on whether the murder was a fallout of a land dispute as Shah was in the land-dealing business. Other teams are checking for any other reason behind the murder," he said.
