“I am 50 now, I should limit my activity.” A phrase we have all heard from our parents, our relatives and anyone who has crossed the half century mark. But, for  , a biochemist and a former teacher, life at 78 has only become stronger. 

 
 
 In a recent video posted by marathon runner and model  , his mother, Usha, can be seen acing the plank exercise. The 78-year-old is showcasing her fittest best by holding the plank position for 1 minute 20 seconds, a time period difficult for most to hold. The video was posted on mother’s day to serve as an inspiration for those who give up on exercise because of age. 
 
  
  
 Before this, Usha was seen participating in the last leg of The Great India Run, where the marathon lasted for two weeks and also had Milind as a participant. The Great India run was a marathon between Ahemdabad and Mumbai, covering a distance of 570 kms.
 
  
  
 After breaking the stereotype of exercising post 50, Usha went on to knock down another mental block. In both the videos posted by Milind, Usha can be seen leading the exercises in her saree. This not only proves that you don’t need gear to exercise but will to do it, but also proves that it can be done at any age and at any time. 
 
 Milind is also in the process of launching a line of fitness sarees, as he feels that Indian women are not comfortable running in shorts, and hence, a light-fabric saree can do the trick and motivate more women to take the leap.
