PATIALA: The state government is working out modalities to set up special courts inside jails to try gangsters and hardcore criminals, said   cabinet minister for jails   on Wednesday. 

 Randhawa said a special courtroom was already being set up inside the   central   on a pilot basis and the same would be replicated in all other jails across the state. 
 
 He said these courtrooms would help keep the gangsters and hardcore criminals confided within the jail premises and would also address the security concerns that agencies face while producing them before courts.
 
 He said while video conferencing facilities were already available inside jails, the special courts would also take away the opportunity for the gangsters to appear before public in a glorified manner.
 
 Just a day after taking charge, the minister who conducted a surprise inspection of the Patiala jail on Wednesday morning ordered a few proactive measures to overcome various shortcomings inside the jail premises.
 
 Later, he told mediapersons that the department was going to recruit 420 additional staff to overcome the shortage.
