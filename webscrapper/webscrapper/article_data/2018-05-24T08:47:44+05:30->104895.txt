THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As a part of the 127th birth anniversary celebrations of former chief minister of Travancore-Cochin C Kesavan, Kerala governor   released the C   commemorative postage stamp here on Wednesday. 

 
 The first stamp was received by cultural minister A K Balan at a function jointly organized by state cultural department and   Foundation here. 
 
 Speaking on the occasion, governor remembered C Kesavan as an extra ordinary statesman and courageous social reformer who fought against the evils of caste system. He expressed the need to recognize and honour C Kesavan and appreciated the effort by C Kesavan Foundation and postal department in bringing out the commemorative stamp.
 
 “The postage stamp is certainly a fitting homage to the Abstention Movement of 1930s. However, there are many reasons to remember him now. At the time when the state increased the minimum wages of labourers, how can we forget C Kesavan who showed a model by legislating a bill for minimum wages for labourers in 1951,” said P Sathasivam.
 
 In his keynote address, PWD minister G Sudhakaran commemorated C Kesavan as a renaissance leader who played a vital role in uplifting the deprived sections of the society. He also remembered Kesavan’s famous Kozhanjeri Speech.
 
 Sharda Sampath, chief post master general of Kerala; opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala; Subhash T V, director of department of information- public relations; and Hashim Rajan, secretary of C Kesavan Foundation also spoke at the function.
