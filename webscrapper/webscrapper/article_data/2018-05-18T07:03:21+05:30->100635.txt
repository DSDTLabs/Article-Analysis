They have been identified as Vicky Kumar, Vicky Tanti, Amarjeet Kumar, Golu Thathera, Sunny Mallik, Golu Kumar and Prakash Kumar, all in their early 20s,” Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said, adding five crude bombs, four country-made pistols and 14 live cartridges were recovered from the possession of the arrested persons. The SSP said two more criminals, including one Amit Kumar, were yet to be nabbed.
 
 The SSP, however, said none of the prisoner in the bus had links with People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI). Senior police officers had earlier claimed that two of the prisoners were PLFI activists.
 
 “It was Amarjeet who had passed on the bag containing explosives and firearms to Sonu inside the court,” the SSP said.
