GOLD COAST: The Commonwealth Games Federation on Friday suspended the accreditation of Indian athletes   and   for breaching the No Needle Policy.

 
 
 
 The CGF said in a statement that both the athletes are not permitted to participate in the Games with immediate effect. “The accreditation of Rakesh and Irfan was suspended with effect from 9 AM on April 13. Both athletes were removed from the village,” the CGF president Louise Martin said in a statement.
 
 
 
 According to an   Federation of India official, the two athletes have now moved to their friend’s place and are waiting for the Indian Olympic Association to get the flight tickets to return to India.
 
 “The needle was found by the cleaning staff on April 9. We were called for a hearing on April 10,” an AFI official said.
 
 While one used needle was found on the table kept in the middle of the room, the syringe was found during the surprise checks conducted by the Australia Sports Anti-Doping Authority from the bag of Rakesh.
 
 “Both athletes said they don’t know anything about the needle that was found in the cup. Though Rakesh admitted that bag was his property, he denied any knowledge of the syringe that was found in his bag” the official said.
 
 The CGF said the denial of the athletes, who shared Room No. 2 in Apartment 7, denying any knowledge of the needle found in the cup on a table placed between the two beds and the testimony of Rakesh that he has no knowledge of the syringe inside his bag are both unreliable and evasive.
 
 While race walker Irfan had already completed his event, Rakesh had advanced to the final of men’s triple jump though he was expected to pull out after suffering an injury.
 
 This is the second major infringement of the No Needle Policy by the Indian contingent after the boxing team was pulled up for the same offence before the start of the Games.
