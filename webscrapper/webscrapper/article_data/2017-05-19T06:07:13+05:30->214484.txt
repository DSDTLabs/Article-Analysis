SHILLONG: In a bid to crack the whip on   before the  , the ruling   in Meghalaya has said no one is above the party. 

 Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president DD Lapang has admitted to receiving a petition from the   against power minister Sniawbhalang Dhar for allegedly trying to set up a candidate against deputy chief minister RC Laloo.
 
 "Yes, it's a fact that Jaintia Hills BCC has sent me a letter. But I am yet to go through it," Lapang told reporters at the Congress Bhavan here on Wednesday. He said he was awaiting a detailed report from the   based on which action would be initiated.
 
 The infighting in Meghalaya Congress has come to the open with ministers and legislators denouncing party colleagues. In some cases, leaders are even flagging names of rival candidates against party members. Lahkmen Rymbui, president of West Jaintia Hills Congress Committee, said, "The Jowai BCC has lodged a complaint against Snawbhalang Dhar for his anti-party activities. As per reports, he wants to set up a candidate against RC Laloo, the deputy chief minister. This is against party rules and regulations". 
 
 The Jaintia Hills region is a Congress stronghold and has elected the party for 5 terms. The block and district-level committees have also urged the party top brass to put a stop to such blatant anti-party activities before the assembly polls.
 
 The state is scheduled to go to the polls early next year and there are speculation that many sitting Congress MLAs could switch sides before the elections. Lapang said, "I don t believe it because rumours spread through newspapers which cannot be taken as the gospel of truth". 
 
 The veteran leader said sitting legislators would be given priority while distributing party tickets.
