NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday pulled up   authorities over their failure to start an internal probe against a professor accused of sexual harassment. Professor   has been named in eight FIRs. 

  "What about providing an environment that is safe (for students)? He (professor) is a warden and some students in the hostel have said they feel unsafe. Is the vice-chancellor so helpless that beyond an internal complaint committee ( ), he can't act? He is the head of an educational institution," Justice   asked the counsel of the university when she claimed the administration could do little since students have not lodged a complaint with the committee. The court was hearing a petition by women students who are seeking Johri's suspension and want his entry barred. 
 
 The petition has sought that a safe working environment be provided to students. "Would it not be advisable to tell the professor to stay out of the campus till the inquiry is completed? You can treat the representations as complaints. Core issue is that the students should feel safe in the campus. I am not saying you completely trash the professor.   his defence, give him a preliminary hearing. Do something, you can't expose your students like this," the bench said.
