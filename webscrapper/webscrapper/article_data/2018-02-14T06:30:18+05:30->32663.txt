Keeping in mind the role of   in maintaining   and  , the   (FSI) has for the first time assessed the status of water bodies near forests and found that the extent of such sources of water, lying inside or within one km from the perimeter of forested areas, increased over the past decade.

  (432 sq km), Gujarat (428 sq km) and Madhya Pradesh (389 sq km) figured as the top three states reporting maximum increase in size of such water bodies during the period. Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, showed a shrinkage of 202 sq km.
 
 Sharing the details in its India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2017, the FSI noted that there was an increase of 2,647 sq km in the extent of such water bodies across the country over the decade (2005-15).
 
 Reflecting the overall health of ecosystem, the increase shows importance of retaining and enhancing forest cover in critical watershed areas (the very premise of the recent Rally For Rivers campaign of the TOI). Union environment minister Harsh Vardhan released the report on Monday.
 
 “We wish that in future, extent and change in forest cover vis-a-vis major river basins in the country should be assessed and reported since forest cover is a key parameter to assess the health of our rivers,” said river conservationist Manoj Misra of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan.
 
 All states and Union Territories, other than UP, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana and Andaman and Nicobar Islands, had either recorded increase or ‘no change’ in terms of extent of their water bodies.
 
 Referring to conservation measures, including under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the report noted that the assessment was “highly imperative” to understand the changes in the water bodies.
