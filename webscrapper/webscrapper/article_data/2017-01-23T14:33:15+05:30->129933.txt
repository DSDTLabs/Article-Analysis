Singer  , who is dating backup dancer Sam Asghari, said that the two first connected over sushi. 

 The 35-year-old pop star opened up about her and Asghari's first meeting on the set of her "Slumber Party" video shoot, reported Hello! magazine.
 
 Discussing their first encounter, Spears shared, "I think we were shooting and we were doing this scene where I was doing the walk scene through the hall to go through the door to go to the bedroom, and we were sitting there and we were waiting together for 20 minutes at a time. 
 
 "So we were basically forced to talk to each other and he has no idea-I mean, he knows my name-but he doesn't know me as a person," the "Toxic" hitmaker said. 
 
 However, the pair ended up bonding over their similar tastes, including sushi. 
 
 "We started talking about sushi and the things we like. (I said) 'We should go to sushi one day... Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's just do this and let's do this'." 
 
 She added, "And he goes, 'Okay, I'll give you my number after the (shoot).' So it wasn't even like a serious thing, it was just one of those things where we were having a conversation to get through the experience, you know?" 
 
 Despite the connection, it was not until several months later that the pair actually went on a date. 
 
 "I kept his number, and it was so weird because it was like five months later that I found his number in my bag. I was like, 'He was really cute. This guy was really cute!' so then I called him. He is just a really fun, funny person," Spears said.
