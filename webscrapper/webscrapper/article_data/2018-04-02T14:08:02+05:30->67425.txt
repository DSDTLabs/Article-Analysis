 PANAJI: The Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital,  , has re-submitted its proposal to the   (MCI), seeking consent to start a doctorate of medicine (DM) in cardiology starting from the academic year 2018-19.
 
 In February, the MCI had turned down GMC’s proposal seeking permission to start DM (cardiology), citing inadequacies. 
 
 It chiefly pointed out that Dr  , whom the college wanted to appoint professor of the department, lacked the three-year experience required for the post.
 
 Health minister   told TOI this week that they have sent a fresh proposal to MCI, along with a compliance report. 
 
 Dr Jagan  , a cardiologist who recently joined the hospital’s cardiology department, has been named professor. 
 
 Rane said Dr Hanumanthu has the requisite experience to be appointed as professor, but that the department will be headed by Dr Naik.
