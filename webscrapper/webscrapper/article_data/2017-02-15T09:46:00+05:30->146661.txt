JAIPUR: All India Kisan Sabha on Tuesday announced that farmers, in the lakhs, would march to Jaipur from across the state on March 2 to protest the hike in electricity tariffs. The government has refused to withdraw the hike, and the farmers union said it would force the government to rethink this decision as it has hit farmers hard. The farmers urged other members of the public too to join the protest in large numbers and urge the government to see reason.

 Since January 16, the All India Kisan Sabha has been holding protests in different parts of the state seeking that the government roll back the hike and offer farmers and other consumers of electricity relief. Large numbers of farmers gathered on different days at Nagaur, Churu, Jhunjunu, Tonk, Hanumangarh and other districts to protest the hike in tariffs. Since the government has stood its ground and refused to roll back the hike, former   and other said on Tuesday that they would force the government to reconsider its decision by conducting a large march to the state capital. 
 
 In September last year, the government announced hike in tariff of up to 12%. In agriculture, the hike was over 5%.
