Central jail authorities here have lodged an offence against an inmate after 25 grams of   was found in his possession.

 The police said that the contraband was found on a convict, Ashish Dominic Wakhle around 4.10pm on Wednesday. An official said that Wakhle had returned from work at the jailâ€™s Chimanbaug farm. 
 
 During the routine frisking of inmates before allowing them into the barracks, 10 small plastic pouches of   were found on Wakhle, who had hidden the contraband in the sole of his footwear.
 
 Wakhale had recently come back from a leave, which increases the chances of him bringing the marijuana from his native place. 
 
 A case has been registered against him under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985.
 
 In December, an intensive check up by the authorities had culled out 30 cellphones.
 
 Spread out over 200 acre, the premises is set up with 24 jammers. Yet, criminals manage to make calls from inside the jail. The authorities have admitted to the jammers not working completely, while the network of many cellphone companies is too strong to block the signals. 
 
 Housing a population of around 2,500 inmates, the police has a tough time keeping a watch on them. In the last two months, substances have either been found with jail inmates or the security guards.
 
 In April last year, a Cidco resident,   (24) was nabbed after he was found handing over 400 gram Ganja to his brother Nagesh, serving a jail term for dacoity.
