Kolkata: The Md Ali Park Puja found itself at the centre of a controversy on Saturday by depicting a doctor as a demon at its pandal. The idol, which sparked off a valiant protest from the city’s medical community, was removed in the evening after chief minister   intervened and ordered its eviction from the pandal. 

 Earlier, the organizers had stuck a board on the controversial idol that said the demon was a fake doctor and the organizers meant no disrespect to the medical community. But it failed to pacify several doctors’ bodies that threatened legal action and took to social media to lodge their protest. In the afternoon, the organizers put the idol behind a veil, cutting it out of the view of visitors. The puja will be inaugurated on Sunday.
 
 “We realized that some people did not appreciate it. Our intention was never to hurt anybody,” said  , former MLA and chairman of the Puja committee
 
 While the organizers defended themselves saying they had no intention of insulting the medical community and the idol was meant to highlight the menace of fake doctors, several doctors’ bodies described the move as a dangerous one that could incite further violence against medics.
 
 “Doctors have been assaulted, harassed and insulted enough. Now, this is the last straw. Depicting a doctor as an asura will provoke hatred against them. We demand immediate removal of the idol or we will launch a state-wide agitation,” said Sharadwat Mukhopadhyay of Doctors for Patients. The Service Doctors’  , too, objected to the depiction and asked why the police had allowed it to be installed.
 
  also called for the removal of the idol. Later, however, it issued a statement thanking the organizers for clarifying that the idol depicted a fake doctor and was not a comment against the entire medical community. “This could have been done earlier. But we thank Dinesh Bajaj for doing the needful after speaking to me,” said Shantanu Sen, state secretary, IMA Bengal.
