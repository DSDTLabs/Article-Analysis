MADURAI: The government found itself in a piquant situation before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday with the public prosecutor inadvertently producing its order (GO) pertaining to the conduct of jallikattu last year instead of the new one. This led the court to observe that the jallikattu games held in Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur could be considered illegal.

 Petitions seeking permission to conduct the jallikattu at difference places were filed by M S Raja of Eruthazhuvuthal Padhukaapu Sangam, Srivaikuntam and Jesumani of   in Dindigul district. When they came up for hearing before  , additional advocate general   produced the government order (GO) passed in 2017 for the conduct of the games. At this, the judge asked the public prosecutor why the GO for the previous year was being produced in court as it was valid only for last year and that a fresh GO should have been passed for conducting the games this year. He observed that the games held in Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur could be considered illegal if they had been conducted without a new GO for this year. 
 
 However, the government had passed three fresh GOs on January 12 this year including GO number 14 for the conduct of games in Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur in Madurai district. Apart from this, GO number 15 was for holding the games at Siravayal and Kandipatti in   district and GO number 16 for the games at Arasalaur in   district. The dates of the game in each of these places were also clearly mentioned in the orders. 
 
 The case has been posted for further hearing on Friday. It may be recalled that chief minister Eddapadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam had jointly inaugurated the famous Alanganallur jallikattu on January 16.
