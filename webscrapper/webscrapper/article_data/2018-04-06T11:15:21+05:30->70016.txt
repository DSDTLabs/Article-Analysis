MUMBAI: After the acquittal of his four star clients -  , Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam - in the blackbuck killing case,   hopped on to a 1,000-km flight back to Mumbai to cross-examine a witness for another of his high-profile clients, exmedia honcho Peter Mukerjea, in the Sheena Bora murder case.

  
  
 
 However, he couldn't reach the court in time due to a rally in Mumbai. The 60-year-old lawyer was not  's lawyer in the blackbuck case. Shivade had, for a while, appeared as one of Salman's lawyers in an Arms Act case filed over the same poaching incident where ultimately the Rajasthan high court acquitted him.
 
 He was Salman's trial lawyer in the 2002 Bandra bakery culpable homicide case in which the actor was convicted and given a five-year jail sentence in 2015. Salman was later acquitted by Bombay high court when senior counsel Amit Desai appeared for him.
 
 
 
 
 Shivade, who keeps a low profile and hardly raises his voice while crossexamining witnesses, has cross-examined Salman, too, and three other Bollywood actors, including Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in a MCOCA case of underworld funding of the film, 'Chori Chori Chupke Chupke'. He is currently also defending former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal in a rape case and Lt Col Prasad Purohit in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case.
