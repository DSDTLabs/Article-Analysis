THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Two weeks after he took charge as the chief minister, Pinarayi   had told the employees of   that they should review the practice of file inspection. “The system is focused on how to deny legitimate privileges of people. You should think how to help people while examining the files,” Vijayan told a meeting of secretariat employees on June 8, 2016.

 The departments of general administration and personnel and administrative reforms in the secretariat had initiated some steps to review the file inspection procedures. Revenue department even attempted amendments of procedures to provide a shorter route for files.
 
 
 “Half of the work handled by secretariat employees is unwanted. For example, see the procedures for correcting the name of a candidate in the   book. If he/ she passed examination 10 years or more before the date of application, it needs to be approved by the minister before it reaches the Pareeksha Bhavan. It will delay the process by 30 to 45 days,” said a senior employee of the secretariat. An amendment to empower   secretary to decide on all applications of name change will be introduced soon, he said.
 
 Pinarayi Vijayan and finance minister Thomas Isaac are in favour of bringing reforms in the secretariat. The introduction of   Administrative Service, ignoring the unified opposition of secretariat employees, was one bold step in this regard. The pressure tactics of Kerala secretariat employees association ( ) controlled by the CPM is the major factor that stands in the way of bringing in reforms in the secretariat.
