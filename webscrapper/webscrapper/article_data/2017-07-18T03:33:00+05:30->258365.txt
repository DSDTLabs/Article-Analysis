Panaji: Agriculture minister Vijay Sardesai on Monday said that the government will redraft the agriculture policy with a focus on Goan agriculture products, floriculture, contract farming and community farming. He also said that the government is in touch with companies from Israel and Netherlands to produce new species of orchid which will be recognized as flower from Goa. Speaking to TOI, Sardesai said that the policy will focus on giving good price to local cultivators. “We have to support those hard working farmers in the state, especially the Canacona farmers who work hard,” he said. He also said, “To overcome problems faced by farmers we have to create a brand for agriculture products of the state. We have to give preferential treatment to local vegetables as compared to vegetables procured from Belgaum”. “We have to create a brand so that it benefits local farmers in the state,” Sardesai said and that the brand would be created through advertisements. He also said, “We are a tourist state and starred hotels can buy these products.” “We want to promote organic, bio organic and floriculture in the state,” and further added that Union agriculture minister has a unanimous view that Goa should push for floriculture in the state and that is where we can flourish. “I am talking to Netherland and Israel-based companies, even to the extent of trying to create an orchid from Goa. I want to create a new flower called Goa orchid,” he said. He said that agriculture policy will be finalized within a year time. Sardesai gave an example of a farmer from Canacona who had sold turmeric for just Rs 7 per kg as he did not have place to store the produce, even though it commands a high price in market. “I have directed the horticulture corporation to first buy the local turmeric, so that they get a good price for their products before purchasing from other states,” he said.
