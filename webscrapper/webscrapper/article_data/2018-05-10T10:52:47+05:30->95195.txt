VANARASI: UP minister and Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash   on Wednesday termed the senior alliance partner   as casteist. 

 "Why has the BJP government been very selective while deciding the members for the Secondary Education Selection Board," he asked while talking to reporters at the Circuit House here on Wednesday. 
 
 He alleged that the BJP government had inducted relatives of senior party leaders as members of the board.
 
 "If BJP is not casteist, why do party leaders seek details of the caste of those seeking ticket for general elections and the number of voters of his caste in the parliamentary or assembly area concerned? Through its booth-level organization, the BJP collects the details of voters of each and every area," he claimed."This party collects details of over 80% voters of each booth and gets caste-wise details of every constituency," he added.
 
 However, Rajbhar defended CM Yogi Adityanath for campaigning in Karnataka even as UP was reeling under natural calamity. "The CM can't stop storm as it is a natural disaster. He has left the state after ensuring all necessary arrangements for relief in case of any crisis situation," he said.
