AHMEDABAD: The death of a   youth — allegedly involved in the flesh trade — has become a topic of discussion in   circles of Ahmedabad. The youth was reportedly picked up for questioning by city police about a week ago.

 
 Police sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the man, suspected to be an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant, was picked up from Piplaj. Police officials say his liberty was never contained and he was allowed to go home after questioning. However, the man died later. 
 
 Questions are now being raised in police circles as to whether he died during the interrogation or after he was allowed to go. The police maintain that he died of a cardiac arrest after he was allowed to go.
 
 “City police was inquiring into the case of a Bangladeshi family suspected to have illegally migrated to the city. The papers they showed looked fabricated, prima facie. They were asked to furnish more documents to establish their identities,” said city police commissioner,  . 
 
 “It has been learnt that the man died of a cardiac arrest later. The question of custodial death does not arise since his liberty was never contained,” he added. Sources said that the body of the youth may have been buried at an secluded spot near Narol on the outskirts of the city. According to the sources, the man was picked up by five policemen and taken to an undisclosed location.
