VASCO: A group of around 100 people gheraoed the chief officer (CO) of Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC), Deepali Naik, in her cabin, on Friday. The police had to be summoned to disperse the crowd. Led by   councillor Krishna ‘Daji’ Salkar, the group, mostly comprising women, questioned Naik about the ‘injustice’ meted out to Salkar’s supporters.

 Salkar, who was the major opponent of   MLA Carlos Almeida during the recently held assembly polls, alleged that his supporters were being selectively targeted by the CO. 
 
 Naik told mediapersons that she was only discharging her duty without bias or prejudic. She lodged a complaint of trespass and abuse against Salkar and others, at the Vasco police station.
 
 “While it is the municipality’s job to issue notices pertaining to illegal kiosks and dwellings, why are only my supporters being targetted? I demand that the MMC chief officer be transfered. I will be writing to chief minister  ,” Salkar said.
