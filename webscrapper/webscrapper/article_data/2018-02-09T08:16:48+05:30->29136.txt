SECUNDERABAD: In 20 days, authorities will identify a new tract of land for dumping garbage in the Secunderabad Cantonment limits. 

 Brigadier M D Upadhyay said shifting of the present dumping yard to another place had come up for discussion in the   meeting held on Thursday here and they have set a deadline of 20 days for identifying the new land.
 
 Currently,   authorities are collecting garbage from various areas in Cantonment limits and dumping them near the Mahatma Gandhi community hall in Ward No-VII due to non-availability of open land for the past two-and-half years. 
 
 But ward members and residents of surrounding areas are opposing the   hall and organised several protests.
 
 On Thursday, ward member   walked out from the board meeting in protest against the SCB chief executive officer, SVR Chandra Sekhar and army authorities, protesting against their failure to shift the dumping yard from her ward. 
 
 More than 70 agitators protested, demanding shifting of the dumping yard before police foiled the protest and took them into custody. 
 
 Regarding other issues, the board also passed a resolution about digging two borewells in each ward to overcome water problem. The board passed a resolution of issuing trade licences to 21 traders.
