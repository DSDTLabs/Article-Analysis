NAGPUR: Poets and writers participated in discussions that threw light on the path that brought fame to poets   and Gajanan   at a two-day national-level seminar organized to mark birth centenary of the literary doyens. 

 The panel discussion was organized by Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal in association with Rajkumar Kewalramani Kanya Mahavidyalaya and Binzani Mahila Mahavidyalaya. Divisional commissioner Anoop Kumar inaugurated the programme. 
 
 Lectures, dramas and poems based on the life and work of Trilochan were presented on the first day. Nasir Ahmed Khan, a well-known poet from   who spoke on the topic ‘Trilochan ka Lok Vaibhav’, said, “Trilochan and Muktibodh were true poets who spoke about society. They were people’s poet, their writings always endorsed ideas and thinking of the common people.”
 
 “Trilochan wrote in simple language which had deep meaning. His work, however, was noticed very late by critics. But this never stopped him from creating remarkable poems,” added Khan.
 
 President of the first panel discussion,   said, “Many of writers have praised Trilochan in their writings. Trilochan belonged to a poor farmer family, so most of his writings were based on them. However, he was a progressive writer.”
 
 “Trilochan was influenced by Marxist ideology but he never followed it. He used the Marxist literature and blended it with his own ideas to create one of India’s greatest literatures. Through his poems, he also portrayed the deprived class and wrote to uplift them. He never attached himself with any ideology but his writings had a taste of every ideology,” added Awasthi.
 
  Tripathi from Banaras Hindu University, Ashok Gandhi, Vijay Kevalramani and   were also present for inauguration ceremony. 
 
 The second day of the event had lectures and panel discussions on Muktibodh.
