KOLKATA:   ( ) is evaluating the possibility of replacing   with gas-based ones. The move follows a fire at   (KTPS) after an oil-based transformer burst following an electrical fault. 

 "Gas-based transformers are expensive. So it will take time to replace all the oil-based transformers with these dry ones. But we are trying to ensure that if a transformer is replaced, the new one that is installed is a gas-based one," said a WBPDCL official. 
 
 The intermediate bus transformer that converts 400KV power generated at the power plant to 220KV for evacuation and transmission, had burst on Monday evening, leading to a raging fire that had threatened to spread across the plant. Coming at the onset of a long and gruelling summer when power demand soars, the fire had triggered fears of supply disruption. KTPS that has six units of 210 MW each meets nearly a sixth of the state's power requirement.
