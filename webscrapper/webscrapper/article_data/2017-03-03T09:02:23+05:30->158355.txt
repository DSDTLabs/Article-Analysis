BENGALURU: Shobha S, the 7-year-old  , was on fast at  , praying her father's earnings, which has dipped considerably in the past few days, once again hits a high. Her father,  , has joined his protesting colleagues.

 “My little girl was hungry and I could not even buy a chocolate for her. In the past several days, I have barely made three trips but burnt a lot of fuel to drive from one place to other to get one. I have lost a lot of money on fuel and on penalties. There have been days when I have had no earning,“ says Venkatesh S, the girl's father who drives for Ola and Uber.
 
 Ola   has borrowed money to pay Rs 60,000 tuition fee of his two children. “I admitted my children in a private English medium school last year when my monthly earnings were touching Rs 75,000. I could repay the housing loan too. But in the past six months, my earnings have dropped to about Rs 20,000. How do I repay my home loan, car loan and save enough to pay for their education?“ he says.
 
 With the aggregators aggressively hawking their model, thousands of drivers began seeing their earnings soar but soon their dream soured as income started shrinking. Most of them, who bought their own vehicles and have more than one car, are now struggling to pay the monthly instalments.
 
 Shashi Kumar, 26, a student cum part-time cab driver with Uber, has recently joined an ecommerce logistics company .“Driving a cab after college seemed a perfect idea to earn while studying. First, I started driving a cab for an Uber driver.In six months, I had saved enough to pay the initial deposit and buy a car. That was my biggest mistake,“ he said.
 
 “I have to drive without passengers for about 5km and then the passenger would travel for 2-3km. That's a huge loss. That's why I took up the part-time job of delivering parcels in the cab,“ says Shashi, who has been driving UberPOOL.
