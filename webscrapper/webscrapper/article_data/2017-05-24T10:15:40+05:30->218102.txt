NAGPUR: A book titled ‘Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj ke Sahitya Me Samajik Evam Rashtriya Chetna Ka Swarup’ was released by writer   at   on Tuesday. The book, written by Kamleshwar Dwivedi, a driver working in Nagpur University, is based on his research while obtaining PhD. 

 Addressing the gathering, Kane lauded Dwivedi for choosing the works of Tukadoji Maharaj for his thesis by beating all odds. Kane said, “I have seen Tukadoji Maharaj working for the society. He believed that giving unconditional help to society is real dharma. Tukadoji followed dharma, karma and bhakti yog in his life.” 
 
 Praising the efforts of Dwivedi, Puranchandra Meshram, registrar of NU, said, “Like Kamleshwar, I also started working for the university on daily wage basis. He received PhD but I have not. It shows his dedication towards education.” Kamleshwar will retire from job but the writer inside him will live forever. His book on Tukadoji Maharaj will always be there in the library. Like Kamleshwar, people should see dreams and try to realize them, Meshram added. 
 
 Talking about the similarities in the views of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Tukadoji Maharaj, Meshram said, “The rashtrasant preached those values which are written by Dr Ambedkar in the Preamble to our Constitution.”
 
 Pramod Sharma, head of Hindi department and PhD guide of Dwivedi, said, “There are only two books on the works of Tukadoji Maharaj in Hindi. Many unknown qualities of Tukadoji Maharaj should be brought forward. His thoughts on social work and freedom struggle should be brought in Hindi language too.” 
 
 SP Kane, vice-chancellor of NU, recalled the values Dwivedi practised. “Once my father (Padmakar) collapsed, but Kamleshwar was there to help me. It showed his humane side.”
