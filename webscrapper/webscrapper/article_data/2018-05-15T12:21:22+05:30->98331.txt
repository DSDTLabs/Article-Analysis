MADURAI: The idol wing CID of the   police   two retired officials of the Hindu religious and charitable endowments department in connection with the alleged misappropriation in the making of the lord Murugan idol in   temple in Palani.

 The 200kg controversial idol was made in 2003-2004 in order to replace the Abishekamoorthy Idol (presiding deity), under the pretext that it was damaged.
