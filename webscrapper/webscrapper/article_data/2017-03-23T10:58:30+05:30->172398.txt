Kolhapur: Union railway minister Suresh Prabhu will arrive in the city on Saturday to lay the   stone for the doubling of   rail track, along with other development work.

 The railway ministry had sanctioned the doubling of the rail track in the 2015 Union budget. With a financial provision of Rs 4,670 crore, the track doubling is one of the costliest projects undertaken by the Indian railway. The railway administration has sanctioned Rs 280 crore in the 2017-18 Union budget for doubling of the track. The railway minister will arrive in the city on Saturday to lay the foundation stone of track.
 
 The doubling of the rail track is an important project for western Maharashtra as it will help increase the frequency of trains. Once the work is completed, it will give a great boost to goods transportation.
 
 A railway official said, “The railway minister will lay a foundation of doubling of the   rail track and the road overbridge between the Vishrambag and Madhavnagar rail track. He will inaugurate the electrification work of Pune-Daund rail track through a video conference from Kolhapur.”
 
 Central zonal railway zonal consultant committee member   said, “Doubling is a very important development for western Maharashtra, but the rail stretch between Miraj and Kolhapur was excluded from the project. This stretch should be included in the work. We will submit a petition of demands which will incde a new train to Shirdi, extension of Miraj-Solapur daily express to Kolhapur and modernisation of Kolhapur terminus.”
 
 Member of the Pune divisional railway consultant committee, Vijay Bhosale, said, “The track doubling will boost passenger transportation.   in the western part of the state heavily rely on road transportation. Such projects could reduce the time taken to reach Pune and Mumbai. The double track will also help to transport perishable goods.”
