CHENNAI: At around 3.30 pm on Monday, a fishermen's colony in Kasimedu was buzzing with activity. Men, women and children were outside their houses, waiting to see   (Puratchithalaivi Amma) candidate and senior party leader E Madhusudhanan and former chief minister O Panneerselvam ( ) who started their poll campaign for the April 12   bypoll.

 The kolams in front of many houses were in the shape of two leaves (the popular symbol of the parent party), but most were in the shape of the electric pole, the symbol chosen by the   (Puratchithalaivi Amma) faction.
 
 Surrounded by policemen and party office bearers, Madhusudanan, Panneerselvam, Rajya Sabha MP V Maitreyan, veteran leader C Ponnaiyan and others went around the area in an open-top campaign vehicle. They also got down at several points, and walked around the bylanes meeting people.
 
 Speakers urged people to support Panneerselvam “who was chosen by Amma to be chief minister three times”.
 
 The leaders shook hands with voters, clicked photographs with them, and also blessed and named a named a baby Ramachandran, after AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran ('MGR').
 
 Revathi, 36, and Malarkodi, 38, both homemakers who came out to meet the leaders, said they "support only OPS". "We all voted only for Amma (former CM J Jayalalithaa). Now, we support OPS," Revathi said.
 
 Krishnan, 60, a party worker who lives in the area, however said he “will only support Chinnamma”, adding that the faction he supports “will not distribute cash this election”.
 
 Some like Anandi, a flower seller, are not sure about whom to back. “I don’t know what the new symbols are. I will decide after a few days,” she said.
 
 The AIADMK (Puratchithalaivi Amma) faction is likely to release their manifesto in a day or two.
