3 Gante 30 Dina 30 Second, made under the Brain Share Creations Pvt. Ltd. banner, is not just unique because of its title, but also because of the fact that the two main people backing it share a close friendship of over 25 years. Producer   and director   first worked together in TV serials over 20 years ago, and then went on to form one of the most successful ad agencies in  . 

 “Chandrashekar takes care of the finance and administrative side and I, the creative side. We tasted success through our ad agency, but somewhere, we felt that we had lost our way, because we were passionate about making tele-serials. We wanted to get back on track, and this time, we decided to do that through films,” says Madhusudhan, adding that Chandrashekar is a passionate producer, who is clear about the story, artistes and locations. He, in fact, went above and beyond his role as producer and did all he could to ensure that they make a classy film, says Madhusudhan.
 
 Telling us about his debut in Sandalwood with this film, Chandrashekar says, “The script of   explores love in different angles. Today, everyone interprets love in their own way, and somewhere, it seems like the youth has lost its way. The film explores this and the approach to emotions as well; for e.g., would you want to first get settled in life and then look for love, or look for love and then get settled? It’s a family entertainer and everyone has done a good job. Madhusudhan’s work is such that after watching the film, you can’t tell that it is his first film as director.”
