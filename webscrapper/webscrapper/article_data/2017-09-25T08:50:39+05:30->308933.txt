VIJAYAWADA: Although   chief minister   is keen that even he should not be exempted from the biometric attendance system, a close look at the records show that last week the average presence of employees in all the districts was only 22.52% (with daily attendance of 42,432 people). In the past 30 days, the av erage attendance was only 17.05% (with daily attendance of 33,833).

 Data shows that 1,63,110 employees, including those working in Hyderabad, registered themselves under the biometric attendance system and 1,09,779 employees were found to be active. West Goda vari had the highest number of employees (47,863) registered under the biometric attendance system, followed by Krishna (22,459), Kurnool (16,030),   (11,355), East Godavari (11,086) and Visakhapatnam (10,501). However, when it comes to being active, West Godavari (85.16%), Anantapur (75.54%), Krishna (73%), East Godavari (72%),   (71%) are top performers. Kadapa district employees were least active with just 31.05 %.
 
 The state government is keen that while government employees need not stick to timings, they should be present in office. “As CM said, if they sit in office, they can get good ideas. At least a minimum number of working hours are ensured unlike before. This is what we call technical monitoring of employees instead of surprise checks,“ an official said. Many departments are yet to install the biometric machines and officials are gearing to complete the process.
