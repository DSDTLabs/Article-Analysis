Pune: Former state finance minister and prominent Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader   is the new chief of the party’s Maharashtra unit. 

 His name was announced on Sunday during a state-level party convention. Patil replaces Sunil Tatkare, a senior NCP leader from the Konkan region.
 
 A leader from western Maharashtra and member of the legislative council from Sangli, Patil has taken the NCP’s charge in the state ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.
 
 With Patil’s election, the NCP has selected a representative from western Maharashtra, its bastion. The party had suffered losses in the 2014 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections from this region. Patil’s election is also seen as the leadership’s attempt of revitalising the party in its citadel. The appointment is likely to help in appeasing the Maratha community — a traditional vote bank for the NCP.
 
 “The party can make a comeback in the upcoming elections. The focus should be on building network of party workers at the grassroots level. A war room will be set up to monitor the booth-level workers and their activities,” Patil said while addressing the NCP workers.
 
 He appealed to the NCP members to take up the issue of inflation and price rise to reach out to the masses in days to come. “The ministers in the BJP government are involved in corruption cases. Their deeds should be exposed through the network of the party workers. Each booth should have at least 10 workers. The new system should be in place within four months,” he said.
 
 NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik will be the party vice-president and Hemant Takale has been re-elected the treasurer.
