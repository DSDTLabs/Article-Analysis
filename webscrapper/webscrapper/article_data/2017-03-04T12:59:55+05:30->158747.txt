PATNA: Worried over frequent   for the last three days, Bihar assembly Speaker   on Friday reminded the leaders of legislature parties of the assurances they had given to him at a recent meeting that MLAs would not enter the House holding placards in hands.
 
  “Some members backtracked from the assurance and entered the House holding placards. They also turned the reporters’ table upside down,” Choudhary said at a meeting of the assembly’s press advisory committee here. The Speaker urged the legislators to follow the decisions taken unanimously at the meeting of leaders of legislature parties.
  
  “The last meeting of the leaders of legislature parties, which is usually convened before beginning of a session of the assembly, was held on February 21. The legislature party leaders of all political parties, including ruling JD(U), RJD, Congress and the opposition BJP, attended the meeting which discussed ways to ensure smooth functioning of the House. The leaders unanimously took four decisions – no member will enter the House holding placards in hands; while protesting, no member will turn tables upside down; if in any case, the opposition members have to enter the well of the House, they will not go towards the treasury benches and no member will stage dharna at the main entrance gate of the assembly building, obstructing entrance of the MLAs and others,” the Speaker said.
  
  He said deputy CM  , parliamentary affairs minister Shravan Kumar, finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui, leader of opposition in assembly Prem Kumar, BJP’s chief whip Arun Kumar Sinha, Congress’s Sadanand Singh, CPI-ML’s Mehboob Alam and LJP’s   Sah were present in the meeting.
  
  Choudhary also urged the journalists not to take photographs of the House proceedings from the press gallery. He requested camerapersons of electronic media not to go beyond their earmarked enclosures on the assembly premises to click photos.
