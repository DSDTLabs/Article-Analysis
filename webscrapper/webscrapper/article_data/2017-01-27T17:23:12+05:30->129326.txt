Actress  , who was last seen in a Malayalam movie in 2012, is back in the film industry with Jannat, a love story set against the backdrop of Northern Kerala.

 Ask her what prompted her to make a comeback with director R A Shafeer's film and the actress says, 'My previous outings in Malayalam were movies with Mohanlal sir in Casanovva and Mammootty sir in The King and the Commissioner back. I rarely take up movies with newcomers so when the team of Jannat approached me for the film, my first instinct was to say no. But when they narrated the story, I liked it and decided to go against my instincts.'
 
 Sanjjanaa plays a character named Khadeeja in the movie. 'It's the first time I am essaying a Muslim girl in my career. The movie itself is a musical love story about a Malabari couple. Malabar love stories like Thattathin Marayathu and Ennu Ninte Moideen have always managed to strike a chord with the audience. So, I am hoping this movie too would follow that path,' she says, adding that newcomer Ameer Shiyaz plays the male lead.
 
 While she has a few more days of shooting left for Jannat, the actress is currently busy in Telugu and Kannada. 'In Telugu, I am doing a movie titled Happy Birthday and in Kannada, I am working on Dandupalya 2 and 3. But it's good to be back in the Malayalam film industry after such a long time.'
