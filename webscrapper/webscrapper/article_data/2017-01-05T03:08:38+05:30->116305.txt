MUMBAI: National carrier   is all set to lock itself in a straight battle with the   as it will launch a three-month long sale that offers airfares at the cost of train tickets. The special fares will be on offer on all routes operated by Rajdhani. 

 The sale, which begins on Friday, will continue till April 30 and the travel period will be between January 26 and April 30. The only catch is that the special tickets, which will be available for purchase on the airline website, office and with travel agents, will need to be bought 20 days or more prior to the date of departure. 
 
 Under the scheme, a oneway, all-inclusive fare between Mumbai and Delhi, for instance, would cost Rs 2,401. Compared to that, the Rajdhani fare is Rs 2,595 for three-tier, Rs 3,860 for two-tier and Rs 4,755 for a first-class ticket. But on Wednesday, two days before the launch of AI’s scheme, the cheapest airfare on the Mumbai-Delhi route, say in February, was Rs 2,200, offered by low-cost airlines. That’s because other airlines too have ongoing sale offers, and so does AI, which currently has a 15-day advance purchase sale valid for travel upto April 15. 
 
 Unlike AI’s rail farematch sale, the current AI sale also covers destinations not covered by Rajdhani. But the fares on offer aren’t as low as AI’s Rajdhani sale. A Mumbai-Delhi one-way ticket, for instance, costs Rs 2,886. Last year, between June 27 and September 30, AI had a similar offer. But that scheme was targeted at last-minute travellers who found themselves on the Rajdhani waitlist, as these tickets could be booked only within the last four hours of the departure of a flight. “Over 27,000 tickets were sold,” said an AI official. 
 
 A travel agent requesting anonymity said, “In April-May, airfares to destinations like Srinagar, Chandigarh and those close to hill stations go up as schools close for vacation.” Accordingly, the cheapest, one-way air fare in April on the Mumbai-Delhi route has already touched Rs 2,400.
