NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday asked  , whose stakeholders include   president   and his mother Sonia Gandhi, to inform how much of the amount demanded by the income tax department it is willing to deposit, before its appeal can be heard. Young Indian had moved high court seeking a stay on the Rs 249.15 crore I-T recovery proceedings.

 The company’s plea came up for hearing before a bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and A K Chawla, which sought a reply by March 19.
 
 The recovery notice, under Section 156 of the I-T Act for the assessment year 2011-12, was issued to Young Indian on December 27, 2017. The company has also challenged the I-T order rejecting its application, and sought a stay on the direction to pay Rs 49.83 crore (20% of the total disputed outstanding demand).
 
 Senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing for Young Indian, submitted that it was a charitable company and does not have any income and the I-T authorities have wrongly raised the demand of Rs 249 crore. He argued the tax demand was “patently untenable” and the I-T officer had “over-assessed” the properties of the firm.
 
 The I-T department questioned the plea, arguing that the firm should have first approached the principal commissioner before moving the high court with its grievances and urged the court to direct the company to first deposit “some amount” before hearing its plea. When Young Indian claimed it did not have any income and it can only pledge its shares, the bench pointed out there has to be consistency, as it asks other litigants to deposit some amount of the total tax demand before hearing their pleas.
 
 Sonia, Rahul, Young Indian and others had been summoned earlier as accused by a trial court in the   misappropriation of assets case.
