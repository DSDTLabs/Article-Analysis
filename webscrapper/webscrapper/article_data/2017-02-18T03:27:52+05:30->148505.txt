MUMBAI: All schools across the state will have to conduct the third round of   tests in   and first language for students of classes I to VIII in April. Though the state has asked schools not to hold additional semester exams for these subjects, non-state-board schools said they would continue to hold their own maths and first language exams.

 “Our exams are not based on just theory and textbook. So we cannot use the state’s papers for our semester exams. This would mean that the students would give two additional exams, but we have been doing the same in the past as well,” a principal of a non-state-board school said. 
 
 A state circular said the   tests are consistent with school semester exams and can be a part of the cumulative assessment, and separate exams are not needed.
 
 Some teachers also questioned the process of conducting the tests. “Last time, papers were leaked and there was an inquiry, but there was no conclusion,” Uday Are, a teacher, said.
