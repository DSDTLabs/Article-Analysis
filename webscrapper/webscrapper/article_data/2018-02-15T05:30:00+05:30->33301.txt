Mysuru/ Hassan: Many residents of   and surrounding areas who own houses within 2-3 km of Vindhyagiri have vacated their houses and moved to other places like their home towns. They’re giving their houses on   on daily/ hourly basis to tourists and devotees arriving in large numbers for the Mahamastakabishekha and getting Rs 4,000-5,000 per day.

 S N Ravi, vice-president, Shravanabelagola gram panchayat, said this happens during every Mahamastakabishekha. "The house and room rents are based on facilities available and the location," he said.
 
 "There is a huge demand for rented houses till the end of this month. After that, the families return to their homes," he said.
 
 According to locals, most house owners look for devotees ready to pay rent on a daily basis. "For a house with two rooms and attached bathroom and toilet, the daily rent is Rs 4,000. A house with two-three rooms has been booked for 15 days. Many residents also rent it on on hourly basis charging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000," said Karigowda, a resident of Shravanabelagola. He added that houses and rooms in Nagayyanakoppalu area are in great demand. "This area is very close to Vindhyagiri and various townships built for the Mahamastakabishekha. As it’s on the Bengaluru-Shravanabelagola road, house owners charge more," he explained.
 
 Many feel that compared to 2006 Mahamastakabishekha, this year there’s no escalation in rent due to townships built by the state government. "Last times (2006), houses around 5-6 km away also fetched a good rent . But it has come down this year as everyone prefers to stay in townships. Within Shravanabelagola town, there’s a high demand for rented houses," said Rajesh Gowda, who runs a hotel on Channarayapattana Road.
