GURUGRAM: The   on Wednesday confirmed that 50 trees — fully and partially grown — were felled in Pali village to make way for a panchayat community hall, and also wrote to the   seeking action against the offenders.

 TOI investigation had revealed that more than 50 trees were felled in the area with the help of an earthmover. The   came to light on March 1, when the village panchayat of Pali laid a foundation stone to build a community hall. Apparently, no permission was taken from the forest department to fell the trees.
 
 The forest department had carried out an inspection in the area last week. “The forest officials’ team found out that 23 fully grown and 25 small trees were chopped. We have already filed a report on this,” said an official in the district forest office in Faridabad. Environmentalists, however, blamed the forest department for not taking adequate action against the violators. “The district forest office has all the powers to take action against the offenders. It is shocking that no action has been taken against the offenders. It’s obvious that the officials are facing political pressure. Now, they are passing the buck on each other,” Jitender Badana of Save Aravali, who took up the issue, said.
 
 Bhadana alleged an MP is involved in this. “The community centre was inaugurated by an MP. Also, the village sarpanch said this activity couldn’t be checked as the project was being carried out by an MP,” he said.
