Ludhiana:   at a makeshift chowk on BRS Nagar Bypass-Pakhowal Road intersection has turned into a pain for commuters in Ludhiana. There are traffic jams throughout the day at the chowk and personnel of the traffic police are mostly not seen here. Earlier, there was a traffic signal installed at this chowk, but now, the signal is non-functional, and a temporary chowk is being built there. The reason behind this traffic chaos is that people are not ready to co-operate with one another, and everyone wants to go first. Another reason behind the traffic congestion is a high number of vehicles due to increased population.

 Commuters say there is zero traffic management by the traffic police. “Traffic problem is one of the biggest problems. This specific chowk connects major areas. BRS Bypass also connects to the highway, and traffic congestion at this chowk is affecting many people. We have to wait for hours. There is no management by the police. This is a daily problem,” said Gaurav Sharma (43), a resident of Flower Enclave.
 
 Some residents of nearby areas say they have never seen traffic police managing traffic at this chowk. “I live in BRS Nagar, and my workplace is at a distance of just two kilometres. Since the day the traffic signals got non- functional, I have been facing this harassment. On an average, I wait for an hour daily just to cross this chowk. I never see traffic police managing traffic over here,” said Amit Kuma (30), a resident of BRS Nagar.
 
 Some commuters also request people to follow traffic rules properly. “The reason behind traffic being a headache for each and every person of the city is because people are not ready to follow traffic rules. Somewhere, it is because of the involvement of politicians. The police can’t control everything. When there are set rules, the public must follow them. Those rules are made for us. Until we follow them, we will always face the same problem,” said Twinkle Sharma (22), a resident of Dugri.
