GUWAHATI: Popular theatre director   is all set to   his maiden film,   

 The film is an adaptation of his popular drama of the same name and has been made on a budget of Rs 30 lakh; part of the money was obtained through crowd-funding. It will release on Friday.
 
 "We are thankful to everyone who has helped us make the film. Without the love and assistance of the people, I could not have made it. Now, we are eagerly waiting for the release on January 20," Das said.
 
 The film revolves around the intense rivalry between villagers during Rongali Bihu celebrations in the state. The competitive spirit culminates in the arrival of popstar Shakira at a local Bihu event. 
 
 "There is another twist in the tale which I cannot reveal now. We have shot mostly in South Kamrup with around 3,000 artists," he added.
 
 Das, an alumnus of the  , said several people living around the shooting sites provided them with equipment while others donated money. 
 
 "The locals were of great help. Some gave us food, others gave us their vehicles to transport unit members from site to site. Some helped us with money. So, this is a film made by the public," he said.
 
 The play was first staged in 2015 and was widely appreciated. It was put up by Guernica Creatovista, Das's theatre group known for staging innovative plays since 2007. 
 
 The troupe has staged different short plays on various topics on buses, parks and streets.
