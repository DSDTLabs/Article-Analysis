LUCKNOW: Turning BJP’s slogan ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’ on its head, the   on Wednesday launched the slogan #BhajpaSeBetiBachao on social media.

 Cornering the   government in the wake of the Unnao rape incident, the party posted a series of comments from its official twitter handle @INCIndia.
 
 
 The first post came as early as 7am. “BJP MLA and his aides accused of rape. Police arrest complainant’s father who dies in custody. Why is   government protecting the rape accused MLA?” it questioned.
 
 An hour later, the   said, “Law and order goes for a toss under BJP’s raj in UP. Yogi Adityanath’s ascent to power was accompanied by a 40% rise in rapes. What purpose did his anti-Romeo squads serve?” Another tweet said, “A larger question that the   needs to answer is why do their MLAs, workers, ministers and everyone in the party feel that they are above the law?”
 
 Party president   echoed the sentiment by tweeting, “UP mein apni beti ke liye nyay ki guhar kar rahe ek pita par hui barbarta ne manavta ko sharmsaar kar diya hai. (The uncivil treatment of a father who wanted justice for his raped daughter in UP has embarrassed humanity)”.
