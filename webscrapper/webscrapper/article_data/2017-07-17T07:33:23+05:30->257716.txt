LUCKNOW: Two women, both  , were found dead in their house at   under Gudamba   station on Sunday . The younger brother of Sandal Srivastava (60) and Kesar alias Jagnu Srivastava (46) said the women were robbed before they were murdered but police ruled out robbery .

 The house located near Jeevan Dhara Inter College was found ransacked. The two women ran a general store in the house while their younger brother Anjani operated a cyber café. Tenants also reside in the property the women inherited from their father.
 
 Anjani told police that when he reached the house, he found it ransacked and his sisters lying dead but in different rooms. Both rooms had been ransacked. IG and SSP who arrived at the crime scene were not convinced with the robbe ry charge as they found anomalies in Anjani's statement.Police enquired from neighbours if the sisters had peaceful relations with their brother.
 
 No injuries were found on the bodies and it appeared the assailants had used pillows to smother the women. SSP Deepak Kumar said there were no signs of forced entry .“There was no evidence of any stranger entering the house. Items may have been displaced to make it look like an incident of robbery , so we are checking if an insider is behind the twin-murder,“ said Kumar.
 
 Dog squad and fingerprint experts collected samples and an FIR charging unidentified persons of murder was lodged on the basis of complaint filed by Anjani. Kesar was unmarried, while Sandal separated from her husband long ago.Anjani lives in Jankipuram with his daughter and wife.
