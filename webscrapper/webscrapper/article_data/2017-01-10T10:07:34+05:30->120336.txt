RANCHI: A   of   was issued by the   earlier this week. However, the list covers only  . The other areas, including   and slums, have been left out. 

 The list includes 44 places where fogging would be done throughout January. These are the CJM and city SP residence, family judge house, the DIG residence, DC office, project and MDI buildings, houses of all the ministers and a few former bureaucrats and former ministers. 
 
 On the other hand, places like Ratu Road, Hindpirhi, Madhukam and other areas which have slums and are more prone to mosquito breeding have been completely neglected.
 
 Madhukam resident Savita Devi said, "Mosquito menace is a perennial problem in our area, but we never see RMC workers using fogging machines or any other equipment to get rid of mosquitoes. On the other hand, when we visit VIP areas we find that fogging is done on a regular basis. This shows RMC's indifference to the common people."
 
 The RMC has altogether 13 vehicles, two of which are big ones and 11 small, for fogging. But it is very rare for people who do not live in VIP areas to see these vehicles in their colonies.
 
  However, RMC's medical officer Kiran Kumar claimed as per the rules being followed since a long time, fogging is done only in VIP areas and nowhere else during winter. She said, "It has been an old practice that in December and January fogging is not done anywhere else except VIP areas as the mosquito breeding is less during this time. Fogging is done in VIP areas throughout the year as these have more plantation ."
 
 Kumar said fogging will start across the city from January end and will continue till June. From July to September, fogging will again be stopped and instead drains would be sprayed with chemical to kill the larvae.
