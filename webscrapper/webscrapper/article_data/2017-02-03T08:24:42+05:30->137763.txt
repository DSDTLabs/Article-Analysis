AMRITSAR: Announcement of Dera Sacha Sauda's support to the SAD-BJP combine for Punjab assembly elections has not come as a surprise for majority of Sikh bodies as they already apprehended an ongoing “conspiracy“ between the Akalis and sect head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh even after he dared to imitate the 10th Sikh master Guru  .

 While giving a call for boycott of the   family , core committee member of Panthic Talmel Sangathan, a conglomerate of various Sikh organizations, Jaswinder Singh Advocate said, “The move has established and exposed that the Akalis are in cahoots with the dera. Also the pardon to dera chief was granted through Sikh high priests in exchange for support in the elections.“
 
 He added what could be a more blatant acceptance of being hands in glove with the dera than `trading' the sect's support for political mileage by getting pardon for its head.
 
 Differences had emerged in 2007 between mainstream Sikhs and dera followers after Gurmeet Ram Rahim had made an appearance wearing clothes, as shown in photographs, usually worn by Guru Gobind Singh while perform ing an initiation ceremony during a function at   in Bathinda district. The incident had sparked an outrage among community members.
 
 Former DSGMC president   said, “The Jathedar of   should now rise to the occasion and summon the Badals and excommunicate them.“
