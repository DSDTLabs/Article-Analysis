COIMBATORE: PRG Arunkumar of the AIADMK, who represents the Coimbatore North constituency in the  , said on Saturday morning that he would not participate in the assembly proceedings when the Edappadi K Palaniswami government seeks a vote of confidence later in the day. 

 Arunkumar came out of a resort in   near Chennai -- where MLAs loyal to party general secretary V K Sasikala have been staying -- on Friday night. 
 
 Addressing reporters at his residence at Jothipuram in Coimbatore district on Saturday morning, Arunkumar said he would like the AIADMK rule to continue in the state but did not want the interference of Sasikala and her family. 
 
 "I don’t like family politics. Our AIADMK leaders MGR and Amma (former chief minister J Jayalalithaa) did not bring their family members to the AIADMK. But now the situation has changed," said Arunkumar.
 
 The MLA clarified that he would not support former chief minister O Panneerselvam and would not go to meet him. 
 
 "There is no restriction in the resort for MLAs and all are accessing televisions and mobiles. They knew the present political scenario. I am not ready to reveal other MLAs’ decisions," he added.
 
 “I discussed with party senior leaders before coming out of the resort,” he said.
 
 The MLA said he had resigned from the post of the urban district secretary of the AIADMK.
