PATNA: Slain Ara farmer Krishna Kumar Singh’s nephew Dilip Singh on Saturday alleged a principal secretary-rank IAS officer, belonging to the minority community, was giving patronage to land grabbers in Bhojpur district. "My uncle was murdered because of the bureaucrat’s patronage to criminal elements operating in the district," he said.

 Krishna was shot dead at Bhaluhipur near Ara in broad daylight on July 2. At least eight criminals pumped 23 bullets into his body.
 
 Addressing a press conference in Patna on Saturday, Krishna’s family members reiterated their demand for a CBI   into the murder. "The criminals murdered my uncle because he thwarted their repeated attempts to grab his 5.25 acre land," Dilip Singh said and regretted his family was neither being provided security nor being given arms licence, for which they wrote to the Bhojpur district administration soon after the murder.
 
 "The Bhojpur district administration did not take action even after my uncle gave a petition to the DM and the SP against the land grabbers on January 4, 2017," Singh said, adding police were yet to send a report to an Ara court which had ordered an inquiry on the plot.
 
 HAM-S leader Danish Rizwan, sharpshooter Chand Mian and suspended   member Indrabhushan Singh besides two others have been arrested in connection with the murder, but five other accused Naeem Mistry, Timla, Dibua, Shehrazuddin Safina and   Singh are still evading arrest. Monu is son of Ara deputy mayor Malti Singh. 
 
 "Even several government plots in the district have been sold by Rizwan in the last 3-4 years," Dilip Singh said and added they tried to seek the help of PM  , Union home minister Rajnath Singh and CM   through their official twitter handles before the murder, but to no avail.
