AGARTALA: Violating a Tripura high court order against reservation in promotion of government officers, the   promoted 30   (TCS) officers on Thursday. 

 Among the 30, only eight were general-category officers.
 
 The promotions evoked a sharp reaction from general-category officers in the state. Their union, General Officers' Welfare Association (GOWA), said the Tripura high court had last year ruled against reservation in promotion of employees citing 'over-representation' of SC and ST people in the government. 
 
 The state had approached the   against the ruling but the apex court had asked the   to follow the high court's order till the case had been disposed of. It had also asked the government to conduct a survey to find the number of SC and ST employees in the administration. The findings showed ST and SC employees constituted 51% of the government; the figure should be 48% (31% ST and 17% SC) as per the demography of the state.
