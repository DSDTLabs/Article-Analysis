LUCKNOW: Dreaded gangster   who was nabbed by Lucknow police along with his aide Kuldeep Jat after an encounter on Wednesday, was close to Bihar’s mafia-turned-politician   and had been taking arms from him. Naresh, who was absconding since 2007, also used to escape to Bihar after committing crime in west Uttar Pradesh districts and took shelter there.

 SSP/DIG Gautambudhnagar Love Kumar said that Naresh belongs to the gang of Sunder Bhati which has been at loggerheads with the gang of Ajay Dujana for over a decade. Dujana’s men run extortion racket in GB Nagar, Meerut and Ghaziabad by threatening businessmen and engineers.
 
 Lucknow ASP (west) Vikas Tripathi said that Bhati collected money from his sympathizers and bought a carbine from Sahabbudin’s men. Bhati was in contact with several gangsters.
 
 “Bhati suffered huge loss due to Dujana’s men. Besides, some other local goons were also facing trouble from Dujana,” Tripathi stated.
 
 SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar said that recovery of carbine, which Bhati purchased from Siwan is under probe. “We are trying to find out the relation between mafias in Bihar and those active in national capital region,” added Kumar. Police officials also said that Bhati was planning extortion from prominent businessmen in the city. Both Bhati and Jat were discharged from KGMU Trauma Centre after undergoing treatment for the injuries sustained in the encounter.
