The state government on Friday allocated Rs 2 crore to set up gaushalas (cow shelters) in 12 prisons of the state. In the next few months the cow shelters would be notified and the prison administration would receive the fund to tend to cows. 

 Several jails are running dairies on their campus, but once cow shelters will be set up prison officials will also have to look after the cattle which stop giving milk.
 
 The idea was floated by   (cow welfare commission) in November last year. Forwarding his suggestions to the home department, chairman of the commission  , retired IAS officer, appealed to principal secretary, home, to consider running gaushalas in Lucknow, Barabanki, Sultanpur, Sitapur, Bareilly, Unnao, Agra, Naini (Allahabad), Varanasi and at central jails in   and Bareilly. Kanpur Dehat is the 12th prison where the cow shelter would be established.
 
 Additional inspector-general of prisons department Sharad said that a feedback would be sought from jail superintendents of the prisons and the fund would be disbursed accordingly. TOI had highlighted how the commission was trying to convince both   and prisons department to establish cow shelters. While PAC had turned down the proposal, the prison department readily agreed to implement the idea.
