AMRITSAR: AAP replaced its   candidate Rajinder Kumar with former Congress leader Darbari Lal on Friday, less than 24 hours after it had announced Kumar’s name. The party has picked Lal over founder member Ashok Talwar, who was also lobbying for the seat. With the move, AAP has bypassed supremo Arvind Kejriwal’s assurance in December that the party would not make any further changes in its candidates.

 Though Kumar did not react to the move, Lal’s nomination has not gone down well with Talwar. He said he would meet the party’s central leadership on Friday evening. “I respect the party’s decision. But I am told by our volunteers that there were certain allegations against Lal. I want to discuss all these with them,” he said.
 
 Lal, a three-time Congress MLA and former deputy speaker in the state assembly, shifted to the BJP in 2014. He had joined the party in the presence of the BJP’s then   candidate,  .
 
 Ghuggi had announced Kumar’s candidature in a list of three candidates released on Thursday. It is being said that the change has been made because no AAP volunteer or leader in Amritsar had even heard Kumar’s name or the time he had joined the party. The party did not give an official reason behind the decision, announced by state convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich in a press release issued on Friday.
 
 Lal, who will be contesting against his former colleague and sitting Congress MLA OP Soni, said he would be reaching out to AAP volunteers and bring them on the same page. “These boys have done a lot of groundwork for AAP. But, the high command has decided to field me. There shouldn’t be any resentment. I will meet Ashok personally,” he said.
 
 When asked about the issues which he would take up during his  , he said, there were “several” of them. “Unemployment and drug addiction are on top of that list. The others concern farmers, industry, health, and many more,” he said.
