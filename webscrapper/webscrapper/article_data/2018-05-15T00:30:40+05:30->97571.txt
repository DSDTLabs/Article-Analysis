New Delhi: Allegations over the Indian Premier League had made Sunanda Pushkar’s death appear more suspicious and even resulted in a parallel probe by the economic offences wing and enforcement directorate. 

 Tharoor was accused of misusing his office to ensure that Rs 75 crore—equivalent to 19% equity in IPL Kochi franchise—was paid to Pushkar, whom he hadn’t married then. Tharoor had failed to convince the UPA government and lost his ministerial position as a result.
 
 While probing this,   had written to ED to probe the shareholding pattern of the now-defunct   team, Kochi Tuskers. The probe revolved around 4.75% sweat equity offered by a member of the consortium that won the franchise.
 
 Pushkar had to give up the equity when the then IPL chief, Lalit Modi, tweeted the ownership pattern in 2010. Police probed if Pushkar was offered the equity in lieu of the funds she had arranged for the team.
 
 BCCI subsequently terminated the contract of Kochi Tuskers. Police suspected Pushkar was used as a front. So her death was probed from that angle too. Journalist Nalini Singh had talked about Pushkar telling her hours before her death that “she had ‘taken over’ crime during IPL”.
