 Inspired by a collection of stories by great raconteur,  , ‘Dark Borders’ follows the tragic life stories of people brutalized and marginalized by circumstances and extreme poverty. Through the use of absurdity and humour, the plot lays before us the consequence of hatred and violence. The play creatively uses elements like water, earth and the corporeal presence of the actors. With a uniformly excellent ensemble, Mansingh presented the risqué and edgy short stories of Manto, which explored the human recklessness that rose to the surface during the bloodied chaos of the Partition. 
 
 The cast of the play included Mahesh Saini, Davinder Pal Singh, Jagjeet Singh, Debina Rakshat, Gursewak Singh, among others. 
 
 
 
 Potently philosophical in nature, ‘The Cabinet of Dr Caligari’ with its uncanny visuals is a scathing political commentary explores the horrors of fascism. The play has been inspired by the 1920 German silent horror film by Robert Weine. A quintessential work of German expressionist cinema, the plot tells the story of an insane hypnotist who uses a sleepwalker to commit gruesome murders. The film presents themes on brutal and irrational authority while reflecting a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant. 
 
 The theatrical piece was the director’s attempt to comprehend scenography, dramaturgy and actor's performance coming together to make it a 'complete' experience for the audience.
 
 The cast of the play included Prakash Bare, Taha Abdul Majeed, Leenaz Bicha, Purav Goswami, among others.
