The total revenue earned during fiscal year 2015-16 stood at Rs 315 crore, which grew to Rs 320 crore in the financial year 2016-17. 
 
 Despite the growth, officials pointed out that the department had missed it’s target of Rs 358 crore. 
 
 “There were several reasons for it such as non renewal of around 2,000 licences and increased utilization of buffer stock,” assistant commissioner of excise   said, adding that the situation would normalize in the next three months as retailers buy fresh consignments for their stocks. 
 
 The Supreme Court’s decision to ban the sale of liquor within 500m of highways came into effect from April 1 and around 3,000 licence holder in the state came under it’s ambit.
