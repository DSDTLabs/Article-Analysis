 ended 2016 on a high note. The singer was   on December 30, as part of  's fifth   ceremony, held in Kolhapur. The honour was conferred upon the 64-year old artiste for her contribution to music and also for popularising Indian scriptures 
  among others. The four time 
 Award winner has also received the Maharashtra State Government Award and National Citizens Award, among many others. 

  Accepting the honour, she said, “I fell extremely proud to receive this award in front if my family, who have been strength at every stage. I gave my biggest hits in the most difficult times of my life but then chose to quit   and focus on scriptures and devotional songs because it was my true calling. Today, I humbly accept this award that is a culmination of not only Bollywood and devotional music, but also my service to the farming community and the genuinely needy.”
 
 Despite contributing superhit numbers to the films like Ram Lakhan, Tezab, Hero, Ashiquee, Dil amongst many other, Paudwal is much celebrated for her bhajans and devotional tracks all over the world.
