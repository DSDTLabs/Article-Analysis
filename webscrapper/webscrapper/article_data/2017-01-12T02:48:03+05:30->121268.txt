NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday tore into the city’s civic agencies for their failure to keep capital clean, saying they work only “when we whip them from behind.”

 As a section of Delhi face a crisis of garbage piling up on roadside due to a strike called by safai karamcharis, a bench of Justice B D Ahmed and Justice   warned that the   should get cracking, and said it expects “perceptible difference in cleanliness” in the city. 
 
 “Why is it so difficult to move the public bodies and the government to take steps? All of you are non-starters. There is no winner in a race between you, as no one is running unless we whip you from behind. Why do you want courts to become slave drivers,” an irked bench demanded after it found that despite orders the corporations have failed to install bins for segregation of waste.
 
 It also asked other agencies, including PWD and DDA to launch another drive to   the city, after it expressed unhappiness with the 15-day cleanliness drive conducted in the last fortnight of 2016. “A further drive of 10 days be undertaken starting tomorrow. Report of fresh drive be filed at least a day before the next day of hearing,” it said.
 
 On December 14,   had directed a drive to be undertaken for 15 days for removal of ‘malba’ from parks and roadsides and when it took stock of progress, the court found the agencies’ efforts were a ‘non-starter.’ However, HC did note that   claimed to have installed such bins.
 
 “Some forward movement is there, but it is far from satisfactory,” the court said and warned the civic bodies “We do not want to be pushed into taking action resulting in coercive measures.”
 
 HC was hearing a PIL by Col (Rtd) B B Sharan who has sought directions for maintaining cleanliness in Delhi.
