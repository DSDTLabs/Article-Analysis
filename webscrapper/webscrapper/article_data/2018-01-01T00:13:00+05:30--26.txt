Chennai: Two motorcycle-borne miscreants who tried to escape after snatching an iPhone from a man were caught by two   near St Thomas Mount on Saturday night.

 The arrested were identified as Asif, 23, of Canal Bank Raod, Adyar, and Naveen Kumar, 23, of Kelambakkam.
 
 According to police, Adithya Motha, 27, of MKN Road, Alandur, was walking near St Thomas Mount at around 7.45pm when the two suspects came from behind on their bike and snatched his mobile phone. Adithya was caught unawares, as he was speaking over the phone. By the time things dawned on him, the duo had escaped on their bike. Adithya tried to chase them down but in vain.
 
 Incidentally, Adithya saw two armed reserve police constables – Jagadeesh Pandiyan and Livin Raj – and alerted them about the incident. They immediately chased the miscreants down and nabbed them. They handed over the duo to a police patrol team near St Thomas Mount.
 
 However, when the two were being taken inside the police station, they again made an attempt to escape but were outsmarted by the police.
 
 Interrogations revealed that the two were on their way back after stealing a motorbike when they saw Adithya, who, according to them, appeared to be an easy target.
 
 Police said they were also involved in a series of offences, including chain and mobile phone snatching cases, at Tambaram, Chrompet and Adambakkam.
 
 Police are investigating further.
