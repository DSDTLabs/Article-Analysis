Navi Mumbai: Come   Padwa and the streets of the satelite city will be filled with the aromas of various delicacies. From   to   puri and much more, Navi Mumbai residents, especially Maharashtrian households spend the day in preparing all these gastronomical goodies. 

 While some take time out of their busy schedule and painstakingly induldge in making these sweets, there are a few who prefer buying these sweets from stores. After shopping, food is the next best thing about the festival. 
 
 “While we do not use too much of oil and sugar in our cooking, on festivals we splurge. The health conscious might not be so thrilled with the food that is served on the day, but most people do enjoy the spread,” said Lakshmi Kurve, a Nerul resident.
 
 Many stores in   and   that specialise in homemade food have already started selling the festival favourites. Puranpolis, flavoured shrikhand, bhakarwadi, kothimbir wadi and crisp puris are being sold like hot cakes. “The sales of these delicacies have started picking up,” said Hemang Patil, a store owner from Vashi. Home made sweets are better sellers than the commercially made ones, he added.
 
 Some of the markets were crowded as people are stocking up on ingredients, especially those who prefer food that is prepared at home.
