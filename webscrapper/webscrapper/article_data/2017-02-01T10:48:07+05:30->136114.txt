NAGPUR: Senior railway officials said budget details will from now on be more of a statement of expected revenues and expenditures, allocation of resources and budgetary support to meet capex needs, as well as deficits and social obligations.

 “Though there is demand for 3 DEMU rakes and new trains to Ratlam, Raebareli and Lucknow, a weekly train to Goa may come through. We are already loaded with infrastructure works for at least 3-4 years for which we expect year-marked funds,” said a senior official. 
 
 “Continued push on upgrades of speed, safety, technology and capacity, including electrification, doubling, tripling, quadrupling of lines, automatic signalling, train protection and warning systems, production of new types of locomotives and rolling stock will continue to be the focus,” says railway analyst and expert Alok Patel. 
 
  general manager DK Sharma has already said that electrification, third railway line between Itarsi and Ballarshah and fourth line between Nagpur and Sevagram is going to see a massive push in the region.
 
 “Continued allocations for gauge conversion and electrification of Nagpur-Chhindwara-Nainpur, Balaghat-Jabalpur narrow gauge routes are expected,” said Basant Shukla, general secretary of Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK).
 
 Spending more on upgrading lines to run trains efficiently seems to be the focus. In the last budget, 11 new lines worth Rs 30,000 crore were sanctioned in Maharashtra.
 
 Shukla said several demands announced in last budget like mechanized laundry, bottling plant, world class station, railway medical college have not been implemented.
 
 ZRUCC member   says fare changes, policy, projects, new trains and other items with political implications are being announced throughout the year.
 
 “I think timely execution of projects continues to be a major issue. While railways earlier announced creation of a special function for the purpose of monitoring and speedy execution of projects, not much headway has been made. Similarly, re-organisation of railways to become more output centric also seems to be going ahead very slowly,” says Shukla.
 
 Pradeep Khandelwal of   says Central Railway has failed to utilize new Narkhed-Amravati line which was constructed at a cost of Rs 800 crore.
 
 “The home platform, for which major route changes were made, is also grossly underutilized. There is no proper parking facility at Santra Market side and there are goons extracting money from drop and drive cars. The new coach care centre constructed at Ajni is also underutilized, with a couple of trains being maintained there. These issues need to be addressed,” Khandelwal said.
