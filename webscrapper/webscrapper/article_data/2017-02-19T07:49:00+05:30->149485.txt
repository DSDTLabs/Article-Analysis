GURUGRAM: Summer is yet to arrive, but the city has already started reeling under power cuts.

 Just a day after TOI reported about a five-hour power outage haunting the residents of   1 on Thursday, another four-and-a-half-hour   was effected in the area on Friday, apparently for  .
 
 The situation in sectors 3, 5 and 6 was equally dismal, with the areas witnessing five- and three-hour outages on Friday and Saturday, respectively. Power discom officials attributed the outages to switch change work in the area. 
 
 Residents had to suspend many of their chores that they had saved for the weekend. The three-hour power cut on both the days threw a spanner in their plans.
 
 “Most working women do laundry-related chores during the weekend. These outages have ruined our schedule,” said Kalpana Behl, a resident of Sector 5.
 
 Dinesh Vashist, RWA president of sectors 3, 5 and 6 said there are 5,000 people living in the area who have been affected by frequent outages. 
 
 Discom officials, however, said that scheduled cuts during this period were normal. “If we don’t carry out maintenance work at this time, when else can we do it then?” said a discom official. “For us to conduct switch changes, we will have to cut off power supply.” 
 
 The official added that the exercise would only benefit the residents. “It will decrease the likelihood of recurrent power cuts in summer,” he told TOI.
