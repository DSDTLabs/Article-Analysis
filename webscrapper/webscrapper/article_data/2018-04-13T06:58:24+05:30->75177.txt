MUMBAI: Sanjiv Mehta will take over as chairman of Hindustan   ( ), succeeding Harish   who is set to retire from the post of non-executive chairman at the company’s forthcoming annual general meeting in June this year.

 
 Mehta, 57, who completes five years as CEO & MD in October this year, has got an extension of another five years by the board of the company. To ensure compliance with the new regulation based on the Kotak committee on corporate governance report, which   has accepted, HUL said it will separate the two positions of chairman and managing director by April 2020.
 
 On Manwani’s retirement, Mehta said, “Harish leaves behind a legacy that few will be able to match. He has lived the values that make HUL such a great company. Through his passion, commitment and endless energy, he leaves a lasting impact on the business. I will personally miss his leadership and wise counsel.”
 
 Manwani, 64, has been the longest serving chairman of HUL. He took over as the non-executive chairman of the company in July 2005 and, during these 13 years, he oversaw a period of sustained growth, beating phases of slowdown in the industry, and helping the business to nearly triple in size.
 
 Manwani was the first Indian manager who rose to the COO level at Unilever, the parent company of HUL. As COO, a post he held for three years since 2011, Manwani’s key achievement was to establish and align the regional clusters across the world with a clear agenda of creating a better and more integrated go-to-market organisation.
