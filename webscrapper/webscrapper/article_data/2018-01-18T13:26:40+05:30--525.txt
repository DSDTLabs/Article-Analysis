In the latest episode of Shakti- Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki, we see Preeto and Soumya talk about the letter from before. Surbhi also enters and gives something to Preeto. Later, she asks if Soumya is fine.She tells her that she knows Soumya went to meet Kareena and Raveena. She tells her that Rani called her and informed her and warns her that they are planning to go against Soumya. Soumya says she is not worried about it as her family is always with her.

 Later, Surbhi gives her a suit on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. At the function, Harak Singh dances with Mohini and everybody is enjoying themselves. Meanwhile, Preeto helps Soumya get ready for the event. At first, Soumya refuses and then she gets ready. Harman comes to the room and is astonished seeing Soumya's beauty. He jokes that people at the function will get injured seeing somebody so beautiful.
 
 
 At the function, she is with Harman when she remembers Mohini's threat. Harman asks her what is wrong because she looks very sad. Preeto asks her to come inside if she is tired while Harman enjoys some time with his friends.
 
 Mohini comes inside where she sees Harak Singh lying on the bed with fever. She calls everybody to the room. Maharani calls Soumya and asks her why did she not do her work.She tells Soumya that she is a kinnar and how can she think of herself as a woman.
 
 She once again chides her for having no sense of shame. Soumya says that she is trying her best to do the required work. Maharani tells her that she has added poison in one of the wine glasses the waiter is serving to the people at the party.
 
 Soumya immediately goes outside and takes the glass Harman is holding and throws it on the floor. Harman asks her what happened but she says nothing. The Maharani once again calls Soumya and tells her that one of Harman's friends is dangerous and can take Harman's life. Soumya begins to worry and look around.
