 Barkhad Abdi is part of 'Blade Runner 2049' and he says he plays a scientist who is totally deformed. "He's a scientist and he's totally deformed," the actor says in an interview about his role in the film, a sequel to  's 1982 classic. 

 Footage from director Denis Villeneuve's 'Blade Runner 2049' stunned audiences last month at CinemaCon, with the presentation helping assure viewers the film was truly expanding on Scott's vision. 
 
  
  
 The sequel stars   as Officer Q and original star Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, as well as  , Robin Wright and Ana de Armas. It takes place decades after the events in Blade Runner, with Q tracking down Deckard for a mysterious purpose.
 
 For Abdi, who shot scenes with Gosling, the weight of living up to the original was on his mind. "It's not pressure, it's a blessing. But for me, I do everything that I do to the full extent like it's the last one. I feel an obligation to (surpass) Captain Phillips that's my goal."
 
 "So every time I have an opportunity, I like to do what I can, because I'm all about this (career)." 'Blade Runner 2049' is set to release on October 6.
