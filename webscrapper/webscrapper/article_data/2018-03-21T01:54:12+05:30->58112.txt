NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday fixed a ceiling of Rs 50 for public bodies, including legislative assemblies and high courts, for providing information under the Right to Information Act. A bench of Justices A K Goel and U U   also ruled that the government bodies could not charge more than Rs 5 per page for giving photocopies of documents sought under the Act.

 
 
 It also ruled that public authorities could not force an   applicant to provide reason or motive for seeking information. The court passed the order on a batch of petitions challenging the rules framed by different authorities fixing their own charges for providing information under the RTI Act although the parent law says that only Rs 10 has to be charged from information-seekers.
 
 Advocate  , appearing for the petitioners, told the bench that the Allahabad HC charged Rs 500 per information under the RTI Act which was illegal and it was intended to discourage citizens from seeking information. He said as per the HC rule, an application for information should be for only one item, it should be accompanied by Rs 500 by way of application fee and that the citizen should pay Rs 15 for every page of information.
 
 He said that rules framed by the HC were quite different from the rules framed by the Centre which have also been adopted by the SC for disclosing information to citizens as the fee prescribed by the HC is 50 times the fee prescribed by the Centre. Similarly, the cost of one page of information is only Rs 2 as per the Central government rules whereas it is Rs 15 as per the Allahabad HC rules, he said.
 
 He also referred to an order passed by the   which had held that such stringent restrictive conditions, including such high level of fees, would surely deter citizens from freely seeking information from the HC which was not in conformity with the spirit of RTI Act.
