NEW DELHI:   the 44-year-old football great from Almada,  , had mixed feelings a day after his former club Barcelona pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in   history.

 Figo spoke exclusively to TOI about Barca as well as former teammates and current managers   and  . Excerpts …
 
 You have been a former teammate of Barcelona coach Luis Enrique. Why do you think coaching Barca burns out even the best like Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, and now Enrique?
 
 I think at the end of the day it is the personal decision for Enrique. To coach top clubs is very exhausting and probably because of that they (Rijkaard, Guardiola and now Enrique) decided to take a break.
 
 How would you rate Zinedine Zidane’s stint as Real Madrid coach?
 
 In a club like Real Madrid there are a lot of top players. I never expected him to end up as coach at Real during our playing days — probably because of his personality. The expectations and demand for results is very high, so is the exposure. You have to know that responsibility. I am a fan of Real Madrid first before being a friend of Zidane.
 
 Do you think Premier Futsal can have a viewership in India?
 
 We are pleased about the first season and we just hope that we can continue the success for many years and help develop this sport in this country. We expect in second session to create entertainment for everybody.
