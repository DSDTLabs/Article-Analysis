Vijayawada: A fact-finding committee constituted by the government to probe rumours of a ‘tantric puja’ that was reportedly conducted at Sri Durga Malleswara Temple on December 26 is learnt to be of the opinion that no such puja was performed at the temple.

 The panel has hinted that it has till now found nothing in the course of its investigation that would substantiate the charges of such a puja being held at the temple.
 
 The fact-finding committee headed by M Raghunath, assistant commissioner in endowments department, interrogated priests, temple officials and trust board members on Friday. The enquiry started in the morning on Friday and continued all day long. Temple head priest Badrinath Babu was questioned by the committee for two hours. Apart from the priests, the committee also questioned about 40 temple staffers.
 
 Speaking to reporters, Raghunath said they would submit the report to the government after recording the statements of the temple trust board chairman Gouranga Babu and other members. As the enquiry process of board members went on till late evening and the committee was yet to scrutinise two hours of CCTV footage, the report to the government is likely to be submitted on Saturday. Surprisingly, the fact finding committee did not question the temple EO A Surya Kumari.
 
 Raghunath hinted that the enquiry committee has come to a conclusion that no tantric puja was performed as they did not find any pumpkins in CCTV footage. Pumpkins are said to be a key part of tantric pujas. 
 
 Agama Sastra adviser Sriram Sharma, who is also part of the enquiry committee, said no one has the guts to perform tantric puja in Sri Durga Malleswara Temple.
