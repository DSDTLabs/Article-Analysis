Pune: A 19-year-old youth from Guruwar Peth received a message from an unknown number on his cellphone about three years ago. When he replied, he learnt a woman had sent the text and started chatting with her. Little did he know, it was a trap laid by his brother-in-law. He started blackmailing the youth and extorted Rs5 lakh over the past three years. When the accused started demanding more money, the frustrated youth approached the Khadak police and lodged a complaint. A Khadak police team led by senior inspector Raghunath Jadhav swung into action and arrested the 29-year-old brother-in-law of the complainant late on Monday night under sections 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) and 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) of Indiab Penal Code. tnn
