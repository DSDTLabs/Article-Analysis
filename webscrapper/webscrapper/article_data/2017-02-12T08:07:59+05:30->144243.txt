NEW DELHI: Though there was a minor dip in the number of fatal  , city   continued to be unsafe in 2016. More alarmingly, police were not able to solve even half of the cases reported last year, a majority of which were of hit-and-run nature.

 In 2016, accidents, on average, claimed five lives a day. As many as 1,548 cases were registered during the year, slightly down from 1,582 in 2015. More than 770 cases were unsolved.
 
 The year gone by saw traffic being helmed by three different people. The term of the current chief, Ajay Kashyap — a 1985-batch officer — is also nearing its end. Traffic cops argue that solving accident cases is the job of the local police, but given the high number of fatalities at night, much more needs to be done to secure Delhi roads. 
 
 Traffic police data reveal that 40% of those killed in road accidents are pedestrians. Another 40% of the victims are two-wheeler riders. The two Ring roads are veritable death traps with 203 people perishing on these stretches.
 
 In 2016, 84,200 people were booked for speeding against 2.35 lakh in 2015. Similarly, 90,261 were challaned for jumping traffic signals in 2016 against 4.01 lakh in 2015.
