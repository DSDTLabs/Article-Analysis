PATNA: The Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation ( ) has temporarily suspended operations of its two cruise ships – MV Ganga Vihar and MV Kautilya Vihar – due to rise in water level of the Ganga. People wishing to undertake luxurious river cruise will have to wait for the monsoon to end to enjoy the services.

 MV Ganga Vihar, the larger of the two cruise vessels, has already been out of service since January due to repair work. The other ship, MV Kautilya Vihar, will also not be seen floating in the river due to rise in water level of the Ganga.
 
 “A proposal has been forwarded to suspend the operations of MV Kautilya Vihar due to safety reasons,” said BSTDC general manager Jai Nath Mahto. “The river gets flooded in monsoon and brings a lot of debris from other parts which may damage the engine of the ship. Once the water recedes, the ship will resume its operation,” said a BSTDC source. 
 
 The corporation has been running MV Ganga Vihar, a cruise ship-cum-floating restaurant, between Gandhi Ghat and Gai Ghat since July 2009. It has a capacity to accommodate 60 people. The MV Kautilya Vihar, on the other hand, was started in June 2016 and it has a seating capacity of 30. The two vessels provide a luxurious river cruise and a thrilling cruise experience, where one can spend a few hours in evening for the magical charm of lush greenery and historical ambience.
