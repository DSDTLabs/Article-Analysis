Dealing with scores of petitions pertaining to police officials abusing common people in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Justice A   of the Hyderabad high court has directed both the states to constitute the   (SSC) and   (PCA) within three months from now.

 This is in tune with the   Judgement in the Prakash Singh case and even though it is 10 years since that judgment containing several guidelines to the states was pronounced, these two mechanisms were not brought into existence so far, the judge said. Once formed, all the complaints, including the ones that came to the court, should be referred to the SSC and PCA, he said.
 
 Detailing the apex guidelines, Justice Rao said PCA should be set up, both at district and also at the state level. While the district level PCA should be headed by a retired district judge, the state level PCA should be headed by a retired HC judge.
 
 The state can choose the state PCA chief from a panel of names sent by the chief justice of the high court, the judge said. For the district level PCA, the CJ can either suggest a panel of names or he can authorise a sitting judge of the HC to do the same. These authorities will be assisted by three to five members depending on the volume of the complaints against police in districts. The members can be selected by the state in consultation with the  , state human rights commission etc.
 
 Justice Ramalingeswara Rao also referred to the apex court direction about formation of SSC to ensure that a state government does not exercise unwarranted influence or pressure on the state police. Each SSC shall be headed by the chief minister or home minister as chairman and have the DGP of the state as its ex-officio secretary.
