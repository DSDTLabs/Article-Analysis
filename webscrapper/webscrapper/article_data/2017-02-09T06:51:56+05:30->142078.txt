 Dabholkar began the discussion with a question on who is and who can become an entrepreneur. She elaborated on the challenges faced during an entrepreneurial journey by a woman. 
 
 “Women go through altogether different stresses than men. There are nine types of entrepreneurial role stresses: Challenge stress, self-role stress, role overload stress, role inadequacy, resource inadequacy, result inadequacy, role irrelevance, inter-role distance and role isolation,” she said. 
 
 The study involved 51 persons, half of whom showed the problem of role irrelevance which is difficulty in balancing family and work and a feeling of loneliness. 
 
 She compared women of the West and the East. “Great similarities are seen among women of the western countries and India. Studies have shown that they both face problems of expectations from husband and in-laws. But sharing problems and grievances is very important as it helps relieve stress. There is a misconception among women that they do not have many role models. But they need to realize that they themselves are the role models they are looking for.”
 
 Dabholkar encouraged women to simply start. She also emphasized the importance of self-reflection. 
 
 The discussion ended with Dabholkar telling women entrepreneurs that they need not be ‘superwomen’ and that they should take on the work that they can handle. She encouraged them to not feel bad about asking for help.
