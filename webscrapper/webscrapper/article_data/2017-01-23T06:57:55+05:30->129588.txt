LUCKNOW: The erstwhile constituency of former Prime Minister and revered BJP leader   has several 'outsiders' as candidates fielded by the party. 

 Former UP Congress chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who joined the BJP a few months ago, is the party candidate from Lucknow (cantonment).
 
 From Malihabad (reserved), the wife of Mohanlalganj MP Kaushal Kishore has been fielded. Similarly, Dr Neeraj Bora, the son of Late DP Bora, has been made the candidate from Lucknow (north). Bora had joined BJP during the Lok Sabha election campaign. 
 
 According to party insiders, national vice-president and Lucknow Mayor Dinesh Sharma was vying for a ticket from the seat. 
 
 Former MLA from Lucknow (central) and runner-up from Lucknow (west) in the last assembly elections, Suresh Srivastava has found favour with the BJP and has been given a ticket from the same seat. Suresh has expressed his anger against outsiders getting tickets instead of party loyalists and has even posted his resentment on his Facebook page. He is said to be close to Union home minister Rajnath Singh.
 
 Outsider and former Rajya Sabha member from the BSP, Brajesh Pathak, is a surprise candidate from Lucknow (central). Pathak is pitted against sitting SP MLA and minister Ravidas Mehrotra.
 
 MLA Ashutosh Tandon 'Gopalji' has again been given a ticket from Lucknow (east). Sources said Ashutosh was given the ticket mainly to appease former MP Lalji Tandon, who was forced to leave the seat for Rajnath for Lok Sabha elections. 
 
 The Bakshi Ka Talab seat has gone to Avinash Trivedi.
