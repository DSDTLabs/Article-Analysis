MUMBAI: A 63% increase in the number of   complaints received by the BMC was observed in 2016 compared to the previous year. In fact, in January and December 2016 the recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) was higher than in previous years. Incidentally, last January a fire broke out in the Deonar dumping ground which went on for almost a week. 

 A civic white paper released by the NGO Praja stated that in 2015, the BMC received 94 air pollution complaints while in 2016 it went up to 153. On the other hand, complaints registered owing to pollution due to chemical effluents in 2015 stood at 33, while in 2016 it went up to 51. 
 
 Milind Mhaske project director at the NGO Praja said, "These figures are from complaints made to BMC on their helpline 1916 and also those registered with them on their website. The figures clearly indicate people today are waking up to the problem of pollution and it's important the authorities take cognizance of it." 
 
 Neha Parkhi, programme officer from   project said, "Even we have started getting more queries on air pollution." 
 
 "Today, the situation is such that in case of a blaze at the dump, parts of the city far from the dump also get enveloped in smoke. The smell of garbage burning definitely does not go unnoticed," said  , who lives off the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road.
