Lucknow: On the festival of colours, the colour most conspicuous is   and orange of the Bharatiya Janata Party flag as supporters tossed loads of kesariya gulal in the air to celebrate the landslide victory in the state on Saturday and Sunday. Orange color   remained highest in demand and some shopkeepers even raised its price to double. 

 At several shops selling   colors, specially in the vicinity of BJP’s party office opposite Vidhan Bhawan, saffron gulaal was selling out fastest. “I bought gulaal of three colors and while the rest were priced at Rs 20 per 100 grams, orange was for Rs 35. When I asked the shopkeeper why, he said ‘Modi ji ka rang hai mehenga to hoga hi’,” said Veena Yadav, a homemaker.
 
 “Not just the party workers, many staunch   supporters were buying it too,” said Rishi, a Chowk shopkeeper reasoning for its high price.
 
 “This year, all our family members and traders association decided to play Holi with only or mostly saffron gulaal to celebrate Modi’s win and I have ordered 5kg of aromatic ‘kesariya’ gulaal and marigold petals to mix it with,” said Neeraj Agarwal, a jeweler from Chowk.
 
 Shopkeepers at several places, including Puraniya, Gole Market, Mahanagar and Badshahnagar also confirmed that high demand had led to dearth of orange gulaal in market. “Ever since election results were announced more than 100 customers came asking for orange gulaal. On Saturday, my stock was over, so the next day I purchased it in bulk but I think this will also be over by evening,” said Shyamlal, a color vendor in Nishatganj.
 
 College-goer Siddharth Sharma said, “I live in Daliganj but had to go to Hazratganj to get gulaal for Holi as there are more than two dozen shops in my locality but none of them had orange color.”
