Nagpur: The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has launched 45% and 30% concession for senior citizens on fares on luxury ‘Shivshahi’ buses from June 1. Talking to mediamen on MSRTC’s 70th anniversary, which is observed as ‘Transport Day’, deputy general manager (Nagpur & Amravati) Sudhir Panchbhai and Nagpur divisional controller Ashok Warthe said the concession will be available for inter-city buses in the region and long distance sleeper class buses to Pune and Nashik. Warthe said introduction of Shivshahi buses has helped the corporation to win over its lost customer base. “Post Shivshahi, our occupancy has increased to 70-75 persons from 40-50 on an average,” he said. Buoyed by the success, the division has demanded 100 more Shivshahi buses, which may be added to the existing fleet this financial year.  Warthe said MSRTC is in for revamp of its all buses in phases. “The old fleet will be modified at its central workshop and 25 buses are already in process of modification to attract customers,” said Warthe. Panchbhai said there is a Rs10 crore plan to renovate Ganeshpeth main bus stand. It will also be expanded by constructing 20-25 more platforms. At present, there are only 18 platforms. “There will be better facilities for drivers, conductors and passengers too,” he added. Warthe said, the MSRTC staff has been told to be polite and treat passengers well. “There will also be regular drives to keep bus stands and buses clean,” he added.
