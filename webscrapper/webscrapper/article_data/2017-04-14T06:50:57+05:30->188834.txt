BENGALURU: For   chief  , the results were a big setback. He had camped in the two constituencies, making it a personal prestige battle.

 His campaign rhetoric centered around how victories in these polls will help him become CM again.Yeddyurappa also turned it into a personal battle between himself and Siddaramaiah. But the defeat would rankle more because he failed to deliver the entire Lingayat vote in the BJP's kitty. Voices of dissent against Yeddyurappa too could grow louder, given his inability to win even one of the two seats for the BJP, despite them being Lingayat-dominant constituencies.
 
 The loss also means that Yeddyurappa's political stature will take a beating and may give way to infighting between him and senior leader  . The byelection results also puncture the tall claims he made that 150 of 224 seats in   are the BJP's for the taking next year. The defeat will also make those planning to join the BJP reconsider their move.
