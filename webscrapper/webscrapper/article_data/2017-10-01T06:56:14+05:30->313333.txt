CHANDIGARH: A 17-year-old girl, who had allegedly eloped with a Muslim boy a fortnight ago from Joshi village of  , was brought back and electrocuted by her father and her uncle in the name of family 'honour'.

 They tied her up and killed her by putting live power cables in her hand in the wee hours of Friday and then quietly cremated her. The incident came out on Friday afternoon when a police party headed by Matlauda station house officer (SHO) Narender Singh reached the village. Girl's father Suresh Kumar and uncle   have been arrested. Both were produced before the duty magistrate on Saturday and sent to police remand.
 
 Matlauda DSP Bali Singh, who is the supervising officer in the case, said the girl was the second of the seven children of Suresh. He said she was a school dropout and used to help her mother in household chores. Police said a group of masons had come to Joshi last month and the girl got involved with one of the masons and eloped with him to Kandhla town in Shamli district of UP . Police said her parents did not lodge any complaint and managed to bring back the girl within a week. "We came to know about this during the interrogation of the girl's father and uncle. They have no remorse over what they have done," said DSP Singh.
 
 The Matlauda SHO said, "They waited until night and gagged the girl before using a high voltage cable to electrocute her. We came to know about her death in the morning. The family had cremated her before our team could reach the village. Forensic experts have picked up samples for DNA examination."
 
 He further said the girl's father and uncle were produced before the court on Saturday."Since their custodial interrogation was required, the court allowed one-day police custody. We will be taking them to their house to recover the electricity wire used by them to kill the girl," the SHO said.
