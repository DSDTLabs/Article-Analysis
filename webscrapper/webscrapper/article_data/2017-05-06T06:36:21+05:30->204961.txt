TRICHY: When a caller addressed him as   and respectfully spoke in Hindi,   knew it was a wrong call and politely told him so. Moments later, he got a similar call. A barrage of such calls from different numbers followed, all addressing him as Shrikanth Sharma, Uttar Pradesh minister of power, and speaking in Hindi.

 Swamped by over 500 calls a day, intended for the honourable minister, Yahiya, 39, a used car dealer from Palakkarai in  , is at his wit's end. On Friday, a week after he began receiving these unwelcome calls, the beleaguered man sought the help of the cyber crime police to sort out the matter. 
 
 "The callers spoke in Hindi, which I was unable to understand, except the name. No one understood my language Tamil and they repeatedly called this number," Yahiya told TOI on Thursday. 
 
 The calls did not cease even past midnight. Exasperated, he approached his relative S Sherif who searched on the internet and found that Yahiya's number was listed on the website of the UP unit of the BJP: http://up.bjp.org. The Hindi website displayed the numbers and photos of ministers in the state. 
 
 Now Yahiya is in a real fix. He has been using the number 9********5 for the past 10 years and his customers call him on this. Junking the number would mean losing business. In fact, he suffered losses in his business when he de clined to answer many calls from unknown numbers, suspecting they were meant for the UP minister.
 
 A search by TOI on the internet showed that the contact number of Shrikanth Sharma was given as 9********5 on another website.
 
 When contacted, a cyber crime police officer told TOI that a team would investigate the case and, hopefully, sort it out soon.
 
 Till such time, Yahiya has no option but to use all his will power, stay awake and patiently answer unending calls.
