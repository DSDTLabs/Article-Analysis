VADODARA: Tempers are expected to soar at M S University’s annual senate meeting on Monday.

 “We want healthy and detailed discussions during the senate meeting instead of walkouts and ruckus. For us, senate is the supreme body of academicians which meets only once in a year and there should be detailed deliberation on all the issues,” said Dr Adeesh Jain, spokesperson of the Sankalan Samiti. 
 
 The other issues include the process of admissions at the   (ILG) which has been in news since the time of rustication row. The samiti had already demanded a thorough probe into the entire episode which had come to light after two students had alleged that they were rusticated after meeting JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar during a study tour.
