KOLHAPUR: The civic body has started scouting for a plot of land to set up a new theatre auditorium in the city.

 According to an official from the mayor’s office, the   (KMC) surveyed seven sites in the city. Two sites have been shortlisted so far— one near the Circuit House and another near Isolation Hospital.
 
 Both the plots have a spacious four-acre area and a theatre with a capacity to seat around 2,500. Other facilities such as conference rooms and rehearsal areas for actors, along with other facilities such as parking and sanitation will also be made available.
 
 Mayor  , said, “We took the decision to set up the new theatre as we felt that the existing Keshavrao Bhosale Natyagruha is falling short in terms of capacity and also the space needed for parking and other facilities. We have appointed a consultant to prepare the design for the theatre. The selected locations have easy connectivity to the suburbs.”
 
 The idea for a new theatre auditorium came up during the civic elections held in November 2015. Residents in the suburban areas said that the Keshavrao Bhosale Natyagruha was too far for them as it is located in the city’s   area.
 
 After taking over as mayor, Faras met Nationalist   (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in December 2016. She said that Pawar had asked them to find locations to set up a new theatre and he will be talking to the state for funds.
 
 “We have asked civic authorities to plan the meet with Pawar on Friday or Saturday. Both land plots are under the state. The civic body does not have sites with over 4 acres and so, we will be relying on the government for the land,” Faras said.
 
 The KMC renovated the historical Keshavrao Bhosale Natyagruha by spending around Rs 10 crore. But, work for the second phase that includes parking, toilets and other amenities are yet to be approved for funds.
