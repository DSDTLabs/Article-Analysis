NASHIK: The civic body’s new   — extension of a 50-year-old hospital — was to be dedicated to the city before the   in August 2015. Well past its deadline, the hospital is now expected to be complete soon with 80 per cent of the work already completed.

 “We have finished 80 per cent of the work. We will complete the entire construction work in three months,” informed an NMC official. “The RCC work is complete, plaster, colouring of the outer wall, 70 per cent electrification is also complete. Water proofing, water tank, underground ramp and area development are underway. By three months the construction work will be completed,” he said.
 
 The official added that after other departments finish their work like electrification,  , ICU, plumbing work, among others there would be slight damage that the public works department will have to repair.
 
 The proposal for the hospital was approved in 2011 and the work order was issued in 2012. But initial teething problems along with red-tapeism inordinately delayed the construction of the hospital.
 
 The standing committee of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had approved Rs 53 crore for the first phase of the hi-tech hospital. The deadline for completion of the 17,000 sqmt ground-plus-three floor building was set at three years from the time the work order was given in 2012.
 
 Diversion of the 200 meter nullah on the plot, shifting fire brigade that was using the plot and civic staff quarters, demolishing public toilets with 37 units and constructing the toilets behind the old hospital, demolishing the unused market yard, demolishing the NMC gym on the campus among other works consumed time.
 
 In addition, heavy rain in 2012-2013 also hindered the project when rainwater had to be drained from the 22-feet trench dug for construction.
 
 The three-storey building was to be completed before Kumbh with 125 beds to cater to the health needs of the pilgrims and also to that of patients from   and nearby rural areas.
