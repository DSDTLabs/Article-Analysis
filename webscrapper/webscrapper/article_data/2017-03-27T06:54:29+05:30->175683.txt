GUWAHATI: Transport authorities will soon crack the whip on schools which allow parents and drivers of school buses to park their vehicles on the road. 

 Officials of the Regional Transport Authority, Kamrup ( ), said schools functioning without proper   space might face action unless they mend their ways within May. Schools will have to identify proper pick-up and drop spots for students who travel to and from the institution in their own vehicles.
 
 "If schools do not create their own parking space or earmark parking lots for guardians' vehicles within May, stern action will be taken," said an   official.
