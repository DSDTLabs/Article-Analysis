Bhopal: State forest department’s Special Task Force (STF wildlife crime) has booked four forest department employees for letting off four of seven alleged poachers in a black buck poaching case. 

 One forest guard was arrested and others, including a range officer and two forest guards are at large. STF said forest officials were accused of not producing before the court. 
 
 They were also accused of disposing confiscated carcass without court’s permission and presence of an authorized person. They have been booked under sections 50, 51, 52 and 53 of Wildlife (Protection Act 1972)- charges liable for jail term for three to seven years, said STF officials. Three forest guards have been suspended and action is likely to be taken against the range officer, if he doesn’t reply to the explanation sought from him, STF officials said.
 
 A black buck poaching case was reported from Bakani village of Damoh district September last year. Forest officials arrested three people after which a massive protest was initiated in the region with locals alleging that the wrong people were arrested. tnn
