 fame   and   tied the knot on Monday (February 5) in an intimate ceremony, which saw the presence of close friends and family. The wedding took place in Alwar, Rajasthan.

 Even though pictures from the ceremony haven't been shared by the couple on their social media handles, their fan clubs are buzzing with all the updates. Several photos and videos have emerged online, which give us a glimpse of the fairytale wedding the two had. 
 
 Both Gautam and Pankhuri went the traditional way on the D-day. While Gautam chose a beige sherwani, Pankhuri looked delicate in her red ethnic wear. She opted to wear a lehenga for the main ceremony. The videos and photos from the wedding show Gautam dancing with the 'baraat' and then later posing with his wife on the stage. The two looked happy and in love. 
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 Before their wedding ceremony, the couple had mehendi, haldi, engagement and cocktail functions as well. Gautam and Pankhari shined throughout with not just their glamorous outfits but also their romantic dance on some popular Bollywood numbers. 
 
 Gautam and Pankhuri fell in love on the sets of TV show Suryaputra Karan. The two dated for two long years but kept their relationship away from media glare. It was only last year when they had a roka ceremony that Gautam confirmed to BT, "Yes, Pankhuri and I recently got engaged and I feel lucky to have found a life partner like her. We share the same wavelength and she has fit into my family perfectly."
 
  
  
 Back then, even Pankhuri confessed that she has found the right match in Gauram and she is looking forward to spending the rest of his life with him. Their relationship also had the consent of their families, which made them even happier. 
 
 Pankhuri has starred in shows like 'Yeh Hai Aashiqui' and 'Kya Qusoor Hai Amla Ka?', while Gautam is known for his roles in 'Saraswatichandra', 'Lucky' and 'Mahakumbh', among others.
