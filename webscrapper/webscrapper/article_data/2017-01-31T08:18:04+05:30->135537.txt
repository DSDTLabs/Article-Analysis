HYDERABAD:   producer   on Monday secured   in a   booked against him at the   police station in the Rachakonda commissionerate. 

 A 24-year-old Mumbai-based theatre artiste, who is a friend of Morani's daughter Zoa, had lodged a complaint with the Hayatnagar police alleging that the producer had sexually exploited her and even blackmailed her to upload their intimate pictures on the internet. 
 
 Police are waiting for the call detail record (CDR) of the accused and the victim to figure out if he was present in Hyderabad when the alleged offence took place at a prominent film studio in 2015. 
 
 Three days ago, Morani's counsel moved an anticipatory bail petition before the IV additional metropolitan sessions judge of Ranga Reddy district. After hearing arguments of both the parties, the court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to Morani with a few riders.
 
 "The petitioner (Karim Morani) is entitled for anticipatory bail. In the event of the arrest of the petitioner, the petitioner shall be released on bail on his executing personal bond of 50,000 with two sureties for like sum each to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. Further, the petitioner shall cooperate with the investigating agency and shall attend before the investigating officer as and when required and shall present before the court whenever required by the investigating officer for further investigation in the matter (sic)," the court said in its order.
