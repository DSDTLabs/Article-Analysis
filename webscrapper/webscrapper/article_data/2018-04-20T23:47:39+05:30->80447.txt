 The Special Category Status was first accorded in 1969 to Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and Nagaland. Over the years, eight more states were added to the list -- Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura and, finally, in 2010, Uttarakhand. 
 
 The Centre pays 90 per cent of the funds required in a centrally-sponsored scheme to SCS category states as against 60 per cent in case of normal category states, while the remaining funds are provided by the state governments.
