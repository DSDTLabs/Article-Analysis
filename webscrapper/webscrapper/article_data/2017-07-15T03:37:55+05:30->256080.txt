NEW DELHI: India on Friday assured Myanmar that it will step up military ties, ranging from arms supplies to joint exercises, as part of the overall thrust in upgrading the defence, diplomatic and economic relationship between the two countries. PM Modi told the visiting commander-in-chief of Myanmar armed forces, Senior General  , that his country "is a key pillar" of India's 'Act East' policy, while appreciating the ongoing bilateral defence and security cooperation. 

 The PM expressed his " firm commitment" to strengthening bilateral ties with Myanmar in his meeting with the Myanmar military chief, who also received briefings on India's security perspectives and Indo-Myanmar defence cooperation. 
 
  While Gen Min Aung Hlaing condemned the recent terror attack on Amarnath Yatra pilgrims, the PM conveyed his condolences on the loss of lives of Myanmar military personnel and their families in the tragic air crash on June 7. 
 
 The Myanmar general, who earlier visited defence establishments and other places around the country since his visit on July 7, also held discussions with defence minister Arun Jaitley, national security adviser Ajit Doval, Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba and Army chief General Bipin Rawat. 
 
 As earlier reported by TOI, India is ready to further crank up military supplies to Myanmar, the only Asean country with whom it shares land and maritime boundaries, as part of the strategy to counter Chinese inroads into the country. 
 
 India already provides Myanmar with 105mm light artillery guns, rocket launchers, rifles, radars, mortars, bailey bridges, communication gear, night-vision devices, war-gaming software and road construction equipment as well as naval gun-boats, sonars, acoustic domes and directing gear. 
 
 The two countries have also enhanced coordinated patrolling between their armies along their 1,643-km land border to mount pressure on Indian insurgent groups operating in the thickly-forested region there.
