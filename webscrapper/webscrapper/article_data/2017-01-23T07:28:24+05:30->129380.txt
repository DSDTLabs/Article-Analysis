BENGALURU: The   department has instructed government-run hostels under its control not to collect undertakings from students and parents during admission. 

 TOI had on December 21 exposed the practice (Welfare hostels using bonds to threaten us: Students), which education experts, lawyers and the government itself had termed illegal. 
 
 Investigation by the department was based on this report, which quoted from the bonds accessed from the hostels. According to one of the bonds, a class V student and his mother were made to give an undertaking before the boy was admitted to a social welfare department hostel, which had a clause that reads they are responsible “in case he goes missing”.
 
 It also said the hostel will not be responsible if he gets addicted to any kind of narcotics, and death resulting from that. “Your son can be expelled under such circumstances,” it reads. Students told TOI that hostel wardens were using such bonds to threaten if they complained about bad food or wrongdoings of the officials. 
 
 Mohammed Mohsin, secretary, Backward Classes Welfare department, who had earlier denied there are provisions for hostels to force parents or students to give an undertaking, said: “Given that such bonds are illegal, I instructed the commissioner to issue a circular to all hostels not to demand such undertakings.”
 
 After examining the documents that TOI had accessed, the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) had written to the backward classes department seeking a report on December 21. 
 
 KSCPCR chairperson  , who visited the backward classes department on Friday, said: “The department has now issued a circular prohibiting all hostels from demanding such undertakings.” 
 
 However, it is still unclear as to what action has been initiated against those wardens who have been demanding such undertakings for several years.
