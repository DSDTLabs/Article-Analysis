MALAPPURAM: The   (IUML) removed   the president of its women wing  , who was caught in a controversy for showering praise on  , on Saturday.

 The general secretary of Muslim League   has informed in a press statement that Khamarunnisa was removed from the post of president and the vice-president of the organisation and K P Mariyumma has been appointed as new president temporarily. 
 
 It was on Thursday that Khamarunnisa had made the controversial remarks lavishing praise on BJP while handing over her contribution to BJP’s development fund at her home town Tirur. At the function she said BJP is growing fast in Kerala and outside. "I wish BJP will be able to do good work for the development of the state and its people," she said.
 
 The statement did not go down well with the party leaders and Khamarunnisa Anwar had tendered an apology to the IUML leadership for what she termed a case of “slip of the tongue”. Khamarunnisa submitted her written apology along with a clarification to IUML state president Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal. 
 
 In her apology, Khamarunnisa said the news about her statement in connection with BJP’s fund collection was misleading. “It is common that representatives of different parties approach us as part of their fund raising programmes. I never thought that the visit of BJP’s local leaders to my home for fund collection will become a topic of debate,” she said in the letter. The party had accepted the apology after finding her explanation to be satisfactory.
 
 But on Saturday the party decided to remove her from the post due to strong protest from the party workers. Talking to TOI Khamarunnisa says that she was removed as she is yet to deny her statements praising BJP, though she has tendered an apology. Khamarunnisa said that the party will soon reconstitute the state committee of Vanitha League.
