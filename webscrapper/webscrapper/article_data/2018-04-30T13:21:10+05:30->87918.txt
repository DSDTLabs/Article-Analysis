LUCKNOW: After getting relief from  , four outlets of   (BP) in the city, which were closed down last year after they were found fleecing customers by dispensing less fuel, will become operational once again.

 
 The Supreme Court had on April 23 ordered that BP be permitted to make its four outlets functional with the condition that the dispensing units found tampered will remain sealed and police probe will continue.
 
 New dispensing units will be installed to make them functional, it said.
 
 BP had filed a petition in SC stating that its pumps should be allowed to re-open as their closure is causing inconvenience to public. The company assured the court that new technological advances will be used to check anomalies in future and that it will not influence the ongoing probe in any manner.
 
 A BP official said that its four outlets, Sheo Narain and Sons in Cantonment, Lucknow Filling Station in front of KGMU, LP   and Sons near Daliganj crossing and Maan Filling Station in Puraniya, Aliganj will become functional from May.
 
 The four stations are at important locations and people were facing inconvenience due to their closure, he said.
 
 In total, 43 fuel outlets in the city were shut down in April 2017 after STF unearthed a scam in which station staff tampered fuel dispensation by using a remote. Of the total, 20 outlets which sealed for minor issues have already started operating this month following relief from local courts.
 
 Assistant rationing officer (ARO)   told TOI that all the 24 pumps are those in which the land is owned by oil company. The pumps still closed are those in which both land and pumps are owned by private dealers.
