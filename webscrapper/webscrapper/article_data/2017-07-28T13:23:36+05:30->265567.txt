ZIRAKPUR: Waterlogging led to a traffic jam at   chowk, Panchkula chowk and   lightpoint on Thursday morning. Commuters were stuck for more than half an hour in peak traffic. 

 Vivek Soni, a resident of Dashmesh Colony, Zirakpur, said, “I have been stuck here at Patiala Chowk for half an hour due to traffic jam. There is no one to manage traffic as traffic lights have stopped working.”
 
 The stretch from Patiala chowk to Panchkula chowk to Baltana was choked. Balwant Singh, a cab driver, said, “I was going to pick a customer in Zirakpur but I have been stuck in the traffic jam at Panchkula chowk. It took me more than 30 minutes to come out.”
 
 Apart from this, internal   of Zirakpur were waterlogged. Besides, potholes and open sewage led to accidents involving two-wheelers. 
 
 President, VIP Road Welfare Federation, Karan Bedi said, “When I was driving home from office, the front bumper of my car was damaged due to a pothole filled with water. Infrastructure in Zirakpur is in a bad condition. The government needs to provide basic facilities to residents.”
