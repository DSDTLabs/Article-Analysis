Bollywood music is something that Chennaiites love as much as kuthu numbers. This one at a city pub was exclusively for the Bollywood music lovers. The DJ had all the hit numbers, including a few pulsating retro tracks ready on his playlist. As small groups of   peeps started trickling in, the DJ got started with the music. 

 Talking about the ongoing cricket extravaganza, the cricket buffs had nothing, but only praises for the Chennai team. Ashok wore his heart on his sleeve and sported the teamâ€™s T-shirt. Ladies like Bavithra and Mahima were dressed smartly for the do and had appreciative looks coming their way all through the party.
