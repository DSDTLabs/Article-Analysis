Muradnagar: A semi-urban area located off NH-58 in  ,   lags in several development parameters. The youths are disillusioned due to lack of proper education facilities and employment opportunities. 

 The upscale areas of central Ghaziabad like Raj Nagar, Kavi Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Govindpuram are in Muradnagar assembly constituency where   give emphasis to developmental issues.
 
 In the rural belt, cane farming is the main occupation though it has been rendered unattractive as there is no timely procurement of produce and clearance of dues against it. There are power looms in households of the town but they no longer generate adequate employment. There are hardly any big industries in Muradnagar even though a portion of Ghaziabad Development Authority’s Master Plan has earmarked a zone in the area for industrial development.
 
 Though local residents claimed that caste equations would play a major role in the assembly elections, people are expected to vote along development lines .
 
 “For higher education, the youth have to go to Ghaziabad, Delhi or Modi Nagar. The youth in this part of the district is mostly semi-literate and lack professional education. A skill development centre can be set up to provide vocational training to youth,” said Vireshwar Tyagi, a Muradnagar-based homeopathic doctor.
 
 In terms of civic infrastructure, Muradnagar has better roads than other rural areas like Loni. But households in these villages get very little electricity throughout the year.
 
 According to local residents, candidates of all major political parties had been banking on development plank to win the elections. But no one ever had a blueprint for the overall development of area which has led to the region lagging in several parameters.
 
 Wahab Chaudhary of the BSP won the 2012 assembly polls by a slim margin of 3,600 votes over his nearest rival Rajpal Tyagi of the SP. In 2014, the tide completely shifted to the side of the BJP.
