Candolim: Chaotic scenes marred the Candolim panchayat gram sabha on Sunday, after sarpanch Blaize Fernandes said that no development proposals could be discussed because of the model code of conduct, despite the sabha being called to discuss development proposals.

 Villagers demanded that the panchayat build a new, larger hall to hold the sabhas, which the panchayat members agreed to. Villagers then brought up various other issues, with some of them getting into verbal duels with others and at some point even snatching the cordless microphone given to members. 
 
 Deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, was also present, said there would be a special gram sabha in September to discuss the outline development plan (ODP) for Candolim, after villagers raised queries about the ODP.
 
 Villagers also demanded a crackdown on touts
