Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has ordered notice on a   seeking restoration of land allotted for a  , but used to construct houses. 

 The division bench of justices K K Sasidharan and G R Swaminathan ordered notice on the PIL filed by N Dhamodaran of Madurai alleging that the land allotted by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) for petrol bunk is being used to construct houses.
 
 According to the petitioner, the housing board brought a layout to construct houses for people belonging to weaker section under the urban development scheme at Mela Anuppanadi in Madurai.
 
 Accordingly, the TNHB allotted 1,600 sq.mt of land to one Usman Faheed to construct a petrol bunk. But, he did not construct the petrol bunk there. 
 
 Instead, he sold the land to many people who have now started constructing houses and shops there.
 
 The action was a violation of deed, made with the TNHB. The Madurai Corporation also gave permission to construction. 
 
 There is no petrol bunk in the surrounding areas of Mela Anuppanadi. Hence, it is necessary to restore the land and to set up a petrol bunk there, the petitioner said.
