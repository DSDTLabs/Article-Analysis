AHMEDABAD:   Vaniya, the widow of  , said that the last words her husband’s said to her were “run away or they will kill you”. Mukesh Vaniya, a 30-year-old Dalit man, was tied up and beaten at a factory near   town in Rajkot district on Sunday morning.

 Mukesh, his wife Jaya and his aunt Savita, were picking rags and paper waste near the factory concerned when the incident occurred. The family had moved to Rajkot just 10 days ago, from Parnala, their native village in   taluka of   district.
 
 “Mukesh, Savita and I were picking rags and paper waste when the five persons came to us and told us to clean up some filth from near their factory. When my husband said that we only pick rags and paper waste, they started abusing us and used caste-based slurs,” Jaya told TOI.
 
 “When my husband refused to do as they wanted, they started beating the three of us. My husband then screamed that I should run away or they would kill me. Savita and I fled on seeing him being attacked by the accused persons,” said Jaya. 
 
 “I rushed home and told other family members about the incident. By the time all of us reached the factory, he was dead,” added Jaya.
 
 “We then took Mukesh to  , believing that he could yet be saved. The doctors there declared him dead,” Jaya said.
 
 Mukesh and Jaya have two children, Sumita (10) and   (4). Neither are aware of the killing of their father.
 
 “Sumita is in class V and Jatin is yet to start his education. Now I don’t know what will happen, as we have lost him,” she said.
 
 Sukhdev Rathod, a neighbour of the Vaniyas, said that a representative of the social justice department met the family and promised Rs 5,000 in assistance every month. 
 
 “It is very difficult to console the children, who have been asking where their father is. How can we tell them that their father has become the latest victim of caste-based violence,” said Rathod.
