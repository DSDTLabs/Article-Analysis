LUCKNOW: The   dominated decisively by the   may start a new tradition by expressing gratituted to Governor   when he comes to the House and addresses the joint session on May 15, before the first session of the 16th state assembly.

 Usually, the House greets the governor after motion of thanks ut this time as soon as he concludes his address, the Speaker of the House will thank him. Naik will address a joint session of the Assembly and Council on May 15 and read out his full speech unlike as on past occasions when he was disrupted by the Opposition before he could finish his speech. The BSP was at that time in the Opposition while SP was in power and the BJP in the Opposition played a neutral role.
 
 Now, since tables have turned after the assembly elections and BJP is now in power and SP in Opposition, there is a new plan to welcome the governor with the Assembly extending him thanks for his address.
 
 Speaker of UP Assembly Hridaya Narain Dixit told TOI that though final decision has not been taken yet, it is very likely the assembly would greet and thank the Governor for his address.
 
 “It is a tradition in our country to greet elders visiting our home with folded hands and the same will be followed in greeting the governor at the House,” said Dixit, adding that instead of waiting for three to four days as is the usual practice, the governor would be thanked right after his speech.
 
 A year back, at a conference of the heads of states, Ram Naik had raised the issue of protocols for governors in the state and on his suggestion, office of the President issued new guidelines to states which included that the Governor should be received by the Speaker and the chief minister as soon as he alights from his car and then led in with a procession and to the sound of trumpets.
 
 Given to the soured relations between the then ruling   and Naik, the business advisory committee and Leaders of the legislature parties, except the BJP had rejected the new protocol regiment and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had closed the chapter saying legal advice should be sought on this matter.
