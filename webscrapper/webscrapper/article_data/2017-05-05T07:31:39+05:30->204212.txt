CHANDIGARH: Staffer of a   owned by former assembly speaker and senior Akali politician   was injured in violence that took place at a local   on Thursday.

 Kahlon’s son   alleged that their employee, identified as  , was attacked around 11.30am by musclemen of another bus company owned by a Congress leader's family. He said their staff was threatened and stopped from operating their buses despite having valid permits. “We have valid permits on which we are operating our buses. It is high-handedness when Congress made a lot of noise about transport business,” he said.
 
 Bobby, a local goon, was assaulted by a group of men with sharp edged and blunt weapons. He was later admitted to a local civil hospital.
