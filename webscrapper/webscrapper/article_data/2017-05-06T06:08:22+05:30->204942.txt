BHOPAL: After living it up for three months at his native village of Xiaozhainan, Chinese Army veteran Wang Qi has decided to return to India along with his family. But in two minds.

 The family hasn’t yet decided whether to continue to live in a dusty village in Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh — where he spent almost 54 years after being caught by the Indian Army — or to return to his birthplace in Shaanxi province of China.
 
 “We will reach India on May 11. My father is very happy after a reunion with his family members but we have not yet decided on settling down,” Wang’s son Vishnu told TOI.
 
 Wang Qi was captured on January 3, 1963, when he walked into Indian territory. He said at the time he was a mechanical survey engineer and inadvertently crossed the border. Since the war was over, he was treated as a spy and not accorded POW status. After being moved from one jail to another for eight years, he finally settled in a remote village named   in Balaghat district under an Indian name. He married and had children but always yearned to return home.
 
 After struggling for years, Wang and his family arrived in China on February 10 and were given a grand welcome in Xiaozhainan where his elder brother lives. It’s a small village that meant the world to Wang during his years in India. He was overwhelmed to be reunited with his family and wants to spend the rest of his life in his native village, but only if his Indian wife and children agree, said sources. 
 
 His return to China had hit front-pages in Chinese media even as the government tried to cash in on the situation by showcasing how they got one of their lost citizens after much effort. The Chinese government has given a two-year visa to his son Vishnu, his wife and granddaughter but they haven’t decided whether to settle there.
