MUMBAI: Fifteen years after he was first arrested for a heist at a Taj Colaba suite, jewel thief Jayesh Ravji Sejpal remains a wanted criminal.

 Jayesh was last arrested by Agra police in 2006 and later released on bail.
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 After the theft at Park Hyatt Hotel in Hyderabad on Monday when he stole Rs12 lakh worth gold ornaments by entering a honeymoon suite, police checked CCTV footage and noticed Jayesh boarding a green auto, but they couldn’t get any further with the lead. 
 
 Hyderabad police also began digging into files for information on Jayesh, a Gujarati from Andheri. Police found Jayesh had struck at star hotels in Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Jalandhar, Chandigarh, Agra, Bengaluru, and Gurgaon. “We know he has committed offences even in Kerala, Rajasthan and Gujarat,” Banjara Hills police said.
 
 His modus operandi is to target affluent couples checking into luxury suites. Police said when the couple leaves the room, he makes a call to the reception complaining about a faulty room key. When the staff arrives with a duplicate key, he quickly enters the room and escapes with valuables. His aide Ramesh Bhanaji Chhag’s job was to keep a watch on the movements of the victims. Chhag and Jayesh teamed up for the first time as undertrials in Arthur Road Jail.
 
 Jayesh made the richest pickings, perhaps, at Mercure Hotel at Abids, Hyderabad. “After the couple went to attend the function, he called the reception saying his wife had taken the original key and he needed a duplicate. After entering the room, Jayesh even made the hotel staff open the locker, claiming he had forgotten the password, and fled with jewels worth Rs 7 lakh,” an inspector told TOI.
 
 In 2013, Jayesh had escaped the police dragnet after committing thefts at Radisson Hotel, Jalandhar, and Hotel Park Plaza in Chandigarh, but Chhag was arrested.
