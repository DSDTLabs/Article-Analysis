LUCKNOW : BJP’s candidate for   parliamentary bypoll Upendra   is the first in 29 years who is not from   temple. Upendra (57) is known to be more close to Shiv Pratap Shukla of the anti-Yogi camp and it seems he has mended his relations with Yogi Adityanath .

 A senior   strategist told TOI that Shukla is in fact Yogi Adtiyanath’s choice. He said that Yogi now knows that he would need the backing of RSS and party in state and national level politics and hence did not want any disturbance.
 
 
 With the 2019 Lok Sabha elections being the next target for both BJP and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Shukla the win or loss in Gorakhpur would have a direct impact on Yogi’s political journey.
 
 The main responsibility of ensuring Shukla’s win from Gorakhpur now rests on Yogi Adityanath. If Yogi is able to convince voters that Shukla is his choice, BJP is likely to win easily.
 
 Yogi was five-time consecutive MP from Gorakhpur seat since 1998 after his Guru Late   abdicated the seat after remaining on it since 1989.
 
 A BJP leader close to CM said that since Yogi has shifted to larger canvass of politics,  , an organisation backed by him would not suffice and he would need the backing of RSS and BJP and hence he would toe party line when needed.
