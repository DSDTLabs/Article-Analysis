HYDERABAD: Two per cent was all that came between him and the chief minister's chair in the 2014 elections for YSR   chief  . That razor thin difference in vote share made a big difference in the number of seats it could garner. Out of the 175 Assembly seats, TDP won a comfortable 102 seats but   was left far behind with only 67. It is another matter that several YSRCP legislators switched loyalties and became part of the ruling TDP. Jagan set his eyes on 2019 polls without any delay. In his latest attempt at mass contact, he has already covered 1,400 km in 107 days. 

 The late CM and Jagan's father YS Rajasekhara Reddy had walked 1,470 km in 63 days in 2003 in undivided AP, which connected him to the masses. In the 2004 polls, Congress won and YSR became the CM. Now, Jagan is on a 3,000-km walk mission to interact with the masses. His public meetings have huge attendance. That is giving him hope of victory in the 2019 elections. Jagan did draw huge crowds before the 2014 polls too but could not get enough seats to form a government. His candidates lost by a small margin in several seats. During a 208-day padayatra that ended in 2013, Chandrababu Naidu had walked 2,800 km and in the 2014 elections, his party rode to power. 
 
 On the very day that YSR died on September 2, 2009, in a helicopter crash, Jagan made it clear that he was the heir to the throne. Congress president  , however, installed senior Congressman K Rosaiah as the CM. He quit the Congress and launched his YSRCP. 
 
 The souring of relationship between the BJP and TDP is a matter for delight for him. Jagan can hope for the scenario to swing in his favour in the 2019 polls. But, he will also have to reckon with the presence of Jana Sena Party.
