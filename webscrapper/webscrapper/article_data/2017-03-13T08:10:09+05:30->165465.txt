HYDERABAD: Anger was palpable on Capitol Hill when protesters came out in droves to condemn the killing of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, who was shot dead in the US in a hate crime on February 22. 

 Some members of the   joined the vigil organised by the South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), a national South Asian civil rights organisation, and other partner organisations. 
 
 Rajdeep Singh Jolly, interim managing director of programs,  , said, "As we remember Srinivas Kuchibhotla and all those who have lost their lives and loved ones to hate, we demand that the   create a federal task force to prevent hate violence. Words are not enough."
 
 Referring to President Donald Trump's delayed reaction, SAALT executive director Suman Raghunathan said, "Waiting nearly a week before commenting on a deadly shooting in   won't do it." She called for 'real leadership', to stem the tide of injustice. Protesters discussed how in a few weeks, three Indian men and one Sikh were shot at, two of whom died. 
 
 The members of Congress who joined the vigil included Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Congressman Ami Bera, Congressman Joe Crowley, and Congressman Ro Khanna. 
 
 Jayapal said, "One of the messages I want to send to people who are out there listening is that America is your country, you belong here, and we will stand up to protect your rights." Khanna too said the US must stand together against hateful words and actions, and prosecute any hate crimes. Congressman Crowley said, "This (such crime) is something that unfortunately has developed because of hate rhetoric and hate speech that developed during the campaign and has continued." Bera described the attacks as disturbing. "Attacking someone based on where they come from insults the very core of everything that we stand for as a nation of immigrants," he said.
