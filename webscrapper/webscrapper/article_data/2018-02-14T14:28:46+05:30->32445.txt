MADURAI: Nearly two months since the district police launched ‘Madurai Kavalan’, a mobile application aimed at bringing down house break-in incidents, it is yet to reach out to the masses. With hardly 2,000 downloads, the number is very less considering the estimated total population of 16 lakh living in the district limit and each family possessing multiple smart phones.

 Madurai district superintendent of police N   said they are utilising all options available to popularise the app, www.maduraikavalan.com. While many are yet to embrace it, those who have already downloaded it have found it quite useful. Many college students have downloaded and started providing information, he said. 
 
 “In a day we receive around 10 petitions, which include complaints, suggestions and information from the house owners on locked houses. The information is passed on the beat police, who ensure safety of the houses. The secrecy of the information is maintained,” he said. 
 
 Another police officer said that not many house break-in incidents were recorded last month. Apart from the mobile application, various other crime deterrence efforts which are being taken, have also helped reduced incidences of crime. Various efforts like reaching out to college students are being taken up to popularise the application.
 
 One of the users,   says that it is a very good application considering the safety and security of the people. He recently sent a complaint and to his surprise, police immediately responded, he wrote in the comments section of the app available on   Playstore. Like Deepak, many have given positive reviews about the application. They also lauded the efforts undertaken by the police.
