 Mayor Ram Gopal Mohaley claimed that improvement is storm water drainage system is evident this year as localities like Vinayaka, where waterlogging occurred even in dry weather earlier, are facing no problem in this monsoon. He admitted that people in areas like  , where sewage projects could not be completed before monsoon and localities of trans-Varuna are facing problem and added that these problems would also be solved soon.
