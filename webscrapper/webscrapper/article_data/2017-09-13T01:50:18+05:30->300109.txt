NEW DELHI: Terming   a “failed dynast”, BJP hit back at his criticism of PM Modi and the government, with information & broadcasting minister   saying he had chosen to air his views in the US as no one was listening to him in India. 

 Irani said Rahul’s admission that his party had turned arrogant in 2012 — ahead of the 2014 polls — was a taunt to the leadership of party chief  . “It must be the first time that a Congress vice-president chose to taunt his party president, and it is for the party to delve deep into the matter,” Irani said at a press conference held hours after Rahul’s Berkeley address. 
 
 BJP challenged Rahul’s claim that India was run on dynastic lines, citing the incumbents of India’s top three constitutional offices. “President Ram Nath Kovind, VP   and PM Narendra Modi come from humble backgrounds. It shows merit matters, and not dynasty, in today’s politics,” Irani said. 
 
 “A failed dynast today chose to speak about his failed political journey in the US... the country (India) is not listening so he is speaking somewhere else,” Irani said. She added that Rahul’s “arrogance” remark was a “big political confession” and a reflection on Sonia. “The fact that Rahul chose to belittle the PM is not a surprise... It is an indication of his failed strategy. The people of the country where he leads a party no longer support him so he is expressing his pain abroad,” Irani said.
 
 BJP ally JD(U) too criticised Rahul. “Justification of dynastic rule by Rahul Gandhi is an assault on the basic tenets of the world’s largest democracy,” JD(U)’s Pavan Varma said. 
 
 Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad added, “There is a tradition of our country that we don’t talk about domestic politics overseas. Despite being from a big family, Rahul did not pay attention to this tradition.”
