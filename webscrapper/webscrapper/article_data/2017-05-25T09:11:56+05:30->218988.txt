PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Pimpri Chinchwad mayor Nitin Kalje will meet municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar on Thursday to look into the issue of building a temporary bridge over the Mula river, as demanded by   villagers.

 Shiv Sena group leader   said, “An all-party delegation, comprising mayor, Sanjog Waghire of the NCP, Sachin Chikhale (MNS) and former corporator  , on Wednesday met Santosh Ghule, a villager who is on an indefinite fast in Pimpri for a temporary bridge over the river. We are with the villagers in their agitation. The   too has expressed its support to the agitation.”
 
 Its been two years now that the road linking Bopkhel to Pune-Mumbai highway was closed following a high court directive. The pontoon bridge put up by the College of Military Engineering later, too was dismantled in July last year.
 
 Earlier on Tuesday, villagers of Bopkhel, Ramnagar and Ganeshnagar observed a complete bandh in support of Ghule.
 
 Suresh Dalvi, a retired defence employee, said, “My son Yogesh lost his life as he could not be rushed to the hospital after he suffered a heart attack. If there would have been a temporary bridge, then he could have been taken to the hospital quickly and maybe he would have survived.
