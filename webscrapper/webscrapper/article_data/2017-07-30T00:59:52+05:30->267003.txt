 Arjun’s colleague, Ashok  , told the cops that they had received a call of power cut from sector 9 of the area. 
 
 “We reached the area around 5.30pm and Arjun climbed up the pole. A few minutes later I saw a spark and Arjun fell from the staircase. He had no injuries on him, but I suspect he was electrocuted,” said Kumar.
 
 He claimed that they switched off the main transformer of the area before starting work. “But around 5.45pm, the transformer was automatically switched on,” he added. 
 
 Police said that prima facie it appears to be a case of electrocution. “We are waiting for the post mortem report to ascertain the cause of death,” said Chinmoy Biswal, additional DCP (south).
