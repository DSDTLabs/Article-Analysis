CHENNAI: Police arrested two people on Saturday for cheating the   office of Rs10 crore over the past five years, by submitting fake bills and receipts. Police had arrested a furniture showroom owner Mohammad   in connection with the case on February 27.

 The suspects arrested by the   police on Saturday were identified as Raj   emplyees Justin and Rajesh. They helped Younis to process his bills and released funds to him without proper accounting of the bedsheets and other furniture at the Raj Bhavan office.
 
 The duo were remanded in judicial custody. Police personnel initiated the arrests based on a complaint from the deputy secretary Savuri Rajan, who looks after the administration of the governorâ€™s abode. The cheating came to light after   ordered a detailed investigation based on complaints soon after he assumed office last year.
 
 The inquiry, in which accounts for the past five years were scrutinised, revealed that Younis had systemically cheated the Raj Bhavan of money to the tune of Rs10 crore.
