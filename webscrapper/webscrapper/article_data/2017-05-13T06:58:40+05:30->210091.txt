SHIMLA:   took up the   issue with Jammu and Kashmir at the   (NZC) meeting held in Chandigarh on Friday. While raising the issue of boundary dispute at Sarchu and Shinkula, which has been unresolved for the last three years, HP revenue minister   underlined the need to resolve such   at the earliest. 

 Kaul Singh said Jammu and Kasmir police had entered up to 15 km inside the Lahaul-Spiti district and claimed the territory as their own. He added that ITBP forces patrolling the boundaries between the two states had been withdrawn and needed to be redeployed in adequate number to thwart any untoward incident. He said that governments of all states should accord high importance for amicable resolution.
 
 The boundary dispute was brought to the notice of the government by Lahaul-Spiti MLA Ravi Thakur. He pointed out that at Sarchu and Shinkula, people from Ladakh and Zanskar regions had encroached deep inside the territory of Himachal Pradesh in Lahaul-Spiti district.
 
 He has been persuading the government, revenue and home departments to take necessary steps for the last three years, but to no avail. He said that National Commission for Scheduled Tribes had also intervened in the dispute. He said issue needs to be resolved at the earliest to protect the sanctity of stateâ€™s boundary. According to him, last year August a team of officials from Survey of India visited Sarchu and Shinkula and had spoken about the exact boundary in the presence of officials from Lahaul-Spiti district administration and Leh district administration. The proposal of the Survey of India to demarcate the boundary has not been met with yet.
