BHUBANESWAR: The state government has taken an initiative to rescue   lobourers, who are allegedly harassed by locals in Kozhikode district of Kerala. The labourers were also asked by the locals to leave the locality immediately.   minister Prafulla Kumar Mallik said he has information about the issue in Kerala. "I have directed our labour commissioner Roopa Mishra to stay in touch with the   government and talk with their officers to bring our people back home safely." 

 The matter came to light after the labourers staying at Mangaon in Kozhikode district appealed to the Odisha government for help through a video on Saturday. "Locals are not happy with us because they feel that outsiders have hijacked their jobs. An altercation ensued and they threatened us to leave the place," said Rahul  , 30, a mason by profession. 
 
 Behera, who hails from Haripur under Aska police limits in Ganjam district, said he has been staying at Mangaon for last one year. "Like me around 100 Odias from Khurda, Nayagarh, Ganjam, Puri and other parts of the state are staying here. We work as daily labourers in Kozhikode to eke out a living," he added. 
 
 Anand Dalbehera, another Odia from Khurda, said some local people have been scolding them for last few days. Scared landlords don't allow them to stay in their houses. Police have put up notices on the walls not to use the houses, he added. "We spent the Saturday night under the open sky. We are scared of the local people. So we request our state government to help us," said Sudarshan Sahu, another labourer. "Because we don't get employment in Odisha, we come here in search of work. We dont harm anybody here. But locals are threatening us to leave the place. We are in a miserable condition," said the labourers in the video.
