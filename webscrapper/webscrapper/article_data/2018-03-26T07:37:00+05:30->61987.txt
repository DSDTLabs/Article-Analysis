SHIMLA: Ten years after its construction started, a road which passes through the apple belt of Shimla and had become a major poll issue in the area in the 2017 assembly elections is nering completion. 

 Acording to chief minister Jair Ram Thakur’s written reply to a question during the ongoing budget session, 90.34% of the 80km Theog-Kotkhai-Hatkoti-Rohru road has been completed. In all, the project missed four deadlines.
 
 Former CM   Dhumal-led BJP government started work on this ambitious road by awarding the project to a Chinese company in February 2008. Initially, the deadline was June 2011, but it was extended all these years. 
 
 In his reply, the CM said Rs 495.38 crore had been spent on the road project till February 15 this year.
 
 During the assembly elections last year, delay in completion of the road was a major issue in the three assembly constituencies of Theog, Jubbal-Kotkhai and  . BJP leaders had accused the then   government of failing to complete the road project in time.
 
 When it missed the June 2011 deadline, the Chinese company’s deadline had been extended to June 2013.
 
 After coming to power in 2012, chief minister Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government cancelled the contract given to the Chinese company after it failed to meet the 2013 deadline as well. The state government then awarded work to an Indian company with a new deadline of 2016, which was later extended to 2017 and now had been extended again.
 
 On seeing work on this ambitious road project progressing at a slow pace, the Himachal Pradesh high court in May 2015 constituted a committee of two members, including retired district and sessions judge B L   and retired chief engineer Arun Sharma, to monitor work.
