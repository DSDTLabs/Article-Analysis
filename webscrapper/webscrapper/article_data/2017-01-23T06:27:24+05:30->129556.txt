 "I wish I had been firm in saying there was no need for him to come. He would have been alive then," said Mita, who works as an assistant revenue inspector in the tehsil department at Golamunda.
 
 "When the accident occurred, I could not understand what to do. There was no light in our coach. Some passengers fell on top of my father. When people started moving, I discovered that my father was not responding to my calls," Mita said. Mita would then go on to make the telephone call to her mother, her two brothers and her grandfather Chandramani Rout, informing them of Binit's death.
