CHENNAI: The two major leisure spots within the city,   zoo and Children's Park, Guindy, attracted a larger crowd than previous years, during the December holidays.

 While the   in Vandalur witnessed 1.13 lakh visitors between December 25 last year and January 1 this year, the Children's Park saw a footfall of about 64,501 visitors. During the corresponding period last year, the total number of visitors to the zoo was only 75,167 and that of the Children's Park was around 18,998.
 
 Wildlife officials attributed the increase in the number of visitors during this year-end holidays to the nature's fury that wrecked havoc in the city over the last two years. While it was floods in 2015, which damaged the electrical supply system, water pipes and other amenities in the zoo and the park, the Cyclone Vardah in 2016 uprooted thousands of trees in both the places. Zoo director S   said, "We managed to recover from the damage caused by floods within a short period of time. However, the impact of the cyclone was so heavy, that it took months for us to recover from the calamity. Clearing uprooted trees and other debris was a major task, which consumed a lot of time."
 
 This year, with the completion of most restoration works, the zoo and the park were ready to receive visitors. In a huge step towards digitalisation, a new concept in the zoo this year round was the use of credit/debit card swipe machines to buy tickets. The move which came as a relief to many visitors, also reduced the time taken for returning petty change to the visitors, thereby reducing the workload on those manning the counters, Yuvaraj said.
 
 The zoo authorities are working on introducing online ticket booking from Pongal holidays. "This system is already being tested in the zoo. Once this comes into place, the waiting time to enter the zoo will come down drastically. We are also planning to have a green channel for those booking tickets online," he added.
