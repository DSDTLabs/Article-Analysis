ARA: Close on the heels of BJP’s Khatauli (UP) MLA Vikram Saini threatening to break the limbs of everyone who doesn’t consider cow to be a mother, party MP   on Sunday said he would thrash any person on the spot if s/he talked about the fragmentation of India.

 “Humlogon ka khoon aisa hain ki agar koi hamare samne Bharat ke tukde hone ka baat karega, toh usse hum wahin peetenge. Hamare hi nahi, balki aam Bharatiya ke samne koi aisa kahega, toh usse woh log wahin patak kar peetenge. Bolne ki azadi ka matlab desh ke khilaf bolna nahi hain (I will thrash anyone who talks about the fragmentation of India. Not only I, even common Indians will pin such people down and beat them up. Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom to speak against the country),” said the former Union home secretary, who represents Bihar’s Ara in the lok Sabha.
 
 The retired IAS official of Bihar cadre was in his parliamentary constituency on Sunday afternoon for inspection of a railway over bridge currently under construction.
 
 Asked by a journalist about the controversy over the elevation of Aditya Nath   as the UP chief minister, Singh said, “There are certain elements who have created the controversy. Common people have welcomed Yogi as the CM and applauded his government’s initial inititives to curb corruption and improve law and order.”
 
 The MP ridiculed those who believe that only those people are virtuous who do not believe in Hindutva. “However, they should know that Hindutva is one of the basic tenets of our life,” he said.
