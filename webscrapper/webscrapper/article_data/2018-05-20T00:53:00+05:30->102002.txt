Madurai: A group of youngsters who rescued an injured Russel’s viper in Madurai, were given permission by the forest department to take it to Sathyamangalam to treat its fractured spine. P R Vishwanath, R Saga Devan and J Samson Kirubakaran of ‘Urvanam’, an organisation, are known for their voluntary animal rescue operations in many parts of Madurai. On information, the team went to Thirunagar and spotted an injured Russel’s viper, which was not able to move. After informing the forest department they took it to the veterinary hospital at Tallakulam in Madurai. An X-ray revealed that its spine is fractured. The hospital has treated a python and a cobra earlier, but this is the first time that they are treating a Russel’s viper. Veterinary surgeon Dr N Selvarajulu, who was part of the team that examined in the animal, said that they had given it some anti-inflammatory medicines and antibiotics and asked the forest department to release it into the forest. “The spine seemed to have been damaged, but we did our best. It behaved very docile when the volunteers handled it, which was a surpris to us,’’ he said. District forest officer J R Samartha said that they had noticed that the reptile was not able to move the back portion of its body. So we decided to take to Sathyamangalam, where Dr Ashok, an expert in treating injured snakes, will have a look at it. “The volunteers have been asked to transport it carefully without exposing it to light, which could excite the animal and cause more harm due to movement,’’ he said. For Vishwanath and his friends it is just another day, as they are doing their best for one of the hundred snakes they have rescued. They said they are grateful to the forest department for helping them and encouraging them.
