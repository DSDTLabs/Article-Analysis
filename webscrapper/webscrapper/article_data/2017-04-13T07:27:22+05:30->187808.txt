JAIPUR: Parents and schools at loggerheads over hike in   has almost become an annual custom at this time of the year. A delay in implementation of newly passed   Private Schools Fees Act has given a window to private schools to increase the fees with a fair percentage fuming parents. 

 Sunita  , a mother of two children whose sons study in a school near   police station was shocked to receive a letter from the school informing about the rise in fees. “My wards fees have increased from Rs 53775 to Rs 65500 for half yearly which is way more than rate of inflation. I questioned school and they fail to give a convincing answer. This is injustice and I am meeting some parents to raise this issue before the government,” said Kapoor.
 
 Some parents have formed groups on whatsapp to plan their strategy against fees hike. They are reaching out political leaders to help them in rolling fees. “The school where my kids study doesn’t have a parent association. It is reason that hike in fees always goes unchecked,” said  , a parent whose daughter studies in a school close to Statue Circle. Many schools have shot up the fees upto 25% leaving parents jittery. A study by localcircles.com -- an online network states that over 75% parents in Rajasthan have reported to have said that fees have increased.
 
 State education department has passed a new act which will be in effect from year 2018-19. The fees of every school will be decided by a ten-member committee including five parents, three teachers and two representatives from the school administration. The committee will be bound by the law to propose the fee hike in proportion to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For increasing fees beyond the CPI, schools have to justify the hike to the committee.
