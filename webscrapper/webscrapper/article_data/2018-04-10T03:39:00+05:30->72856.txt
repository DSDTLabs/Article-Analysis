Nagpur: Mahatransco seems to be throwing rules into the dustbin to favour its contractors. In a shocking case, a superintending engineer ‘illegally’ split a road construction tender to please two contractors who had quoted the same price. The matter is now being investigated by vigilance wing of the company. Gulabrao Uke, general secretary of Power Front, told TOI that superintending engineer (civil) SR Hake and executive engineer DJ Uikey had floated a tender for construction of a road from Uppalwadi Naka to Uppalwadi 132 KV substation in 2017. The cost of the work was Rs78.39 lakh. Two companies MK Builders and SR Enterprises, both bid 4.95% above the estimate. “Instead of calling the two firms for negotiations to reduce their price, Hake split the tender into two parts of equal cost of Rs41.13 lakh. There is no such provision in GOII/Account Volume of Mahatransco for such splitting. One company was given the work of constructing the water bound Macadam (WBM) road while other was asked to asphalt it,” Uke said. The union leader lodged a complaint with Mahatransco chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Rajeev Kumar Mittal about this irregularity. Nagpur chief engineer Vikas Bade then forwarded the case to the company’s vigilance wing. Bade, however, told TOI that there was nothing wrong in splitting a tender. Uke questioned the cost quoted by the two contractors. “Tenders of road works floated by several agencies like Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), public works department (PWD), Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), etc have been awarded at less than the estimate. How come Mahatransco road works were awarded at 4.95%? Why didn’t Hake and Uikey call the contractors for negotiations and ask them the basis for quoting above the estimate” he said. He also alleged that quality of road work was also not satisfactory. “The contractors are not using the standard procedure for building the road,” he claimed.
