NEW DELHI:   Rail Corporation will soon introduce air-conditioned feeder buses on 52 different routes from its different stations in a major revamp of its feeder bus network. A presentation was made by   on Wednesday at the meeting of the state transport authority, which would grant permit to run these buses.

 The buses would be run on a cluster system, under which bus operators would be paid per kilometre for plying them. They would also have no conductors and the entry would be through Delhi Metro travel smart cards, which would ensure that only metro users travel in these buses.
 
 “DMRC plans to operate 16-seater buses, which would be seven metres-long,” said STA board member Madan Lal.
 
 Lal said that the 52 routes will be divided between five different clusters. “DMRC would ensure that there is no concentration of too many buses at any particular metro station, so there is no congestion,” he said. Initially, DMRC would procure CNG-run buses and later shift to electric feeder buses.
 
 At present, DMRC’s feeder bus services are rickety and 269 in number, which is way short of the demand. The corporation has been planning a major revamp of its feeder network to provide more efficient and comfortable last mile connectivity.
 
 DMRC has been demanding that the routes of its feeder buses should be shorter. At present, most of the routes are too long and are therefore used by many non-metro commuters. In its presentation, DMRC has asked for routes that are not longer than five to six kilometres, Lal said.
