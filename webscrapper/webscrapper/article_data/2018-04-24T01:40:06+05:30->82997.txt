NEW DELHI: Siddhartha Vashishta Charitable Trust, an NGO run by  , claims to have sponsored the study expenses of around 700 children who are kin of  . While in jail, Sharma identified the potential convicts whose children needed help and passed on the details to the NGO, which took up the cases. 

 Kanupriya Mehta, the  , told TOI in detail about the initiatives of Sharma and his team. “The idea to set up an NGO to help children of the community was taken up after we found that a lot of convicts serving life sentences were the sole breadwinners for their families. There are a lot of NGOs working for them inside the jail but we felt that some one should also take care of the families who are outside but are suffering the punishment too,” said Mehta, adding that 15 inmates who were released from jail were also rehabilitated by the NGO.
 
 Mehta said that Sharma was the contact person for the NGO inside jail. Any convict who wanted the NGO to take care of his/her children had to approach Sharma and fill in the details of family members on a form. Sharma would later hand it over to Mehta when she would meet him in jail. 
 
 The NGO then contacted the family, counselled the children and then admitted them in schools with which the NGO has a tie-up. Mehta said the NGO has been running for the past eight years. 
 
 Mehta also said that Sharma was moved by the condition of the family members of the convicts and decided to use his contacts outside jail to look after them. “He had met us a few times while he was out on parole,” she added.
 
 At present, the NGO has four employees who coordinate with some schools in west and east Delhi to admit children suffering from disabilities. Some programmes organised by the NGO have been attended by senior political leaders and former top cops.
