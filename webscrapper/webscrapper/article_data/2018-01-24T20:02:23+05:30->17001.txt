A grand show by Meera and   was a befitting finale to the spectacular three-day Dream   Fashion Week. The show began with a dance performance on In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke by Shivani Verma and what set the mood of the show were more ghazals like 'Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein Laati Hai Hamein' playing in the background. From anarkalis paired with farshi pyjamas to lehengas in Banarasi brocade, velvet, everything that was put on the ramp had a touch of Meera and Muzaffar Ali’s signature style. "We have been working on this for a long time since it takes a lot of time to put together so many looks and each one of them had its own story, its own detailing. We used a lot of brocades which we specially got woven in Banaras. Each piece was one of its kind. These are not the designs you would find two people wearing in any party or a wedding," said Meera. "We have used hand woven textiles from Bhagalpur and Banaras, so there is a lot of convergence of hand woven fabrics," added Muzaffar.

 Joining them on the ramp was Meera and Muzaffar's daughter Sama Ali, who is now working with her parents to take the design legacy forward. "My mother and I sit and set the designs together and it is perhaps one of the few things we two agree on," said Sama. Vartika Singh, Femina Miss Grand India 2015, concluded the show in a heavily embroidered lehenga that was the highlight of the show.
 
 
 With traditional instrumental music playing in the background, designer Nikita Nayak showcased yet another bridal collection on the runway. The collection was fit for a bride who wants a traditional look, but in not-so-traditional colours. Hand-painted patterns and embroidery were the highlight on fabrics like Banarasi, net, organza and chiffon. For men, there were front open long jackets paired with dhoti. “My collection is mostly Indo-Western and I have used my traditional hand painting on the garments. There is a range of ethnic fabrics used in the collection along with textiles and fabrics from Odisha. My traditional hand painting is inspired from pattachitra and the handloom fabric used is pochampalli ikat,”said Nikita, who showcased on the ramp for the first time. "I was anxious as this was my first show, but everything was superbly organised. I am glad I got this experience of showcasing at Delhi Times Fashion Week," said the designer.

 Designer Sulakshana Monga has been working on a bridal wear that suits the choices of modern brides. The designer added a few more designs to that and kept in mind that colours and embroidery should be subtle. Without adding bling to her collection, Sulakshana worked on a line that used small, but intricate embroidery patterns. The show began with the presentation of pastle shades like pale pink and shades of mustard and the final part of the show had models walking in traditional red lehenga with embroidered motifs inspired from Mughal India. The designer said that the idea of the collection was "to present the new India."

 She added, "There was heritage, tradition and art in this collection, but we did experiment with drapes to present the traditional in a new look. Mughal motifs and images from miniature paintings were used as an inspiration for this line." The designer was happy to be at Delhi Times Fashion Week and said that "this has been one great collaboration and what I like the best about Delhi Times Fashion Week is that it is giving a platform to young, budding designers." Sana Dua, fbb Colors Femina Miss United Continents India 2017, was the showstopper for Sulakshana’s show.

 To get an opportunity to showcase their creations and also walk the ramp sure was an exciting thing for the students of Footwear Design & Development Institute. Thirty nine students of the institute walked the ramp and showcased five collections on the day three of Dream Diamonds  . The show began with some concept designs exploring different geometrical shapes and first few garments were all in shimmering silver. Then came some colour on the ramp. Suede and leather skirts and pants, muted embroidery and fabrics that were created to give structure and strong silhouette to designs were part of the collection. Students said that months of hard work went into creation of garments and each had rehearsed well before their final appearance on the ramp. The showstopper for the show was Shraddha Shashidhar, Yamaha Fascino Miss Diva Universe 2017.

 With pants and pyjamas with skirt-like drapes, short kurtas with dhoti pants, kurtas with drape over shoulders, Suvigya Sharma and Kalash Parmani’s menswear collection left many stunned. The designer duo’s collection was a departure from conventional forms and shapes and designs in menswear. The Jaipur-based designers told us that the collection was called Fusion Life. Being an artist himself, Kalash said that all the prints that appeared on the garments were actually hand-painted and were inspired from his artworks.

 He said, "For the print, we used 24 carat gold, so there's real gold used on the fabric for this collection. Our idea was to merge Indian and contemporary. We did a lot of biker jackets and paired them with Jodhpurs to create a different look. Though we have used real gold, we wanted to keep the look subtle and simple. Nothing is over the top in the collection." The designers were thrilled to receive some compliments for "an unusual collection for men."
 
  "This has been a great show and we feel honoured to be here," said Kalash.
 
 
 Designers Rohit Gandhi and  's collection on the last day of the Dream Diamonds Delhi Times Fashion Week stood out for its interesting presentation and chic cocktail dresses in monochromes. While for women, there were gowns and cocktail dresses with a lot of sequins, there were tuxedos and structured jackets for men. "The collection was not just about beautiful gowns for women, it had some very glam options for men too," said Rahul, adding, "We showcased a festive collection, which had a lot of metallic and black. We have been doing fashion weeks for 20 years now, but putting up a show is still nerve-racking. Doing this show was very exciting for us. It's a great initiative which brings together talent in fashion. We need more platforms like this."
