Guntur: An APSRTC driver died of a cardiac arrest while on the wheel at Chintapalle near Karampudi in Guntur district on Wednesday. 

 The bus, with 22 passengers on board, went off the road and hit a tamarind tree after the driver collapsed. Around 12 passengers reportedly sustained minor injuries. 
 
 The 40-year-old driver, Syed Taj Baba, is survived by wife and three daughters. 
 
 He had come to Macherla from Narasaraopet for the education of his wards. 
 
 He was working as a driver in Piduguralla depot for the last four years after his job had been regularised.
 
 The bus started from Piduguralla to Karampudi at 8.50 am, while the accident took place almost after an hour on the outskirts of Chintapalle.
 
 Taj Baba, who did not have any health issue earlier, was driving at a moderate speed. The conductor of the bus noticed that the vehicle was veering off to the left with the driver being unable to move.
 
 On reaching the spot, Karampudi sub-inspector, Mannam Murali, rushed the injured to a government hospital, while the driver passed away on the spot. 
 
 One of his colleagues, SK Dastagiri, said that Taj Babaâ€™s death shocked him as he was in good health.
 
 Taj Baba drove left to stop the bus as he was not in a position to slam the brakes, said the Piduguralla depot manager, N Moshe.
