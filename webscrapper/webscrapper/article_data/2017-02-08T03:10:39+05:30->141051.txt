NAVI MUMBAI: Around 600 dozens of   from Dapoli, Deogad and Ratnagiri arrived at   APMC on Monday and Tuesday.

 Several   from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane participated in the auction process at the   and the   of the premium Alphonso mangoes were sold at a   of Rs 1,500-1,800 a dozen. Traders are anticipating increased supplies by the end of this month, which will help curb prices too. 
 
 “On Monday, Dapoli farmer Fazalseth Rakhaj brought in the first lot of 12 dozen Alphonso mangoes and dold them to Navi Mumbai retailer Prakash Disle at Rs 1,500 per dozen,” said Dinkar Mahabale, a trader at APMC. “It was a surprise catch that hit Mumbai market early in February rather than the mid-February slot,” he added.
 
 Traders said that the mango crop is showing positive signs of good harvest due to a balanced monsoon and the conducive climate so far. “The extended winter delayed the harvest by a fortnight. But the rates are expected to be cheaper than last season, when supplies peak in March and April,” said market expert Tarun Surve. 
 
 The next few days will see a steady supply of the fruit only to pick up by this month end, said traders. Exporters are yet to start transactions as the supply is still less. 
 
 “Though Alphonso mangoes are not yet in the reach of the common man, the fruit will become cheaper gradually. With bumper supplies expecting in March, the rates will be quite affordable then,” predicted Mihir Sonawane, a retailer from Mumbai.
