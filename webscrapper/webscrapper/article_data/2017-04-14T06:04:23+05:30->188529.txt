 PUNE: The state government on Wednesday announced that a four-member   (SIT) will probe allegations of misconduct against   institutions.
 
 It has been alleged that the companies are charging exorbitant rates from women members of self-help groups, and employing criminal elements for forcible recovery of dues.
 
 The government had promised to form an SIT in the winter session of the state assembly last December.
 
 The state home department, in its order dated April 12, said the Nagpur divisional commissioner will head the SIT, which will also comprise a member each from the state cooperative department, rural development department and women’s economic development corporation.
 
 The committee will probe loans given by micro-finance companies across the state, with special focus on Nagpur and Amravati districts, and submit the report to the government within 60 days. Micro-finance institutions deemed guilty be named in the report, which will also suggest solutions. The SIT will interview officers and employees of the institutions, and also travel across the state.
 
 “These companies are charging 14-30% interest on loans. It has been observed that these companies are threatening, putting pressure, abusing men and women to recover loans. Cases have been registered in Amravati and Nagpur districts in this regard,” states the government order.
 
 There was heated debate on this issue in the assembly during the winter session, when   had moved a calling-attention motion. 
 
 Members had also drawn the government’s attention to suicide attempts by women members of self-help groups. Micro-finance companies function under a licence, under Section 58 of the   Act. Members have pushed for an SIT, saying the matter will turn serious if beleaguered members of self-help groups start taking extreme steps to avoid harassment.
