AHMEDABAD: More than three months after Vijay Rupani’s Gujarat government announced subsidized meals, for Rs 10, for labourers, this scheme is still on the backburner.

 Dr Anil Patel, chiarman of Gujarat Bandhkam Shramyogi Kalyan Board (GBSKB), said on Tuesday that the state government has been mulling on starting the scheme but nothing has been finalized at present. Patel was speaking to reporters about the achievements of ‘Dhanvantari Arogya Ratha’ – an ambulance service for constructions workers, which began operations on December 25 last year.
 
 On whether the tender procedure has begun, Patel said the scheme will be started in the near future but he did say by when subsidized food would reach labourers in the state. It needs mention that the BJP-led Rajasthan government and the AIADMK-led Tamil Nadu government have already started subsidized meals for the poor.
 
 Patel on September 22 had said that construction workers would receive a packed lunch of dal, subzi, roti and chutni at Rs 10 per meal. “We have tied up with Akshay Patra. Each meal costs Rs 42.50. The workers will pay Rs 10 and the government will pay the rest,” Patel had said.
 
 About other initiatives of GBKSB, Patel said the state government will give portable tents to labourers employed in construction work on canals across the state.
 
 He also said that labourers will be trained in digital transactions with a view of demonetization.
 
 Patel said the board has been making efforts to give medical facilities to labourers, because the government believes that treatment of any ailing labourer should not be hampered for lack of money.
 
 Patel announced that the board would give stipends of Rs 1,500 per month to workers who have become 90% disabled at construction sites.
 
 He claimed that the number of registered labourers in the state increased from 47,000 in 2014 to 4.54 lakh in 2016.
