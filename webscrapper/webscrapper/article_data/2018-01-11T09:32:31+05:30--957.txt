SURAT: The National Green Tribunalâ€™s (NGT)   has set aside   (EC) issued to   (HCC) based at Hasanabad in   for expansion of its manufacturing unit for production of sodium cyanide and mandalo nitride. 

 The Khedut Samaj Gujarat (KSG), Priyavaran Suraksha Samiti and the Brackish Water Research had challenged the EC to HCC in the NGT on January 22, 2016. 
 
 They had argued that EC was granted to the company by ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) without considering the expert appraisal committee (EAC) recommendation on the outcome of public consultation and public hearing held on November 14, 2014. Further, they had alleged that the effluent released by the company was causing severe land and water pollution in nearby villages.
 
 The judgement published on January 7 observed that HCC was granted environment clearance by the MoEF on July 23, 2017, for the expansion of its manufacturing activity by permitting the production of 25 million tonnes per annum (MTA) of sodium cyanide and 45 MTA of mandalo nitride without following the environment impact assessment (EIA) notification, 1994. 
 
 According to the petitioners, the manufacturing unit was not located in the notified industrial area of Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) Olpaad and the product being manufactured was classified under A-category, which requires to go through the stages of EIA and public hearing and consultation before EC can be granted. 
 
 The GIDC has clearly revealed in its letter on August 24, 2014, that the Olpaad Industrial Estate, where the company is located, is not declared as notified industrial area. 
 
 The counsel who appeared on behalf of the petitioners submitted that the EC to the company be set aside and the case be send back to the expert appraisal committee in order to consider the public concerns expressed during public hearing held on November 14, 2014.
 
 The NGT has directed the EAC of the MoEF to consider the outcome of public consultation along with suggestions, objections, documents raised by the other stakeholders.
