CHENNAI: People planning summer holidays in Southeast Asian destinations may have to spend more as air fares have increased due to a shortage in the number of flights.

  has cancelled its daily service between Chennai and Singapore and moved it to Bengaluru while Thai AirAsia and Malindo Air have cut their frequencies from Trichy to Kuala Lumpur. The airlines were also catering to passengers headed to Singapore as the services were positioned in such a way that passengers got convenient connection from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore or Bangkok. 
 
  
  
 
 Sources said unfair competition and predatory pricing of tickets among the carriers to garner maximum passengers on the Chennai-Singapore route has lead to Jet Airways withdrawing from Chennai.
 
 An airport offiial said, "There was fierce competition between Scoot,  , IndiGo and   who operate direct flights forcing the airlines to sell one-way tickets at Rs6,000 while it should have been sold at Rs8,000. This has lead to reduction in load factor in some of the services. The frequency is also high because Singapore is the most popular foreign destination from Chennai." 
 
 An airline official said operators have the most number of flights between Singapore and Chennai because the city ranks second in generating tourists to the city-state. The number of flights to Singapore is higher because most of the airlines connected Chennai with Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok via Singapore with an offer of one day's halt for sightseeing. 
 
 On the Chennai-Bangkok route there are only two direct flights in a day - a Thai AirAsia flight and a   flight - which has caused the fare to go up for summer holidays. Fares on flights that flies via Kuala Lumpur and Singapore is expensive and layover time is more than two hours at the transit airport. Though the demand is high, Indian airlines are not starting services on the route probably because there is no business class interest.
