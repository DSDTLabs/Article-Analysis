NEW DELHI: After the   of  , it’s not business as usual at  . With security personnel deployed everywhere, shopkeepers complain of losing business.

 Over 100 CRPF and Delhi Police personnel are deployed on the street opposite a blind school where the incident had occurred. “Our movements are restricted due to the police presence since they occasionally block lanes for VVIP visit or when they sense trouble. We wish things returned to normal soon,” said Pooran Chand who runs a food stall. 
 
 Police said forces would be removed gradually when the situation normalises. But police presence has been beefed up at some pockets where police suspect trouble could break out due to their demographic profiles. 
 
 “We are either being asked to close shop before schedule or are stopped from even assembling for a chat. The situation can be diffused if we sit together and decide on maintaining peace,” said Mohammad Asgar, a resident of Khyala village who had stopped by for prayers at a local mosque. 
 
 But police are still not taking any chances as emotions are still running high among some people in both the colonies. 
 
 Some of the women at B block voiced their anger over the situation. “Whatever has happened is utterly wrong but holding the area hostage by threatening to hold protests would not bring him back,” said Bhawna, a homemaker and a neighbour of the accused. 
 
 There are also some who have been helping the security personnel. Workers at a food stall outside the victim’s house have been serving them water and tea. “I have seen some of them standing for hours. I feel bad at times. We are offering them tea and snacks, and chatting with them to keep them in high spirits,” said eatery owner Rakesh Singh (36).
