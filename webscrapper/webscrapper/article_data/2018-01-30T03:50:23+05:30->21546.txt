MUMBAI: Two   cousins, one of them employed at a jewellery store in Malad (E), were arrested for stealing cash and gold worth Rs 43 lakh from the store recently. Both the accused, aged 17, were nabbed from Rajasthan and brought to Mumbai, where they have been sent to the Dongri observation home.

 The theft was reported at Rooplaxmi   at Santosh Nagar on January 21. The store owner, Khalilal Kothari, had hired one of them from his hometown in Rajasthan three months back. He trusted the teen and gave him accommodation at his residence. While working at the shop, the teen figured out that the   cameras were not functioning. He also found out where Kothari kept the store keys at his house.
 
 After Kothari locked up the shop and went home to rest in the afternoon, the teen pocketed the keys from his house on January 21. He then met his cousin, who he had contacted earlier, at the shop. The two emptied the store of gold jewellery and cash. They then left for Rajasthan by road and kept changing vehicles to throw anyone chasing them off track.
 
 After Kothari lodged a police complaint, the cops used technical surveillance to track down the duo to Rajasthan. They had apparently called a friend in Rajasthan 36 times. The two were nabbed from a guest house where they were hiding and the entire   was recovered from them, police said. During questioning, the duo told police that they had planned to start their own jewellery business with the loot.
 
 The accused have been booked under sections 381 (theft by servant) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
 Dindoshi police have appealed to jewellers to run background checks before hiring employees. “Jewellers also need to ensure that the electronic surveillance systems at their establishments are functioning properly,” said senior inspector Rajaram Vanmane.
