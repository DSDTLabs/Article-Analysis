TUMAKURU: Two farmers were   at   district on Monday.

 Giriyappa, 55, and Nagaraju, 45, were grazing their cattle on the outskirts of the village when the elephant attacked them, forest department officials said. When the duo failed to reach home, their children launched a search and found them dead.
 
 District forest officer Chakrapani said wild elephants have been staying at Gubbi tank for the past one week. “On Sunday night, they moved towards Sorakayeepete. Despite our warming, villagers came out. The herd has now split into two groups,” he added.
 
 Rangappa, a villager, said elephants have damaged their agriculture crops several times in the past. “We haven’t got any compensation. Our complaints to officials and politicians for a permanent solution have yieled no results. They visit the village only when accidents happen,” he rued.
 
 The officials handed over a cheque of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of the deceased.
