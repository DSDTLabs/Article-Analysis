JAISALMER: New Year couldn’t have begun on a better note for this elderly couple who found their son after 25 long years. Their son, Heera, reached the village here from here, it was indeed a joyous day for the entire village. People reached the couple’s home and exchanged sweets.

 In 1993, Heera, son of one Harjiram Jat (resident of   of   in Dhorimanna area) went missing from home. He had failed in class IX which left him depressed and out of guilt he left home without telling anyone. His family members kept waiting but there was no sign of Heera. Heera, meanwhile, reached Jalandhar and started working there as a labourer. After some time he married Rinki. While working there he opened a provision shop and later he bought a plot and built a house. Heera has two children, a son called Major Singh and daughter Gurpreet who are studying there. Heera was busy with work and family and never thought of coming home.
 
 His wife kept asking him to visit his home but he always refused. Rinki told him that her brother too went missing and her parents were leading a dejected life. So his parents too must be disappointed and dejected.
 
 Heera then agreed and sent his wife and children first to his home to talk to his parents. He said he would join them later. Rinki and the children reached Heera’s home on December 29 but his parents did not allow them inside. Seeing the commotion , villagers too gathered there. Rinki then showed them Heera’s photo and asked his parents to speak to him on the phone. Heera’s parents became emotional after talking to Heera after 25 years.
 
 Finally Heera reached his village on Saturday and the entire family welcomed him at the station. Heera’s mother Rajjo Devi could not control her tears while for Harjiram (70) it was the best gift he could ever ask for. Harjiram said he kept waiting for 25 years and his son coming back is really fortunate. His mother said she had never left hope of her son returning home.
