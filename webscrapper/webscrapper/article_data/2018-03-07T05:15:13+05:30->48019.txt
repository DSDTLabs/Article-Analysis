GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority ( ) on Tuesday threatened to cancel the allotment of 100 acres of   belonging to BSP chief Mayawati’s Bahujan Prerna Trust for non-payment of dues amounting to over Rs 110 crore.

 According to YEIDA, the land was originally allotted to Real Estate Development Company in 2011 for institutional purpose in Sector 26B. The company, which initially paid 10% (Rs 9.46 crore) towards allotment cost, transferred the land to   two months later. But the trust has still not been able to pay the balance of Rs 112 crore.
 
 “We will soon issue a final notice asking the land owner to pay up or face cancellation of allotment. In case of non-payment, we will issue orders for cancellation in the next few days,” Arunvir Singh, CEO of YEIDA, told TOI. “In 2011, the allottee transferred the land to Bahujan Prerna Trust. But the trust has not built any structure on the ground yet.” 
 
 This is not the first time that YEIDA has raised the issue. “On April 6, 2017, we issued a notice to the trust asking them to deposit the money with YEIDA or face cancellation of plot allotment. A month prior to that also, we had issued a notice asking the trust to pay up,” Singh said.
 
 However, after the two notices last year, the trust had approached the Allahabad high court for reprieve, claiming that YEIDA failed to give them possession of the said land and hence no construction could be carried out.
 
 “The court had then stayed any cancellation of the allotment and instead directed the manager, institution of YEIDA, to dispose of the petitioner’s representation. On Tuesday, we disposed of the matter. An investigation has revealed that 66,000 square metres of the 100 acres was encroached and YEIDA could not give possession of it to the allottee. But the allottee has failed to construct any building on the rest of the land,” Singh explained.
 
 The trust’s in-charge in Delhi, Manish Kumar, could not be contacted.
