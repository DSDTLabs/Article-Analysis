COIMBATORE: State commercial taxes department minister K C   justified the hike in value added tax (VAT) levied on petrol and diesel in   imposed on Saturday.

 Talking to reporters in Coimbatore on Monday on the sidelines of a review meeting on commercial taxes collection, Veeramani said the price of petrol and diesel was far less than several states in the country even after the hike.
 
 The hike in VAT for petrol from 27% to 34% and for die sel from 21.4 % to 25 % by the state government which resulted in a steep rise in fuel prices has come in for severe criticism from political parties as well as public.
 
 “For a long time we have not hiked VAT in Tamil Nadu. Even after the hike, VAT is Rs 1 lesser for petrol and diesel or in case of few other states, Tamil Nadu VAT rates are lesser by up to Rs 2,'' he said.
 
 The VAT has been hiked in a bid to increase the revenue reserves of the government, he said.
 
 Though there was wide spread demand from various quarters for a rollback, the minister's response justifying the rise indicated that the government was not looking at a price reversal, at least for now.
 
 Earlier at the review meeting held at the collectorate, Veeramani said there was steady rise in commercial taxes collection in the state. In the financial year 2016 ­ 17, a sum of Rs 3,667 crore has been collected as commercial taxes till January this year as against Rs 3,189 crore collected during the same period in 2015-16. "We have collected Rs 478 crore more this year, which is a rise of 15 %,'' he said.
 
 Commercial taxes collection has not just been crucial but also the primary source for implementation of the welfare schemes of the state government, he said.
 
 He told officials to crack the whip on defaulters and tax evaders to further increase tax collection.
 
 “Take stern action on evaders. Also examine the loopholes and areas that show poor growth and fix them immediately,'' he told the officials.
