TIRUVANNAMALAI: For a change, the roles were reversed for a short period or to say, the shoe was on the other foot.

 Two class IX students turned teachers, while   V Jayakumar and   K S Kandasamy became students in a class.
 
 Kandasamy and Jayakumar joined 20-odd students of the panchayat elementary school at Vengikal and attended a 45-minute class on environment taken by two class IX students recently. 
 
 Vaishnavi and her classmate Pooja, students of the Path Global Public School at Malappambadi village near Tiruvannamalai town, wrote a letter to the collector on January 31 stating that they want to serve the society and the country.
 
 “I wanted to showcase such students to the society and bring positive changes among other students. I wanted them to inspire their peers. They also aim to create a world for their age group that is eco-friendly and inculcate social responsibility,” said the collector.
 
 The collector invited the students to take a class for the students at the primary section on various issues and create awareness.
 
 “We want to meet the collector and express our idea of ‘each one-teach one’. We also wanted to prove the power of students in giving shape to the dream of Dr A P J Abdul Kalam,” said C Pooja, who has been taking classes for children of her neighbours on the importance of environment and education for the last two months.
 
 Her classmate S Vaishnavi too has been taking such classes during her free time as well.
 
 “The collector invited me to his office and honoured me by making me sit on his chair on February 1. It was a wonderful experience,” said Pooja.
 
 The two girls spoke vividly on the importance of creating an environment-friendly atmosphere, creating awareness on education and social responsibility of each student. “We want to take the message to our peers and younger children to build a healthy society and also inculcate that each one should teach one,” she added.
