BENGALURU: A city-based   activist has filed a complaint with the Lokayukta, accusing senior government officials of apathy in acting against offenders who are   that grow by the roadside. 

 Sayidatta filed a complaint against the additional chief secretary, commissioners of   and BDA, and police superintendent, Bengaluru Rural for dereliction of duty.
 
 " Over 30 trees on the Outer Ring Roads of   and KR Puram have been injected with acid. This is the handiwork of the advertisement mafia who want to kill trees so that they can erect hoardings," Sayidatta said in his complaint. 
 
  "I noticed over 15 trees were axed in different parts of city, including Jayanagar, Cauvery Junction and Palace Road. Miscreants are cutting them to install hoardings. I met the mayor on January 13 to complain about it, but no action was taken," Police, BBMP and BDA officials are aware of this, but have turned a blind eye," he added.
