PORVORIM: PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’   has said that it will be “impossible” for Goa to get a relaxation in timing for sound permission for weddings and other traditional events.

 Dhavalikar’s reply came after   tabled the question, asking the government to exempt or relax the timing of sound permission for weddings and other traditional events unique to Goa.
 
 Alemao made a fervent request to relook at the legislation considering Goa’s unique culture. “The standards applicable to other states can’t be applied to Goa in totality,” he said.
 
 Dhavalikar replied that it being a central legislation, getting an exemption would be impossible. The time limit of sound for traditional weddings cannot be changed. Goa government has made public, a list of 15 days wherein relaxation is granted on use of loudspeakers, public address systems and sound-producing instruments beyond 10pm at night, he said.
 
 Section 5 of the Noise Pollution (Control and Regulation) Rules under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, lays down the restrictions on the use of loud sounds beyond 10pm at night. “Nothing more is possible,” the PWD minister told the House.
