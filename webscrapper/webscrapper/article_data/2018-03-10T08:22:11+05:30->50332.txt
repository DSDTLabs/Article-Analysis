 After realizing that excess land had been acquired, KIADB, instead of giving it back to the owners, allotted 43 acres to Infosys, 12 acres to Deshpande Foundation and 2 acres to   to build a hotel.

 He said an inquiry into irregularities to the tune of Rs 3.2 crore in implementation of Ravuthanahalli minor irrigation project in   is on since 1994. "Officials could not trace the addresses of staffers involved though they have been getting pension every month," he added. tnn
