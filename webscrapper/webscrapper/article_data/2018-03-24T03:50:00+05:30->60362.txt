Ahmedabad: After the arrests of two persons, including Sudhir Baghel in connection with the   of Rs 98 lakh cash, city police are inching closer to getting custody of Mukesh Yadav alias Fauji, considered the mastermind of the heist. Interestingly, it is not Vastrapur police but a team from DCP Zone I that will go to Uttar Pradesh (UP) to secure custody of Fauji. While cops are tight-lipped about developments, sources said Fauji was found not to have possession of the money.

 On February 23, Baghel, a van driver for a cash logistics firm, drugged two cash handlers and a gunman near Rajpath Club and made off with a chest containing cash meant for ATMs. 
 
 City crime branch arrested Baghel from UP and handed him over to Vastrapur police. Baghel in his questioning pointed at Fauji as the person who betrayed him and fled with most of the cash.
 
 While Divya Mishra, DCP Zone I, did not respond to calls, sources privy to the development said a team from Zone I was asked to go and get Fauji to the city instead of Vastrapur police after he was apprehended by UP police. No team, however, was sent as of Friday evening, as preliminary reports were not encouraging. tnn
