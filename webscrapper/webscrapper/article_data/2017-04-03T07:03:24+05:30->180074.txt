Gurgaon: The newly-installed   at   station, the city’s first, is generating a good response since its launch on Saturday. 

 With a capacity of over 2,000 litres, water here is being sold at Rs 5 per litre without bottle and Rs 10 per litre with bottle. The ATM, set up as a pilot project, remains open from 10am to 5pm, and has sold more than 150 litres of water on the first day. Reportedly, the water goes through seven stages of filtration at the kiosk.
 
 MCG, along with  , has undertaken this initiative with an objective of providing affordable filtered drinking water to residents, especially during summer. Interestingly, the staff hired to dispense filtered water at the ATM are deaf and mute youths. 
 
 “We’re looking to provide a cheaper alternative to branded bottled water. The kiosk has been stationed at   station, keeping in mind the high footfall at the premises. Water ATMs could be a feasible alternative at places where water pipeline cannot reach. The experiment will give us an insight if the model can be replicated in slum areas,” said MCG commissioner Uma Shankar.
 
 While the civic body provided land and permission to set up the kiosk, NGO Uthaan and Fluor, a private company, pooled in Rs 6.5 lakh to make the project a reality. “The idea is not just to provide filtered water, but to do so at a price much lower than what is available in the market,” said Sanjay Kaushik of Uthaan.
