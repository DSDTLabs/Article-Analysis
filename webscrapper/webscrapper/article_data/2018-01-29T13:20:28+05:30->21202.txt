KOZHIKODE: The Rural police is planing to hand over the fake currency cases to special investigation team.

 The move is in the backdrop of a comeback staged by the fake currency rackets in rural areas in the district with the newly printed bundles of currency notes to the denomination of 2000 and 500. 
 
 Though printing and distribution operations are carried out in the local level, the illegal activities are being coordinated by gangs operating in Bangalore, said a senior police official. The inter-state network makes it a tough task for the police to root out the network, he said.
 
 The police are now planning to hand over the   to special investigation team to speed up the tracing of the origin of the counterfeit currencies, the official added.
 
  
 Counterfeit currencies resembling newly introduced currency notes are being used by the gangster for distribution in petrol pumps, hotels and other commercial establishments.
 
 The technical hazel faced by the police in tracing the origin of fake currency notes is paving way for the easy distribution of counterfeit currency notes. Though the police suspect the role of a Bangalore based gang behind the distribution of the fake currency notes, the real culprits are still remaining in the dark.
 
  
 The   police had seized counterfeit currencies to the tune of Rs 3.16 lakh from   in Kozhikode a few days ago. Two persons were also arrested by the police team in connection with the fake currency seizure.
 
  
 Three major fake currency seizures were made by the   police in the past three months. A major seizure of Rs 35.2 lakh was made by the rural police in November 2017.
 
 
 The police had arrested four persons in connection with the fake currency distribution following the seizure of fake currency in the denomination of Rs 2000. The police had also booked two persons from Vadakara on the charges of printing and distributing fake currencies.
