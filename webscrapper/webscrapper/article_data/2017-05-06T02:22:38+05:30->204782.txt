JALPAIGURI: Eight   of   escaped the   for   on Friday. Although police brought back six of the boys, two of them are untraced. 

 In a page right off a thriller, the eight, all inmates of the same room, dug a hole through the concrete wall of their room on the first floor and climbed down using bedsheets. They then crossed over the final barbed-wire fence. To prevent getting injured, they used blankets to cover the barb wires. 
 
 According to workers at the home, it took at least 15 days for the boys to dig through the wall. To hide their plan, the boys chose a spot on the wall just behind an almirah. During the day, the portion of the wall remained covered by the almirah and at night, they would drag the almirah and break parts of the wall noiselessly. 
 
 “They don’t have a criminal past. They were rescued from different places at different times. Their average age is 16,” said Pranay Dey, superintendent of the home.
