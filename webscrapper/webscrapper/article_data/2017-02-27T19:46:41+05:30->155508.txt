In the 89 years of  , there has never been a night like this! Veteran actors   and Faye Dunaway made jaws drop when they wrongly announced Damien Chazelle’s musical ‘La La Land’ as the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture, and later announced ‘Moonlight’ as the real winner of the night. The team from ‘La La Land’ was in the middle of its acceptance speeches when the mistake was discovered.

 
 
 
 It is believed to be the first time in living history that such a major mistake has happened at the prestigious award ceremony. According to reports, a mistake in handing over of the winner’s envelope was the reason behind the error – Beatty was given the ‘Best Actress in a Leading Role’ envelope with ‘La La Land’ actress Emma Stone as the winner, instead of the ‘Best Picture’ envelope which clearly stated ‘Moonlight’ as the winner. 
 
  
  
 Amidst the shock, drama and confusion on-stage, the ‘La La Land’ makers gracefully called on stage the ‘Moonlight’ cast and handed over the trophy to them. 
 
 
 
 Those tuned in to watch the award ceremony live, were quick to express their disbelief on social networking handles. A number of Hollywood celebrities took to Twitter and had a field day trolling the Academy for their ‘mean joke’.
