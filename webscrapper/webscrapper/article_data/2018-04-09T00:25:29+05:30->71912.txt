Mumbai: An alleged conman who was part of a three-member gang that cheated a businessman from Amritsar of Rs 10 lakh was arrested on Saturday. The arrested accused, Edwin Pinto is in police custody. The police said that Pinto and two of his accomplices — one identified only as Asif and the third whose identity is not known — had cheated the businessman by giving him counterfeit notes. The other two are absconding, said the police. The police said that the complainant, Amit Kumar Devraj who is into manufacturing business, had got to know Asif through a mutual friend. Devraj wanted to buy scrap and Asif offered to help him with a “good offer to buy scrap at a throwaway price from Mumbai Port Trust”. A police officer said that Devraj arrived in Mumbai last and met Asif, Pinto and their third aide in Colaba. Asif, however, insisted that Devraj pay up in cash. As he did not have Rs 10 lakh in cash, Devraj asked a friend in Punjab to transfer the amount through the banking system. “Once Asif got the money in his account, he cooked up an excuse that the deal to sell scrap had fallen through. That’s when Pinto offered to return the cash,” said a police officer. “As Devraj checked the cash he was given, he found only a few notes on top of the bundles were genuine. Pinto tried to flee, but was nabbed.” A cheating case has been filed at Colaba police station.
