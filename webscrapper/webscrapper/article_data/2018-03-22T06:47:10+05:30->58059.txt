NEW DELHI:   Screen Doors (PSD) were installed at the   and Chandni Chowk   stations on Wednesday. Both the stations are on the Yellow Line (HUDA City Centre-Samaypur Badli) of the Delhi Metro.

 While the infrastructure at these stations had come up long ago, the PSDs were not operational due to integration issues. Four other stations of the line — New Delhi, Central Secretariat, Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate — will also have PSDs soon.
  
 These PSDs were formally made operational by DMRC’s managing director, Mangu Singh from the control room of the   Metro   on Wednesday.
 
 “This is the first time that Delhi Metro has installed PSDs in already existing operational metro stations. The PSDs are a barrier between the platform and the tracks,” a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson said. “PSDs will help in better crowd management at these busy stations and at the same time prevent any untoward incidents in the metro, like jumping or falling on the tracks,” he said.
 
 “The installation and commissioning of these doors at already operational stations was a major challenge as the PSDs could be installed only during non-revenue hours depending on the availability of blocks during late night hours after the close of passenger services,” he said.
 
 The installation and commissioning of PSDs at the four other stations will be done gradually after examining the performance at Chandni Chowk and Chawri Bazar stations, the spokesperson said.
 
 Apart from the Airport Express Line, such doors are already functional from day one of the opening of Botanical Garden to Kalkaji Mandir section of Line-8 and Majlis Park to Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus section of Line-7.
