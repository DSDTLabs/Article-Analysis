CHANDIGARH: The   cabinet, which met under the chairmanship of chief minister   on Tuesday, approved an ordinance for Adoption of Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 enacted by the Union government.

 While addressing newspersons after the meeting, finance minister Captain Abhimanyu said a decision to that effect was necessitated since at present there was no legislation in Haryana to regulate and register the clinical establishments in order to ensure minimum standards of facilities and services for providing quality healthcare.
 
 Soon after the   dengue incident, the state government had announced to adopt the central act. The state government move had triggered unrest among private practitioners and the diagnostic centres across Haryana.
 
 In December 2017, the Haryana chapter of the   ( ) had called for a day-long symbolic strike. Last week, the lab technicians also threatened strike while asking the government to amend the act in the interest of the technicians conducting clinical tests.
 
 The ordinance to be brought in by state will cover the clinical establishments having more than 50 beds. The effective implementation of the Act will ensure that clinical establishments in the state adopt ethical medical practices in treatment and patient care. Effective action can be taken against clinical establishments indulging in fraudulent or unethical practices under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010. The Act will also ensure quality care and treatment to the patients at fair and affordable price.
 
 The finance minister also said various stakeholders, including the IMA had urged that small clinical establishments having up to 50 beds be exempt initially from applicability of the Act as they lack the capacity and preparedness to comply with the provisions of the Act.
