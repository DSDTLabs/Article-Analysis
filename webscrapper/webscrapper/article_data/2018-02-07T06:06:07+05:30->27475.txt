KOLKATA: Impelled by two cycle-borne youths at Chingrighata on   last Saturday, Kolkata   has started a drive against cyclists on key crossings across the city.

 On Tuesday, several were prosecuted for cycling on roads prohibited for slowmoving vehicles. TOI accompanied officers at one such drive at   on Monday afternoon, where plain-clothed officers latched on to cyclists and seized nine vehicles and penalized the riders in 20 minutes. The cycles were put on a mini-truck and were taken to   police station where the riders had to pay a fine to get their twowheelers back.
 
 
 “I regularly take my cycle to work from my home at   as it is economical. But today, the cops caught me at the crossing and penalized me. I had to pay Rs 100 to get my cycle back,” said Shyamkishore Thakur, a retired homeguard who now works as a security guard at a highrise on Hazra Road. Mahabharat Goswami, 61, an insurance agent from  , was also fined as he was riding home from his office at Ballygunge Phanri.
 
 The amended traffic rules identify cycles as slowmoving vehicles that are prohibited on 70 roads — including Ballygunge Phanri, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Red Road, JL Nehru Road and Park Street — in the city. However, a traffic sergeant said the rule isn’t implemented regularly as most people using cycles are from low-income group. Cycles are also considered environment-friendly across the world and the state government had plans of dedicated cycling tracks on the Bypass but the project never took off.
