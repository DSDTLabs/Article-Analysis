MUMBAI: A Romanian national, aged around 35 years, died after falling from the 11th floor of a corporate park at   late Wednesday morning. Police sources said the man jumped to death 15 minutes after walking into Maker Chamber V around 11am. 

 Cuffe Parade police found only a Goa-Mumbai bus ticket and a receipt of a Panaji home-stay in his shorts, and no document such as passport or bank card to establish his identity. Based on the ticket, investigators learnt that he had come from Goa just a few hours before the incident. Police suspect he could have come there as the floor from which he fell housed the Romanian consulate till 2009.
 
 When police approached the travel agency that operates the bus, they learnt that co-passengers had helped him with money to buy the ticket. "We called the travel agent in Goa and learnt that the man was found begging with passengers to buy a ticket to Mumbai. The passengers contributed and helped him. We called the place where the deceased stayed in Goa. Search is on to get details about his baggage," police said. 
 
 The CCTV camera at the building entrance captured the man walking into the premises around 11am. "He jumped from the corridor window next to the building lift. People were standing downstairs when he landed. He was wearing a T-shirt and a three-fourths," said a police officer.
