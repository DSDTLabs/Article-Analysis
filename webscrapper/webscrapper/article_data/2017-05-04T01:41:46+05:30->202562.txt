MUMBAI:   have alleged that   contractors are yet again using the excuse of quarries being shut and are blackmailing the   to not complete road repair   on time.

 The BMC, after the withdrawal of the monsoon last year, undertook repairs of 1,004 roads. Officials were told by contractors that repair works were hit after the closure of stone quarries in Thane district since April 1 over pollution issues.
 
 “The contractors are only using the reason of quarries being shut to blackmail the BMC,” BJP party leader Manoj Kotak said. “It is the contractor’s responsibility to bring the raw materials for the road repairs from any other quarries.”
 
 Kotak said only the road contractors named in the BMC road scam were saying theri work had been affected.
 
 Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray and mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar on Wednesday met CM Devendra Fadnavis over the   ban affecting road works. “The CM has given favourable orders to the administration to assist the BMC, on our request and presentation, to help   be smooth,” tweeted Thackeray.
 
 The BJP in the BMC said the CM was unnecessarily being dragged into the issue. “Environment minister Ramdas Kadam (of the Shiv Sena) should raise the issue in the right forum instead,” Kotak said.
 
 The chief engineer of roads Sanjay Darade said warning letters had been sent to contractors that their performance guarantee would be seized if repair works were delayed.
