Visakhapatnam: The district will soon have archery, cycling and rifle shooting academies, district sports development officer John Geliat said, adding that sports enthusiasts aged between 15 and 18 years will be trained in the academies.

 Addressing the media here on Friday, Geliat said every academy will train 20 players. “Athletes coming from rural and Agency areas will be provided with boarding facilities,” she said, adding that such facilities will be set up at Narsipatnam and Yelamanchili.
 
 “Players who excel at the academies will be referred to state, national and international championships,” Geliat said.
 
 "The academies will inculcate sportsmanship among the youth in rural and Agency areas which lack proper sports related infrastructure," Geliat said.
 
 She also said that district-level selections in cycling will be held at Aqua Sports Complex on Beach Road on Sunday, while selections for archery and rifle shooting will be held at Samskruthi Global School at Parawada on Monday.
