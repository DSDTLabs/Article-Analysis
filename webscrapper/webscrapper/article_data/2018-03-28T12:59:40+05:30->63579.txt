CHENNAI: Carcasses of nine   were found beside railway tracks near   station in   on Tuesday morning. The bovines were run over by trains around 2am and the decomposing carcasses lay near the tracks till 11am with foul stench giving a tough time to the commuters. 

 Sources in the Chennai division of   said they were probing the matter to find out if someone had led the buffaloes onto the tracks in the dead of the night. 
 
 "It is highly unlikely that the cattle were sent out to graze at night," said a source.
 
 The carcasses were found in between two of the four railway tracks on the route which falls on the Chennai-Arakkonam section. Gangmen found it tough to remove the carcasses as they were very heavy. The rush of trains in the morning also proved a hassle.
 
 In one case witnessed by a TOI photo-journalist, by the time the gangmen lifted one carcass over one track a train was approaching it. Since the carcass could derail the train, it was hurriedly moved back in between the tracks. This was the second incident in as many days. Dead cattle were found rotting beside the Annanur railway station.
 
 In January, two buffaloes were killed and four injured on the elevated MRTS stretch after they had strayed from   town station. 
 
 Authorities had a tough time as they had to wait for train operations to stop at night to operate a crane and remove the carcasses from the overhead tracks.
