LUCKNOW: A large number of private unaided schools in Lucknow will remain shut on Saturday, April 7 in solidarity with Save Education Day, which will be observed at   in New Delhi. 

  across the country have announced closure on April 7 to draw the government's attention to their concerns over the quality of education. 
 
 In Lucknow, private schools under the aegis of   (UPSA) will remain shut.   in a press release issued on Thursday raised three concerns-improper implementation of Right to Education (RTE) Act, loss of autonomy of private schools due to increasing government control, and the dignity and respect of school staff. 
 
 UPSA said when any unfortunate incident occurs in a school, the blame is immediately fixed on the school management and staff, to the extent that they are either arrested or booked. This is mainly done to appease the public, UPSA said, adding that this is unjust and instils fear among staff. 
 
 The association clarified that private schools were ready to admit children eligible under RTE Act. 
 
 "If the government expects us to fulfil the obligations under RTE Act, it also needs to fulfil its legal obligations under the Act to properly reimburse private schools, at the legally correct rate in a timely manner, so that it does not violate private schools' fundamental right to occupation," said UPSA president Anil Agarwal.
