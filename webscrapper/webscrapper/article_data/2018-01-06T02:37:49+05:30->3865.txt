MUMBAI: The state home department is treading cautiously on the issue of banning   as it fears it's proposal may not stand the test in the  , like in the case of dance bars. In 2015, the SC lifted a ban imposed on dance bars. The state then passed a regulation bill, which mandates that dance bars follow stringent rules. 

 Fire brigade officials suspect that last week's fire at a Lower Parel resto-bar in which 14 people died could have been caused due to burning coal used in hookahs. Although there is no official ban on hookah parlours in the state, neither is there a system in place to issue licences for such establishments. The ministry is working on a proposal to ban or regulate hookah parlours.
 
 As there is no specific study which cites hookah as a health hazard, the government is trying to make a watertight case. "The ban should not be struck down by the SC. If the ban is challenged in the court of law, the government should have a strong reason to prove that hookah needs to be banned," said a senior official. The SC in December 2014 struck down the ban on sale and use of hookahs in hotels, restaurants and airports where smoking is otherwise legally permitted. -Sujit Mahamulkar
