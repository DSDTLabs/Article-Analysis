 CHANDIGARH: With summer here, there have been 12 incidents of cars catching fire in Chandigarh alone since April. Though no one has been injured in the incidents, experts warn owners that a lot of times the cars “selfcombust“ when unauthorized mechanics leave connections in the engine loose.According to them, delayed servicing of cars is another reason behind such fires, as hose pipes, diesel pipes and rubber tubes develop cracks, says  , who is a senior manager in a car company. “These things happen when electrical short circuits, engine oil leak and unauthorized service dealers wash the engine and leave loose connections,“ he says.
