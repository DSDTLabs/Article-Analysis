PUNE: The Pune district administration has proposed a   for easy   of voters’ names on the   commission  .

 Presently, the voters’ names appear in Marathi in a separate file on the website. As per the proposal, a special ‘e-search’ facility will be provided on the website, which will have all the names in English and Marathi languages for the convenience of voters.
 
 “We will have a pilot project of all the names being made available through a special e-search facility in both English and Marathi languages for one of the 21 constituencies. It will be replicated for all other constituencies later,” Pune district collector Saurabh Rao said.
 
 He said help will be sought from a technical team for this project. “If the search facility is made easily available in both the languages, it will resolve the issues of wrong spellings of names. Even if the spelling of any name is wrong, it can be corrected by approaching the concerned electoral registration officer,” district election officials said.
 
 In the last civic elections, many people could not find their names in the voters’ list as their names were misspelt. Julia D’Souza from Kondhwa had her name spelt as ‘Suja’ because of which she could not vote. “If an e-search facility is made available in English, it will benefit people like me,” she said.
 
 Deputy election officer Monica Singh said the initiative will people, especially those who do not hail from Maharashtra.
 
 With a massive list of nearly 71.89 lakh voters, the trial will be carried out in consultation with the state election department. With the National Voters’ Day on January 25, the election department has readied a list of 71.89 lakh voters and have an addition of 44,000 names of new voters. On deletion of names, Singh said notices have been issued to 2.24 lakh voters with duplicate names in the voters’ list. “Nearly 45,000 names have been deleted of people from the list for reasons like their death,” she added.
