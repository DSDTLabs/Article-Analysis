NEW DELHI: South African wicketkeeper-batsman   has been confirmed as the replacement for   in Rajasthan Royals’ squad for the 11th season of the   starting April 7. Smith had last week stepped down as captain of Rajasthan following the ball-tampering controversy that broke in Cape Town, and then had his IPL contract torn up once Cricket Australia suspended him for 12 months. 

 
 
 
 
 A BCCI press release today confirmed that Klaasen, 26, has been purchased by Rajasthan for his base price of Rs 50 lakh having been overlooked during the player auction in January. This will be his first stint with an IPL franchise. 
 
 
 
  "I am thankful to the   for giving me this opportunity and making me part of the squad. It would be my first IPL and in fact my first ever visit to India so I am really excited to be teaming up and sharing the dressing room with some great names. I have made it my mission to ensure my performance makes a large impact for my team in the tournament,” said Klaasen in statement released by the franchise. 
 
 In 49 career T20s, Klaasen has scored 1043 runs at a strike-rate of 146.28, with six fifties. He has 28 catches and 12 stumpings too. He made his T20I debut against India in February and was Man of the Match in his second game, scoring 69 off 30 balls as South Africa chased down India’s total of 188 with six wickets and eight balls remaining. 
 
 Smith had been a key figure for Rajasthan Royals before the franchise was suspended for two years following the spot-fixing scandal of 2013. In the interim, he played for Rising Pune Supergiant and last year led the franchise to the IPL final where they narrowly lost to Mumbai Indians.
 
 Last week, Smith had been suspended for one year for his role in the ball-tampering controversy. Rajasthan named Ajinkya Rahane as captain for the 2018 IPL season on the same day on which the BCCI announced that Smith’s IPL contract was torn up.
