BERHAMPUR:   at   looks likely to be delayed further if officials engaged in the process are lent for duty in the upcoming  . 

 Agricultural cooperative employees, including the secretary of the   (PACs), are generally entrusted with the duty of paddy procurement. The procurement is usually done through the 373 PACs and the 376 district administration-run procurement centres or mandis across the district. 
 
  Farmers alleged that paddy procurement has not been gaining momentum this time as all mandis have not been opened in all places.
 
  The government, this year, has set a target to procure 30 lakh quintal of paddy from more that 81,000 farmers who have registered to supply paddy. 
 
 "At this stage, if staff engaged in the procurement process are given election duty then the ongoing paddy procurement will be affected severely. Farmers will be forced to sell the paddy to middlemen," said  , convener of the Odisha Chasi Surakshya Abhiyan.
