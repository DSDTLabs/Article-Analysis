KOLKATA: Worried over the future of their businesses and shelters, occupants of the   in question huddled into a meeting on Monday to decide on the next step. Though there was unanimity on providing support to construction of the East-West tunnel, there was unmistakable anxiety on their faces.

 “The notice was a bolt from the blue. We have never been told about the survey conducted on these buildings nor were we informed about the impending evacuation. If it happens, how long it may last? We all want a   route but livelihood of hundreds of people depend on the business establishments that are being run from these buildings said Avik Daw of Daw Brothers.
 
 The stony silence of the   (KMC) has shocked the occupants. “They should have informed earlier. Even if the construction agency arranges an alternative address for a short while, we need some preparation,” said Manish Puhan, who has been living at 12/18, Woodmunt Street house since his birth. 
 
 Transtonnelstroy Afcons engineers have assured the suspension of business will be for a very short period. “We need to detect the weaknesses the structures developed over a long period of time and look for remedial measures. The faster we can do it, quicker will be progress of the project,” said an engineer.
 
 Deb Shankar Chatterjee of   and Tapas Kundu of J C Kundu of 22, Raja Woodmunt Street said they were ready to suspend their business for a few days. “But we are not clear how long this may take. It would be great if we could meet the engineers to have an idea about the extent of evacuation,” said Chatterjee.
 
 Manik Singvi, another occupant of 24 Raja Woodmunt Street, added, “The memory of the construction of north-south Metro, which necessitated a much greater evacuation, haunts us. But I have told my fellow traders and residents that modern technology made it least invasive. We all will appear before the court to extend all possible cooperation to the project,” he said.
