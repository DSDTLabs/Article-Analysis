MOHALI: A resident of Balongi, reported to the cops that Rs 43,500 were withdrawn from his account fraudulently although the debit card was with the victim. The cash was withdrawn from an ATM in Ludhiana following which the victim lodged a police complaint.

 The victim  , a native of   district in  , came to   a few months back. He has been working at a private company since then and has his saving account in a private bank.
 
 On Sunday, Ravi received a text message on his phone number that Rs 42,000 has been withdrawn from his account. Minutes after the first message, another message informed him about a transaction in which Rs 1,500 were withdrawn from his account.
 
 The victim could not understand how the money was deducted from his account, without him withdrawing money. He also could not figure out how was it possible when the debit card was still with him.
 
 Assuming it to be an error by the bank, Ravi waited for a while for it to get corrected. When no further message was received from the bank, Ravi called up on the bank’s customer care number and informed the bank representative about the messages that he had received.
 
 The representative, after looking into the matter, informed him that the money was withdrawn from his account using debit card at an ATM in Ludhiana. Sensing that he has been duped, Ravi requested the bank to block his card. He then informed the cops about the incident and filed a written complaint. Acting on the complaint, the cops are fetching CCTV footage from the ATM in Ludhiana to identify the accused, who had withdrawn cash from Ravi’s account.
