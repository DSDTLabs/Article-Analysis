 On hearing the explosion, locals rushed to the spot to find Biswas lying in a pool of blood. Police recovered 29 more crude bombs from the spot.
 
 With panchayat elections in the state less than a month away, cops have not ruled out the possibility of these bombs being stowed to create trouble during the election process.
