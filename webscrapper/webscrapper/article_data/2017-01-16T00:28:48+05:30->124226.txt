Indore: The Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has finally started river front development work of Kahn under the Smart City project.

 While the work like restricting drain water from entering the river has already started, other works like building walking track and other beautification work is expected to begin by the end of this month.
 
 The first phase of development of river front would be done from Rambagh bridge to Krishnapura. Officials of the municipal body said that in the first phase, the stretch from Rambagh bridge to Krishnapura would be given a facelift. Around Rs 4 crore would be spent on the project.
 
 In the second stage, the stretch from Jawahar Marg to Gangaur ghat would be renovated. In the last phase of development work, Gangaur Ghat to Karbala bridge would be developed.
 
 However, the biggest problem that the civic body is facing is finding a suitable place for those, who would be displaced.
 
 In the stretch of 3.9 km, there are a lot of encroachments on the river banks. Illegal slums are present all along Jawahar Marg, Chndrabhaga and Kabutarkhana area.
 
 The stretch from Harsidhi bridge to Gangaur ghat also has many illegal establishments.
 
 Many corporators had also alleged that some structures made by the civic body was also encroaching the area.
 
 Parks, leisure spaces and green belts would be constructed all along the river bed. Officials of IMC had planned to develop the river side like Sabarmati in Gujarat.
 
 The civic body is also working on cleaning the river water and treating waste before disposal. A decentralized treatment plant would be installed at four locations that would prevent polluted water from entering the river.
 
 The IMC has also handed over banks of the Kahn to the forest department to carry out plantation work. While the land does not belong to the forest department, IMC has asked them to take care of the area as mass scale plantation is required and they do not have expertise.
