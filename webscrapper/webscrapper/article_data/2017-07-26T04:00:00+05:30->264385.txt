Rajkot: A class XII girl committed suicide by hanging from a ceiling fan at her house in Munjha Titodiya area of the city on Monday evening. 

 Urmi Barad (18) was found hanging by her parents when they returned from work. 
 
 Police sifted through her school bag and books, but didn’t recover any suicide note. However, preliminary investigation suggested that she may have taken the drastic step due to poor financial condition of the family. Her father drives an autorickshaw, while mother works as a domestic help. Her elder brother had gone to work at a local factory and younger one had gone for tuition.
 
 “At around 5pm, she made tea for her parents, who left the house for some work. When they returned at 7pm, they were surprised to see the door locked from inside. When no one opened the door, they got suspicious and somehow managed to open it from inside only to see her hanging from the fan,” sources at the University Road police station said.tnn
