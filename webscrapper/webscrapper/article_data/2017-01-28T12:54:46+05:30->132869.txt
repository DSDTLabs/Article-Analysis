Lover, friend or brother, he has played it all! However, now he is all set to play a host for a game show in his show Thapki Pyar Ki.
 
  In order to prepare for the role, Sehban spent a lot of time research on the fine nuance of the act. He keenly watched many episode of Mr. Bachchan hosting KBC to perfect the role.
  
  
  
 
  
 
  
  Speaking about the same, he said “ I am playing a game show host in the next few episodes and who best to take inspiration from but the greatest host of India~ Mr. Bachchan! I have spent a lot of time watching Mr. Bachchan hosting the most popular game show of India and have tried to inculcate a lot of those bits into my act.
  The way he builds suspense and the way he ensures that the participants as well as audience is engrossed in the game is absolutely amazing. I know its difficult to match up to him but I sure have learnt a lot from the master.”
  
  With Mr. Bachchan as the guru, we are sure Sehban is going to deliver one hell of a performance as a host!
