PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   is starting a facility to manage and recycle debris ( ) on a design-build-own-operate basis for a 21-year period. 

 The private agency assigned the contract will be responsible for the collection of debris from across the city — including from the roadside, dumping said debris at identified processing plants and creating   of the facility. For the purpose of waste collection, the agency will be required to install designated bins in different areas. 
 
 Speaking to TOI earlier, PCMC commissioner   had said management of construction waste was a major problem, with people dumping it in rivers or on roadside. “PCMC will appoint an agency to start a processing unit where a toll-free number will be provided,” Waghmare had said. “Citizens who want to get rid of the debris can contact the number.” 
 
 Concrete blocks can be made from the recycled waste. The only other functional facility is in New Delhi, said Waghmare, adding that the PCMC was in the process of identifying sites where the processing units could be set up.
 
 Depending on the season, between 150 and 200 tonnes of construction waste is generated per day, according to civic officials. Apart from the toll-free number, the agency would also have to develop a mobile application. 
 
 The agency, which would get an operational fee from the civic body, will get the revenue from the by-products generated from the facility.
 
 The agency will be required to use a combination of processes like crushing, washing, screening and separation of waste, to ensure maximum waste treatment and minimum landfill. Until such time as the municipal corporation frames bylaws in this regard, the entire system would be compliant with the construction and demolition rules of 2016.
