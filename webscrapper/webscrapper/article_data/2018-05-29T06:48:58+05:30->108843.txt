CHANDIGARH: A district court here sentenced a man to 15 years in prison on Monday for raping his seven-year-old daughter. 

 The court of additional district and sessions judge   convicted the man under sections of the POCSO Act. The father of two is a musician. The court has imposed a fine of 1.5 lakh on him. Of this amount, Rs 1 lakh will be given to the rape survivor. 
 
 The cour order describes the role of a father as that of the protector of the family. “But you have destroyed the future of the young girl; this will have long-term effects on her, and her perception of men,” the court order reads.
 
 The court said the offence did not deserve any leniency. “It is not only a grievous offence, but a shameful act for the family,” the court said.
 
 The judgment stated that the girl could have problems in her future relationships and this would be detrimental to society at large.
 
 The rapist father was booked on November 17, 2017, on a complaint by his wife. The woman alleged that she took her daughter for a checkup to the PGIMER after she complained of a stomachache. On their way to the hospital, the girl told her mother that her father, who used to return home drunk, sexually abused her. 
 
 The mother requested the police to take strict action against her husband. The girl’s medical examination at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, confirmed rape. During the trial, the woman turned hostile and said her husband could never do anything like this. But the court held the man guilty.
