HYDERABAD: Noting that some sections and provisions in the Telangana Eunuchs Act, 1329F, are atrocious and inhuman, the   asked   to think in terms of removing them from the law book failing which the court may have to intervene and get them deleted by declaring them as unconstitutional. It would be unfair to brand them as criminals if they dress differently or are found with minors, HC said, observing that kids have become vulnerable and blaming transgenders for it is incorrect. 

 The bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice K   were hearing a petition filed by transgender activists V Vasantha Mogli and two others, who challenged the constitutional validity of the Act.
 
 Sai Sandeep Pareekshit, counsel for the petitioners, told the HC under Sections 3 and 4, registration of eunuchs in official records is a must. Even participation in music programmes and dancing may land them in jail. The bench found such provisions and police action as inhuman and sought to know how it becomes a crime if a minor is found with transgenders.   said, "Transgenders seen roaming with boys are being. They could be their relatives and seeking to criminalise every aspect of their lives is inhuman." Transgenders found roaming with minors are arrested on the ground of unnatural offences against children.
 
 The counsel said looking at eunuchs as suspects in itself is a crime. In fact, the use of word eunuch is a humiliation to transgenders. He reminded the HC that a similar battle in Karnataka had resulted the government removing the word eunuch from their law book. He sought a blanket stay on implementation of Telangana Eunuchs Act, stating it deprives transgenders of their fundamental rights. The bench said there is need to revisit these pre-independence and archaic laws and sought detailed counters from state home secretary, social welfare secretary and city police commissioner.
