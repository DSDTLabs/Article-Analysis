AMRITSAR/PATHANKOT: Is   (AAP) cashing in on   to clinch win in Punjab assembly elections?

 AAP, which is making its debut in Punjab assembly polls, seems to be playing the baniya card to woo the significant  , known as arthiyas, in certain regions.
 
 While AAP has fielded five baniya candidates,   have put up two each. Even though the trader community's influence is limited to Bathinda and Sangrur, AAP has fielded three candidates from the community in seats outside this region.
 
 These are Amritsar North (Manish Aggarwal), Amritsar Central (Ajay Gupta) and Pathankot (Raj Kumar Mahajan). In 2015 Delhi elections, the BJP had taken a swipe at AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal with an advertisement that described him as a politician from “updravi gotra“.
 
 The three parties fare more or less equally on the number of Sikh profiles in their list. While AAP and SAD-BJP have 64 candidates each from the community, Congress has 62. AAP has also handed over more tickets to dalits with 31 Sikh Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates. While SAD-BJP has 26, Congress has 24 such candidates.
 
 Most of these candidates are either Ravidasia or Valmiki or Mazhabi Sikhs.
 
 Kejriwal, who has shied away from announcing any chief ministerial candidate for his party, had announced that his deputy chief minister will be from the dalit community.
 
 When it comes to fielding Hindu SC candidates, Congress has put up nine such aspirants, SAD-BJP eight and AAP five.
 
 A sociologist, Pramod Kumar, said 97 out of 117 consituencies in Punjab represented diversity of caste and religion. “This means they have equal concentration of Dalits, Jat Sikhs, and Hindus.That is why social engineering is done by some parties to have adequate representation of one community in any seat. Which is why all parties have almost similar Sikh candidates, but AAP seems to have put extra mind in ensuring that the particular community is not left out,“ he said.
