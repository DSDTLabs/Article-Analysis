NAGPUR: With the aim to improve the city’s air quality, a local-level committee has been formed to prepare an action plan for prevention and control of air pollution in Nagpur. Reportedly, Nagpur is one of the chosen cities by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for ambient air quality monitoring. 

 The first meeting of the committee was held on Monday in which officials of   (NMC),   (MPCB), Public Works Department (PWD), Regional Transport Office (RTO) and NGOs were present.
 
 Various sources of air pollution including garbage burning, construction activities, concretization of roads, vehicular and industrial emissions and more will be assessed, informed founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee who was part of the meeting. Different departments have been allotted responsibilities but NMC will coordinate the plan. 
 
 CPCB has stated that the public health is getting adversely affected due to the presence of high amount of air pollutants in the ambient air. 
 
 “In order to arrest the deterioration in air quality, the central government has enacted Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act in 1981. The responsibility has been further emphasized under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. It is necessary to assess the present and anticipated air pollution through continuous air quality survey/monitoring programs,” the board added.
