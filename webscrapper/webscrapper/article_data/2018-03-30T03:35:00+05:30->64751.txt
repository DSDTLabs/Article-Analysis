Panaji: Aspiring drivers will soon be issued licences by way of a computerised   track at a new centre in  . 

 “We are in the process of having our own driving track through the   for Automotive Technology. Such tracks have been constructed in   and Hisar. We have seen the vehicle testing offices and the driving tracks, based on which we have submitted a proposal to the government,” a transport official said.
 
 He said the initiative will be executed under a Central government scheme for setting up of driving training centres. “It will be done on a public-private partnership (PPP) model,” he added.
 
 Once aspirants enrol themselves, they might also be given an opportunity to practice driving. Right now, tests are conducted only in the mornings. Once the centre comes up, RTOs may be given slots between 8am-8pm, according to which they would have to bring their candidates for the test.
 
 At present, tests are conducted at a particular site close to the regional transport office (RTO) by inspectors attached to the RTO. The new centre will ensure minimum human interference during the test.
 
 “What we do now is visual inspection. At the centre, there will be an electronic machinery to check propeller vibration, breaking efficiency, sensors on rollers, etc. Every test carried out will be given a computerised reading and accordingly, candidates will be cleared,” the officer said.
