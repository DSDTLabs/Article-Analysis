BENGALURU: The Karnataka poll — the results of which will be announced on May 15 — is already heated with BJP and Congress keenly aware of the importance of the prize: A loss will rob Congress of one of two major states in which it is still in office while BJP needs a win to regain the momentum it lost after SP and BSP came together to win two prestigious UP bypolls despite a saffron victory in Tripura.

 
 TOI analyses strengths and weaknesses of the three major parties in the Karnataka assembly polls.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • Siddaramaiah’s welfare schemes, Anna Bhagya, Arogya Bhagya, Ksheera Bhagya, Indira Canteens have benefited people and should be a buffer for the Congress against the usual discontent facing the incumbent . Invoking Kannada pride and lending support for Karnataka to have its own state flag won him brownie points
 
 • A shrewd politician steeped in Mandal politics, the CM stitched a social coalition — Ahinda (comprising backwards), Dalits and Muslims. He has tried to expand the base with his outreach to Lingayats
 
 • Though a late entrant to the Congress, he emerged as a powerful CM and undisputed party boss. That’s why he’s the only CM to have served his full five-year term in the past four decades and can help Congress’s appeal for a fresh term for him
 
 • Congress’s desperate need to hold on to the only big state, apart from Punjab, in their kitty
  
 
 
 
 • Lack of coordination between government and party in popularising the government’s welfare schemes
 
 • Corruption charges against senior ministers
 
 • Too many camps and factionalism in the Congress despite leaadership’s support for Siddaramaiah
 
 • Attempt to consolidate Ahinda can render CM vulnerable to BJP’s appeasement charge
 
 • Presence of former PM H D Deve Gowda’s JD(S) as a possible spoiler in some parts
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 • Projection of B S Yeddyurappa as CM candidate is likely to help unite a fractious party behind the best-known saffron figure. He, along with BJP’s B Sriramulu, contributed hugely to party’s defeat five years ago by breaking away. Sriramulu is also back in the fold
 
 • Despite Siddaramaiah ‘s effort to split Lingayats, the community with a vote share of 15-17%, is likely to back the party because of their community man Yeddyurappa being projected as CM candidate. The Lingayats distanced themselves from Congress in 1990 after the unceremonious removal of Veerendra Patil as CM.
 
 • Stronger cadre presence gives the challenger a headstart over Congress. Allied saffron outfits can help by exploiting any unrest against “appeasement”
 
 • Appeal of PM Modi
 
 
 
 
 • Corruption charge against Yed dyurappa who served time before being acquitted. Congress has tarred him a “jailbird”
 
 • Despite Amit Shah’s efforts, factionalism persists between Yeddyurappa and KS Eshwarappa. Both hail from Shivamogga district
 
 • Has a thinner social base as compared to Congress
 
 • Over reliance on Modi when he is in the fourth year of his term
 
 • Weakening of Deve Gowda reduces the prospect of division in anti-BJP votes
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 HD Deve Gowda, the former PM has ceased to be a statewide factor. But thanks to the staunch support of fellow Vokkaligas, he remains a formidable force in the Old Mysore region. He hopes his son H D Kumaraswamy will return with a tally which will help him play kingmaker should neither Congress nor BJP get a majority.
 
 
 
 
 • Popularity of H D Kumaraswamy, especially among the working class in the unorganised sector, and programmes like Grama Vastavya (village stays) he introduced when in power
 
 • Party’s alliance with BSP and Left parties. Efforts are on to rope in Telugu superstar Pavan Kalyan for campaigning which may increase party’s appeal among young voters
 
 • Party is trying to reach out to evoke regional sentiments and it might appeal to a section of the electorate
 
 • The ‘left out’ feeling among Vokkaligas may help the party to consolidate its position in the Old Mysuru region
 
 
 
 
 • The tag of father-son party
 
 • No pan-Karnataka presence; absence of leaders who can influence voters in North Karnataka and Coastal Karnataka
 
 • Lack of resources
