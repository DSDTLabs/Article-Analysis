PUNE: A 28-year-old man, identified as Rupesh Jadhav, was found hanging from the ceiling in his house at Moshi on Monday night in what appears to be a case of suicide.

 A number of photographs of his wedding ceremony and his in-laws were found strewn on the floor around the body.
 
 The police are trying to unlock Jadhav’s cellphone and check if he left any video clip explaining why he ended his life. Sub-inspector Shrikant   said one of Jadhav’s relatives said Jadhav was frustrated ever since his wife left him two months ago and refused to return.
 
  
 “We have registered a case of accidental death,” Shendge said.
 
 Shendge said the matter came to light late on Monday night when Jadhav’s neighbours in Khande Vasti found that he was not responding despite repeated knocks on the main door.
 
 “After getting the information, our team went to Khande Vasti and broke open the door. We found Jadhav hanging from the ceiling in his house,” Shendge said and added, “We noticed photographs of Rupesh Jadhav’s wedding ceremony and his in-laws lying on the floor near him.”
 
 He said Jadhav was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead by the doctors. “Jadhav hailed from   in   district. About two years ago, he married a woman from the same district. The couple had been living in Moshi since then,” Shendge said.
 
 Roughly two months ago, Jadhav’s wife went to her parent’s house in Nashik and refused to return to Moshi. “Some time ago, Jadhav too had gone to his in-law’s house to convince his wife to return home. But, his wife refused,” Shendge said.
 
 Jadhav reportedly had been very frustrated since then. “He may have ended his life out of frustration,” Shendge added.
 
 The police found Jadhav’s cellphone in the house. “We are trying to unlock it to verify if Jadhav had left any clip,” Shendge said.
 
 He said Jadhav’s relatives took his body to Nashik to perform his last rites. “We will question them after the rituals,” Shendge said.
