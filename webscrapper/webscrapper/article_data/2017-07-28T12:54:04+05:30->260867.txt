CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that it is not necessary that the   should contain the description of customs of the parties going for adoption. “It cannot be expected that the adoption deed would contain the description of custom as applicable. The provisions of the act do not require that the adoption deed must contain an assertion with respect to applicability of customary law. Adoption deed is required to be in writing and registered,” observed the HC.

 Justice Anil Kshetarpal passed these orders while upholding the adoption of a minor boy from a   community from Sonipat district. His adoption was challenged on the grounds that adoption beyond 15 years of age is not permissible under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 unless permitted by customs. It was also argued that the custom among Jats, permitting adoption of a son beyond the age of 15, was not mentioned in the adoption deed.
 
 “Apart from formal suggestion, no evidence has been brought on record to disprove the pleadings and the evidence with respect to existence of custom. Adoption deed is in writing and is duly registered,” the court observed while upholding the adoption.
 
 The case relates to  , a resident of Khanpur Khurd village in Sonipat, and his four sons — Rajender,   Singh, Joginder and Narender Singh. The dispute in the present case is with regard to the estate of  , who died unmarried and issueless on July 8, 2005. Narender had adopted Parveen alias Manjeet, son of his brother Rajender through registered adoption deed executed on June 26, 2005.
 
 However, Parveen’s adoption was challenged by Sube on the grounds that he was beyond the age of 15 on the date of adoption. It was further argued that specific custom of Jat community, where custom allows adoption beyond 15 years, has not been mentioned or specified in the deed.
 
 Sube’s plea was dismissed by the subordinate courts in Sonipat after which he had approached the high court.
