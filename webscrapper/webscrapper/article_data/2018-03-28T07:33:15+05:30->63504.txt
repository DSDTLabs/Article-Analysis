PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation has told SWaCH, a waste-pickers’ collective, against collecting trash disposed of in black garbage bags.

 The move follows the notification on plastic ban issued by the state government late last week. In the notification, black garbage bags have also been included in the banned items list. “There is a month’s time to implement the ban, during which we will come up with alternatives to these bags,”   joint commissioner   told TOI on Tuesday. 
  
 
 At present, civic officials and SWaCH workers are reaching out to housing societies and urging them not to use the black garbage bags.   of SWaCH said the waste-pickers’ collective welcomes the move. “However, a lot depends on how citizens react to it,” she said.
 
 SWaCH has highlighted the need to even ban multi-layered plastic packaging, the one used in chips packets. “This has been completely left out of the ban ambit, but it poses a huge problem in solid waste management,” Harshad Barde, spokesperson of SWaCH, said.
 
 Citizens have stressed on the need to create awareness to ensure efficient implementation of the ban. “Such announcements have been made in the past too, but to no avail. I doubt if it can be implemented within a month,”   said.
 
 Activist   said people are slowly warming up to the use of cloth bags.
