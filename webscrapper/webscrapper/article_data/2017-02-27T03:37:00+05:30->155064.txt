Calangute: The   panchayat has decided to acquire a three-bedroom apartment in Mumbai to be developed into a ‘Calangute Bhavan’

 The decision was taken during a gram sabha on Sunday to discuss budgetary proposals for 2017-18. “Many villagers from Calangute visit Mumbai for medical treatment and some have difficulty in finding accomodation,” says deputy sarpanch Joseph Sequeira. “The flat will have rooms where people from Calangute can stay while their relatives undergo treatment. Many visit Mumbai for cancer treatment, so the ‘Calangute Bhavan’ will be located close to the Tata Memorial Hospotal in Parel.” The apartment will be acquired at a cost of Rs 2 crore. The proposal was received favourably at the gram sabha.
 
 A number of other issues were also discussed during the gram sabha. When members demanded that the panchayat build a cow shelter to tackle the menace of stray cattle, Sequeira said that the panchayat did not have land for a ‘gaoshala’. 
 
 When the menace of unauthorized hawkers was raised, he said that the menace continued because eviction of hawkers has to be done with police protection, which is not always available.
 
 When members demanded that the panchayat identify low-lying areas with water bodies so that they could all be desilted and cleaned before the monsoon, Sequeira passed the buck, saying it was the job of the Water Resources Department. Some members also raised apprehensions of flooding in some areas if desilting was not done.
