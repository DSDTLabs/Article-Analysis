NEW DELHI: The Crime Branch has written to   to ascertain the IP address of a Gmail account that was used to send mails to the   on March 28 warning about the leaks. Police haven’t ruled out the possibility of a whistle-blower sending the mails even as it probes whether it could be a “catch-me-if-you-can” dare on part of a gang suspected to be behind the leaks.

 The board was reportedly tipped off about the paper leaks at least thrice. In one case, a copy of the Class XII economics paper was sent to the office of the   chairperson on March 26 through a courier, but didn't have a sender’s address. The sender also reportedly mentioned a WhatsApp number from which the paper was leaked.
 
 On March 28, an e-mail from a username, “devn532@gmail.com”, urged CBSE to cancel the Class X maths examination scheduled for a few hours later. The sender reportedly attached a 12-page handwritten copy of the  . Three days later, another unsigned packet was sent to the CBSE office at Rouse Avenue mentioning mobile numbers of the people who had supposedly received the paper.
 
 The board, however, didn’t cancel the paper and informed the police one and a half hours after the examination.
 
 Police suspect the role of an insider. Sources said the mails could also have come from one of the teachers reportedly part of the WhatsApp group through which the papers were circulated. Police expect the information from Google to help them trace the sender. 
 
 During questioning, the CBSE’s controller of examination told police that exam papers are usually transported in sealed packets, which can only be cut open. Sources said the images circulating on the WhatsApp groups appeared to be clicked after putting the papers on a bed. 
 
 Police suspect that the person who leaked the papers might have managed to remove a full set, which is possible only if he/she had access to cases carrying the papers.
