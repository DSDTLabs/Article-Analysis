Bathinda: Students of University College of Nursing of the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, were in for a shock when an unidentified person barged into their hostel on Tuesday night. It is the third such instance in the last two months in the hostel which houses around 400 girl students.

 Till now, the university authorities had dismissed the reports of any intruder entering the hostel. On Tuesday night, images of the person were recorded in the CCTV camera, making the authorities swing into action. The hostel inmates held a protest on Wednesday and demanded proper security. Going by the situation, the warden of the hostel was shifted on Wednesday and BFUHS vice-chancellor assured foolproof security in future.
 
 Some inmates said that they saw an unidentified person barge into the hostel by scaling the boundary wall on Tuesday night. They said he tried to look into the rooms and when they raised an alarm, the man fled but his images were recorded on CCTV cameras.
 
 Vice-chancellor of BFUHS Raj Bahadur has also confirmed the incident. He said that, “I have met the students and assured them of full security in the hostel. The hostel warden has been shifted and security handed over to ex-servicemen. The infrastructure is being strengthened.”
