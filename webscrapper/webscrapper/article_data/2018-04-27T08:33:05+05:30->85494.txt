CHANDIGARH: The   government has decided to re-launch Amritsar Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and the trial run will held by June-end. Local bodies’ minister   stated this after a meeting of group of ministers constituted to look into revival of BRTS. He added that the project would be fully operational by September.

 “About Rs 600 crore has already been pumped into the project and nearly 100 buses have been gathering dust. Therefore, it has been decided to give the project another push. Some of the projects of the public works department would be completed shortly and five bridges are coming up,” said Sidhu.
 
 Sources said in the meeting of the subcommittee of the cabinet, it was decided that as a welfare state, the government should bear any losses initially for the sake of public transport. The project may not be able to break even and the state may have to bear losses for the first few years. State finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal agreed to set aside funds to make the project work.
 
 “The BRTS project has not worked in most cities because buses do not get right of way but in Amritsar roads have been widened. Besides, satellite bus stands are coming up in Amritsar that will ensure that there is higher frequency of buses so that passengers do not have for more than 3-4 minutes,” he added.
 
 “You cannot have a modern city without an efficient public transport system. What the Akalis did was to prematurely launch the project. We will ensure that the project works,” the minister said.
 
 “Around 1.25 lakh devotees come to pay obeisance at Sri Darbar Sahib daily. Keeping this in mind, the project will take off at all costs. The project would be initiated full throttle by September 2018 and all buses would be run,” he added.
