Sports has always been something that I have wanted to be associated with, in some way or the other. Although, I have never played professionally, I have participated in sports in school and outside. I am also an ardent follower of football and motor sport.

 After completing my bachelor’s in management studies, I looked towards ‘events’ as a possible route to working in sports. Beyond that, event management as a concept has always appealed to me. Pairing the two sounded like a viable and interesting career option, something that I could truly say I wanted to do!
 
 I completed my postgraduate diploma in event management. In hindsight, it was great to get a broader perspective of events as a platform, which began to shape the way I thought about my next few jobs, which were sports-oriented. I started working on freelance projects, followed by my first full-time job with a company more directly involved in grassroots football training. I was glad to be involved in football, where I actively contributed to the operations of   schools and co-ordination of events.
 
 Realising that operations is one of my strengths, I continued dealing with events and operations in each of my other jobs, including a leisure sailing company. When I joined South United four years ago, I learnt more and built on my strengths in the field.
 
 Now as general secretary of South United FC, a football club based in Bangalore, I overlook the operations of the club. I also oversee the servicing of other business verticals such as soccer schools, events, facility management, etc. across Mumbai and Bangalore, as well as the movement into different businesses. While deciding and focusing on job profiles, career paths, and planning is important; nothing can compare to making the most of your time and getting experience within the industry.
