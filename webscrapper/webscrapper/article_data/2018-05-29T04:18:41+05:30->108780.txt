GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister   announced on Monday that his government was in the final stages of bringing out a comprehensive   for the state. The long pending ‘State Water Policy’ will be a roadmap for future judicious use and replenishment of the precious but fast depleting resource. Reuse of treated waste water as well as water pricing are components of the State Water Policy, claim government officials. A draft water policy was initially prepared in 2014-15 but was pending approval from the then chief minister  . 

 The present draft policy was prepared with aims of planning, development and management of water resources considering local, regional, state and national context with a holistic perspective encompassing human, social, economic and ecological needs. 
 
 According to the draft policy, water will be managed as a common pool community resource held by the state under public trust doctrine to achieve food security, support livelihood, and ensure equitable and sustainable development for all. It says that community participation in water management will be given priority to instil the trusteeship amongst society. 
 
 To bridge the gap between the demand and supply, supply and demand management be given equal importance – need and importance based water allocation, water use efficiency, recycling and reuse of water, treatment of effluent and water pricing will be the means for the same.
 
 Rupani will shortly convene a meeting of all departments in the coming weeks and place the draft policy for discussion before them and then take the policy to the cabinet for approval when it meets in June later weeks. 
 
 At present, the state is passing through a major water crisis but has no long- or short-term policy or action plan. Experts have raised concern over the state's ad hoc approach. Despite passing through most critical times in water availability state government has almost forgotten the State Water Policy draft.
