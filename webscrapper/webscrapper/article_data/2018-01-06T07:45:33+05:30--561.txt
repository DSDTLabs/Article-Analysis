HYDERABAD: To mobilise funds for major projects and also ensure proper maintenance of  , the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority ( ) has decided to hand over the job of ORR toll collection and maintenance to a private player on a long-term basis.

 HMDA has already appointed consultants and if everything goes as per plan, toll collection and maintenance of the 158-km ORR will, from June 2018, be given to a private concessionaire, who will operate it on a Toll Operate and Transfer (TOT) basis.
 
 “Two days ago, we appointed LEA Associates   and CRISIL as transaction advisor and technical consultant for handing over the ORR to a private player on a TOT basis. They will submit a report on revenue and cost projections to arrive at the final figures for calling for bidders. After that, two more months are required for completing the bidding process,” HMDA chief general manager B Anand Mohan told TOI. Based on projections, HMDA will decide whether the lease should be for a 20 or 30-year period, he added.
 
 As of now, HMDA has engaged a private agency, M/s Eagle Infra, to collect ORR toll. The agency has been paying about ₹16.5 crore a month to HMDA. Maintenance of the ORR has become a major concern for HMDA, especially the 22-km stretch between   and Shamshabad. A funds crunch too played a key role in HMDA opting for a private player, sources said.
 
 According to HMDA officials, the advantage of TOT is that the private concessionaire will pay an upfront lump sum amount to HMDA, which can be utilized for various infrastructure projects. The private player will also maintain the ORR during the concession period. As per preliminary estimates, HMDA is likely to get ₹2,000-3,000 crore as upfront fee for 20-year period. The system is being followed by   on some stretches and Centre too has asked states to adopt TOT for expressways and state highways.
