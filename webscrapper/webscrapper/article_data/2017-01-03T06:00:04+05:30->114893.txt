AHMEDABAD: Ankit Dave, a resident of Satellite, went to a two-wheeler showroom to buy a bike. Though helmet was mentioned in the bill which contained a list of items delivered to Dave but the headgear remained only on paper. 

 Another customer   had to shell out Rs 350 for getting the   (HSRP) fitted to his four-wheeler at a showroom. 
 
 The common aspect of these two cases is the notification issued by the state transport department which makes it mandatory for the   to give helmets and HSRP to their customers for free. However, most of the vehicle dealers were found to be flouting the transport department’s norms when contacted by the TOI. 
 
 On Monday the state transport department held a meeting with vehicle dealers in the city and once again asked them not to charge extra for fitting HSRP or giving helmets. 
 
 “We have asked the vehicle dealers to fit number plates at their showrooms before delivering vehicles and also that a helmet is mandatory for two-wheeler registrations,” said a state transport department official.
 
 State transport minister   said, “People should insist on getting HSRP number plate fitted by the dealers and should refuse to pay Rs 350. If we get a complaint, we will take action against the erring dealers.” About the helmet, the minister said that buyers should refuse to take delivery of a two-wheeler if the free helmet is not given. 
 
 However, since December the dealers have been charging their customers Rs 350 for fitting number plates despite a directive issued by the state government in September that no vehicle should be delivered by dealers unless fitted with the HSRP number plate.
 
 The government had warned that vehicle owners will be fined if HSRP number plates were not found on their vehicles. 
 
 The fine for a two-wheeler will be Rs 100, for a three-wheeler Rs 200, and for cars and other light motor vehicles penalty will be Rs 300. Other vehicles will be fined Rs 500, if the HSRP number plates are found missing.
