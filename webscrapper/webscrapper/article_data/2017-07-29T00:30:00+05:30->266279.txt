Bhopal: BJP nominee for Rajya Sabha by-poll​​ Sampatiya Uike filed her nomination papers, on Friday, the last day of filing nominations. ​Uike was accompanied by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP state chief Nandkumar Singh Chauhan among other senior leaders. Talking to reporters, chief minister Chouhan said that party's decision to nominate Uike for Rajya Sabha was symbolic to honour of tribals, women and party workers who dedicated themselves for the party since last many years. 

 “The decision to nominate Uike for Rajya Sabha would empower tribals and village dwellers. Uike had worked in rural areas to strengthen the party in remote villages. Her contribution to empower women in tribal areas was outstanding and motivational,” said chief minister Chouhan.
 
 Rejecting allegations against Uike, BJP state chief Chauhan said Congress had plans to defame BJP leaders. She will represent the tribal community in the Upper House and would raise voice in their favour.
 
 “Congress allegations are baseless and we thank party president Amit Shah to have nominated Uike for the seat,” said Chauhan.
 
 Reacting to the nomination Uike thanked the party and said, “I will make every possible efforts to raise and solve the problems of tribals,” said Uike.
 
 By-poll for the single Rajya Sabha seat in the state fell vacant following the death of former Union minister Anil Madhav Dave in May this year. The scrutiny of nomination papers will be done on Saturday and the last date for withdrawing nominations is July 31.
 
 There is only one candidate Dr K Padmarajan who has filed nomination for the seat as an independent candidate. In case there are more contestants, polling will be held on August 8, said Election Commission officials.
