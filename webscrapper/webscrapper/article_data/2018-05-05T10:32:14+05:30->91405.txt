HYDERABAD: Seeking to alert leaders of various political parties about falling into the “federal front trap” being proposed by   chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesperson and general secretary Dasoju Sravan has written letters to   chief Mayawati, JD-S chief H D Deve Gowda, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, UP ex-CM   and DMK’s Stalin.

 
 In the letter, the Congress party urged the leaders to be cautious against KCR, stating that he is projecting himself as the messiah of democracy. In reality,   is a dictator who neither believes in democracy nor in constitution, he said.
 
 He alleged that KCR has adopted a deceptive rhetoric about ‘need for qualitative change in national politics’ to pursue his secret goal of benefiting the BJP. “KCR may overtly appear to be criticizing   and Congress, but covertly he is a strong supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his rhetoric is under the influence of Amit Shah,” he said.
 
 He accused KCR of implementing ‘most malicious strategy of disintegrating solidarity of anti-BJP political parties’.
