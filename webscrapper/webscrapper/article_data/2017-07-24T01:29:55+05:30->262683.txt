GHAZIABAD: A park in Abhay Khand of   has been swamped with sewer water for the past three days, leaving local residents with no outdoor space. The area, which is flooded with toxic water, has sent   officials in a tizzy over the revival of flora that had been developed with great effort over the past decade.

 The park,  , is adjacent the Vaishali bridgein front of St Francis School in Indirapuram. Developed in 2008 by GDA on a green belt in a valley between two parallel roads connecting NH-24 with the Kanawani Bridge on CISF Road, the park, around 500m long and 20m wide, serves as a green lung for thousands of residents in Indirapuram and Vaishali.
 
 According to GDA officials, a sewer pipeline running along the length of the park burst open on during the heavy rains on Thursday morning leading to the inundation. Caretakers of the park living inside the compound, however, said some officials broke the sewer pipeline after Thursday’s showers, which led to the flooding. 
 
 “Indirapuram and Vaishali are short of adequate green spaces and parks. It reeks of government apathy that sewer water has been left inside a park that will invariably lead to the death of plants. Residents who used to walk and jog in the park are now using the roads for the purpose. It is a complete waste of money,” said BK Pandey, a resident of Vaishali’s sector 5.
 
 Officials of the GDA said the sewer pipeline belongs to the UP Jal Nigam. “The pipeline is maintained by the Jal Nigam. It transports sewer from Trans-Hindon areas like Chandra Nagar and Surya Nagar to the 75 MLD treatment plant in Indirapuram,” GDA executive engineer Chakresh Jain told TOI.
 
 Sources said the pipeline burst open because the STP belonging to the Jal Nigam in Indirapuram was not functional. “We have spoken to Jal Nigam officials who have assured that the dirty water will be cleared soon. A plan of action will be worked out to revive the park thereafter,” GDA horticulture officer, SP Shisodia, told TOI.
