AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday upheld the state government’s decision of not renewing permission of a processing unit that is within 500 metre of the Girnar Sanctuary near Junagadh.

 Balaji Processors had set up a dry clothes processing unit and obtained permission to operate. 
 
 In 2015, the   ( ) did not renew the permission on the ground that no polluting industry can be permitted near the sanctuary, particularly in the eco-sensitive zone.
 
 In 2016, Balaji Processors moved the HC and challenged the government’s decision to revoke the permission granted to it earlier. 
 
 Meanwhile, the eco-sensitive zone area has been expanded to 5km. GPCB opposed the industrial unit’s demand to quash the decision to revoke the permission. 
 
 A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje upheld the government’s decision that a polluting unit cannot be allowed to operate in the buffer zone of a sanctuary.
