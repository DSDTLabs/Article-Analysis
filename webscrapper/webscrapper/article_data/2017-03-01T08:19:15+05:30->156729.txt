BENGALURU: Bengaluru has a long way to go in   it's transparency in citizen delivery systems or  . The fact was re-established in an annual  's City-Systems, in which Bengaluru has slipped from rank 12 in 2015 to rank 16 in 2016. 

 The Annual Survey of India's City-Systems (ASICS), released by   on Tuesday, ranked 21major cities from 18 states in the country, looking into 83 parameters based on the City-Systems framework.
 
 Cities were ranked on a scale of 0 to 10 and the average score of Indian cities was found to be between 2.1 and 4.4. The figure is much lower against the global benchmarks of London and New York, which score 9.3 and 9.8, respectively. VR Vachana, associate, advocacy and reforms, Janaa graha, said, “The survey is not an indicator of quality of life in these cities. Like a thorough health check-up, the survey highlights the deep systemic flaws that exist in urban governance.“
 
 Overall, Indian cities have continued to score low over the past four editions of ASICS. This indicates that progress on fixing City-Systems has been slow. Vachana said: “In case of Bengaluru, the survey indicates several systemic inadequacies in governance that could affect public service delivery. Even though the overall scores have not changed for Bengaluru, the drop in rank is on account of improvements in scores of smaller cities such as Bhubaneswar, Ahmedabad, Raipur and Ranchi.“ The survey said Thiruvananthapuram retained No. 1 position in 2016. Pune came second, up two ranks over 2015, and Kolkata, third, same as 2015. The biggest gainer in 2016 was Bhubaneswar, which jumped eight ranks to the 10th spot. This jump was on the back of a slew of reforms such as instituting municipal cadres, tiered spatial planning at the ward level and a single-window clearance process for development projects.
