GAYA: A   bench on March 28 stayed fresh appointment of 22 principals of Magadh   (MU).

 Earlier, while disposing of MJC no 124/18, a Patna high court bench on February 8 had scrapped the existing panel comprising 22 principals prepared by the then VC Prof Md Ishtiaq and directed the MU authorities to go for fresh recruitment as per revised   norms.
 
 The sealed panel is with the Patna high court registry. The SC has requisitioned the sealed panel for its perusal. The high court scrapped the panel on the apprehension expressed by the university that the somewhat controversial panel might have contained some tainted names facing vigilance probe. Though, the posts were advertised in 2008 and appointments were made twice, each time appointments were quashed by   as well as Supreme Court. The Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) has been filed in the SC by one of the aspirants for the principalâ€™s post, Jitendra Rajak.
 
 While staying the HC order regarding fresh recruitments, the SC has given four weeks time to the state government,   and other respondents to submit their reply.
 
 In 2008, when the posts were first advertised, the post of a principal was a cadre post, separate from other teaching positions. Once appointed to the post, the appointee was eligible to hold the post till superannuation, dismissal, resignation or incapacitation.
 
 The UGC subsequently changed the nature of the post from cadre post to tenure post. As per new rules, principals are to be appointed for a fixed period of five years, after which, they are sent back to their previous teaching positions. Magadh University has also changed the recruitment rule to make it in sync with UGC norms.
