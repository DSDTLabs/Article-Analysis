NEW DELHI: Classes resumed at   on Monday amid heavy police presence even as a feeling of anxiety hung in the air. The number of students who attended classes was, however, much lower than usual. 

 The campus remained out of bounds for 'outsiders' - students were allowed in after showing ID cards. While some students went ahead with practice sessions for various fests, a few classes were suspended because some teachers stayed away.
 
 ABVP, with support of the   Students' Union, organised a 'Tiranga Yatra', which was opposed by another section of students. A lecturer, who didn't want to be identified, said: "Many students stayed away as the situation is still not calm on the campus."  , a statistics student, however, countered by saying that the "environment is already calm and we will have normalcy again".
 
 A student organiser of the seminar that had triggered ugly scenes stayed away, fearing more backlash. "I am scared of going back to college," he said.
