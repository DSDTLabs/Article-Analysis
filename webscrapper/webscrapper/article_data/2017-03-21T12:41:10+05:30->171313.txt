The programme was held at  . The release was the third volume of five books which include selected articles on different subjects published between 1989 to 2017.

 Chief guest Shripad Joshi, president of  , said, “In 1989, Dr   founded MANS, a body for eradication of superstition and blind faith in Maharashtra and campaigned against superstitions, confronting dubious tantriks and self-claimed ‘babas’ who promised ‘miracle cures’ for ailments.”
 
 “He took it upon himself to bring about a change in the society. Hence, for 25 long years he continuously wrote articles against superstition which made it a subject of hot discussion, just like religion, science, social issue etc,” said Joshi. 
 
 All these years, Dabholkar made several attempts, albeit unsuccessful ones, to get an anti-superstition law enacted in the state legislature. Under his supervision, MANS drafted the Anti-Jaadu Tona Bill (Anti-Superstition and Black Magic Ordinance),” Joshi said.
 
 He further said, “The activities of Dabholkar were opposed by some political parties who claimed that it would adversely affect Hindu culture, customs and traditions. Many critics had accused him of being anti-religion but in an interview with the Agence France-Presse news agency, he had said, ‘In the whole bill, there's not a single word about God or religion. ”
 
 Addressing the gathering Manohar said, “Dabholkar was a revolutionary littérateur and his thoughts were intellectualist. This anti-superstition topic would work against the topics like intolerance, etc in our secular state.”
 
 Manohar summed up his planned murder saying, “You can destroy a man but you cannot defeat him.”
 
  MANS members Avinash Patil, Vijay Salankar and Mahadeorao Bhuibhar, Prabhakar Nanavati and Rahul Dhorat were also present.
