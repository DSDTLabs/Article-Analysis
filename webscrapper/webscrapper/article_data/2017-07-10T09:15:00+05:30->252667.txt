Panaji: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the mining   worth about Rs 35,000 crore in   is contemplating making   traders witnesses to tighten its case against errant companies involved. Investigation has revealed that the companies are involved in 13 different types of violations.

 Earlier, the SIT, had issued summons to directors of eight mining companies for questioning. But a senior officer said the team had realized that summoning the companies is futile for they send their senior employees who do not provide much information.
 
 “We were unable to get information from the companies. So we have decided to investigate from bottom and started calling in traders,” the officer said.
 
 Senior officers serving on the SIT said besides the approximately 400 traders registered with the directorate of mines and geology, there are hundreds of unregistered traders involved in   mining.
 
 The SIT has identified traders having turnovers of over Rs 5 crore to be questioned in illegal mining cases. It has also found that companies involved in illegal mining had created these traders to evade liabilities arising out of illicit practices.
 
 Investigation revealed that during peak mining period, huge sums of money were deposited in traders accounts, more than half of which were transferred later the same day to the mining company that had hired them. The rest of the money were also withdrawn the same day.
 
 “If traders cooperate with the investigation, divulge all information on illegal mining and reveal which companies they were operating for, then we will make them witnesses so that we can reach to the root of the case,” a senior SIT officer said. “If the traders don’t cooperate, then we will go after for them to get all the documents,” he added.
 
 A few weeks ago, the SIT had arrested the first trader — Kancha Gaunder hailing from Salem in Tamil Nadu and residing in Tisk-Usgao — for illegal extraction and theft of iron   worth crores.
