CHENNAI: The interiors of the 150-year-old   housing the office of the DGP got a facelift at a cost of 60 lakh.

It took them at least 10 months to complete their task. Now,   officials are working on the rooms used by the additional director-general of police (ADGP - law and order) and ADGP administration.
 
 "We brought in a restoration expert and held discussions with Archaeological Survey of India officials on restoring the original structures without damaging them," a senior police officer at TNPHC said. 
 
 "The building had a lot of flower motifs and neatly  , which were  . Now, we removed all the false ceiling and the original antique designs are on display," the officer added.
 
 Likewise, the doors and windows were painted white over the original teak wood. Workers had safely removed the white coat restoring the original teak. "The room looks entirely different and adds a new ambience to the office," said a senior police officer.
 
 The exterior of the DGP police office building - the state police headquarters - was recommended for demolition in 2000 after the paint on many exterior walls began peeling off due to the sea breeze.
