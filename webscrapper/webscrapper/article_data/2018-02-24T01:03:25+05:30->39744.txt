Greater Noida: A group of lawyers on Friday protested at Jewar toll plaza, demanding a high court bench in western UP. The lawyers lifted toll barriers and allowed free passage of vehicles for half an hour on both sides. Senior officials of district administration and police reached the spot and pacified them. Rajiv Tongad, president, GB Nagar Bar association, said lawyers have been protesting at different district courts in western UP for the past four days.

 He said the lawyers have been demanding a high court bench in western UP for several years. He said that Maharashtra has 12 crore population, but it has a high court in Mumbai, and two benches in Nagpur and Aurangabad. “UP has 22 crore population, but there is only one high court in Allahabad and one bench in Lucknow. The people in western UP are facing difficulties in pursuing their cases in Allahabad high court due to the distance. The number of pending cases in the high court is also increasing every day,” he said.
 
 The lawyers’ group – Committee for the formation of HC Bench – on February 17 called a meeting in Meerut and decided to sit on protest from February 19 to 26 in all the courts in western UP. “The lawyers have been protesting for four days but the government did not take notice. We urge the Prime Minister and UP chief minister to address the issue,” said advocate Aditya Bhati.
 
 On Friday, the lawyers visited the Yamuna Expressway’s Jewar toll plaza and lifted the toll barriers allowing free passage to vehicles. They also submitted a memorandum to district magistrate B N Singh over the issue.
 
 The protest ended when they were assured that their demands will be forwarded to the government.
