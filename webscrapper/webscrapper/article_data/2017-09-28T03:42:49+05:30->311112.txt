NEW DELHI: In an attempt to increase public private partnership in conservation and maintenance of   sites, the tourism ministry on Wednesday launched the ‘Adopt a Heritage’ scheme, inviting private and public sector companies to become ‘Monument Mitras’.

 The ‘friends of monuments’ will adopt heritage sites, develop basic and advanced amenities at monuments and look after their operation and maintenance. For their services, Monument Mitras will be “given visibility” on the monument premises as well as on the tourism ministry’s Incredible India website.
 
 The ‘Adopt a Heritage’ scheme is a repackaged version of the existing   (NCF) — in operation since 1996 — under which private firms can offer to preserve and protect tangible and intangible heritage in India and choose to develop amenities, undertake research or offer funds for building or maintaining a heritage project.
 
 Among those recently undertaken for conservation as NCF projects was Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi, which was completed by the   and   of Hotels.
 
 In the present form, the ‘Adopt a Heritage’ project focuses on 93 ASI-ticketed monuments to begin with. It will be expanded to include other natural and cultural sites across India. The ministry has divided heritage sites into various categories and ‘Monument Mitras’ will be given the choice of adopting sites of varied visibility and footfalls as a package.
 
 The key focus area, tourism secretary Rashmi Verma said on Wednesday, will be on basic amenities like cleanliness, public conveniences, drinking water facilities, signages and ease of access.
 
 Among advanced amenities they may choose to offer include cafes, surveillance, tourist facilitation centres, etc.
