Though there are several cookery shows that are being telecast on television, Global Kitchen is quite different, says anchor  . “Cookery shows are mostly about native food. But in this one, we speak to chefs who make international cuisine in Chennai. The format of the show is such that we go to authentic global cuisine restaurants in the city and speak to the chefs about their signature dishes. We later get them to the studio and make them cook three or four dishes. We have covered Malaysian, Mexican and Tibetan cuisine. We will explore dishes from other countries, too,” says Deepthi. 

 Apart from anchoring, Deepthi has multiple things going on for her. She has just finished a sound production course in AR Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory and is also a regular in short films. “I always wanted to be in the field of media. I want to promote independent music and become a composer someday. But before I enrolled for this course, I was already a video jockey. Ever since I was a child, I was on stage. So, I have no stage or camera fear. I love chatting with people and talking about things I love. As much as it is interesting, being a VJ also has its cons. You need to have a parallel career going on as the finances wouldn’t suffice. Nevertheless, it is fun to host,” she says. So, does she have an interest in acting, too? “Oh yes. I have done a few short films,” she signs off.
