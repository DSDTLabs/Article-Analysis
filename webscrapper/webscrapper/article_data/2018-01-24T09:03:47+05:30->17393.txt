SURAT: A group of parents of students studying in Delhi Public School (DPS), Surat, met district education officer U N Rathod to register a complaint against the school authorities, but failed to get a satisfactory reply from his office here on Tuesday. The parents are opposing hike in fees by the school when the state government has passed an Act to regulate the fees and opposing deductions through electronic clearance service (ECS) directly from their bank accounts.

 DPS, Surat, circulated a letter to parents last week instructing them that the school will be deducting fees from their bank accounts directly. The parents were informed that the fees will be deducted on January 24 from their bank accounts as per the existing system in the school. At least 40 parents approached the school, but they were turned away. 
 
 “The school intimated us through a letter on January 22 that it will collect the hiked fees on January 24 through ECS from our accounts. We went to discuss the issue, but we were humiliated. We approached the DEO and submitted our demands and are hopeful to get some relief,” a parent Vimal Soni said.
 
 “Some parents had come to me with the issue of hiked fees and the money being deducted through ECS. They have submitted their complaint, but I can’t do anything. Only the Fees Regulation Committee formed by the state government can address the fee-related issues,” Rathod said. 
 
 “We did not collect hiked fees last year. We are unable to increase salary of our teachers due to financial issues and they are leaving. We are increasing the fees as per   rules and collecting through ECS,” pro vice-chairman of DPS, Surat, Pradeep Kumar said.
