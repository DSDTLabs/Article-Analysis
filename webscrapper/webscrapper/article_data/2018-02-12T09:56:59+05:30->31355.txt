I had by then told the Hyderabad media of my decision to quit. And today, AIMPLB is saying they sacked me. When I already quit from the board, how can they sack me?
 
 
 
 
 A: The first meeting was held in Lucknow through video conferencing and then we met him in Bengaluru with a delegation. UP Sunni   chairman Zufar Farooqui also accompanied me. The next meeting will be held in Ayodhya with seers and clerics. It is not about Sri Sri alone, we will meet others too like Shankaracharya and the PM. None of my meetings was under wraps and I stand by what I said.
 
 
 
 A: For 25 years, courts have not been able to decide on the case. Even if it does, it will hurt one of the communities. I believe only an outof-court settlement will work. The Muslim law board has been taken over by hardliners, but nobody protested when idols were placed inside the mosque in 1949 or locks were reopened by  .
 
 
 
 
 A: I have been a theology teacher for 40 years and I am proposing a solution through Islamic law. If Islam has a provision to move a mosque, why should we not do so for cause of peace? In return we can ask for a   guarantee that other Islamic religious sites will not be touched and compensation will be given to post-Babri riot victims.
 
 
 
 
 A: What is the guarantee that when the court gives a decision, there will be no violence in the country? Give me three months and through constructive talks, we will definitely find a solution.
