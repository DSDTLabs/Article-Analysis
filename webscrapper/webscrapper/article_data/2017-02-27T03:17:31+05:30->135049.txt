After a brief appearance in Nitesh Tiwari's   starrer 'Dangal' as a wrestler,   will now play the antagonist in the   directorial '  2', which features   in a double role, along with   and   Pannu. 

  
  
 The model turned actor will start shooting from mid-February. "David sir saw me in Nikkhil sir's (Nikkhil Advani) 'Hero' and told Mukesh (Mukesh Chhabra, casting director) that he wanted me for 'Judwaa 2'. He praised my work in the earlier film when we met at a party at Salman sir's ( ) farmhouse. He has shown a lot of faith in me," exults Vivan who has been sweating it out in the gym to shed the 10 kilos he had gained for 'Dangal'.
 
 "I play a stylish villain who's lean and smart. Aalim Hakim has given me a new hairstyle and we are also considering adding a few tattoos to my body. David sir wanted someone as tough who could take on the macho, muscular Varun and believes I suit the part."
 
 Vivan whose character will have some comic elements too, will be shooting for the London schedule around April. Prod him if, like Varun, he will be get to serenade Jackie and Taapsee in the sequel to Salman Khan's 1997 comedy, and he quips with a smile, "I doubt it but nothing's impossible." Que sera sera...
