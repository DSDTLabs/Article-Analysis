What’s interesting is that Varun had to learn the sport before he shot for the show.
  
  Commenting on learning the sport, Varun Sood said, “I am a basketball player and I had to play a footballer. I had no idea how to kick a ball, how to shoot, how to dribble and obviously I didn’t want to look like an idiot on camera. So a day before the shoot I was on the internet watching football videos on how to kick, how to dribble and how to look like a footballer. When I went on the sets and I was playing football, it was very new to me. As the shooting went on I started enjoying the sport. It was a lot of fun I have only done reality shows but this was very different. It was a very nice experience and very exhausting. I would love to do something of this sort again.”
